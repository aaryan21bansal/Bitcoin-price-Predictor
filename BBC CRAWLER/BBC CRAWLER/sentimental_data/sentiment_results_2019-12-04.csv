"Greta Thunberg was on the wrong side of the world. She'd taken 14 days to cross the Atlantic on a carbon-neutral journey via boat for climate change summits in the US and Chile. But at the last minute political unrest meant the Chile talks moved to Spain. She needed a crew to take her back to Europe - and she needed them quickly. That's when Nikki Henderson stepped in. ""I helped because I wanted to see what Greta was really like, get to know her and be able to educate myself about what she represents,"" the 26-year-old British sailor  tells Radio 1 Newsbeat. The problem was that Nikki was in the UK when she was asked byAustralian YouTubers Riley Whitelum and Elayna Carausuto join them on their yacht, ferrying Greta back to Europe. Nikki and Greta were joined on the boat by Greta's dad, YouTubers Riley Whitelum and Elayna Carausu and their baby, Lennon And with just two days notice she had no choice but to fly to meet them. She wascriticised,externalfor that decision as the whole mission was supposed to be carbon-neutral. ""In an ideal world, yes, I would have sailed there and sailed back,"" she says. ""But this is a more symbolic trip. Greta wanted to sail because it's a good way to send a message to the world that there is no real sustainable option to travel. ""She's not telling anyone how to travel, she's not telling anyone how to live their life."" So, Nikki, Greta, Greta's dad Svante, Riley, Elayna and the couple's baby Lennon set sail from Virginia, US on 13 November and spent nearly three weeks at sea on a 48-foot boat. ""We spent quite a lot of time together in quite a small space,"" Nikki says. ""We had most of our meals together. We sat outside together and had lots of conversations. We looked after Lenny the baby together."" But crossing the Atlantic in the winter isn't all about cosy dinners and sitting under the stars. ""We had a couple of nights in a lightning storm which was both amazing and, I suppose, quite scary,"" says Nikki. ""I saw a couple of streaks hit the water and spark quite close to the boat so they were quite tense nights although most people are looking out the windows and staring and saying: 'Wow'."" As a professional sailor, Nikki says that she knows to be prepared for the unexpected, but weather like this, 40-knot winds and five-metre high waves were ""pretty nerve wracking."" However experiences like these also helped her learn more about Greta. ""I think it takes a certain type of person to cross the Atlantic in the winter - she's obviously very brave,"" says Nikki. ""I take my hat off to her and her father for joining us. That was a pretty courageous thing to do."" ""They didn't do it for themselves, they did it to send a message. It felt very selfless."" After spending 19 days with her at sea, Nikki describes Greta as ""friendly, quiet and kind"" and says the experience has taught her why she is so ""captivating."" ""Her passion comes across if you know her as a person as well as if you see her on stage or you see a setting aside parliament on the floor,"" Nikki says. ""She's so captivating because she genuinely, authentically is true to her message in every way."" Nikki arrived in Lisbon with Greta on 3 December The boat landed in Lisbon, Portugal on 3 Decemberand Nikki says the arrival was a ""culture shock."" ""At sea you eat very simple food, you don't drink any alcohol, and you live a very simple life with no choice or showering,"" she says. ""Just seeing lots of people was a culture shock. Yesterday when we arrived in the dock, there were thousands and thousands of people."" After reaching land, Greta and Nikki will travel on to Madrid, but she believes the experience they shared with the boat's crew will make them friends for life. ""A trip like that across an ocean builds bonds that are very, very hard to recreate in any other areas of life. ""I'm coming off with four very good friends, which I'm sure we'll keep in contact with forever."" Nikki will return to the UK by train. While most people aren't able to sail across the Atlantic, Nikki does believe there are lessons to be learned from their journey. ""I think we did show that sailing across the Atlantic isn't very practical and that we do need more sustainable options available to the everyday person,"" she says. ""And I think there's definitely a message there about what you can achieve if you work together, compromise on certain areas of your life and you work with nature. ""You can achieve something really remarkable if you're if you're prepared to do that."" Follow Newsbeat onInstagram,external,Facebook,external,Twitter,externalandYouTube,external.

Blackford at the last election has now said she will support him on 12 December. Jean Davis, who stood for the Liberal Democrats in Ross,
Skye and Lochaber in the 2017 election, said she is lending the SNP
Westminster leader her vote as ""the best option to stop Brexit"". Ms Davies, who came third in 2017, said she would only vote for someone with a strong
connection to the constituency, who preferably lives there, and for someone
against Brexit. A full list of candidates in Ross, Skye & Lochaber is available here. Labour's shadow equalities spokeswoman Naz Shah has criticised Jeremy Corbynâs refusal
to apologise for anti-Semitism in the party in last weekâs Andrew Neil
interview. Mr Corbyn has since made an apology,in an interview with ITV's This Morning. But Naz Shah suggested he had not handled the issue well. Speaking at an election hustings for the Jewish community in
North London, she said Mr Corbyn had apologised in the past and this week, but added: âI would have done things differently."" Ms Shah was suspended by the Labour Party three years ago
for an anti-Semitic Facebook post published before she entered politics. But she has since
earned plaudits for making an effort to learn about anti-Semitism and build
bridges with the Jewish community. She said she wanted more people in the Labour Party to go on the ""same journey"" as her, admitting that she had known nothing about anti-Semitism. She defended Mr Corbynâs leadership, saying: âI have never
sold something I wouldnât buy. I definitely believe on a personal level that
Jeremy does care because I have had conversations with him.â But she added: âWhether he does it the right way and
whether he is getting it right is a different question. âAnd that is a conversation I want to continue with the
leadership.â Former Labour MP Chuka Umunna, who is now a Liberal
Democrat candidate, reacted angrily to her comments. He said: âI am so angry and so disappointed that good
people in the Labour Party defend the indefensible. ""I am fed up with it. He (Mr
Corbyn) is guilty of racism.

Welsh Labour leader Mark Drakeford says some traditional figures were put off by Jeremy Corbyn. Labour's Barry Gardiner says Robert Peston's interview with Boris Johnson reminded him of ""two men shouting at each other in the pub"". He says the PM did not answer Mr Peston's questions on Brexit and is ""running scared"" of scrutiny. Challenged over Labour's own Brexit position, Mr Gardiner says it is the only party in the election to give voters a ""final say"". Robert Peston has now moved onto an interview with Scottish First Minister and SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon. She says that she does not foresee a formal coalition with Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party - and would prefer to support any minority Labour government through more informal agreements on issues Labour and the SNP can agree on. Ms Sturgeon says her focus now is on ensuring Boris Johnson does not have a majority when the results are in on 13 December.

On tax policy, the prime minister says he believes the UK should be taxing online giants ""properly"". But he says this should be done fairly. As the interview concludes, a visibly agitated PM is asked - if he wins a majority - whether everyone will stop talking about Brexit after 31 January. Mr Johnson says yes - prompting a loud rebuke from Mr Peston of ""that's not true!"". The PM adds: ""What will happen is that the parliamentary agony will be over... the anguish will be over."" The Tories have said all of its parliamentary candidates support Mr Johnson's deal, but the PM says he has not ""forced"" prospective Conservative candidates to pledge their support. Asked by Robert Peston whether, for example, food standards are more important than a free-trade deal with the US, the PM does not agree or disagree but says ""we have massive opportunities and we need to seize them now"". Asked to name a deal that will happen as part of the ""tidal wave"" of investment post-Brexit, Mr Johnson claims Goldman Sachs says that there is Â£150bn riding on Britain leaving the EU. The PM adds that he doesn't wish to cite specific deals or people. Challenged by Robert Peston over his insistence that the UK is ""out of the EU"", the PM says the UK has chosen to have a transition period for the smoothness of business and that it was a choice that can be ended at any time. Mr Peston then confronts the PM with a printed version of his Brexit deal which he claims is 10% of the size of Theresa May's withdrawal agreement. Mr Johnson accuses the ITV journalist of being too pessimistic. Boris Johnson tells ITV's Robert Peston that getting Brexit done means more nurses in the NHS, more police officers, and moving the country forward. The PM says there is a ""tidal wave of investment"" ready to come into Britain once his Brexit deal is done. First, at a hustings, the Labour Party's Naz Shah, deputy shadow equalities minister, has apologised to the Jewish community for
the âhurt and pain that has been causedâ by her partyâs handling of anti-Semitism in its ranks. She was speaking at a hustings for the Jewish
community in North London. Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick urged the audience to âturn
the tide from anti-Semitismâ by voting Conservative. Chuka Umunna, for the Liberal Democrats, did not touch on the issue
of anti-Semitism in his opening remarks, talking instead about Brexit and cuts
to Londonâs policing budget. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Negative,0.00861984
"This video can not be played Jo Swinson on austerity vote: âI am sorry - it was not the right policy and we should have stopped it.â Jo Swinson has apologised for voting to cut benefits while serving in government with the Conservatives. The Liberal Democrat leader told the BBC's Andrew Neil her party had been wrong to back the so-called bedroom tax in the coalition government and ""we should have stopped it"". Although some cuts were needed when her party came into office in 2010, she suggested austerity had gone too far. Her party was committed to spend more on welfare and childcare, she added. During the 30-minute interview, Ms Swinson said she was determined to stop Brexit by whatever means possible, including working with other parties in the event of another hung Parliament to try and get another referendum. But she conceded the Lib Dems were unlikely to form the next government and be in a position to fulfil their campaign pledge to revoke Article 50 - the legal process for leaving the EU - without a further public vote. She said she disagreed with her predecessor Sir Vince Cable that the pledge had become an ""unhelpful distraction"" for the party, which has found itself being squeezed in the opinion polls during the campaign. Having only been elected leader in July, she insisted she was ""absolutely here to stay"" whatever the outcome on 12 December. Live: Latest from the campaign trail The 12 key policies in the Lib Dem manifesto Ms Swinson was repeatedly challenged on her party's record in government between 2010 and 2015 and her personal backing for cuts to benefits and Sure Start children's centres. She acknowledged she had voted nine times for the bedroom tax, the controversial policy which saw working-age families in council or housing association homes docked housing benefit if they were deemed to have more bedrooms than they needed. Ms Swinson, who served as a junior business minister in the Lib Dem/Conservative coalition between 2012 and 2015, was asked whether she would like to apologise to 240,000 of the poorest in society who suffered financially as a result and, in some cases, were forced into hardship. ""Yes, I am sorry I did that,"" she replied. ""It was not the right policy and we should have stopped it...I have previously said - and I am happy to say again - [it] was wrong. I am sorry about that and it is one of the things we did get wrong."" Asked about other welfare changes she backed at the time but is now committed to reversing, such as a cap on the overall amount of benefits a single household could receive, she said she had voted for them ""as someone with collective responsibility in government"". She said her party had ""won many battles"" with the Conservatives, such as in securing more money for children from disadvantaged backgrounds and taking many of the lowest paid out of income tax. But she said she accepted the public services had borne too much of the brunt of the government's drive to slash the deficit in the public finances. The coalition government made a priority out of rebalancing the public finances ""I am not going to say in a financial crisis that it was going to be possible with the deficit at the level it was in 2010 not to make any cuts at all,"" she said. ""Some cuts were necessary but the shape of those cuts, the balance between cuts and tax rises I don't think was the right balance."" Labour have long argued that austerity was a political choice and not a financial necessity. Ms Swinson said cuts were unavoidable and the level of retrenchment under the coalition mirrored the plans set out by Labour in its 2010 manifesto, How do election spending plans compare? Lib Dems warn of student mental health 'crisis' But pressed by Neil on whether austerity was a ""necessary evil or terrible mistake"", she replied: ""Clearly too much was cut, clearly not enough was raised from taxation. ""And certainly the investment should have kicked in earlier in terms of more borrowing for capital investment."" But she said these decisions were ""almost a decade ago"" and her party was now committed to scrapping the bedroom tax and addressing in-work poverty by reversing cuts to work allowances for families on Universal Credit and helping families with two earners. She said the Â£14bn the party was planning to spend on expanding free childcare - by funding 35 hours a week of provision for all children aged two to four - ""more than replaces the money that was cut"" during the coalition years. ""We have a plan for the future which identifies what our priorities are...and we are being upfront about where the money will come from."" In a special series of election interviews, Neil has already questioned Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and the SNP's Nicola Sturgeon, His interview with Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage will be broadcast on Thursday. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has yet to agree a date to taking part, which has prompted a political row and accusations from Labour that he is ""running scared"". The SNP launched an attack on Ms Swinson's record as part of the coalition government, following the interview. The party's Pete Wishart said: ""Despite Jo Swinson's best attempts to dodge her shameful record when in government with the Tories, the reality is communities across Scotland will not forgive or forget the Lib Dems for their active part in inflicting austerity on the most vulnerable people in society.""

"This video can not be played President Trump is on his best behaviour, but is everyone else? US President Donald Trump has called Justin Trudeau ""two-faced"" over a video in which the Canadian leader appears to mock him at a meeting of Nato leaders. Footage showed Mr Trudeau, UK PM Boris Johnson and French leader Emmanuel Macron discussing an impromptu press conference held by Mr Trump. Nato leaders agreed a statement of unity but the 70th anniversary meeting held near London also saw several rows. Mr Trump cancelled a press conference planned for after the summit. He told reporters: ""We'll go directly back. I think we've done plenty of news conferences."" The brief video posted on Twitter by Canada's public broadcaster, CBC, showed Mr Trudeau chatting with a group of leaders, including Mr Johnson, Mr Macron, Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, and Queen Elizabeth's daughter Princess Anne at Buckingham Palace. At the start of the footage, Mr Johnson asked Mr Macron: ""Is that why you were late?"" Mr Trudeau then interjects: ""He was late because he takes a 40-minute press conference off the top."" Five hot mics that got leaders in trouble Mr Macron then appears to tell an anecdote, but his words are drowned out by background noise. An amused Mr Trudeau then replies: ""Oh yeah, yeah, he announced... [inaudible]. You just watched his team's jaw drop to the floor."" None of them appeared to realise they were being recorded. This video can not be played Donald Trump says Justin Trudeau is ""two-faced"" - but Trudeau says they've a good relationship In response, Mr Trump said of Mr Trudeau: ""He's two-faced... I find him to be a nice guy, but the truth is I called him out on the fact that he's not paying 2% [of national GDP towards defence] and I guess he's not very happy about it. ""He's not paying 2% and he should be paying 2%. Canada - they have money. Look, I'm representing the US and he should be paying more than he's paying, he understands it... I can imagine he's not that happy but that's the way it is."" Asked about the video, Mr Johnson told reporters: ""It's complete nonsense. I don't know where that's come from."" Mr Trudeau later told reporters that they hadn't been laughing about Mr Trump's press conference, but about the location of the next G7 summit - Camp David, the US presidential country retreat. ""I have a very good relationship with Trump,"" he added. In the statement, Nato leaders said: ""To stay secure we must look to the future together."" It then acknowledged the ""challenges"" posed by China and Russia, and pledged to take ""stronger action"" against terrorism. This video can not be played Feuds reunited? The rifts behind Nato's big birthday Although the 29-member bloc's future is not in doubt, there are disagreements over Turkey's recent military action in northern Syria; the levels of military spending by members; and recent comments by Mr Macron that the alliance is ""brain dead"". Despite the divisions,Mr Johnson - the host of the event - described Nato as a ""giant shield of solidarity""that ""protects nearly a billion people"", saying at the start of the meeting at a luxury resort in Watford: ""As long as we stand together, no-one can hope to defeat us."" This video can not be played Boris Johnson tells fellow Nato leaders: ""Peace cannot be taken for granted"" Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg cited increased spending commitments on defence by European allies and Canada, saying: ""Nato is the most successful alliance in history because we've changed as the world has changed."" On Tuesday, he said those nations had added $130bn (Â£100bn) to defence budgets since 2016, and that this number would increase to $400bn by 2024. Mr Trump has frequently and forcefully criticised how much other allies spend on defence. The first day of the special anniversary summit saw tensions bubble to the surface, with Mr Trump and Mr Macronsparring over Nato's role, Turkey, and Islamic State group (IS) fightersduring a news conference. Relations between the two leaders were already strained amida dispute over taxes and trade, and comments from the French president last month that the US commitment to the alliance was fading. Troubled Nato not in party mood In pictures: 70 years of Nato What does the US do for Nato? Mr Trump, who once called Nato ""obsolete"", had earlier hit back by saying Mr Macron had been ""very disrespectful"" by describing Nato as ""brain dead"", calling them ""nasty"" comments. Mr Macron said he stood by his remarks. President Trump and Mr Johnson held unscheduled bilateral talks and, ahead of Wednesday's talks, Mr Trump tweeted they both had ""talked about numerous subjects including Nato and trade"". Nato, the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, started out in 1949 with just 12 countries as members but having now expanded to a bloc of 29, it is increasingly difficult for the alliance to project a united front. Nato estimates for 2019 show there are now eight countries - in addition to the US - meeting the target agreed by all members to spend 2% or more of their gross domestic product (GDP, a measure of economic output) on defence. Nato leaders attended a reception hosted by the Queen and Prince of Wales on Tuesday Before departing for London,Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan also said he would oppose a Nato defence planfor the Baltic region and Poland if the bloc did not support Turkey over its fight against Kurdish groups in Syria it considers terrorists. Mr Stoltenberg later told reporters that the alliance had been able to resolve the disagreement with Turkey, allowing Nato's plans to go ahead. The Queen talks to President Trump and his wife Melania during Tuesday's reception As well as the Turkish issue, talks had centred on the rising threats of China and Russia. After the summit, Mr Macron said that while Russia was a threat to Nato in some respects, in others the country could be a ""partner"". ""Around the table, would everyone recognise Russia as an enemy? I don't think that is the case,"" he told a news conference. ""On some topics Russia is seen as a threat, this is true... But Russia is also a partner in some issues. We're working and having concrete discussions with Russia on certain issues.""

"This video can not be played PM: 'I absolutely promise' UK out of EU by January Boris Johnson has promised to pass his Brexit deal and bring a Budget within 100 days if he is elected PM. The Tory leader said it would includehis pledge to raise the National Insurance threshold to Â£9,500, along with cash for schools and the NHS. He has pledged a ""new government with a new approach"" - with a focus on better infrastructure, education and technology. But Labour said Tories only offered ""more of the same failure"". The Lib Dems called the Conservative plans ""pure fantasy"", while the SNP warned there were seven days left to ""lock"" Mr Johnson out of Downing Street. LIVE: One week to go until voting day What does 'Get Brexit done' mean? Sajid Javid EU trade deal claim fact-checked How much tax do British people pay? Voters will go to the polls on 12 December for the third election in just over four years. Mr Johnson said he would set out his wider legislative agenda in a Queen's Speech pencilled in for 19 December if he gets back into No 10. He promised this would build onthe programme that was approved by Parliament as recently as October, but which was then effectively mothballed after MPs voted to back an early election. And he has committed to bringing his EU withdrawal agreement back for initial approval by MPs before Christmas. ""All we need is a working majority to deliver it. Every single one of our candidates has signed up to this deal,"" Mr Johnson said. He said the possibility that a Conservative government could fail to reach a post-Brexit trade deal with the EU by the end of 2020 ""simply will not happen"". This 11-month deadline covers thetransition periodthat would follow if the UK left the EU in January, which critics say does not leave enough time to negotiate such a deal and could mean the UK ends up without one. They include former Tory Justice Secretary - and now independent candidate -David Gauke, who said leaving without a deal would be ""disastrous for the prosperity of our countryâ¦ [making] whole sectors unviable"". But Mr Johnson said the UK was in a ""zero-tariff, zero-quota position"" already, which would make the talks easier. He added: ""Look at what we achieved in three months with the deal I did"". In an interview with ITV's This Morning, he said a trade deal with the EU was a ""very exciting prospect"", could be agreed ""by the end of next year"". Mr Johnson's plan for the first 100 days gives a timetable to a number of his existing pledges from the campaign trail, including: Raising the National Insurance threshold, which the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies says will save workers about Â£85 per year Ending the automatic release of serious violent and sexual offenders Increasing the amount migrants pay for using the NHS Finalising an agreement with mobile operators over countryside coverage The Conservatives have also said they would introduce a number of pieces of legislation in the 100-day timeframe to take the first steps on other promises including: A law to raise minimum per pupil funding in schools A law to ensure Â£33.9bn is put into the NHS each year by 2023 A new points-based immigration system The roll-out of gigabit broadband Mr Johnson vowed that, in government, the Tories would prioritise their plan to raise the National Insurance threshold, as it would deliver a tax cut for ""those who need the most help with the cost of living"". But Labour,which is making an announcement of its own on schools funding on Thursday, said the Conservatives' record in office over the past nine-and-a-half years was one of total failure. ""In those days we've seen child poverty soar, rising homelessness, rising food bank use, and violent crime is up too while the NHS has more people waiting for operations, and record staff vacancies,"" said shadow communities secretary Andrew Gwynne. ""As the Conservatives approach 3,500 days of failure, it's clear that more of the same failed austerity, privatisation and tax giveaways for the few is not the answer."" And as she prepared to embark on a week-long election bus tour, SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon said her party was the only one in Scotland capable of thwarting Mr Johnson's ""extreme Brexit"". ""If Boris Johnson wins a majority in seven days' time, Scotland will be dragged out of Europe within just eight weeks,"" she said. ""We have seven days to escape Brexit, lock Boris Johnson out of office and put Scotland's future in Scotland's hands.""

"The Conservative Party launched its 2019 election manifesto, with the slogan Get Brexit Done, Unleash Britain's Potential. It sets out the policies the party aimed to introduce should it win the election, which it has now done by a huge majority. Thefull document,externalran to 59 pages. But what were the promises that the party hoped would grab the public's attention? Reintroduce maintenance grants for nursing students. At present, there are just under 300,000 full-time equivalent posts. The party hopes to train more nurses by reintroducing maintenance grants of between Â£5,000 and Â£8,000 a year for students. The scrapping of these grants in 2017 was controversial and was followed by a fall in applicants. So, it is something of a U-turn. However, the policy will not involve a return to the pre-2017 policy of free tuition for nursing students. The 50,000 figure is reached by including foreign recruitment and policies for better retention of nurses. Labour promised to recruit 24,000 nurses - based on higher numbers in training - and introduce free tuition fees and maintenance grants. Healthcare is devolved so these policies would apply to England only, but Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales would benefit from the funding. 11 charts on why the NHS matters in this election Is the NHS the best health service possible?

In the least surprising promise in this manifesto, Boris Johnson made a personal guarantee that he would get Brexit ""done"" in January if he won a majority. He said that will end the political divisions in the country, but that seems unlikely. The Conservatives also promise to negotiate a trade deal with the EU next year, and confirm that they will not extend the post-Brexit transition period beyond December 2020. That is an incredibly short amount of time to finalise a trade deal of any significant ambition, and it means the EU knows in advance what the UK's negotiating deadlines are. The Conservatives say the UK will be outside the EU single market, and any form of customs union. But until we know the terms of a new relationship with the EU, it will be hard to argue that Brexit has really been done. This policy would apply to the whole of the UK. What does 'Get Brexit done' mean? A little bit more spending - and a bit more tax. There were no rabbits out of the hat, no huge tax cuts, or rises, and no big ticket new spending item. By design, the tax and spend numbers were smaller than those of the Liberal Democrats and, especially, Labour. They have space to do a lot more within the new borrowing rules. But Chancellor Sajid Javid and Prime Minister Boris Johnson want to keep a tight ship. There will be a little bit more spending and a bit more tax too. But it amounts to less than 1% of the size of the economy. The big picture is several billion a year of extra spending, but not several tens of billions. Keep the so-called triple lock on the state pension. Keeping the popular ""triple lock"" means the state pension will be increased by the CPI measure of inflation, wage growth or 2.5% each year - whichever is the highest. Critics say that keeping it in place is unaffordable and that it doesn't help the poorest and oldest pensioners who are on the old state pension. But tampering with it would have been politically radical - all of the major parties have committed to it in this election. The Conservatives have learned from past mistakes. Theresa May pledged to scrap the 2.5% guarantee in the 2017 election, and was forced to abandon the pledge to win support from the DUP. This policy would apply to the whole of the UK. A cross-party consensus on care will be built. Boris Johnson promised tofix the crisis in adult social care, but the manifesto contains little more than the guiding principle that no-one will have to sell their home to pay for care. As things stand, few would call these details an ambitious plan, but the Conservatives' pledge to urgently build a cross-party consensus on future care will be welcomed. The system is already at breaking point, and experts warn the extra Â£1bn a year promised for the next five years won't be enough to prop it up. Not least, because the money will be shared with equally overstretched children's services. The Tory calculation appears to be that it is best to say as little as possible, rather than risk being tripped up by an issue that cost them dearly at the last election. Social care is devolved so this will only apply in England. Meet the pledge to cut emissions to virtually zero. Conservative climate policies will attract scrutiny. In June, they set aworld-leading goal of cutting emissions to virtually zero by 2050. And they've created a boom in cheap offshore wind energy. Butinterim emissions targets are already slipping away,external. What's more, some scientists are warning that the climate needs even more urgent repair. That led the Lib Dems and SNP to propose an earlier clean-up date of 2045. Labour says it should be by the 2030s. The Greens want 2030 - which would mean practically all petrol and diesel vehicles banned, all homes insulated and all central heating boilers changed within a decade. So, it's not just a question of the date - it's whether the policy can be delivered. Energy policy applies to the whole of the UK, as does policy relating to exports. What is a climate emergency?

Improve the energy efficiency of social housing. The UK's homes are so poorly insulated that to meet the country's 2050 climate commitments we need a nationwide programme to upgrade them. This pledge to spend Â£2,860 per household on improving the energy efficiency of social housing would affect 2.2m homes. But there's no mention of what would be done for those who own their own home. The claim that households could save up to Â£750 a year on their energy bills sounds optimistic and could only apply to homes with terrible energy efficiency. The typical saving after such work on housing, experts say, tends to be more like Â£50. The policy is dwarfed by Labour's promises of spending Â£9,300 per home on almost all of the 27 million homes in the UK, at a cost of Â£250bn. Housing is devolved so this will only apply to England. Fewer lower-skilled migrants will be allowed into the UK. The last Conservative manifesto reiterated the leadership's intention to reduce net migration to less than 100,000. It became an albatross - a much-criticised target that was never achieved.  Boris Johnson had already jettisoned it in favour of an Australian style points-based system, attracting ""the brightest and the best"". The focus on control means that fewer lower skilled migrants will be allowed into the UK. But while the Conservatives can argue this will mean less pressure on public services, it is these services which often rely on migrant labour. This policy applies to the whole of the UK. Reduce poverty through changes to tax and benefits. The Conservatives confirm they will continue the roll out of universal credit, despite the controversy that has dogged the new benefits system. As has already been announced they are ending the freeze on benefits, which will mean a 1.7% increase in the money people get next April. They also pledge to reduce the number of reassessments that people with disabilities face for their benefits, with a national strategy for disabled people promised by the end of 2020. There is a commitment to reduce poverty, including child poverty, through changes to tax and benefits. But there is little detail on how ongoing complaints about the failings of universal credit will be addressed. This policy applies to the whole of the UK. Help parents by making childcare available in the holidays. Labour and the Liberal Democrats are offering multi-billion pound, universal childcare policies for pre-school children. But for the Tories this is a much more strategic offer - aiming to create 250,000 extra childcare places during the holidays for primary school-age children - about 5% of that age group. It would cost Â£250m per year for three years, with Â£250m for one-off costs such as buildings. This recalls the era of former Labour prime minister Tony Blair, with its pre-austerity expansion of breakfast clubs, after-school clubs and holiday clubs. Much of this will be delivered through schools, so it will depend on them being able to make their premises available over the summer holidays. Childcare is devolved so will only apply to England. Freeze of tuition fees at Â£9,250 likely to continue. For most degree students and their universities there is little in this manifesto. Simply a promise to look carefully at the ""thoughtful"" suggestions in the review into student finance and university and college funding, led by Philip Augar. In the short term, this suggests the current freeze of tuition fees in England at their current level of Â£9,250 will continue. That could eventually have the same effect as the cut proposed by the Augar panel because of inflation. Interest rates on student loans are to be reviewed again. On lifelong learning, the offer is more modest than both the Lib Dems training wallet and Labour's promise of six years of free adult learning. Instead the manifesto says the Conservatives would work towards a right to retrain. Tuition fees and education are devolved, so any policy changes will apply to England only. And there's Â£2bn to fill potholes. It's telling that top of the Tories' transport list is a promise to build a new rail line linking Manchester and Leeds. It's a long-held and well-founded grievance in the north of England that transport infrastructure is substandard compared with the south. But the project isn't expected to be complete before 2040. The more immediate infrastructure conundrum is High Speed 2 which is already under way. Given how much that project polarises opinion it wasn't a surprise when a Conservative government said it would make a decision after the election. And by singling-out funding of Â£2bn for potholes and a further Â£29bn for roads, the Conservatives are more at ease than the other main parties in reaffirming their commitment to the car as a predominant mode of transport. In truth, on transport there are no huge policy surprises. It will look into the constitutional power balance. The Supreme Court's ruling in September - that Boris Johnson's advice to the Queen to prorogue (suspend) Parliament was unlawful - was the latest and most dramatic example of judicial review. There is now almost no area of government decision-making that cannot be subject to scrutiny by judges. Some feel it has pulled the judiciary too far into areas of political decision-making. The Conservatives' proposed ""constitution, democracy and rights"" commission is intended to look afresh at the constitutional power balance between the three great institutions of state, the executive (government and crown), Parliament and the judiciary.

"This video can not be played President Trump is on his best behaviour, but is everyone else? US President Donald Trump has called Justin Trudeau ""two-faced"" over a video in which the Canadian leader appears to mock him at a meeting of Nato leaders. Footage showed Mr Trudeau, UK PM Boris Johnson and French leader Emmanuel Macron discussing an impromptu press conference held by Mr Trump. Nato leaders agreed a statement of unity but the 70th anniversary meeting held near London also saw several rows. Mr Trump cancelled a press conference planned for after the summit. He told reporters: ""We'll go directly back. I think we've done plenty of news conferences."" The brief video posted on Twitter by Canada's public broadcaster, CBC, showed Mr Trudeau chatting with a group of leaders, including Mr Johnson, Mr Macron, Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, and Queen Elizabeth's daughter Princess Anne at Buckingham Palace. At the start of the footage, Mr Johnson asked Mr Macron: ""Is that why you were late?"" Mr Trudeau then interjects: ""He was late because he takes a 40-minute press conference off the top."" Five hot mics that got leaders in trouble Mr Macron then appears to tell an anecdote, but his words are drowned out by background noise. An amused Mr Trudeau then replies: ""Oh yeah, yeah, he announced... [inaudible]. You just watched his team's jaw drop to the floor."" None of them appeared to realise they were being recorded. This video can not be played Donald Trump says Justin Trudeau is ""two-faced"" - but Trudeau says they've a good relationship In response, Mr Trump said of Mr Trudeau: ""He's two-faced... I find him to be a nice guy, but the truth is I called him out on the fact that he's not paying 2% [of national GDP towards defence] and I guess he's not very happy about it. ""He's not paying 2% and he should be paying 2%. Canada - they have money. Look, I'm representing the US and he should be paying more than he's paying, he understands it... I can imagine he's not that happy but that's the way it is."" Asked about the video, Mr Johnson told reporters: ""It's complete nonsense. I don't know where that's come from."" Mr Trudeau later told reporters that they hadn't been laughing about Mr Trump's press conference, but about the location of the next G7 summit - Camp David, the US presidential country retreat. ""I have a very good relationship with Trump,"" he added. In the statement, Nato leaders said: ""To stay secure we must look to the future together."" It then acknowledged the ""challenges"" posed by China and Russia, and pledged to take ""stronger action"" against terrorism. This video can not be played Feuds reunited? The rifts behind Nato's big birthday Although the 29-member bloc's future is not in doubt, there are disagreements over Turkey's recent military action in northern Syria; the levels of military spending by members; and recent comments by Mr Macron that the alliance is ""brain dead"". Despite the divisions,Mr Johnson - the host of the event - described Nato as a ""giant shield of solidarity""that ""protects nearly a billion people"", saying at the start of the meeting at a luxury resort in Watford: ""As long as we stand together, no-one can hope to defeat us."" This video can not be played Boris Johnson tells fellow Nato leaders: ""Peace cannot be taken for granted"" Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg cited increased spending commitments on defence by European allies and Canada, saying: ""Nato is the most successful alliance in history because we've changed as the world has changed."" On Tuesday, he said those nations had added $130bn (Â£100bn) to defence budgets since 2016, and that this number would increase to $400bn by 2024. Mr Trump has frequently and forcefully criticised how much other allies spend on defence. The first day of the special anniversary summit saw tensions bubble to the surface, with Mr Trump and Mr Macronsparring over Nato's role, Turkey, and Islamic State group (IS) fightersduring a news conference. Relations between the two leaders were already strained amida dispute over taxes and trade, and comments from the French president last month that the US commitment to the alliance was fading. Troubled Nato not in party mood In pictures: 70 years of Nato What does the US do for Nato? Mr Trump, who once called Nato ""obsolete"", had earlier hit back by saying Mr Macron had been ""very disrespectful"" by describing Nato as ""brain dead"", calling them ""nasty"" comments. Mr Macron said he stood by his remarks. President Trump and Mr Johnson held unscheduled bilateral talks and, ahead of Wednesday's talks, Mr Trump tweeted they both had ""talked about numerous subjects including Nato and trade"". Nato, the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, started out in 1949 with just 12 countries as members but having now expanded to a bloc of 29, it is increasingly difficult for the alliance to project a united front. Nato estimates for 2019 show there are now eight countries - in addition to the US - meeting the target agreed by all members to spend 2% or more of their gross domestic product (GDP, a measure of economic output) on defence. Nato leaders attended a reception hosted by the Queen and Prince of Wales on Tuesday Before departing for London,Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan also said he would oppose a Nato defence planfor the Baltic region and Poland if the bloc did not support Turkey over its fight against Kurdish groups in Syria it considers terrorists. Mr Stoltenberg later told reporters that the alliance had been able to resolve the disagreement with Turkey, allowing Nato's plans to go ahead. The Queen talks to President Trump and his wife Melania during Tuesday's reception As well as the Turkish issue, talks had centred on the rising threats of China and Russia. After the summit, Mr Macron said that while Russia was a threat to Nato in some respects, in others the country could be a ""partner"". ""Around the table, would everyone recognise Russia as an enemy? I don't think that is the case,"" he told a news conference. ""On some topics Russia is seen as a threat, this is true... But Russia is also a partner in some issues. We're working and having concrete discussions with Russia on certain issues.""

"The bank said it would cut fees on unarranged overdrafts HSBC is to bring in a single overdraft rate of 39.9% for UK customers from March 2020, as much as quadrupling the rate it charges some customers. However, the bank is removing a Â£5 daily fee for going into an unarranged overdraft and introducing an interest-free Â£25 buffer on some accounts. It follows a similar move from Nationwide Building Society in July. The new annual rate comes in response to tough new rules from regulators designed to protect consumers. But one analyst warned that steep overdraft rates could now become the ""new normal"". HSBC UK currently charges rates of 9.9% to 19.9% on arranged overdrafts, but the higher rate will be applied across its whole range of accounts except for its student bank account. The Â£25 buffer will apply to Bank Accounts and Advance Bank Accounts, providing leeway for those going slightly overdrawn. Bank overdraft fees in major shake-up Nationwide customers refunded Â£6m in charges HSBC said that as a result of this and the removal of the Â£5 daily fee for unarranged overdrafts, seven in 10 who use an overdraft would be better off or the same as a result of the changes. But that suggests around a third could end up worse off. The bank has eight to nine million current account holders in the UK. Madhu Kejriwal, HSBC UK's head of lending and payments, said: ""By simplifying our overdraft charging structure we are making them easier to understand, more transparent and giving customers tools to help them make better financial decisions."" Nationwide has also raised its overdraft rates The move comes in response to Financial Conduct Authority's plans to shake up the ""dysfunctional"" overdraft market - including stopping banks and building societies from charging higher prices for unarranged overdrafts than for arranged overdrafts. The new rules, which come into force next April, will require providers to charge a simple annual interest rate on all overdrafts and get rid of fixed fees. But there have been concerns that banks will hike authorised overdraft charges to claw back some revenue lost from unauthorised overdraft fees. In July, Nationwide also unveiled a new single rate of 39.9% across its adult current account range. Its changes came into force in November. Helen Saxon, banking editor at MoneySavingExpert.com, said: ""With both of the first banks to announce changes moving overdraft interest rates to around 40%, we have to wonder if this is the new normal."" The FCA has acknowledged banks may look to increase their arranged overdraft prices as a result of the new rules. But it argues the net effect will still be better for consumers - and increased competition between providers as a result of the changes will constrain any price increases. Rachel Springall, a finance expert at Moneyfacts.co.uk, said: ""It's disappointing to see such a hike in overdraft charges but there may be more brands coming out in the coming weeks to announce changes too. ""This shake-up is designed to make things fairer and more transparent to consumers. ""Borrowers would be wise to scrutinise any changes to their current account and look to switch elsewhere if they find that the account has lost its shine.""

"Greetings card retailer Clintons has struck a deal that will stop it going bust this Christmas, administrators KPMG have said. The chain will be salvaged through a complex transaction that allows it to be sold back to its existing owners. It means Clinton's 334 stores can keep trading for now, saving 2,500 jobs. Boss Eddie Shepherd said he was pleased to have secured the firm's future ahead of the ""crucial"" Christmas trading period. ""Like so many of our fellow High Street retailers, we have worked tirelessly to contend with the maelstrom of issues impacting the sector, from business rates pressures, to fragile consumer confidence and the lack of clarity around the taxation of online retail businesses,"" he said. ""We are confident that this deal will kickstart a new chapter for our business."" Clintons had initially tried to find a new buyer for its ailing business, but it is thought no acceptable offers were received. Retailer Clintons in survival talks with landlords Peacocks set to rescue BonmarchÃ© from collapse It then explored a company voluntary arrangement (CVA) - a strategy that would have allowed it to shut under-performing stores and cut rents on others. But it was unable to get the support it needed from landlords. Instead the company has effectively bought itself out of administration. In what is known as a pre-pack process, the firm has removed its debt and secured breathing room to start negotiations with landlords afresh. However, there is no guarantee this will secure its long term future. Julie Palmer, a partner at Begbies Traynor, said Clintons had failed to adapt to changing consumer tastes, both online and on the High Street. ""It's a tough ask for Clintons but if it is to survive and thrive it will need to modernise and revitalise its brand. Otherwise this pre-pack could just be a stay of execution for a retailer that has been a mainstay of the High Street for years."" Clintons, previously known as Clinton Cards, was formed in 1968, and has been owned by the US-based Weiss family since 2012. It is the second time in seven years that the card retailer has been saved from administration. A string of retail chains in the UK have closed over the last few years amid a squeeze on consumer spending. News of Clintons' restructuring comes a month after baby goods retailer Mothercare announced its UK operation was going into administration, putting 2,500 jobs at risk. Others to have gone under include electronics retailer Maplin and discount chain Poundworld, while Homebase, Debenhams and Carpetright have all been forced to restructure.

Mr Johnson says yes - prompting a loud rebuke from Mr Peston of ""that's not true!"". The PM adds: ""What will happen is that the parliamentary agony will be over... the anguish will be over."" The Tories have said all of its parliamentary candidates support Mr Johnson's deal, but the PM says he has not ""forced"" prospective Conservative candidates to pledge their support. Asked by Robert Peston whether, for example, food standards are more important than a free-trade deal with the US, the PM does not agree or disagree but says ""we have massive opportunities and we need to seize them now"". Asked to name a deal that will happen as part of the ""tidal wave"" of investment post-Brexit, Mr Johnson claims Goldman Sachs says that there is Â£150bn riding on Britain leaving the EU. The PM adds that he doesn't wish to cite specific deals or people. Challenged by Robert Peston over his insistence that the UK is ""out of the EU"", the PM says the UK has chosen to have a transition period for the smoothness of business and that it was a choice that can be ended at any time. Mr Peston then confronts the PM with a printed version of his Brexit deal which he claims is 10% of the size of Theresa May's withdrawal agreement. Mr Johnson accuses the ITV journalist of being too pessimistic. Boris Johnson tells ITV's Robert Peston that getting Brexit done means more nurses in the NHS, more police officers, and moving the country forward. The PM says there is a ""tidal wave of investment"" ready to come into Britain once his Brexit deal is done.

"Investors in one of the UK's biggest commercial property funds - worth Â£2.5bn - have been temporarily prevented from taking out their money. Investment firm M&G said withdrawals from its property portfolio fund had been suspended after investors consistently withdrew their savings. The firm blamed ""Brexit-related political uncertainty"" and difficulties in the retail sector for the situation. The fund has shrunk by Â£1.1bn so far this year. ""Given these circumstances, we have now reached a point where M&G believes it will best protect the interests of the funds' customers by applying a temporary suspension in dealing,"" M&G said in a statement. It has waived 30% of its annual charge to investors, as they were unable to access their money, although some have called for action from the regulator on such charges. The M&G Property Portfolio has invested in 91 UK commercial properties across shopping centres, other retail, industrial and office sectors on behalf of UK investors. The same fundwas suspended in July 2016for four months following the UK's EU referendum when money flooded out of such funds. Investors range from armchair, retail investors to institutional investors, dealing with millions of pounds. M&G has been unable to sell properties fast enough, particularly given its concentration on the retail sector, to meet the demands of investors who wanted to cash out. The decision to suspend the fund, and its feeder fund, was taken by its official monitor - its authorised corporate director - and the City watchdog has been informed. ""The FCA is working closely with the firms involved to ensure that timely actions are undertaken in the best interests of all the fund's investors,"" a spokesman for the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said. M&G said the suspension would be monitored daily, formally reviewed every 28 days, and would only continue ""as long as it is in the best interests of our customers"". This will allow assets to be sold over time, rather than as a fire sale, in order to meet investors' withdrawal demands. The firm haswritten to investors,externalto explain the current situation. Investors in general have been shaken in recent months by the demise of previously lauded fund manager Neil Woodford. Woodford Investment Management is shutting after Mr Woodford was sacked from its flagship fund in October. The case raised questions regarding the oversight of funds which invest in assets that take a long time to sell, but from which investors can withdraw their money from at any time. The M&G case will make the case stronger for regulators to take a tougher stance on these types of investments. The spectacular fall of money manager Neil Woodford By Rob Young, business reporter The suspension of a UK commercial property fund has been anticipated for some time. The City watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority, has been on high alert, subjecting a number of funds to enhanced monitoring. One of the main issues affecting M&G has been the state of retail. The High Street has been having a torrid time. As more and more stores have closed, that has put pressure on property funds. Returns from these have been less than great recently and so many investors have been pulling out their cash. M&G admits it has been struggling to sell buildings with sufficient speed to be able to match the demand from investors wanting their cash back. Hence this suspension. Some analysts warn several other property funds could follow suit. When the M&G property portfolio last took this action, others did too. That was just after the EU referendum in 2016. As the UK approaches yet another Brexit deadline, it could become even more difficult for funds to sell commercial property at a value they think is fair. Investors have been pulling their money out of other large so-called open-ended property funds, and the FCA has recently introduced daily monitoring of property funds. Yet financial planners have mixed views on whether the M&G suspension could be matched by other funds in the sector. ""Property is a long-term investment and we urge investors not to panic,"" said Patrick Connolly of financial advisers Chase de Vere. ""While the M&G fund is suspended, most other providers have far greater liquidity, and less exposure to retail properties, and so are better placed to meet redemptions, as long as there isn't a mad rush to the exit door. ""Property still remains an asset class which can play an important role in investment portfolios and, when we have some real clarity on Brexit, the prospects for this asset class will hopefully improve."" However, Ryan Hughes, from AJ Bell, said investors would review their interest in other funds which could lead to ""a rush for the exits"". ""We could see a wave of suspensions now - several that offer daily redemptions are at risk,"" he said. A spokesman for Aviva, one of the other fund managers that suspended a fund in 2016, said it had ""pro-actively built cash levels in the Aviva Investors Property Fund"". These were now at around 30% after it made several sales over the summer. ""We are in a period of heightened market uncertainty and believe this is an appropriate level given market conditions. Robust liquidity management remains a key priority for the fund managers,"" he said.

"Greetings card retailer Clintons has struck a deal that will stop it going bust this Christmas, administrators KPMG have said. The chain will be salvaged through a complex transaction that allows it to be sold back to its existing owners. It means Clinton's 334 stores can keep trading for now, saving 2,500 jobs. Boss Eddie Shepherd said he was pleased to have secured the firm's future ahead of the ""crucial"" Christmas trading period. ""Like so many of our fellow High Street retailers, we have worked tirelessly to contend with the maelstrom of issues impacting the sector, from business rates pressures, to fragile consumer confidence and the lack of clarity around the taxation of online retail businesses,"" he said. ""We are confident that this deal will kickstart a new chapter for our business."" Clintons had initially tried to find a new buyer for its ailing business, but it is thought no acceptable offers were received. Retailer Clintons in survival talks with landlords Peacocks set to rescue BonmarchÃ© from collapse It then explored a company voluntary arrangement (CVA) - a strategy that would have allowed it to shut under-performing stores and cut rents on others. But it was unable to get the support it needed from landlords. Instead the company has effectively bought itself out of administration. In what is known as a pre-pack process, the firm has removed its debt and secured breathing room to start negotiations with landlords afresh. However, there is no guarantee this will secure its long term future. Julie Palmer, a partner at Begbies Traynor, said Clintons had failed to adapt to changing consumer tastes, both online and on the High Street. ""It's a tough ask for Clintons but if it is to survive and thrive it will need to modernise and revitalise its brand. Otherwise this pre-pack could just be a stay of execution for a retailer that has been a mainstay of the High Street for years."" Clintons, previously known as Clinton Cards, was formed in 1968, and has been owned by the US-based Weiss family since 2012. It is the second time in seven years that the card retailer has been saved from administration. A string of retail chains in the UK have closed over the last few years amid a squeeze on consumer spending. News of Clintons' restructuring comes a month after baby goods retailer Mothercare announced its UK operation was going into administration, putting 2,500 jobs at risk. Others to have gone under include electronics retailer Maplin and discount chain Poundworld, while Homebase, Debenhams and Carpetright have all been forced to restructure.

"This video can not be played NI Secretary Julian Smith confronted by healthcare workers over pay The crisis in Northern Ireland's health service is ""unacceptable"", NI Secretary Julian Smith has said, as industrial action by healthcare workers continues. Mr Smith was speaking during a visit to Belfast where he met members of the NI Civil Service and trade unions. He said he was ""extremely sorry"" that the strike was affecting patients, families and workers. Health workers are protesting at pay and staffing levels which they claim are ""unsafe"". The union, Unison, that represents more than 6,500 registered nurses and 3,500 health care assistants, has called for ""compromise and money on the table"". 'It feels like someone sawing into my hip' Northern Ireland has been without a devolved government since January 2017 when the power-sharing parties - the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in - split after a bitter row. Mr Smith said he would have more conversations both with the NI Civil Service and the unions over the coming days. Unison workers taking industrial action in Londonderry on Wednesday ""This area of health is a devolved matter so the decisions have to be taken by the NI Civil Service, they are working in difficult circumstances because Stormont's not running. ""But I am working with them to see if we can find a way through."" He added that the situation was ""unacceptable"" and that he would ""do whatever I can within the powers I have to help the NI Civil Service move this forward"". However, when asked about the possibility of extra money for the civil service to deal with the ongoing healthcare issues, Mr Smith maintained that the negotiations on health service issues would be led by the civil service. His comments come as industrial action continues to affect the health service. At the Ulster Hospital, routine afternoon outpatient appointments, with the exception of maternity and children's, have been cancelled. Patients in the South Eastern Trust area who have not received a letter of cancellation should attend as normal for their appointments. In the Western Trust area, strike action by support services staff is expected to affect hospitals, day centres and residential homes. Full details and advice on current health care services can be found on theHealth and Social Care Board website,external. Dr Michael McBride, Northern Ireland's chief medical officer, has warned that there is a ""real risk"" of unintended consequences if industrial action continues. Dr Michael McBride stressed that he respected the workers' right to take action Speaking on BBC NI's Nolan Show, Dr McBride said the situation was ""very concerning"" given the fragile nature of Northern Ireland's health system. He said that the scale and scope of industrial action at a time of significant pressure on the service meant that ""the risk of unintended consequences is real"". He said he feared what these consequences might be, but stressed he also respected workers' rights. ""Front-line health and social care staff have genuine grievances and I absolutely accept the rights of those individuals to take industrial action,"" he said. ""Who wouldn't want hard working staff, totally dedicated and committed staff who are the backbone of our health service to get a fair day's pay, to have pay which is comparable to other parts of the United Kingdom?"" Dr McBride repeated his appeal to all in the dispute to pause, take a step back and work to unlock the impasse. Among those taking industrial action in Derry is Stephen Ward, a porter at Altnagelvin Hospital. He said staff were ""at breaking point"". Mr Ward said staff were not being rewarded for the work they carried out ""We are running around 24/7 after cardiac arrests and people with serious haemorrhages. ""There's so much to the role that keeps the place functioning and we are not getting rewarded for it,"" he said. ""We are basically on minimum wage and you can't live the best quality of life that you should. ""We are at breaking point and I think we should go into direct rule as soon as possible. It's emotional because we are always thinking about the patients."" Unison nurses started taking action short of strike from Monday. Speaking on BBC NI's Good Morning Ulster, Anne Speed of Unison welcomed the decision by the health trusts' chief executives to speak out in a joint statement. ""I was glad to hear that they didn't blame workers,"" she said. ""They have pointed in the direction of those who have access to money and those who can influence those who have access to money. That direction needs to be continued and the chief executives need to continue calling for that."" Ms Speed said that, so far, those who can offer compromise do not have access to money. Anne Speed, Unison, called for compromise and 'money on the table' She said the basis on which the Department of Health had looked for a resolution of the dispute was insufficient at this stage. Ms Speed said Unison was not walking away from its responsibilities and was working to manage risk. She said the planned complete withdrawal of labour by nurses on 18 December would be ""very serious"". ""When nurses remove themselves from routine nursing care it will be a very big wake-up call for everybody with anything to do with the health service, especially those in the leadership,"" she said. On Tuesday, nurses from the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) took actionshort of strikeby refusing to do any work not directly related to patient care. Members of the RCN took industrial action on Tuesday The UK government said that as health is a devolved matter, only a restored Stormont executive could take decisions on the health service. In a statement, the Northern Ireland Office said that while Julian Smith had further discussions with the NI Civil Service on Tuesday, he ""has no powers to direct them or take decisions on health matters"". Two more days of industrial action, short of strike action, are to be held on 10 and 11 December. Members of the RCN and trade unions Unite, Unison and NIPSA have voted to strike on 18 December.

"Defendants (L-R) Nazam Akhtar, Mohammad Rizwan, Mohammed Ali Sultan, Amjad Hussain and Shafiq Younas deny wrongdoing A woman who was allegedly sold for sex as a girl and abused has told a court no action was taken by teachers when rumours of it circulated at her school. Giving evidence behind a curtain, she said they did not ask ""if things were all right"" when they heard rumours. The woman told Birmingham Crown Court she was traded to men in Telford for sex in the early 2000s. Mohammed Ali Sultan, Amjad Hussain, Shafiq Younas, Nazam Akhtar and Mohammad Rizwan deny wrongdoing. ""I would get called names,"" she said, after rumours spread at school that she was having sex with men.

Prosecutors said she was repeatedly raped on a dirty mattress above a takeaway and forced to perform sex acts in a churchyard. At school, ""there used to be like actions, with their hand, hand by their mouth"" suggesting sex acts she said, which ""just made me keep it to myself even more"".

"Otis with parents Donna (left) and Jasmine Francis-Smith (right) A couple have given birth to a son from an embryo that was in both their wombs, in what is claimed to be a world first. Jasmine Francis-Smith gave birth to Otis two months ago after the embryo was implanted that had first been incubated by her wife Donna. The ""shared motherhood"" procedure at London Women's Clinic used technology from a Swiss fertility company. Jasmine said: ""It has emotionally brought us closer together. We are a true family."" The procedure works by placing the eggs of the biological mother inside a miniature capsule which is inserted into her womb, where they are incubated. After that, the eggs are taken out of the biological mother's womb and placed in the womb of the birth mother. The process, called In Vivo Natural fertilization, was pioneered by Swiss firm Anecova. Otis was born after a ""world first"" procedure in London Jasmine, 28, from Northamptonshire, said: ""The whole process was an amazing experience and we got everything we wanted from it."" She explained the procedure made her and her wife Donna, 30, from Nottinghamshire, ""feel equal in the whole process"". Jasmine, who lives with Donna in Colchester, Essex, said ""there is nothing we would change"" about the pregnancy and the birth of Otis. Dr Kamal Ahuja, managing and scientific director of London Women's Clinic, said this was ""the first birth in the world with shared motherhood"" using the technology.

"The term ""Balsamic Vinegar from Modena"" has been protected since 2009 The EU's top court has thrown out an attempt by vinegar makers in Italy's Modena province to stop competitors from using the term ""balsamic"". The producers had argued that each term in the description ""Balsamic Vinegar from Modena"" was theirs to use exclusively under EU rules. The phrase has been protected as a ""geographical indication"" since 2009. But the European Court of Justice said this did not mean exclusive use of the word ""balsamic"". Geographical indications (GIs) are used by the EU to protect food and drinks ""whose quality, reputation or other such characteristics relate to its geographical origin."" It says it does so to protect products against ""misuse or imitation"". You can't copyright taste, top court rules Scotch whisky and salmon 'must keep EU-style status' 'Major worries' for Welsh foods after Brexit Does your sausage need protection? Modena, in northern Italy, is famous for its balsamic vinegar. It is made from specific varieties of grape which are aged in wooden barrels for several years. But the European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruled on Wednesday that protection of the name ""Aceto Balsamico di Modena"" (Balsamic Vinegar from Modena) ""does not extend to the use of the individual non-geographical terms of that name"". ""The term 'aceto' [vinegar] is a common term and the term 'balsamico' [balsamic] is an adjective that is commonly used to refer to a vinegar with a bitter-sweet flavour,"" it said. The producers in Modena launched the case after a vinegar manufacturer in Germany marketed its vinegar-based products with the names ""Balsamico"" and ""Deutscher Balsamico"" (German Balsamic). The case went before a German court, which then asked the ECJ for clarification. The court noted that the terms also appeared in another protected designation from a neighbouring province in Italy - ""Aceto balsamico tradizionale di Reggio Emilia"" (Traditional Balsamic Vinegar from Reggio Emilia).

"Otis with parents Donna (left) and Jasmine Francis-Smith (right) A couple have given birth to a son from an embryo that was in both their wombs, in what is claimed to be a world first. Jasmine Francis-Smith gave birth to Otis two months ago after the embryo was implanted that had first been incubated by her wife Donna. The ""shared motherhood"" procedure at London Women's Clinic used technology from a Swiss fertility company. Jasmine said: ""It has emotionally brought us closer together. We are a true family."" The procedure works by placing the eggs of the biological mother inside a miniature capsule which is inserted into her womb, where they are incubated. After that, the eggs are taken out of the biological mother's womb and placed in the womb of the birth mother. The process, called In Vivo Natural fertilization, was pioneered by Swiss firm Anecova. Otis was born after a ""world first"" procedure in London Jasmine, 28, from Northamptonshire, said: ""The whole process was an amazing experience and we got everything we wanted from it."" She explained the procedure made her and her wife Donna, 30, from Nottinghamshire, ""feel equal in the whole process"". Jasmine, who lives with Donna in Colchester, Essex, said ""there is nothing we would change"" about the pregnancy and the birth of Otis. Dr Kamal Ahuja, managing and scientific director of London Women's Clinic, said this was ""the first birth in the world with shared motherhood"" using the technology.

"Defendants (L-R) Nazam Akhtar, Mohammad Rizwan, Mohammed Ali Sultan, Amjad Hussain and Shafiq Younas deny wrongdoing A woman who was allegedly sold for sex as a girl and abused has told a court no action was taken by teachers when rumours of it circulated at her school. Giving evidence behind a curtain, she said they did not ask ""if things were all right"" when they heard rumours. The woman told Birmingham Crown Court she was traded to men in Telford for sex in the early 2000s. Mohammed Ali Sultan, Amjad Hussain, Shafiq Younas, Nazam Akhtar and Mohammad Rizwan deny wrongdoing. ""I would get called names,"" she said, after rumours spread at school that she was having sex with men. Some of the assaults were carried out in Wellington, Telford, the prosecution claims The trial previously heard how she had ""lost count"" of how many men she was forced to have sex with after being groomed when she was 12 and then sold for sex. Prosecutors said she was repeatedly raped on a dirty mattress above a takeaway and forced to perform sex acts in a churchyard. At school, ""there used to be like actions, with their hand, hand by their mouth"" suggesting sex acts she said, which ""just made me keep it to myself even more"". ""Teachers heard people saying these things and not one teacher pulled me to the side and asked me if things were all right."" Latest news from the West Midlands Abused girl 'passed around like meat' She said she came forward after recognising images of two alleged attackers, including Mr Ali Sultan, in reports about the Telford sex ring during Operation Chalice. The jury heard that Mr Ali Sultan has previous convictions for similar offences against young girls, and the girl claimed he threatened her into keeping quiet. ""He knows what he did,"" she said, when challenged by his defence, ""and I know"". Mr Sultan, 33, formerly from Telford, faces four charges of indecent assault and one of rape. The jury was told he already had convictions for ""similar offences against young girls"". Mr Hussain, 38, of Acacia Drive, Leegomery, is accused of forcing the victim to perform oral sex on two occasions. Mr Younas, 35, of Regent Street, Wellington, is accused of the same offence, said to have taken place in the same churchyard. Mr Akhtar, 35, of Victoria Avenue, Wellington is accused of raping the girl in a lane, alongside Mr Sultan and Mr Hussain, and is also said to have urinated on her in an act of humiliation. Mr Rizwan, 37, of Mafeking Road, Telford, faces two charges of indecent assault. The trial continues.

"UUP leader Steve Aiken (bottom centre) was speaking at the party's election manifesto launch The Ulster Unionist Party wants a hung parliament so its MPs can ""exert their influence"" and stop Boris Johnson's Brexit deal, its leader has said. Steve Aiken was speaking as he launched the UUP's general election manifesto. He said the party wants ""to see Parliament come back in such a way that neither (Conservatives or Labour) has an opportunity to form a government"". He added this would make any UUP MPs ""very influential"" in ensuring Mr Johnson's deal is taken off the table. A simple guide to the 2019 NI general election General Election 2019: Northern Ireland candidates Nearly quarter of million apply to vote in NI The UUP backed Remain in the 2016 EU referendum but, after the result, said the decision to leave should ""be respected"" and that Northern Ireland should exit the EU on the same basis as the rest of the UK. However, the party has rejected the Brexit deal negotiated by Mr Johnson and claimed it creates ""a border down the Irish Sea"", meaning Northern Ireland would become ""a place apart"". Launching the manifesto, Mr Aiken described the decision to leave the EU as ""the biggest political earthquake"" the UK has experienced since World War Two. He added that, faced with Mr Johnson's deal, the party would prefer to remain in the EU than leave under his agreement. Referring to the deal, Mr Aiken said: ""Northern Ireland will be torn away from its most important economic market - Great Britain."" The new UUP leader also said ""no unionist could support Boris Johnson going forward"" and criticised Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn, describing him as ""unfit to be prime minister"". The party is standing in 16 seats across Northern Ireland, but is not running candidates in West Belfast or North Belfast. In the latter, the UUP stepped aside to support Nigel Dodds from the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP). The decision to step down came after a U-turn by the party leadership - originally Mr Aiken said the UUP would stand, leading tothreats being issued against party staff. The DUP has stepped aside in Fermanagh and South Tyrone to support UUP candidate Tom Elliott. Mr Elliott, a former party leader, lost his seat in the 2017 general election along with the party's other MP Danny Kinahan. The manifesto, entitled ""Northern Ireland Needs Change - Let's Change Together"", was launched at a Belfast hotel in front of journalists, candidates and party members. The party's programme includes a wide range of pledges including: Introduction of direct rule if there is no deal for a return of power-sharing at Stormont by mid-January Lowering of the voting age to 16 Declaration of a healthcare emergency in Northern Ireland Promise to never support the proposed Historical Investigations Unit Support for a new Environmental Protection Act Support for free TV licences for over 75s Support for a single state education system This is Steve Aiken's first election as leader after hetook over the party reigns in Octoberfollowing the resignation of Robin Swann.

"This video can not be played Jo Swinson on austerity vote: âI am sorry - it was not the right policy and we should have stopped it.â Jo Swinson has apologised for voting to cut benefits while serving in government with the Conservatives. The Liberal Democrat leader told the BBC's Andrew Neil her party had been wrong to back the so-called bedroom tax in the coalition government and ""we should have stopped it"". Although some cuts were needed when her party came into office in 2010, she suggested austerity had gone too far. Her party was committed to spend more on welfare and childcare, she added. During the 30-minute interview, Ms Swinson said she was determined to stop Brexit by whatever means possible, including working with other parties in the event of another hung Parliament to try and get another referendum. But she conceded the Lib Dems were unlikely to form the next government and be in a position to fulfil their campaign pledge to revoke Article 50 - the legal process for leaving the EU - without a further public vote. She said she disagreed with her predecessor Sir Vince Cable that the pledge had become an ""unhelpful distraction"" for the party, which has found itself being squeezed in the opinion polls during the campaign. Having only been elected leader in July, she insisted she was ""absolutely here to stay"" whatever the outcome on 12 December. Live: Latest from the campaign trail The 12 key policies in the Lib Dem manifesto Ms Swinson was repeatedly challenged on her party's record in government between 2010 and 2015 and her personal backing for cuts to benefits and Sure Start children's centres. She acknowledged she had voted nine times for the bedroom tax, the controversial policy which saw working-age families in council or housing association homes docked housing benefit if they were deemed to have more bedrooms than they needed. Ms Swinson, who served as a junior business minister in the Lib Dem/Conservative coalition between 2012 and 2015, was asked whether she would like to apologise to 240,000 of the poorest in society who suffered financially as a result and, in some cases, were forced into hardship. ""Yes, I am sorry I did that,"" she replied. ""It was not the right policy and we should have stopped it...I have previously said - and I am happy to say again - [it] was wrong. I am sorry about that and it is one of the things we did get wrong."" Asked about other welfare changes she backed at the time but is now committed to reversing, such as a cap on the overall amount of benefits a single household could receive, she said she had voted for them ""as someone with collective responsibility in government"". She said her party had ""won many battles"" with the Conservatives, such as in securing more money for children from disadvantaged backgrounds and taking many of the lowest paid out of income tax. But she said she accepted the public services had borne too much of the brunt of the government's drive to slash the deficit in the public finances. The coalition government made a priority out of rebalancing the public finances ""I am not going to say in a financial crisis that it was going to be possible with the deficit at the level it was in 2010 not to make any cuts at all,"" she said. ""Some cuts were necessary but the shape of those cuts, the balance between cuts and tax rises I don't think was the right balance."" Labour have long argued that austerity was a political choice and not a financial necessity. Ms Swinson said cuts were unavoidable and the level of retrenchment under the coalition mirrored the plans set out by Labour in its 2010 manifesto, How do election spending plans compare? Lib Dems warn of student mental health 'crisis' But pressed by Neil on whether austerity was a ""necessary evil or terrible mistake"", she replied: ""Clearly too much was cut, clearly not enough was raised from taxation. ""And certainly the investment should have kicked in earlier in terms of more borrowing for capital investment."" But she said these decisions were ""almost a decade ago"" and her party was now committed to scrapping the bedroom tax and addressing in-work poverty by reversing cuts to work allowances for families on Universal Credit and helping families with two earners. She said the Â£14bn the party was planning to spend on expanding free childcare - by funding 35 hours a week of provision for all children aged two to four - ""more than replaces the money that was cut"" during the coalition years. ""We have a plan for the future which identifies what our priorities are...and we are being upfront about where the money will come from."" In a special series of election interviews, Neil has already questioned Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and the SNP's Nicola Sturgeon, His interview with Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage will be broadcast on Thursday. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has yet to agree a date to taking part, which has prompted a political row and accusations from Labour that he is ""running scared"". The SNP launched an attack on Ms Swinson's record as part of the coalition government, following the interview. The party's Pete Wishart said: ""Despite Jo Swinson's best attempts to dodge her shameful record when in government with the Tories, the reality is communities across Scotland will not forgive or forget the Lib Dems for their active part in inflicting austerity on the most vulnerable people in society.""

"Investors in one of the UK's biggest commercial property funds - worth Â£2.5bn - have been temporarily prevented from taking out their money. Investment firm M&G said withdrawals from its property portfolio fund had been suspended after investors consistently withdrew their savings. The firm blamed ""Brexit-related political uncertainty"" and difficulties in the retail sector for the situation. The fund has shrunk by Â£1.1bn so far this year. ""Given these circumstances, we have now reached a point where M&G believes it will best protect the interests of the funds' customers by applying a temporary suspension in dealing,"" M&G said in a statement. It has waived 30% of its annual charge to investors, as they were unable to access their money, although some have called for action from the regulator on such charges. The M&G Property Portfolio has invested in 91 UK commercial properties across shopping centres, other retail, industrial and office sectors on behalf of UK investors. The same fundwas suspended in July 2016for four months following the UK's EU referendum when money flooded out of such funds. Investors range from armchair, retail investors to institutional investors, dealing with millions of pounds. M&G has been unable to sell properties fast enough, particularly given its concentration on the retail sector, to meet the demands of investors who wanted to cash out. The decision to suspend the fund, and its feeder fund, was taken by its official monitor - its authorised corporate director - and the City watchdog has been informed. ""The FCA is working closely with the firms involved to ensure that timely actions are undertaken in the best interests of all the fund's investors,"" a spokesman for the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said. M&G said the suspension would be monitored daily, formally reviewed every 28 days, and would only continue ""as long as it is in the best interests of our customers"". This will allow assets to be sold over time, rather than as a fire sale, in order to meet investors' withdrawal demands. The firm haswritten to investors,externalto explain the current situation. Investors in general have been shaken in recent months by the demise of previously lauded fund manager Neil Woodford. Woodford Investment Management is shutting after Mr Woodford was sacked from its flagship fund in October. The case raised questions regarding the oversight of funds which invest in assets that take a long time to sell, but from which investors can withdraw their money from at any time. The M&G case will make the case stronger for regulators to take a tougher stance on these types of investments. The spectacular fall of money manager Neil Woodford By Rob Young, business reporter The suspension of a UK commercial property fund has been anticipated for some time. The City watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority, has been on high alert, subjecting a number of funds to enhanced monitoring. One of the main issues affecting M&G has been the state of retail. The High Street has been having a torrid time. As more and more stores have closed, that has put pressure on property funds. Returns from these have been less than great recently and so many investors have been pulling out their cash. M&G admits it has been struggling to sell buildings with sufficient speed to be able to match the demand from investors wanting their cash back. Hence this suspension. Some analysts warn several other property funds could follow suit. When the M&G property portfolio last took this action, others did too. That was just after the EU referendum in 2016. As the UK approaches yet another Brexit deadline, it could become even more difficult for funds to sell commercial property at a value they think is fair. Investors have been pulling their money out of other large so-called open-ended property funds, and the FCA has recently introduced daily monitoring of property funds. Yet financial planners have mixed views on whether the M&G suspension could be matched by other funds in the sector. ""Property is a long-term investment and we urge investors not to panic,"" said Patrick Connolly of financial advisers Chase de Vere. ""While the M&G fund is suspended, most other providers have far greater liquidity, and less exposure to retail properties, and so are better placed to meet redemptions, as long as there isn't a mad rush to the exit door. ""Property still remains an asset class which can play an important role in investment portfolios and, when we have some real clarity on Brexit, the prospects for this asset class will hopefully improve."" However, Ryan Hughes, from AJ Bell, said investors would review their interest in other funds which could lead to ""a rush for the exits"". ""We could see a wave of suspensions now - several that offer daily redemptions are at risk,"" he said. A spokesman for Aviva, one of the other fund managers that suspended a fund in 2016, said it had ""pro-actively built cash levels in the Aviva Investors Property Fund"". These were now at around 30% after it made several sales over the summer. ""We are in a period of heightened market uncertainty and believe this is an appropriate level given market conditions. Robust liquidity management remains a key priority for the fund managers,"" he said.

"No Time To Die marks Daniel Craig's swansong as James Bond And we thought Christmas only came once a year. The first full-length trailer for No Time To Diehas been released,external, giving fans a flavour of what to expect from Daniel Craig's final outing as James Bond. The promo, which launched on Wednesday and can be seen below, shows Rami Malek in character as the latest villain for the first time, as well as a new female agent with a licence to kill. No Time To Die is set to be released in April, but there have been one or two obstacles along the way - from Daniel Craig's ankle injury to the decision to change director. Danny Boyle was originally supposed to be at the helm for Bond 25, buthe exited the project last Augustdue to ""creative differences"". US director Cary Joji Fukunaga stepped in, and there was a race against the clock to keep the film on schedule for its April 2020 release date. ""It has been an incredible honour, but it's also just been really hard,"" Fukunaga tells BBC News. ""This was a very ambitious script for the time we had. Cary Joji Fukunaga stepped in to direct Daniel Craig's final outing as James Bond ""I got the role in the middle of doing press for Maniac[the Netflix series he directed], so I was doing interviews like this while trying to process the enormous excitement but also responsibility of taking on this project. ""And I was very aware that with Daniel's departure, I had to get a script going and production going in a very short space of time. The lack of time was a sort of impetus for the pressure. It was like a very hot flame under our ass!"" The project had the added complication of having to go back to the drawing board after Boyle's exit. ""I love Danny's films, but on this one we basically had to start from scratch,"" Fukunaga explains. ""It was the desire of the producers that we sort of start anew and figure out a new storyline for this one."" The writing process involvedbringing Fleabag creator Phoebe Waller-Bridge on boardto help polish the script. Allow YouTube content? This article contains content provided by Google YouTube.

Rami Malek is seen in character for the first time. Briefly.He's in the trailer for about two seconds in total. To be fair he's technically seen in other parts of it too but is hiding behind a white mask. Daniel Craig literally jumps off a bridge at one point.Seemingly without a harness or parachute. The camera follows him over the edge as he plunges through the air. Fortunately there's a secure piece of rope for him to grab on to, which is a nice stroke of luck. There's a new (female) agent in town with a licence to kill.""Are you a double-O?"" James Bond asks her. ""Two years,"" replies Lashana Lynch, which presumably means ""Yes I am thank you for asking."" But there are some familiar faces too.Christoph Waltz is back, havingnotbeen shot by Bond on Westminster Bridge at the end of Spectre. Jeffrey Wright's Felix makes an appearance in the trailer too, along with Bond's previous love interest Dr Madeleine Swann (LÃ©a Seydoux), Q (Ben Whishaw), M (Ralph Fiennes) and Moneypenny (Naomie Harris). Malek's villain might be Dr. No.Speculation was rifeafter fans noticed,externalthat neither the trailer nor the poster showed the character's hands. Could one of the franchise's most famous villains be revealed as the final member of the criminal network, Spectre? Fukunaga refers to a new plot, but No Time To Die also appears to continue the overarching storyline which has run through the last four films. Spectre's ending seemed to tie that narrative up, which left many wondering whether the 25th Bond film would start afresh. But the inclusion of Waltz's Blofeld in the trailer puts paid to that idea and suggests it's a continuation - something Fukunaga appears to confirm. Lashana Lynch plays a new MI6 agent with a licence to kill ""I like to think of this as picking up from all the stories, from Casino [Royale] all the way through,"" he says. ""And those who are fans will appreciate the layers that exist there, but I also think for new audiences, people who have never seen any of the films before, younger audiences, it's strong enough that they can get involved."" As well as Maniac, Fukunaga has previously directed films including Beasts of No Nation and a 2011 adaptation of Jane Eyre starring Mia Wasikowska. Perhaps the most interesting part of the trailer is Lashana Lynch's appearance as a new member of MI6. Having a female double-O marks a slight change in direction in the franchise. No Time To Die is the first Bond film since #MeToo, but would the film series have evolved in this direction anyway? ""Yes, I think so,"" Fukunaga says. ""Bond started evolving probably 25 years ago, when Judi Dench's M called out Pierce Brosnan's Bond for being a misogynistic dinosaur and a relic of the Cold War."" (He's quoting, almost verbatim, fromone of the first scenes Dench and Brosnan shared,externalin 1995's GoldenEye.) ""I think Lashana's role is not about being female, she's just a younger generation,"" Fukunaga says. ""There's the whole thing going around the internet right now about'OK Boomer', and I just think of how younger generations challenge what the previous generations legacy means. Fans have speculated about whether Rami Malek's villain is Dr No ""And I think for Lashana, she has a lot to prove, she's capable, she's physical, she's intelligent. And the world has changed, and she feels she's inheriting a world that agents like Bond had operated in. And it's like, they want to make their mark. That's how I think of it. Less so than just because she's female, we're in a world where that's not even the considerations. It's more, 'is she capable of being a double-O?'"" One person who became (temporarily) incapable of being a double-O wasDaniel Craig, who injured his anklewhile shooting the film. But, Fukunaga says, that wasn't as disruptive to the schedule as you might imagine. ""If you think about a film this ambitious, this long, with this many stunts, the fact that we had one sprained ankle and a concussion over that period of time was a pretty high achievement,"" he says. ""[Craig's ankle injury] delayed us a little bit, but he didn't miss a day of being on set after that. He was on set working out and doing PT [physical therapy] the entire time. We had to do a little juggling on schedule and scenes, but that was pretty much it."" No Time To Die isn't actually finished yet. Filming wrapped last month but the movie is now in post-production, which means Fukunaga ""still hasn't had time to really process"" the whole experience. ""I think I'll probably have to sit down next summer and figure out what just happened,"" he says. Ask the directors ofCatsorSonic The Hedgehogwhether launching a trailer is a positive experience and you might find them cowering in the corner of a room from the trauma. But Fukunaga is less anxious about the social media reaction to the Bond trailer. ""We don't have any computer graphics animals in our trailer,"" he laughs, ""so we're less worried about that.""

"A Christmas advert from exercise bike company Peloton has been widely mocked on social media as being ""sexist"", ""out of touch"", and even ""dystopian"". The ad, which has been viewed more than a million times on YouTube, sees a woman receive an exercise bike for Christmas from her husband. She then records her workouts over the following year in a vlog and presents it to him as a way of saying thank you. ""A year ago, I didn't realise how much this would change me,"" she says. The criticism knocked the company's shares, which closed more than 9% lower on Tuesday. Peloton sells fitness equipment - with bikes priced at more than $2,000 - fitted with touchscreens. Users then purchase a subscription to access classes streamed live and on-demand. The New York-based company released the ad,externalin November, but criticism on social media has increased markedly in recent days. Allow YouTube content?

Some people complained it is sexist for a man to give his wife an exercise bike for Christmas, as it suggested he wanted her to lose weight.

Peloton: 'It's borderline addiction' Exercise start-up Peloton gears up for stock debut Some also said the ad had a dystopian vibe and compared it to a horror film.

"This video can not be played NI Secretary Julian Smith confronted by healthcare workers over pay The crisis in Northern Ireland's health service is ""unacceptable"", NI Secretary Julian Smith has said, as industrial action by healthcare workers continues. Mr Smith was speaking during a visit to Belfast where he met members of the NI Civil Service and trade unions. He said he was ""extremely sorry"" that the strike was affecting patients, families and workers. Health workers are protesting at pay and staffing levels which they claim are ""unsafe"". The union, Unison, that represents more than 6,500 registered nurses and 3,500 health care assistants, has called for ""compromise and money on the table"". 'It feels like someone sawing into my hip' Northern Ireland has been without a devolved government since January 2017 when the power-sharing parties - the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in - split after a bitter row. Mr Smith said he would have more conversations both with the NI Civil Service and the unions over the coming days. Unison workers taking industrial action in Londonderry on Wednesday ""This area of health is a devolved matter so the decisions have to be taken by the NI Civil Service, they are working in difficult circumstances because Stormont's not running. ""But I am working with them to see if we can find a way through."" He added that the situation was ""unacceptable"" and that he would ""do whatever I can within the powers I have to help the NI Civil Service move this forward"". However, when asked about the possibility of extra money for the civil service to deal with the ongoing healthcare issues, Mr Smith maintained that the negotiations on health service issues would be led by the civil service. His comments come as industrial action continues to affect the health service. At the Ulster Hospital, routine afternoon outpatient appointments, with the exception of maternity and children's, have been cancelled. Patients in the South Eastern Trust area who have not received a letter of cancellation should attend as normal for their appointments. In the Western Trust area, strike action by support services staff is expected to affect hospitals, day centres and residential homes. Full details and advice on current health care services can be found on theHealth and Social Care Board website,external. Dr Michael McBride, Northern Ireland's chief medical officer, has warned that there is a ""real risk"" of unintended consequences if industrial action continues. Dr Michael McBride stressed that he respected the workers' right to take action Speaking on BBC NI's Nolan Show, Dr McBride said the situation was ""very concerning"" given the fragile nature of Northern Ireland's health system. He said that the scale and scope of industrial action at a time of significant pressure on the service meant that ""the risk of unintended consequences is real"". He said he feared what these consequences might be, but stressed he also respected workers' rights. ""Front-line health and social care staff have genuine grievances and I absolutely accept the rights of those individuals to take industrial action,"" he said. ""Who wouldn't want hard working staff, totally dedicated and committed staff who are the backbone of our health service to get a fair day's pay, to have pay which is comparable to other parts of the United Kingdom?"" Dr McBride repeated his appeal to all in the dispute to pause, take a step back and work to unlock the impasse. Among those taking industrial action in Derry is Stephen Ward, a porter at Altnagelvin Hospital. He said staff were ""at breaking point"". Mr Ward said staff were not being rewarded for the work they carried out ""We are running around 24/7 after cardiac arrests and people with serious haemorrhages. ""There's so much to the role that keeps the place functioning and we are not getting rewarded for it,"" he said. ""We are basically on minimum wage and you can't live the best quality of life that you should. ""We are at breaking point and I think we should go into direct rule as soon as possible. It's emotional because we are always thinking about the patients."" Unison nurses started taking action short of strike from Monday. Speaking on BBC NI's Good Morning Ulster, Anne Speed of Unison welcomed the decision by the health trusts' chief executives to speak out in a joint statement. ""I was glad to hear that they didn't blame workers,"" she said. ""They have pointed in the direction of those who have access to money and those who can influence those who have access to money. That direction needs to be continued and the chief executives need to continue calling for that."" Ms Speed said that, so far, those who can offer compromise do not have access to money. Anne Speed, Unison, called for compromise and 'money on the table' She said the basis on which the Department of Health had looked for a resolution of the dispute was insufficient at this stage. Ms Speed said Unison was not walking away from its responsibilities and was working to manage risk. She said the planned complete withdrawal of labour by nurses on 18 December would be ""very serious"". ""When nurses remove themselves from routine nursing care it will be a very big wake-up call for everybody with anything to do with the health service, especially those in the leadership,"" she said. On Tuesday, nurses from the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) took actionshort of strikeby refusing to do any work not directly related to patient care. Members of the RCN took industrial action on Tuesday The UK government said that as health is a devolved matter, only a restored Stormont executive could take decisions on the health service. In a statement, the Northern Ireland Office said that while Julian Smith had further discussions with the NI Civil Service on Tuesday, he ""has no powers to direct them or take decisions on health matters"". Two more days of industrial action, short of strike action, are to be held on 10 and 11 December. Members of the RCN and trade unions Unite, Unison and NIPSA have voted to strike on 18 December.

"This video can not be played Watch the UK prime minister's message to fellow Nato leaders earlier Boris Johnson has hailed Nato as ""the most successful alliance in history"" after talks with leaders near London. The PM insisted there was ""very great solidarity"" within the alliance, amid tensions on its 70th anniversary. He also praised the role of the United States, adding the country had been a ""pillar of stability"" on security issues. Jeremy Corbyn said he wanted to ensure Nato focused on reducing ""tensions around the world"". Leaders of the 29-member military alliance have been discussing shared security issues at a special meeting to mark 70 years since its formation. In a statement issued after talks at a luxury resort near Watford, leaders acknowledged the ""challenges"" posed by China and Russia, and pledged to take ""stronger action"" against terrorism. Trump on UK election: 'I can work with any PM' Nato leaders to meet as alliance's cracks show On Tuesday, Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said countries in the alliance had added $130bn (Â£100bn) to defence budgets since 2016, and that this number would increase to $400bn by 2024. US President Donald Trump has frequently criticised how much other allies spend on defence. Speaking to reporters at a press conference afterwards, Mr Johnson said member countries were making ""real progress"" towards meeting a target to spend 2% or more of their economic output on defence. Asked whether President Trump was good for the UK, the prime minister said the US had always ""should shoulder to shoulder"" with the country. He added that the country's response after theSalisbury poisoningslast year had been a ""fantastic testament to the transatlantic alliance"". Pressed directly to comment on Mr Trump as a leader, Mr Johnson said the administration he leads ""could not have been more supportive"". Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said his party was committed to remaining part of the Nato alliance, adding it was ""important to be part of"". ""I think we'll have to contribute to world peace through Nato and any other alliance, principally through the United Nations,"" he added. Although Labour's manifesto pledges to maintain the UK's commitment to Nato, Mr Johnson accused Labour of wanting to ""destroy"" it. Mr Corbyn has previously attacked the organisation ""as a danger to peace"", but on Wednesday said: ""We have decided we'll remain in Nato as a party, and that's it."" He added that he thought Nato was going in the ""wrong"" direction back in 2011, but the alliance has since ""changed its focus"". France's President Emmanuel Macron, Boris Johnson, Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan and German Chancellor Angela Merkel met at Downing Street On Tuesday evening, leaders attended receptions at Downing Street and at Buckingham Palace. The prime minister held talks with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Emmanuel Macron and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to discuss Syria, Libya and counter-terrorism at No 10. He had faced questions over whether he was avoiding a one-to-one meeting with Mr Trump, over concerns it could blow his election campaign off course, but Downing Street said the two men had a low-key, off camera meeting. On Wednesday, Mr Johnson said he had not talked about the NHS during the meeting, but did talk about ""all manner of areas of cooperation, from Nato to Syria to trade"". Labour has claimedthroughout the election campaignthat the future of the health service could be threatened by a post-Brexit trade deal with the US. Later in the evening,Mr Johnson was filmed chatting with a group of leaders during a reception at Buckingham Palace -they appeared to be discussing the US president. Mr Johnson said it was ""complete nonsense"" to suggest he did not take Donald Trump seriously after the video emerged. President Trump has cancelled a planned press conference, telling reporters: ""We'll go directly back. I think we've done plenty of news conferences."" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn - who said he intended to ask the US president for ""reassurances"" that the NHS would be ""off the table"" in post-Brexit trade talks - was also at the reception, but says he did not have an opportunity to speak to him. Speaking at a press conference earlier in the day, Mr Trump had said he wanted ""absolutely nothing to do with"" the NHS, adding he would not touch it even if it was handed to his administration ""on a silver platter"". Asked whether he could work with Mr Corbyn as prime minister, he said he could ""work with anybody"", although earlier he said he thought Mr Johnson would do a ""good job"".

"Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said he would press ahead with a digital sales tax even after the US threatened to punish France for a similar move. In a proposal first outlined last year, large online companies face a tax of 2% of UK sales from April 2020. Mr Johnson said digital companies needed to make a ""fairer contribution"". Donald Trump has threatened to impose taxes on French goods in retaliation for a digital services tax that would affect Google, Amazon and Facebook. Ahead of Wednesday's Nato meeting in Watford, the US President said: ""We've taxed wine and we have other taxes scheduled. ""We'd rather not do that, but that's the way it would work. So it's either going to work out, or we'll work out some mutually beneficial tax."" The US said it would apply tariffs of up to 100% on $2.4bn (Â£1.8bn) of cheese, Champagne, handbags and other French products. Budget 2018: Tech giants face digital services tax US threatens tax on champagne and French cheese The US has made clear that other countries pursuing a digital sales tax could face similar action. Multinational companies including Google and Facebook have been criticised for paying very little tax in some countries despite booking large revenues due to the way profits can be reported in lower tax jurisdictions. A multilateral solution is being sought but some countries, including the UK, are introducing interim taxes. ""On the digital services tax, I do think we need to look at the operation of the big digital companies and the huge revenues they have in this country and the amount of tax that they pay,"" Mr Johnson said late on Tuesday. ""We need to sort that out. They need to make a fairer contribution."" The UK's tax was first suggested by Philip Hammond, the former chancellor and could initially raise almost Â£500m a year. The pledge to implement the tax is contained in the Conservative manifesto. The Labour Party has also promised a tax on ""multinationals"".  In the party's press release about the plans last month, ""Amazon, Facebook and Google"" were mentioned specifically. France is imposing a 3% tax on any digital company with revenue of more than â¬750m ($850m; Â£670m), of which at least â¬25m is generated in France. The tax will be back-dated to early 2019, and is expected to raise about â¬400m this year.

In a statement issued after talks at a luxury resort near Watford, leaders acknowledged the ""challenges"" posed by China and Russia, and pledged to take ""stronger action"" against terrorism. Trump on UK election: 'I can work with any PM' Nato leaders to meet as alliance's cracks show On Tuesday, Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said countries in the alliance had added $130bn (Â£100bn) to defence budgets since 2016, and that this number would increase to $400bn by 2024. US President Donald Trump has frequently criticised how much other allies spend on defence. Speaking to reporters at a press conference afterwards, Mr Johnson said member countries were making ""real progress"" towards meeting a target to spend 2% or more of their economic output on defence. Asked whether President Trump was good for the UK, the prime minister said the US had always ""should shoulder to shoulder"" with the country. He added that the country's response after theSalisbury poisoningslast year had been a ""fantastic testament to the transatlantic alliance"". Pressed directly to comment on Mr Trump as a leader, Mr Johnson said the administration he leads ""could not have been more supportive"". Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said his party was committed to remaining part of the Nato alliance, adding it was ""important to be part of"". ""I think we'll have to contribute to world peace through Nato and any other alliance, principally through the United Nations,"" he added. Although Labour's manifesto pledges to maintain the UK's commitment to Nato, Mr Johnson accused Labour of wanting to ""destroy"" it. Mr Corbyn has previously attacked the organisation ""as a danger to peace"", but on Wednesday said: ""We have decided we'll remain in Nato as a party, and that's it."" He added that he thought Nato was going in the ""wrong"" direction back in 2011, but the alliance has since ""changed its focus"". France's President Emmanuel Macron, Boris Johnson, Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan and German Chancellor Angela Merkel met at Downing Street On Tuesday evening, leaders attended receptions at Downing Street and at Buckingham Palace. The prime minister held talks with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Emmanuel Macron and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to discuss Syria, Libya and counter-terrorism at No 10. He had faced questions over whether he was avoiding a one-to-one meeting with Mr Trump, over concerns it could blow his election campaign off course, but Downing Street said the two men had a low-key, off camera meeting. On Wednesday, Mr Johnson said he had not talked about the NHS during the meeting, but did talk about ""all manner of areas of cooperation, from Nato to Syria to trade"". Labour has claimedthroughout the election campaignthat the future of the health service could be threatened by a post-Brexit trade deal with the US. Later in the evening,Mr Johnson was filmed chatting with a group of leaders during a reception at Buckingham Palace -they appeared to be discussing the US president. Mr Johnson said it was ""complete nonsense"" to suggest he did not take Donald Trump seriously after the video emerged. President Trump has cancelled a planned press conference, telling reporters: ""We'll go directly back. I think we've done plenty of news conferences."" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn - who said he intended to ask the US president for ""reassurances"" that the NHS would be ""off the table"" in post-Brexit trade talks - was also at the reception, but says he did not have an opportunity to speak to him. Speaking at a press conference earlier in the day, Mr Trump had said he wanted ""absolutely nothing to do with"" the NHS, adding he would not touch it even if it was handed to his administration ""on a silver platter"". Asked whether he could work with Mr Corbyn as prime minister, he said he could ""work with anybody"", although earlier he said he thought Mr Johnson would do a ""good job"".

"London Bridge attacker Usman Khan attended two counter-terrorism programmes that had not been fully tested to see if they were effective, BBC News has discovered. Khan, who was convicted of a terrorism offence in 2012, killed Jack Merritt, 25, and Saskia Jones, 23, on Friday. He had completed two rehabilitation schemes during the eight years he spent in prison and following his release. The government says such programmes are kept ""under constant review"". Three others were injured after Khan launched the attack at a prisoner rehabilitation event inside Fishmongers' Hall near London Bridge. Inquests into the deaths of Mr Merritt and Ms Jones were opened and adjourned at the Old Bailey on Wednesday. The court heard that both of them died after being stabbed in the chest. The date for the full inquests is still to be decided. City of London senior coroner Alison Hewitt also opened and adjourned the inquest into Khan, who died from multiple gunshot wounds after being shot by police. The inquest heard that Khan had been at the venue to participate in group workshops. London Bridge: What we know What we know about the London Bridge attacker During his time in prison, Khan completed a course for people convicted of extremism offences and after his release went on a scheme to address the root causes of terrorism. The first course Khan went on, the Healthy Identity Intervention Programme, was piloted from 2010 and is now the main rehabilitation scheme for prisoners convicted of offences linked to extremism. Usman Khan had been jailed in 2012 Last year, the Ministry of Justice published the findings of research into the pilot project which found it was ""viewed positively"" by a sample of those who attended and ran the course. However, the department has not completed any work to test whether the scheme prevents reoffending or successfully tackles extremist behaviour. There has also been no evaluation of the impact of the Desistance and Disengagement Programme, which Khan took part in after his release last year. This video can not be played What happened at London Bridge? Government officials pointed out that the schemes have not been operating for long enough for the results to be assessed, but a spokesperson said all offender behaviour programmes were kept under constant review. The spokesperson said: ""All our offender behaviour programmes are monitored, evaluated and kept under constant review to ensure that they are effective in reducing reoffending and protecting the public."" The Home Office ""fact-sheet"" on the Desistence and Disengagement programme contains eight pieces of ""key information"". But it omits the really key bit - that the programme has never been evaluated. In other words, we do not know if it works. The same is true of the Healthy Identity Interventions course. Although the Ministry of Justice conducted a ""process evaluation"", to check the pilot version was being run properly, we will not know for another two years if it is achieving results. So, these schemes, like many other offender behaviour projects, are, in essence, experimental. Some say the only way of knowing if they are any good is to try them out. Others argue the risks of doing that are too high, pointing to the once-flagship Sex Offender Treatment Programme, which was used for 25 years until research showed that it increased the likelihood of reoffending. Rehabilitating convicted terrorists is as complex and challenging as it gets - but a little more openness and honesty is required about the methods that are being used. A man who recently went through the same Desistence and Disengagement programme as Khan says the London Bridge attacker ""shouldn't have been let out of prison"". The man - who asked to remain anonymous - was acquitted of terror charges but was required to wear an electronic tag. This video can not be played Legal correspondent Clive Coleman looks at why Usman Khan was freed from prison Speaking to Sima Kotecha on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he said: ""I had a mentor who came to see me at least twice a week. ""As time went on the authorities saw a change within myself."" Asked why such mentoring worked for him but not for Khan, the man said: ""I wanted to make a change. ""Other people may think that [terror] is the only route because they've been radicalised and that's all they know."" He added that ""anybody can manipulate"" when asked whether people could convince their mentors that they have moved away from extremism. He said: ""I don't know his character, but anybody can manipulate."" Khan, 28, was arrested in December 2010 and sentenced in 2012 to indeterminate detention for public protection with a minimum jail term of eight years, having pleaded guilty to preparing terrorist acts. He had been part of an al-Qaeda inspired group that considered attacks in the UK,including at the London Stock Exchange. In 2013the Court of Appeal quashed the sentence, replacing it with a 16-year fixed term, and ordered Khan to serve at least half this - eight years - behind bars. Since his release from prison in December 2018, Khan had been living in Stafford and was required to wear a GPS tag. Khan was armed with two knives and was wearing a fake suicide vest during the attack at Fishmongers' Hall in the City of London on Friday. He wastackled by members of the public,including ex-offenders from the conference, before he was shot dead by police. Among those praised for their bravery during the attack was a porter - known as Lukasz - who tried to fight Khan at Fishmongers' Hall. He issued a statement through Scotland Yard on Tuesday, saying that contrary to some reports, he had used a pole to tackle Khan while someone else used a narwhal tusk. ""The man attacked me, after which he left the building,"" he said. ""A number of us followed him out but I stopped at the bollards of the bridge. I had been stabbed and was later taken to hospital to be treated."" He said he was ""thankful"" that he had now returned home. ""When the attack happened, I acted instinctively,"" he said. ""I am now coming to terms with the whole traumatic incident and would like the space to do this in privacy, with the support of my family."" He wanted to express his condolences to the families who had ""lost precious loved ones"", he added, as well as sending his best wishes to ""everyone affected by this sad and pointless attack"". Two women were also injured in the attack. They remain in a stable condition in hospital.

"Larry Page and Sergey Brin Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin have announced they are stepping down from top roles at the online giant's parent company. They will leave their respective roles as Alphabet's chief executive officer and president but remain on the board. Google's CEO Sundar Pichai will become Alphabet's CEO too, a statement said. Alphabet was created in 2015 as part of a corporate restructuring of Google, which Mr Page and Mr Brin famously founded in a California garage in 1998. The parent company was intended to make the tech giant's activities ""cleaner and more accountable"" as it expanded from internet search into other areas such as self-driving cars. The pair moved from Google to Alphabet when it was formed - saying they were making the jump to focus on starting new initiatives. Who is Sundar Pichai and what does Alphabet do? How Google became so big Fired employees claim Google is punishing them But in a blog post on Tuesday,external, the co-founders, both aged 46, announced they were stepping back from the day-to-day management of the company. A joint letter said they would remain ""actively involved as board members, shareholders and co-founders"", but said it was the ""natural time to simplify our management structure"". The pair (photographed in 2008) founded Google 21 years ago ""We've never been ones to hold on to management roles when we think there's a better way to run the company. And Alphabet and Google no longer need two CEOs and a President,"" their letter said. They also declared it was time to ""assume the role of proud parents - offering advice and love, but not daily nagging"" and insisted there was ""no better person"" to lead the company into the future than Mr Pichai. The 47-year-old was born in India, where he studied engineering. He went on to study in the US at Stanford University and the University of Pennsylvania before joining Google in 2004. Sundar Pichai will now serve as CEO of both companies In a statement, he said he was ""excited"" about the transition and paid tribute to Mr Page and Mr Brin. ""The founders have given all of us an incredible chance to have an impact on the world,"" Mr Pichai said. ""Thanks to them, we have a timeless mission, enduring values, and a culture of collaboration and exploration that makes it exciting to come to work every day. ""It's a strong foundation on which we will continue to build. Can't wait to see where we go next and look forward to continuing the journey with all of you."" This move represents the most significant shake-up of leadership at Google since its inception - the first time the dynamic duo of Brin and Page, a legendary Silicon Valley partnership, won't hold important management roles in the company they founded. In reality, though, that's been the case for some time - the public face of the firm has been Mr Pichai and, to a lesser extent, YouTube chief executive Susan Wojcicki. But Tuesday's announcement makes it absolutely clear - Mr Page and Mr Brin aren't running the company. Yet while the pair are apparently relinquishing management duties, it won't mean giving up ultimate power. Between them, they control 51% of voting rights on Alphabet's board. This won't change. They likened their new role to being ""proud parents"" to the company, looking on with close interest and care. But should they feel the need, they can override any decision Mr Pichai makes - with little more than a parental ""because we said so"". Mr Page and Brin are ranked the 10th and 14th richest individuals in the world,externalby Forbes, with each of them estimated to be worth about $50bn (Â£38bn). The American business magazine ranks Alphabet as the 17th largest public company in the world,external, with an estimated market value of $863bn. Who is Sundar Pichai and what does Alphabet do?

"Researchers say that carbon dioxide emissions this year have risen slightly, despite a drop in the use of coal. The Global Carbon Project's annual analysis of emission trends suggests that CO2 will go up by 0.6% in 2019. The rise is due to continuing strong growth in the utilisation of oil and gas. Since the Paris agreement was set out in 2015, CO2 emissions have risen by 4%. Greta Thunberg: People underestimate 'angry kids' Last decade 'on course' to be warmest Critical year for climate change begins in Madrid Last year saw a strong rise in emissions of almost 3%, with strong demand for coal in China being the main factor. There was also a surge in demand for oil, driven by a booming global market for cars, particularly SUVs. This year's modest rise, if indeed it is a rise, as the margin of error is large, reflects some significant changes in the demand for fossil fuels. While global emissions from coal use fell by less than 1%, this masks some huge drops in countries like the US and across the European Union. ""Through most of 2019 it was looking as if coal use would grow globally, but weaker than expected economic performance in China and India, and a record hydropower year in India - caused by a strong monsoon - quickly changed the prospects for growth in coal use,"" said Robbie Andrew, a senior researcher at the Cicero Centre for International Climate Research, part of the Global Carbon Project. ""Coal use in both the US and the EU28 has dropped substantially, possibly by as much as 10% in both regions in 2019 alone, helping push down global coal consumption,"" Mr Andrew said. The drop in coal as a source of energy was offset by the continued rise of oil and gas. The data comes as the COP25 climate summit continues in Madrid amid a growing sense of crisis. This video can not be played COP25: What you need to know about the climate conference Gas use rose by a robust 2.6%, and while renewable sources like wind and solar have also grown substantially, according to the authors the greener fuels have merely slowed the rise in the growth of fossil fuel emissions. ""Compared to coal, natural gas is a cleaner fossil fuel, but unabated natural gas use merely cooks the planet more slowly than coal,"" said Dr Glen Peters, also from Cicero. Climate summit told of nation's 'fight to death' What is climate change? According to the Global Carbon Project researchers, the continuing use of fossil fuel-based technology is threatening the targets that countries have set for themselves in the Paris climate agreement. ""This is still not good news this year, as the emissions are still going up, the emissions are going more slowly, so we are making progress but the actions need to be higher in terms of implementing renewable energy and removing those tech that produce CO2,"" said Prof Corinne Le QuÃ©rÃ© from the University of East Anglia (UEA), another author of the research. Coal use has dropped substantially in both the US and EU28 There are some interesting developments on a country level in the emissions data. US emissions have declined by around 1% per year every year since 2005. That trend continued in 2019. Even with President Trump's favourable policies towards fossil fuels, cheap gas, wind and solar are replacing coal. This video can not be played The man who took wind power to another level China's emissions are expected to rise up by 2.6% but would have been higher if it wasn't for slower economic growth and a weaker demand for electricity. Similarly in India, slower economic growth has seen a much smaller rise in emissions expected to be 1.8% compared to the normal recent rate of 5.1%. The figures show just how far back the world is in terms of meeting the goals of cutting carbon quickly to avoid dangerous temperature rises. ""There are lots of countries now that are ramping up their policies on climate change but still not big enough,"" said Prof Le QuÃ©rÃ©. ""There's not enough countries making commitments. The big emitters are still awaited at the table - so 2020 will be a really big year for countries on climate change.""

"Larry Page and Sergey Brin Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin have announced they are stepping down from top roles at the online giant's parent company. They will leave their respective roles as Alphabet's chief executive officer and president but remain on the board. Google's CEO Sundar Pichai will become Alphabet's CEO too, a statement said. Alphabet was created in 2015 as part of a corporate restructuring of Google, which Mr Page and Mr Brin famously founded in a California garage in 1998. The parent company was intended to make the tech giant's activities ""cleaner and more accountable"" as it expanded from internet search into other areas such as self-driving cars. The pair moved from Google to Alphabet when it was formed - saying they were making the jump to focus on starting new initiatives. Who is Sundar Pichai and what does Alphabet do? How Google became so big Fired employees claim Google is punishing them But in a blog post on Tuesday,external, the co-founders, both aged 46, announced they were stepping back from the day-to-day management of the company. A joint letter said they would remain ""actively involved as board members, shareholders and co-founders"", but said it was the ""natural time to simplify our management structure"". The pair (photographed in 2008) founded Google 21 years ago ""We've never been ones to hold on to management roles when we think there's a better way to run the company. And Alphabet and Google no longer need two CEOs and a President,"" their letter said. They also declared it was time to ""assume the role of proud parents - offering advice and love, but not daily nagging"" and insisted there was ""no better person"" to lead the company into the future than Mr Pichai. The 47-year-old was born in India, where he studied engineering. He went on to study in the US at Stanford University and the University of Pennsylvania before joining Google in 2004. Sundar Pichai will now serve as CEO of both companies In a statement, he said he was ""excited"" about the transition and paid tribute to Mr Page and Mr Brin. ""The founders have given all of us an incredible chance to have an impact on the world,"" Mr Pichai said. ""Thanks to them, we have a timeless mission, enduring values, and a culture of collaboration and exploration that makes it exciting to come to work every day. ""It's a strong foundation on which we will continue to build. Can't wait to see where we go next and look forward to continuing the journey with all of you."" This move represents the most significant shake-up of leadership at Google since its inception - the first time the dynamic duo of Brin and Page, a legendary Silicon Valley partnership, won't hold important management roles in the company they founded. In reality, though, that's been the case for some time - the public face of the firm has been Mr Pichai and, to a lesser extent, YouTube chief executive Susan Wojcicki. But Tuesday's announcement makes it absolutely clear - Mr Page and Mr Brin aren't running the company. Yet while the pair are apparently relinquishing management duties, it won't mean giving up ultimate power. Between them, they control 51% of voting rights on Alphabet's board. This won't change. They likened their new role to being ""proud parents"" to the company, looking on with close interest and care. But should they feel the need, they can override any decision Mr Pichai makes - with little more than a parental ""because we said so"". Mr Page and Brin are ranked the 10th and 14th richest individuals in the world,externalby Forbes, with each of them estimated to be worth about $50bn (Â£38bn). The American business magazine ranks Alphabet as the 17th largest public company in the world,external, with an estimated market value of $863bn. Who is Sundar Pichai and what does Alphabet do?

"The Metrolink tram system in Greater Manchester is one scheme that could benefit The Conservatives have promised Â£4.2bn of new spending on local train, bus and tram services if they win the 12 December general election. The party said the cash, which would become available from 2022, would help fund transport projects outside London. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said it would transform services ""in towns and cities across the country"". But Labour called it ""pathetic"" and the Liberal Democrats said the Tories ""simply don't get public transport"". There has been much criticism of transport services outside London and particularly in the north, where fares are often higher and investment lower than in the capital. There would be more money for local rail projects Treasury figures published on Wednesday suggest transport spending in Londonis almost two-and-a-half times more per person than across the north of England. But Mr Shapps said the Conservatives' Local Public Transport Fund would ""kick start the transformation of services so they match those in London"". This would ensure ""more frequent and better services, more electrification, modern buses and trains and contactless smart ticketing"". The investment, which would be funded through the party's decision not to cut corporation tax, would go to eight mayoral or combined authority areas in England. They include the North East, Tees Valley, West Yorkshire, Sheffield City Region, Greater Manchester, Liverpool City Region, West Midlands and West of England. The West Midlands Metro tram could also benefit Local authorities would have to bid for the cash. They would also be given more control over things like setting fares, station upgrades and service patterns. But they would also be expected to put money towards the schemes themselves. Examples of the sorts of projects that might get money include: A new metro or light rail in West Yorkshire, including to Dewsbury, Pudsey and the Spen Valley extensions to the Metrolink tram system in Greater Manchester, including to Stockport and Bolton upgrades to the Tyne & Wear Metro and new heavy rail lines in the North East extensions to the West Midlands Metro tram, including to Solihull and Birmingham Airport The Conservatives also promised a ""national bus strategy"" and a long-term funding settlement for buses in the 2020 Spending Review. They said the new fund would not cover pan-regional transport projects such as Northern Powerhouse Rail, which will be paid for from different budgets. There are a couple of important caveats to this announcement. The first is that the funding will become available from 2022. So although it would amount to a Â£4.2bn fund over five years, just Â£1.68bn of it would be made available for English city regions by the end of the next parliament. The second is that Â£840m a year, shared among several city regions, won't go a very long way on transport infrastructure. However, the Conservatives are clear that the fund wouldn't cover all of the projects on their wish list. And they expect local authorities to generate extra capital through initiatives such as commercial developments in or around train stations. What's clear is that all of the parties want to be seen as champions of transport infrastructure outside of London. Shadow transport secretary Andy McDonald said: ""This announcement is a pathetic attempt to cover up the government's disastrous and incompetent failure to invest in public transport. ""Tory cuts have caused public transport fares to rise at twice the rate of wages and thousands of bus routes to be cut, worsening congestion on our roads as a result. ""It's time for real change. Labour will invest in transport across the country delivering the major and local infrastructure projects every region of our country deserves."" Labour's plans for local transport includeslashing rail fares by a thirdacross the country and making train travel free for under-16s. The party also promises to reinstate 3,000 bus routes that have been cut and says it would deliver rail electrification and expansion across the country, including in Wales. Labour has promised to cut rail fares by a third The Liberal Democrats have promised to invest more in buses, trams and railways, while encouraging walking and cycling to protect the environment. They would also freeze peak-time and season ticket fares for five years. Liberal Democrat shadow transport secretary Wera Hobhouse said: ""The Conservatives have overseen a decline of more than 200 million bus journeys since 2015 and failed to invest in our railways across the UK, all while Johnson dreams up vanity projects like his island airport, a dud garden bridge and London buses that simply don't work. ""The Tories simply don't get the need for excellent public transport which gives people a real alternative to individual car use. ""At the same time, Boris Johnson's reckless Brexit plans would be disastrous for the economy, meaning less money to fund vital transport and infrastructure projects.""

"A Christmas advert from exercise bike company Peloton has been widely mocked on social media as being ""sexist"", ""out of touch"", and even ""dystopian"". The ad, which has been viewed more than a million times on YouTube, sees a woman receive an exercise bike for Christmas from her husband. She then records her workouts over the following year in a vlog and presents it to him as a way of saying thank you. ""A year ago, I didn't realise how much this would change me,"" she says. The criticism knocked the company's shares, which closed more than 9% lower on Tuesday. Peloton sells fitness equipment - with bikes priced at more than $2,000 - fitted with touchscreens. Users then purchase a subscription to access classes streamed live and on-demand. The New York-based company released the ad,externalin November, but criticism on social media has increased markedly in recent days. Allow YouTube content?

Some people complained it is sexist for a man to give his wife an exercise bike for Christmas, as it suggested he wanted her to lose weight. Others noted that - despite claims the bike has ""changed"" her - the already slim actress who plays the main character looks exactly the same. Peloton: 'It's borderline addiction' Exercise start-up Peloton gears up for stock debut Some also said the ad had a dystopian vibe and compared it to a horror film.

"Members of the Royal College of Nursing union outside the Royal Victoria Hospital on Tuesday Industrial action by healthcare workers is intensifying as Northern Ireland's nurses take part in 24 hours of action. Health workers are  industrial action in protest at pay and staffing levels which they claim are ""unsafe"". In an unprecedented joint statement, the six health trusts said the action was likely to result in ""a significant risk to patient safety"". Last week, the Royal College of Surgeons warnedNI's healthcare system was ""at the point of collapse"". On Tuesday, members of the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) are refusing to do any work that is not directly related to patient care. Full details and advice on current health care services can be found on theHealth and Social Care Board website,external. Northern Ireland's Chief Medical Officer Dr Michael McBride called on all sides involved to step back, pause and resume negotiations. ""We now need to compromise, all parties need to compromise and I would appeal to all parties to compromise."" ""Let's get around the table, let's find a way through this, let's find a way through that recognises that, at present, the department neither has the authority nor the budget to meet the trade unions' demands - the reasonable demands they are making."" Patricia Cowan said she took part in cancer diagnosis testing on Monday Meanwhile, it has emerged that a nurse has said cancer diagnosis appointments continued at Belfast's Royal Victoria Hospital (RVH) despite claims by the Belfast Trust that they had been cancelled. Patricia Cowan, a specialist dermatologist nurse, said she took part in those diagnoses on Monday. On Monday, chief executiveMartin Dillon said outpatient cancellations meant people due to have cancer diagnostic tests this week had had their appointments postponed. The nurse said that about two thirds of booked patients turned up for appointments on Monday morning and, in the afternoon, only one person in a clinic booked for 12 people did not show. ""They were new patients who had waited for goodness knows who long for an appointment which was cancelled by the trust,"" she said. In a statement, the Belfast Trust said it was ""always aware that some staff would be available despite the industrial action"". But the trust said that it could not guarantee the required level of staffing to provide the outpatient appointments ""The decision to cancel appointments remains the only responsible course of action in the circumstances. Otherwise, large number of patients would be attending in circumstances where we could not guarantee they would be provided."" Dr Stevens called for a political solution to an ""acute financial problem"" Speaking earlier on Tuesday, Dr Tony Stevens, chief executive of the Northern Health Trust said the system was ""coping, but just coping"". ""We have got a system that copes, that is safe, but it has very little tolerance. Our concern is the strike action will just tip us that little bit beyond where we're comfortable,"" he said in an interview on BBC NI's Good Morning Ulster. ""There is an increased risk that somebody is going to get missed or that something is going to happen."" Dr Stevens said he had ""every sympathy"" with health care staff and their frustration, but he said the Department of Health had been clear about its lack of resources. The trust chief called for a ""political solution"" to what he described as ""a long-standing and now acute financial problem"". Former health chief John Compton told BBC NI's Talkback that there had been ""a pretty profound breakdown in trust between the work force and the system"". ""For me, this is a political decision at the end of the day,"" he said. ""The only political entity that we have at this point in time is the secretary of state. Therefore, I think it really is incumbent on the political system to respond to what is a growing and really quite unpleasant set of circumstances - of course for the staff - but mostly for the citizens of this country."" Speaking about the industrial action, Kevin McAdam of Unite, said: ""If it has inconvenienced our public, we ask you to understand that this is your fight. ""We are fighting this fight for you for better services to make sure there is enough staff to deliver the healthcare you rightly expect."" He said he firmly believed there was money to pay health workers in line with their colleagues England, Scotland and Wales. The RCN said it has about 16,000 members in Northern Ireland, where some 17,000 nurses and 5,000 nursing support workers are employed in total. In November,nurses voted to take part in strike action for the first time in the 103-year historyof the RCN union. On its first day of industrial action - which started at 00:01 GMT on Tuesday and lasts for 24 hours - RCN members are not striking, but are refusing to do any task that is not directly ""patient specific"". This includes things like: not working bank or overtime shifts not working unpaid hours not completing paper work other than individual patient records Not answering phones on wards Not doing administrative tests Not collecting prescriptions or pharmacy in the community Two more days of industrial action, short of strike action, are to be held on 10 and 11 December. The first day of full strike action by RCN members is set to happen the week before Christmas, on 18 December. On Monday night, the Unite trade union said its members had also voted to strike on 18 December. It said it has 4,000 members who work in the health service and they would join members of the Royal College of Nursing, Unison and NIPSA in strike action. The chief executives of the health and social care trusts and the head of the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service said they recognised the dedication of health staff, as well as the need for ""a long-term funding settlement that addresses service, workforce and pay pressures in a sustainable manner"". ""The level of escalation... is causing us real concern with regard to service continuity during what is already a very demanding period,"" they said. ""We have been struggling with a system where funding has been made available on a yearly basis, which makes it impossible to plan for the long term. ""Demand is increasing and will continue to do so, meaning that the current system is simply unsustainable."" Members of Unison - NI's largest health workers' union - started their industrial action last week As a result of the industrial action, the Belfast Health Trust cancelled more than 10,000 outpatient appointments and surgeries this week. The South Eastern Health Trust has also cancelled some services but on a smaller scale. In Belfast, the following hospitals cancelled all outpatient appointments, day case procedures and planned surgeries on Tuesday and Thursday: Royal Victoria Hospital (including the children's hospital, maternity hospital and school of dentistry) Belfast City Hospital Mater Hospital Musgrave Park Hospital However, some outpatient appointments are going ahead at these places: Health and wellbeing centres Community facilities Chemotherapy or radiotherapy at either the Bridgewater suite or cancer centre at Belfast City Hospital Macular clinic at Fairview Paediatric oncology at the Children's Hospital On Wednesday, all outpatient services will run as normal. Planned surgeries and day case procedures will still be postponed. Emergency services and day centres are not affected by the industrial action. In the South Eastern Health Trust area, all routine outpatient appointments at the Ulster Hospital have been cancelled on Wednesday, with the exception of maternity and children's services. On Friday, outpatient departments at Ulster Hospital, Lagan Valley Hospital, Downe Hospital, Ards Hospital and Bangor Hospital will be closed in the afternoon.

"This video can not be played President Trump is on his best behaviour, but is everyone else? US President Donald Trump has called Justin Trudeau ""two-faced"" over a video in which the Canadian leader appears to mock him at a meeting of Nato leaders. Footage showed Mr Trudeau, UK PM Boris Johnson and French leader Emmanuel Macron discussing an impromptu press conference held by Mr Trump. Nato leaders agreed a statement of unity but the 70th anniversary meeting held near London also saw several rows. Mr Trump cancelled a press conference planned for after the summit. He told reporters: ""We'll go directly back. I think we've done plenty of news conferences."" The brief video posted on Twitter by Canada's public broadcaster, CBC, showed Mr Trudeau chatting with a group of leaders, including Mr Johnson, Mr Macron, Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, and Queen Elizabeth's daughter Princess Anne at Buckingham Palace. At the start of the footage, Mr Johnson asked Mr Macron: ""Is that why you were late?"" Mr Trudeau then interjects: ""He was late because he takes a 40-minute press conference off the top."" Five hot mics that got leaders in trouble Mr Macron then appears to tell an anecdote, but his words are drowned out by background noise. An amused Mr Trudeau then replies: ""Oh yeah, yeah, he announced... [inaudible]. You just watched his team's jaw drop to the floor."" None of them appeared to realise they were being recorded. This video can not be played Donald Trump says Justin Trudeau is ""two-faced"" - but Trudeau says they've a good relationship In response, Mr Trump said of Mr Trudeau: ""He's two-faced... I find him to be a nice guy, but the truth is I called him out on the fact that he's not paying 2% [of national GDP towards defence] and I guess he's not very happy about it. ""He's not paying 2% and he should be paying 2%. Canada - they have money. Look, I'm representing the US and he should be paying more than he's paying, he understands it... I can imagine he's not that happy but that's the way it is."" Asked about the video, Mr Johnson told reporters: ""It's complete nonsense. I don't know where that's come from."" Mr Trudeau later told reporters that they hadn't been laughing about Mr Trump's press conference, but about the location of the next G7 summit - Camp David, the US presidential country retreat. ""I have a very good relationship with Trump,"" he added. In the statement, Nato leaders said: ""To stay secure we must look to the future together."" It then acknowledged the ""challenges"" posed by China and Russia, and pledged to take ""stronger action"" against terrorism. This video can not be played Feuds reunited? The rifts behind Nato's big birthday Although the 29-member bloc's future is not in doubt, there are disagreements over Turkey's recent military action in northern Syria; the levels of military spending by members; and recent comments by Mr Macron that the alliance is ""brain dead"". Despite the divisions,Mr Johnson - the host of the event - described Nato as a ""giant shield of solidarity""that ""protects nearly a billion people"", saying at the start of the meeting at a luxury resort in Watford: ""As long as we stand together, no-one can hope to defeat us."" This video can not be played Boris Johnson tells fellow Nato leaders: ""Peace cannot be taken for granted"" Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg cited increased spending commitments on defence by European allies and Canada, saying: ""Nato is the most successful alliance in history because we've changed as the world has changed."" On Tuesday, he said those nations had added $130bn (Â£100bn) to defence budgets since 2016, and that this number would increase to $400bn by 2024. Mr Trump has frequently and forcefully criticised how much other allies spend on defence. The first day of the special anniversary summit saw tensions bubble to the surface, with Mr Trump and Mr Macronsparring over Nato's role, Turkey, and Islamic State group (IS) fightersduring a news conference. Relations between the two leaders were already strained amida dispute over taxes and trade, and comments from the French president last month that the US commitment to the alliance was fading. Troubled Nato not in party mood In pictures: 70 years of Nato What does the US do for Nato? Mr Trump, who once called Nato ""obsolete"", had earlier hit back by saying Mr Macron had been ""very disrespectful"" by describing Nato as ""brain dead"", calling them ""nasty"" comments. Mr Macron said he stood by his remarks. President Trump and Mr Johnson held unscheduled bilateral talks and, ahead of Wednesday's talks, Mr Trump tweeted they both had ""talked about numerous subjects including Nato and trade"". Nato, the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, started out in 1949 with just 12 countries as members but having now expanded to a bloc of 29, it is increasingly difficult for the alliance to project a united front. Nato estimates for 2019 show there are now eight countries - in addition to the US - meeting the target agreed by all members to spend 2% or more of their gross domestic product (GDP, a measure of economic output) on defence. Nato leaders attended a reception hosted by the Queen and Prince of Wales on Tuesday Before departing for London,Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan also said he would oppose a Nato defence planfor the Baltic region and Poland if the bloc did not support Turkey over its fight against Kurdish groups in Syria it considers terrorists. Mr Stoltenberg later told reporters that the alliance had been able to resolve the disagreement with Turkey, allowing Nato's plans to go ahead. The Queen talks to President Trump and his wife Melania during Tuesday's reception As well as the Turkish issue, talks had centred on the rising threats of China and Russia. After the summit, Mr Macron said that while Russia was a threat to Nato in some respects, in others the country could be a ""partner"". ""Around the table, would everyone recognise Russia as an enemy? I don't think that is the case,"" he told a news conference. ""On some topics Russia is seen as a threat, this is true... But Russia is also a partner in some issues. We're working and having concrete discussions with Russia on certain issues.""

"This video can not be played Watch the UK prime minister's message to fellow Nato leaders earlier Boris Johnson has hailed Nato as ""the most successful alliance in history"" after talks with leaders near London. The PM insisted there was ""very great solidarity"" within the alliance, amid tensions on its 70th anniversary. He also praised the role of the United States, adding the country had been a ""pillar of stability"" on security issues. Jeremy Corbyn said he wanted to ensure Nato focused on reducing ""tensions around the world"". Leaders of the 29-member military alliance have been discussing shared security issues at a special meeting to mark 70 years since its formation. In a statement issued after talks at a luxury resort near Watford, leaders acknowledged the ""challenges"" posed by China and Russia, and pledged to take ""stronger action"" against terrorism. Trump on UK election: 'I can work with any PM' Nato leaders to meet as alliance's cracks show On Tuesday, Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said countries in the alliance had added $130bn (Â£100bn) to defence budgets since 2016, and that this number would increase to $400bn by 2024. US President Donald Trump has frequently criticised how much other allies spend on defence. Speaking to reporters at a press conference afterwards, Mr Johnson said member countries were making ""real progress"" towards meeting a target to spend 2% or more of their economic output on defence. Asked whether President Trump was good for the UK, the prime minister said the US had always ""should shoulder to shoulder"" with the country. He added that the country's response after theSalisbury poisoningslast year had been a ""fantastic testament to the transatlantic alliance"". Pressed directly to comment on Mr Trump as a leader, Mr Johnson said the administration he leads ""could not have been more supportive"". Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said his party was committed to remaining part of the Nato alliance, adding it was ""important to be part of"". ""I think we'll have to contribute to world peace through Nato and any other alliance, principally through the United Nations,"" he added. Although Labour's manifesto pledges to maintain the UK's commitment to Nato, Mr Johnson accused Labour of wanting to ""destroy"" it. Mr Corbyn has previously attacked the organisation ""as a danger to peace"", but on Wednesday said: ""We have decided we'll remain in Nato as a party, and that's it."" He added that he thought Nato was going in the ""wrong"" direction back in 2011, but the alliance has since ""changed its focus"". France's President Emmanuel Macron, Boris Johnson, Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan and German Chancellor Angela Merkel met at Downing Street On Tuesday evening, leaders attended receptions at Downing Street and at Buckingham Palace. The prime minister held talks with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Emmanuel Macron and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to discuss Syria, Libya and counter-terrorism at No 10. He had faced questions over whether he was avoiding a one-to-one meeting with Mr Trump, over concerns it could blow his election campaign off course, but Downing Street said the two men had a low-key, off camera meeting. On Wednesday, Mr Johnson said he had not talked about the NHS during the meeting, but did talk about ""all manner of areas of cooperation, from Nato to Syria to trade"". Labour has claimedthroughout the election campaignthat the future of the health service could be threatened by a post-Brexit trade deal with the US. Later in the evening,Mr Johnson was filmed chatting with a group of leaders during a reception at Buckingham Palace -they appeared to be discussing the US president. Mr Johnson said it was ""complete nonsense"" to suggest he did not take Donald Trump seriously after the video emerged. President Trump has cancelled a planned press conference, telling reporters: ""We'll go directly back. I think we've done plenty of news conferences."" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn - who said he intended to ask the US president for ""reassurances"" that the NHS would be ""off the table"" in post-Brexit trade talks - was also at the reception, but says he did not have an opportunity to speak to him. Speaking at a press conference earlier in the day, Mr Trump had said he wanted ""absolutely nothing to do with"" the NHS, adding he would not touch it even if it was handed to his administration ""on a silver platter"". Asked whether he could work with Mr Corbyn as prime minister, he said he could ""work with anybody"", although earlier he said he thought Mr Johnson would do a ""good job"".

"Larry Page and Sergey Brin Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin have announced they are stepping down from top roles at the online giant's parent company. They will leave their respective roles as Alphabet's chief executive officer and president but remain on the board. Google's CEO Sundar Pichai will become Alphabet's CEO too, a statement said. Alphabet was created in 2015 as part of a corporate restructuring of Google, which Mr Page and Mr Brin famously founded in a California garage in 1998. The parent company was intended to make the tech giant's activities ""cleaner and more accountable"" as it expanded from internet search into other areas such as self-driving cars. The pair moved from Google to Alphabet when it was formed - saying they were making the jump to focus on starting new initiatives. Who is Sundar Pichai and what does Alphabet do? How Google became so big Fired employees claim Google is punishing them But in a blog post on Tuesday,external, the co-founders, both aged 46, announced they were stepping back from the day-to-day management of the company. A joint letter said they would remain ""actively involved as board members, shareholders and co-founders"", but said it was the ""natural time to simplify our management structure"". The pair (photographed in 2008) founded Google 21 years ago ""We've never been ones to hold on to management roles when we think there's a better way to run the company. And Alphabet and Google no longer need two CEOs and a President,"" their letter said. They also declared it was time to ""assume the role of proud parents - offering advice and love, but not daily nagging"" and insisted there was ""no better person"" to lead the company into the future than Mr Pichai. The 47-year-old was born in India, where he studied engineering. He went on to study in the US at Stanford University and the University of Pennsylvania before joining Google in 2004. Sundar Pichai will now serve as CEO of both companies In a statement, he said he was ""excited"" about the transition and paid tribute to Mr Page and Mr Brin. ""The founders have given all of us an incredible chance to have an impact on the world,"" Mr Pichai said. ""Thanks to them, we have a timeless mission, enduring values, and a culture of collaboration and exploration that makes it exciting to come to work every day. ""It's a strong foundation on which we will continue to build. Can't wait to see where we go next and look forward to continuing the journey with all of you."" This move represents the most significant shake-up of leadership at Google since its inception - the first time the dynamic duo of Brin and Page, a legendary Silicon Valley partnership, won't hold important management roles in the company they founded. In reality, though, that's been the case for some time - the public face of the firm has been Mr Pichai and, to a lesser extent, YouTube chief executive Susan Wojcicki. But Tuesday's announcement makes it absolutely clear - Mr Page and Mr Brin aren't running the company. Yet while the pair are apparently relinquishing management duties, it won't mean giving up ultimate power. Between them, they control 51% of voting rights on Alphabet's board. This won't change.

"This video can not be played President Trump is on his best behaviour, but is everyone else? US President Donald Trump has called Justin Trudeau ""two-faced"" over a video in which the Canadian leader appears to mock him at a meeting of Nato leaders. Footage showed Mr Trudeau, UK PM Boris Johnson and French leader Emmanuel Macron discussing an impromptu press conference held by Mr Trump. Nato leaders agreed a statement of unity but the 70th anniversary meeting held near London also saw several rows. Mr Trump cancelled a press conference planned for after the summit. He told reporters: ""We'll go directly back. I think we've done plenty of news conferences."" The brief video posted on Twitter by Canada's public broadcaster, CBC, showed Mr Trudeau chatting with a group of leaders, including Mr Johnson, Mr Macron, Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, and Queen Elizabeth's daughter Princess Anne at Buckingham Palace. At the start of the footage, Mr Johnson asked Mr Macron: ""Is that why you were late?"" Mr Trudeau then interjects: ""He was late because he takes a 40-minute press conference off the top."" Five hot mics that got leaders in trouble Mr Macron then appears to tell an anecdote, but his words are drowned out by background noise. An amused Mr Trudeau then replies: ""Oh yeah, yeah, he announced... [inaudible]. You just watched his team's jaw drop to the floor."" None of them appeared to realise they were being recorded. This video can not be played Donald Trump says Justin Trudeau is ""two-faced"" - but Trudeau says they've a good relationship In response, Mr Trump said of Mr Trudeau: ""He's two-faced... I find him to be a nice guy, but the truth is I called him out on the fact that he's not paying 2% [of national GDP towards defence] and I guess he's not very happy about it. ""He's not paying 2% and he should be paying 2%. Canada - they have money. Look, I'm representing the US and he should be paying more than he's paying, he understands it... I can imagine he's not that happy but that's the way it is."" Asked about the video, Mr Johnson told reporters: ""It's complete nonsense. I don't know where that's come from."" Mr Trudeau later told reporters that they hadn't been laughing about Mr Trump's press conference, but about the location of the next G7 summit - Camp David, the US presidential country retreat. ""I have a very good relationship with Trump,"" he added. In the statement, Nato leaders said: ""To stay secure we must look to the future together."" It then acknowledged the ""challenges"" posed by China and Russia, and pledged to take ""stronger action"" against terrorism. This video can not be played Feuds reunited? The rifts behind Nato's big birthday Although the 29-member bloc's future is not in doubt, there are disagreements over Turkey's recent military action in northern Syria; the levels of military spending by members; and recent comments by Mr Macron that the alliance is ""brain dead"". Despite the divisions,Mr Johnson - the host of the event - described Nato as a ""giant shield of solidarity""that ""protects nearly a billion people"", saying at the start of the meeting at a luxury resort in Watford: ""As long as we stand together, no-one can hope to defeat us."" This video can not be played Boris Johnson tells fellow Nato leaders: ""Peace cannot be taken for granted"" Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg cited increased spending commitments on defence by European allies and Canada, saying: ""Nato is the most successful alliance in history because we've changed as the world has changed."" On Tuesday, he said those nations had added $130bn (Â£100bn) to defence budgets since 2016, and that this number would increase to $400bn by 2024. Mr Trump has frequently and forcefully criticised how much other allies spend on defence. The first day of the special anniversary summit saw tensions bubble to the surface, with Mr Trump and Mr Macronsparring over Nato's role, Turkey, and Islamic State group (IS) fightersduring a news conference. Relations between the two leaders were already strained amida dispute over taxes and trade, and comments from the French president last month that the US commitment to the alliance was fading. Troubled Nato not in party mood In pictures: 70 years of Nato What does the US do for Nato? Mr Trump, who once called Nato ""obsolete"", had earlier hit back by saying Mr Macron had been ""very disrespectful"" by describing Nato as ""brain dead"", calling them ""nasty"" comments. Mr Macron said he stood by his remarks. President Trump and Mr Johnson held unscheduled bilateral talks and, ahead of Wednesday's talks, Mr Trump tweeted they both had ""talked about numerous subjects including Nato and trade"". Nato, the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, started out in 1949 with just 12 countries as members but having now expanded to a bloc of 29, it is increasingly difficult for the alliance to project a united front. Nato estimates for 2019 show there are now eight countries - in addition to the US - meeting the target agreed by all members to spend 2% or more of their gross domestic product (GDP, a measure of economic output) on defence. Nato leaders attended a reception hosted by the Queen and Prince of Wales on Tuesday Before departing for London,Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan also said he would oppose a Nato defence planfor the Baltic region and Poland if the bloc did not support Turkey over its fight against Kurdish groups in Syria it considers terrorists. Mr Stoltenberg later told reporters that the alliance had been able to resolve the disagreement with Turkey, allowing Nato's plans to go ahead. The Queen talks to President Trump and his wife Melania during Tuesday's reception As well as the Turkish issue, talks had centred on the rising threats of China and Russia. After the summit, Mr Macron said that while Russia was a threat to Nato in some respects, in others the country could be a ""partner"". ""Around the table, would everyone recognise Russia as an enemy? I don't think that is the case,"" he told a news conference. ""On some topics Russia is seen as a threat, this is true... But Russia is also a partner in some issues. We're working and having concrete discussions with Russia on certain issues.""

"The story centred around a call between Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky and US President Donald Trump You may have heard this one before: a controversy involving a foreign power that threatened the future of the Trump presidency. Donald Trump was impeached over allegations he improperly sought help from Ukraine to boost his chances of re-election. In the end, he was cleared on two charges by a majority of senators at this trial. How did we get here? Let's break it down. President Trump was accused of breaking the law by pressuring Ukraine's leader to dig up damaging information on a political rival. In July 2019, he urged his Ukrainian counterpart to investigate one of the frontrunners to take him on in the 2020 presidential election. This mattered, opposition Democrats said, because it is illegal to ask foreign entities for help in winning a US election. He says he has done nothing wrong. After Mr Trump was impeached in December, a trial took place that could have led to the president being removed. In the end, he was cleared. At the heart of this story was a complaint from an unknown whistleblower. In August 2019, an anonymous intelligence official wrote a letter expressing concern over President Trump's 25 July phone conversation with Ukraine's president. The official spoke of an ""urgent concern"" that Mr Trump had used his office to ""solicit interference from a foreign country"" in the 2020 election. Who's who in Trump whistleblower story? What Trump's Ukraine phone call really means A rough transcript of the call,externallater revealed Mr Trump had urged President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former US Vice-President Joe Biden, the frontrunner to take on Mr Trump in the 2020 election, as well as Mr Biden's son. The call came shortly after Mr Trump had blocked the release of military aid to Ukraine. A senior official later testified the president had made clear the release of this aid was conditional on Mr Biden being investigated. The White House denies this. This video can not be played What we know about Biden-Ukraine corruption claims Mr Trump and his supporters alleged Mr Biden abused his power to pressure Ukraine to back away from a criminal investigation that could implicate his son, Hunter, who worked for a Ukrainian energy company. But these allegations were widely discredited. There is no evidence that Mr Biden took any action to intentionally benefit his son, nor is there any evidence of wrongdoing by Hunter Biden. Congressional Democrats said the phone call was proof Mr Trump broke the law by seeking foreign help to try to smear Mr Biden. But there was debate over whether soliciting opposition research from a foreign government constituted an impeachable offence. President Trump says it's a ""witch hunt"". The Democrat-held House of Representatives impeached him on two charges - abuse of power and the obstruction of Congress. But to remove Mr Trump, senators from his own Republican Party would have needed to turn against him at his trial, which didn't happen. President Trump says he called his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky on 25 July 2019 to congratulate him on his election victory. Mr Zelensky, a former TV star with no political experience, had been elected president three months earlier. But an anonymous whistleblower, reported to be a CIA official, felt there was something more serious in their exchange, and explained why in a formal complaint on 12 August. The whistleblower admitted having not directly heard the call but said accounts shared by other officials had painted a consistent picture. For context, about a dozen people are reported to have listened in on the conversation, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. The call occurred days after Mr Trump blocked $391m (Â£316m) in military aid to Ukraine. Critics argued this was used as a bargaining chip, but Mr Trump denied this. This video can not be played Trump: ""It's a partisan whistleblower"" The whistleblower alleged the president used ""the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country"" in the 2020 presidential election, adding that White House officials were ""deeply disturbed"" by the call and had acted to ""lock down"" all details of it. As the controversy grew, Mr Trump promised to release a ""complete, fully declassified and unredacted transcript"" he said would prove the call had been ""totally appropriate"". But details disclosed by the White House were notes of the conversation and not a full, verbatim account. It did little to quell the spiralling controversy. The notes showed Mr Trump had urged Mr Zelensky to investigate discredited corruption allegations against former Vice-President Joe Biden, a frontrunner for the Democratic presidential nomination in the 2020 election, as well as Mr Biden's son. Mr Trump and his allies suggested that Mr Biden, as Barack Obama's vice-president, encouraged the firing of Ukraine's top prosecutor in 2015 because he had been investigating an energy company which employed Hunter Biden. At the time, by working closely with foreign-owned entities while his father was in the White House, Hunter Biden was criticised for leaving his father exposed to suggestions of a possible conflict of interest. But no evidence emerged that Mr Biden did anything to intentionally benefit his son. Hunter Biden denied wrongdoing and officials in Kiev said there was no evidence to support the allegations. Then-President Barack Obama sits with then Vice-President Joe Biden and his son Hunter at a basketball game in 2010 Mr Trump pressing a foreign leader to investigate discredited allegations against Mr Biden was significant. If he wins the Democratic nomination, Mr Biden would be the man facing Mr Trump for the presidency in November 2020. As Mr Biden is a leading rival for the presidency, it opened Mr Trump up to claims he was working with a foreign power to influence the election. This - crucially - is against the law. This was not the first time Mr Trump has been scrutinised over his foreign connections. His 2016 election campaign was investigated over its alleged ties to Russia. The inquiry didn't establish a criminal conspiracy to influence the election, but it also didn't exonerate the president of obstructing justice. The Democrats launched a formal inquiry into the Ukraine affair and a number of officials were called to testify. They included the US government's special envoy to Ukraine, Kurt Volker, who turned over a trove of text messages and other communications. Who listens in on a president's phone call? Ukraine has 'no jurisdiction' to investigate Bidens How easy is it to impeach a president? The acting ambassador to Ukraine, Bill Taylor, told the inquiry that Mr Trump had made the release of the military aid conditional on Ukraine opening an investigation into the Bidens' dealings. He also said there was ""an irregular, informal channel of US policymaking"" in the country more generally. The White House denied this was the case. The president's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, was subpoenaed for documents relating to Ukraine. He has been central in pushing the allegations against the Bidens. Mr Pompeo has also been served with a subpoena. But the most dramatic testimony came from Gordon Sondland, the US ambassador to the European Union. He told Congress that he was working at the ""express direction"" of the president when pressure was put on Ukraine to investigate the Bidens. Mr Sondland added that an offer of a White House visit for Ukraine's president was conditional on the country publicly announcing a probe. He also implicated Mr Pompeo and former National Security Adviser John Bolton in the Ukraine dealings. In December, Democratic leaders in the US House of Representatives unveiled two impeachment charges - abuse of power and the obstruction of Congress. Then, a week before Christmas, the House voted to impeach Mr Trump, ensuring he became only the third US president to suffer the same fate (after Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton). Over two weeks in January and February 2020, the Senate held a trial. A Senate vote requires a two-thirds majority to convict, so a guilty verdict was always unlikely given that Mr Trump's party controls the chamber. And this is how it came to pass. Mr Trump was cleared - by 52 votes to 48 on one count, and 53 votes to 47 on the other.

"This video can not be played A beginner's guide to impeachment and Trump US President Donald Trump has been impeached and now faces the next stage of a process that could, with enough support in Congress, see him removed from office. It all centres on whether or not he improperly sought help from Ukraine to boost his chances of re-election in 2020. Mr Trump became only the third president in US history to be impeached after two votes in the Democratic Party-controlled House of Representatives - but more on what that means below. President Trump, who is a Republican, strongly denies any wrongdoing. President Trump is accused of pressuring Ukraine to dig up damaging information on one of his main Democratic challengers for the presidency in 2020, Joe Biden, and his son Hunter. Hunter worked for a Ukrainian company when Joe Biden was US vice-president. The president is accused of dangling two things as bargaining chips to Ukraine - withholding $400m of military aid to Ukraine that had already been allocated by Congress, and a White House meeting for Ukraine's president. This, Democrats say, amounts to an abuse of presidential power, using the office for personal political gain and to the detriment of national security. Ukraine was using that money in its ongoing conflict with Russia. Mr Trump is also accused of obstructing Congress by refusing to co-operate with the congressional inquiry. A formal complaint from a whistleblower - an unnamed intelligence official who wrote a letter expressing concern about Mr Trump's 25 July call with President Volodymyr Zelensky - kicked off the impeachment process in early September. A rough transcript of the call,externalrevealed that Mr Trump had urged President Zelensky to investigate discredited allegations against Joe and Hunter Biden. This video can not be played What we know about Biden-Ukraine corruption claims The call came shortly after Mr Trump had blocked the release of millions of dollars in US military aid to Ukraine.A senior official later testifiedthat the president made clear the release of the aid was conditional on Mr Biden being investigated, but the White House denies this. In a series of public hearings, a procession of US officials have testified that there was a White House shadow foreign policy led by the president's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani. Its aim was to get Ukraine to open an investigation into the Bidens and declare as much publicly. Mr Trump denies using US military aid as a bargaining chip with Mr Zelensky and has repeatedly insisted his call with Ukraine's leader was ""perfect"". He has called the impeachment inquiry a ""witch hunt"" by Democrats and elements of the media. He also says it was appropriate to ask Ukraine to investigate ""corruption"", referring to the energy firm where Hunter Biden worked. The Republican defence comes in three parts: - Ukraine's president said he felt no pressure - The Ukrainians were unaware the aid was held back - US military aid was eventually released To impeach, in this context, means to bring charges in Congress that will form the basis for a trial. The US constitution states a president ""shall be removed from office on impeachment for, and conviction of, treason, bribery, or other high crimes or misdemeanours"". It's important to note this is a political process, rather than a criminal one. This video can not be played What does it take to impeach a president? It happens in two stages. The first stage is done now - two articles of impeachment (charges) were brought to the House of Representatives and passed in a vote along party lines. Next the process heads to the Senate where a trial will be held in January. But here, a two-thirds vote is necessary for a president's removal - and this milestone has never been reached in US history. The Senate is currently controlled by the Republican Party so conviction is considered unlikely in Trump's case. Bill Clinton found himself impeached on the grounds of perjury and obstruction of justice after he lied about the nature of his affair with Monica Lewinsky and then allegedly asked her to lie about it as well. But when the trial reached the Senate in 1999, the vote for a conviction failed to get close to the two-thirds backing required. Bill and Hillary Clinton with US House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt after Mr Clinton was impeached The only other president impeached was Andrew Johnson in 1868. He was accused of, among other things, dismissing his secretary of war against the will of Congress. Mr Johnson had a narrow escape - the two-thirds majority in the Senate was missed by just one vote. President Andrew Johnson narrowly survived his impeachment trial Richard Nixon, the 37th US president, resigned in 1974 before he could be impeached over the Watergate scandal. The line of succession for the US government, as established by the Presidential Succession Act of 1947, would mean Vice-President Mike Pence moving into the Oval Office.
