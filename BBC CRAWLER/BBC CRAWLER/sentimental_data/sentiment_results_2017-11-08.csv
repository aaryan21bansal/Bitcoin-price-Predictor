By John Sudworth, BBC News, Beijing So the world's first and second most powerful men have met in Beijing. But which one's which? Side by side, as presidents Trump and Xi stood for photographs at Beijing's Forbidden City, some might wonder. Mr Trump is seen as weakened at home, beset by scandal and a faltering agenda, and disengaged abroad. Mr Xi is being hailed as the most powerful leader since Chairman Mao, with a vision for Chinese leadership on the global stage. And while the US president comes here expecting much - help with North Korea, action to reduce the trade deficit - China seems to be seeking little, except in one broad sense. State media is talking about a ""new chapter of history"" based on a ""major-power relationship"". It's not about first or second place any more, it's about parity of esteem. With a ""transactional"" US president, less prone to talk about US values, China senses that time may have come. Hours earlier, in the South Korean capital Seoul, Mr Trump described North Korea as ""a hell that no person deserves"". North Korea's nuclear weapons programme has sparked international alarm, with Pyongyang carrying out its biggest nuclear test yet in September. In typically stark language, Mr Trump warned the North: ""Do not underestimate us. Do not try us."" But there were hints though he might be open to a deal, telling the North ""we will offer you a path for a better future"". Singling out Russia and China, he urged ""all responsible nations"" to isolate the North, and fully implement UN sanctions, downgrade diplomatic ties and sever trade and technology ties. This video can not be played Trump to N Korea: 'Your weapons are not making you safer' ""You cannot support, you cannot supply, you cannot accept,"" he said. China is North Korea's largest trading partner and only major ally, but says it is committed to the UN sanctions and argues its leverage has been overestimated. Despite having congratulated Mr Xi on his political ascendency, Mr Trump has been a vocal critic over what he sees as unfair Chinese trade practices. During his presidential campaign, he called Beijing a currency manipulator and accused it of stealing US jobs. He is expected to seek ways to reduce what he has called the ""embarrassing"" US trade deficit with China. China has been keen to give Mr Trump a generous welcome US and Chinese firms have already signed $9bn (Â£6.9bn) in deals as part of the visit. There have been questions over whether Mr Trump would use his favoured communications platform Twitter while in China, where it is banned. But a White House official has said ""the president will tweet whatever he wants"". Mr Trump is in China as part of a five-nation tour of Asia. He has also visited Japan so far and will go on to Vietnam and the Philippines.

"Randhawa was arrested after the NCA replaced his intended package with a dummy device A teenager has been convicted of trying to import explosives from thedark webwith intent to endanger life. Gurtej Singh Randhawa, from Wolverhampton, attempted to buy a vehicle-borne improvised explosive device, which would be sent to him. The 19-year old was arrested in May 2017 after the National Crime Agency (NCA) replaced the package with a dummy device before it was delivered. He was found guilty on Tuesday after a trial at Birmingham Crown Court.

"This video can not be played Carl Sargeant ""wasn't dealt with fairly"", says Labour AM Jenny Rathbone The family of sacked Welsh Labour minister Carl Sargeant has said he was deprived of ""natural justice"". He was found dead on Tuesday after being sacked from the cabinet and suspended from Labour. He faced allegations of ""unwanted attention, inappropriate touching or groping"". Leighton Andrews, a former key ally of Carwyn Jones, said he is ""angry"" the first minister did TV interviews commenting on allegations. The former AM and cabinet minister said Mr Jones had not followed ""due process"" by speaking to the media on Monday. On Thursday Labour AMs will meet for the first time since Mr Sargeant died. First Minister Carwyn Jones's spokesman said: ""Like everyone in the Welsh Labour family Carwyn is deeply upset by the death of his friend. ""Tomorrow Welsh Labour AMs will meet in the assembly to remember Carl and discuss the tragic events of the past week. Carwyn will make a further statement following the meeting."" Sacked Labour minister found dead Profile of long-serving AM's career Ex-minister 'facing number of claims' Minister removed over conduct claims On Monday Mr Jones told the BBC and ITV there were ""a number"" of allegations made by women against Mr Sargeant. But Mr Andrews told BBC One's Wales Live programmethat he felt the first minister should not have made any public comments after the matter was referred to the Labour Party on Friday. ""Having passed this over on Friday to the Labour party, on Monday the first minister is doing interviews with the BBC and I think with ITV as well in which he is elaborating on the story and commenting on the story,"" he said. ""Well, that is not due process. ""I'm very angry at those interviews on Monday and the anger within the Labour Party across Wales and beyond the Labour Party in Carl's local community, people in other political parties, people in no political party. ""People do not think Carl Sargeant has been treated fairly."" This video can not be played Leighton Andrews said the allegations should have been dealt with ""behind closed doors"" His comments came after Mr Sargeant's family released correspondence between his solicitor and Labour to highlight their concern over his treatment. It shows Mr Sargeant pushed for more specific details on the claims, and that his mental well-being was being affected. Relatives said he was distressed at being unable to defend himself. The Labour Party said that, in line with agreed procedure, the nature of the allegations was outlined to Mr Sargeant. The Alyn and Deeside AM had vowed to clear his name after being sacked as communities secretary by Mr Jones on Friday, but said he did not know the details of the allegations. It is understood he took his own life. A family spokesman said on Wednesday they were publishing the correspondence ""in light of the continued unwillingness"" of the Labour Party ""to clarify the nature of the allegations made against Carl"". ""Up to the point of his tragic death on Tuesday morning Carl was not informed of any of the detail of the allegations against him, despite requests and warnings regarding his mental welfare,"" the spokesman said. ""The correspondence also discloses the solicitor's concern that media appearances by the first minister on Monday were prejudicing the inquiry. ""The family wish to disclose the fact that Carl maintained his innocence and he categorically denied any wrongdoing. ""The distress of not being able to defend himself properly against these unspecified allegations meant he was not afforded common courtesy, decency or natural justice."" In a statement through solicitors later, the family added that they hope ""there will be a full investigation and scrutiny of the way that the relevant parties concerned dealt with the allegations, Mr Sargeant personally and the statements that have been made in the press and media"". ""Those that owed a clear duty of care to Carl and to his family will, no doubt in due course, need to provide clarity on their respective positions in this tragedy,"" they added. ""No support was offered to Mr Sargeant other than that personally offered by close friends and family,"" the family added. Carl Sargeant's family have released two emails and a letter sent between his solicitor and Welsh Labour. It includes: An email from his solicitor that alleges First Minister Carwyn Jones prejudiced ""what is allegedly an independent enquiry"" by Labour A letter that said he was accused of ""unwanted attention, inappropriate touching or groping"" - allegations Mr Sargeant had denied Read the correspondencehere This video can not be played MP Mark Tami says if procedures were followed in the run-up to Carl Sargeant's death something had gone ""badly wrong"" Mr Sargeant's Westminster constituency colleague, Labour MP Mark Tami, said Mr Sargeant's family were ""angry"" because ""they obviously have questions about the process and how it has ended up with this"". ""I think they need some space to try as best they can to come to terms with what has happened to Carl,"" he said. ""If the procedure's been followed then we need to look at the procedure because something's gone badly wrong."" The first minister is facing questions from within his own party about how the situation was handled, after finding out about the allegations early last week. Staff from his office, but not civil servants, spoke to the women involved and referred their complaints to Welsh Labour, which was investigating, and suspended Mr Sargeant. Allow Twitter content?

Jenny Rathbone, Labour AM for Cardiff Central, said she felt Mr Sargeant ""wasn't dealt with fairly"". ""If allegations are made against you, you must know what they are so that you can respond to them,"" she said on BBC Radio Wales' Good Morning Wales programme. UKIP Wales leader Neil Hamilton called on Mr Jones to resign, saying he ""failed to fulfil his duty of care"" to Mr Sargeant. Brecon and Radnorshire Conservative MP Chris Davies also called on the first minister to resign, saying the way he had handled the matter was ""terrible"". What did Carwyn Jones know about allegations of misconduct against Carl Sargeant - and when? In a television interview two days ago, the day before the death of the ex-cabinet secretary, Carwyn Jones insisted that the first time he heard of the allegations was last week. But multiple sources from more than one party have told me that Carwyn Jones had discussed allegations of misconduct with Carl Sargeant once before, and had received an explanation of the incident. Are the sources right? The simple answer is I do not know. But Carwyn Jones knows the truth and he should answer the question as soon as possible. More from Vaughan A book of condolence for Mr Sargeant was opened in the assembly on Wednesday A Labour Party spokesman said: ""Following allegations brought to the attention of Welsh Labour by Welsh First Minister Carwyn Jones, an investigation was launched by the UK party. ""The Labour Party Governance and Legal Unit spoke with Carl Sargeant and, in line with agreed procedure, outlined the nature of the allegations that had been received and how the complaints process works.""

By John Sudworth, BBC News, Beijing So the world's first and second most powerful men have met in Beijing. But which one's which? Side by side, as presidents Trump and Xi stood for photographs at Beijing's Forbidden City, some might wonder. Mr Trump is seen as weakened at home, beset by scandal and a faltering agenda, and disengaged abroad. Mr Xi is being hailed as the most powerful leader since Chairman Mao, with a vision for Chinese leadership on the global stage. And while the US president comes here expecting much - help with North Korea, action to reduce the trade deficit - China seems to be seeking little, except in one broad sense. State media is talking about a ""new chapter of history"" based on a ""major-power relationship"". It's not about first or second place any more, it's about parity of esteem. With a ""transactional"" US president, less prone to talk about US values, China senses that time may have come. Hours earlier, in the South Korean capital Seoul, Mr Trump described North Korea as ""a hell that no person deserves"". North Korea's nuclear weapons programme has sparked international alarm, with Pyongyang carrying out its biggest nuclear test yet in September. In typically stark language, Mr Trump warned the North: ""Do not underestimate us. Do not try us."" But there were hints though he might be open to a deal, telling the North ""we will offer you a path for a better future"". Singling out Russia and China, he urged ""all responsible nations"" to isolate the North, and fully implement UN sanctions, downgrade diplomatic ties and sever trade and technology ties. This video can not be played Trump to N Korea: 'Your weapons are not making you safer' ""You cannot support, you cannot supply, you cannot accept,"" he said. China is North Korea's largest trading partner and only major ally, but says it is committed to the UN sanctions and argues its leverage has been overestimated. Despite having congratulated Mr Xi on his political ascendency, Mr Trump has been a vocal critic over what he sees as unfair Chinese trade practices. During his presidential campaign, he called Beijing a currency manipulator and accused it of stealing US jobs. He is expected to seek ways to reduce what he has called the ""embarrassing"" US trade deficit with China.

"This video can not be played Air Force One arrives in the Chinese capital Beijing US President Donald Trump is in China for talks likely to be dominated by tensions over North Korea. His arrival came after a speech to the South Korean parliament in which Mr Trump urged China to further isolate North Korea. The White House sees China as pivotal in reining in the North's nuclear aims but Beijing says it is doing enough. Chinese President Xi Jinping gave a lavish welcome to Mr Trump in what has been called a ""state visit-plus"". How Trump's Asia trip will unfold Trump vs Xi: The two men compared Before his visit, Mr Trump piled praise on Mr Xi, saying he was looking forward to meeting the Chinese president after ""his great political victory"". Mr Xi recently consolidated his powerat a Chinese Communist Party congress, a move analysts say will make him less likely to reach compromise with Mr Trump. This video can not be played The BBC asked Chinese citizens to describe America in one phrase A red carpet, military band and flag-waving children met Mr Trump and his wife Melania when they arrived in Beijing. By contrast,when Barack Obama visited Chinaduring the final weeks of his presidency there was no red carpet, in what was seen as a calculated snub. Mr Trump and First Lady Melania Trump then visited the Forbidden City, for centuries the home of China's emperors, followed by afternoon tea. Mr Trump, Mr Xi and their wives watched an opera performance at the Forbidden City.... ... there was a chance for Mr Trump to meet some of the performers afterwards Chinese state media said Mr Trump showed Mr Xi a video of his granddaughter Arabella singing in Mandarin, with Mr Xi describing the recital as worthy of an ""A+"". The Trumps, along with Mr Xi and his wife, were due to dine inside the Forbidden City in what CNN says is an unprecedented honour for a US president. Later Mr Trump tweeted his thanks to the Chinese leader for ""an unforgettable afternoon and evening"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

By John Sudworth, BBC News, Beijing So the world's first and second most powerful men have met in Beijing. But which one's which? Side by side, as presidents Trump and Xi stood for photographs at Beijing's Forbidden City, some might wonder. Mr Trump is seen as weakened at home, beset by scandal and a faltering agenda, and disengaged abroad. Mr Xi is being hailed as the most powerful leader since Chairman Mao, with a vision for Chinese leadership on the global stage. And while the US president comes here expecting much - help with North Korea, action to reduce the trade deficit - China seems to be seeking little, except in one broad sense. State media is talking about a ""new chapter of history"" based on a ""major-power relationship"". It's not about first or second place any more, it's about parity of esteem. With a ""transactional"" US president, less prone to talk about US values, China senses that time may have come. Hours earlier, in the South Korean capital Seoul, Mr Trump described North Korea as ""a hell that no person deserves"". North Korea's nuclear weapons programme has sparked international alarm, with Pyongyang carrying out its biggest nuclear test yet in September. In typically stark language, Mr Trump warned the North: ""Do not underestimate us. Do not try us."" But there were hints though he might be open to a deal, telling the North ""we will offer you a path for a better future"". Singling out Russia and China, he urged ""all responsible nations"" to isolate the North, and fully implement UN sanctions, downgrade diplomatic ties and sever trade and technology ties. This video can not be played Trump to N Korea: 'Your weapons are not making you safer' ""You cannot support, you cannot supply, you cannot accept,"" he said. China is North Korea's largest trading partner and only major ally, but says it is committed to the UN sanctions and argues its leverage has been overestimated. Despite having congratulated Mr Xi on his political ascendency, Mr Trump has been a vocal critic over what he sees as unfair Chinese trade practices. During his presidential campaign, he called Beijing a currency manipulator and accused it of stealing US jobs. He is expected to seek ways to reduce what he has called the ""embarrassing"" US trade deficit with China. China has been keen to give Mr Trump a generous welcome US and Chinese firms have already signed $9bn (Â£6.9bn) in deals as part of the visit. There have been questions over whether Mr Trump would use his favoured communications platform Twitter while in China, where it is banned. But a White House official has said ""the president will tweet whatever he wants"". Mr Trump is in China as part of a five-nation tour of Asia. He has also visited Japan so far and will go on to Vietnam and the Philippines.

"Mark van Dongen died 15 months after being attacked in Bristol An acid attack victim has told jurors, in testimony recorded before his death, how the ""jealous"" ex accused of his murder laughed as she doused him in a corrosive liquid. In video evidence, Mark van Dongen, 29, said Berlinah Wallace, 48, shouted ""if I can't have you, no-one else can"" as she threw sulphuric acid at him. Bristol Crown Court heard he ended his life in a euthanasia clinic due to unbearable pain from his injuries. Ms Wallace denies murder. The court heard Dutch national Mr van Dongen was left paralysed from the neck down and lost his left leg, the sight in his left eye and most of the sight in his right eye, after the September 2015 attack in Bristol. He was later told he would require a ""lifetime of constant and dedicated care"". In January this year, he travelled to Belgium where he ended his life in a euthanasia clinic. A picture of Mark van Dongen taken before the attack Jurors were shown the video interview with Mr van Dongen, filmed in hospital in July 2016, where he gave his account of the attack, Trial judge Mrs Justice May warned them they may find the footage, which showed the extent of the scarring to the victim's body, ""shocking and disturbing"". In the video, Mr van Dongen struggles to speak as he describes Ms Wallace waking him up and laughing as she threw acid over him, saying ""if I can't have you, no one else can"". When the interviewer asks if he knew why she had attacked him, he says it was because she was jealous. In a second video shown to the court, Mr van Dongen tells police Ms Wallace threw boiling water over him after an argument in 2014. He also says Ms Wallace hit herself in the face, and told him she would tell police he had caused her injuries if he left her. At the time of the attack, prosecutor Adam Vaitilingam QC told jurors, Mr van Dongen had begun seeing another woman and moved into a hotel. The victim visited the defendant at her flat in Ladysmith Road, Bristol, because he was concerned that she was ""in a bad way and self-harming"", the court was told. He fell asleep, jurors heard, and Ms Wallace laughed as she threw a glass of sulphuric acid over him. The court heard Mr van Dongen ran into the street ""screaming for help"", where neighbours tried to help him, and he was taken to a specialist burns unit at Southmead Hospital. Mr Vaitilingam said: ""The physical and mental suffering that he sustained from that calculated acid attack were what drove him to euthanasia. ""Put simply, he could not bear to live in that condition. ""If that is right, we say, then she is guilty of murder."" Ms Wallace wept in the dock as the jury were told Mr van Dongen was ""genuinely frightened"" of her, and the couple's relationship had become ""volatile"". Berlinah Wallace denies murder and applying a corrosive substance The jury heard computer records showed Ms Wallace had bought the acid online on 2 September. She also carried out internet searches, including ""can I die drinking sulphuric acid?"", and browsed news stories on acid attack victims. Ms Wallace admits throwing a substance over Mr van Dongen but denies any intent to cause him harm. She claims she believed that she was throwing a glass of water over him. Richard Smith QC, defending, told the jury ""to keep an open mind"". ""Yes, she threw the glass over him, but defence claims Mr van Dongen put the acid in the cup without her knowledge, and encouraged her to drink it resulting in a mirror image of what we now have."" He said the couple had a ""turbulent and complicated relationship"" and Ms Wallace was going to blackmail Mr van Dongen with personal information, which was why he put the acid in the glass and encouraged her to drink it. Ms Wallace denies murder and applying a corrosive substance. The trial continues on Thursday.

"Artwork: The ""zombie"" star kept erupting for nearly two years It's the astronomical equivalent of a horror film adversary: a star that just wouldn't stay dead. When most stars go supernova, they die in a single blast, but astronomers have found a star that survived not one, but five separate explosions. The ""zombie"" star kept erupting for nearly two years - six times longer than the duration of a typical supernova. An international team details their resultsin the academic journal Nature,external. ""This supernova breaks everything we thought we knew about how they work. It's the biggest puzzle I've encountered in almost a decade of studying stellar explosions,"" said co-author Iair Arcavi, a postdoctoral fellow at Las Cumbres Observatory (LCO) who is based in California. The mysterious object, iPTF14hls, was picked up in September 2014 by a wide-field camera astronomy survey. Astronomers identified it as an exploding star in January 2015; everything about the discovery seemed normal at first. In common types of supernova, a blast at the centre of the star ejects material at high speed into surrounding space. The expansion of this material releases energy, causing the object to shine brightly for up to 100 days (about four months) before it finally fades. It soon became clear this exploding star wasn't conforming to expectations. For one thing, it didn't fade, but shone brightly for 600 days - nearly two years. What's more, the astronomers found that its brightness varied by as much as 50% on an irregular timescale, as if it was exploding over and over again. And, rather than cooling down as expected, the object maintained a near-constant temperature of about 5,700C. Intriguingly, by combing through archived data, scientists discovered an explosion that occurred in 1954 in exactly the same location. This could suggest that the star somehow survived that explosion, only to detonate again in 2014. The object may be the first known example of a Pulsational Pair Instability Supernova. ""According to this theory, it is possible that this was the result of a star so massive and hot that it generated antimatter in its core,"" said co-author Daniel Kasen, from the University of California, Berkeley. ""That would cause the star to go violently unstable, and undergo repeated bright eruptions over periods of years."" That process could even repeat itself over decades before the star's final explosion and collapse to a black hole. The discovery was made by the Intermediate Palomar Transient Factory (iPTF) wide-field camera survey Kate Maguire, from Queen's University Belfast, who was not involved with the study, told BBC News: ""It's a theoretical idea that people have put forward, but this is the first time that an object has been identified that matches this quite well. ""It's quite unusual."" Writing in a news and views article published in Nature, Prof Stan Woosley, from the University of California, Santa Cruz, said that in the Pulsational Pair Instability theory, a massive star may lose about half its mass before the series of violent pulses begins. Not everything we know about the ""zombie"" matches this theory, Prof Woosley added, and many uncertainties remain. ""As of now, no detailed model has been published that can explain the observed emission and constant temperature of iPTF14hls, let alone the possible eruption 60 years ago,"" he wrote. ""For now, the supernova offers astronomers their greatest thrill: something they do not understand.""

"Passengers queue to get on to a Greater Anglia service train Five rail operators have experienced disruption due to strike action by the Rail, Maritime and Transport union. Workers on Southern, Greater Anglia and South Western Railway are striking for 48 hours, while staff on Merseyrail and Northern walked out for 24 hours. The union is in dispute over driver-only operated (DOO) trains, also known as driver-controlled operated (DCO). Aslef, which has also been in dispute with Southern,announced on Wednesday that train drivers had accepted a deal. It means there will be a second safety-trained person on every DOO train, except in exceptional circumstances, gives drivers a five-year pay deal worth 28.5%, and confirms the terms and conditions under which members are employed. The executive committee of the train drivers' union had recommended its members accept the deal, which has no impact on the RMT's continuing industrial action. The RMT described Aslef's deal with Southern as ""shoddy"". Commuters ride a crowded South Western Railway train on the Portsmouth to London line Members of the RMT union, who are mostly conductors, have held a series of strikes on Southern since April 2016 amid concerns over safety and job losses. Changes were introduced on Southern in January making conductors ""on-board supervisors"" and passing responsibility for closing doors to drivers. Industrial action by RMT members has only recently spread to other routes across England. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Southern had said services on most of its routes would operate normally during the 48-hour strike although there would besome alterations,external. However, signalling problems exacerbated changes and led to delays and cancellations during people's commute on Wednesday morning. There were also delays due to trespassers on the line between East Croyden and Clapham and lines between Worthing and Bright were blocked during the evening after a person was hit by a train.

Greater Anglia had said it wouldrun a full service,externalduring the industrial action, using other trained staff in place of conductors. Its plan was approved on Tuesday by the Office of Rail and Road (ORR), which criticised the company's contingency arrangements during a strike last month following an incident in which thedoors on the wrong side of a train were openedat Ipswich station.

A spokeswoman said only ""a handful"" of services had been disrupted due to the strike. South Western Railway (SWR), which only took over the franchise from South West Trains in August, cancelled about 40% of its services. It published acontingency timetable,externalincluding replacement buses on some routes. However, the RMT has voiced its concerns about the various plans. General Secretary Mick Cash said: ""The only way that Greater Anglia can be running these services is through taking serious risks with public safety just as they did during the last phase of strike action. ""Rail companies are training up rail staff who have previously had no rail operational experience to stand in as highly trained guards. ""In some cases staff are being bussed in by other train companies not involved in the dispute, paid a bounty and put up overnight in hotels."" The RMT union is in dispute over driver-only operated trains, also known as driver-controlled operated trains But Richard Dean, Greater Anglia's train service delivery director, stressed that the ORR was satisfied with its arrangements, and that an independent rail safety expert had  concluded that its stand-in conductor training was ""industry best practice"". ""We will never compromise the safety of our customers,"" Mr Dean added. Merseyrail ran areduced train service,externalacross its network during the 24-hour strike, while Northern ran its lessened service, mostly between 07:00 and 19:00 GMT. A spokesman for the Department for Transport said: ""This dispute is not about jobs or safety - employees have been guaranteed jobs and salaries. In fact at Southern Rail, where these changes have already been introduced, there are now more staff on trains. ""The independent rail regulator has said driver-controlled trains, which have been used in this country for more than 30 years, are safe."" Has your journey been affected by the dispute?

"This video can not be played Carl Sargeant ""wasn't dealt with fairly"", says Labour AM Jenny Rathbone The family of sacked Welsh Labour minister Carl Sargeant has said he was deprived of ""natural justice"". He was found dead on Tuesday after being sacked from the cabinet and suspended from Labour. He faced allegations of ""unwanted attention, inappropriate touching or groping"". Leighton Andrews, a former key ally of Carwyn Jones, said he is ""angry"" the first minister did TV interviews commenting on allegations. The former AM and cabinet minister said Mr Jones had not followed ""due process"" by speaking to the media on Monday. On Thursday Labour AMs will meet for the first time since Mr Sargeant died. First Minister Carwyn Jones's spokesman said: ""Like everyone in the Welsh Labour family Carwyn is deeply upset by the death of his friend. ""Tomorrow Welsh Labour AMs will meet in the assembly to remember Carl and discuss the tragic events of the past week. Carwyn will make a further statement following the meeting."" Sacked Labour minister found dead Profile of long-serving AM's career Ex-minister 'facing number of claims' Minister removed over conduct claims On Monday Mr Jones told the BBC and ITV there were ""a number"" of allegations made by women against Mr Sargeant. But Mr Andrews told BBC One's Wales Live programmethat he felt the first minister should not have made any public comments after the matter was referred to the Labour Party on Friday. ""Having passed this over on Friday to the Labour party, on Monday the first minister is doing interviews with the BBC and I think with ITV as well in which he is elaborating on the story and commenting on the story,"" he said. ""Well, that is not due process. ""I'm very angry at those interviews on Monday and the anger within the Labour Party across Wales and beyond the Labour Party in Carl's local community, people in other political parties, people in no political party. ""People do not think Carl Sargeant has been treated fairly."" This video can not be played Leighton Andrews said the allegations should have been dealt with ""behind closed doors"" His comments came after Mr Sargeant's family released correspondence between his solicitor and Labour to highlight their concern over his treatment. It shows Mr Sargeant pushed for more specific details on the claims, and that his mental well-being was being affected. Relatives said he was distressed at being unable to defend himself. The Labour Party said that, in line with agreed procedure, the nature of the allegations was outlined to Mr Sargeant. The Alyn and Deeside AM had vowed to clear his name after being sacked as communities secretary by Mr Jones on Friday, but said he did not know the details of the allegations. It is understood he took his own life. A family spokesman said on Wednesday they were publishing the correspondence ""in light of the continued unwillingness"" of the Labour Party ""to clarify the nature of the allegations made against Carl"". ""Up to the point of his tragic death on Tuesday morning Carl was not informed of any of the detail of the allegations against him, despite requests and warnings regarding his mental welfare,"" the spokesman said. ""The correspondence also discloses the solicitor's concern that media appearances by the first minister on Monday were prejudicing the inquiry. ""The family wish to disclose the fact that Carl maintained his innocence and he categorically denied any wrongdoing. ""The distress of not being able to defend himself properly against these unspecified allegations meant he was not afforded common courtesy, decency or natural justice."" In a statement through solicitors later, the family added that they hope ""there will be a full investigation and scrutiny of the way that the relevant parties concerned dealt with the allegations, Mr Sargeant personally and the statements that have been made in the press and media"". ""Those that owed a clear duty of care to Carl and to his family will, no doubt in due course, need to provide clarity on their respective positions in this tragedy,"" they added. ""No support was offered to Mr Sargeant other than that personally offered by close friends and family,"" the family added. Carl Sargeant's family have released two emails and a letter sent between his solicitor and Welsh Labour. It includes: An email from his solicitor that alleges First Minister Carwyn Jones prejudiced ""what is allegedly an independent enquiry"" by Labour A letter that said he was accused of ""unwanted attention, inappropriate touching or groping"" - allegations Mr Sargeant had denied Read the correspondencehere This video can not be played MP Mark Tami says if procedures were followed in the run-up to Carl Sargeant's death something had gone ""badly wrong"" Mr Sargeant's Westminster constituency colleague, Labour MP Mark Tami, said Mr Sargeant's family were ""angry"" because ""they obviously have questions about the process and how it has ended up with this"". ""I think they need some space to try as best they can to come to terms with what has happened to Carl,"" he said. ""If the procedure's been followed then we need to look at the procedure because something's gone badly wrong."" The first minister is facing questions from within his own party about how the situation was handled, after finding out about the allegations early last week. Staff from his office, but not civil servants, spoke to the women involved and referred their complaints to Welsh Labour, which was investigating, and suspended Mr Sargeant. Allow Twitter content?

Jenny Rathbone, Labour AM for Cardiff Central, said she felt Mr Sargeant ""wasn't dealt with fairly"". ""If allegations are made against you, you must know what they are so that you can respond to them,"" she said on BBC Radio Wales' Good Morning Wales programme. UKIP Wales leader Neil Hamilton called on Mr Jones to resign, saying he ""failed to fulfil his duty of care"" to Mr Sargeant. Brecon and Radnorshire Conservative MP Chris Davies also called on the first minister to resign, saying the way he had handled the matter was ""terrible"". What did Carwyn Jones know about allegations of misconduct against Carl Sargeant - and when? In a television interview two days ago, the day before the death of the ex-cabinet secretary, Carwyn Jones insisted that the first time he heard of the allegations was last week. But multiple sources from more than one party have told me that Carwyn Jones had discussed allegations of misconduct with Carl Sargeant once before, and had received an explanation of the incident. Are the sources right? The simple answer is I do not know. But Carwyn Jones knows the truth and he should answer the question as soon as possible. More from Vaughan A book of condolence for Mr Sargeant was opened in the assembly on Wednesday A Labour Party spokesman said: ""Following allegations brought to the attention of Welsh Labour by Welsh First Minister Carwyn Jones, an investigation was launched by the UK party. ""The Labour Party Governance and Legal Unit spoke with Carl Sargeant and, in line with agreed procedure, outlined the nature of the allegations that had been received and how the complaints process works.""

"This video can not be played The Louvre Abu Dhabi opened in November 2017 French President Emmanuel Macron unveiled a Â£1bn newly-built museum in Abu Dhabi on Wednesday. The new Louvre, built over the past 10 years, holds 600 artworks permanently and 300 loaned from France. Praised by critics, the building boasts a latticed dome designed to allow the desert sun to filter through. It holds art and items related to history and religion from around the world and Mr Macron called it a ""bridge between civilisations"". He said: ""Those who seek to say Islam is the destruction of other religions are liars."" The project, agreed between France and Abu Dhabi in 2007, was initially intended to open in 2012 but was delayed by the global financial crisis and plummeting oil prices, sending the final cost soaring over its original $654m (then Â£340m) budget. The Louvre Abu Dhabi is the first project to open in a series which the United Arab Emirates hope will put the city on the cultural map In addition, the museum is paying France hundreds of millions of dollars for the use of the Louvre name and for loans of artworks and managerial advice. The museum has attracted its share of controversy overconcerns about the welfare of the workers constructing the building. But critics have declared the finished building -  the first to open in a series of projects conceived by UAE authorities at creating a cultural oasis on the Abu Dhabi island of Saadiyat -a ""mesmerising"" success, if with a ""touch of bling"",external. The Paris Louvre is a landmark in the French capital and the world's largest art museum, with millions of visitors a year. The Abu Dhabi building, designed by French architect Jean Nouvel, brings to mind an Arab medina (an ancient quarter of a city). None of its 55 rooms, including 23 permanent galleries,  is alike. The latticed dome protects visitors from the scalding heat, while allowing the rooms to glow with natural light. On show are works from around the world - from established European masters including Van Gogh, Gaugin and Picasso, to Americans such as James Abbott McNeill Whistler (his painting Whistler's Mother, above) and the modern Chinese artist Ai Weiwei. The museum has also joined force with Arab institutions who have loaned 28 prized works. Among the priceless artefacts on show are a statue of a sphinx dating back to the 6th Century BC and a frieze depicting figures from the Koran. The museum's doors open to the public on Saturday - with all entrance tickets, priced 60 dirhams ($16.80), sold out. Emirati officials will hope the magnificence of the building will put concerns about the wellbeing of its workers and controversy about delays and overrunning costs in the shade.

Gurtej Singh Randhawa, from Wolverhampton, attempted to buy a vehicle-borne improvised explosive device, which would be sent to him. The 19-year old was arrested in May 2017 after the National Crime Agency (NCA) replaced the package with a dummy device before it was delivered. He was found guilty on Tuesday after a trial at Birmingham Crown Court. Midlands Live: Senior West Midlands Police officer suspended; pregnant woman threatened with 'bloodied' needle Randhawa, of Grove Lane, Tettenhall, who had previously pleaded guilty to attempting to import explosives, was remanded in custody and is due to be sentenced on 12 January. He was convicted of maliciously possessing an explosive substance with intent to endanger life or cause serious injury. This video can not be played Technology explained: What is the dark web? Two women, aged 45 and 18, were also arrested at the same time but were released without charge. Tim Gregory, from the NCA's armed operations unit, said: ""The explosive device Randhawa sought to purchase online had the potential to cause serious damage and kill many people if he had been successful in using it.

"This video can not be played Spain's foreign minister: ""No sympathy"" for Puigdemont The Spanish government will consider holding a nationwide referendum on changing the constitution to allow for legal independence referendums, the foreign minister says. In an interview with the BBC, Alfonso Dastis said the move was in recognition of recent developments in Catalonia. The Catalan government was deposed after a banned referendum and unilateral declaration of independence. Protests were held against the detention of the region's ex-leaders. Spain's constitutional court has ruled that the declaration of independence was ""unconstitutional and void"". ""We have created a committee in parliament to explore the possibility of amending the constitution to be able to accommodate better the aspirations of some of the Catalan people,"" Mr Dastis told the BBC. ""We acknowledge there is a political situation that deserves to be looked at but, in any case, it's clear that the decision will be taken, will have to be taken by all Spaniards."" He also said he was sorry if people got hurt during the banned referendum last month, but that there was no disproportionate use of force. He had previously saidsome pictures of violence were ""fake"". Would Catalonia be a viable country? Why Basque leaders worry about Spain chaos The controversial colour scheme on Spain's new football shirt By Gavin Lee, BBC News, Barcelona This appears to be an olive branch to supporters of separatism in Catalonia, who are protesting once again across the region. It offers the prospect of a referendum to change the Spanish constitution and therefore make it legally possible to hold a referendum on Catalan independence. But what that means in effect, is that the entire population of Spain - 47 million people - would vote on whether Catalonia should have the right to self-determination. Alfonso Dastis said the legal change might help resolve the Catalan crisis for future generations. But it is a far cry from what deposed Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont had called for, the right for Catalans only to decide. Some major roads and rail services were still blocked as part of demonstrations called by pro-independence groups. Minor scuffles were reported earlier when police moved in to remove protesters. Hundreds of people also gathered in front of Catalonia's presidential palace in Barcelona. The man who wants to break up Spain Demonstrators gathered in front of the Catalan government building in Barcelona Police tried to remove protesters blocking a street in Barcelona A call for a general strike was not backed by the region's major unions, and shops and businesses opened as normal. Universities and some schools were affected. Eight politicians are being held in an investigation by Madrid authorities into alleged rebellion and sedition linked to the declaration of independence. In a speech to parliament, Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy called for a big turnout in the snap election called for 21 December so that Spain could get over the crisis. Pro-independence parties failed on Tuesday to reach an agreement to form a united front for the vote. Sacked Catalan President Carles Puigdemont and four former advisers fled to Belgium, and an investigating judge is yet to decide whether to execute an EU arrest warrant issued by a Spanish judge last week. Mr Puigdemont has been freed on bail and is scheduled to appear in court on 17 November. In other developments: Spain's Environment Minister Isabel GarcÃ­a Tejerina accused Mr Puigdemont of launching an attack on the entire Spanish state with his illegal declaration of independence El Mundo (in Spanish) newspaper released a document,externalwhich allegedly shows that Mr Puigdemont's cabinet had several details ready for an independent Catalonia, including its budget, in June The editor of satirical magazine El Jueves appeared in courtover a satirical story,external(in Spanish) that suggested that riot police deployed to stop the referendum had ""finished"" the region's supply of cocaine Belgium's Prime Minister Charles Michel denied his government was in crisis over Mr Puigdemont's presence, an issue that risks exposing separatist divisions in the country.

"David Prescott joined Jeremy Corbyn's office as an aide over a year ago A key aide to Jeremy Corbyn, and the son of former Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott, has been suspended from his job. David Prescott is being investigated by the Labour leader's office after he was suspended a few days ago, the BBC understands. It comes amid widespread allegations of misconduct at Westminster. No formal complaint has been made to the Labour Party, which declined to give a reason for the suspension. A Labour Party spokesperson said: ""We do not comment on staffing matters."" The BBC has been told his suspension relates to his ""employment"" after an allegation was received by Mr Corbyn's office. The nature of the claim has not been disclosed. A former BBC TV senior producer, Mr Prescott joined the Labour leader's office over a year ago, initially as a speechwriter before becoming a communications manager to the shadow cabinet. He stood as Labour's candidate in Gainsborough in the 2015 election, but lost to Conservative's Sir Edward Leigh. Earlier this year, Mr Prescott failed to become an MP for Hull West and Hessle after former home secretary Alan Johnson announced he was standing down in June's election.

"This video can not be played Paradise Papers: Prince Charlesâ offshore investments revealed Prince Charles campaigned to alter climate-change agreements without disclosing his private estate had an offshore financial interest in what he was promoting, BBC Panorama has found. TheParadise Papersshow the Duchy of Cornwall in 2007 secretly bought shares worth $113,500 in a Bermuda company that would benefit from a rule change. The prince was a friend of a director of Sustainable Forestry Management Ltd. The Duchy of Cornwall says he has no direct involvement in its investments. A Clarence House spokesman said the Prince of Wales had ""certainly never chosen to speak out on a topic simply because of a company that it [the Duchy of Cornwall] may have invested in"". He added: ""In the case of climate change his views are well-known, indeed he has been warning of the threat of global warming to our environment for over 30 years. ""Carbon markets are just one example that the prince has championed since the 1990s and which he continues to promote today."" He added Prince Charles was ""free to offer thoughts and suggestions on a wide range of topics"" and ""cares deeply"" about the issue of climate change but ""it is for others to decide whether to take the advice"". Sir Alistair Graham, former chairman of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, said Prince Charles's actions amounted to a serious conflict of interest. He said: ""There's a conflict of interest between his own investments of the Duchy of Cornwall and what he's trying to achieve publicly. ""And I think it's unfortunate that somebody of his importance, of his influence, becomes involved in such a serious conflict."" Tycoon made $41m from âpeopleâs fundâ Paradise Papers: All you need to know Owner avoided taxes on shopping centre The leaked documents held by law firm Appleby show the Duchy of Cornwall also made offshore investments totalling $3.9m in four funds in the Cayman Islands in 2007. This is legal and there is no suggestion of tax avoidance. A Duchy of Cornwall spokesman said Prince Charles voluntarily pays income tax on any revenue from his estate. He added the estate's investments ""do not derive any tax advantage whatsoever based on their location or any other aspect of their structure and there is no loss of revenue to HMRC as a result"". The prince began campaigning for changes to two important environmental agreements weeks after Sustainable Forestry Management (SFM) sent his office lobbying documents. Prince Charles's estate almost tripled its money in just over a year although it is not clear what caused the rise in the share value. Despite his high profile campaign, the environmental agreements were not changed. The documents reveal theDuchy of Cornwall, an Â£896m private estate that provides Prince Charles with an income,externaland which he is said to be ""actively involved"" in running, bought the shares in February 2007.  At the time $113,500 was worth about Â£58,000. One of SFM's directors was the late Hugh van Cutsem, a millionaire banker and conservationist who has been described as the one of the Prince's closest friends. The minutes of a company board meeting that approved the Duchy's shareholding say: ""The Chairman thanked Mr van Cutsem for his introduction of the Duchy of Cornwall and the Board unanimously agreed that the subscription by the Duchy of Cornwall be kept confidential except in respect of any disclosure required by law."" The island that swapped donkey rides for offshore cash Paradise Papers revelations around the world Apple's secret tax bolthole revealed SFM traded in carbon credits, a market created by international treaties to tackle global warming. It wanted to trade in credits from ""tropical and subtropical forests"" but was hampered by two important climate change agreements, the EU's Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) and the Kyoto Protocol, which largely excluded carbon credits from rainforests. When the Duchy bought its shares, SFM was lobbying for a ""change in policy"" on carbon credits, the documents show. It had hired the US former lead negotiator on the Kyoto Protocol, Stuart Eizenstat ""to lobby for inclusion of forest carbon credits"" in new US and EU laws and regulations. Board minutes from February 2007 show SFM was also taking ""steps to influence events to support forest credits"" ahead of Kyoto Protocol meetings at the end of the year. On 6 June 2007, four months after the Duchy bought its shares, Mr van Cutsem asked SFM's chairman to send lobbying documents to the office of the prince. Under the heading ""public policy and advocacy"", minutes of a board meeting held in Paris say ""the chairman referred the committee to the bundle of materials which had been prepared by the company for various policymakers... Mr van Cutsem... asked that a set of documents be prepared for the Prince of Wales office. The chairman undertook to do so"". Four weeks later, on 2 July,Prince Charles, made a speech that criticised the EU ETS and Kyoto Protocol,externalfor excluding carbon credits from rainforests, and called for change. Speaking at the Business in the Community Awards Dinner, the prince said: ""As the Kyoto protocol now stands tropical rainforest nations have no way of earning credits from their standing forests other than by cutting them down and planting new ones,"" he said. ""The European Carbon Trading Scheme excludes carbon credits for forests from developing nations. This has got be wrong and we must urge the international community to work together to redress these failings urgently."" The campaigning was taking place ahead of meetings about the Kyoto Protocol In October 2007, he launched thePrince's Rainforests Project,external, which aimed to ""increase global recognition of the contribution of tropical deforestation to climate change and to find ways to make the rainforests worth more alive than dead."" In aspeech to mark the launch,external, he said: ""The Kyoto Protocol does not have a mechanism to protect standing rainforests. ""Credits are available for afforestation and reforestation projects, but not for maintaining an old growth forest. And the European Trading Scheme excludes carbon credits for forestry in developing nations altogetherâ¦ surely we have to accept that the pressing urgency of climate change requires a response that embraces rather than excludes primary tropical forests?"" Panorama has been unable to find evidence of any speeches the prince made before 2008 about changing Kyoto and EU ETS to include carbon credits for rainforests. The programme asked the prince's office for any such speeches but they did not respond. Over the next six months, the future king made further speeches and videos about rainforests. In avideo released in January 2008,external, the prince said: ""The immediate priority, I believe, is the need to develop a new credit market which will give a true value to carbon and the ecosystem services the rainforests provide the rest of the world."" Lewis Hamilton 'dodged' VAT on private jet Mrs Brown's Boys stars 'put Â£2m offshore' Bono linked to tax probe in Lithuania In February 2008, he reportedly discussed rainforests at a private meeting with the then Prime Minister Gordon Brown. Days later, he met with the then President of the European Commission, Jose Manuel Barroso, and the EU's environment, energy, trade and agriculture commissioners. In aspeech to 150 MEPs,external, he said: ""I have great hopes that the next version of the European Emissions Trading scheme might extend the helping and very visible hand of a market approach to assist in keeping the rainforests standingâ¦ the lives of billions of people depend on your response and none of us will be forgiven by our children and grandchildren if we falter and fail."" On 18 June 2008, as the global financial crash was beginning, the Duchy sold its stake in SFM. The documents show it was paid $325,000 for the 50 shares. SFM is no longer in existence.

"The huge growth of the offshore finance industry, highlighted by theParadise Papers leak, was the unforeseen result of an ""accounting device"" created by Britain, writes the BBC's Andy Verity. Here's the received wisdom: when the British Empire faded in size and significance after World War Two, a few scattered islands around the globe wanted to keep their imperial ties to London. The British government had to find a way to reduce the economic dependence of the likes of Bermuda, Montserrat or the British Virgin Islands, so it awarded them special tax-exempt status, creating the conditions for a thriving financial services industry. Yes, tax evasion and money laundering may have got a little out of hand from time to time, but overall it succeeded in lifting them out of dependence on the UK government. Tycoon made $41m from âpeopleâs fundâ Charles lobbied on climate policy after shares buy Paradise Papers: All you need to know But there's a deeper story. It wasn't by design that the remnants of a dying British Empire morphed into a world leader in offshore financial services, selling secrecy and tax avoidance to multi-nationals and the wealthiest individuals in the world. Instead, the crucial moment was more of an accident - which gave rise to advantages no-one had foreseen. And it began not in Bermuda or Jersey but in another offshore centre - ""offshore"" not to the UK, but to the US - the City of London. When the 20th Century began, income tax was in single digits and progressive taxation - charging richer people a higher rate - had barely begun. In the run-up to World War One, chancellors of the exchequer - from Asquith to Lloyd George - began raising taxes to pay for social reforms, such as the old age pension. As the war progressed, the state demanded more and more income tax from every citizen and higher rates for the wealthy, leading to a top rate of 30% by 1919. Accountants to wealthy individuals began to devise ways to avoid tax. Clients could become resident in Jersey, where tax rates were far lighter. Or, if they wanted to stay in London, they might put their money in a trust registered elsewhere, perhaps on the Isle of Man, where in theory it was no longer theirs - and therefore not visible to the prying eyes of an Inland Revenue inspector. David Lloyd George served as Chancellor in Herbert Henry Asquith's government, before rising to PM in 1916 But it was in the dying days of the Empire that the offshore financial services industry truly boomed. Defined by purpose rather than geography, ""offshore"" means any jurisdiction that seeks to attract investors on the basis of light taxes and looser regulations. On that basis, the epicentre of the offshore industry is not Nassau in the Bahamas or George Town in the Cayman Islands. As author Nick Shaxson points out in his fascinating offshore expose, Treasure Islands: ""The modern offshore system did not start its explosive growth on scandal-tainted and palm-fringed islands in the Caribbean, or in the Alpine foothills of Zurich. It all began in London, as Britain's formal Empire gave way to something more subtle."" In 1957, Britain and its imperial remains were trying to recover from a financial crisis.  The previous year the UK had joined forces with France and Israel to try to recapture the Suez Canal after it was nationalised by the defiant anti-colonial Egyptian President, Gamal Abdel Nasser. Viewing the invasion as European imperialism at its worst, the US refused any assistance. By the end of 1956, a run on the pound was under way. The Bank of England wanted to curb the outflow of pounds by boosting interest rates sharply, but Her Majesty's Treasury had other ideas. Since the Bretton Woods economic conference of 1944 towards the end of World War Two, countries had agreed to control movements of capital to curb the speculative flows into and out of countries that had worsened the economic crises of the past. If, say, Tate & Lyle wanted to invest several million pounds in a new sugar production facility in Jamaica, it would need signed approval from Her Majesty's Treasury. Normally this was a formality. But during the Suez crisis, the Treasury announced that, on a temporary basis, it would no longer approve foreign capital investments. The Bank of England did not get its way against the Treasury The City's merchant banks were alarmed. Arranging finance for projects in the former colonies was their lifeblood. How would they avoid ruin? Digging through the archives, financial academic Gary Burn unearthed what happened next. Hearing the banks' complaints in a series of meetings, the Bank of England agreed in late 1957 to allow the commercial banks to continue to lend and borrow to foreign clients on two conditions: the lending had to be in a currency other than sterling, and both sides of the transaction - the lender and the borrower - had to reside somewhere other than the UK ""The decision was momentous in all respects,"" says one of the leading experts in offshore finance, Prof Ronen Palan of City, University of London. ""They simply deemed certain transactions as not taking place in the UK. Where did the transactions take place for regulatory purposes? Nowhere. ""I think it wasn't at all by design; it was a mistake. They didn't understand the implications. It was seen as an accounting device."" The so-called ""Eurodollar"" was born - a global offshore financial market, transacting in dollars and allowing unlimited sums to be borrowed and lent, but under the control of no single state.  No act of Parliament (or Congress) sanctioned the decision. There was no thoughtful policy-making, no careful debate. The Treasury was at first left in the dark. But within years the implications were obvious - this could revive the City of London's fortunes. ""By the time the Treasury figured it out, they thought, 'this is good business for the City',"" said Prof Palan. Banks from all around the world could borrow and lend in dollars without being subject to US tax or banking regulations - making banking in dollars more profitable out of London than out of Wall Street. Offshore banks didn't have to hold money in reserve for every dollar they lent (as they would in the US), which would dramatically cut their costs. While transactions were arranged in London, the lenders and borrowers could be registered anywhere. But the parties to Eurodollar transactions needed addresses. So, zero-tax jurisdictions from the Cayman Islands to the Montserrat were used by London's investment banks as the official tax residences of their wealthy customers. Clients could avoid both tax and undesirable scrutiny - for example from the US tax authorities. In the British Overseas Territories, local laws were passed to attract more registration business, collecting modest fees that mounted up. No need for a bank branch out there - just a drawer in an offshore lawyer's filing cabinet. The City of London began its recovery to become the centre of finance it is today Howls of protest from the US government were ignored. Between 1960 and 1970, the size of the Eurodollar market went from $1bn to $46bn. In the 1970s, countries rich in petrodollars from soaring oil prices were faced with a dilemma: repatriate the money to New York - where they would be taxed on it - or keep it offshore. By 1980, the so-called Eurodollar market was worth more than half a trillion. After the deregulation of the City of London in the 1986 ""Big Bang"", US banks joined in, setting up in London. And as the 1990s and 2000s progressed, it became the undisputed global centre for foreign currency trading. Banks' wealthy individual and corporate clients didn't incorporate in the Cayman Islands or the British Virgin Islands because they liked the weather there - many never visited. Offshore centres were attractive to businesses looking to reduce their tax bill, but sometimes, more importantly, to avoid what they regarded as excessive regulation. Cayman Islands-registered companies were used heavily, for example, by the energy giant Enron as it built its business model based on fraudulent accounts. Tax-free, light regulation jurisdictions, including the Bahamas, the Cayman Islands and Delaware in the US, became the corporate locations of choice for legitimate hedge funds. They were also used to incorporate the vehicles at the heart of the global financial crisis - the 'structured investment vehicles' that did not show up on bank's balance sheets and bought billions of mortgage-backed securities, massively increasing the unnoticed risks in the global financial system which led to the crisis of 2008. Likewise, the British Virgin Islands has been used by many legitimate businesses.

"Appleby decided against a shelf company to be owned by Isabel dos Santos, the daughter of Angola's ex-president Appleby is the main source of the leaked Paradise Papers documents and, like all providers of offshore financial services, has to check certain things with its prospective clients in order to prevent money laundering, corruption and other illegal activity. This process is called ""due diligence"". Different countries have different requirements, but most expect the service provider to know who its client is, where the client's money has come from and the purpose of the company it is setting up. Among the applications, there are often some questionable individuals and companies trying to set up shell companies. Then there are the PEPs, or politically exposed persons. They may or may not have genuine applications but the risk they would bring has to be fully vetted. The lawyers at the heart of the leaks The examples below reflect decisions made at the time; it is unclear whether further requests were made. Some are shown in their original document format: 15 Feb 2012:Proposed shareholders/directors of funds, both principals produced passport copies issued by the ""World Government of World citizens"". This was deemed to be outside of ACSL's (Appleby Corporate Services Limited) risk parameters and these potential clients were therefore declined. 23 Apr 2012:Potential client wishes to acquire a ""shelf"" company in Mauritius or BVI (British Virgin Islands). The shelf company would be owned by Isabel JosÃ© dos Santos, who is the daughter of the then Angolan President, JosÃ© Eduardo dos Santos.  The company was to be used for investment purposes. ACSL does not provide shelf companies to clients. Furthermore World-Check searches indicate both Isabel and JosÃ© are PEPS. Other internet searches revealed adverse findings for both Isabel JosÃ© dos Santos and JosÃ© Eduardo dos Santos. 29 May 2013:Potential client wishes to set up BVI company. Details of the proposed transaction regarding citizenship and residence and activities of company is risky. Client may want to use precision guided bombs to communicate. 20 Jun 2013:Proposed engagement presented as very high risk. The High Risk Committee declined to take on the business due in part to the clients' ties to the Rwandan military thus would be PEPs and Rwanda may be on various sanctions lists, and bribery and corruption are of concern. The company proposed business will be conducted in a non-recognized jurisdiction. 20 Jan 2014:Proposed engagement presented as high risk as the proposed business dealings are concentrated in the Middle East and Iran. Iran remains the subject of several sanctions and we could not mitigate against bribery and corruption risks and the payments to escrow could be illicit. 10 Mar 2014:Potential engagement requested our service to incorporate a company which will be a holding company providing instant exchange between Bitcoin* and Kenyan Shillings for their investors. (virtual currency related business). *NOTE: The reasons for this decline are not known, but other documents show internal discussions within Appleby about the risk of Bitcoin being used to fund terrorism or the drug trade.

"A high-profile figure in Prime Minister Boris Johnson's cabinet, Priti Patel was appointed home secretary in July last year. A Eurosceptic, she was a leading figure in the Vote Leave campaign during the EU referendum. Shortly after taking up the post of home secretary,she said she wanted criminals to ""literally feel terror""at the thought of breaking the law. A Cabinet Office inquiry into her conductfound that Ms Patel had ""unintentionally"" breached the ministerial codein her behaviour towards civil servants. Her ""approach on occasions has amounted to behaviour that can be described as bullying,"" the government's independent advisor on standards said. Mr Johnson decided Ms Patel had not broken the ministerial code and could remain in her post as home secretary. Ms Patel said ""I am direct and have at times got frustrated"", but added: ""It has never been my intention to cause upset to anyone."" The inquiry was launched in March 2020 after the resignation of the top civil servant at the Home Office, Sir Philip Rutnam. Sir Philip - who is suing for constructive dismissal - alleged staff felt that Ms Patel had ""created fear"". As home secretary she has had to deal with several crises, including the London Bridge and Streatham stabbing attacks - later deemed by police to be terrorist incidents - and the deaths of 39 migrants in the back of a lorry in Essex. She has also played a key role in drawing up a newpoints-based immigration systemfor after the UK's Brexit transition period, saying she wants firms to invest more in British workers ""rather than simply relying on labour from abroad"". During the summer and autumn of 2020, she also took a leading role in negotiations with France over preventing a rising number of migrants crossing the English Channel. Priti Patel has asked French authorities to intercept and return migrant boats trying to cross the Channel. Ms Patel, who is 48, also served in Theresa May's cabinet as secretary of state for international development. Her appointment was greeted with concern by some in the aid community, who recalled that she had previously suggested that the department should be abolished and subsumed into a new trade department. In post,she said she wanted the UK's aid budget to provide greater value for money. The aid department has since been merged with the Foreign Office. She resigned from the role in 2017 after it emerged she had held undisclosed meetings with Israeli officials while on holiday. Sheacknowledged that her actions ""fell below the high standards""expected. Born:29 March, 1972, in London Education:Watford Grammar School; economics degree from Keele University, postgraduate study in British government and politics at University of Essex Family:Born to Gujarati parents who fled Uganda in the 1960s. Career:Elected Witham MP in 2010. Became Treasury minister in 2014 and minister for employment in 2015. Appointed secretary of state for international development in July 2016. Appointed home secretary in July 2019, a post she still holds. Born in London to Gujarati parents who left Uganda in the 1960s, she was educated at Watford Grammar School for Girls. She went on to study at Keele and Essex universities before getting a job at Conservative Central Office, which she left to head up the press office for the Referendum Party, founded by Eurosceptic billionaire Sir James Goldsmith, from 1995 to 1997. After William Hague became Conservative leader, she returned to the party to be his deputy press secretary, from 1997 to 2000. She went on to spend a number of years working with the Weber Shandwick public affairs consultancy - reportedly advising Ikea, the Meat & Livestock Commission and British American Tobacco, among others. She also had a spell as international public policy adviser for drinks giant Diageo. Ms Patel sought to get elected to Parliament in 2005 but lost out in Nottingham North. A year later, she was one of those selected for new leader David Cameron's A-list of candidates and went on to become MP for Witham, Essex, in 2010. Ms Patel achieved ministerial rank four years later as exchequer secretary to the Treasury, before promotion to employment minister following David Cameron's 2015 general election victory. She is positioned on the right of the party - she voted against gay marriage, campaigned against the smoking ban, and previously advocated bringing back the death penalty, before later saying she did not support it. Ms Patel, whose father stood as a UKIP councillor in 2013, names Margaret Thatcher as her political hero.

"It was precisely a week ago that I was summoned to the Ministry of Defence to ask Sir Michael Fallon why he was resigning. Seven days on, for an unconnected reason, Theresa May has just lost another one of her ministers. That time the resignation was rather differently handled - some private speculation through the day, then a discreet summoning to a quiet room in the department until one of the minister's team came to say: ""Be ready, the secretary of state is resigning, we are finalising the letters between us and Number 10 right now."" This time, the process has been more like a pantomime, with speculation rife for nearly 24 hours that she was on her way out, no-one in government moving to quash it, leaving journalists, on the first day of parliament's recess, free to track Priti Patel's plane online then her journey back to Westminster. Goodness knows what Ms Patel's Ugandan hosts, who were expecting her to visit today, make of it all. Beyond today's palaver, though, her exit throws up problems for Mrs May. It is never as simple as one out, one in. Mrs May, who hoped to earn her authority back through competence, and orderly government, needs to restore a sense of calm after a chaotic week. To convey even a limp grip on power, misbehaving ministers need to be brought in line, and a restive Tory party needs to be able to believe Number 10 has some capability left. But with Ms Patel's departure, the prime minister must try most importantly to preserve the delicate balance around the cabinet table. Ministers' make up is finely tuned between those who desire a loose arrangement with the European Union after Brexit and those who want to stay tightly bound. With the balance more or less equal between those factions, it's as if the prime minister has the casting vote. For as long as that formula is preserved, both sides will preserve her. Upset that equilibrium with the wrong choices in a reshuffle, even of one, and the way through the most challenging decisions the government faces becomes more complicated, and the prime minister's own position more precarious still.

"This video can not be played Hassan has been given a new genetically modified skin that covers 80% of his body A child has been given a new genetically modified skin that covers 80% of his body, in a series of lifesaving operations. Hassan, who lives in Germany, has a genetic disease - junctional epidermolysis bullosa - that leaves his skin as fragile as a butterfly's wings. A piece of his skin was taken, its DNA was repaired in the laboratory and the modified skin grafted back on. After nearly two years, the new skin appears completely normal. The family's full details have not been released to protect their privacy, but Hassan's father said the transformation was ""like a dream"". ""Hassan feels like a normal person now, he plays, he's being active, he's enjoying his life and he's not the way he was before,"" he said. Hassan was born in Syria and has had blisters and wounds all over his body since he was a few days old. Normally, the different layers of the skin are held together by ""anchoring proteins"". But the junctional epidermolysis bullosa means Hassan's DNA lacks the instructions for sticking his epidermis (the surface layer) to the dermis (the next one down). There is no cure, and about four in 10 patients do not even reach adolescence. Hassan attended the Children's Hospital at Ruhr-University, in Bochum, Germany, in June 2015. The seven-year-old was missing a massive amount of epidermis. Most of his body looked like a red-raw open wound. Doctors were preparing the family for the worst. Dr Tobias Hirsch, from the hospital, said: ""We initially decided to provide palliative care because we had no chance to save the life of this child."" But a team of biologists specialising in gene therapy were brought in from the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, in Italy - and the parents gave approval for them to try an experimental therapy. In September 2015, a 4 sq cm (0.6 sq inches) patch of skin was taken from an area where the epidermis was still intact. The biopsy was then infected with a customised virus. Viruses are good at getting inside cells, and this one was used like a postman to deliver the missing instructions for binding the layers of skin together. The now genetically modified skin cells were grown to make skin grafts totalling 0.85 sq m (9 sq ft). It took three operations over that winter to cover 80% of the child's body in the new skin. Hassan's father said his son had spent months covered in so many bandages he had looked like a mummy. But 21 months later, the skin is functioning normally with no sign of blistering. You can even pinch the once incredibly fragile skin, with no sign of damage. Dr Hirsch said: ""The kid is now back to school, he plays soccer, so there was a tremendous increase in quality of life."" Dr Anna Martinez, who leads the national epidermolysis bullosa service at Great Ormond Street Hospital, told the BBC: ""I got goosebumps when I heard this, it was just incredible. ""Today this treatment is not available and it is not going to be available in the next few months, but this is a massive advance in research and is going to give us hope going forward with gene therapy."" Epidermolysis bullosais is rare,but the charity DEBRA, which campaigns for EB patients,external, estimates half a million people are affected around the world. There are different forms of epidermolysis bullosa, including simplex, dystrophic and, as in this case, junctional. Each is caused by different genetic faults leading to different building blocks of skin being missing. Prof Michele De Luca, from the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, told the BBC: ""The gene is different, the protein is different and the outcome may be different [for each form of EB] so we need formal clinical trials."" But if they can make it work, it could be a therapy that lasts a lifetime. An analysis of the structure of Hassan's skin,detailed in the journal Nature,external, has discovered a group of long-lived stem cells are that constantly renewing his genetically modified skin.

"This video can not be played 'To Kevin Spacey: Shame on you for what you did to my son' New allegations of sexual harassment and predatory behaviour towards men and women by Kevin Spacey have emerged. The claims, spanning from the mid-1980s to 2016, raise further questions about the US actor's conduct in the decades he worked in Hollywood and as artistic director at London's Old Vic theatre. The BBC has contacted Mr Spacey for comment. On Wednesday, the journalist whose October tweet triggered a series of accusations about Mr Spacey spoke out. Allow Twitter content?

Former television news anchor Heather Unruh told a press conference in Boston that her son had been sexually assaulted by Mr Spacey, at the age of 18 in a bar in Nantucket, Massachusetts, in July 2016. She said Mr Spacey had bought her son alcohol - the drinking age in Massachusetts is 21. After getting him drunk, Mr Spacey had ""stuck his hand inside my son's pants and grabbed his genitals"", she said. She said Mr Spacey had invited her son to a party, but he had run away from the bar when Mr Spacey had gone to the lavatory. A criminal investigation was now under way, Mrs Unruh said. ""Shame on you for what you did to my son. Your actions are criminal,"" Mrs Unruh said through her tears. Since the first allegation of sexual advances were made by actor Anthony Rapp on 30 October, US network Netflix axed further production of Mr Spacey's House of Cards drama, the International Academy of Television Arts and Sciences announced it will no longer give the actor a special Emmy award, and his agent and publicist dropped him as a client. In response to Mr Rapp's claims, Mr Spacey said he has no memory of the incident and offered an apology. On 3 November police in the UK confirmed they were investigating an alleged assault on a man from 2008. Mr Spacey said he was seeking treatmentafter facing the allegations but did not give information about the type. This video can not be played Former London barman Kris Nixon says he was groped by Kevin Spacey Since then more men have come forward. Barman Kris Nixon, from Belfast, Northern Ireland, said he had been working near the Old Vic in 2007 when Mr Spacey groped him at a party. ""Kevin Spacey sat down next to me on a sofa, then reached over and grabbed my penis,"" he said. The actor had then suggested he perform a sexual act on Mr Nixon, according to the barman, who then left the party. Kevin Spacey: How the story unfolded Two weeks later, Mr Nixon was in the basement of the bar he had been working in, when, he said, he realised Spacey was two feet (60cm) behind him. The actor grabbed Mr Nixon's waistband and offered to ""make it up"" to him, he said. ""I didn't want to make a scene about it - he was a customer. I didn't want to get fired. ""Until Anthony Rapp spoke out, I never felt able to tell anyone."" Spacey was dropped from his House of Cards series after new allegations Meanwhile, an American film-maker has told the BBC that he was groped and sexually harassed by Mr Spacey as a 22-year-old junior crew member. The man, now 44, who does not want to be identified, said the ""powerful"" director had made advances towards him on the shoot of Albino Alligator in 1995. ""He was very affable and nice to everybody. We shook hands and he took an interest in me. He offered to watch one of my student films, which I was very flattered by,"" he said. But, he said, Mr Spacey had quickly become ""creepy"" and one day insisted he sit in his director's chair. ""He started massaging my neck and my shoulders, and I felt incredibly uncomfortable."" The film-maker, from California, said he had been singled out as a target because of his youth and inexperience. ""On one of the last days of shootingâ¦ he sat down next to me and put his thigh against mine and put his hand on my thigh and moved it towards my inner thigh,"" he said. He told the BBC he had decided to come forward after hearing the allegations by actor Anthony Rapp but felt nervous about revealing his identity because of the influential position Mr  Spacey continued to hold in the industry. At the time, Mr Spacey's powerful position had made him feel conflicted about his encounters with the director, he said. ""I was getting the attention of the most powerful person on the movie set, and I wanted to work in Hollywood,"" he said. ""But it was an interest that made me feel totally uneasy, uncomfortable, confused. I didn't know what to do, I felt trapped. I felt harassed, sexually harassed."" The film-maker said he hoped coming forward would encourage others. ""I hope it makes those people who come forward feel less alone if they are feeling alone and confused, like I was when I was 22."" One woman told the BBC that she suffered depression after an encounter with Mr Spacey. Kate Edwards, now a performing arts teacher in London, claims Mr Spacey made advances towards her when she had been a production assistant on Broadway show Long Day's Journey Into Night in 1986. Ms Edwards, who was 17 at the time, said she had been alone in a lift with the 27-year-old Mr Spacey when he had invited her to a ""James Dean birthday party"" in his flat. Kate Edwards (second left, back row) with the cast and crew of Long Day's Journey Into Night, starring Kevin Spacey, in 1986 When she had arrived, she said, there had been no-one else there. Ms Edwards said she had consensually kissed Mr Spacey, but then had started to feel uncomfortable and asked when others would arrive.. ""I said I want to go home and change. I felt pressured, and it became quite clear that his intention was to have sex with me. ""He became cold and said, 'Find your own way.' She was left ""confused, completely isolated, ashamed."" She said the actor had ""cut her dead"" after the encounter, she had become depressed, had gained weight, and had eventually been unable to continue working on the show. Ms Edwards said her message to Mr Spacey today would be: ""I would like you to know that what you did hurt me, it affected me for years afterwards. ""What you did to me and what you did to other young people was unacceptable.""

"This video can not be played The Louvre Abu Dhabi opened in November 2017 French President Emmanuel Macron unveiled a Â£1bn newly-built museum in Abu Dhabi on Wednesday. The new Louvre, built over the past 10 years, holds 600 artworks permanently and 300 loaned from France. Praised by critics, the building boasts a latticed dome designed to allow the desert sun to filter through. It holds art and items related to history and religion from around the world and Mr Macron called it a ""bridge between civilisations"". He said: ""Those who seek to say Islam is the destruction of other religions are liars."" The project, agreed between France and Abu Dhabi in 2007, was initially intended to open in 2012 but was delayed by the global financial crisis and plummeting oil prices, sending the final cost soaring over its original $654m (then Â£340m) budget. The Louvre Abu Dhabi is the first project to open in a series which the United Arab Emirates hope will put the city on the cultural map In addition, the museum is paying France hundreds of millions of dollars for the use of the Louvre name and for loans of artworks and managerial advice. The museum has attracted its share of controversy overconcerns about the welfare of the workers constructing the building. But critics have declared the finished building -  the first to open in a series of projects conceived by UAE authorities at creating a cultural oasis on the Abu Dhabi island of Saadiyat -a ""mesmerising"" success, if with a ""touch of bling"",external. The Paris Louvre is a landmark in the French capital and the world's largest art museum, with millions of visitors a year. The Abu Dhabi building, designed by French architect Jean Nouvel, brings to mind an Arab medina (an ancient quarter of a city). None of its 55 rooms, including 23 permanent galleries,  is alike. The latticed dome protects visitors from the scalding heat, while allowing the rooms to glow with natural light. On show are works from around the world - from established European masters including Van Gogh, Gaugin and Picasso, to Americans such as James Abbott McNeill Whistler (his painting Whistler's Mother, above) and the modern Chinese artist Ai Weiwei. The museum has also joined force with Arab institutions who have loaned 28 prized works. Among the priceless artefacts on show are a statue of a sphinx dating back to the 6th Century BC and a frieze depicting figures from the Koran. The museum's doors open to the public on Saturday - with all entrance tickets, priced 60 dirhams ($16.80), sold out. Emirati officials will hope the magnificence of the building will put concerns about the wellbeing of its workers and controversy about delays and overrunning costs in the shade.

"Former entertainer Rolf Harris has renewed his application to have his convictions for indecent assault quashed at the Court of Appeal. His lawyers said there was overwhelming evidence to show he wasn't in an area where one of the alleged indecent assaults took place. The 87-year-old is hoping to overturn the 12 indecent assault convictions he was jailed for in 2014. His two-day appeal hearing was heard by three judges at the High Court. The Australian-born TV presenter was sentenced to nearly six years in prison in 2014. He was released in May. He was convicted of 12 indecent assaults against four girls, including one aged eight, which took place between 1968 and 1986. His defence team have put forward new evidence which they claim shows he wasn't at Leigh Park community centre in Hampshire where one girl said she was assaulted in the 1960s. The court heard from two former police officers and the father of one of the victims - who all said Harris was not in that part of Hampshire at the time of the alleged assault. Stephen Vullo QC, representing Harris, said: ""We only need to show one count was unsafe in order to have a retrial."" The prosecution argued that despite these new claims, the force of evidence against him is still there. The three judges will now reach their conclusion which is expected to take two weeks.

"This video can not be played Carl Sargeant ""wasn't dealt with fairly"", says Labour AM Jenny Rathbone The family of sacked Welsh Labour minister Carl Sargeant has said he was deprived of ""natural justice"". He was found dead on Tuesday after being sacked from the cabinet and suspended from Labour. He faced allegations of ""unwanted attention, inappropriate touching or groping"". Leighton Andrews, a former key ally of Carwyn Jones, said he is ""angry"" the first minister did TV interviews commenting on allegations. The former AM and cabinet minister said Mr Jones had not followed ""due process"" by speaking to the media on Monday. On Thursday Labour AMs will meet for the first time since Mr Sargeant died. First Minister Carwyn Jones's spokesman said: ""Like everyone in the Welsh Labour family Carwyn is deeply upset by the death of his friend. ""Tomorrow Welsh Labour AMs will meet in the assembly to remember Carl and discuss the tragic events of the past week. Carwyn will make a further statement following the meeting."" Sacked Labour minister found dead Profile of long-serving AM's career Ex-minister 'facing number of claims' Minister removed over conduct claims On Monday Mr Jones told the BBC and ITV there were ""a number"" of allegations made by women against Mr Sargeant. But Mr Andrews told BBC One's Wales Live programmethat he felt the first minister should not have made any public comments after the matter was referred to the Labour Party on Friday. ""Having passed this over on Friday to the Labour party, on Monday the first minister is doing interviews with the BBC and I think with ITV as well in which he is elaborating on the story and commenting on the story,"" he said. ""Well, that is not due process. ""I'm very angry at those interviews on Monday and the anger within the Labour Party across Wales and beyond the Labour Party in Carl's local community, people in other political parties, people in no political party. ""People do not think Carl Sargeant has been treated fairly."" This video can not be played Leighton Andrews said the allegations should have been dealt with ""behind closed doors"" His comments came after Mr Sargeant's family released correspondence between his solicitor and Labour to highlight their concern over his treatment. It shows Mr Sargeant pushed for more specific details on the claims, and that his mental well-being was being affected. Relatives said he was distressed at being unable to defend himself. The Labour Party said that, in line with agreed procedure, the nature of the allegations was outlined to Mr Sargeant. The Alyn and Deeside AM had vowed to clear his name after being sacked as communities secretary by Mr Jones on Friday, but said he did not know the details of the allegations. It is understood he took his own life. A family spokesman said on Wednesday they were publishing the correspondence ""in light of the continued unwillingness"" of the Labour Party ""to clarify the nature of the allegations made against Carl"". ""Up to the point of his tragic death on Tuesday morning Carl was not informed of any of the detail of the allegations against him, despite requests and warnings regarding his mental welfare,"" the spokesman said. ""The correspondence also discloses the solicitor's concern that media appearances by the first minister on Monday were prejudicing the inquiry. ""The family wish to disclose the fact that Carl maintained his innocence and he categorically denied any wrongdoing. ""The distress of not being able to defend himself properly against these unspecified allegations meant he was not afforded common courtesy, decency or natural justice."" In a statement through solicitors later, the family added that they hope ""there will be a full investigation and scrutiny of the way that the relevant parties concerned dealt with the allegations, Mr Sargeant personally and the statements that have been made in the press and media"". ""Those that owed a clear duty of care to Carl and to his family will, no doubt in due course, need to provide clarity on their respective positions in this tragedy,"" they added. ""No support was offered to Mr Sargeant other than that personally offered by close friends and family,"" the family added. Carl Sargeant's family have released two emails and a letter sent between his solicitor and Welsh Labour. It includes: An email from his solicitor that alleges First Minister Carwyn Jones prejudiced ""what is allegedly an independent enquiry"" by Labour A letter that said he was accused of ""unwanted attention, inappropriate touching or groping"" - allegations Mr Sargeant had denied Read the correspondencehere This video can not be played MP Mark Tami says if procedures were followed in the run-up to Carl Sargeant's death something had gone ""badly wrong"" Mr Sargeant's Westminster constituency colleague, Labour MP Mark Tami, said Mr Sargeant's family were ""angry"" because ""they obviously have questions about the process and how it has ended up with this"". ""I think they need some space to try as best they can to come to terms with what has happened to Carl,"" he said. ""If the procedure's been followed then we need to look at the procedure because something's gone badly wrong."" The first minister is facing questions from within his own party about how the situation was handled, after finding out about the allegations early last week. Staff from his office, but not civil servants, spoke to the women involved and referred their complaints to Welsh Labour, which was investigating, and suspended Mr Sargeant. Allow Twitter content?

Jenny Rathbone, Labour AM for Cardiff Central, said she felt Mr Sargeant ""wasn't dealt with fairly"". ""If allegations are made against you, you must know what they are so that you can respond to them,"" she said on BBC Radio Wales' Good Morning Wales programme. UKIP Wales leader Neil Hamilton called on Mr Jones to resign, saying he ""failed to fulfil his duty of care"" to Mr Sargeant. Brecon and Radnorshire Conservative MP Chris Davies also called on the first minister to resign, saying the way he had handled the matter was ""terrible"". What did Carwyn Jones know about allegations of misconduct against Carl Sargeant - and when? In a television interview two days ago, the day before the death of the ex-cabinet secretary, Carwyn Jones insisted that the first time he heard of the allegations was last week. But multiple sources from more than one party have told me that Carwyn Jones had discussed allegations of misconduct with Carl Sargeant once before, and had received an explanation of the incident. Are the sources right? The simple answer is I do not know. But Carwyn Jones knows the truth and he should answer the question as soon as possible.

"This video can not be played Air Force One arrives in the Chinese capital Beijing US President Donald Trump is in China for talks likely to be dominated by tensions over North Korea. His arrival came after a speech to the South Korean parliament in which Mr Trump urged China to further isolate North Korea. The White House sees China as pivotal in reining in the North's nuclear aims but Beijing says it is doing enough. Chinese President Xi Jinping gave a lavish welcome to Mr Trump in what has been called a ""state visit-plus"". How Trump's Asia trip will unfold Trump vs Xi: The two men compared Before his visit, Mr Trump piled praise on Mr Xi, saying he was looking forward to meeting the Chinese president after ""his great political victory"".

By John Sudworth, BBC News, Beijing So the world's first and second most powerful men have met in Beijing. But which one's which? Side by side, as presidents Trump and Xi stood for photographs at Beijing's Forbidden City, some might wonder. Mr Trump is seen as weakened at home, beset by scandal and a faltering agenda, and disengaged abroad. Mr Xi is being hailed as the most powerful leader since Chairman Mao, with a vision for Chinese leadership on the global stage. And while the US president comes here expecting much - help with North Korea, action to reduce the trade deficit - China seems to be seeking little, except in one broad sense. State media is talking about a ""new chapter of history"" based on a ""major-power relationship"". It's not about first or second place any more, it's about parity of esteem. With a ""transactional"" US president, less prone to talk about US values, China senses that time may have come. Hours earlier, in the South Korean capital Seoul, Mr Trump described North Korea as ""a hell that no person deserves"". North Korea's nuclear weapons programme has sparked international alarm, with Pyongyang carrying out its biggest nuclear test yet in September. In typically stark language, Mr Trump warned the North: ""Do not underestimate us. Do not try us."" But there were hints though he might be open to a deal, telling the North ""we will offer you a path for a better future"". Singling out Russia and China, he urged ""all responsible nations"" to isolate the North, and fully implement UN sanctions, downgrade diplomatic ties and sever trade and technology ties. This video can not be played Trump to N Korea: 'Your weapons are not making you safer' ""You cannot support, you cannot supply, you cannot accept,"" he said. China is North Korea's largest trading partner and only major ally, but says it is committed to the UN sanctions and argues its leverage has been overestimated. Despite having congratulated Mr Xi on his political ascendency, Mr Trump has been a vocal critic over what he sees as unfair Chinese trade practices. During his presidential campaign, he called Beijing a currency manipulator and accused it of stealing US jobs. He is expected to seek ways to reduce what he has called the ""embarrassing"" US trade deficit with China. China has been keen to give Mr Trump a generous welcome US and Chinese firms have already signed $9bn (Â£6.9bn) in deals as part of the visit. There have been questions over whether Mr Trump would use his favoured communications platform Twitter while in China, where it is banned. But a White House official has said ""the president will tweet whatever he wants"". Mr Trump is in China as part of a five-nation tour of Asia. He has also visited Japan so far and will go on to Vietnam and the Philippines.

"Revenge porn has affected up to one in five Australian women, according to one study Facebook is testing a system that allows users to message themselves their nude photos in an effort to combat so-called revenge porn. It will store a ""fingerprint"" of images to prevent any copies of them being shared by disgruntled ex-lovers. The trial is in Australia, where studies suggest one in five women aged 18-45 may have had image-based abuse. But one expert says there will still be problems outside Facebook and related sites such as WhatsApp and Instagram. Facebook said it looked forward ""to getting feedback and learning"" from the trial. Revenge porn is a growing issue in Australia, according to e-safety commissioner Julie Inman Grant, who is working with Facebook on the trial.

""It would be like sending yourself your image in email, but obviously this is a much safer, secure end-to-end way of sending the image without sending it through the ether,"" she said. ""They're not storing the image, they're storing the link and using artificial intelligence and other photo-matching technologies."" Users wanting to take part in the trial must first file a report with the commissioner, who will in turn share it with Facebook.

"NHS England's boss said trust in politics would be damaged if the NHS did not get more The health service should get the cash boost it was promised during the EU referendum, NHS England's boss says. Simon Stevens used controversial claims used by Vote Leave - that the NHS could benefit by Â£350m a week - to put the case for more money in a major speech. With waiting times worsening, he said trust in politics would be damaged if the NHS did not get more. He said the budget had grown modestly in recent years, but those rises would ""nose-dive"" in the next few years. Does the Â£350m claim stack up? 10 charts that show why the NHS is in trouble He said if action was not taken the NHS would really start to struggle, predicting hospital waiting lists could grow by a quarter to five million by 2021. The speech by Mr Stevens at the NHS Providers' annual conference of health managers is highly political, coming just a fortnight before the Budget.  Can't find your health trust?Browse the full list Rather search by typing?Back to search If you can't see the NHS Tracker,click or tap here,external. During the referendum it was claimed Â£350m a week was sent to the EU and that would be better spent on the NHS. The claim was widely contested at the time and ever since - it did not take into account the rebate the UK had nor the fact the UK benefited from investment from the EU. Some argued it proved highly influential in the referendum result. Mr Stevens refused to be drawn on just how much money he was after - sources close to him said he was not specifically asking for an extra Â£350m a week, which would work out at an extra Â£18bn a year. Instead, they said it just needed to be significantly more than had been promised to date if waiting times were not to worsen. It comes as three highly influential health think-tanks - the King's Fund, the Nuffield Trust and the Health Foundation - published a joint report calling for an extra Â£4bn to be given to health next year. That amounts to eight times more than health spending is due to rise by. He told delegates in Birmingham: ""The NHS wasn't on the ballot paper, but it was on the ballot bus, 'Vote Leave for a better funded health service, Â£350m a week.' ""Rather than our criticising these clear Brexit funding commitments to NHS patients - promises entered into by cabinet ministers and by MPs - the public want to see them honoured. ""Trust in democratic politics will not be strengthened if anyone now tries to argue, 'You voted Brexit, partly for a better funded health service. But precisely because of Brexit, you now can't have one.'"" He said the ""modest"" rises seen in recent years were set to ""nose-drive"" in the next two, with the budget growing by 0.4% next year and by less than 1% the year after once inflation was taken into account. Mr Stevens said if that continued ""choking"" of investment happened the NHS would have to ""turn back a decade of progress"". He warned a hospital waiting list of five million by 2021 was likely - meaning a 10th of the population would be waiting for treatment. Currently, just under four million people are. NHS Providers chief executive Chris Hopson has also given his backing to extra money. He pointed out key targets for A&E, routine operations and cancer care were already being widely missed. ""The Budget is an important opportunity, at the beginning of this Parliament, to protect care quality for patients and service users and help the NHS break out of the downward spiral in which it is currently trapped. ""There isn't enough funding to cope."" The government has promised the NHS front-line budget will be Â£8bn a year higher by 2022 - once inflation is taken into account - than it is now. But that does not take into account the whole health budget - which also includes spending on things such as training and healthy lifestyle services, like stop smoking services. Once that is factored in, the current average annual increase are running at less than 1%, but that dips in the coming years. Historically, the service has enjoyed annual rises of about 4% to cover the cost of the ageing population and new drugs. A Department of Health spokesman said: ""Research shows spending on the NHS is in line with most other European countries, and the public can be reassured that the government is committed to continued investment in the health service.""

"Sir Andy Murray's wife Kim has given birth to a baby girl. The couple, who married in 2015, already have a daughter, Sophia, who was born in 2016. The news emerged less than 24 hours after Andy Murray attended a charity tennis event at the SSE Hydro in Glasgow. The match against Roger Federer wasthe first time Murray had played in publicsince suffering a hip injury at Wimbledon. The couple's second girl is understood to have been born in England a ""couple of weeks ago"". Both Kim and the new baby are believed to be doing well. Sir Andy's grandmother, Shirley Erskine, told the BBC that she was ""delighted"" and was ""looking forward to a cuddle"". Speaking ahead of a trip to London to meet her new great-granddaughter, she said: ""All's well, which is the main thing. ""She's a little playmate for Sophia, who I'm sure will be equally thrilled."" Mrs Erskine of Dunblane remained tight-lipped on the question of a name for the newest addition to the Murray household. She said: ""I'm sure they've got that all worked out. ""We'll find out this weekend. I don't really know much at the moment because we haven't seen her. But we're looking forward to having a little cuddle and a little play with Sophia, who is running about all over the place and chattering."" When asked if her great-granddaughters would be future Wimbledon partners, Mrs Erskine laughed and said: ""Not in our lifetime unfortunately - but we'd like to think so."" This video can not be played Sir Andy Murray's gran welcomes new child The news was also welcomed by Scotland's first minister. Nicola Sturgeon tweeted: ""Congratulations to Kim and Andy (and to granny @JudyMurray too)."" The couple announced in July that Kim was expecting a second child. At the time Murray spoke about how his family were the most important thing in his life and how becoming a husband and father had helped his tennis.

"Former entertainer Rolf Harris has renewed his application to have his convictions for indecent assault quashed at the Court of Appeal. His lawyers said there was overwhelming evidence to show he wasn't in an area where one of the alleged indecent assaults took place. The 87-year-old is hoping to overturn the 12 indecent assault convictions he was jailed for in 2014. His two-day appeal hearing was heard by three judges at the High Court. The Australian-born TV presenter was sentenced to nearly six years in prison in 2014. He was released in May. He was convicted of 12 indecent assaults against four girls, including one aged eight, which took place between 1968 and 1986. His defence team have put forward new evidence which they claim shows he wasn't at Leigh Park community centre in Hampshire where one girl said she was assaulted in the 1960s. The court heard from two former police officers and the father of one of the victims - who all said Harris was not in that part of Hampshire at the time of the alleged assault. Stephen Vullo QC, representing Harris, said: ""We only need to show one count was unsafe in order to have a retrial."" The prosecution argued that despite these new claims, the force of evidence against him is still there. The three judges will now reach their conclusion which is expected to take two weeks.

"Sadia Ahmed outside court with her lawyer after the verdict A mother has been cleared of murdering her 14-month-old daughter. The charge that Sadia Ahmed, 28, smothered toddler Inaya with a pillow at their home in Drumchapel, Glasgow, on 17 April 2016 was found not proven. Mrs Ahmed had told jurors at the High Court in Glasgow that her daughter choked on a piece of toast. She sat emotionless in the dock as the verdict was returned. But, as she left the court, she broke down in the arms of her mother. Mrs Ahmed later gave a statement through her lawyer Aamer Anwar, in which she said she ""died"" the day she lost Inaya and ""nothing would ever take the pain away"". The statement said: ""The short times I got to spend with my daughter Inaya will forever be the most cherished moments of my life. ""She passed away on the 20th of April last year at an age of just 14 months. The day she was born brought joy to my life, which had become full of such suffering since the day I was married. ""No one can imagine the pain of a mother losing her baby. I will never see her smile again or be able to hold her in my arms. ""The nightmare did not end with her death but continued with being accused of the most horrific crime possible - the murder of one's child, my Inaya."" Inaya died after three days on a life support machine Mrs Ahmed added: ""I loved her more than anything in this world and always will. ""From the outset, I have protested my innocence and am grateful to my legal team for all their hard work and fighting for the right verdict today. But my life is over - I died the day I lost my Inaya. Nothing will ever take that pain away."" After a 21-day trial, the jury of eight women and seven men took just over an hour to find the charge against Mrs Ahmed not proven. Judge Lord Matthews told them: ""It's not meant to be an enjoyable business. At the end of the day, Inaya is dead. It's a terrible tragedy and we had to pick over the bones of it."" Members of the Ahmed family - including the accused mother's husband Suleman - had claimed she confessed to them that she had killed Inaya. The child's grandmother Noor Ahmed claimed her daughter-in-law Sadia Ahmed said she had put the little girl to sleep ""forever"". Scotland, unlike most of the world's legal systems, has three possible verdicts in criminal cases - guilty, not guilty and not proven The legal implications of a not proven verdict are the same as with a not guilty verdict: the accused is acquitted and is innocent in the eyes of the law Not proven is seen by some as offering additional protection to the accused But critics argue that it is confusing for juries and the public, can stigmatise an accused person and fail to provide closure for victims Scottish juries - consisting of 15 people - were historically able to return only proven or not proven verdicts A third verdict of not guilty was introduced in the 1700s and became more commonly used than not proven However, the option of returning a verdict of not proven was never removed In more recent years, the general perception has been that a ""not proven"" verdict suggests a sheriff or jury believes the accused is guilty, but does not have sufficient evidence to convict But several family members also admitted they had lied to police about the death being an accident when officers had been called to investigate the incident. There were also allegations that Mrs Ahmed's parents, who had been in Pakistan at the time, had initially put pressure on her in-laws to lie about Inaya's death. The court had heard that a large extended family lived in the six-bedroom Drumchapel home. A member of the family called police and paramedics to the house a about 11:00 on 17 April last year. They found the toddler's face ""turning blue"" after attempts by relatives to revive her. Inaya was taken to the Royal Hospital for Children and died there on 20 April. The court heard that the cause of death was irreversible brain damage as a result of a lack of blood and oxygen. In a statement, the Ahmed family said their lives had been ""completely shattered"" by Inaya's death. ""There isn't a single moment that goes by where she isn't missed,"" said the statement. ""The last 18 months have been the most difficult in our lives and as a family we have struggled to deal with our loss.

"Around 4,500 people are rough sleeping in the UK, according to the new survey As many as one in 25 people are classed as homeless in the worst-affected areas of England, a new study has shown. Homeless charity Shelter said more than 268,000 people across England are homeless, although the number is a ""conservative estimate"", with many more expected to be going unrecorded. It said the leading cause was the loss of a private tenancy, with three in 10 cases coming as a result. The government said it was ""determined to tackle all forms of homelessness"". Shelter has launched an urgent appeal to raise money for front-line services. Homeless rise 'driven by welfare reforms' Homeless given one-way train tickets More homeless people forced to move away The definition of homelessness under law includes rough sleepers, single people in hostels and those in temporary accommodation. Under these criteria, say Shelter, at least one in 206 people in England is classed as being homeless. Broken down, this results in around 4,100 people sleeping on the streets and at least 242,000 in temporary accommodation. A further 21,000 are either in hostels or being housed temporarily by social services. London has the highest proportion of homelessness in the country, accounting for 31 of the worst hotspots - with the borough of Newham recording one in 25 people as homeless. But other pressure points have also been identified: Luton, where one in 52 are homeless Brighton, where one in 69 fall into the category Birmingham, where the figure is one in 88 The number of temporary accommodation households has risen from 48,330 in 2011 to 78,810 at the start of 2017. Shelter believes at least 35% of those households will still be in unreliable homes in a year's time, showing little end in sight for many. This is partly down to the number of people losing private tenancies, which the charity says has soared since cuts to housing benefits started in 2011. Polly Neate, chief executive of Shelter, is calling for an ""ambitious new direction"" from the government to tackle the issue, saying: ""On a daily basis, we speak to hundreds of people and families who are desperately trying to escape the devastating trap of homelessness. ""[It is] a trap that is tightening thanks to decades of failure to build enough affordable homes and the impact of welfare cuts."" Victoria says she just wants ""a safe place to call home"" At 72 years old, Victoria is homeless after her landlord decided to sell her privately-rented flat and she could not find anywhere to live. The pensioner from London - whose surname we have not used - said that, despite always paying her rent on time, landlords did not want to rent to someone on housing benefit, and many properties in the capital were too expensive for her. ""Presenting myself as homeless was in itself humiliating and scary,"" she said. ""You're left sitting around for hours, waiting to find out if you'll have a place to stay that night."" Victoria is now living in temporary accommodation, but is desperate to find somewhere permanent and ""a safe place to call home"". ""The whole thing makes me feel like there is something wrong with me,"" she said. ""I've moved around a lot, and yet for the first time in my life I feel like I have no control over my situation. ""I'm not easily scared, but the fear is terrible - you just don't know where you are going to end up. I'm in a constant state of anxiety and stress."" Dan Wilson Craw, director of campaign group Generation Rent, said it was ""incredibly easy"" for private tenants to find themselves homeless, as landlords do not need a reason to evict, and called for more restrictions to be put in place. The Local Government Association said homelessness was causing a ""huge challenge"" for councils, with its housing spokesman, Martin Tett, calling for more resources from the government to tackle the issue. But the Department for Communities and Local Government said it was investing Â£950m into supporting efforts to tackle homelessness by 2020, and it had already given more powers to local authorities. A spokesman said: ""We are determined to tackle all forms of homelessness, which includes making sure people in temporary accommodation are getting support to keep a roof over their heads."" Homelessness has been rising rapidly since 2010, but it's difficult to know exactly how many people don't have anywhere to live. Estimates of rough sleepers are calculated by counting people on a single night, and potentially millions of ""sofa surfers"" go under the radar. The charity, Shelter, has pieced together various data sources to arrive at its figure. It used official data on how many households were living in temporary accommodation to calculate how many individual people that equated to. It looked at hostel bed occupancy to include people who turn up without being referred by the council, often paying a fee to stay, who don't appear in official figures. And it asked councils how many homeless families they were accommodating, giving a much higher figure than the 78,180 homeless households usually quoted.

"A girl plays with the Fingerlings toy UK toy retailers are holding out for a busy Christmas after sales fell by 2% in the first nine months of the year. Analysts and retailers expect a flat full year at best for the industry following two consecutive years of rapid growth. Spending on toys totals Â£121 per child up to the age of 11, according to analysts NPD, with lower-income families cutting their spending. The industry has unveiled itslist of ""must-have"" toys,external. Cheaper collectables feature prominently on the list, alongside more traditional games and film and TV tie-ups. Gender specific toys: do you stereotype children? Argos sorry for '3 for 2' toy confusion Frederique Tutt, global industry analyst for the NPD Group's toy division, said that sales had been ""sluggish"" in the year so far, whereas activity had risen in the other major toy markets in Europe, the US and Russia. She pointed to a correction following two years of 7% growth in the UK, which had outstripped other markets and had been driven in part by the success of the Star Wars franchise. Frederique Tutt with one of the Toy Retailers' Association's top toys Seven of the 10 best-selling toys of the year so far have had a price tag of less than Â£10, she said. Some 38% of toy purchases in the UK are made online Nearly two-thirds (61%) of Christmas toys were chosen by the giver, rather than included on Christmas lists A third (34%) of annual spending on toys is at Christmas Source: Toy Retailers' Association/NPD Alan Simpson, chairman of the Toy Retailers' Association, which compiles the Dream Toys list, said the weakness of the pound had pushed up prices in the UK as most toys were imported. The toy market was suffering from the income squeeze of customers as much as other sectors, he added. ""However, the rule book gets thrown away at Christmas, no matter how tough things are [for parents],"" he said. A drone is one toy mirroring the advance of technology Ms Tutt said that this year's list of top toys was relatively low-tech, with traditional games playing a more ""dynamic"" part in the market. ""Parents are saying that too much screen time is not good,"" she said. Only 1% of toys were ""connected"" via the internet, yet the influence of the web - and particularly social media - was clear from the design of new toys. One of the expected best-sellers at Christmas is the L.O.L. Surprise - a heavily wrapped toy inspired by ""unboxing"" videos on YouTube and other social media channels. Marketing for other toys had been launched on social media rather than TV adverts, she said. and manufacturers were counting on shared videos of youngsters playing with their new toys as another form of advertising.

"Priti Patel must be investigated for holding unofficial meetings during a holiday in Israel or ""do the decent thing and resign"", Labour has said. The international development secretary apologised on Tuesday for holding 12 meetings, including one with Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu, on a private trip. In the Commons, Labour's Kate Osamor said it was a ""black and white case"" of the ministerial code being broken. But minister Alistair Burt said policy did not change as a result of the trip. Ms Patel was not in the Commons to face an urgent question about her actions because she is on a pre-arranged visit to Africa, a situation which Labour said was ""simply not acceptable"". The BBC understands Ms Patel suggested some of Britain's aid budget go to the Israeli army, after the visit in August. She asked her officials to see if Britain could support humanitarian operations conducted by the Israeli army in the occupied Golan Heights area. Kuenssberg: A bad day at the office for Theresa May The BBC understands the Foreign Office advised that because Britain did not officially recognise Israel's annexation of the area, it would be hard for the Department for International Development to work there. Speaking in the Commons, Foreign Office minister Alistair Burt defended Ms Patel's ""perfectly legitimate"" right to raise the matter - saying it was within the context of providing medical help for Syrian refugees who could not get assistance in their own country. But he said the idea had been rejected because ministers did not think it would be ""appropriate"". He told MPs that the Foreign Office learned of her visit on 24 August, while she was still in Israel, but after a number of key meetings had already taken place. He said Ms Patel had been ""absolutely contrite"" for ""getting the sequencing wrong"" in terms of informing officials but Mrs May accepted her apology and now regarded the matter ""as closed"". But Labour's Kate Osamor said Ms Patel's actions were covered by the existing code and demanded a probe into what she did during the trip and what action she sought upon her return. The opposition says there are ""strong grounds"" to believe Ms Patel is responsible for ""multiple breaches"" include failing to act in an open and transparent manner, not abiding by the principle of collective responsibility and not being honest about the nature and number of meetings she attended. ""It is hard to think of a more black and white case of breaking the ministerial code,"" Ms Osamor said. ""It is time the secretary of state either faces a Cabinet Office investigation or does the decent thing and just resigns"". The BBC's diplomatic correspondent James Landale said local UK diplomats in Israel probably first became aware of her visit on 24 August because that was when the opposition leader she met, Yair Lapid, first tweeted about their meeting.

The BBC revealed on Friday that Ms Patel held a number of undisclosed meetings with business and political figures, including Mr Lapid, the leader of Israel's centrist Yesh Atid party. No diplomats were present at the meetings, at which the minister was accompanied by an influential pro-Israeli Conservative peer and campaigner, Lord Polak. Ms Patel has admitted how the meetings were set up ""did not accord with the usual procedures"". Former Conservative foreign secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that it was ""extremely unwise"" for Ms Patel to have held secret meetings with Israeli officials. Ms Patel discussed Benjamin Netanyahu's visit to the UK, which took place last week ""Not only did she not tell the Foreign Office directly, so far as I'm aware the British Embassy in Israel wasn't aware that this was happening. Now that just shouldn't be done... it's not just a question of courtesy,"" he said. Lord Ricketts, former head of the diplomatic service, told BBC Radio 4's World Tonight that he couldn't think of a precedent ""where a senior minister visits a country, has an extensive programme like this without the Foreign Office, the foreign secretary or even the ambassador in the country knowing about it"". However International Trade Secretary Liam Fox told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that it was not ""in any way forbidden"" to speak to the prime minister of another country without telling the foreign secretary. He added: ""I find it utterly unsurprising that the international aid secretary would want to talk to charities while she's on holiday in a particular area about whether or not we can use the British aid budget to diminish the humanitarian problems there."" Ms Patel, who is a long-standing supporter of Israel and a former vice-chairman of Conservative Friends of Israel, has admitted a ""lack of precision"" for suggesting last week that Boris Johnson knew about the trip, and that only two meetings had taken place when she attended 12. Downing Street, which has called for the ministerial code to be clarified in this area, said Ms Patel had acknowledged she had behaved in an ""improper way"" and would not do so again.

"Sir Andy Murray's wife Kim has given birth to a baby girl. The couple, who married in 2015, already have a daughter, Sophia, who was born in 2016. The news emerged less than 24 hours after Andy Murray attended a charity tennis event at the SSE Hydro in Glasgow. The match against Roger Federer wasthe first time Murray had played in publicsince suffering a hip injury at Wimbledon. The couple's second girl is understood to have been born in England a ""couple of weeks ago"". Both Kim and the new baby are believed to be doing well. Sir Andy's grandmother, Shirley Erskine, told the BBC that she was ""delighted"" and was ""looking forward to a cuddle"". Speaking ahead of a trip to London to meet her new great-granddaughter, she said: ""All's well, which is the main thing. ""She's a little playmate for Sophia, who I'm sure will be equally thrilled."" Mrs Erskine of Dunblane remained tight-lipped on the question of a name for the newest addition to the Murray household. She said: ""I'm sure they've got that all worked out. ""We'll find out this weekend. I don't really know much at the moment because we haven't seen her. But we're looking forward to having a little cuddle and a little play with Sophia, who is running about all over the place and chattering."" When asked if her great-granddaughters would be future Wimbledon partners, Mrs Erskine laughed and said: ""Not in our lifetime unfortunately - but we'd like to think so."" This video can not be played Sir Andy Murray's gran welcomes new child The news was also welcomed by Scotland's first minister. Nicola Sturgeon tweeted: ""Congratulations to Kim and Andy (and to granny @JudyMurray too)."" The couple announced in July that Kim was expecting a second child.

"Mark van Dongen died 15 months after being attacked in Bristol An acid attack victim has told jurors, in testimony recorded before his death, how the ""jealous"" ex accused of his murder laughed as she doused him in a corrosive liquid. In video evidence, Mark van Dongen, 29, said Berlinah Wallace, 48, shouted ""if I can't have you, no-one else can"" as she threw sulphuric acid at him. Bristol Crown Court heard he ended his life in a euthanasia clinic due to unbearable pain from his injuries. Ms Wallace denies murder. The court heard Dutch national Mr van Dongen was left paralysed from the neck down and lost his left leg, the sight in his left eye and most of the sight in his right eye, after the September 2015 attack in Bristol. He was later told he would require a ""lifetime of constant and dedicated care"". In January this year, he travelled to Belgium where he ended his life in a euthanasia clinic. A picture of Mark van Dongen taken before the attack Jurors were shown the video interview with Mr van Dongen, filmed in hospital in July 2016, where he gave his account of the attack, Trial judge Mrs Justice May warned them they may find the footage, which showed the extent of the scarring to the victim's body, ""shocking and disturbing"". In the video, Mr van Dongen struggles to speak as he describes Ms Wallace waking him up and laughing as she threw acid over him, saying ""if I can't have you, no one else can"". When the interviewer asks if he knew why she had attacked him, he says it was because she was jealous. In a second video shown to the court, Mr van Dongen tells police Ms Wallace threw boiling water over him after an argument in 2014. He also says Ms Wallace hit herself in the face, and told him she would tell police he had caused her injuries if he left her. At the time of the attack, prosecutor Adam Vaitilingam QC told jurors, Mr van Dongen had begun seeing another woman and moved into a hotel. The victim visited the defendant at her flat in Ladysmith Road, Bristol, because he was concerned that she was ""in a bad way and self-harming"", the court was told. He fell asleep, jurors heard, and Ms Wallace laughed as she threw a glass of sulphuric acid over him. The court heard Mr van Dongen ran into the street ""screaming for help"", where neighbours tried to help him, and he was taken to a specialist burns unit at Southmead Hospital. Mr Vaitilingam said: ""The physical and mental suffering that he sustained from that calculated acid attack were what drove him to euthanasia. ""Put simply, he could not bear to live in that condition. ""If that is right, we say, then she is guilty of murder."" Ms Wallace wept in the dock as the jury were told Mr van Dongen was ""genuinely frightened"" of her, and the couple's relationship had become ""volatile"". Berlinah Wallace denies murder and applying a corrosive substance The jury heard computer records showed Ms Wallace had bought the acid online on 2 September. She also carried out internet searches, including ""can I die drinking sulphuric acid?"", and browsed news stories on acid attack victims. Ms Wallace admits throwing a substance over Mr van Dongen but denies any intent to cause him harm. She claims she believed that she was throwing a glass of water over him. Richard Smith QC, defending, told the jury ""to keep an open mind"". ""Yes, she threw the glass over him, but defence claims Mr van Dongen put the acid in the cup without her knowledge, and encouraged her to drink it resulting in a mirror image of what we now have."" He said the couple had a ""turbulent and complicated relationship"" and Ms Wallace was going to blackmail Mr van Dongen with personal information, which was why he put the acid in the glass and encouraged her to drink it. Ms Wallace denies murder and applying a corrosive substance. The trial continues on Thursday.

"This video can not be played Carl Sargeant ""wasn't dealt with fairly"", says Labour AM Jenny Rathbone The family of sacked Welsh Labour minister Carl Sargeant has said he was deprived of ""natural justice"". He was found dead on Tuesday after being sacked from the cabinet and suspended from Labour. He faced allegations of ""unwanted attention, inappropriate touching or groping"". Leighton Andrews, a former key ally of Carwyn Jones, said he is ""angry"" the first minister did TV interviews commenting on allegations. The former AM and cabinet minister said Mr Jones had not followed ""due process"" by speaking to the media on Monday. On Thursday Labour AMs will meet for the first time since Mr Sargeant died. First Minister Carwyn Jones's spokesman said: ""Like everyone in the Welsh Labour family Carwyn is deeply upset by the death of his friend. ""Tomorrow Welsh Labour AMs will meet in the assembly to remember Carl and discuss the tragic events of the past week. Carwyn will make a further statement following the meeting."" Sacked Labour minister found dead Profile of long-serving AM's career Ex-minister 'facing number of claims' Minister removed over conduct claims On Monday Mr Jones told the BBC and ITV there were ""a number"" of allegations made by women against Mr Sargeant. But Mr Andrews told BBC One's Wales Live programmethat he felt the first minister should not have made any public comments after the matter was referred to the Labour Party on Friday. ""Having passed this over on Friday to the Labour party, on Monday the first minister is doing interviews with the BBC and I think with ITV as well in which he is elaborating on the story and commenting on the story,"" he said. ""Well, that is not due process.

""People do not think Carl Sargeant has been treated fairly."" This video can not be played Leighton Andrews said the allegations should have been dealt with ""behind closed doors"" His comments came after Mr Sargeant's family released correspondence between his solicitor and Labour to highlight their concern over his treatment. It shows Mr Sargeant pushed for more specific details on the claims, and that his mental well-being was being affected. Relatives said he was distressed at being unable to defend himself. The Labour Party said that, in line with agreed procedure, the nature of the allegations was outlined to Mr Sargeant. The Alyn and Deeside AM had vowed to clear his name after being sacked as communities secretary by Mr Jones on Friday, but said he did not know the details of the allegations. It is understood he took his own life. A family spokesman said on Wednesday they were publishing the correspondence ""in light of the continued unwillingness"" of the Labour Party ""to clarify the nature of the allegations made against Carl"". ""Up to the point of his tragic death on Tuesday morning Carl was not informed of any of the detail of the allegations against him, despite requests and warnings regarding his mental welfare,"" the spokesman said. ""The correspondence also discloses the solicitor's concern that media appearances by the first minister on Monday were prejudicing the inquiry. ""The family wish to disclose the fact that Carl maintained his innocence and he categorically denied any wrongdoing. ""The distress of not being able to defend himself properly against these unspecified allegations meant he was not afforded common courtesy, decency or natural justice."" In a statement through solicitors later, the family added that they hope ""there will be a full investigation and scrutiny of the way that the relevant parties concerned dealt with the allegations, Mr Sargeant personally and the statements that have been made in the press and media"". ""Those that owed a clear duty of care to Carl and to his family will, no doubt in due course, need to provide clarity on their respective positions in this tragedy,"" they added. ""No support was offered to Mr Sargeant other than that personally offered by close friends and family,"" the family added. Carl Sargeant's family have released two emails and a letter sent between his solicitor and Welsh Labour.

""I think they need some space to try as best they can to come to terms with what has happened to Carl,"" he said.

"Taoiseach Leo Varadkar appeared with the ""Shamrock Poppy"" in parliament The prime minister of the Republic of Ireland has worn an Irish-themed red poppy badge to remember Irish soldiers who fought in World War One. Taoiseach Leo Varadkar appeared with the ""shamrock poppy"" in the DÃ¡il - the parliament in the capital, Dublin. He is the first leader of the Fine Gael political party to do this. The move has triggered debate about how more than 200,000 Irish soldiers who served in the British Army are remembered. Between 1914 and 1918, some 35,000 of them died. ""The Shamrock Poppy recognises Irish soldiers who fought in World War One,"" a spokesman for Mr Varadkar said. ""It was commissioned to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Great War by the Irish branch of the Royal British Legion. ""Proceeds from the Shamrock Poppy go to Irish veterans and their families, and towards the upkeep to memorials to Irish soldiers in Ireland. All money stays in Ireland,"" the spokesman said. The Shamrock Poppy worn by the Irish PM In 2012, Mr Varadkar's predecessor Enda Kenny attended a Remembrance Sunday service in Enniskillen, Northern Ireland. A green shamrock is traditionally used as a symbol of the Irish people. A red poppy - known as the remembrance poppy - has been used in the UK and several other countries to commemorate servicemen and women killed in all conflicts. Neighbours across the sea In April 1916, Irish republicans led an armed insurrection to end British rule. The Anglo-Irish war in 1919-21 led to the partition of Ireland and the creation of the Irish Free State. The Republic of Ireland was declared in 1949.

"Ralph Northam (L) and Ed Gillespie Democrats have scored two significant victories in the US - in the first statewide elections since President Donald Trump came to power in January. In Virginia, Ralph Northam defeated Republican Ed Gillespie in a governorship race marked by tussles on immigration and Confederate statues. Phil Murphy, who beat Kim Guadagno, will be New Jersey governor. The results could give an early indication of how next year's midterm congressional elections will turn out. New York City's Democrat mayor was also comfortably re-elected. Meanwhile, Virginia voters also made history by electing their first openly transgender state legislator. Virginia elects first transgender lawmaker Diverse politicians chosen across the US Democrats have been craving something to celebrate after defeat in four congressional special elections this year, despite a groundswell of grassroots opposition to President Trump. With nearly all the votes countered in Virginia, Mr Northam had 53.9% against 44.9% for Mr Gillespie. Mr Northam, the lieutenant governor of Virginia, will now replace popular Governor Terry McAuliffe, a Democrat. Mr Northam won despite a series of flip-flops during the campaign. Progressive supporters were outraged after Mr Northam reversed stance to say he would oppose any attempt by a Virginia city to provide sanctuary to illegal immigrants. Pain of defeat still lingers for Democrats The Democrat offered to work with President Trump after previously calling him ""a narcissistic maniac"". Mr Northam also vowed to lead efforts to remove Confederate statues, only to say later that he would leave the decision to local authorities. And his camp was further embarrassed by a racially charged advert, released by a group supporting his candidacy. Mr Gillespie, a Washington lobbyist and former Republican party chairman, had accused Mr Northam of failing to curb gang violence and seeking to tear down statues honouring Civil War, pro-slavery secessionists. This video can not be played Virginia election: Ed Gillespie running on Trumpism without Trump Mr Gillespie's style was combative - but he distanced himself from President Trump. Responding to the election result, Mr Trump tweeted that Mr Gillespie ""did not embrace me or what I stand for"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Meanwhile,Virginia voters elected their first openly transgender state legislator in Danica Roem. The 32-year-old journalist and stepmother ousted a long-time, pro-Trump, incumbent Republican in a race that focused on traffic issues. Her rival, Bob Marshall, described himself earlier this year as Virginia's ""chief homophobe"". Virginia voters also made history by electing their first transgender candidate In New Jersey, Mr Murphy was comfortably leading the race with 55.5%. His Republican rival Ms Guadagno has 42.6%, with about 90% of the votes counted. Mr Murphy will replace Republican Chris Christie, who was in office for eight years. Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington Democrats finally have a victory of the non-moral kind. After coming up short in a handful of special elections across the US, they went to the polls in a battleground state and posted a huge win. How the Democrats, from governor candidate Ralph Northam on down, swept through election night in Virginia should be particularly concerning to Republicans across the US. Turnout from Democratic supporters surged. They ran up huge margins with college-educated voters and residents in the wealthy Northern Virginia suburbs. The legions of rural voters who turned out for Donald Trump in 2016 were a non-factor. Democrats won legislative races that were considered to be in play only in the rosiest of Democratic wave scenarios. Exit polls show a plurality of Virginians went to the polls to send a message to Mr Trump. Their top issue was healthcare. At least in Virginia, the president's dismal approval ratings translated into ballot-box poison. The stage is now set for the midterm elections in 2018. Republicans will have a year to brace for what could be an anti-Trump tsunami forming on the horizon. What they - and Mr Trump - do next could decide their fate.

"A child sexual abuse victim has been given an apology from the government's victim compensation agency after it previously ruled he had consented. Twenty-one men were convicted of abusing the man from the age of 13. The man has now been told he is eligible for compensation after his application had originally been rejected by the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority (Cica). The Ministry of Justice says similar cases are now being reviewed. The man - known as HND - had applied to Cica for compensation but Human rights charity Liberty said that was rejected in November 2015, after it was ruled he had consented to the sexual assaults. This case washighlighted in a special edition of File on 4in July. HND's appeal against that decision was due to be heard later this month but Cica chief executive Carole Oatway has now written to him to apologise for the way his case was handled. In the letter, she said: ""I am firmly of the view that you are eligible for compensation. ""It is clear that advantage was taken of your age and vulnerability for the purpose of sexual abuse."" Abuse victims 'failed' by payout scheme Abused children 'denied compensation' Child abuse victim 'told she consented' HND's father welcomed the decision but said ""it should never have come to this"". He added: ""Having spent years coming to terms with what happened to him and that it was not his fault, my son was told by a state body that it was"". This video can not be played The boy's story is told by an actor in this short film The decision comes afterCica issued new guidelines to its staff on grooming cases.,external Debaleena Dasgupta, Liberty's lawyer who represented HND, said her client: ""Should be extremely proud of having triggered changes that will hopefully stop other children and young people going through this. ""None of this would have been possible without his tenacity and strength."" In July, the government promised an urgent review of cases where Cica had rejected claims as victims were deemed to have consented. A coalition of charities, including Barnardos, Victim Support and Liberty, said a Freedom of Information request had revealed that since the Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme was launched in November 2012, nearly 700 child victims of sexual abuse had been refused payments. Sammy Woodhouse was among those child sex abuse victims initially denied compensation The Ministry of Justice estimates around 30 cases per year have been refused compensation on consent grounds. Sammy Woodhouse, who was abused by the leader of a child grooming gang in Rotherham, was among those who were initially denied compensation. Cica said Ms Woodhouse, who was 14 when the grooming started, said she ""consented"". But it later overturned its decision. It is illegal to have sexual activity with anyone under 16 but the authority does not automatically make payments to all victims. Cica said its new guidance was developed to ensure young sexual abuse survivors get the support they are entitled to ""even where sexual activity appears consensual"". The charities said the new guidelines will help to protect victims' rights but they can ""only interpret a broken scheme"" and want the whole system to be reviewed.

"This video can not be played Twelve people were killed and dozens more injured in the 1987 bomb attack A memorial to 12 people killed in an IRA bomb in Enniskillen has been unveiled in an event marking 30 years since the attack. The bomb exploded at the town's cenotaph on 8 November 1987during a Remembrance Sunday ceremony, Eleven people were killed in the bombing. A twelfth victim, Ronnie Hill, slipped into a coma two days afterwards and died 13 years later. The Queen sent a message to those gathered at the anniversary ceremony. She said the memorial was a poignant reminder of a terrible event. The Enniskillen Poppy Day Bomb memorial was unveiled during the ceremony DUP leader Arlene Foster, PSNI Chief Constable George Hamilton and NI Secretary James Brokenshire were among those who attended Wednesday's ceremony at the cenotaph, along with families and relatives of those killed and injured. The head of the Police Service of Northern Ireland, George Hamilton, said it was ""a huge regret to me that no one has ever been brought to justice"" for the Enniskillen bombing. He added: ""My heart goes out to the families today"". Together or apart after IRA atrocity? 'Injuries were horrific - worse came later' After a two-minute silence, the names of the dead were read and 12 bells tolled. This video can not be played Who were the victims of the Enniskillen bombing? Family members and dignitaries laid wreaths at the new memorial. The Ballyreagh Silver Band, who played at the 1987 Remembrance Sunday ceremony, provided music for the ceremony. The service was led by the Reverend David Cupples and the main address was delivered by the Reverend Michael Davidson, whose father was killed in an IRA attack in Belfast in 1979. ""I believe we need more than justice,"" Mr Davidson told those gathered at the memorial service. ""I believe that even if we were to receive the justice we deserve in a legal sense tomorrow, while it might bring some satisfaction, I do not believe it would bring peace or closure. ""We need more than justice - we need healing."" The former first minister Arlene Foster described the atmosphere at Wednesday's service as ""very eerie"". ""There was a lot of silence and people were being very reflective, and, I think, people are being very reflective of the horrific nature of what happened on that day,"" she said. There is controversy over where the memorial will be eventually be placed. In the meantime, it has gone into storage. 'Daddy, I love you' Remembrance Sunday 1987 was a day that the people of Enniskillen would never forget. They bear the scars. The bomb blew out walls, showering the area with debris and burying some people in several feet of rubble. Fast forward 30 years and on Wednesday, families will gather at the new Presbyterian Church hall to remember the horror that brought them together and to reflect on how times have changed for Northern Ireland. Shortly after 10:00 GMT, they made their way just a few yards up the road to the area around the war memorial, remembering those who made that fateful journey in 1987. People were buried in several feet of rubble One of those who set the tone after the bombing was Gordon Wilson, whose daughter Marie was killed and who was himself injured in the attack. He repeated his 20-year-old daughter's final words to him as they both lay in the rubble of the bombing. ""Daddy, I love you very much,"" she said. Mr Wilson said: ""I bear no ill will. Dirty sort of talk is not going to bring her back to life. She was a great wee lassie."" A group called Enniskillen Together was set up to further the cause of reconciliation in the area. The IRA lost support worldwide after the bombing. On Remembrance Day 1997, the leader of the IRA's political wing, Sinn FÃ©in's Gerry Adams, formally apologised for the bombing. The bomb exploded at 10:45 GMT on 8 November 1987. There was no warning given. Those who died in the attack were all Protestant and included three married couples, a reserve police officer and several pensioners. The victims were: Edward Armstrong Wesley and Bertha Armstrong Samuel Gault Kitchener and Jessie Johnston William and Agnes Mullan Johnny Megaw Albertha Quinton Marie Wilson Ronnie Hill DUP leader Arlene Foster and NI Secretary James Brokenshire were among those who gathered for Wednesday's ceremony Following the attack, the Queen sent her ""heartfelt sympathy"" to the people of Enniskillen and the then Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, called it ""utterly barbaric"" and ""a blot on mankind"".

"The International Development Secretary held undisclosed meetings in Israel without telling the Foreign Office while accompanied by an influential pro-Israeli Conservative campaigner, the BBC has learned. Priti Patel met the leader of one of Israel's main political parties and made visits to several organisations where official departmental business was reportedly discussed. According to one source, at least one of the meetings was held at the suggestion of the Israeli ambassador to London. In contrast, British diplomats in Israel were not informed about Ms Patel's plans. Ministers are by convention supposed to tell the Foreign Office when they are conducting official business overseas. Downing Street said Ms Patel was on a private holiday she had paid for herself, during which she took the opportunity to meet people. Ms Pateltold the Guardian,external: ""Boris [Johnson] knew about the visit. The point is that the Foreign Office did know about this, Boris knew about [the trip]. It is not on, it is not on at all. ""I went out there, I paid for it. And there is nothing else to this. It is quite extraordinary. It is for the Foreign Office to go away and explain themselves."" But Labour have called,externalfor an investigation to examine whether Ms Patel breached the ministerial code and rules on lobbying. The meetings took place over two days in August while Ms Patel was on holiday in Israel. No civil servants were present but Ms Patel was accompanied by Lord Polak, honorary president of Conservative Friends of Israel (CFI), an influential lobbying organisation that has access to wealthy party donors. Some ministers and MPs accused Ms Patel of trying to win favour with wealthy pro-Israeli Conservative donors who could fund a potential future leadership campaign. Others accused her of conducting her own ""freelance foreign policy"" on Israel. Ms Patel is a long-standing supporter of Israel and a former vice-chairman of CFI. Ministers also said there was a potential risk that the meetings could have broken the ministerial code of conduct which states that ""ministers must ensure that no conflict arises, or could reasonably be perceived to arise, between their public duties and their private interests, financial or otherwise"". Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu has been in London this week One minister said: ""This is outrageous. She is a Cabinet minister. She just cannot do this. This is about donors and influence."" One former minister said: ""What does it say to the rest of the Middle East if a senior Cabinet minister in charge of Britain's huge aid budget disappears for 48 hours from a family holiday in Israel and is under the wing of a pro-Israeli lobbyist?"" The revelations risk embarrassing the government while the Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, is in London to mark the centenary of the Balfour Declaration, when Britain first gave its support for a national home for the Jewish people. A senior Downing Street source denied Ms Patel had done anything wrong. And a source at the Department for International Development said it was a private holiday paid for by the Secretary of State herself. Foreign Office sources in London - and diplomatic sources in the region - confirmed that Ms Patel had not given them any warning of her visit. One minister said: ""Yes, we did not know about the trip. We were unsighted on it."" Another source said the British consulate in Jerusalem was ""blindsided"" and felt ""slightly bruised"". A third Foreign Office source said: ""We didn't know and would have expected to know, given the meetings she had."" Ms Patel took time out from her family holiday on 24 August to meet Yair Lapid, the leader of Israel's centrist Yesh Atid party, a former finance minister in Mr Netanyahu's coalition government. Mr Lapid tweeted a picture of the meeting, saying it was ""great to meet Priti Patel"" whom he described as ""a true friend of Israel."" Mr Lapid's spokesman confirmed that he had met Ms Patel but refused to say what they discussed. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Ms Patel was accompanied by the Tory peer, Lord Polak. He is now honorary president of Conservative Friends of Israel but for more than 25 years, he was the director of the lobby group. And in that role he had a huge influence on Conservative thinking on the Middle East, including writing speeches for Tory party leaders. Lord Polak told the BBC that he just happened to be on holiday at the same time as Ms Patel. ""We met up for one or two things,"" he said. ""It was the summer holidays. I just joined her for a couple of days, some drinks, some dinner, that kind of thing."" That included the meeting with Mr Lapid: ""He is just an old friend of mine, a personal friend. He is more a journalist than a politician. We just had coffee with him. It wasn't anything formal. It is all very innocent."" Conservative Friends of Israel regularly pays for MPs and peers to visit Israel. But Lord Polak said that Ms Patel paid for the holiday herself and the trip had nothing to do with CFI. The peer said he organised for Ms Patel to visit Israeli firms and charities creating technologies that could be interesting to a Secretary of State for Development. Ms Patel visited Beit Issie Shapiro (BIS), a leading Israeli disability charity and campaign group, where she reportedly discussed the possibility of her department forming a long-term partnership with the organisation.

Jean Judes, executive director of BIS, published a picture on Facebook of Ms Patel visiting her organisation. Mrs Judes wrote: ""As the director of the DFID - UK Department for International Development, Ms Patel expressed interest in a long-term relationship with Beit Issie Shapiro, harnessing Israeli innovation to advance assistive technology for the benefit of people with disabilities in underdeveloped countries. ""We look forward to a strong, fruitful partnership with the DFID to enhance the quality of life of people with disabilities worldwide."" Mrs Judes told the BBC that the Israeli embassy in London had been involved in setting up the visit: ""We reached out. ""We met with the Israeli ambassador in London and he said this is something we should bring to the attention of Priti Patel."" The Israeli embassy in London declined to respond to questions. Lord Polak said Ms Patel also visited Innovation: Africa, an Israeli not-for-profit organisation developing new solar and water technologies for remote African communities. The fear among some Tory MPs is that Ms Patel also used the trip to discuss reducing her department's support for Palestinian groups. The UK currently sends about Â£68m a year to support the Palestinian territories, most of it from DFID's budget. Some of the money is given directly to the Palestinian Authority, the rest through the local UN agency or individual groups. Critics claim that instead of just supporting Palestinian refugees and institutions, the money has also been used to pay salaries to Palestinians jailed for terrorism-related offences. Ms Patel has long been a critic of this funding. She tightened up the guidelines on Palestinian spending last year, focusing more on health and education, but one Foreign Office source said that she had recently tried to go further, presenting a paper to the prime minister and the foreign secretary for yet more restrictions on the funding. ""But they were not particularly impressed by her arguments,"" said one Foreign Office source. Another said: ""She has been trying this for some time. She has been pushing to get her hands on the PA aid budget and we have been pushing back."" Others suggested Ms Patel was getting close to CFI in preparation for a future leadership contest. One Whitehall source said: ""I have always understood it to be part of her leadership ambitions, if she has got people from CFI who are prepared to put money into her."" The BBC sent Ms Patel's office a list of questions concerning the visit to Israel which it declined to answer.

"This video can not be played Carl Sargeant ""wasn't dealt with fairly"", says Labour AM Jenny Rathbone The family of sacked Welsh Labour minister Carl Sargeant has said he was deprived of ""natural justice"". He was found dead on Tuesday after being sacked from the cabinet and suspended from Labour. He faced allegations of ""unwanted attention, inappropriate touching or groping"". Leighton Andrews, a former key ally of Carwyn Jones, said he is ""angry"" the first minister did TV interviews commenting on allegations. The former AM and cabinet minister said Mr Jones had not followed ""due process"" by speaking to the media on Monday. On Thursday Labour AMs will meet for the first time since Mr Sargeant died. First Minister Carwyn Jones's spokesman said: ""Like everyone in the Welsh Labour family Carwyn is deeply upset by the death of his friend. ""Tomorrow Welsh Labour AMs will meet in the assembly to remember Carl and discuss the tragic events of the past week. Carwyn will make a further statement following the meeting."" Sacked Labour minister found dead Profile of long-serving AM's career Ex-minister 'facing number of claims' Minister removed over conduct claims On Monday Mr Jones told the BBC and ITV there were ""a number"" of allegations made by women against Mr Sargeant. But Mr Andrews told BBC One's Wales Live programmethat he felt the first minister should not have made any public comments after the matter was referred to the Labour Party on Friday. ""Having passed this over on Friday to the Labour party, on Monday the first minister is doing interviews with the BBC and I think with ITV as well in which he is elaborating on the story and commenting on the story,"" he said. ""Well, that is not due process. ""I'm very angry at those interviews on Monday and the anger within the Labour Party across Wales and beyond the Labour Party in Carl's local community, people in other political parties, people in no political party. ""People do not think Carl Sargeant has been treated fairly."" This video can not be played Leighton Andrews said the allegations should have been dealt with ""behind closed doors"" His comments came after Mr Sargeant's family released correspondence between his solicitor and Labour to highlight their concern over his treatment. It shows Mr Sargeant pushed for more specific details on the claims, and that his mental well-being was being affected. Relatives said he was distressed at being unable to defend himself. The Labour Party said that, in line with agreed procedure, the nature of the allegations was outlined to Mr Sargeant. The Alyn and Deeside AM had vowed to clear his name after being sacked as communities secretary by Mr Jones on Friday, but said he did not know the details of the allegations. It is understood he took his own life. A family spokesman said on Wednesday they were publishing the correspondence ""in light of the continued unwillingness"" of the Labour Party ""to clarify the nature of the allegations made against Carl"". ""Up to the point of his tragic death on Tuesday morning Carl was not informed of any of the detail of the allegations against him, despite requests and warnings regarding his mental welfare,"" the spokesman said. ""The correspondence also discloses the solicitor's concern that media appearances by the first minister on Monday were prejudicing the inquiry. ""The family wish to disclose the fact that Carl maintained his innocence and he categorically denied any wrongdoing. ""The distress of not being able to defend himself properly against these unspecified allegations meant he was not afforded common courtesy, decency or natural justice."" In a statement through solicitors later, the family added that they hope ""there will be a full investigation and scrutiny of the way that the relevant parties concerned dealt with the allegations, Mr Sargeant personally and the statements that have been made in the press and media"". ""Those that owed a clear duty of care to Carl and to his family will, no doubt in due course, need to provide clarity on their respective positions in this tragedy,"" they added.

"This video can not be played Carl Sargeant ""wasn't dealt with fairly"", says Labour AM Jenny Rathbone The family of sacked Welsh Labour minister Carl Sargeant has said he was deprived of ""natural justice"". He was found dead on Tuesday after being sacked from the cabinet and suspended from Labour. He faced allegations of ""unwanted attention, inappropriate touching or groping"". Leighton Andrews, a former key ally of Carwyn Jones, said he is ""angry"" the first minister did TV interviews commenting on allegations. The former AM and cabinet minister said Mr Jones had not followed ""due process"" by speaking to the media on Monday. On Thursday Labour AMs will meet for the first time since Mr Sargeant died. First Minister Carwyn Jones's spokesman said: ""Like everyone in the Welsh Labour family Carwyn is deeply upset by the death of his friend. ""Tomorrow Welsh Labour AMs will meet in the assembly to remember Carl and discuss the tragic events of the past week. Carwyn will make a further statement following the meeting."" Sacked Labour minister found dead Profile of long-serving AM's career Ex-minister 'facing number of claims' Minister removed over conduct claims On Monday Mr Jones told the BBC and ITV there were ""a number"" of allegations made by women against Mr Sargeant. But Mr Andrews told BBC One's Wales Live programmethat he felt the first minister should not have made any public comments after the matter was referred to the Labour Party on Friday. ""Having passed this over on Friday to the Labour party, on Monday the first minister is doing interviews with the BBC and I think with ITV as well in which he is elaborating on the story and commenting on the story,"" he said. ""Well, that is not due process. ""I'm very angry at those interviews on Monday and the anger within the Labour Party across Wales and beyond the Labour Party in Carl's local community, people in other political parties, people in no political party. ""People do not think Carl Sargeant has been treated fairly."" This video can not be played Leighton Andrews said the allegations should have been dealt with ""behind closed doors"" His comments came after Mr Sargeant's family released correspondence between his solicitor and Labour to highlight their concern over his treatment. It shows Mr Sargeant pushed for more specific details on the claims, and that his mental well-being was being affected. Relatives said he was distressed at being unable to defend himself. The Labour Party said that, in line with agreed procedure, the nature of the allegations was outlined to Mr Sargeant. The Alyn and Deeside AM had vowed to clear his name after being sacked as communities secretary by Mr Jones on Friday, but said he did not know the details of the allegations. It is understood he took his own life. A family spokesman said on Wednesday they were publishing the correspondence ""in light of the continued unwillingness"" of the Labour Party ""to clarify the nature of the allegations made against Carl"". ""Up to the point of his tragic death on Tuesday morning Carl was not informed of any of the detail of the allegations against him, despite requests and warnings regarding his mental welfare,"" the spokesman said. ""The correspondence also discloses the solicitor's concern that media appearances by the first minister on Monday were prejudicing the inquiry. ""The family wish to disclose the fact that Carl maintained his innocence and he categorically denied any wrongdoing. ""The distress of not being able to defend himself properly against these unspecified allegations meant he was not afforded common courtesy, decency or natural justice."" In a statement through solicitors later, the family added that they hope ""there will be a full investigation and scrutiny of the way that the relevant parties concerned dealt with the allegations, Mr Sargeant personally and the statements that have been made in the press and media"". ""Those that owed a clear duty of care to Carl and to his family will, no doubt in due course, need to provide clarity on their respective positions in this tragedy,"" they added.

"Marks and Spencer will open fewer Simply Food shops than expected after same store food sales fell in the first six months of its financial year. Chief executive Steve Rowe said last year the retailer would open 200 Simply Food shops over the next five years. However, M&S said it would ""reposition our food business including slowing our Simply Food store opening plan"". Like-for-like food sales, which exclude new store trade, fell 0.1% with Marks saying it faced ""stronger headwinds"". However, total food sales for the period rose 4.4% driven by new shop openings. M&S said that ""hard-pressed"" consumers were more aware of value and were being ""careful about premium choices"". It added that ""headwinds facing our food business have intensified as competitors have encroached on some of our space with the rapid growth of convenience"". It also said that its profit margins on food had been hit because of rising producer costs, as well as its policy of not passing on price increases to its customers. M&S had planned for 90 new Simply Food shops this year, half of which M&S would open itself, while the rest would be operated by franchisees. It will now open 80 stores, split equally between M&S and its franchise partners. It also expected to open a further 90 Simply Food stores in 2018, but this will also now be reduced. Shares in M&S fell by 1.8% to 321.9p. Losing ground Commenting on M&S's performance in food, Patrick O'Brien, UK research director at GlobalData Retail, said: ""When you compare that to the likes of Tesco, Sainsbury's and Morrisons, whose recent like-for-likes have been around 2% plus, that's a pretty bad performance."" He said that food had been ""a banker"" for M&S in the past. ""For it to be losing ground at a time of inflation is really quite damaging,"" he said. For the group, overall total sales rose by 2.6% to Â£5.1bn, but pre-tax profit fell by 5.3% to Â£219.1m. Like-for-like sales in clothing and homeware fell 0.7%, while total same-store sales declined 0.3%. These figures aren't as bad as some had expected. An increase in full-price clothing and home sales is an encouraging sign. But there are also now challenges in its upmarket food business, which in recent years has been a huge success story for M&S. It had been planning to open around 200 new Simply Food stores by 2019. This is now being scaled back, which seems a sensible move. Marks is now focusing on speeding up its existing store restructuring plans, which involve 105 ""legacy stores"". Six stores, out of 30 earmarked for closure, have already ceased trading and a further two have been relocated this year.  Marks says the transfer of customers to alternative stores has been much higher than expected, giving them the confidence to accelerate their plans. Chief executive Steve Rowe wouldn't be drawn on whether this was now just the start of a much bigger store reduction plan. A lot of retail experts think he needs to go much further than today's update, given the huge structural challenges facing the business. The company will also speed up plans to close or reposition 105 of its stores. Mr Rowe said it would accelerate the closure of 30 M&S shops, convert 40 to Simply Food shops and relocate the remaining sites. Mr Rowe said: ""We have made good progress in remedying the immediate and burning issues at M&S I outlined last year. M&S revealed its Christmas advert this week, starring Paddington Bear ""In clothing and home, early results are encouraging, and in International we now have a profitable and robust business. ""We recognise now that we face stronger headwinds in food, which will be addressed in the year ahead."" M&S also announced that its chief financial officer, Helen Weir, will step down. She will stay on until a successor is found. The retailer declined to comment on current trading, but Ms Weir said the wider market view that trading in October had been difficult was ""valid"". Mr Rowe said that warmer weather had affected demand for coats and jumpers, but he added: ""We will trade Christmas as we always do and we're looking forward to giving our customers a treat.""

"Passengers queue to get on to a Greater Anglia service train Five rail operators have experienced disruption due to strike action by the Rail, Maritime and Transport union. Workers on Southern, Greater Anglia and South Western Railway are striking for 48 hours, while staff on Merseyrail and Northern walked out for 24 hours. The union is in dispute over driver-only operated (DOO) trains, also known as driver-controlled operated (DCO). Aslef, which has also been in dispute with Southern,announced on Wednesday that train drivers had accepted a deal. It means there will be a second safety-trained person on every DOO train, except in exceptional circumstances, gives drivers a five-year pay deal worth 28.5%, and confirms the terms and conditions under which members are employed. The executive committee of the train drivers' union had recommended its members accept the deal, which has no impact on the RMT's continuing industrial action. The RMT described Aslef's deal with Southern as ""shoddy"". Commuters ride a crowded South Western Railway train on the Portsmouth to London line Members of the RMT union, who are mostly conductors, have held a series of strikes on Southern since April 2016 amid concerns over safety and job losses. Changes were introduced on Southern in January making conductors ""on-board supervisors"" and passing responsibility for closing doors to drivers. Industrial action by RMT members has only recently spread to other routes across England. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Southern had said services on most of its routes would operate normally during the 48-hour strike although there would besome alterations,external. However, signalling problems exacerbated changes and led to delays and cancellations during people's commute on Wednesday morning. There were also delays due to trespassers on the line between East Croyden and Clapham and lines between Worthing and Bright were blocked during the evening after a person was hit by a train.

Greater Anglia had said it wouldrun a full service,externalduring the industrial action, using other trained staff in place of conductors. Its plan was approved on Tuesday by the Office of Rail and Road (ORR), which criticised the company's contingency arrangements during a strike last month following an incident in which thedoors on the wrong side of a train were openedat Ipswich station.

A spokeswoman said only ""a handful"" of services had been disrupted due to the strike. South Western Railway (SWR), which only took over the franchise from South West Trains in August, cancelled about 40% of its services. It published acontingency timetable,externalincluding replacement buses on some routes. However, the RMT has voiced its concerns about the various plans. General Secretary Mick Cash said: ""The only way that Greater Anglia can be running these services is through taking serious risks with public safety just as they did during the last phase of strike action. ""Rail companies are training up rail staff who have previously had no rail operational experience to stand in as highly trained guards. ""In some cases staff are being bussed in by other train companies not involved in the dispute, paid a bounty and put up overnight in hotels."" The RMT union is in dispute over driver-only operated trains, also known as driver-controlled operated trains But Richard Dean, Greater Anglia's train service delivery director, stressed that the ORR was satisfied with its arrangements, and that an independent rail safety expert had  concluded that its stand-in conductor training was ""industry best practice"". ""We will never compromise the safety of our customers,"" Mr Dean added. Merseyrail ran areduced train service,externalacross its network during the 24-hour strike, while Northern ran its lessened service, mostly between 07:00 and 19:00 GMT. A spokesman for the Department for Transport said: ""This dispute is not about jobs or safety - employees have been guaranteed jobs and salaries. In fact at Southern Rail, where these changes have already been introduced, there are now more staff on trains. ""The independent rail regulator has said driver-controlled trains, which have been used in this country for more than 30 years, are safe."" Has your journey been affected by the dispute?

"Marks and Spencer will open fewer Simply Food shops than expected after same store food sales fell in the first six months of its financial year. Chief executive Steve Rowe said last year the retailer would open 200 Simply Food shops over the next five years. However, M&S said it would ""reposition our food business including slowing our Simply Food store opening plan"". Like-for-like food sales, which exclude new store trade, fell 0.1% with Marks saying it faced ""stronger headwinds"". However, total food sales for the period rose 4.4% driven by new shop openings. M&S said that ""hard-pressed"" consumers were more aware of value and were being ""careful about premium choices"". It added that ""headwinds facing our food business have intensified as competitors have encroached on some of our space with the rapid growth of convenience"". It also said that its profit margins on food had been hit because of rising producer costs, as well as its policy of not passing on price increases to its customers. M&S had planned for 90 new Simply Food shops this year, half of which M&S would open itself, while the rest would be operated by franchisees. It will now open 80 stores, split equally between M&S and its franchise partners. It also expected to open a further 90 Simply Food stores in 2018, but this will also now be reduced. Shares in M&S fell by 1.8% to 321.9p. Losing ground Commenting on M&S's performance in food, Patrick O'Brien, UK research director at GlobalData Retail, said: ""When you compare that to the likes of Tesco, Sainsbury's and Morrisons, whose recent like-for-likes have been around 2% plus, that's a pretty bad performance."" He said that food had been ""a banker"" for M&S in the past. ""For it to be losing ground at a time of inflation is really quite damaging,"" he said. For the group, overall total sales rose by 2.6% to Â£5.1bn, but pre-tax profit fell by 5.3% to Â£219.1m. Like-for-like sales in clothing and homeware fell 0.7%, while total same-store sales declined 0.3%. These figures aren't as bad as some had expected. An increase in full-price clothing and home sales is an encouraging sign. But there are also now challenges in its upmarket food business, which in recent years has been a huge success story for M&S. It had been planning to open around 200 new Simply Food stores by 2019. This is now being scaled back, which seems a sensible move. Marks is now focusing on speeding up its existing store restructuring plans, which involve 105 ""legacy stores"". Six stores, out of 30 earmarked for closure, have already ceased trading and a further two have been relocated this year.  Marks says the transfer of customers to alternative stores has been much higher than expected, giving them the confidence to accelerate their plans. Chief executive Steve Rowe wouldn't be drawn on whether this was now just the start of a much bigger store reduction plan. A lot of retail experts think he needs to go much further than today's update, given the huge structural challenges facing the business. The company will also speed up plans to close or reposition 105 of its stores. Mr Rowe said it would accelerate the closure of 30 M&S shops, convert 40 to Simply Food shops and relocate the remaining sites. Mr Rowe said: ""We have made good progress in remedying the immediate and burning issues at M&S I outlined last year. M&S revealed its Christmas advert this week, starring Paddington Bear ""In clothing and home, early results are encouraging, and in International we now have a profitable and robust business. ""We recognise now that we face stronger headwinds in food, which will be addressed in the year ahead."" M&S also announced that its chief financial officer, Helen Weir, will step down. She will stay on until a successor is found. The retailer declined to comment on current trading, but Ms Weir said the wider market view that trading in October had been difficult was ""valid"". Mr Rowe said that warmer weather had affected demand for coats and jumpers, but he added: ""We will trade Christmas as we always do and we're looking forward to giving our customers a treat.""

"Emma Young lives in Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire and has three children Thousands of people in England who have the most advanced cancers are surviving for several years after diagnosis, according to new research. Macmillan Cancer Support said it was down to new treatments but warned that living longer with advanced cancer can bring its own difficulties. Emma Young, 39, was diagnosed with breast and bone cancer at 35. ""The not-knowing is the hardest, from scan to scan you don't know how it will be,"" she says. ""From the time you have the scan until you get the results is really hard - 'scanziety' is what we call it."" Her diagnosis in May 2014 was delayed after doctors misdiagnosed her symptoms. Days after being told she had breast cancer she was told it had spread to her bones. Stage 4 cancer is where the disease has already spread to at least one other part of the body - which in many cases cannot be cured. Previously, stage 4 cancer patients often had limited options but Macmillan Cancer Support said the new data showed that new and improved treatments mean it can be ""more 'treatable' and manageable, like other chronic illnesses"". But living longer with stage 4 cancer can bring other issues for patients, says Adrienne Betteley, the charity's specialist adviser for end-of-life care. ""This is really positive news, but living with advanced cancer can be a difficult situation to be in. ""As well as dealing with the physical symptoms of cancer, having multiple hospital appointments, scans and treatment options to contend with, there's also the emotional and psychological impact of having an uncertain future.""  Can't find your health trust?Browse the full list Rather search by typing?Back to search If you can't see the NHS Tracker,click or tap here,external. The way Emma chose to cope was by refusing to let doctors give her a prognosis. ""I said I didn't want to know. If you're given one, you count down to that day and what happens when you get to zero? ""I thought I'd carry on regardless without that hanging over me."" Living longer with stage 4 cancer often means juggling hospital appointments and treatments Emma acknowledges such an approach won't suit everyone but for her, not being given a timescale for her illness meant she could ""carry on as usual"" for her three children. ""My youngest is 10 and I want to live as long as possible - I want to keep life normal for them. ""Our life is completely normal - I still do everything with them regardless of my diagnosis. Even though there are times when I could easily sleep in and it's a struggle to get out of bed every day."" It is the first time that data showing the number of people in England living several years after being diagnosed with stage 4 cancer has been available. The figures are based on people in England who were diagnosed with one of 10 common types of cancer between 2012 and 2013, and were still alive at the end of 2015. The data showed 17,000 people with stage 4 cancer had survived for two years or more. Macmillan Cancer Support says the new figures highlight the changing nature of cancer. The charity warns that these patients often face a complex range of issues, including living with uncertainty over how their cancer will progress, and having to make difficult decisions about potentially life-extending treatment and the effect on their quality of life. Emma's cancer is monitored by scans, and bone-strengthening and hormone treatment. She suffers from fatigue and bone pain, struggles to stand for long, and has had to leave her job as a teaching assistant. She receives personal independence payments (PIPs) which were arranged by a nurse at her hospice when she was first diagnosed although they ran out in the summer. ""I had an absolute nightmare with the PIP forms - they took my car away from me - so I had to walk a half-hour walk to school four times a day."" It took four months to sort out and they have now been awarded indefinitely - something Emma believes should be the case for everyone with stage 4 cancer. She has help from cognitive behavioural therapy sessions at her local hospice ""which has been invaluable"" and she credits really good friends for their constant support. ""You can never get away from the fact you've got cancer but you have to shove it to the back of your mind. It's like a demon that will pop up sometimes - you learn to deal with it and put it back in the box. ""You have to ride the waves of emotion - if you want to have a cry you do that.""

"This video can not be played Paradise Papers: Prince Charlesâ offshore investments revealed Prince Charles campaigned to alter climate-change agreements without disclosing his private estate had an offshore financial interest in what he was promoting, BBC Panorama has found. TheParadise Papersshow the Duchy of Cornwall in 2007 secretly bought shares worth $113,500 in a Bermuda company that would benefit from a rule change. The prince was a friend of a director of Sustainable Forestry Management Ltd. The Duchy of Cornwall says he has no direct involvement in its investments. A Clarence House spokesman said the Prince of Wales had ""certainly never chosen to speak out on a topic simply because of a company that it [the Duchy of Cornwall] may have invested in"". He added: ""In the case of climate change his views are well-known, indeed he has been warning of the threat of global warming to our environment for over 30 years. ""Carbon markets are just one example that the prince has championed since the 1990s and which he continues to promote today."" He added Prince Charles was ""free to offer thoughts and suggestions on a wide range of topics"" and ""cares deeply"" about the issue of climate change but ""it is for others to decide whether to take the advice"". Sir Alistair Graham, former chairman of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, said Prince Charles's actions amounted to a serious conflict of interest. He said: ""There's a conflict of interest between his own investments of the Duchy of Cornwall and what he's trying to achieve publicly. ""And I think it's unfortunate that somebody of his importance, of his influence, becomes involved in such a serious conflict."" Tycoon made $41m from âpeopleâs fundâ Paradise Papers: All you need to know Owner avoided taxes on shopping centre The leaked documents held by law firm Appleby show the Duchy of Cornwall also made offshore investments totalling $3.9m in four funds in the Cayman Islands in 2007. This is legal and there is no suggestion of tax avoidance. A Duchy of Cornwall spokesman said Prince Charles voluntarily pays income tax on any revenue from his estate. He added the estate's investments ""do not derive any tax advantage whatsoever based on their location or any other aspect of their structure and there is no loss of revenue to HMRC as a result"". The prince began campaigning for changes to two important environmental agreements weeks after Sustainable Forestry Management (SFM) sent his office lobbying documents. Prince Charles's estate almost tripled its money in just over a year although it is not clear what caused the rise in the share value. Despite his high profile campaign, the environmental agreements were not changed. The documents reveal theDuchy of Cornwall, an Â£896m private estate that provides Prince Charles with an income,externaland which he is said to be ""actively involved"" in running, bought the shares in February 2007.  At the time $113,500 was worth about Â£58,000. One of SFM's directors was the late Hugh van Cutsem, a millionaire banker and conservationist who has been described as the one of the Prince's closest friends. The minutes of a company board meeting that approved the Duchy's shareholding say: ""The Chairman thanked Mr van Cutsem for his introduction of the Duchy of Cornwall and the Board unanimously agreed that the subscription by the Duchy of Cornwall be kept confidential except in respect of any disclosure required by law."" The island that swapped donkey rides for offshore cash Paradise Papers revelations around the world Apple's secret tax bolthole revealed SFM traded in carbon credits, a market created by international treaties to tackle global warming. It wanted to trade in credits from ""tropical and subtropical forests"" but was hampered by two important climate change agreements, the EU's Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) and the Kyoto Protocol, which largely excluded carbon credits from rainforests. When the Duchy bought its shares, SFM was lobbying for a ""change in policy"" on carbon credits, the documents show. It had hired the US former lead negotiator on the Kyoto Protocol, Stuart Eizenstat ""to lobby for inclusion of forest carbon credits"" in new US and EU laws and regulations. Board minutes from February 2007 show SFM was also taking ""steps to influence events to support forest credits"" ahead of Kyoto Protocol meetings at the end of the year. On 6 June 2007, four months after the Duchy bought its shares, Mr van Cutsem asked SFM's chairman to send lobbying documents to the office of the prince. Under the heading ""public policy and advocacy"", minutes of a board meeting held in Paris say ""the chairman referred the committee to the bundle of materials which had been prepared by the company for various policymakers... Mr van Cutsem... asked that a set of documents be prepared for the Prince of Wales office. The chairman undertook to do so"". Four weeks later, on 2 July,Prince Charles, made a speech that criticised the EU ETS and Kyoto Protocol,externalfor excluding carbon credits from rainforests, and called for change. Speaking at the Business in the Community Awards Dinner, the prince said: ""As the Kyoto protocol now stands tropical rainforest nations have no way of earning credits from their standing forests other than by cutting them down and planting new ones,"" he said. ""The European Carbon Trading Scheme excludes carbon credits for forests from developing nations. This has got be wrong and we must urge the international community to work together to redress these failings urgently."" The campaigning was taking place ahead of meetings about the Kyoto Protocol In October 2007, he launched thePrince's Rainforests Project,external, which aimed to ""increase global recognition of the contribution of tropical deforestation to climate change and to find ways to make the rainforests worth more alive than dead."" In aspeech to mark the launch,external, he said: ""The Kyoto Protocol does not have a mechanism to protect standing rainforests. ""Credits are available for afforestation and reforestation projects, but not for maintaining an old growth forest. And the European Trading Scheme excludes carbon credits for forestry in developing nations altogetherâ¦ surely we have to accept that the pressing urgency of climate change requires a response that embraces rather than excludes primary tropical forests?"" Panorama has been unable to find evidence of any speeches the prince made before 2008 about changing Kyoto and EU ETS to include carbon credits for rainforests. The programme asked the prince's office for any such speeches but they did not respond. Over the next six months, the future king made further speeches and videos about rainforests. In avideo released in January 2008,external, the prince said: ""The immediate priority, I believe, is the need to develop a new credit market which will give a true value to carbon and the ecosystem services the rainforests provide the rest of the world."" Lewis Hamilton 'dodged' VAT on private jet Mrs Brown's Boys stars 'put Â£2m offshore' Bono linked to tax probe in Lithuania In February 2008, he reportedly discussed rainforests at a private meeting with the then Prime Minister Gordon Brown. Days later, he met with the then President of the European Commission, Jose Manuel Barroso, and the EU's environment, energy, trade and agriculture commissioners. In aspeech to 150 MEPs,external, he said: ""I have great hopes that the next version of the European Emissions Trading scheme might extend the helping and very visible hand of a market approach to assist in keeping the rainforests standingâ¦ the lives of billions of people depend on your response and none of us will be forgiven by our children and grandchildren if we falter and fail."" On 18 June 2008, as the global financial crash was beginning, the Duchy sold its stake in SFM. The documents show it was paid $325,000 for the 50 shares. SFM is no longer in existence. This video can not be played Sir Alistair Graham says Prince Charles should be accountable to public scrutiny The Duchy was established in 1337 and uses the income to fund the public, private and charitable activities of the Prince of Wales and his children.

"Sky has threatened to shut down Sky News if the news channel proves to be an obstacle in Rupert Murdoch's 21st Century Fox bid. Regulators are investigating the deal amid concerns that Mr Murdoch's media empire could become too powerful. Sky toldthe Competition and Markets Authority (CMA),externalthat the regulator should not assume ""the continued provision"" of Sky News. BBC media editor Amol Rajan said it was a ""credible threat"". Fox owns 39% of Sky but wants full control of the satellite broadcaster. In a submission made to the CMA last month, but published by the regulator on Tuesday, Sky said it ""would likely be prompted to review"" its position if ""the continued provision of Sky News in its current form unduly impeded merger and/or other corporate opportunities available in relation to Sky's broader business"". This would particularly be the case if shareholders objected to the merger not happening, Sky said. Closing Sky News would only be an option of last resort, and the broadcaster would try to find a buyer for the media company before that eventuality, the BBC understands. ""The messaging coming through is alarming for supporters of Sky News but it runs completely counter to all the investment that there has been in the channel in all the recent months and years,"" said Joey Jones, a political correspondent at Sky News for 16 years and now head of public affairs at PR firm Weber Shandwick. But he said the threat was a risky move by Sky: ""Inevitably this will be perceived by those who are already hostile to the proposed takeover, particularly in the political arena, as sabre rattling and as a perceived threat by the company"". Media editor Mr Rajan said that Sky News lost ""an awful lot of money"". ""It loses tens of millions of pounds, and I think the independent directors of Sky are sending a very clear message... that if they had to choose, maybe they'd prefer for commercial reasons to do the deal with 21st Century Fox rather than continue to fund the losses at Sky News."" Probe into Murdoch's Sky bid confirmed What are the issues in Fox's Sky deal? The submission comes a day after reports that Fox has discussed selling ""most"" of its business,including its Sky stake, to Disney. Fox has faced a number of hurdles in its bid to buy Sky, including the CMA investigation and opposition from some politicians. Some fear the deal would give Rupert Murdoch's family too much control over the UK media. The Murdoch family owns controlling stakes in both News Corporation, which owns UK newspapers such as the Sun and the Times, as well as Fox, which operates in film and TV.

"This video can not be played Carl Sargeant ""wasn't dealt with fairly"", says Labour AM Jenny Rathbone The family of sacked Welsh Labour minister Carl Sargeant has said he was deprived of ""natural justice"". He was found dead on Tuesday after being sacked from the cabinet and suspended from Labour. He faced allegations of ""unwanted attention, inappropriate touching or groping"". Leighton Andrews, a former key ally of Carwyn Jones, said he is ""angry"" the first minister did TV interviews commenting on allegations. The former AM and cabinet minister said Mr Jones had not followed ""due process"" by speaking to the media on Monday. On Thursday Labour AMs will meet for the first time since Mr Sargeant died. First Minister Carwyn Jones's spokesman said: ""Like everyone in the Welsh Labour family Carwyn is deeply upset by the death of his friend. ""Tomorrow Welsh Labour AMs will meet in the assembly to remember Carl and discuss the tragic events of the past week. Carwyn will make a further statement following the meeting."" Sacked Labour minister found dead Profile of long-serving AM's career Ex-minister 'facing number of claims' Minister removed over conduct claims On Monday Mr Jones told the BBC and ITV there were ""a number"" of allegations made by women against Mr Sargeant. But Mr Andrews told BBC One's Wales Live programmethat he felt the first minister should not have made any public comments after the matter was referred to the Labour Party on Friday. ""Having passed this over on Friday to the Labour party, on Monday the first minister is doing interviews with the BBC and I think with ITV as well in which he is elaborating on the story and commenting on the story,"" he said. ""Well, that is not due process. ""I'm very angry at those interviews on Monday and the anger within the Labour Party across Wales and beyond the Labour Party in Carl's local community, people in other political parties, people in no political party. ""People do not think Carl Sargeant has been treated fairly."" This video can not be played Leighton Andrews said the allegations should have been dealt with ""behind closed doors"" His comments came after Mr Sargeant's family released correspondence between his solicitor and Labour to highlight their concern over his treatment. It shows Mr Sargeant pushed for more specific details on the claims, and that his mental well-being was being affected. Relatives said he was distressed at being unable to defend himself. The Labour Party said that, in line with agreed procedure, the nature of the allegations was outlined to Mr Sargeant. The Alyn and Deeside AM had vowed to clear his name after being sacked as communities secretary by Mr Jones on Friday, but said he did not know the details of the allegations. It is understood he took his own life. A family spokesman said on Wednesday they were publishing the correspondence ""in light of the continued unwillingness"" of the Labour Party ""to clarify the nature of the allegations made against Carl"". ""Up to the point of his tragic death on Tuesday morning Carl was not informed of any of the detail of the allegations against him, despite requests and warnings regarding his mental welfare,"" the spokesman said. ""The correspondence also discloses the solicitor's concern that media appearances by the first minister on Monday were prejudicing the inquiry. ""The family wish to disclose the fact that Carl maintained his innocence and he categorically denied any wrongdoing. ""The distress of not being able to defend himself properly against these unspecified allegations meant he was not afforded common courtesy, decency or natural justice."" In a statement through solicitors later, the family added that they hope ""there will be a full investigation and scrutiny of the way that the relevant parties concerned dealt with the allegations, Mr Sargeant personally and the statements that have been made in the press and media"". ""Those that owed a clear duty of care to Carl and to his family will, no doubt in due course, need to provide clarity on their respective positions in this tragedy,"" they added. ""No support was offered to Mr Sargeant other than that personally offered by close friends and family,"" the family added. Carl Sargeant's family have released two emails and a letter sent between his solicitor and Welsh Labour. It includes: An email from his solicitor that alleges First Minister Carwyn Jones prejudiced ""what is allegedly an independent enquiry"" by Labour A letter that said he was accused of ""unwanted attention, inappropriate touching or groping"" - allegations Mr Sargeant had denied Read the correspondencehere This video can not be played MP Mark Tami says if procedures were followed in the run-up to Carl Sargeant's death something had gone ""badly wrong"" Mr Sargeant's Westminster constituency colleague, Labour MP Mark Tami, said Mr Sargeant's family were ""angry"" because ""they obviously have questions about the process and how it has ended up with this"". ""I think they need some space to try as best they can to come to terms with what has happened to Carl,"" he said. ""If the procedure's been followed then we need to look at the procedure because something's gone badly wrong."" The first minister is facing questions from within his own party about how the situation was handled, after finding out about the allegations early last week. Staff from his office, but not civil servants, spoke to the women involved and referred their complaints to Welsh Labour, which was investigating, and suspended Mr Sargeant. Allow Twitter content?

UKIP Wales leader Neil Hamilton called on Mr Jones to resign, saying he ""failed to fulfil his duty of care"" to Mr Sargeant. Brecon and Radnorshire Conservative MP Chris Davies also called on the first minister to resign, saying the way he had handled the matter was ""terrible"". What did Carwyn Jones know about allegations of misconduct against Carl Sargeant - and when? In a television interview two days ago, the day before the death of the ex-cabinet secretary, Carwyn Jones insisted that the first time he heard of the allegations was last week. But multiple sources from more than one party have told me that Carwyn Jones had discussed allegations of misconduct with Carl Sargeant once before, and had received an explanation of the incident. Are the sources right? The simple answer is I do not know. But Carwyn Jones knows the truth and he should answer the question as soon as possible.

"SSE has confirmed it is merging its British domestic business with Npower to form a new energy company. SSE, the UK's second-largest energy supplier, which also reported a big fall in its adjusted pre-tax profits of 13.9% in the six months to September,revealed the merger talks on Tuesday. The deal knocks the country's ""Big Six"" energy firms down to five. ""We are very proud of what we've delivered over many years,"" said chief executive Alistair Phillips-Davies. He said the merger would allow both to ""focus more acutely on pursuing their own dedicated strategies"". The new firm is expected to be roughly the size of market leader British Gas and to serve about 11.5 million customers. The news comes less than a month afterthe government published draft legislation to lower the cost of energy bills. However, SSE retail's chief operating officer, Tony Keeling, denied that was the reason for the merger. ""We've been looking for well over a year about what we should do,""he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.""We've listened to government regulators and customers and understand that the market needs to transform and we're absolutely committed to doing that. ""By merging SSE's retail business with Npower's retail business to form a new organisation, we think we can be more efficient, more agile and more innovative for customers."" The deal could fall under the jurisdiction of the Competition and Markets Authority if it progresses beyond its current stage, but Mr Keeling added: ""We think it is very good for competition and customers. There are over 60 people competing in the market and if you look back to 2011, there were only eight."" Innogy's chief executive officer, Peter Terium, agreed the price cap was not the reason for the merger but did concede it may ""have pushed it a bit quicker"". He added that while ""great progress"" had been made in restructuring Npower over the past two years, ""it is clear that Npower would be better placed to offer value to our customers and our shareholders as part of a new company"". SSE's shareholders will hold 65.6% of the new company, with Innogy, which owns Npower, holding the rest. Innogy will also receive a break fee of Â£60m if SSE's shareholders fail to approve the deal by 31 July 2018. In a statement, SSE said the new firm was expected ""to deliver enhanced value"" and that savings in costs and combined IT platforms would ""ultimately enable the company to be an efficient competitor in its markets"". It added that no final decision on the implications for employees would be taken without talks with their representative bodies. Mr Keeling added: ""We're proud of our track record in customer service and have plenty to build on. ""But there is a huge amount of competition and we need to do more than ever to compete by providing value for money and excellent experiences for customers. ""We have an exciting opportunity to create a major new independent supplier with a single-minded focus on customers."" Meanwhile, regulator Ofgem has welcomed SSE's announcement that its electricity networks division will make a voluntary contribution of Â£65.1m to consumers.

"Passengers queue to get on to a Greater Anglia service train Five rail operators have experienced disruption due to strike action by the Rail, Maritime and Transport union. Workers on Southern, Greater Anglia and South Western Railway are striking for 48 hours, while staff on Merseyrail and Northern walked out for 24 hours. The union is in dispute over driver-only operated (DOO) trains, also known as driver-controlled operated (DCO). Aslef, which has also been in dispute with Southern,announced on Wednesday that train drivers had accepted a deal. It means there will be a second safety-trained person on every DOO train, except in exceptional circumstances, gives drivers a five-year pay deal worth 28.5%, and confirms the terms and conditions under which members are employed. The executive committee of the train drivers' union had recommended its members accept the deal, which has no impact on the RMT's continuing industrial action. The RMT described Aslef's deal with Southern as ""shoddy"". Commuters ride a crowded South Western Railway train on the Portsmouth to London line Members of the RMT union, who are mostly conductors, have held a series of strikes on Southern since April 2016 amid concerns over safety and job losses. Changes were introduced on Southern in January making conductors ""on-board supervisors"" and passing responsibility for closing doors to drivers. Industrial action by RMT members has only recently spread to other routes across England. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Southern had said services on most of its routes would operate normally during the 48-hour strike although there would besome alterations,external. However, signalling problems exacerbated changes and led to delays and cancellations during people's commute on Wednesday morning. There were also delays due to trespassers on the line between East Croyden and Clapham and lines between Worthing and Bright were blocked during the evening after a person was hit by a train.

Greater Anglia had said it wouldrun a full service,externalduring the industrial action, using other trained staff in place of conductors. Its plan was approved on Tuesday by the Office of Rail and Road (ORR), which criticised the company's contingency arrangements during a strike last month following an incident in which thedoors on the wrong side of a train were openedat Ipswich station.

A spokeswoman said only ""a handful"" of services had been disrupted due to the strike. South Western Railway (SWR), which only took over the franchise from South West Trains in August, cancelled about 40% of its services. It published acontingency timetable,externalincluding replacement buses on some routes. However, the RMT has voiced its concerns about the various plans. General Secretary Mick Cash said: ""The only way that Greater Anglia can be running these services is through taking serious risks with public safety just as they did during the last phase of strike action. ""Rail companies are training up rail staff who have previously had no rail operational experience to stand in as highly trained guards. ""In some cases staff are being bussed in by other train companies not involved in the dispute, paid a bounty and put up overnight in hotels."" The RMT union is in dispute over driver-only operated trains, also known as driver-controlled operated trains But Richard Dean, Greater Anglia's train service delivery director, stressed that the ORR was satisfied with its arrangements, and that an independent rail safety expert had  concluded that its stand-in conductor training was ""industry best practice"". ""We will never compromise the safety of our customers,"" Mr Dean added. Merseyrail ran areduced train service,externalacross its network during the 24-hour strike, while Northern ran its lessened service, mostly between 07:00 and 19:00 GMT. A spokesman for the Department for Transport said: ""This dispute is not about jobs or safety - employees have been guaranteed jobs and salaries. In fact at Southern Rail, where these changes have already been introduced, there are now more staff on trains. ""The independent rail regulator has said driver-controlled trains, which have been used in this country for more than 30 years, are safe."" Has your journey been affected by the dispute?

"Marks and Spencer will open fewer Simply Food shops than expected after same store food sales fell in the first six months of its financial year. Chief executive Steve Rowe said last year the retailer would open 200 Simply Food shops over the next five years. However, M&S said it would ""reposition our food business including slowing our Simply Food store opening plan"". Like-for-like food sales, which exclude new store trade, fell 0.1% with Marks saying it faced ""stronger headwinds"". However, total food sales for the period rose 4.4% driven by new shop openings. M&S said that ""hard-pressed"" consumers were more aware of value and were being ""careful about premium choices"". It added that ""headwinds facing our food business have intensified as competitors have encroached on some of our space with the rapid growth of convenience"". It also said that its profit margins on food had been hit because of rising producer costs, as well as its policy of not passing on price increases to its customers. M&S had planned for 90 new Simply Food shops this year, half of which M&S would open itself, while the rest would be operated by franchisees. It will now open 80 stores, split equally between M&S and its franchise partners. It also expected to open a further 90 Simply Food stores in 2018, but this will also now be reduced. Shares in M&S fell by 1.8% to 321.9p. Losing ground Commenting on M&S's performance in food, Patrick O'Brien, UK research director at GlobalData Retail, said: ""When you compare that to the likes of Tesco, Sainsbury's and Morrisons, whose recent like-for-likes have been around 2% plus, that's a pretty bad performance."" He said that food had been ""a banker"" for M&S in the past. ""For it to be losing ground at a time of inflation is really quite damaging,"" he said. For the group, overall total sales rose by 2.6% to Â£5.1bn, but pre-tax profit fell by 5.3% to Â£219.1m. Like-for-like sales in clothing and homeware fell 0.7%, while total same-store sales declined 0.3%. These figures aren't as bad as some had expected. An increase in full-price clothing and home sales is an encouraging sign. But there are also now challenges in its upmarket food business, which in recent years has been a huge success story for M&S. It had been planning to open around 200 new Simply Food stores by 2019. This is now being scaled back, which seems a sensible move. Marks is now focusing on speeding up its existing store restructuring plans, which involve 105 ""legacy stores"". Six stores, out of 30 earmarked for closure, have already ceased trading and a further two have been relocated this year.  Marks says the transfer of customers to alternative stores has been much higher than expected, giving them the confidence to accelerate their plans. Chief executive Steve Rowe wouldn't be drawn on whether this was now just the start of a much bigger store reduction plan. A lot of retail experts think he needs to go much further than today's update, given the huge structural challenges facing the business. The company will also speed up plans to close or reposition 105 of its stores. Mr Rowe said it would accelerate the closure of 30 M&S shops, convert 40 to Simply Food shops and relocate the remaining sites. Mr Rowe said: ""We have made good progress in remedying the immediate and burning issues at M&S I outlined last year. M&S revealed its Christmas advert this week, starring Paddington Bear ""In clothing and home, early results are encouraging, and in International we now have a profitable and robust business. ""We recognise now that we face stronger headwinds in food, which will be addressed in the year ahead."" M&S also announced that its chief financial officer, Helen Weir, will step down. She will stay on until a successor is found. The retailer declined to comment on current trading, but Ms Weir said the wider market view that trading in October had been difficult was ""valid"". Mr Rowe said that warmer weather had affected demand for coats and jumpers, but he added: ""We will trade Christmas as we always do and we're looking forward to giving our customers a treat.""

Staff from his office, but not civil servants, spoke to the women involved and referred their complaints to Welsh Labour, which was investigating, and suspended Mr Sargeant. Allow Twitter content?

Jenny Rathbone, Labour AM for Cardiff Central, said she felt Mr Sargeant ""wasn't dealt with fairly"". ""If allegations are made against you, you must know what they are so that you can respond to them,"" she said on BBC Radio Wales' Good Morning Wales programme. UKIP Wales leader Neil Hamilton called on Mr Jones to resign, saying he ""failed to fulfil his duty of care"" to Mr Sargeant. Brecon and Radnorshire Conservative MP Chris Davies also called on the first minister to resign, saying the way he had handled the matter was ""terrible"". What did Carwyn Jones know about allegations of misconduct against Carl Sargeant - and when? In a television interview two days ago, the day before the death of the ex-cabinet secretary, Carwyn Jones insisted that the first time he heard of the allegations was last week. But multiple sources from more than one party have told me that Carwyn Jones had discussed allegations of misconduct with Carl Sargeant once before, and had received an explanation of the incident. Are the sources right? The simple answer is I do not know. But Carwyn Jones knows the truth and he should answer the question as soon as possible.

"This video can not be played Trump to N Korea: 'Your weapons are not making you safer' US President Donald Trump has issued a blunt warning to North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un in an address to South Korea's parliament. ""Do not underestimate us. Do not try us,"" he said, while also condemning the ""dark fantasy"" of life in the North. He addressed Mr Kim saying ""the weapons you are acquiring are not making you safer"", and urged other nations to join forces to stop Pyongyang. The US leader is now in China as part of a five-nation tour of Asia. He will meet Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping for talks likely to focus on trade and North Korea. Pyongyang's nuclear ambitions have been high on Mr Trump's agenda throughout this trip. Over the past year North Korea has carried out missile tests in defiance of UN sanctions and in September conducted its sixth and biggest nuclear test. Trump vows to tackle N Korea on Asia trip N Korea: Where is the war of words heading? North Korea crisis explained in 300 words Mr Trump's words to South Korean lawmakers were being closely watched and while his rhetoric was stark, he did not repeat his previous bombast towards the North. These are the most striking points from his speech: In an unexpected move, Mr Trump chose to directly address North Korea's leader in his speech, urging him to discard his nuclear programme and weapons. ""They are putting your regime in grave danger,"" warned Mr Trump. ""Every step you take down this dark path increases the peril you face."" This video can not be played How could war with North Korea unfold? He also made reference to North Korea's founder and Mr Kim's grandfather, Kim Il-sung, in words likely to inflame Pyongyang. ""North Korea is not the paradise your grandfather envisioned.  It is a hell that no person deserves."" But Mr Trump also appeared toreiterate Tuesday's offerto reach a deal, saying that ""despite every crime you've committed... we will offer you a path for a better future"". He said that to interpret past US restraint as weakness ""would be a fatal miscalculation"", as there was now a different US administration in place. ""Today, I hope I speak not only for our countries but for all civilised nations, when I say to the North: 'Do not underestimate us. Do not try us'."" This video can not be played South Korean villagers voice anger over THAAD He pointed to the heavy US military presence in the Korean peninsula including aircraft carriers and fighter jets, saying: ""I want peace through strength."" But he also made sure to single out North Korea's biggest economic supporter, China, as well as Russia, calling on them to sever all ties including economic ones. After the ""rocket man"" and ""fire and fury"", nobody knew quite what to expect from Donald Trump today. In the end, those in the administration urging him to tone down his rhetoric carried sway. The speech was a warning but not a rush to war. He pushed China and Russia to up their pressure on North Korea. The horror stories of daily life in the North were effective, particularly when compared to liberal South Korea. And the olive branch to Kim Jong-un was the most concrete offer Mr Trump has made yet to the regime. The problem is: there's virtually no chance that the condition for talks - denuclearisation - will be accepted. Having seen what happened to the leaders of Libya and Iraq, North Korea feels only nuclear weapons will guarantee regime survival. The hermit state will have blocked its population from listening to Mr Trump. Optimists now say at least there's been no weapons test since September. But the fact that's seen as progress shows how low the bar now is. Mr Trump spent a significant portion of his speech paying tribute to the achievements of the South since the Korean War, which cemented the division of North and South Korea. After his speech, Mr Trump and his wife visited Seoul's National Cemetery which honours the war dead He contrasted this with the ""horror of life"" in North Korea and said their separate trajectories were ""a tragic experiment in the laboratory of history"". ""The more successful South Korea becomes, the more decisively you discredit the dark fantasy at the heart of the Kim regime,"" he told lawmakers. While listing South Korea's achievements, Mr Trump also spent considerable time noting its prowess in the golfing world, saying its players are ""some of the best on Earth"". Mr Trump, an avid fan of the sport, played in Japan earlier in his Asian tour. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Ralph Northam (L) and Ed Gillespie Democrats have scored two significant victories in the US - in the first statewide elections since President Donald Trump came to power in January. In Virginia, Ralph Northam defeated Republican Ed Gillespie in a governorship race marked by tussles on immigration and Confederate statues. Phil Murphy, who beat Kim Guadagno, will be New Jersey governor. The results could give an early indication of how next year's midterm congressional elections will turn out. New York City's Democrat mayor was also comfortably re-elected. Meanwhile, Virginia voters also made history by electing their first openly transgender state legislator. Virginia elects first transgender lawmaker Diverse politicians chosen across the US Democrats have been craving something to celebrate after defeat in four congressional special elections this year, despite a groundswell of grassroots opposition to President Trump. With nearly all the votes countered in Virginia, Mr Northam had 53.9% against 44.9% for Mr Gillespie. Mr Northam, the lieutenant governor of Virginia, will now replace popular Governor Terry McAuliffe, a Democrat. Mr Northam won despite a series of flip-flops during the campaign. Progressive supporters were outraged after Mr Northam reversed stance to say he would oppose any attempt by a Virginia city to provide sanctuary to illegal immigrants. Pain of defeat still lingers for Democrats The Democrat offered to work with President Trump after previously calling him ""a narcissistic maniac"". Mr Northam also vowed to lead efforts to remove Confederate statues, only to say later that he would leave the decision to local authorities. And his camp was further embarrassed by a racially charged advert, released by a group supporting his candidacy. Mr Gillespie, a Washington lobbyist and former Republican party chairman, had accused Mr Northam of failing to curb gang violence and seeking to tear down statues honouring Civil War, pro-slavery secessionists. This video can not be played Virginia election: Ed Gillespie running on Trumpism without Trump Mr Gillespie's style was combative - but he distanced himself from President Trump. Responding to the election result, Mr Trump tweeted that Mr Gillespie ""did not embrace me or what I stand for"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Meanwhile,Virginia voters elected their first openly transgender state legislator in Danica Roem. The 32-year-old journalist and stepmother ousted a long-time, pro-Trump, incumbent Republican in a race that focused on traffic issues. Her rival, Bob Marshall, described himself earlier this year as Virginia's ""chief homophobe"". Virginia voters also made history by electing their first transgender candidate In New Jersey, Mr Murphy was comfortably leading the race with 55.5%. His Republican rival Ms Guadagno has 42.6%, with about 90% of the votes counted. Mr Murphy will replace Republican Chris Christie, who was in office for eight years. Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington Democrats finally have a victory of the non-moral kind. After coming up short in a handful of special elections across the US, they went to the polls in a battleground state and posted a huge win. How the Democrats, from governor candidate Ralph Northam on down, swept through election night in Virginia should be particularly concerning to Republicans across the US. Turnout from Democratic supporters surged. They ran up huge margins with college-educated voters and residents in the wealthy Northern Virginia suburbs. The legions of rural voters who turned out for Donald Trump in 2016 were a non-factor. Democrats won legislative races that were considered to be in play only in the rosiest of Democratic wave scenarios. Exit polls show a plurality of Virginians went to the polls to send a message to Mr Trump. Their top issue was healthcare. At least in Virginia, the president's dismal approval ratings translated into ballot-box poison. The stage is now set for the midterm elections in 2018. Republicans will have a year to brace for what could be an anti-Trump tsunami forming on the horizon. What they - and Mr Trump - do next could decide their fate.

"The company took offence to a piece the newspaper wrote about its park in Anaheim, California The Walt Disney company has ended its ban of the Los Angeles Times newspaper after a backlash from US media.

High-profile organisations and individuals publicly criticised the company's decision. The New York Times and Washington Post vowed to boycott Disney screenings in solidarity with the banned newspaper.

"Two women wrapped in thermal blankets stand near the Manchester Arena after the attack A breakdown in communication led to a near two-hour delay in sending fire crews to the scene of the Manchester Arena attack, the BBC understands. They were deployed to the Ariana Grande gig on 22 May one hour 47 minutes after Salman Abedi killed 22 and injured 512. A report leaked to theManchester Evening News,externalclaims the fire service waited until it knew there was no further terror threat. Greater Manchester fire service said it will not be commenting on the leak. The leaked report is an internal investigation by the Fire Brigades Union and Greater Manchester fire service for Lord Kerslake's inquiry examining how the emergency services responded to the attack. The BBC understands the document includes: County Fire Officer Pete O'Reilly was not informed the bomb had gone off for 35 minutes Fire brigade bosses followed protocol by not deploying crews due to the potential risk of a second terrorist incident The brigade claims it did not know until nearly two hours after the attack that the threat had been lifted Only three paramedics ever entered the cordoned-off foyer area at the centre of the blast, the BBC has been told A firefighter who was on duty on the night has told the BBC they wanted to help but senior management from the fire service did not send them to the scene. ""I don't want people - the public - to think that we didn't want to go or we were scared to go. We were held back by the senior management,"" the firefighter, who wants to remain anonymous, said. The fire service said it would not comment on the findings until Lord Kerslake had delivered his official inquiry. It earlier said it had conducted a ""debrief"" of its response, but it would be inappropriate to comment furthergiven the fact it was co-operating with an ongoing review by Lord Kerslake into the Manchester attack, commissioned by Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham. This video can not be played Emergency services outside the Manchester Arena after this year's bomb attack. Eight days after the bombing, Greater Manchester Police Chief Constable Ian Hopkins said the fire and ambulance services initially went to a rendezvous point as per standard practice. He said his force had been on the scene ""within seconds"" and had contacted North West Ambulance Service within three minutes of the incident being declared. Many of the most seriously injured victims did not get expert medical help for more than an hour,witnesses have said. Only three paramedics ever entered the cordoned-off foyer area at the centre of the blast, the BBC has been told. Kirk Cornwall said a training exercise in 2016 highlighted similar issues There was also a delay with the response during acounter-terrorism training exercise at the Trafford Centre12 months before the Arena bomb, according to a retired former senior member of the Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service. Kirk Cornwall, who was an official assessor at the exercise, said: ""I ran an exercise at the Trafford Centre. ""I was there as one of the observers/assessors, and a similar thing occurred there where the pre-organised exercise started at midnight and it was around about 02:00 to 02:30 before emergency services personnel laid hands on a casualty purely through a breakdown in communication.

"Passengers queue to get on to a Greater Anglia service train Five rail operators have experienced disruption due to strike action by the Rail, Maritime and Transport union. Workers on Southern, Greater Anglia and South Western Railway are striking for 48 hours, while staff on Merseyrail and Northern walked out for 24 hours. The union is in dispute over driver-only operated (DOO) trains, also known as driver-controlled operated (DCO). Aslef, which has also been in dispute with Southern,announced on Wednesday that train drivers had accepted a deal. It means there will be a second safety-trained person on every DOO train, except in exceptional circumstances, gives drivers a five-year pay deal worth 28.5%, and confirms the terms and conditions under which members are employed. The executive committee of the train drivers' union had recommended its members accept the deal, which has no impact on the RMT's continuing industrial action. The RMT described Aslef's deal with Southern as ""shoddy"". Commuters ride a crowded South Western Railway train on the Portsmouth to London line Members of the RMT union, who are mostly conductors, have held a series of strikes on Southern since April 2016 amid concerns over safety and job losses. Changes were introduced on Southern in January making conductors ""on-board supervisors"" and passing responsibility for closing doors to drivers. Industrial action by RMT members has only recently spread to other routes across England. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Southern had said services on most of its routes would operate normally during the 48-hour strike although there would besome alterations,external. However, signalling problems exacerbated changes and led to delays and cancellations during people's commute on Wednesday morning. There were also delays due to trespassers on the line between East Croyden and Clapham and lines between Worthing and Bright were blocked during the evening after a person was hit by a train.

A spokeswoman said only ""a handful"" of services had been disrupted due to the strike. South Western Railway (SWR), which only took over the franchise from South West Trains in August, cancelled about 40% of its services. It published acontingency timetable,externalincluding replacement buses on some routes. However, the RMT has voiced its concerns about the various plans. General Secretary Mick Cash said: ""The only way that Greater Anglia can be running these services is through taking serious risks with public safety just as they did during the last phase of strike action. ""Rail companies are training up rail staff who have previously had no rail operational experience to stand in as highly trained guards. ""In some cases staff are being bussed in by other train companies not involved in the dispute, paid a bounty and put up overnight in hotels."" The RMT union is in dispute over driver-only operated trains, also known as driver-controlled operated trains But Richard Dean, Greater Anglia's train service delivery director, stressed that the ORR was satisfied with its arrangements, and that an independent rail safety expert had  concluded that its stand-in conductor training was ""industry best practice"". ""We will never compromise the safety of our customers,"" Mr Dean added. Merseyrail ran areduced train service,externalacross its network during the 24-hour strike, while Northern ran its lessened service, mostly between 07:00 and 19:00 GMT. A spokesman for the Department for Transport said: ""This dispute is not about jobs or safety - employees have been guaranteed jobs and salaries. In fact at Southern Rail, where these changes have already been introduced, there are now more staff on trains. ""The independent rail regulator has said driver-controlled trains, which have been used in this country for more than 30 years, are safe."" Has your journey been affected by the dispute?

"Snapchat owner Snap says it is working to overhaul its signature messaging app, as it struggles to attract users and turn a profit. Shares in the firm plunged after hours on Tuesday, after the firm reported losses of more than $400m (Â£337m) in the quarter. It also had lower-than-expected revenue and user growth. Snapchat said the changes would make the app easier to use and more compatible with Android phones. However, it warned the transition could be rocky. ""We're willing to take that risk for what we believe are substantial long-term benefits to our business,"" said 27-year-old chief executive Evan Spiegel. Snapchat pioneered the craze for disappearing messages among teens. Analysis - By Dave Lee, BBC North America technology reporter, San Francisco When you have to put out a statement denying rumours you're shutting down within a yearâ¦ that's when you know things aren't going particularly well. As well as denying it was going bust, in the past few months Snap has had to admit supplies of its Spectacles product, once the talk of the town, are piled high in warehouses. Revenues have been harder to come by than investors had hoped as the company struggles to turn around intense advertisers' interest - these are teenagers, after all - into a system that runs seamlessly and reliable ways to measure success. And just this week the network suffered a widespread outage. Some of Snap's problems are self-inflicted, others are inflicted by Facebook - a company that once tried to buy Snapchat, and which now relentlessly copies its best features. But it faces fierce competition from larger rival Facebook and Facebook's image-sharing network Instagram, which have introduced similar features. Snap said it had 178 million daily active users on average over the quarter, up 3% over the previous three months. Snapchat founder Evan Spiegel, pictured left with his wife, model Miranda Kerr, became the youngest billionaire in the world two years ago The firm told investors it made almost $208m in revenue in the quarter, up 62% year-on-year. That represents about $1.17 in revenue per user, compared to Facebook's more than $5 in revenue per user. But Snapchat's ad prices have fallen. The firm also reported a nearly $40m loss stemming from excess inventory of its Spectacles product, sunglasses with recording capabilities, which proved less popular than hoped. ""We're learning from it and plan on avoiding a similar mistake in the future,"" Mr Spiegel said. Snapchat shares plunged more than 17% in after-hours trade, falling below $13. That extended the losses that started soon after Snapchat became a publicly traded company in March, when shares debuted at $17. The earnings report came less than a day after an outage on the service.Snapchat also had to address rumours,externalit was shutting down.

"Ralph Northam (L) and Ed Gillespie Democrats have scored two significant victories in the US - in the first statewide elections since President Donald Trump came to power in January. In Virginia, Ralph Northam defeated Republican Ed Gillespie in a governorship race marked by tussles on immigration and Confederate statues. Phil Murphy, who beat Kim Guadagno, will be New Jersey governor. The results could give an early indication of how next year's midterm congressional elections will turn out. New York City's Democrat mayor was also comfortably re-elected. Meanwhile, Virginia voters also made history by electing their first openly transgender state legislator. Virginia elects first transgender lawmaker Diverse politicians chosen across the US Democrats have been craving something to celebrate after defeat in four congressional special elections this year, despite a groundswell of grassroots opposition to President Trump. With nearly all the votes countered in Virginia, Mr Northam had 53.9% against 44.9% for Mr Gillespie. Mr Northam, the lieutenant governor of Virginia, will now replace popular Governor Terry McAuliffe, a Democrat. Mr Northam won despite a series of flip-flops during the campaign. Progressive supporters were outraged after Mr Northam reversed stance to say he would oppose any attempt by a Virginia city to provide sanctuary to illegal immigrants. Pain of defeat still lingers for Democrats The Democrat offered to work with President Trump after previously calling him ""a narcissistic maniac"". Mr Northam also vowed to lead efforts to remove Confederate statues, only to say later that he would leave the decision to local authorities. And his camp was further embarrassed by a racially charged advert, released by a group supporting his candidacy. Mr Gillespie, a Washington lobbyist and former Republican party chairman, had accused Mr Northam of failing to curb gang violence and seeking to tear down statues honouring Civil War, pro-slavery secessionists. This video can not be played Virginia election: Ed Gillespie running on Trumpism without Trump Mr Gillespie's style was combative - but he distanced himself from President Trump. Responding to the election result, Mr Trump tweeted that Mr Gillespie ""did not embrace me or what I stand for"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Meanwhile,Virginia voters elected their first openly transgender state legislator in Danica Roem. The 32-year-old journalist and stepmother ousted a long-time, pro-Trump, incumbent Republican in a race that focused on traffic issues. Her rival, Bob Marshall, described himself earlier this year as Virginia's ""chief homophobe"". Virginia voters also made history by electing their first transgender candidate In New Jersey, Mr Murphy was comfortably leading the race with 55.5%. His Republican rival Ms Guadagno has 42.6%, with about 90% of the votes counted. Mr Murphy will replace Republican Chris Christie, who was in office for eight years. Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington Democrats finally have a victory of the non-moral kind. After coming up short in a handful of special elections across the US, they went to the polls in a battleground state and posted a huge win. How the Democrats, from governor candidate Ralph Northam on down, swept through election night in Virginia should be particularly concerning to Republicans across the US. Turnout from Democratic supporters surged. They ran up huge margins with college-educated voters and residents in the wealthy Northern Virginia suburbs. The legions of rural voters who turned out for Donald Trump in 2016 were a non-factor. Democrats won legislative races that were considered to be in play only in the rosiest of Democratic wave scenarios. Exit polls show a plurality of Virginians went to the polls to send a message to Mr Trump. Their top issue was healthcare. At least in Virginia, the president's dismal approval ratings translated into ballot-box poison. The stage is now set for the midterm elections in 2018. Republicans will have a year to brace for what could be an anti-Trump tsunami forming on the horizon. What they - and Mr Trump - do next could decide their fate.

"This video can not be played Paradise Papers: Prince Charlesâ offshore investments revealed Prince Charles campaigned to alter climate-change agreements without disclosing his private estate had an offshore financial interest in what he was promoting, BBC Panorama has found. TheParadise Papersshow the Duchy of Cornwall in 2007 secretly bought shares worth $113,500 in a Bermuda company that would benefit from a rule change. The prince was a friend of a director of Sustainable Forestry Management Ltd. The Duchy of Cornwall says he has no direct involvement in its investments. A Clarence House spokesman said the Prince of Wales had ""certainly never chosen to speak out on a topic simply because of a company that it [the Duchy of Cornwall] may have invested in"". He added: ""In the case of climate change his views are well-known, indeed he has been warning of the threat of global warming to our environment for over 30 years. ""Carbon markets are just one example that the prince has championed since the 1990s and which he continues to promote today."" He added Prince Charles was ""free to offer thoughts and suggestions on a wide range of topics"" and ""cares deeply"" about the issue of climate change but ""it is for others to decide whether to take the advice"". Sir Alistair Graham, former chairman of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, said Prince Charles's actions amounted to a serious conflict of interest. He said: ""There's a conflict of interest between his own investments of the Duchy of Cornwall and what he's trying to achieve publicly. ""And I think it's unfortunate that somebody of his importance, of his influence, becomes involved in such a serious conflict."" Tycoon made $41m from âpeopleâs fundâ Paradise Papers: All you need to know Owner avoided taxes on shopping centre The leaked documents held by law firm Appleby show the Duchy of Cornwall also made offshore investments totalling $3.9m in four funds in the Cayman Islands in 2007. This is legal and there is no suggestion of tax avoidance. A Duchy of Cornwall spokesman said Prince Charles voluntarily pays income tax on any revenue from his estate. He added the estate's investments ""do not derive any tax advantage whatsoever based on their location or any other aspect of their structure and there is no loss of revenue to HMRC as a result"". The prince began campaigning for changes to two important environmental agreements weeks after Sustainable Forestry Management (SFM) sent his office lobbying documents. Prince Charles's estate almost tripled its money in just over a year although it is not clear what caused the rise in the share value. Despite his high profile campaign, the environmental agreements were not changed. The documents reveal theDuchy of Cornwall, an Â£896m private estate that provides Prince Charles with an income,externaland which he is said to be ""actively involved"" in running, bought the shares in February 2007.  At the time $113,500 was worth about Â£58,000. One of SFM's directors was the late Hugh van Cutsem, a millionaire banker and conservationist who has been described as the one of the Prince's closest friends. The minutes of a company board meeting that approved the Duchy's shareholding say: ""The Chairman thanked Mr van Cutsem for his introduction of the Duchy of Cornwall and the Board unanimously agreed that the subscription by the Duchy of Cornwall be kept confidential except in respect of any disclosure required by law."" The island that swapped donkey rides for offshore cash Paradise Papers revelations around the world Apple's secret tax bolthole revealed SFM traded in carbon credits, a market created by international treaties to tackle global warming. It wanted to trade in credits from ""tropical and subtropical forests"" but was hampered by two important climate change agreements, the EU's Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) and the Kyoto Protocol, which largely excluded carbon credits from rainforests. When the Duchy bought its shares, SFM was lobbying for a ""change in policy"" on carbon credits, the documents show. It had hired the US former lead negotiator on the Kyoto Protocol, Stuart Eizenstat ""to lobby for inclusion of forest carbon credits"" in new US and EU laws and regulations. Board minutes from February 2007 show SFM was also taking ""steps to influence events to support forest credits"" ahead of Kyoto Protocol meetings at the end of the year. On 6 June 2007, four months after the Duchy bought its shares, Mr van Cutsem asked SFM's chairman to send lobbying documents to the office of the prince. Under the heading ""public policy and advocacy"", minutes of a board meeting held in Paris say ""the chairman referred the committee to the bundle of materials which had been prepared by the company for various policymakers... Mr van Cutsem... asked that a set of documents be prepared for the Prince of Wales office. The chairman undertook to do so"". Four weeks later, on 2 July,Prince Charles, made a speech that criticised the EU ETS and Kyoto Protocol,externalfor excluding carbon credits from rainforests, and called for change. Speaking at the Business in the Community Awards Dinner, the prince said: ""As the Kyoto protocol now stands tropical rainforest nations have no way of earning credits from their standing forests other than by cutting them down and planting new ones,"" he said. ""The European Carbon Trading Scheme excludes carbon credits for forests from developing nations. This has got be wrong and we must urge the international community to work together to redress these failings urgently."" The campaigning was taking place ahead of meetings about the Kyoto Protocol In October 2007, he launched thePrince's Rainforests Project,external, which aimed to ""increase global recognition of the contribution of tropical deforestation to climate change and to find ways to make the rainforests worth more alive than dead."" In aspeech to mark the launch,external, he said: ""The Kyoto Protocol does not have a mechanism to protect standing rainforests. ""Credits are available for afforestation and reforestation projects, but not for maintaining an old growth forest. And the European Trading Scheme excludes carbon credits for forestry in developing nations altogetherâ¦ surely we have to accept that the pressing urgency of climate change requires a response that embraces rather than excludes primary tropical forests?"" Panorama has been unable to find evidence of any speeches the prince made before 2008 about changing Kyoto and EU ETS to include carbon credits for rainforests. The programme asked the prince's office for any such speeches but they did not respond. Over the next six months, the future king made further speeches and videos about rainforests. In avideo released in January 2008,external, the prince said: ""The immediate priority, I believe, is the need to develop a new credit market which will give a true value to carbon and the ecosystem services the rainforests provide the rest of the world."" Lewis Hamilton 'dodged' VAT on private jet Mrs Brown's Boys stars 'put Â£2m offshore' Bono linked to tax probe in Lithuania In February 2008, he reportedly discussed rainforests at a private meeting with the then Prime Minister Gordon Brown. Days later, he met with the then President of the European Commission, Jose Manuel Barroso, and the EU's environment, energy, trade and agriculture commissioners. In aspeech to 150 MEPs,external, he said: ""I have great hopes that the next version of the European Emissions Trading scheme might extend the helping and very visible hand of a market approach to assist in keeping the rainforests standingâ¦ the lives of billions of people depend on your response and none of us will be forgiven by our children and grandchildren if we falter and fail."" On 18 June 2008, as the global financial crash was beginning, the Duchy sold its stake in SFM. The documents show it was paid $325,000 for the 50 shares. SFM is no longer in existence. This video can not be played Sir Alistair Graham says Prince Charles should be accountable to public scrutiny The Duchy was established in 1337 and uses the income to fund the public, private and charitable activities of the Prince of Wales and his children. Its accounts are independently audited and put before Parliament.

"This video can not be played Trump to N Korea: 'Your weapons are not making you safer' US President Donald Trump has issued a blunt warning to North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un in an address to South Korea's parliament. ""Do not underestimate us. Do not try us,"" he said, while also condemning the ""dark fantasy"" of life in the North. He addressed Mr Kim saying ""the weapons you are acquiring are not making you safer"", and urged other nations to join forces to stop Pyongyang. The US leader is now in China as part of a five-nation tour of Asia. He will meet Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping for talks likely to focus on trade and North Korea. Pyongyang's nuclear ambitions have been high on Mr Trump's agenda throughout this trip. Over the past year North Korea has carried out missile tests in defiance of UN sanctions and in September conducted its sixth and biggest nuclear test. Trump vows to tackle N Korea on Asia trip N Korea: Where is the war of words heading? North Korea crisis explained in 300 words Mr Trump's words to South Korean lawmakers were being closely watched and while his rhetoric was stark, he did not repeat his previous bombast towards the North. These are the most striking points from his speech: In an unexpected move, Mr Trump chose to directly address North Korea's leader in his speech, urging him to discard his nuclear programme and weapons. ""They are putting your regime in grave danger,"" warned Mr Trump. ""Every step you take down this dark path increases the peril you face."" This video can not be played How could war with North Korea unfold? He also made reference to North Korea's founder and Mr Kim's grandfather, Kim Il-sung, in words likely to inflame Pyongyang. ""North Korea is not the paradise your grandfather envisioned.  It is a hell that no person deserves."" But Mr Trump also appeared toreiterate Tuesday's offerto reach a deal, saying that ""despite every crime you've committed... we will offer you a path for a better future"". He said that to interpret past US restraint as weakness ""would be a fatal miscalculation"", as there was now a different US administration in place. ""Today, I hope I speak not only for our countries but for all civilised nations, when I say to the North: 'Do not underestimate us. Do not try us'."" This video can not be played South Korean villagers voice anger over THAAD He pointed to the heavy US military presence in the Korean peninsula including aircraft carriers and fighter jets, saying: ""I want peace through strength."" But he also made sure to single out North Korea's biggest economic supporter, China, as well as Russia, calling on them to sever all ties including economic ones. After the ""rocket man"" and ""fire and fury"", nobody knew quite what to expect from Donald Trump today. In the end, those in the administration urging him to tone down his rhetoric carried sway. The speech was a warning but not a rush to war. He pushed China and Russia to up their pressure on North Korea. The horror stories of daily life in the North were effective, particularly when compared to liberal South Korea. And the olive branch to Kim Jong-un was the most concrete offer Mr Trump has made yet to the regime. The problem is: there's virtually no chance that the condition for talks - denuclearisation - will be accepted. Having seen what happened to the leaders of Libya and Iraq, North Korea feels only nuclear weapons will guarantee regime survival. The hermit state will have blocked its population from listening to Mr Trump. Optimists now say at least there's been no weapons test since September. But the fact that's seen as progress shows how low the bar now is. Mr Trump spent a significant portion of his speech paying tribute to the achievements of the South since the Korean War, which cemented the division of North and South Korea. After his speech, Mr Trump and his wife visited Seoul's National Cemetery which honours the war dead He contrasted this with the ""horror of life"" in North Korea and said their separate trajectories were ""a tragic experiment in the laboratory of history"". ""The more successful South Korea becomes, the more decisively you discredit the dark fantasy at the heart of the Kim regime,"" he told lawmakers. While listing South Korea's achievements, Mr Trump also spent considerable time noting its prowess in the golfing world, saying its players are ""some of the best on Earth"". Mr Trump, an avid fan of the sport, played in Japan earlier in his Asian tour. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Appleby decided against a shelf company to be owned by Isabel dos Santos, the daughter of Angola's ex-president Appleby is the main source of the leaked Paradise Papers documents and, like all providers of offshore financial services, has to check certain things with its prospective clients in order to prevent money laundering, corruption and other illegal activity. This process is called ""due diligence"". Different countries have different requirements, but most expect the service provider to know who its client is, where the client's money has come from and the purpose of the company it is setting up. Among the applications, there are often some questionable individuals and companies trying to set up shell companies. Then there are the PEPs, or politically exposed persons. They may or may not have genuine applications but the risk they would bring has to be fully vetted. The lawyers at the heart of the leaks The examples below reflect decisions made at the time; it is unclear whether further requests were made. Some are shown in their original document format: 15 Feb 2012:Proposed shareholders/directors of funds, both principals produced passport copies issued by the ""World Government of World citizens"". This was deemed to be outside of ACSL's (Appleby Corporate Services Limited) risk parameters and these potential clients were therefore declined. 23 Apr 2012:Potential client wishes to acquire a ""shelf"" company in Mauritius or BVI (British Virgin Islands). The shelf company would be owned by Isabel JosÃ© dos Santos, who is the daughter of the then Angolan President, JosÃ© Eduardo dos Santos.  The company was to be used for investment purposes. ACSL does not provide shelf companies to clients. Furthermore World-Check searches indicate both Isabel and JosÃ© are PEPS. Other internet searches revealed adverse findings for both Isabel JosÃ© dos Santos and JosÃ© Eduardo dos Santos. 29 May 2013:Potential client wishes to set up BVI company. Details of the proposed transaction regarding citizenship and residence and activities of company is risky. Client may want to use precision guided bombs to communicate. 20 Jun 2013:Proposed engagement presented as very high risk. The High Risk Committee declined to take on the business due in part to the clients' ties to the Rwandan military thus would be PEPs and Rwanda may be on various sanctions lists, and bribery and corruption are of concern. The company proposed business will be conducted in a non-recognized jurisdiction. 20 Jan 2014:Proposed engagement presented as high risk as the proposed business dealings are concentrated in the Middle East and Iran. Iran remains the subject of several sanctions and we could not mitigate against bribery and corruption risks and the payments to escrow could be illicit. 10 Mar 2014:Potential engagement requested our service to incorporate a company which will be a holding company providing instant exchange between Bitcoin* and Kenyan Shillings for their investors. (virtual currency related business). *NOTE: The reasons for this decline are not known, but other documents show internal discussions within Appleby about the risk of Bitcoin being used to fund terrorism or the drug trade.

"The huge growth of the offshore finance industry, highlighted by theParadise Papers leak, was the unforeseen result of an ""accounting device"" created by Britain, writes the BBC's Andy Verity. Here's the received wisdom: when the British Empire faded in size and significance after World War Two, a few scattered islands around the globe wanted to keep their imperial ties to London. The British government had to find a way to reduce the economic dependence of the likes of Bermuda, Montserrat or the British Virgin Islands, so it awarded them special tax-exempt status, creating the conditions for a thriving financial services industry. Yes, tax evasion and money laundering may have got a little out of hand from time to time, but overall it succeeded in lifting them out of dependence on the UK government. Tycoon made $41m from âpeopleâs fundâ Charles lobbied on climate policy after shares buy Paradise Papers: All you need to know But there's a deeper story. It wasn't by design that the remnants of a dying British Empire morphed into a world leader in offshore financial services, selling secrecy and tax avoidance to multi-nationals and the wealthiest individuals in the world. Instead, the crucial moment was more of an accident - which gave rise to advantages no-one had foreseen. And it began not in Bermuda or Jersey but in another offshore centre - ""offshore"" not to the UK, but to the US - the City of London. When the 20th Century began, income tax was in single digits and progressive taxation - charging richer people a higher rate - had barely begun. In the run-up to World War One, chancellors of the exchequer - from Asquith to Lloyd George - began raising taxes to pay for social reforms, such as the old age pension. As the war progressed, the state demanded more and more income tax from every citizen and higher rates for the wealthy, leading to a top rate of 30% by 1919. Accountants to wealthy individuals began to devise ways to avoid tax. Clients could become resident in Jersey, where tax rates were far lighter. Or, if they wanted to stay in London, they might put their money in a trust registered elsewhere, perhaps on the Isle of Man, where in theory it was no longer theirs - and therefore not visible to the prying eyes of an Inland Revenue inspector. David Lloyd George served as Chancellor in Herbert Henry Asquith's government, before rising to PM in 1916 But it was in the dying days of the Empire that the offshore financial services industry truly boomed. Defined by purpose rather than geography, ""offshore"" means any jurisdiction that seeks to attract investors on the basis of light taxes and looser regulations. On that basis, the epicentre of the offshore industry is not Nassau in the Bahamas or George Town in the Cayman Islands. As author Nick Shaxson points out in his fascinating offshore expose, Treasure Islands: ""The modern offshore system did not start its explosive growth on scandal-tainted and palm-fringed islands in the Caribbean, or in the Alpine foothills of Zurich. It all began in London, as Britain's formal Empire gave way to something more subtle."" In 1957, Britain and its imperial remains were trying to recover from a financial crisis.  The previous year the UK had joined forces with France and Israel to try to recapture the Suez Canal after it was nationalised by the defiant anti-colonial Egyptian President, Gamal Abdel Nasser. Viewing the invasion as European imperialism at its worst, the US refused any assistance. By the end of 1956, a run on the pound was under way. The Bank of England wanted to curb the outflow of pounds by boosting interest rates sharply, but Her Majesty's Treasury had other ideas. Since the Bretton Woods economic conference of 1944 towards the end of World War Two, countries had agreed to control movements of capital to curb the speculative flows into and out of countries that had worsened the economic crises of the past. If, say, Tate & Lyle wanted to invest several million pounds in a new sugar production facility in Jamaica, it would need signed approval from Her Majesty's Treasury. Normally this was a formality. But during the Suez crisis, the Treasury announced that, on a temporary basis, it would no longer approve foreign capital investments. The Bank of England did not get its way against the Treasury The City's merchant banks were alarmed. Arranging finance for projects in the former colonies was their lifeblood. How would they avoid ruin? Digging through the archives, financial academic Gary Burn unearthed what happened next. Hearing the banks' complaints in a series of meetings, the Bank of England agreed in late 1957 to allow the commercial banks to continue to lend and borrow to foreign clients on two conditions: the lending had to be in a currency other than sterling, and both sides of the transaction - the lender and the borrower - had to reside somewhere other than the UK ""The decision was momentous in all respects,"" says one of the leading experts in offshore finance, Prof Ronen Palan of City, University of London. ""They simply deemed certain transactions as not taking place in the UK. Where did the transactions take place for regulatory purposes? Nowhere. ""I think it wasn't at all by design; it was a mistake. They didn't understand the implications. It was seen as an accounting device."" The so-called ""Eurodollar"" was born - a global offshore financial market, transacting in dollars and allowing unlimited sums to be borrowed and lent, but under the control of no single state.  No act of Parliament (or Congress) sanctioned the decision. There was no thoughtful policy-making, no careful debate. The Treasury was at first left in the dark. But within years the implications were obvious - this could revive the City of London's fortunes. ""By the time the Treasury figured it out, they thought, 'this is good business for the City',"" said Prof Palan. Banks from all around the world could borrow and lend in dollars without being subject to US tax or banking regulations - making banking in dollars more profitable out of London than out of Wall Street. Offshore banks didn't have to hold money in reserve for every dollar they lent (as they would in the US), which would dramatically cut their costs. While transactions were arranged in London, the lenders and borrowers could be registered anywhere. But the parties to Eurodollar transactions needed addresses. So, zero-tax jurisdictions from the Cayman Islands to the Montserrat were used by London's investment banks as the official tax residences of their wealthy customers. Clients could avoid both tax and undesirable scrutiny - for example from the US tax authorities. In the British Overseas Territories, local laws were passed to attract more registration business, collecting modest fees that mounted up. No need for a bank branch out there - just a drawer in an offshore lawyer's filing cabinet. The City of London began its recovery to become the centre of finance it is today Howls of protest from the US government were ignored. Between 1960 and 1970, the size of the Eurodollar market went from $1bn to $46bn. In the 1970s, countries rich in petrodollars from soaring oil prices were faced with a dilemma: repatriate the money to New York - where they would be taxed on it - or keep it offshore. By 1980, the so-called Eurodollar market was worth more than half a trillion. After the deregulation of the City of London in the 1986 ""Big Bang"", US banks joined in, setting up in London. And as the 1990s and 2000s progressed, it became the undisputed global centre for foreign currency trading. Banks' wealthy individual and corporate clients didn't incorporate in the Cayman Islands or the British Virgin Islands because they liked the weather there - many never visited. Offshore centres were attractive to businesses looking to reduce their tax bill, but sometimes, more importantly, to avoid what they regarded as excessive regulation. Cayman Islands-registered companies were used heavily, for example, by the energy giant Enron as it built its business model based on fraudulent accounts. Tax-free, light regulation jurisdictions, including the Bahamas, the Cayman Islands and Delaware in the US, became the corporate locations of choice for legitimate hedge funds. They were also used to incorporate the vehicles at the heart of the global financial crisis - the 'structured investment vehicles' that did not show up on bank's balance sheets and bought billions of mortgage-backed securities, massively increasing the unnoticed risks in the global financial system which led to the crisis of 2008. Likewise, the British Virgin Islands has been used by many legitimate businesses. It has also become the favourite secrecy jurisdiction for clients of the Panama-based law firm exposed in last year's Panama Papers revelations, Mossack Fonseca.

"Priti Patel has left No 10 via the back door after talks with the PM to find out if she will be sacked amid controversy over meetings with Israeli ministers. The international development secretary was ordered by the PM to cut short an African trip to fly back to the UK. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said a source told her that Ms Patel would rather resign than be sacked. Ms Patel apologised about meetings with Israeli politicians in August. But there are now questions about further meetings held in September. Ms Patel arrived via the back door of Number 10 for her meeting with the prime minister after flying back to London Heathrow from Uganda. The BBC's diplomatic correspondent James Landale said that by holding the secret meetings with Israeli officials, Ms Patel had broken ""one of the cardinal principles of government, namely collective responsibility, the idea that government speaks and acts as one once a policy has been agreed"". He said this was about practicalities - so part of Whitehall knows what the other part is doing - and it also ensures ministers remain accountable. Priti Patel, top right, got into a ministerial car after arriving at Heathrow Ms Patel was formally reprimanded in Downing Street on Monday, where she was asked to give details about a dozen meetings she had with Israeli officials while on holiday, which were not sanctioned by the Foreign Office. It has also now emerged that Ms Patel conducted two further meetings in September without government officials present. Rolling updates: Priti Patel under pressure Patel apologises for Israeli meetings Patel held undisclosed meetings in Israel It is thought Lord Polak, honorary president of the Conservative Friends of Israel, was present at both meetings. Ms Patel met Israeli public security minister Gilad Erdan in Westminster on 7 September. He later tweeted about their meeting. Allow Twitter content?

On 18 September she met foreign ministry official Yuval Rotem in New York. It is not yet clear whether Ms Patel had informed the prime minister about these meetings or of her plans to look into giving tax-payers' money to the Israeli military to treat wounded Syrian refugees in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights region - a request that was turned down as ""inappropriate"" by officials. In a further development on Wednesday the Israeli Haaretz newspaper reported that during August she visited an Israeli military field hospital in the Golan Heights - the UK, like other members of the international community, has never recognised Israeli control of the area seized from Syria in the 1967 Six-Day War. There was no immediate comment from the Department for International Development on the report. Ms Patel wasforced to correct the record earlier this week,externalabout the number of meetings that she had attended and when the Foreign Office had been notified about them. The MP said she had been wrong to suggest to the Guardian that Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson knew of the trip in advance when he had only learnt about it while it was under way. Elected as Conservative MP for Witham in May 2010 Served as a Treasury minister from July 2014 to May 2015 She then became employment minister from May 2015 to July 2016 Appointed International Development Secretary in July 2016 A longstanding Eurosceptic, she was a leading figure in the Vote Leave campaign during the EU referendum Read more: A profile of Priti Patel Ms Patel, who has been an MP since 2010, is a long-standing supporter of Israel and a former vice-chairman of Conservative Friends of Israel. Former Labour lord chancellor Lord Falconer told BBC Radio 4's Today: ""She should not be colluding with a foreign government - it doesn't matter if it's an ally or not... to do it in that secretive way makes her look like she's much more the emissary of the Israeli government than a member of the British government."" Former Conservative international development minister Sir Desmond Swayne said that even if Ms Patel was forced to quit, just a week afterDefence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon resignedfor inappropriate behaviour, it would not be a ""catastrophe"". ""There are 22 Cabinet ministers and there are plenty of people who are talented to step into their shoes,"" he told BBC's Victoria Derbyshire. ""It will not be a huge destabilisation."" This video can not be played Conservative Crispin Blunt tells Today it would have been alright if Patel had told Foreign Office about meetings In a letter to Mrs May, Labour's shadow Cabinet Office minister Jon Trickett called on the prime minister to either call in her independent adviser on ministerial standards to investigate, or ""state publicly and explain your full reasons for why Priti Patel retains your confidence"". However, Conservative MP Nadhim Zahawi - a member of the parliamentary foreign affairs committee - told BBC Two's Newsnight that he believed some of the criticism facing Ms Patel was down to the fact she was a pro-Brexit campaigner during the EU referendum. He said Ms Patel was not having ""clandestine"" meetings with ""an enemy state"" and that the Foreign Office was made aware of the meetings while she was in Israel.

"This video can not be played Paradise Papers: How to hide your cash offshore TheParadise Papersare a huge leak of financial documents that throw light on the top end of the world of offshore finance. A number of stories are appearing in a week-long expose of how politicians, multinationals, celebrities and high-net-worth individuals use complex structures to protect their cash from higher taxes. As with last year's Panama Papers leak, the documents were obtained by the German newspaperSÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung,external, which called in theInternational Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ),externalto oversee the investigation.BBC Panoramaand theGuardian,externalare among the nearly 100 media groups investigating the papers. The Paradise Papers name was chosen because of the idyllic profiles of many of the offshore jurisdictions whose workings are unveiled, including Bermuda, the HQ of the main company involved,Appleby. It also dovetails nicely with the French term for a tax haven - paradis fiscal. Then again, the Isle of Man plays a big part. The offshore financial affairs of hundreds of politicians, multinationals, celebrities and high-net-worth individuals, some of them household names, have been revealed. The papers also throw light on the legal firms, financial institutions and accountants working in the sector and on the jurisdictions that adopt offshore tax rules to attract money. These are the stories so far: Prince Charles campaigned to alter climate-change agreementswithout disclosing his private estate had an offshore financial interest in what he was promoting Apple has protected its low-tax regimeby using the Channel Island of Jersey Formula 1 championLewis Hamilton avoided tax on his Â£16.5m luxury jet, the papers suggest The Queen's private estateinvested about Â£10m offshoreincluding a small amount in the company behind BrightHouse, a chain accused of irresponsible lending One of President Donald Trump's top administration officialskept a financial stake in a firm whose major partners include a Russian companypart-owned by President Vladimir Putin's son-in-law An entrepreneur charged with managing the oil wealth of the struggling African state of Angolawas paid more than $41m in just 20 months A Lithuanian shopping mallpartly owned by U2 star Bonois under investigation for potential tax evasion How three stars of the hit BBC sitcom, Mrs Brown's Boys,diverted more than Â£2m into an offshore tax-avoidance scheme One of the world's largest firmsloaned a businessman previously accused of corruption $45mand asked him to negotiate mining rights in the DR Congo The Isle of Manpassed a law that would help tax evaders, the documents show A key aide of Canada's PM has beenlinked to offshore schemesthat may have cost the nation millions of dollars in taxes, threatening to embarrass Justin Trudeau Lord Ashcroft, a former Conservative party deputy chairman and a significant donor,may have broken the rules around how his offshore investments were managed.

You can find our stories on the revelationshere,external. If you have a question about the Paradise Papers you can submit ithere. There are more than 1,400GB of data, containing about 13.4 million documents. Some 6.8 million come from the offshore legal service providerAppleby,externaland corporate services provider Estera. The two operated together under the Appleby name until Estera became independent in 2016. Another six million documents come from corporate registries in some 19 jurisdictions, mostly in the Caribbean. A smaller amount comes from the Singapore-based international trust and corporate services provider,Asiaciti Trust,external.  The leaked data covers seven decades, from 1950 to 2016. A law firm that helps corporations, financial institutions and high-net-worth individuals set up and register companies in offshore jurisdictions. Founded in Bermuda and with a history dating back to the 1890s, it has become one of the largest and best known of about 10 major companies involved in the specialist arena. The leak shows the US dominates Appleby's client register, with more than 31,000 US addresses for clients. There were more than 14,000 UK addresses and 12,000 in Bermuda. Who are Appleby? As with 2016'sPanama Papers, German newspaper SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung obtained the original material and was the stepping off point for this investigation. In the case of the Panama Papers, the originator of the leaks, named only as John Doe, issued a manifesto a month after the publication date. A simple statement this time says: ""For their protection, SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung does as a general policy not comment on its sources!"" As with the Panama Papers, theInternational Consortium of Investigative Journalists,external, a global network of investigative journalists, was called in to work on the project. Along with the BBC's flagship Panorama programme, there are nearly 100 media partners involved in 67 countries, including theGuardian,externaland theNew York Times,external. The media partners say the investigation is in the public interest because data leaks from the world of offshore have repeatedly exposed wrongdoing. The leaks have led to hundreds of investigations worldwide, resulting in politicians, ministers and even prime ministers being forced from office. The $64m question, or probably more if you are in a tax haven, or offshore financial centre as the industry  prefers to call it. It is indeed thefifth major leak of financial papers in the past four yearsand, yes, last year's Panama Papers were bigger in size - 2.6TB to 1.4TB - but the scale of the information in the Paradise Papers and how it lifts the lid on sophisticated, upper-end offshore dealings, many linked to the UK, is unprecedented. As Gerard Ryle, who oversees member journalists at the ICIJ, says: ""This leak is important because it's the high end of town. People may have dismissed the Mossack Fonseca leaks as they were rogue players who would take any client. Most of the offshore world is not like that at all. Here you have the gold-plated company."" The documents were tougher than the Panama Papers too. Mr Ryle says: ""They came in different formats and it took us a long time to decipher them. There were nice surprises along the way but it was a much more difficult data set."" It's hard to pin down an exact definition. Tax haven is the term usually used in the media and public, whereas the industry would prefer the term offshore financial centre (OFC). It is essentially a financial jurisdiction outside the regulations of your own nation used by companies and individuals to lower their taxes on profits or assets. They are usually secretive and stable. They are also often small islands, many of them UK Crown Dependencies or Overseas Territories, but not exclusively so. Nations such as Switzerland, Ireland and the Netherlands have similar tax reducing mechanisms, while the UK and the US are leading nations providing services that facilitate the use of OFCs.

"Emma Young lives in Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire and has three children Thousands of people in England who have the most advanced cancers are surviving for several years after diagnosis, according to new research. Macmillan Cancer Support said it was down to new treatments but warned that living longer with advanced cancer can bring its own difficulties. Emma Young, 39, was diagnosed with breast and bone cancer at 35. ""The not-knowing is the hardest, from scan to scan you don't know how it will be,"" she says. ""From the time you have the scan until you get the results is really hard - 'scanziety' is what we call it."" Her diagnosis in May 2014 was delayed after doctors misdiagnosed her symptoms. Days after being told she had breast cancer she was told it had spread to her bones. Stage 4 cancer is where the disease has already spread to at least one other part of the body - which in many cases cannot be cured. Previously, stage 4 cancer patients often had limited options but Macmillan Cancer Support said the new data showed that new and improved treatments mean it can be ""more 'treatable' and manageable, like other chronic illnesses"". But living longer with stage 4 cancer can bring other issues for patients, says Adrienne Betteley, the charity's specialist adviser for end-of-life care. ""This is really positive news, but living with advanced cancer can be a difficult situation to be in. ""As well as dealing with the physical symptoms of cancer, having multiple hospital appointments, scans and treatment options to contend with, there's also the emotional and psychological impact of having an uncertain future.""  Can't find your health trust?Browse the full list Rather search by typing?Back to search If you can't see the NHS Tracker,click or tap here,external. The way Emma chose to cope was by refusing to let doctors give her a prognosis. ""I said I didn't want to know. If you're given one, you count down to that day and what happens when you get to zero? ""I thought I'd carry on regardless without that hanging over me."" Living longer with stage 4 cancer often means juggling hospital appointments and treatments Emma acknowledges such an approach won't suit everyone but for her, not being given a timescale for her illness meant she could ""carry on as usual"" for her three children. ""My youngest is 10 and I want to live as long as possible - I want to keep life normal for them. ""Our life is completely normal - I still do everything with them regardless of my diagnosis. Even though there are times when I could easily sleep in and it's a struggle to get out of bed every day."" It is the first time that data showing the number of people in England living several years after being diagnosed with stage 4 cancer has been available. The figures are based on people in England who were diagnosed with one of 10 common types of cancer between 2012 and 2013, and were still alive at the end of 2015. The data showed 17,000 people with stage 4 cancer had survived for two years or more. Macmillan Cancer Support says the new figures highlight the changing nature of cancer. The charity warns that these patients often face a complex range of issues, including living with uncertainty over how their cancer will progress, and having to make difficult decisions about potentially life-extending treatment and the effect on their quality of life. Emma's cancer is monitored by scans, and bone-strengthening and hormone treatment. She suffers from fatigue and bone pain, struggles to stand for long, and has had to leave her job as a teaching assistant. She receives personal independence payments (PIPs) which were arranged by a nurse at her hospice when she was first diagnosed although they ran out in the summer. ""I had an absolute nightmare with the PIP forms - they took my car away from me - so I had to walk a half-hour walk to school four times a day."" It took four months to sort out and they have now been awarded indefinitely - something Emma believes should be the case for everyone with stage 4 cancer. She has help from cognitive behavioural therapy sessions at her local hospice ""which has been invaluable"" and she credits really good friends for their constant support. ""You can never get away from the fact you've got cancer but you have to shove it to the back of your mind. It's like a demon that will pop up sometimes - you learn to deal with it and put it back in the box. ""You have to ride the waves of emotion - if you want to have a cry you do that.""

"The cuts would affect engineering and parts of London Underground Transport for London (TfL) is cutting 1,400 jobs as part of plans to save Â£5.5bn by 2021, according to unions. The cuts will affect engineering and parts of London Underground (LU), said the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union. It said the figure emerged at a meeting on Tuesday, but TfL said it did not recognise the RMT's number. The RMT criticised the move on the eve of the 30th anniversary of the King's Cross firein which 31 people died. TfL said: ""Over the next few months we will be consulting on further plans in a number of other managerial, support and other non front-line areas across TfL and London Underground (LU). ""None of this will compromise safety, which will always remain our top priority."" A meeting between union leaders and TfL revealed plans to cut spending by 2021 During Mayor Sadiq Khan's election campaign he called Transport for London ""flabby"". He said it could cope with a fares freeze that in effect reduced its income and engineering functions could be merged to save money. Those policies are now coming home to roost and TfL is now having to make efficiencies. The unions say TfL is trying to save Â£5.5bn by 2021. TfL has previously said the figure is Â£4bn. Either way, that is partly the fares freeze, which costs Â£640m, and partly the Government Â£591m operational grant being phased out. Insiders say there has already been considerable belt tightening and trawls for redundancies. Forty-nine managers have left and there have been savings in duplication and agency staff. The big question is will more redundancies affect front-line staff and how Transport for London operates. And how will the Unions react? These policies come with a cost - now we will see if the Mayor was right. RMT general secretary Mick Cash said: ""As part of the Mayor's efforts to slash spending by Â£5.5bn by 2021 we are now being told that the company plans to cut up to 1,400 jobs in engineering in TfL and in some areas of LU. ""RMT demands that no cuts take place, so close to the King's Cross fire anniversary. ""It would be appalling if there was any hacking back on safety. ""The Mayor needs to stand up for TfL and demand restoration of the full capital grant and proper central government funding for the Tube."" TfL said it was ""undertaking the largest ever overhaul of our organisation to provide the most efficient and cost effective transport service for Londoners"". ""We have already reduced management layers and bureaucracy and merged functions in other areas to eliminate duplication and reliance on expensive agency staff"", it said.

"An entrepreneur charged with managing the oil wealth of the struggling African state of Angola was paid more than $41m in just 20 months, leaked documents reveal. The payments were made via a complex web of companies set up in the offshore jurisdiction of Mauritius. Jean-Claude Bastos also used his position to help set up large investment deals he stands to further profit from, theParadise Papersshow. All sides deny any wrongdoing. Like many oil rich countries, Angola set up a sovereign wealth fund to invest the proceeds of its natural resource wealth. Similar schemes have been used by other countries to help ensure a steady income for future generations. Angola is wracked by corruption, suffers extreme poverty and has one of the highest child mortality rates in the world. The fund, Fundo Soberano De Angola (FSDEA), which began with $5bn (Â£3.75bn) in 2011, was mired in controversy from the start, after the then Angolan President Eduardo dos Santos' son, 39-year-old Jose Filomeno, was appointed to head it up. Jean-Claude Bastos, sometimes also known as Jean-Claude Bastos de Morais, a Swiss-Angolan and close friend of the then president's son, was chosen as the fund's asset manager. Typically, a fund of this size would spread the risk of investment among several asset managers, along with the fees it pays, said one expert. Follow all the latest updates Apple's secret tax bolthole revealed Lewis Hamilton 'dodged' VAT on jet Questions over African mining deal However, Mr Bastos was given responsibility for investing almost all of the fund's money, and was paid accordingly. Today, his company Quantum Global Investments Africa Management, manages about 85% of it. One expert described the situation as ""unusual"". Andrew Bauer, an authority on sovereign wealth funds, told the BBC: ""Funds want to hedge the risk. You don't want to put all your eggs in one basket."" In a statement, the FSDEA told the BBC the appointment of Mr Bastos' company to manage the fund followed ""an objective process"". The firm was selected, it said, because of its ""exemplary performance on previous mandates with the Angolan authorities"". The fund also said giving near total control of investments to one asset manager was part of its policy for the first 18 months only. Documents seen by the BBC as part of the Paradise Papers investigation show the fund paid management fees of more than $90m (Â£67.5m) to Mr Bastos' Mauritius-based QG Investments Africa Management. This occurred over a 20-month period between May 2014 and the end of 2015. The leak offers an unprecedented view into what happened to the management fees after being paid into Mr Bastos' company. This money was split into two main chunks - with $41m declared as dividends, or pure profit, and deposited in a company in the British Virgin Islands, itself owned by a series of secretive offshore companies ultimately owned by Mr Bastos. A further $34m was paid in advisory fees to a Swiss firm majority owned by Mr Bastos. The rest, after minor expenses, was retained in the management company run by Mr Bastos. The BBC asked Mr Bastos whether secrecy was the reason for the series of companies registered offshore. He said it was entirely his personal choice how he receives dividends from his companies. He also said the dividends he receives ""pale in comparison to the long term positive impact my projects will have in Angola"". Both the fund and Mr Bastos said the management fees paid to Quantum Global Investments Africa Management are in line with global industry standards. Mr Bastos added that the level of work provided by the group is considerable to ensure projects are built for future success. Within months of receiving the money, a company in which Mr Bastos is a director purchased a 14-seater jet that had been priced at $31.75m. Mr Bastos told the BBC his is one of ""many businesses that own an aircraft to more efficiently manage their travel requirements"" and that travelling on commercial flights is ""unproductive"". The leaked documents also show Mr Bastos holds a personal stake in investments the fund made on his recommendation. In one, tens of millions were committed to a deal with another of Mr Bastos' companies, Afrique Imo Corporation, to build a hotel, office and a retail complex in the Angolan capital, Luanda. The deal represents a ""very strong conflict of interest"" according to Mr Bauer. ""This absolutely should not be happening."" At the time, it sounded alarm bells in the compliance department of Appleby - the law firm that handled the investment, according to internal emails seen by the BBC. In one, sent from a regional compliance manager, a team member charged with making sure the deal was above board noted: ""this poses issues of conflict of interest between the Manager, Fund and the Investee Company"". However, an email from Appleby's director back to the compliance team notes Mr Bastos had ""disclosed his interest"" and, in a board meeting convened to agree the hotel deal, had ""abstained from voting"". Crucially, though, the director notes Mr Bastos ""was still present in the meeting"", before adding: ""For the purpose of managing the conflict, Mr Bastos should refrain from attending any meeting."" On seeing the confidential emails of the exchange, Tom Keatinge, a specialist in financial crime, told the BBC he was ""sure they are going to come to a conclusion that this is not a transaction that they should be approving"". Appleby ""provide[d] the client with the answer that he wanted"", said Mr Keatinge. ""It's hard to believe that just because he abstained from the voting, his views were not well understood by the meeting. So it's a scurrilous approach in my view."" As well as the Luanda complex, two other investments made for the fund in that period carried similar apparent conflicts of interest for Mr Bastos, according to the Appleby documents. Mr Bastos told the BBC that where he holds a stake in investments, he views these investments as ""having aligned interests"" and not being ""conflicted"". The FSDEA said its investment policy for the first 18 months encourages ""close interrelation and synergies... to increase the speed of portfolio development and boost institutional reach"". There are also questions about whether the hotel project represented a good investment for the fund. A former employee of Quantum Global with a direct knowledge of the Luanda deal said in 2016 the project was assessed as ""economically unviable"" because it would not bring good enough returns for the fund. The investment advisers' recommendation was to drop it. Mr Bastos insisted the investment was viable and said that ""by developing what will become Angola's tallest building his group are demonstrating their belief in the long term potential of the Angolan economy"". In Luanda in 2016, rubbish went uncollected after the refuse company was not paid The web of companies run by Mr Bastos would appear to be designed to ""to enrich a particular individual or... group of people"", said Mr Keatinge. ""Whoever has oversight of this structure... the political elite within Angola, there is either massive incompetence or there is complicity here."" Appleby, which is the focus of much of the Paradise Papers investigation, didn't respond to specific questions about Mr Bastos -  citing client confidentiality. The firm which denies any wrongdoing says it ""advises clients on legitimate and lawful ways to conduct their business"". Another document seen by the BBC raises questions for the authorities in Mauritius, after an internal report by another offshore regulator criticised Mr Bastos. The regulator in Jersey notified Mr Bastos that his application to run the asset management business was likely to be refused because it doubted his independence. It highlighted Mr Bastos' ""close association"" with the fund's chairman, Jose Filomeno Dos Santos, and a conviction in Switzerland for ""qualified cases of misappropriation"". Mr Bastos told the BBC he withdrew the application before any formal decision was made by the Jersey regulator. A little more than a month later Mr Bastos applied successfully in Mauritius. He told the BBC he informed the Mauritian authorities about his conviction which in any case had expired and that his ""criminal record is completely clean"". The BBC asked the Financial Services Commission in Mauritius how it satisfied itself Mr Bastos was a fit and proper person to be licensed. It declined to comment on the case but said where there were ""adverse"" issues disclosed in an application, the handling law firm - in this case Appleby - would be responsible for checking. Again, Appleby declined to comment on individual cases. Additional reporting by Christian Bronnimann Listen to more on this story onFile on 4,on Tuesday 7th November at 20:00 GMT on BBC Radio 4.

"Twitter plans to increase the number of characters in tweets from 140 to 280 for the majority of users. The new limit will not apply to tweets written in Japanese, Chinese and Korean which can convey more information in a single character. The move follows a trial among a small group of users which started in September in response to criticism that it was not easy enough to tweet. The change is part of Twitter's plan to attract new users and increase growth. During the test, only 5% of tweets sent were longer than 140 characters and only 2% more than 190, the social media site said ina blog post,external. But those who did use the longer tweets, got more followers, more engagement and spent more time on the site, it added. ""During the first few days of the test, many people tweeted the full 280 limit because it was new and novel, but soon after behaviour normalised,"" wrote Aliza Rosen, Twitter's product manager. ""We saw when people needed to use more than 140 characters, they tweeted more easily and more often. But importantly, people tweeted below 140 most of the time and the brevity of Twitter remained."" According to Twitter, 9% of tweets in English hit the character limits. ""This reflects the challenge of fitting a thought into a tweet, often resulting in lots of time spent editing and even at times abandoning tweets before sending,"" Ms Rosen said. Increasing the character limit should not affect people's experience on the site, she added. ""We - and many of you - were concerned that timelines may fill up with 280-character tweets, and people with the new limit would always use up the whole space. But that didn't happen."" When the change was announced, many criticised it, pointing out changes they would rather see, such as a crackdown on hate crime and bots, and the introduction of a chronological timeline and edit function. The site currently has 330 million active users. This compares with 800 million for Instagram and more than 2 billion users for Facebook.

"Scammers have used WhatsApp to trick people into handing over personal information by tempting them with bogus supermarket vouchers. The messenger app was used to send fake vouchers to people, purporting to be from trusted chains such as Asda, Tesco and Aldi. The messages claimed to offer hundreds of pounds in savings so long as the user followed a link to an online survey asking for personal details. The scam is a form of phishing, where fraudsters pose as reputable organisations to gain personal details. Action Fraud, the UK's national reporting centre for fraud and cyber crime, suggests anyone who has fallen victim to this scamto report it online,externalor call 0300 123 2040.

Fake WhatsApp fools Android users 'We lost Â£300,000 through payment scam' This message was sent to the WhatsApp number used by the public to contact the BBC The scam works by using a link which appears almost identical to a supermarket chain's legitimate website, but with one small difference. For example, in the screenshot above, the d in Aldi is actually a á¸ - a Latin character with a small dot underneath the recognisable letter. In the tweet below, the d in Asda has been replaced with Ä - another character known as a crossed D. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Rachel is the eldest of four children ""I got separated from my siblings... I was told I was moved away from them because I was overprotective with them,"" 17-year-old Rachel told a committee of MPs on Tuesday. She had come to Westminster to share her experiences of being in foster care, as part of the Education Committee's inquiry into fostering. The MPs heard youngsters in care wanted more support to keep in touch with siblings and former friends, as well as more information about the foster families with whom they are placed. Rachel told MPs it was very important to keep siblings together and when she looked back on her situation, she wondered if it could have been dealt with differently. ""I was told I was moved away from them because I was overprotective with them, which in my eyes, as a sister, and you're moving away from home, I feel like it's an instinct straightaway to be protective, because you're moving in with a stranger that you don't know and you have to protect your siblings. ""But then I feel that instead of separating me from them, they could have done some work with me to say, 'The foster carer can look after your siblings,' or like tell me I don't need to do everything for them and I don't have to put a barrier up - they could have given me time to settle in so then they didn't have to separate us. ""But they separated us and then I wasn't allowed to see them for a long period of time because they said that I was giving my little sister a lot of bad memories and bad thoughts, and I was thinking, 'Have you actually sat down to question her whether she's crying because she misses me or whether she's crying because of this or this?'"" Rachel told the MPs that while she now had contact with her siblings, it was only once a month. ""We have a bond, but it's not as strong as I'd like it to be and that's quite hurtful towards me, because to lose a bond with your own siblings is sad, because you're by yourself in the world and your siblings are practically your best friends and now you're losing them - you've lost your parents and then your siblings, and it's like your whole world has crashed down really quite quickly."" Connor, 14, told the committee of MPs that when he had been moved from one placement to another, he had been given no background information about his new home and had found this very stressful. ""I didn't get much info about about the carers I was going to be with, about what the household's like - is it comfortable, is it warm? and stuff,"" he said. Asked if he had had any choice in the matter, he said no. Connor, 14, travelled to Westminster to tell his story ""I just got told the carer's name, didn't get told what they like doing, I didn't get a booklet, a prepared booklet, from anyone. ""They said that it was 'on emergency'; the carer that I was with said to me she didn't get much info on me either - the only thing she got told by the local authority was 'Can you have a 12-year-old boy on emergency?' ""They said it would be for a couple of weeks until they could find a suitable placement, but I was there for nearly a year with nothing to nudge me on that I was going to be there for a long time. ""So it was very stressful, very upsetting for me, but I've learnt to expand beyond that now and cope with it and cope with the stress - it's been a bit of a rollercoaster for me."" Connor said things could be improved if  local authorities gave both child and foster carer more information about each other. ""So that I can feel more comfortable in a home with someone that I don't know, but have got info on, so I can know what they like doing, how they are, what they're like and stuff,"" he said, ""that's how I'd improve it."" Rachel added that her second placement had been a little easier, because she had met the foster carer in advance. ""I got to go out with her, go to lunch with her, go shopping with her, meet the house, meet other people in the house, so I liked the way they did that with me because they were setting up a full-time placement with me, so they let me settle in with her before I moved straight in, which I feel they should do with most individuals or young people before they just send them off. ""On that first day when I moved in with the new foster carer, it was quite unnerving because you don't know who they are, you don't know what to expect, you don't know what it's going to like, you don't know what they're like or anything like that."" Speaking to the BBC after the committee hearing, Connor and Rachel - who are both ambassadors for the charity Action for Children - said they felt sharing their stories with MPs at Westminster had made a real difference. ""I feel we've made a massive difference. I think we've put them on the back foot and made them realise foster care in England isn't going as planned,"" said Connor. ""This is the biggest experience of our lives, to put our points across to the people who can do something about it."" Rachel said the whole experience was ""amazing"" and had inspired her to think about a career in politics. ""I want to become an MP now and get there in my own steps. I could go into that - I've set my goal high.""
