"Rekognition can match photos to databases holding millions of people's faces Shareholders seeking to halt Amazon's sale of its facial recognition technology to US police forces have been defeated in two votes that sought to pressure the company into a rethink. Civil rights campaigners had said it was,external""perhaps the most dangerous surveillance technology ever developed"". But investors rejected the proposals at the company's annual general meeting. That meant less than 50% voted for either of the measures. A breakdown of the results has yet to be disclosed. The first vote had proposed that the company should stop offering its Rekognition system to government agencies. The second had called on it to commission an independent study into whether the tech threatened people's civil rights. The ballot in Seattle would have been non-binding, meaning executives would not have had to take specific action had either been passed. Amazon had tried to block the votes but was told by the Securities and Exchange Commission that it did not have the right to do so. Rekognition gives a confidence score as to whether a person's face is a match ""We will see what the tally is, but one of our primary objectives was to bring this before shareholders and the board, and we succeeded in doing that,"" Mary Beth Gallagher from the Tri-State Coalition for Responsible Investment told the BBC. ""This is just the beginning of this movement for us and this campaign will continue. We have built links to civil rights groups, employees and other stakeholders. ""And the most important thing is that regardless of the result, we still want the board to halt sales of Rekognition to governments, and it has the capacity to do that."" The American Civil Liberties Union added that the very fact there had been a vote was ""an embarrassment to Amazon"" and should serve as a ""wake-up call for the company to reckon with the real harms of face surveillance"". Could facial recognition cut crime? San Francisco is first US city to ban facial recognition UK police 'missed' chances to improve face tech Amazon has yet to comment. But ahead of the votes it said it had not received a single report of the system being used in a harmful manner. ""[Rekognition is] a powerful tool... for law enforcement and government agencies to catch criminals, prevent crime, and find missing people,""its AGM notes state,external. ""New technology should not be banned or condemned because of its potential misuse."" Amazon has promoted its tech as a tool to fight crime Rekognition is an online tool that works with both video and still images and allows users to match faces to pre-scanned subjects in a database containing up to 20 million people provided by the client. In doing so, it gives a confidence score as to whether the ID is accurate. In addition, it can be used to: detect ""unsafe content"" such as whether there is nudity or ""revealing clothes"" on display suggest whether a subject is male or female deduce a person's mood spot text in images and transcribe it for analysis Amazonrecommends that law enforcement agents,externalshould only use the facility if there is a 99% or higher confidence rating of a match and says they should be transparent about its usage. Rekognition can be used to flag ""suggestive content"" But one force that has used the tech - Washington County Sheriff's Office in Hillsboro, Oregon, -told the Washington Post,externalthat it had done so without enforcing a minimum confidence threshold, and had run black-and-white police sketches through the system in addition to photos. Asecond force in Orlando, Florida has also tested the system,external. But Amazon has not disclosed how many other public authorities have done so. Part of Rekognition's appeal is that it is cheaper to use than several rival facial recognition technologies. But a study published in January by researchers at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the University of Toronto suggested Amazon's algorithms suffered greater gender and racial bias than four competing products. It said that Rekognition,externalhad a 0% error rate at classifying lighter-skinned males as such within a test, but a 31.4% error rate at categorising darker-skinned females. Amazon said that it ran tests against images of men and women from six ethnicities to check for signs of bias Amazonhas disputed the findings,externalsaying that the researchers had used ""an outdated version"" of its tool and that its own checks had found ""no difference"" in gender-classification across ethnicities. Even so, opposition to Rekognition has also beenvoiced by civil liberties groups,externalandhundreds of Amazon's own workers,external. Ms Gallagher said that shareholders were concerned that continued sales of Rekognition to the police risked damaging Amazon's status as ""one of the most trusted institutions in the United States"". ""We don't want it used by law enforcement because of the impact that will have on society - it might limit people's willingness to go in public spaces where they think they might be tracked,"" she said. But one of the directors from Amazon Web Services - the division responsible - had told the BBC that it should be up to politicians to decide if restrictions should be put in place. Rekognition can give a confidence score for several different features ""The right organisations to handle the issue are policymakers in government,"" Ian Massingham explained. ""The one thing I would say about deep learning technology generally is that much of the technology is based on publicly available academic research, so you can't really put the genie back in the bottle. ""Once the research is published, it's kind of hard to 'uninvent' something. ""So, our focus is on making sure the right governance and legislative controls are in place.""

"The polls have closed in the UK for the European Parliament elections. Seventy-three members, known as MEPs, will be elected in nine constituencies in England, and one each in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Each region's number of representatives is based on its population - from three MEPs in north-east England and Northern Ireland to 10 in south-east England. The results will be announced once all EU nations have voted, expected to be completed by 22:00 BST on Sunday. How the BBC reports polling day European elections: What you need to know EU citizens in UK turned away from polls The Netherlands also voted on Thursday while voting in other EU nations will take place at various times over the next three days. Voters had to be registered to vote, be 18 years old or over on 23 May, be a British, Irish or qualifying Commonwealth citizen or a citizen of an EU country. They had to be resident at a UK address (or a British citizen living abroad who has been registered to vote in the UK in the last 15 years) and not be legally excluded from voting. MEPs are elected in the order listed by their party, based on the total share of the vote in each region. In the nine English regions, Wales and Scotland, the number of MEPs is calculated using a form of proportional representation known as the D'Hondt formula, and each voter can choose one party or individual to back. The process is slightly different in Northern Ireland, where the Single Transferable Vote (STV) system is used, allowing voters to rank the parties standing in order of preference. 2019 European elections: List of candidates How do MEPs get elected?

"Commons leader Andrea Leadsom has resigned from the government amid a backlash  against Theresa May's Brexit plan from Conservative MPs. Here is her resignation letter in full: Dear prime minister I am proud to have served in your government since 2016, first as your environment secretary and for the last two years as leader of the House of Commons, and pay tribute to the excellent work of my civil servants in both roles. More recently, setting up the new complaints procedure, putting in train the restoration of the Palace of Westminster, introducing proxy voting for MPs, proposing a new strategy to support early years, and ensuring the timely delivery of our legislative programme, my role as leader of the Commons has been highly rewarding, and I am grateful to have had these opportunities. I stayed in cabinet to shape and fight for Brexit. There have been some uncomfortable compromises along the way, but you have had my determined support and loyalty in your efforts to deliver Brexit as our shared goal. I no longer believe that our approach will deliver on the referendum result, for the following reasons: 1. I do not believe that we will be a truly sovereign United Kingdom through the deal that is now proposed; 2. I have always maintained that a second referendum would be dangerously divisive, and I do not support the government willingly facilitating such a concession. It would also risk undermining our union which is something I passionately want to see strengthened; 3. There has been such a breakdown of government processes that recent Brexit-related legislative proposals have not been properly scrutinised or approved by cabinet members; 4. The tolerance to those in cabinet who have advocated policies contrary to the government's position has led to a complete breakdown of collective responsibility. I know there are important elections tomorrow, and many Conservatives have worked hard to support our excellent candidates. I considered carefully the timing of this decision, but I cannot fulfil my duty as Leader of the House tomorrow, to announce a bill with new elements that I fundamentally oppose. I fully respect the integrity, resolution and determination that you have shown during your time as prime minister. No-one has wanted you to succeed more than I have, but I do now urge you to make the right decisions In the interests of the country, this government and our party. It is therefore with great regret and with a heavy heart that I resign from the government.

"Theresa May's Brexit withdrawal bill will not be published or debated until early June, the government says. The prime minister is under pressure to resign following a backlash from her own MPs against her pledged ""new deal"" on Brexit. Andrea Leadsom quit as Commons Leader, saying she could not announce the bill which had ""new elements that I fundamentally oppose"". She has been replaced by Treasury minister Mel Stride. Downing Street has confirmed that the prime minister met Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt and Home Secretary Sajid Javid at No 10 on Thursday morning and would ""give full consideration their views"" about the bill. Mrs May hadtold the Commons,externalthat the Withdrawal Agreement Bill - the legislation needed to implement the agreement between the UK and EU - would be published on Friday so MPs would have ""the maximum possible time to study its detail"". This video can not be played Government delays Brexit bill publication Mrs Leadsom had been due to announce when it would be introduced to Parliament on Thursday, but resigned on Wednesday night. Standing in for her, government whip Mark Spencer told MPs: ""We will update the House on the publication and introduction of the Withdrawal Agreement Bill on our return from the Whitsun recess."" He added that the government planned to publish the bill in the first week of June. ""We had hoped to hold second reading on Friday 7 June,"" he added. ""At the moment, we have not secured agreement to this in the usual channels. Of course we will update the House when we return from recess."" Second reading is when MPs get a first chance to debate legislation, before deciding whether it should proceed to detailed scrutiny. Responding for Labour, shadow Commons leader Valerie Vaz said: ""The prime minister has once again put her own political survival ahead of the national interest. ""It is clear that the prime minister does not command a majority in her approach to Brexit and she has failed to accept this political reality."" US President Donald Trump is due to make a three-day state visit to the UK from 3 to 5 June. Asked who would be in 10 Downing Street when he arrives, Mr Hunt said: ""Theresa May will be prime minister to welcome him and rightly so."" It is possible for Mrs May to quit as Conservative leader before Mr Trump's visit, but continue as prime minister on a caretaker basis. Mrs Leadsom said on Thursday she had ""no doubts that I made the right decision"" adding: ""I felt I couldn't, in all conscience, stand up and deliver the business statement today with a Withdrawal Agreement Bill in it that I couldn't support elements of."" She did not answer questions about whether she was planning to run for the leadership. The UK needs to pass a law to implement the withdrawal agreement - the part of the PM's Brexit deal which will take the country out of the EU - in UK law. In a mini-reshuffle prompted by Mrs Leadsom's resignation, Mel Stride, who had been Financial Secretary to the Treasury, has replaced her as Commons leader. He has been replaced on the Treasury team by Jesse Norman, whose previous role as a transport minister has been filled by Michael Ellis. Rebecca Pow has been made a junior minister at the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, replacing Mr Ellis. On Wednesday, members of the Conservatives' backbench 1922 Committee held a secret ballot on whether to change party rules, to allow the prime minister to face a vote of no confidence immediately. Mrs May is due to meet the chairman of the committee, Sir Graham Brady, on Friday. The results, in sealed envelopes, will be opened if Mrs May does not agree to stand down by 10 June. Mrs May survived ano-confidence vote of Conservative MPs in December.Under existing rules, she cannot be challenged again until December this year.

"British Steel has been placed in compulsory liquidation, putting 5,000 jobs at risk and endangering 20,000 in the supply chain. The move follows a breakdown in rescue talks between the government and the company's owner, Greybull. The Government's Official Receiver has taken control of the company as part of the liquidation process. The search for a buyer for British Steel has already begun. In the meantime, it will trade normally. The Official Receiver said British Steel Ltd had been wound up in the High Court and the immediate priority was to continue safe operation of the site. The company was transferred to the Official Receiver because British Steel, its shareholders and the government were not able to, or would not, support the business. That meant the company did not have to funds to pay for an administration. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn and Theresa May clashed over British Steel at PMQs The other companies within the British Steel group are continuing to trade as normal and are not in insolvency. British Steel failure: The role of Greybull What are the EU rules about state aid? The Official Receiver and EY are looking for a buyer for the business. If they fail to find one, the firm would be wound up and redundancies would follow. ""I appreciate that this is a difficult time for the company's employees and I want to thank them for their ongoing co-operation,"" Receiver David Chapman said. ""The company in liquidation is continuing to trade and supply its customers while I consider options for the business. British Steel has about 5,000 employees. There are 3,000 at Scunthorpe, with another 800 on Teesside and in north-eastern England. The rest are in France, the Netherlands and various sales offices round the world. Their wages this week have been paid by Greybull and the government will pick up the bill from now on. Roy Rickhuss, general secretary of the steelworkers' trade union, Community, said: ""This news will heap more worries on workers and everyone connected with British Steel, but it will also end the uncertainty under Greybull's ownership and must be seized as an opportunity to look for an alternative future. ""It is vital now that cool heads prevail and all parties focus on saving the jobs. Kevin Prior, pictured with his partner Kayleigh Manderson, said rumours about the plant had been ""circulating for weeks"" Staff in Scunthorpe havealso reacted. ""Everyone is terrified,"" said steelworker Kevin Prior. The 32-year-old scrap metal cutter has been at the plant since 2015 and his sister and brother-in-law also work at there. He said rumours about the company's future had been circulating for a number of weeks. ""It's just heartbreaking,"" he said. ""It's horrible to hear that my sister is crying herself to sleep because she doesn't know what's going to happen with her husband's job and what that means for them."" As well as the plant's workers the North Lincolnshire town's economy relies heavily on the giant steel works, with an estimated 20,000 jobs linked to the site. Its closure would be a body blow, with some residents claiming it would leave Scunthorpe a ""ghost town"". In 2007, India's Tata conglomerate entered the UK steel market after it bought the Anglo Dutch group, Corus. In 2010, the business was renamed Tata Steel Europe. After a difficult few years, during depths of the 2016 steel crisis, Tata sold the Scunthorpe long products division to private equity firm Greybull Capital for a nominal Â£1. Greybull rebranded the company as British Steel. British Steel's more recent troubles have been linked to a slump in orders from European customers âdue to uncertainty over the Brexit process. It has has also struggled with the weakness of the pound since the EU referendum in June 2016 and the escalating US-China trade war. In a statement on Wednesday, Greybull said: ""The turnaround of British Steel was always going to be a challenge, and yet the business overcame many difficulties and until recently, looked set for renewed prosperity. ""The workforce, the trade unions and the management team have worked closely together in their determination to strengthen the business. However, the additional blows dealt by Brexit-related issues have proven insurmountable."" The High Court appointed accountancy firm EY to the role of Special Manager, assisting the Receiver. EY said the appointment of the Official Receiver followed ""a number of weeks"" of negotiations by management with the company's various stakeholders, including lenders, shareholders and the government, to secure the necessary funding to avoid an insolvency. ""Regrettably, these efforts were unable to secure a solution before the company's funding resources were exhausted."" British Steel customer Network Rail sources 95% of its rails from British Steel's Scunthorpe plant. In a statement, the rail infrastructure operator said it had been working closely with British Steel and the government for ""many weeks"". ""We have done what we can to help ease the company's financial difficulties. We have improved our order book with the company - increasing rail production volumes, bringing orders forward and committing to a long term schedule - as well as offering immediate payment to ease the pressure on cash flow."" It is understood the company has enough stockpiles to keep it going until other suppliers can increase production. Business Secretary Greg Clark said the government had shown its ""willingness to act"", having provided the British Steel with a Â£120m bridging loan in April to meet EU emission rules and avoid a steep fine. However, he added: ""The government can only act within the law, which requires any financial support to a steel company to be on a commercial basis. I have been advised that it would be unlawful to provide a guarantee or loan on the terms of any proposals that the company or any other party has made."" Labour's shadow business secretary, Rebecca Long Bailey, called for the company to be nationalised. She said: ""The government must act quickly to save this strategically important industry and the livelihoods and communities of those who work in it, by bringing British Steel into public ownership.''

"This video can not be played Trump to Pelosi: ""I don't do cover-ups"" US President Donald Trump has angrily lashed out at Democratic leaders' claims he is engaged in a ""cover-up"". ""I don't do cover-ups,"" the Republican president said in an unscheduled briefing from the White House. His remarks came after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi met fellow Democrats to discuss impeaching the president. Mr Trump is fighting congressional inquiries by ignoring subpoenas, withholding documents and blocking testimony by current and ex-advisers. Allow Twitter content?

The president spoke minutes after cutting short a planned meeting with the two top Democratic leaders on Capitol Hill. The trio were due to discuss spending on ageing US roads and bridges, a rare possible area of agreement between the White House and its political antagonists. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (centre) and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (right) speak to the media But Mr Trump abruptly left the discussion with House of Representatives leader Mrs Pelosi and her Senate counterpart Chuck Schumer after barely five minutes. The president then appeared in the Rose Garden to make a surprise statement, condemning ""phoney investigations"" by Democrats. Mr Trump also charged his political opponents with ""abuse"" and railed against their invoking of ""the big i word"" - impeachment. According to CBS News, Mr Trump walked into the meeting with Mrs Pelosi and Mr Schumer and did not shake either's hand or sit down. An unnamed source familiar with the encounter said Mr Trump upbraided the House speaker for her ""terrible"" allegation earlier in the day about a cover-up. The president demanded Democrats end their investigations against him, or he would not discuss anything else, then abruptly left the room. Five looming fights between Congress and Trump Mrs Pelosi did not back down, later specifically mentioning the US constitutional process for removing a president from office. She said at an event in Washington: ""The fact is, in plain sight in the public domain, this president is obstructing justice and he's engaged in a cover-up - and that could be an impeachable offence."" At a press conference earlier with Mrs Pelosi, Mr Schumer accused Mr Trump of ""running away"". ""When we got in the room, the curtains were closed,"" the New York senator said about their brief meeting. ""There was a place for him at the front so he could stand and attempt to tell us why he wouldn't do infrastructure, and of course, then he went to the Rose Garden with prepared signs that had been printed long before our meeting."" After the Mueller investigation concluded, Donald Trump and his advocates cheered what they saw as a cloud over the White House finally lifting. It turns out, however, the political weather is still gloomy. Congressional Democrats have picked up the mantle of the inquiry, issuing a flurry of subpoenas. Now Mr Trump, in what was clearly a pre-planned response, is pushing back. Co-operation and investigation, the president asserts, are mutually exclusive. Hopes of a legislative infrastructure deal have been dashed. Of greater immediate concern, however, is the status of negotiations on approving a new spending plan and raising the debt ceiling. If Republicans in Congress follow the president's lead and dig in their heels, a new round of budget crises could be on the way. An infrastructure plan appeared to be the best way for the president and Democrats to enact substantive legislation that they could take credit for on the 2020 campaign trail. If the current course continues, however, the two sides will instead be fighting over who should shoulder the most blame. This video can not be played The Mueller report - in 60 seconds Democrats on Capitol Hill have launched a number of oversight inquiries into Mr Trump, stemming from a special counsel report into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 US presidential election. Robert Mueller's investigation did not establish any conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Kremlin, but listed repeated instances of possible obstruction of justice by the president. On Wednesday alone, the president's political foes stepped closer towards obtaining his closely guarded accounts. A New York judge ruled that the president's financial records could be provided to Democratic lawmakers by Deutsche Bank and Capital One bank. And New York's Democratic-controlled state legislature approved a bill designed to unseal the president's tax returns, which he has repeatedly prevaricated about disclosing. Earlier this week, a federal judge ruled that Mr Trump could not block a subpoena ordering his accounting firm to turn over his financial records to Congress. This video can not be played What does it take to impeach a president? On Monday, meanwhile, Mr Trump directed his former White House counsel Don McGahn to ignore a summons to testify to the House Judiciary Committee. The panel responded by issuing subpoenas to two former White House staff members, including ex-communications director Hope Hicks. Eight key findings in the Mueller report As Mr Trump stonewalls congressional investigations, Mrs Pelosi has been trying to tamp down increasing clamour among her fellow Democrats for impeachment proceedings. On Wednesday, she met members of her party in a closed-door session and argued the time was not right for impeaching the president. It was as she emerged from this caucus meeting that Mrs Pelosi angered the president by suggesting to reporters that he was involved in a cover-up. The House leader has also said she believes the president is ""goading"" Democrats into pushing for impeachment. A freshman Democratic congresswoman, Katie Hill,told the Associated Press,externalafter Wednesday's meeting that impeachment was ""becoming an inevitability"" with every act of defiance from the president. Impeachment would need to be approved a majority in the Democratic-controlled House, but it would stand virtually no chance of passing the Republican-controlled Senate. Only two other presidents have been impeached: Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton.

Theresa May could meet the foreign secretary tomorrow In a sign of unrest at the highest levels of the Tory party, a series of cabinet ministers asked for meetings with Mrs May today to raise their concerns about the Withdrawal Agreement Bill. Downing Street sources told the Press Association it was possible that the PM could meet Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt on Thursday, but there was no confirmation that an audience would be granted for other ministers with reservations about the plan. Home Secretary Sajid Javid has asked for a meeting to discuss his concerns about the prospect of a second referendum, after Mrs May revealed she would grant MPs a vote on whether the Brexit deal should be put to the public. Theresa May has experienced more cabinet resignations than any prime minister since the beginning of Margaret Thatcher's reign - and in a much shorter time. With all of this drama in Westminster ongoing, it would be easy to forget about the little matter of the European elections. As ITV political correspondent Paul Brand points out, the polls for the elections open in less than nine hours. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"France won the 2018 World Cup in Russia Plans to expand the 2022 World Cup to 48 teams have been abandoned by Fifa. Fifa president Gianni Infantinosaid last yearthe expansion from 32 teams could be brought forward from 2026 to the 2022 tournament in Qatar. The change would have required Qatar to share hosting duties with other countries in the region. World football's governing body said after a ""thorough and comprehensive consultation process"" the change ""could not be made now"". Fifa also said it explored the possibility of Qatar hosting a 48-team tournament on its own but has decided not to pursue those plans as there was not enough time ""for a detailed assessment of the potential logistical impact"". In a statement, Qatari World Cup organisers said: ""Qatar had always been open to the idea of an expanded tournament in 2022 had a viable operating model been found and had all parties concluded that an expanded 48-team edition was in the best interest of football and Qatar as the host nation. ""With just three and a half years to go until kick off, Qatar remains as committed as ever to ensuring the 32-team Fifa World Cup in 2022 is one of the best tournaments ever and one that makes the entire Arab world proud."" In November, Uefa president Aleksander Ceferin said adding 16 teams to Qatar 2022 could create ""many problems"" and described the idea as ""quite unrealistic"". 'A 48-team World Cup makes me want Blatter back' Fifa warned of human rights issues if World Cup expanded US, Canada & Mexico win right to host 2026 World Cup BBC sports editor Dan Roan Those close to the Qatar 2022 organisers say this is a mutual decision that realigns them and Fifa, and that they are now concentrating on delivering the best possible 32-team World Cup. But it will also have come as a major relief to the hosts, who no longer have to worry about sharing football's showpiece event. Perhaps with the Nobel Peace Prize in mind, Fifa president Gianni Infantino had pushed for an expansion against Qatar's wishes, hoping it may help heal diplomatic tensions in the region by staging some games in other countries, but he has now had to admit defeat. With Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain all maintaining a blockade of neighbouring Qatar, such an audacious move was never going to be straightforward. The crisis left only Kuwait and Oman as potential co-hosts, but a Fifa study concluded that neither would meet all logistical requirements. Infantino has previously collaborated with Saudi Arabiawhen proposing a revamped Club World Cup, and many suspected this was linked to his suggestion that the country could be part of the solution for an expanded 2022 tournament. But given the condemnation that followed themurder of journalist Jamal Khashoggiat the country's consulate in Istanbul last year, along with its role in Yemen's bloody civil war, such a step would have sparked a major backlash from human rights campaigners, as it would have done if the UAE had been awarded games. So while some national football associations and Infantino will no doubt be disappointed at the news, many others will welcome it. This video can not be played January 2017: Expansion is 21st century move - Infantino In January 2017, Fifa voted unanimously in favour of increasing the World Cup to 48 teams for the 2026 event - which will be held in the United States, Canada and Mexico. In October 2018 Infantino said ""we have to see if it is possible"" to bring the expansion forward to 2022. Infantino has been a strong advocate of the expansion and said the World Cup has to be ""more inclusive"". ""We are in the 21st century and we have to shape the World Cup of the 21st century,"" he said when announcing the change. ""It is the future. Football is more than just Europe and South America, football is global."" The expansion in 2026 will see an initial stage of 16 groups of three teams precede a knockout stage for the remaining 32. The number of tournament matches will rise to 80, from 64, but the eventual winners will still play only seven games. The tournament will be completed within 32 days - a measure to appease powerful European clubs, who objected to reform because of a crowded international schedule.

"Two men have been shot dead in separate incidents in County Dublin in less than 24 hours. On Tuesday night, a man was found dead beside a burning car at Rowans Little in Walshestown, near Balbriggan in north County Dublin. He has been identified as as 22-year-old SeÃ¡n Little from Coolock in Dublin. It is understood he was known to gardaÃ­ (Irish police) because of his links with organised crime. According to Irish broadcaster RTÃ, he was an associate of the leader of a Finglas-based organised crime gang, involved in an ongoing feud with a Blanchardstown drugs gang. He also had close links to theKinahan crime gang., RTÃ reports. Police vehicles and investigators at the scene of the first incident in Walshestown GardaÃ­ said he was shot a number of times before his body was discovered at about 23:20 local time. On Wednesday afternoon, a second man was shot dead on the north side of Dublin. He was killed on Marigold Road in the Darndale area at about 16:00 local time. The scene of a fatal shooting in the Darndale area of Dublin Initial reports suggest the victim was known to gardaÃ­ and that the shooting could be drugs related. However, it is not known if the two deaths are connected. A burnt-out car was removed from the scene of the first incident following a forensic examination Shane Harrison, BBC News NI Ireland correspondent In the first incident, the fact that the body was found beside a burnt-out car may suggest the victim was murdered somewhere else and taken to the scene, off the Belfast-to-Dublin motorway, before being dropped from the vehicle near the exit close to Balbriggan. Although it is early in the investigation, detectives are keenly aware of three ongoing gangland feuds: one in Drogheda, a few kilometres north, and another in Blanchardstown in west Dublin - both are over the drugs trade. And then there is the on-going Kinahan-Hutch feud that began in 2015 and is believed to have claimed 17 lives so far.

"Rekognition can match photos to databases holding millions of people's faces Shareholders seeking to halt Amazon's sale of its facial recognition technology to US police forces have been defeated in two votes that sought to pressure the company into a rethink. Civil rights campaigners had said it was,external""perhaps the most dangerous surveillance technology ever developed"". But investors rejected the proposals at the company's annual general meeting. That meant less than 50% voted for either of the measures. A breakdown of the results has yet to be disclosed. The first vote had proposed that the company should stop offering its Rekognition system to government agencies. The second had called on it to commission an independent study into whether the tech threatened people's civil rights. The ballot in Seattle would have been non-binding, meaning executives would not have had to take specific action had either been passed. Amazon had tried to block the votes but was told by the Securities and Exchange Commission that it did not have the right to do so. Rekognition gives a confidence score as to whether a person's face is a match ""We will see what the tally is, but one of our primary objectives was to bring this before shareholders and the board, and we succeeded in doing that,"" Mary Beth Gallagher from the Tri-State Coalition for Responsible Investment told the BBC. ""This is just the beginning of this movement for us and this campaign will continue. We have built links to civil rights groups, employees and other stakeholders. ""And the most important thing is that regardless of the result, we still want the board to halt sales of Rekognition to governments, and it has the capacity to do that."" The American Civil Liberties Union added that the very fact there had been a vote was ""an embarrassment to Amazon"" and should serve as a ""wake-up call for the company to reckon with the real harms of face surveillance"". Could facial recognition cut crime? San Francisco is first US city to ban facial recognition UK police 'missed' chances to improve face tech Amazon has yet to comment. But ahead of the votes it said it had not received a single report of the system being used in a harmful manner. ""[Rekognition is] a powerful tool... for law enforcement and government agencies to catch criminals, prevent crime, and find missing people,""its AGM notes state,external. ""New technology should not be banned or condemned because of its potential misuse."" Amazon has promoted its tech as a tool to fight crime Rekognition is an online tool that works with both video and still images and allows users to match faces to pre-scanned subjects in a database containing up to 20 million people provided by the client. In doing so, it gives a confidence score as to whether the ID is accurate. In addition, it can be used to: detect ""unsafe content"" such as whether there is nudity or ""revealing clothes"" on display suggest whether a subject is male or female deduce a person's mood spot text in images and transcribe it for analysis Amazonrecommends that law enforcement agents,externalshould only use the facility if there is a 99% or higher confidence rating of a match and says they should be transparent about its usage. Rekognition can be used to flag ""suggestive content"" But one force that has used the tech - Washington County Sheriff's Office in Hillsboro, Oregon, -told the Washington Post,externalthat it had done so without enforcing a minimum confidence threshold, and had run black-and-white police sketches through the system in addition to photos. Asecond force in Orlando, Florida has also tested the system,external. But Amazon has not disclosed how many other public authorities have done so. Part of Rekognition's appeal is that it is cheaper to use than several rival facial recognition technologies. But a study published in January by researchers at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the University of Toronto suggested Amazon's algorithms suffered greater gender and racial bias than four competing products. It said that Rekognition,externalhad a 0% error rate at classifying lighter-skinned males as such within a test, but a 31.4% error rate at categorising darker-skinned females. Amazon said that it ran tests against images of men and women from six ethnicities to check for signs of bias Amazonhas disputed the findings,externalsaying that the researchers had used ""an outdated version"" of its tool and that its own checks had found ""no difference"" in gender-classification across ethnicities. Even so, opposition to Rekognition has also beenvoiced by civil liberties groups,externalandhundreds of Amazon's own workers,external. Ms Gallagher said that shareholders were concerned that continued sales of Rekognition to the police risked damaging Amazon's status as ""one of the most trusted institutions in the United States"". ""We don't want it used by law enforcement because of the impact that will have on society - it might limit people's willingness to go in public spaces where they think they might be tracked,"" she said. But one of the directors from Amazon Web Services - the division responsible - had told the BBC that it should be up to politicians to decide if restrictions should be put in place. Rekognition can give a confidence score for several different features ""The right organisations to handle the issue are policymakers in government,"" Ian Massingham explained. ""The one thing I would say about deep learning technology generally is that much of the technology is based on publicly available academic research, so you can't really put the genie back in the bottle. ""Once the research is published, it's kind of hard to 'uninvent' something. ""So, our focus is on making sure the right governance and legislative controls are in place.""

"Topshop tycoon Sir Philip Green plans to close 23 stores, putting 520 jobs under threat, as part of a rescue plan. Under the proposal, Burton, Dorothy Perkins and Topshop stores will close and rents will be cut at another 194 stores at the Arcadia group. However, the pensions regulator has doubts that the deal will ""adequately protect"" the pensions of employees. The regulator's support is crucial in order for a Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA) to be approved. CVAs are a type of insolvency for troubled businesses that allows rents to be cut. There are seven in total and all must be approved by creditors. The proposal states that Arcadia Group is prepared to put an additional Â£100m into the scheme over a number of years to bridge a shortfall in pension contributions, but the regulator does not think the plans are sufficient. Ian Grabiner, chief executive of Arcadia Group, called the steps ""tough but necessary"" to mend the business. The company also plans to shut all its 11 Topshop and Topman stores in the US. Philip Green: what's gone wrong at his Topshop empire? Sir Philip Green's Arcadia Group seeks to to cut costs US investor sells Topshop shares back to Sir Philip Green The closures would add to the 200 UK stores shut over the past three years as it struggles with a challenging market. They are seen as a final effort by a company to stave off administration or breakup. Many retail experts believe Topshop, Sir Philip's prize asset, has fallen out of favour with today's young consumers, who are favouring online retailers such as Asos and Pretty Little Thing. It is another blow to the tycoon, who this month lost his Sunday Times Rich List billionaire status. In return for the rent cuts, Sir Philip's wife, Lady Tina Green, who is the main shareholder of Arcadia, will invest Â£50m in the company. Landlords, thought to number in the hundreds, and other creditors will have to agree to the proposal, which will be put to them on 5 June. The deal will see them owning 20% of the firm, while they will also be able to claim against a Â£40m ""compromised creditor"" fund. It has not been made clear just how steep a rent reduction they are being asked to provide. Sir Philip's Arcadia group has 1,170 shops in 36 countries, although the majority are concessions or franchises. It has 566 locations in the UK and Ireland, employing 18,000 people. The plan must also be approved by the company's pension trustees, who are also being offered a new deal. The company has been topping up the two largest Arcadia pension schemes by Â£50m a year. This will be cut to Â£25m, but Lady Tina will make up the shortfall for three years and add another payment of Â£25m. Sir Philip's US stores were opened with great fanfare Sir Philip Green's brands used to dominate the High Street. He was the king of retail, making a fortune in the process. He famously took out a Â£1.2bn dividend from Arcadia back in 2005, the largest corporate payout in UK history. But this once powerful retail empire is now in serious trouble. Dorothy Perkins, Burtons and Miss Selfridge fell out of fashion a long time ago. Topshop has long been the jewel in the Arcadia crown but it too is struggling. It's no longer the go-to place for young fashion-seekers. Behind the scenes, his brands have suffered from years of underinvestment. But, like other traditional retailers, Arcadia is also been hit by rising costs like business rates and wages as well as our changing shopping habits. Sales are on the slide. This restructuring deal, which must be approved by landlords and the Pension Protection Fund, is a pivotal moment for Sir Philip and his business. If he doesn't succeed, administration looms. His aim is to put the group on a more sustainable footing so a turnaround plan can be put in place. But launching a CVA, even though they're in fashion, is a dramatic fall from grace for a businessman whose glory days seem long gone. Last year, landlords called for a government review as more struggling retailers asked for rent reductions. The British Property Federation (BPF) said too many companies were abusing CVAs and using them to dodge rent. The BPF said that it would be for individual property owners to decide on how they would vote on Arcadia's plan. New Look, Carpetright, House of Fraser and Mothercare are among retailers that used the process to shore up their finances. Last year, Sir Philip was embroiled in claims, which he strongly denied, of bullying and inappropriate behaviour. He was also criticised over the demise of department store chain BHS, which, after he sold it for just Â£1, collapsed a year later. It emerged in January that the business had hired advisers at Deloitte to explore a restructuring, prompted by a decline in sales and profits. What's gone wrong at Green's Topshop empire?

"This video can not be played Trump to Pelosi: ""I don't do cover-ups"" US President Donald Trump has angrily lashed out at Democratic leaders' claims he is engaged in a ""cover-up"". ""I don't do cover-ups,"" the Republican president said in an unscheduled briefing from the White House. His remarks came after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi met fellow Democrats to discuss impeaching the president. Mr Trump is fighting congressional inquiries by ignoring subpoenas, withholding documents and blocking testimony by current and ex-advisers. Allow Twitter content?

The president spoke minutes after cutting short a planned meeting with the two top Democratic leaders on Capitol Hill. The trio were due to discuss spending on ageing US roads and bridges, a rare possible area of agreement between the White House and its political antagonists. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (centre) and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (right) speak to the media But Mr Trump abruptly left the discussion with House of Representatives leader Mrs Pelosi and her Senate counterpart Chuck Schumer after barely five minutes. The president then appeared in the Rose Garden to make a surprise statement, condemning ""phoney investigations"" by Democrats. Mr Trump also charged his political opponents with ""abuse"" and railed against their invoking of ""the big i word"" - impeachment. According to CBS News, Mr Trump walked into the meeting with Mrs Pelosi and Mr Schumer and did not shake either's hand or sit down. An unnamed source familiar with the encounter said Mr Trump upbraided the House speaker for her ""terrible"" allegation earlier in the day about a cover-up. The president demanded Democrats end their investigations against him, or he would not discuss anything else, then abruptly left the room. Five looming fights between Congress and Trump Mrs Pelosi did not back down, later specifically mentioning the US constitutional process for removing a president from office. She said at an event in Washington: ""The fact is, in plain sight in the public domain, this president is obstructing justice and he's engaged in a cover-up - and that could be an impeachable offence."" At a press conference earlier with Mrs Pelosi, Mr Schumer accused Mr Trump of ""running away"". ""When we got in the room, the curtains were closed,"" the New York senator said about their brief meeting. ""There was a place for him at the front so he could stand and attempt to tell us why he wouldn't do infrastructure, and of course, then he went to the Rose Garden with prepared signs that had been printed long before our meeting."" After the Mueller investigation concluded, Donald Trump and his advocates cheered what they saw as a cloud over the White House finally lifting. It turns out, however, the political weather is still gloomy. Congressional Democrats have picked up the mantle of the inquiry, issuing a flurry of subpoenas. Now Mr Trump, in what was clearly a pre-planned response, is pushing back. Co-operation and investigation, the president asserts, are mutually exclusive. Hopes of a legislative infrastructure deal have been dashed. Of greater immediate concern, however, is the status of negotiations on approving a new spending plan and raising the debt ceiling. If Republicans in Congress follow the president's lead and dig in their heels, a new round of budget crises could be on the way. An infrastructure plan appeared to be the best way for the president and Democrats to enact substantive legislation that they could take credit for on the 2020 campaign trail. If the current course continues, however, the two sides will instead be fighting over who should shoulder the most blame. This video can not be played The Mueller report - in 60 seconds Democrats on Capitol Hill have launched a number of oversight inquiries into Mr Trump, stemming from a special counsel report into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 US presidential election. Robert Mueller's investigation did not establish any conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Kremlin, but listed repeated instances of possible obstruction of justice by the president. On Wednesday alone, the president's political foes stepped closer towards obtaining his closely guarded accounts. A New York judge ruled that the president's financial records could be provided to Democratic lawmakers by Deutsche Bank and Capital One bank. And New York's Democratic-controlled state legislature approved a bill designed to unseal the president's tax returns, which he has repeatedly prevaricated about disclosing. Earlier this week, a federal judge ruled that Mr Trump could not block a subpoena ordering his accounting firm to turn over his financial records to Congress. This video can not be played What does it take to impeach a president? On Monday, meanwhile, Mr Trump directed his former White House counsel Don McGahn to ignore a summons to testify to the House Judiciary Committee. The panel responded by issuing subpoenas to two former White House staff members, including ex-communications director Hope Hicks. Eight key findings in the Mueller report As Mr Trump stonewalls congressional investigations, Mrs Pelosi has been trying to tamp down increasing clamour among her fellow Democrats for impeachment proceedings. On Wednesday, she met members of her party in a closed-door session and argued the time was not right for impeaching the president. It was as she emerged from this caucus meeting that Mrs Pelosi angered the president by suggesting to reporters that he was involved in a cover-up. The House leader has also said she believes the president is ""goading"" Democrats into pushing for impeachment. A freshman Democratic congresswoman, Katie Hill,told the Associated Press,externalafter Wednesday's meeting that impeachment was ""becoming an inevitability"" with every act of defiance from the president. Impeachment would need to be approved a majority in the Democratic-controlled House, but it would stand virtually no chance of passing the Republican-controlled Senate. Only two other presidents have been impeached: Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton.

"Geoff Ho was in Black and Blue - next to Borough Market - when the attackers entered The London Bridge attackers stalked people who were in a bar-restaurant like ""predators"", a man who was stabbed has told the inquest. Geoff Ho was in Black and Blue, on the edge of Borough Market, when the three attackers entered with ""slow, deliberate predatory movements"". He was among 48 people injured on the evening of 3 June 2017. Khuram Butt, 27, Rachid Redouane, 30, and Youssef Zaghba, 22, killed eight people with their van and knife attack. Speaking at the Old Bailey, Mr Ho told the inquest: ""It was like they were stalking someone."" He said he refused the attackers' demands to lie down on the floor, saying he knew ""if I lay down I'd be dead"". He told the court they were wearing a series of ""metal canisters liked baked bean tins"" with wires connecting them, which he took to be suicide bombs. After being told by one of the men to lie on the floor, he told the court he said: ""No - you don't have to do this."" London Bridge attack: What happened Victims of the London Bridge attack He said he thought: ""If I rush him he might detonate and kill us all. The only thing I can do is talk to him and hopefully he will go away."" He described the ""murderous rage"" in the man's eyes. Mr Ho gave a graphic description of how he was repeatedly stabbed. Eventually he was able to get up and seek help, with his hand clasped around his throat to stop the bleeding. CCTV footage later showed that the time taken from the three men entering the bar until they lashed out was less than a minute. Mr Ho told the court: ""It seemed longer."" Geoff Ho and his fiancee Cecile De Alenca The first 10 days of the inquests focused on the eight people killed in the first few minutes of the attack. The hearing has now begun to look into the next phase - as Redouane, Butt and Zaghba continued stabbing people in bars, restaurants and on the street in the Borough Market area. Candice Hedge - a waitress at Elliot's Cafe, opposite Black and Blue - described how customers were ""scrambling to try to get a safe spot"" when the three attackers came in. She said she remembered seeing ""some sort of wires"" on one of the men, which she thought looked like an explosive vest. ""They were shouting something along the lines of they were not happy with the way we were living our lives,"" Ms Hedge added. Mr Ho and Candice Hedge both gave evidence to the inquest on Wednesday She saw one of the men stab a customer twice in the back and then ""the one beside me turned around as if to leave and then he saw me"". Ms Hedge put her hands up to protect her face, but was stabbed in the neck. She went to the bar and grabbed a napkin which she used to try and stem the bleeding. She said she moved to the stairs and could not see what the attacker was doing, but could hear bar stools smashing. She fled to a downstairs kitchen where she waited with colleagues until police arrived about 20-30 minutes later. Meanwhile, the last person injured in the attack - Antonio Filis - told the court he felt lucky to be alive after a knife wound narrowly missed his lung. The inquest heard he had had martial arts training some years before and was initially able to use it to avoid the assailant's knife. But the other two attackers joined the assault stabbing Mr Filis several times. As he lay on the ground, Mr Filis said he thought: ""Whatever's going to happen, please make it quick."" US man 'flatlined twice' after London attack Doctor 'ran from bar to save attack victims' Almost immediately, armed police arrived and the three attackers left him. The trio moved towards the officers, who warned them to drop their knives before opening fire, hitting all three of the attackers. Xavier Thomas, 45, Christine Archibald, 30, Sara Zelenak, 21, Sebastien Belanger, 36, James McMullan, 32, Kirsty Boden, 28, Alexandre Pigeard, 26, and Ignacio Echeverria, 39, were all killed in the attack. It was brought to an end in less than 10 minutes when the attackers were shot dead.

"Rekognition can match photos to databases holding millions of people's faces Shareholders seeking to halt Amazon's sale of its facial recognition technology to US police forces have been defeated in two votes that sought to pressure the company into a rethink. Civil rights campaigners had said it was,external""perhaps the most dangerous surveillance technology ever developed"". But investors rejected the proposals at the company's annual general meeting. That meant less than 50% voted for either of the measures. A breakdown of the results has yet to be disclosed. The first vote had proposed that the company should stop offering its Rekognition system to government agencies. The second had called on it to commission an independent study into whether the tech threatened people's civil rights. The ballot in Seattle would have been non-binding, meaning executives would not have had to take specific action had either been passed. Amazon had tried to block the votes but was told by the Securities and Exchange Commission that it did not have the right to do so. Rekognition gives a confidence score as to whether a person's face is a match ""We will see what the tally is, but one of our primary objectives was to bring this before shareholders and the board, and we succeeded in doing that,"" Mary Beth Gallagher from the Tri-State Coalition for Responsible Investment told the BBC. ""This is just the beginning of this movement for us and this campaign will continue. We have built links to civil rights groups, employees and other stakeholders. ""And the most important thing is that regardless of the result, we still want the board to halt sales of Rekognition to governments, and it has the capacity to do that."" The American Civil Liberties Union added that the very fact there had been a vote was ""an embarrassment to Amazon"" and should serve as a ""wake-up call for the company to reckon with the real harms of face surveillance"". Could facial recognition cut crime? San Francisco is first US city to ban facial recognition UK police 'missed' chances to improve face tech Amazon has yet to comment. But ahead of the votes it said it had not received a single report of the system being used in a harmful manner. ""[Rekognition is] a powerful tool... for law enforcement and government agencies to catch criminals, prevent crime, and find missing people,""its AGM notes state,external. ""New technology should not be banned or condemned because of its potential misuse."" Amazon has promoted its tech as a tool to fight crime Rekognition is an online tool that works with both video and still images and allows users to match faces to pre-scanned subjects in a database containing up to 20 million people provided by the client. In doing so, it gives a confidence score as to whether the ID is accurate. In addition, it can be used to: detect ""unsafe content"" such as whether there is nudity or ""revealing clothes"" on display suggest whether a subject is male or female deduce a person's mood spot text in images and transcribe it for analysis Amazonrecommends that law enforcement agents,externalshould only use the facility if there is a 99% or higher confidence rating of a match and says they should be transparent about its usage. Rekognition can be used to flag ""suggestive content"" But one force that has used the tech - Washington County Sheriff's Office in Hillsboro, Oregon, -told the Washington Post,externalthat it had done so without enforcing a minimum confidence threshold, and had run black-and-white police sketches through the system in addition to photos. Asecond force in Orlando, Florida has also tested the system,external. But Amazon has not disclosed how many other public authorities have done so. Part of Rekognition's appeal is that it is cheaper to use than several rival facial recognition technologies. But a study published in January by researchers at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the University of Toronto suggested Amazon's algorithms suffered greater gender and racial bias than four competing products. It said that Rekognition,externalhad a 0% error rate at classifying lighter-skinned males as such within a test, but a 31.4% error rate at categorising darker-skinned females. Amazon said that it ran tests against images of men and women from six ethnicities to check for signs of bias Amazonhas disputed the findings,externalsaying that the researchers had used ""an outdated version"" of its tool and that its own checks had found ""no difference"" in gender-classification across ethnicities. Even so, opposition to Rekognition has also beenvoiced by civil liberties groups,externalandhundreds of Amazon's own workers,external. Ms Gallagher said that shareholders were concerned that continued sales of Rekognition to the police risked damaging Amazon's status as ""one of the most trusted institutions in the United States"". ""We don't want it used by law enforcement because of the impact that will have on society - it might limit people's willingness to go in public spaces where they think they might be tracked,"" she said. But one of the directors from Amazon Web Services - the division responsible - had told the BBC that it should be up to politicians to decide if restrictions should be put in place. Rekognition can give a confidence score for several different features ""The right organisations to handle the issue are policymakers in government,"" Ian Massingham explained. ""The one thing I would say about deep learning technology generally is that much of the technology is based on publicly available academic research, so you can't really put the genie back in the bottle. ""Once the research is published, it's kind of hard to 'uninvent' something. ""So, our focus is on making sure the right governance and legislative controls are in place.""

"The prime minister is resisting calls to resign despite a growing backlash against her Brexit plan from Conservative MPs. Several cabinet ministers told the BBC that she cannot stay, with one saying it is ""the end of the line"". Tory backbenchers met on Wednesday evening, but decided not to change rules which would have allowed an immediate vote of no confidence in her. The BBC's political editor says the PM seems to have bought herself 36 hours. Mrs May will meet the chairman of the influential backbench 1922 Committee, Sir Graham Brady, on Friday. In the meantime, the UK will vote on Thursday in European Parliament elections, with the Conservatives widely predicted to do very badly. Allow Twitter content?

Discontent at Mrs May's leadership grew significantly after she set out plans for the Withdrawal Agreement Bill - the legislation needed to implement the agreement between the UK and EU on the terms of Brexit. It included a number of concessions designed to attract cross-party support, including new guarantees on workers' rights, environmental protections and the Northern Irish border, as well a customs ""compromise"". Latest: Reaction to PM's Brexit ""compromise"" offer No 10 plans to stand firm as PM's future unclear But Brexiteers in her own party reacted angrily to it, particularly a promise to give MPs a vote on another referendum if they backed the bill. Mrs May insists it is Parliament's ""last chance"" to get Brexit done. Several cabinet ministers broke cover on Wednesday afternoon to signal their unhappiness with the bill, among them Home Secretary Sajid Javid. Allow Twitter content?

Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt also requested a private meeting with the PM. But Laura Kuenssberg said the PM declined to meet the ministers - both of whom are seen as possible contenders to be the next Conservative leader - and instead seemed determined to ""tough it out"". Sources told the BBC the chief whip, Julian Smith, made it clear to backbench MPs that the prime minister was not resigning. The 1922 Committee had been expected to vote on Wednesday evening on whether to change the party's rules to allow an immediate vote of no confidence in the prime minister. Current rules dictate that as the PM survived such a vote in December, she cannot face another one for 12 months. However, the vote on a rule change did not take place - and afterwards, some members expressed their discontent. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The PM has already pledged to set a timetable for a new leader to take over after MPs vote on the Withdrawal Agreement Bill - in theory, on 7 June. But calls for her to go sooner than that have begun to come from Conservatives who had, until now, stayed loyal. PM under fire over new Brexit plan Is May's 'new' Brexit deal actually new? Writing in the Financial Times,external, Tom Tugendhat said: ""Leadership matters; it has been absent for too long,"" he said. ""This can only change with a new prime minister."" Former minister Tim Loughton said it was ""very sad"", but it was time for her to go - another, Stephen Crabb, said there needs to be a new PM ""within weeks"". More familiar critics also added to the clamour for her resignation. Leading Brexiteer Steve Baker said it was ""not personal"" but about ""the future of the country"", and his party ""needs to reassemble a governing coalition willing to take us out of the EU"", under a new leader. There have been doubts about Theresa May's leadership for many months. She herself has more or less said she will resign next month. But something different has happened today, the mood has really changed. More and more Conservatives publicly are saying she has to quit as soon as possible. Ministers have been saying to me privately she has now reached the end of line. Number 10 is adamant, though, that nothing has really changed she will press on and still try and get her Brexit deal though. But it feels the government is almost in breakdown. And it's simply not clear at this moment they'll really be able to hang on. The UK was meant to leave the EU on 29 March, but that has been pushed back to 31 October after the Commons rejected Mrs May's withdrawal deal with Brussels three times. Attempts to find a cross-party compromise via formal talks broke down last week, and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has rejected Mrs May's attempts to win his MPs over with her Brexit withdrawal bill plan. Mr Corbyn said her ""bold new deal"" was really a ""repackaged version"" of her failed withdrawal agreement, adding: ""No Labour MP can vote for a deal with the promise of a prime minister who only has days left in her job."" He said the issue of Brexit had been ""dividing our society and poisoning our democracy"", but claimed Mrs May's deal ""does not represent a genuine compromise"". Addressing her critics in the Commons earlier, Mrs May said: ""In time, another prime minister will be standing at this despatch box, but while I am here, I have a duty to be clear with the House about the facts. ""If we are going to deliver Brexit in this Parliament, we have to pass a Withdrawal Agreement Bill, and we will not do so without holding votes on the issues that have divided us the most,"" she said. ""In the end, our job in the House is to take decisions, not duck them."" The SNP's leader in Westminster Ian Blackford - who supports a further referendum to remain in the EU - said it was time for the prime minister to go, having ""lost the trust of the public"". ""This deal is dead,"" he added. The DUP, which props up Mrs May's government, has also refused the vote for the bill. Labour's Liz Kendall backed the call for a public vote, telling Mrs May she will not get enough support for her bill from opposition members without including a confirmatory ballot as part of the deal - rather than just offering a vote on whether to have one. But Conservative MP Vicky Ford said: ""We cannot continue to leave our country in this uncertainty. It has to stop. The whole House has to stop saying no to everything on the table just because it is not our favourite dish. ""If we vote for this bill we can move on and the discussion on the next stage can start."" This video can not be played Theresa May says failure to back her deal risks ""no Brexit at all"" Mrs May is bringing the Withdrawal Agreement Bill - legislation required to bring her agreement into UK law - to Parliament in early June. In an attempt to win over MPs across the House, she announced the following concessions: A guarantee of a Commons vote on whether to hold another referendum on the government's Brexit deal A vote on different customs options, including a government proposal for a temporary customs union for goods - what Mrs May called a ""customs compromise"" A legal obligation for the UK to ""seek to conclude alternative arrangements"" to replace the Northern Ireland backstop by the end of 2020 If the backstop does come into force, the bill would guarantee Northern Ireland remains aligned with the rest of the UK and remains in same customs territory Legislation to ensure workers rights are ""every bit as good, if not better"" after Brexit - and guarantees of no dilution in environmental standards A legal duty to seek changes to the political declaration on future relations with the EU Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser 'Like Armageddon': Five fires rage in Los Angeles, with whole communities destroyed What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

It included a number of concessions designed to attract cross-party support, including new guarantees on workers' rights, environmental protections and the Northern Irish border, as well a customs ""compromise"". Latest: Reaction to PM's Brexit ""compromise"" offer No 10 plans to stand firm as PM's future unclear But Brexiteers in her own party reacted angrily to it, particularly a promise to give MPs a vote on another referendum if they backed the bill. Mrs May insists it is Parliament's ""last chance"" to get Brexit done. Several cabinet ministers broke cover on Wednesday afternoon to signal their unhappiness with the bill, among them Home Secretary Sajid Javid. Allow Twitter content?

Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt also requested a private meeting with the PM. But Laura Kuenssberg said the PM declined to meet the ministers - both of whom are seen as possible contenders to be the next Conservative leader - and instead seemed determined to ""tough it out"". Sources told the BBC the chief whip, Julian Smith, made it clear to backbench MPs that the prime minister was not resigning. The 1922 Committee had been expected to vote on Wednesday evening on whether to change the party's rules to allow an immediate vote of no confidence in the prime minister. Current rules dictate that as the PM survived such a vote in December, she cannot face another one for 12 months. However, the vote on a rule change did not take place - and afterwards, some members expressed their discontent. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The PM has already pledged to set a timetable for a new leader to take over after MPs vote on the Withdrawal Agreement Bill - in theory, on 7 June. But calls for her to go sooner than that have begun to come from Conservatives who had, until now, stayed loyal. PM under fire over new Brexit plan Is May's 'new' Brexit deal actually new? Writing in the Financial Times,external, Tom Tugendhat said: ""Leadership matters; it has been absent for too long,"" he said. ""This can only change with a new prime minister."" Former minister Tim Loughton said it was ""very sad"", but it was time for her to go - another, Stephen Crabb, said there needs to be a new PM ""within weeks"". More familiar critics also added to the clamour for her resignation. Leading Brexiteer Steve Baker said it was ""not personal"" but about ""the future of the country"", and his party ""needs to reassemble a governing coalition willing to take us out of the EU"", under a new leader. There have been doubts about Theresa May's leadership for many months. She herself has more or less said she will resign next month. But something different has happened today, the mood has really changed. More and more Conservatives publicly are saying she has to quit as soon as possible. Ministers have been saying to me privately she has now reached the end of line. Number 10 is adamant, though, that nothing has really changed she will press on and still try and get her Brexit deal though. But it feels the government is almost in breakdown. And it's simply not clear at this moment they'll really be able to hang on. The UK was meant to leave the EU on 29 March, but that has been pushed back to 31 October after the Commons rejected Mrs May's withdrawal deal with Brussels three times. Attempts to find a cross-party compromise via formal talks broke down last week, and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has rejected Mrs May's attempts to win his MPs over with her Brexit withdrawal bill plan. Mr Corbyn said her ""bold new deal"" was really a ""repackaged version"" of her failed withdrawal agreement, adding: ""No Labour MP can vote for a deal with the promise of a prime minister who only has days left in her job."" He said the issue of Brexit had been ""dividing our society and poisoning our democracy"", but claimed Mrs May's deal ""does not represent a genuine compromise"". Addressing her critics in the Commons earlier, Mrs May said: ""In time, another prime minister will be standing at this despatch box, but while I am here, I have a duty to be clear with the House about the facts. ""If we are going to deliver Brexit in this Parliament, we have to pass a Withdrawal Agreement Bill, and we will not do so without holding votes on the issues that have divided us the most,"" she said. ""In the end, our job in the House is to take decisions, not duck them."" The SNP's leader in Westminster Ian Blackford - who supports a further referendum to remain in the EU - said it was time for the prime minister to go, having ""lost the trust of the public"". ""This deal is dead,"" he added. The DUP, which props up Mrs May's government, has also refused the vote for the bill. Labour's Liz Kendall backed the call for a public vote, telling Mrs May she will not get enough support for her bill from opposition members without including a confirmatory ballot as part of the deal - rather than just offering a vote on whether to have one. But Conservative MP Vicky Ford said: ""We cannot continue to leave our country in this uncertainty. It has to stop. The whole House has to stop saying no to everything on the table just because it is not our favourite dish. ""If we vote for this bill we can move on and the discussion on the next stage can start."" This video can not be played Theresa May says failure to back her deal risks ""no Brexit at all"" Mrs May is bringing the Withdrawal Agreement Bill - legislation required to bring her agreement into UK law - to Parliament in early June. In an attempt to win over MPs across the House, she announced the following concessions: A guarantee of a Commons vote on whether to hold another referendum on the government's Brexit deal A vote on different customs options, including a government proposal for a temporary customs union for goods - what Mrs May called a ""customs compromise"" A legal obligation for the UK to ""seek to conclude alternative arrangements"" to replace the Northern Ireland backstop by the end of 2020 If the backstop does come into force, the bill would guarantee Northern Ireland remains aligned with the rest of the UK and remains in same customs territory Legislation to ensure workers rights are ""every bit as good, if not better"" after Brexit - and guarantees of no dilution in environmental standards A legal duty to seek changes to the political declaration on future relations with the EU Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser 'Like Armageddon': Five fires rage in Los Angeles, with whole communities destroyed What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

"Topshop tycoon Sir Philip Green plans to close 23 stores, putting 520 jobs under threat, as part of a rescue plan. Under the proposal, Burton, Dorothy Perkins and Topshop stores will close and rents will be cut at another 194 stores at the Arcadia group. However, the pensions regulator has doubts that the deal will ""adequately protect"" the pensions of employees. The regulator's support is crucial in order for a Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA) to be approved. CVAs are a type of insolvency for troubled businesses that allows rents to be cut. There are seven in total and all must be approved by creditors. The proposal states that Arcadia Group is prepared to put an additional Â£100m into the scheme over a number of years to bridge a shortfall in pension contributions, but the regulator does not think the plans are sufficient. Ian Grabiner, chief executive of Arcadia Group, called the steps ""tough but necessary"" to mend the business. The company also plans to shut all its 11 Topshop and Topman stores in the US. Philip Green: what's gone wrong at his Topshop empire? Sir Philip Green's Arcadia Group seeks to to cut costs US investor sells Topshop shares back to Sir Philip Green The closures would add to the 200 UK stores shut over the past three years as it struggles with a challenging market. They are seen as a final effort by a company to stave off administration or breakup. Many retail experts believe Topshop, Sir Philip's prize asset, has fallen out of favour with today's young consumers, who are favouring online retailers such as Asos and Pretty Little Thing. It is another blow to the tycoon, who this month lost his Sunday Times Rich List billionaire status. In return for the rent cuts, Sir Philip's wife, Lady Tina Green, who is the main shareholder of Arcadia, will invest Â£50m in the company. Landlords, thought to number in the hundreds, and other creditors will have to agree to the proposal, which will be put to them on 5 June. The deal will see them owning 20% of the firm, while they will also be able to claim against a Â£40m ""compromised creditor"" fund. It has not been made clear just how steep a rent reduction they are being asked to provide. Sir Philip's Arcadia group has 1,170 shops in 36 countries, although the majority are concessions or franchises. It has 566 locations in the UK and Ireland, employing 18,000 people. The plan must also be approved by the company's pension trustees, who are also being offered a new deal. The company has been topping up the two largest Arcadia pension schemes by Â£50m a year. This will be cut to Â£25m, but Lady Tina will make up the shortfall for three years and add another payment of Â£25m. Sir Philip's US stores were opened with great fanfare Sir Philip Green's brands used to dominate the High Street. He was the king of retail, making a fortune in the process. He famously took out a Â£1.2bn dividend from Arcadia back in 2005, the largest corporate payout in UK history. But this once powerful retail empire is now in serious trouble. Dorothy Perkins, Burtons and Miss Selfridge fell out of fashion a long time ago. Topshop has long been the jewel in the Arcadia crown but it too is struggling. It's no longer the go-to place for young fashion-seekers. Behind the scenes, his brands have suffered from years of underinvestment. But, like other traditional retailers, Arcadia is also been hit by rising costs like business rates and wages as well as our changing shopping habits. Sales are on the slide. This restructuring deal, which must be approved by landlords and the Pension Protection Fund, is a pivotal moment for Sir Philip and his business. If he doesn't succeed, administration looms. His aim is to put the group on a more sustainable footing so a turnaround plan can be put in place. But launching a CVA, even though they're in fashion, is a dramatic fall from grace for a businessman whose glory days seem long gone. Last year, landlords called for a government review as more struggling retailers asked for rent reductions. The British Property Federation (BPF) said too many companies were abusing CVAs and using them to dodge rent. The BPF said that it would be for individual property owners to decide on how they would vote on Arcadia's plan. New Look, Carpetright, House of Fraser and Mothercare are among retailers that used the process to shore up their finances. Last year, Sir Philip was embroiled in claims, which he strongly denied, of bullying and inappropriate behaviour. He was also criticised over the demise of department store chain BHS, which, after he sold it for just Â£1, collapsed a year later. It emerged in January that the business had hired advisers at Deloitte to explore a restructuring, prompted by a decline in sales and profits. What's gone wrong at Green's Topshop empire?

"In Spring 2016, Tata Steel's loss-making Long Products division, based at the steelworks which dominates Scunthorpe, was on its knees. The news that private equity group Greybull Capital would buy it for a token Â£1 was hailed as a new dawn. The deal came with a promise to invest Â£400m in the business, with the new owners also reviving the British Steel brand name. Then-Business Secretary Sajid Javid said he believed ""there really is a viable, sustainable future for world-class steelmaking in this country"". In 2017 and 2018 Greybull returned British Steel to profit. Three years on from its supposed rebirth, the company has collapsed into liquidation. Under Greybull, British Steel's ultimate parent company is Jersey-based Olympus Steel Limited. In British Steel's most recent accounts filed in May 2018, director Gerald Reichmann writes that the company has access to ""considerable financial resources"", although these are not quantified. The accounts show Olympus has lent British Steel Â£154m in the form of a secured loan. They also reveal that nearly Â£17m in interest on loans was charged by the parent company each year in 2017 and 2018. Greybull says that this interest has been accrued but not paid out in order to support the steel business through its turnaround and that all the company's profits have been ploughed back into the business. Greybull charged British Steel Â£3m in ""management fees"" in 2017 and again in 2018. The company says that those fees are 80% lower than those charged by British Steel's previous owner, Tata. Greybull Capital is a private - and secretive - equity partnership which invests in failing companies and tries to turn them around. It was set up in 2010, managed by French-born brothers Nathaniel and Marc Meyohas, along with Richard Perlhagen. They were later joined by Daniel Goldstein. He now runs the investment company with Marc Meyohas. Nathaniel Meyohas and Mr Perlhagen  have both subsequently left the firm. Greybull describes itself on its website as ""an entrepreneurial investment group, passionate about making companies successful"". Its purchase of Tata's loss-making division has been one of its highest profile deals in the UK. However, the firm also presided over Britain's biggest airline bankruptcy. It bought a majority stake in Monarch Airlines in 2014, with an investment of Â£125m. But the airline failed in October 2017, triggering what was described as the UK's biggest ever peacetime repatriation of stranded holidaymakers. Hundreds of people arrived at UK airports to find their flights cancelled. Nearly 1,900 staff lost their jobs. The cost to the taxpayer of repatriating about 110,000 stranded travellers,externalhas been estimated at Â£40.5m. The airline blamed the collapse on the threat of terror and other economic conditions. Greybull's website says that its rescue kept the airline flying for three years longer than if it had not stepped in and provided more than 2,700 people with work. Greybull subsequently took over Monarch's airline engineering arm in October 2018, but that went bust in January. Hundreds of jobs were then lost. In September 2015, Greybull bought the My Local convenience chain of 120 stores from supermarket chain Morrisons. But the business - which employed 1,650 people - fell into administration in June 2016. Greybull has also backed electrical retailer Comet and Riley's snooker halls. Both ended up collapsing. However, the firm has also had notable successes. In 2013, Greybull bought Metalrax, a specialist in non-stick coated steel for the bakeware industry, out of administration. It was renamed Arc Specialist Engineering, which was bought by its management team and investors in 2017. It also owns Plessey, another name from Britain's industrial past, and is seeking to turn it into a leader in LED technology. Former City minister Lord Myners has questioned Greybull's stewardship of the companies it has operated. ""Greybull has a record of owning businesses which fail, but where apparently Greybull does not lose serious money,"" he told the BBC. ""In fact, from a number of its failed investments, it's made money"". Greybull insists that it is in the ""business of turning around failing companies and that includes significant risk"".

"This video can not be played Undercover BBC filming shows staff swearing, mocking and taunting patients with autism and learning disabilities Eight years ago I worked with a team at BBC One's Panorama programme to reveal terrible physical abuse at a hospital for vulnerable adults on the outskirts of Bristol, called Winterbourne View. People with learning disabilities or autism were filmed by our undercover reporter being kicked, punched, mocked and mistreated by people paid to care for them. As the producer of that film, I worked with whistleblowers to gather evidence, hired the undercover reporter and oversaw his filming. Nearly a dozen people who had worked at Winterbourne View were prosecuted afterwards as a result of our evidence. The abuse was terrible, as was the betrayal of trust. After our film was broadcast, the then Prime Minister David Cameron, the then minister for care, Norman Lamb, and the Conservatives, Labour and the Liberal Democrats committed to shutting specialist hospitals and moving people closer to their families. That should have been the moment that the lives of thousands of people with learning disabilities or autism, whose behaviour some services struggle with, changed forever. Instead, though, we have been told that the political promise has been first watered down and then broken. Nearly 2,300 people with learning disabilities or autism are still in such hospitals, often far from home and for much longer than is appropriate. Hospitals are not places where people should live - and yet today they still are. Hospital 'abused' vulnerable adults Last year, a series of new whistleblowers approached BBC Panorama, complaining about the culture, attitude and behaviour of a group of care workers at a different hospital for vulnerable adults, called Whorlton Hall in County Durham. They told us that care workers were bullying and mistreating patients. That sort of behaviour should never happen in any hospital, and certainly not after all the promises that were made after Winterbourne View. Worse, eight years ago Whorlton Hall, which is privately-run but NHS-funded, had been owned by the same company as Winterbourne View. One of the families affected by Winterbourne View told us they were shocked a hospital which used to be part of the same group could also be abusive. Olivia Davies went undercover to investigate the allegations I contacted a talented young journalist named Olivia Davies who had already been undercover twice for the BBC. I asked if she would be prepared to work inside the hospital as a care worker while also, at the same time, gathering evidence for the BBC. Olivia agreed and worked 12-hour shifts, often back to back, over more than two months, wearing a camera hidden in her top. The patients whose care - and too often neglect or cruelty - that Olivia documented are some of the most vulnerable but also challenging people in the country. Olivia loved spending time with the patients, but that made her unusual among the staff at Whorlton Hall, most of whom seemed to ignore the people they are paid to care for. Too many care workers actively aggravated, tormented and talked about patients in the most appalling ways. The taunting and deliberate winding up of patients was almost unbearable to witness, as was the language and attitude. Experts who reviewed our footage said that in one case what Olivia had filmed was evidence of psychological torture. Another patient was frequently deliberately provoked by staff. Olivia witnessed patients being physically restrained. Something that should only be a last resort is used too often and NHS figures show that its use is increasing. The practice of holding distressed people down, often on the floor and sometimes for long periods of time, is horrible to witness and even worse to endure. It shouldn't have happened again. The government should have fixed these issues, eight years ago. We asked Health Secretary Matt Hancock for an interview about the wider issues, but his press office told us: ""We treat any allegations of abuse with the utmost seriousness. ""Durham Constabulary are now leading a criminal investigation into the allegations and we cannot comment on the investigation while it is ongoing. Steps have been taken to ensure the safety of residents at Whorlton Hall. ""Autistic people and those with learning disabilities should receive the best possible care and be supported to live in their communities. ""We are working to ensure more people return home from hospital as soon as their treatment has finished and significant investment in community support has already led to a 22% reduction in these mental health inpatient numbers since 2015."" Cygnet, the company which now owns Whorlton Hall, said: ""We are shocked and deeply saddened by the allegations made against members of staff at Whorlton Hall, part of the Danshell Group, which Cygnet recently acquired. ""We take these allegations extremely seriously.  We have suspended all the members of staff involved, simultaneously informed all relevant authorities, including the police, who have now instigated an inquiry and we are co-operating fully with their investigation. ""We have taken the initiative of transferring all the patients to other hospitals. ""The safety and care of our patients and residents is of paramount importance and we have zero tolerance of unprofessional conduct towards them. ""Those implicated in this programme have betrayed not only some of society's most vulnerable people but also the thousands of people at Cygnet who work daily with dedication and compassion to look after the people in their care. ""This appalling behaviour is entirely inconsistent with Cygnet Health Care's values and high standards and we remain absolutely committed to delivering the highest quality healthcare, which our patients and residents expect and deserve.""

"The government has decided not to provide extra money to British Steel,which is to enter insolvency. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn had called on Theresa May to take a public stake in the company, having previously said that Brexit could be an opportunity to pump more cash into British industry. He said that European Union (EU) rules restricted so-called ""state aid"", so Brexit could make it easier for the British government to support the British steel industry. But other EU member states, such as France and Germany, spend far more than the UK on state aid despite also signing up to the same single market rules, so are they really an obstacle? And leaving the EU may not mean an end to these rules. Other state-aid restrictions would be likely to apply to post-Brexit Britain, such as World Trade Organization rules and the terms of any future trade deal with the EU. State aid is financial assistance given by the government to companies or other organisations that has the potential to distort market competition. The aid can be in the form of direct cash grants or indirect aid - such as preferential borrowing rates or tax credits. Under EU rules, member-state governments are allowed to provide state aid only with approval from the European Commission. For example, in 2015 the UK government submitted plans to provide a subsidy to Drax power station to convert one of its units from coal to biomass fuel. Following an investigation, the commission ruled in favour of the scheme. There are exceptions to the rules. For example, governments can provide aid for broadband infrastructure without prior approval. And aid worth less than 200,000 euros (Â£175,000) over three years is exempt. The EU Commission says too much steel is produced in Europe. As a result, it has been inclined to take a fairly tough line on state aid in this sector. In 2016 for example, the commission ordered Belgium to recover 211m euros in illegal state aid it had given to its steel industry. That does not mean all state aid is impossible, but the government would have to make a case that assistance was within the rules, or fell under one of the exemptions. One possibility would be to argue that the steel industry was essential for national security, but it is far from clear the commission would accept that. If the UK left the EU single market, it would no longer formally be bound by the EU's state-aid rules. However, the EU is concerned the UK could use Brexit as an opportunity to undermine the single market, by giving its companies an unfair advantage. Thepolitical declaration,externalon the future relationship between the UK and the EU says it must ""ensure open and fair competition"" and that should include provisions to cover state aid - but Theresa May has repeatedly failed to get this through Parliament. In her Florence speech, in 2017, she said the UK and EU agree ""trying to beat other countries' industries by unfairly subsidising one's own is a serious mistake"". Aside from what is agreed with the EU, after Brexit, Britain will still belong to the World Trade Organization, which also has state-aid rules: members can impose tariffs - taxes on imports - on countries that excessively subsidise domestic industry. The EU measures,externalhow much money countries spend on state aid, as a proportion of their economy. The UK ranks very low down, spending just 0.38% of its gross domestic product - the total value of all good and services produced. This is far lower than Germany (1.31%), France (0.76%) and Poland (1.59%). Therefore, it seems likely that EU single market rules are not the only thing limiting state aid. The Labour leader said the government should have decided it wanted to own British Steel and nationalised it - but that is also tricky under EU rules. A government can own a company under state-aid rules - but it is not allowed to keep it going if it would otherwise fail. So if a government could convince the European Commission that buying the business would be a sensible move that any investor would make for a profit, it would not be classified as state aid. That might have been a difficult argument to make with British Steel. What claims do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

"British Steel - the Scunthorpe steelworks with a brand name revived by private investors Greybull - says it needs Â£75m of government support to avoid collapse. Business Secretary Greg Clark faces three choices in weighing up whether to intervene: hand over Â£75m of taxpayer's money to a private company with a chequered track record that bought the Scunthorpe works for a Â£1 nationalise it allow British Steel to go bust with the loss of 4,000 direct jobs and 20,000 more at risk in the supply chain What are the implications of each of these options? The government has already lent this company Â£120m so why not round it up to Â£200m to keep the company going? Well, the first Â£120m was in the form of a bridging loan - a bridge to a world in which a Brexit deal has been agreed and the company can then receive the back-dated carbon credits that have been withheld pending Brexit uncertainty and settle its Â£120m carbon emissions bill with the EU. That would allow British Steel to give the government its Â£120m back. If the withdrawal agreement had already been passed, the UK would now be in transition/implementation phase, life would be as it was before, and British Steel wouldn't have needed the Â£120m in the first place. The extra Â£75m is different. This is a straight lifeline to a company that is struggling in the market place and needs extra operating cash to pay wages and keep the furnaces warm. This is the sort of thing the government refused to do foroutsourcing companies Carillionand Interserve as it offends Tory principles to prop up failing businesses. As former Permanent Secretary to the Treasury, Lord (Nick) McPherson replied to me on Twitter: It would be ""Further evidence that industrial policy has lurched back to the failed interventionism of the 1970s. If British Steel can't compete at this exchange rate, you have to ask whether it ever will. #badbusiness."" Given steel market conditions, some have said it would amount to shovelling taxpayer money straight into a furnace. On the very day Labour announced its plans to nationalise the energy sector - to howls of protest by the energy companies and the condemnation of right-leaning free marketeers - this ultimate form of state intervention would be a difficult political manoeuvre. It would look like handing the Labour Party the moral and political high ground by saying that only the state could save the jobs of workers from the clutches of private speculators who bought this business for Â£1. This would perhaps be the traditional Tory party tough love response. The state is not in the business of propping up failing businesses. The market decides which companies prosper and which do not - simples. Letting 4,000 jobs go, with another 20,000 in the supply chain, with elections next week? That could see Tory orthodoxy exact a heavy price at the European elections next week in which most expect them to get a drubbing anyway. There are other options such as temporary nationalisation to support a management buyout or add sweeteners to a prospective trade buyer. Where is the saviour of the UK steel industry Sanjeev Gupta when you need him? Mr Gupta has bought a string of ailing UK steel plants and nursed some back to health.  But he is thought to have been having problems of his own lately with many steel suppliers reporting that payment problems have caused them to ask for money up front for raw materials.

"British Steel has been placed in compulsory liquidation, putting 5,000 jobs at risk and endangering 20,000 in the supply chain. The move follows a breakdown in rescue talks between the government and the company's owner, Greybull. The Government's Official Receiver has taken control of the company as part of the liquidation process. The search for a buyer for British Steel has already begun. In the meantime, it will trade normally. The Official Receiver said British Steel Ltd had been wound up in the High Court and the immediate priority was to continue safe operation of the site. The company was transferred to the Official Receiver because British Steel, its shareholders and the government were not able to, or would not, support the business. That meant the company did not have to funds to pay for an administration. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn and Theresa May clashed over British Steel at PMQs The other companies within the British Steel group are continuing to trade as normal and are not in insolvency. British Steel failure: The role of Greybull What are the EU rules about state aid? The Official Receiver and EY are looking for a buyer for the business. If they fail to find one, the firm would be wound up and redundancies would follow. ""I appreciate that this is a difficult time for the company's employees and I want to thank them for their ongoing co-operation,"" Receiver David Chapman said. ""The company in liquidation is continuing to trade and supply its customers while I consider options for the business. British Steel has about 5,000 employees. There are 3,000 at Scunthorpe, with another 800 on Teesside and in north-eastern England. The rest are in France, the Netherlands and various sales offices round the world. Their wages this week have been paid by Greybull and the government will pick up the bill from now on. Roy Rickhuss, general secretary of the steelworkers' trade union, Community, said: ""This news will heap more worries on workers and everyone connected with British Steel, but it will also end the uncertainty under Greybull's ownership and must be seized as an opportunity to look for an alternative future. ""It is vital now that cool heads prevail and all parties focus on saving the jobs. Kevin Prior, pictured with his partner Kayleigh Manderson, said rumours about the plant had been ""circulating for weeks"" Staff in Scunthorpe havealso reacted. ""Everyone is terrified,"" said steelworker Kevin Prior. The 32-year-old scrap metal cutter has been at the plant since 2015 and his sister and brother-in-law also work at there. He said rumours about the company's future had been circulating for a number of weeks. ""It's just heartbreaking,"" he said. ""It's horrible to hear that my sister is crying herself to sleep because she doesn't know what's going to happen with her husband's job and what that means for them."" As well as the plant's workers the North Lincolnshire town's economy relies heavily on the giant steel works, with an estimated 20,000 jobs linked to the site. Its closure would be a body blow, with some residents claiming it would leave Scunthorpe a ""ghost town"". In 2007, India's Tata conglomerate entered the UK steel market after it bought the Anglo Dutch group, Corus. In 2010, the business was renamed Tata Steel Europe. After a difficult few years, during depths of the 2016 steel crisis, Tata sold the Scunthorpe long products division to private equity firm Greybull Capital for a nominal Â£1. Greybull rebranded the company as British Steel. British Steel's more recent troubles have been linked to a slump in orders from European customers âdue to uncertainty over the Brexit process. It has has also struggled with the weakness of the pound since the EU referendum in June 2016 and the escalating US-China trade war. In a statement on Wednesday, Greybull said: ""The turnaround of British Steel was always going to be a challenge, and yet the business overcame many difficulties and until recently, looked set for renewed prosperity. ""The workforce, the trade unions and the management team have worked closely together in their determination to strengthen the business. However, the additional blows dealt by Brexit-related issues have proven insurmountable."" The High Court appointed accountancy firm EY to the role of Special Manager, assisting the Receiver. EY said the appointment of the Official Receiver followed ""a number of weeks"" of negotiations by management with the company's various stakeholders, including lenders, shareholders and the government, to secure the necessary funding to avoid an insolvency. ""Regrettably, these efforts were unable to secure a solution before the company's funding resources were exhausted."" British Steel customer Network Rail sources 95% of its rails from British Steel's Scunthorpe plant. In a statement, the rail infrastructure operator said it had been working closely with British Steel and the government for ""many weeks"". ""We have done what we can to help ease the company's financial difficulties. We have improved our order book with the company - increasing rail production volumes, bringing orders forward and committing to a long term schedule - as well as offering immediate payment to ease the pressure on cash flow."" It is understood the company has enough stockpiles to keep it going until other suppliers can increase production. Business Secretary Greg Clark said the government had shown its ""willingness to act"", having provided the British Steel with a Â£120m bridging loan in April to meet EU emission rules and avoid a steep fine. However, he added: ""The government can only act within the law, which requires any financial support to a steel company to be on a commercial basis. I have been advised that it would be unlawful to provide a guarantee or loan on the terms of any proposals that the company or any other party has made."" Labour's shadow business secretary, Rebecca Long Bailey, called for the company to be nationalised. She said: ""The government must act quickly to save this strategically important industry and the livelihoods and communities of those who work in it, by bringing British Steel into public ownership.''

"Nicola Sturgeon faces questions during FMQs Ruth Davidson raises indyref2, Richard Leonard calls for more renewables jobs and Alison Johnstone asks about cycling Others ask about tech jobs, active travel and ATM charges Earlier the rural economy committee took evidence on the workplace parking levy Craig Hutchison and Louise Wilson That's all from Holyrood Live this week! Local politicians will need to be ""very brave"" and have ""vision"" to introduce a workplace parking tax, MSPs have heard. The Scottish government has pledged to support a Green proposal to give councils the power to levy a charge on parking spaces to reduce congestion. Witnesses from Nottingham, the only council in the UK with a scheme of this sort, spoke positively of its impact. But they told MSPs that it was ""not easy"", saying that ""strong political leadership"" was ""absolutely essential"". However, one SNP committee member, Richard Lyle, spoke out repeatedly against the levy during the meeting, saying it was ""an unfair tax on myself and other people as a motorist"", Culture Secretary Fiona Hyslop Culture Secretary Fiona Hyslop says local radio plays a valuable role in Scotland's culture. ""More Scots listen to commercial radio than BBC stations,"" she adds. The Scottish government is disappointed with Ofcom's decision to permit a reduction in local radio programming in Scotland says Ms Hyslop. The culture secretary is also disappointed at the failure to maintain a distinct character between east and west in Scotland. She argues through these decisions Ofcom has opened the door to change but not change we welcome. Ofcom,externalapologised to MSPs for not notifying the Scottish Parliament of its consultation on changes to the regulations for local radio. The broadcasting watchdog wasgiving evidence to the culture committee last week (refresh this link a couple of times). Committee convener Joan McAlpine argued latest change from Ofcom will make commercial radio even less local. Ms McAlpine also asked about thelocalness consultation undertaken by Ofcom,external, where a majority of the respondents were against the proposals, with only the big players like Bauer backing it. Neil Stock from Ofcom explained the responses to the consultation were only one of the pieces of evidence that was considered, citing research the organisation undertook. The committee alsoheard from Bauer and DC Thomson (Refresh this link a couple of times). Capital FM are replacing Scotland's breakfast show with Capital London's breakfast show The latest review of Ofcom's guidance for local radio has meant fewer locally-produced programmes have to be aired. FM stations which provide at least hourly peak-time local news now only have to have six hours of local programmes between 6am and 7pm, down from 10 hours under the previous guidelines. And those which provide local news hourly any time between 6am and 7pm only need to have three hours, down from seven. Ofcom said the alterations were due to changes in competition and listening habits across the radio sector. Global media has announced it will launch UK-wide national breakfast shows on Capital, Heart and Smooth radio. Global say they will be creating the three largest commercial radio breakfast shows in the UK, with 4.8m, 3.7m and 2.7m listeners respectively each week. But it means a reduction in locally produced programmes, with more than 100 jobs at risk due to the changes. Ofcom has approved the move following achange in guidelines,externalfor local radio. Vick Hope and Roman Kemp present Capital breakfast in London, while until recently Jamie Theakston co-hosted Heart breakfast with Emma Bunton What does this mean for Scotland? Read more here. SNP MSP George Adam expresses concern that Ofcom is ""attacking Scottish commercial radio"" by creating a duopoly between Global and Bauer radio using local radio licences. Doing this means local news, local music and local presenters are squeezed he warns. Mr Adam says many of the biggest operators run the local multiplex and essentially set the cost for other stations wanting to use that multiplex. Only one FM licence has been given out by Ofcom in the past ten years, he highlights, which means some stations cannot expand. We have to make sure we still have our voice on radio, he concludes. SNP MSP George Adam leads a member's debate expressing concern about changes to commercial local radio. Mr Adam says OFCOM's changes put pressure on local radio station content and news and its remit has been questions. He's calling for a review of the changes to local radio regulation.

SNP MSP Bob Doris says he is seeking a meeting with the payment systems regulator to call for charges to be eliminated. The first minister highlights that Digital Economy Minister Kate Forbes met with the regulator in December and urges it to use its powers on this. SNP MSP John Mason asks if the first minister agrees that it is even worse when the ATM is removed altogether. The first minister replies there is an ongoing dialogue with banks and she adds she will continue to press the UK government to do the same. Tory MSP Dean Lockhart asks why Scotland is the only part of the UK that has business rates on post office ATMs Ms Sturgeon explains this issue has been raised by the post offices and adds she has undertaken to look into it. The first minister says the ability to freely access cash is vital, especially for small businesses and vulnerable communities. She says the government is calling for a regulator solely responsible for cash infrastructure. Ms McNeill says 2.75 million people rely wholly on cash and warns about the impact ATM charges will have on the poorest communities. I am happy to cooperate on a cross party basis on this issue, replies the first minister, and highlights support for the Which? campaign on this.  Allow Twitter content?

Free-to-use cash machines have been disappearing at a rapid rate across the UK, according to a study by Which? Nearly 1,700 machines started charging for withdrawals in the first three months of the year, with the majority starting to charge in March, according to the consumer lobby group. Cardtronics, which runs most of those, and fellow provider NoteMachine are both likely to charge at more machines. That could mean the country losing 13% of its free ATMs in only a few months. The changes come aftera reduction in the fee operators receive from banks each time an ATM is used. Read more here. Labour MSP Pauline McNeill ask what the Scottish government's response is to reports that
around one in five of Scotland's free-to-use ATMs are expected to
introduce charges to customers in the next 12 months The first minister says the Scottish government doubled the active travel budget. Ms Hamilton says this is Walk to School Week but less than half of pupils do so. The Tory MSP asks for air quality monitors to be considered. We will continue to take action to improve air quality replies the first minister. Ms Sturgeon says that is not helped by knee jerk opposition to policies like the Workplace Parking Levy. According to Transport Scotland: The Scottish government doubled the already record level of investment in walking and cycling from Â£39.2 million in 2017-18 to Â£80 million per year in 2018-19. Much of this budget is allocated to its active travel delivery partners who work across Scotland to deliver projects that will get more people walking and cycling for shorter everyday journeys. They in turn distribute much of this funding to local authorities, community groups, third sector groups and others. View Transport Scotland's budget allocation breakdown,externalfor full details. Tory MSP Rachael Hamilton asks what action the Scottish government is taking to promote
active travel. Tory MSP Jamie Halcro Johnstone asks why financial service apprenticeships are not more widely available. Ms Sturgeon says there is a lot of work going on to build the skills base. She says the biggest concern about the recruitment of skills is the ending of the freedom of movement, however, saying the system of migration must allow us to attract people from abroad. Ms Sturgeon warmly welcomes the announcement. Mr Macdonald asks how the first minister will seek to capitalise on this and get more jobs for Edinburgh. There's no doubt Brexit is a severe threat to jobs replies the fist minister. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Huawei unveiled new phones powered by ARM-based chips, on Tuesday UK-based chip designer ARM has told staff it must suspend business with Huawei, according to internal documents obtained by the BBC. ARM instructed employees to halt ""all active contracts, support entitlements, and any pending engagementsâ with Huawei and its subsidiaries to comply with a recent US trade clampdown. ARM's designs form the basis of most mobile device processors worldwide. In a company memo, it said its designs contained âUS origin technologyâ. As a consequence, it believes it is affected by the Trump administration's ban. One analyst described the move, if it became long-term, as an âinsurmountableâ blow to Huaweiâs business. He said it would greatly affect the firm's ability to develop its own chips, many of which are currently built with ARMâs underlying technology, for which it pays a licence. These are used in the Chinese company's 5G base stations and computer servers in addition to its smartphones. Cambridge-headquartered ARM had been described as the UK's largest tech firm until its takeover by a Japanese fund. It employs 6,000 workersand lists eight offices in the US,external. In a statement on Wednesday it said: ""ARM is complying with the latest restrictions set forth by the US government and is having ongoing conversations with the appropriate US government agencies to ensure we remain compliant. ""ARM values its relationship with our long-time partner HiSilicon and we are hopeful for a swift resolution on this matter."" Huawei has issued a brief statement of its own. ""We value our close relationships with our partners, but recognise the pressure some of them are under, as a result of politically motivated decisions,"" it said. ""We are confident this regrettable situation can be resolved and our priority remains to continue to deliver world-class technology and products to our customers around the world."" ARM is a chip designer founded in 1990. In September 2016 it was acquired by Japanese telecoms giant Softbank, but remains based in Cambridge, UK. ARM does not manufacture computer processors itself, but rather licenses its semiconductor technologies to others. In some cases, manufacturers only license ARM's architecture, or ""instruction sets"", which determine how processors handle commands. This option gives chip-makers greater freedom to customise their own designs. In other cases, manufacturers license ARM's processor core designs - which describes how the chips' transistors should be arranged. These blueprints still need to be combined with other elements - such as memory and radios - to create what is referred to as a system-on-chip. As a result, when you hear talk of a device being powered by a Samsung Exynos, Qualcomm Snapdragon or Apple A11 chip - or one in a Huawei smartphone - it is still ARM's technology that is involved. ARM's US headquarters are in San Jose, California, and the firm has offices in Washington, Arizona, Texas and Massachusetts. Read more: What is ARM and why was it worth $24bn? ARMâs staff were informed of the decision on 16 May, following the US Commerce Departmentâs move to add Huawei to its âentity listâ of companies with which American firms could no longer do business. The BBC has also seen a company memo dated 18 May detailing the implications of the export ban. Huawei's microchip vulnerability explained Huawei's Android loss: How it affects you Huawei's use of Android restricted by Google On Monday 20 May, US government officialsissued a 90-day reprieve,externalon some of the restrictions in order to minimise immediate disruption. But ARM believes that the temporary licence involved does not apply to it. A spokesman for ARM declined to offer any additional clarity about the current status of its Huawei contracts. A break with ARM would make it difficult for Huawei to develop future generations of its Kirin processors According to one memo, ARM staff were instructed to suspend all interactions with Huawei and its subsidiaries. It advised staff to send a note informing Huawei (or related) employees that due to an âunfortunate situationâ, they were not allowed to âprovide support, delivery technology (whether software, code, or other updates), engage in technical discussions, or otherwise discuss technical matters with Huawei, HiSilicon or any of the other named entitiesâ. ARM staff that come into contact with employees at industry events must âpolitely decline and stopâ any conversations about the business, the guidance said - stressing that individuals could be held personally liable for breaking the trade rules. The ban also appeared to apply to ARM China, the China-based company in which ARM Holdings owns a 49% stake. It was set up as a joint venture with a Chinese investment consortium last year in order to enable ARM to develop, sell and offer support for its products in the region. Huawei told reporters on Tuesday that its âplan Bâ for software would be to develop its own operating system, something it has already been working on for some time. However, it will be significantly more difficult for the firm to source home-grown components of sufficient quality. Huawei currently sources some of its chips from HiSilicon, which it owns. However, while produced in China, HiSiliconâs chips are built using underlying technology created by ARM. While HiSilicon and Huawei are free to carry on using and manufacturing existing chips, the ban would mean the company could no longer turn to ARM for assistance in developing components for devices in future. HiSilicon's upcoming processor, Kirin 985, is due be used in Huawei devices later this year. According to a source at ARM, it is not expected to be affected by the ban. However, the next iteration of the chip has not yet been completed - and is likely to need to be rebuilt from scratch, the source said. Huawei also uses ARM's designs for its recently unveiled Kunpeng chips. These are used to power its TaiShan-series computer servers,which are designed to provide cloud computing and storage to clients,external. In addition, the company told analysts in January that the Tiangang chip at the heart of its 5G base stations is also ARM-based. Huawei's carrier division chief Ryan Ding showed off its 5G base station chip alongside an image saying it involved a ""high-performance ARM-based processor"" ""The problem of the whole telecoms industry is that so much of it is based on the exchange of technology between different companies - whether that's chip companies, software providers or the makers of other hardware,"" commented Alan Burkitt-Gray, editor-at-large of the telecoms news site Capacity Media. He added that Huawei would likely face other problems licensing 5G-related tech from others, and in turn US-based companies would now be unable to licence the Chinese company's 5G inventions. ""This will carve out a chasm in the industry between Huawei-originated intellectual property and the rest of the world's,"" he said. ""It's just a total mess and it's happened at a critical time for the rollout of 5G."" The relationship between ARM and Huawei engineers is tight - earlier this month Huawei announced its intention to build a research centre only 15 minutes from ARMâs headquarters in Cambridge, UK. The latest development follows news that Huawei will lose access to some of Google's Android services ""ARM is the foundation of Huaweiâs smartphone chip designs, so this is an insurmountable obstacle for Huawei,â said Geoff Blaber, from CCS Insight. ""That said, with an abundance of companies in Huaweiâs supply chain already having taken action to comply with the US order, Huaweiâs ability to operate was already severely affected.â What is not yet clear is whether ARM is acting on its own interpretation of the US rules, or whether it has been advised by the Commerce Department. ""If that interpretation is correct, thatâs going to affect every semiconductor company in the world,â remarked analyst Lee Ratliff, from IHS Markit. ""Theyâre not going to be able to easily replace these parts with new, in-house designs - the semiconductor industry in China is nascent.â _______ Additional reporting by Leo Kelion Follow Dave Lee on Twitter@DaveLeeBBC,external Do you have more information about this or any other technology story?

Theresa May could meet the foreign secretary tomorrow In a sign of unrest at the highest levels of the Tory party, a series of cabinet ministers asked for meetings with Mrs May today to raise their concerns about the Withdrawal Agreement Bill. Downing Street sources told the Press Association it was possible that the PM could meet Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt on Thursday, but there was no confirmation that an audience would be granted for other ministers with reservations about the plan. Home Secretary Sajid Javid has asked for a meeting to discuss his concerns about the prospect of a second referendum, after Mrs May revealed she would grant MPs a vote on whether the Brexit deal should be put to the public. Theresa May has experienced more cabinet resignations than any prime minister since the beginning of Margaret Thatcher's reign - and in a much shorter time. With all of this drama in Westminster ongoing, it would be easy to forget about the little matter of the European elections.

"Some of the world's biggest footwear firms are urging Donald Trump to end the US trade war with China, warning of a ""catastrophic"" effect on consumers. A letter signed by 173 companies, including Nike and Adidas, says the president's decision to raise import tariffs will affect the working class. They also warn that higher levies threaten the future of some businesses. Mr Trump says that the trade deficit with China hurts the US economy. The US presidentincreased levies on $200bn (Â£157.3bn) worth of Chinese imports into the USfrom 10% to 25% more than a week ago after Washington and Beijing failed to reach a deal on trade. China retaliated by announcing plans to raise levies on $60bn of US imports from 1 June. US-China trade war: What could Beijing do next? Who loses out in the US-China trade war? US firms fear 'retaliation' against Huawei curbs The footwear companies that signed the letter,,externalincluding Clarks, Dr Martens and Converse, say that while the average US tariff on footwear is 11.3%, in some cases it can reach as high as 67.5%. ""Adding a 25% tax increase on top of these tariffs would mean some working American families could pay a nearly 100% duty on their shoes,"" the companies wrote. ""This is unfathomable."" ""It is time to bring this trade war to an end,"" the firms urged. When he raised tariffs earlier this month, Mr Trump told companies that they could reduce costs by shifting production to the US.

However, the shoemakers and retailers say that while they have been moving their sourcing away from China: ""Footwear is a very capital-intensive industry, with years of planning required to make sourcing decisions, and companies cannot simply move factories to adjust to these changes."" On Tuesday, a top business lobby in China released a survey of its members that found just over 40% had relocated, or were considering moving production facilities, outside of China because of tariffs. The survey by the American Chambers of Commerce in China and Shanghai found one-third of respondents had delayed or cancelled investment decisions to cope with tariffs. A recent escalation in the trade conflict - including tighter restrictions on Chinese telecoms giant Huawei - was creating fresh concerns for businesses in China, the group said. Huawei faces break with UK chip giant ARM Moving to Vietnam to avoid tariffs A quick guide to the US-China trade war Last week,the Trump administration added Huawei to its ""entity list"",external, which bans the company from acquiring technology from US firms without government approval. Speaking to the BBC, the chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce (AmCham) in China, Tim Stratford, said its members had ""real concerns"" about the fallout from the US action against Huawei. ""Particularly in the wake of the decision to put Huawei on the... entity list, there are concerns that the government of China may decide to retaliate against American companies,"" Mr Stratford said. This video can not be played Why the US-China trade war will hit most of our pockets A survey by AmCham found that slightly more than 40% of its members had relocated, or were considering moving, outside of China because of tariffs. The group represents more than 900 US companies working in China. Plane manufacturer Boeing, pharmaceuticals firm Pfizer and soft drink giant Coca-Cola are among the US companies AmCham represents in China. Last year, Boeing opened its first completion plant for its 737 passenger plane in eastern China, near the city of Shanghai. Boeing's president of China, John Bruns, said he was ""nervous"" about the ""challenging environment"" caused by the tit-for-tat tariff war. Trump's tariffs and protectionism explained China and the US have been engaged in a fractious dispute over trade since the early days of Mr Trump's presidency. While campaigning for the presidential election in 2016, Mr Trump repeatedly accused China of unfair trading practices and intellectual property theft. He threatened to apply tariffs, saying China's entry into the World Trade Organization had paved the way for the ""greatest jobs theft in history"". Coca-Cola is one of the US companies with a manufacturing base in China He also wants to cut America's trade deficit with China, which he says is hurting US manufacturing. Despite several rounds of talks, the world's two largest economies have failed to reach an agreement to end the trade war. Still, Beijing signalled some willingness to work with Washington to solve their trade dispute. No discussions have been scheduled since the last round of talks ended on 10 May. ""China remains ready to continue our talks with our American colleagues to reach a conclusion. Our door is still open,"" China's ambassador to the US Cui Tiankai said on Fox News. The leaders of the US and China are also set to meet again at the G20 summit in Japan next month.

"Prof Alston met people across the UK, including these Belfast residents The UK's social safety net has been ""deliberately removed and replaced with a harsh and uncaring ethos"", a report commissioned by the UN has said. Special rapporteur on extreme poverty Philip Alston said ""ideological"" cuts to public services since 2010 have led to ""tragic consequences"". The report comes afterProf Alston visited UK towns and cities and made preliminary findingslast November. The government said his final report was ""barely believable"". The Â£95bn spent on welfare and the maintenance of the state pension showed the government took tackling poverty ""extremely seriously"", a spokesman for the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) said. What do we mean when we talk about poverty? Income 'not the only factor' Prof Alston is an independent expert in human rights law and was appointed to the unpaid role by the UN Human Rights Council in June 2014. He spent nearly two weeks travelling in Britain and Northern Ireland and received more than 300 written submissions for his report. He concluded: ""The bottom line is that much of the glue that has held British society together since the Second World War has been deliberately removed and replaced with a harsh and uncaring ethos."" The Australian professor, who is based at New York University, said government policies had led to the ""systematic immiseration [economic impoverishment]"" of a significant part of the UK population, meaning they had continually put people further into poverty. 'Our school, the fourth emergency service' Inequality driving 'deaths of despair' Poverty 'tightens grip on poorest children' Some observers might conclude that the DWP had been tasked with ""designing a digital and sanitised version of the 19th Century workhouse, made infamous by Charles Dickens"", he said. The report citesindependent experts,externalsaying that 14 million people in the UK - a fifth of the population - live in poverty, according to a new measure that takes into account costs such as housing and childcare. In 2017,1.5 million people experienced destitution,external, meaning they had less than Â£10 a day after housing costs, or they had to go without at least two essentials such as shelter, food, heat, light, clothing or toiletries during a one-month period. Despite official denials, Prof Alston said he had heard accounts of people choosing between heating their homes or eating, children turning up to school with empty stomachs, increased homelessness and food bank use, and ""story after story"" of people who had considered or attempted suicide. People in Clacton shared their concerns at a meeting with the UN special rapporteur He said the cause was the government's ""ideological"" decision to dismantle the social safety net and focus on work as the solution to poverty. ""UK standards of well-being have descended precipitately in a remarkably short period of time, as a result of deliberate policy choices made when many other options were available,"" said Prof Alston. By Michael Buchanan, BBC social affairs correspondent To anyone familiar with the shifting landscape of Britain's poorest communities since 2010, there is nothing factually new in these findings. By highlighting them in one short, 20-page report, however, Philip Alston raises a fundamental question - is the government, and the country, comfortable with the society that we've become? He outlines the normalisation of food banks, rising levels of homelessness and child poverty, steep cuts to benefits and policing, and severe restrictions on legal aid. In Professor Alston's view, these are the unequivocal consequences of deliberate, calculated political decisions. Ministers have long argued they had no choice but to cut public spending. Whatever the motivation, life has become a lot harder in recent years for millions of people in the UK. The DWP said that the UN's own data putthe UK 15th on the list of the happiest places to live. ""This is a barely believable documentation of Britain, based on a tiny period of time spent here. It paints a completely inaccurate picture of our approach to tackling poverty,"" a spokesman said. ""All the evidence shows that full-time work is the best way to boost your income and quality of life,"" the spokesman added. Prof Alston praised the ""resilience, strength and generosity"" of British people, as well as the compassion of local officials and volunteers. Food bank supplies help record numbers The 20-year promise that proved impossible In-work poverty hits 2.9 million children And he said there had been some positive developments, with increases in the Universal Credit work allowances expected to lift 200,000 people out of poverty, and plans to introduce a consistent measure of poverty. But he said the ""massive disinvestment"" in the social safety net continued, making the changes seem like ""window dressing to minimise political fall-out"". Despite the government's focus on work and record levels of employment, about 60% of people in poverty are in families where someone works, Prof Alston said. He said this, along with welfare cuts, created a ""highly combustible situation that will have dire consequences"" in an extended economic downturn.

"Nicola Sturgeon faces questions during FMQs Ruth Davidson raises indyref2, Richard Leonard calls for more renewables jobs and Alison Johnstone asks about cycling Others ask about tech jobs, active travel and ATM charges Earlier the rural economy committee took evidence on the workplace parking levy Craig Hutchison and Louise Wilson That's all from Holyrood Live this week! Local politicians will need to be ""very brave"" and have ""vision"" to introduce a workplace parking tax, MSPs have heard. The Scottish government has pledged to support a Green proposal to give councils the power to levy a charge on parking spaces to reduce congestion. Witnesses from Nottingham, the only council in the UK with a scheme of this sort, spoke positively of its impact. But they told MSPs that it was ""not easy"", saying that ""strong political leadership"" was ""absolutely essential"". However, one SNP committee member, Richard Lyle, spoke out repeatedly against the levy during the meeting, saying it was ""an unfair tax on myself and other people as a motorist"", Culture Secretary Fiona Hyslop Culture Secretary Fiona Hyslop says local radio plays a valuable role in Scotland's culture. ""More Scots listen to commercial radio than BBC stations,"" she adds. The Scottish government is disappointed with Ofcom's decision to permit a reduction in local radio programming in Scotland says Ms Hyslop. The culture secretary is also disappointed at the failure to maintain a distinct character between east and west in Scotland. She argues through these decisions Ofcom has opened the door to change but not change we welcome. Ofcom,externalapologised to MSPs for not notifying the Scottish Parliament of its consultation on changes to the regulations for local radio. The broadcasting watchdog wasgiving evidence to the culture committee last week (refresh this link a couple of times). Committee convener Joan McAlpine argued latest change from Ofcom will make commercial radio even less local. Ms McAlpine also asked about thelocalness consultation undertaken by Ofcom,external, where a majority of the respondents were against the proposals, with only the big players like Bauer backing it. Neil Stock from Ofcom explained the responses to the consultation were only one of the pieces of evidence that was considered, citing research the organisation undertook. The committee alsoheard from Bauer and DC Thomson (Refresh this link a couple of times). Capital FM are replacing Scotland's breakfast show with Capital London's breakfast show The latest review of Ofcom's guidance for local radio has meant fewer locally-produced programmes have to be aired. FM stations which provide at least hourly peak-time local news now only have to have six hours of local programmes between 6am and 7pm, down from 10 hours under the previous guidelines. And those which provide local news hourly any time between 6am and 7pm only need to have three hours, down from seven. Ofcom said the alterations were due to changes in competition and listening habits across the radio sector. Global media has announced it will launch UK-wide national breakfast shows on Capital, Heart and Smooth radio. Global say they will be creating the three largest commercial radio breakfast shows in the UK, with 4.8m, 3.7m and 2.7m listeners respectively each week. But it means a reduction in locally produced programmes, with more than 100 jobs at risk due to the changes. Ofcom has approved the move following achange in guidelines,externalfor local radio. Vick Hope and Roman Kemp present Capital breakfast in London, while until recently Jamie Theakston co-hosted Heart breakfast with Emma Bunton What does this mean for Scotland? Read more here. SNP MSP George Adam expresses concern that Ofcom is ""attacking Scottish commercial radio"" by creating a duopoly between Global and Bauer radio using local radio licences. Doing this means local news, local music and local presenters are squeezed he warns. Mr Adam says many of the biggest operators run the local multiplex and essentially set the cost for other stations wanting to use that multiplex. Only one FM licence has been given out by Ofcom in the past ten years, he highlights, which means some stations cannot expand. We have to make sure we still have our voice on radio, he concludes. SNP MSP George Adam leads a member's debate expressing concern about changes to commercial local radio. Mr Adam says OFCOM's changes put pressure on local radio station content and news and its remit has been questions. He's calling for a review of the changes to local radio regulation.

SNP MSP Bob Doris says he is seeking a meeting with the payment systems regulator to call for charges to be eliminated. The first minister highlights that Digital Economy Minister Kate Forbes met with the regulator in December and urges it to use its powers on this. SNP MSP John Mason asks if the first minister agrees that it is even worse when the ATM is removed altogether. The first minister replies there is an ongoing dialogue with banks and she adds she will continue to press the UK government to do the same. Tory MSP Dean Lockhart asks why Scotland is the only part of the UK that has business rates on post office ATMs Ms Sturgeon explains this issue has been raised by the post offices and adds she has undertaken to look into it. The first minister says the ability to freely access cash is vital, especially for small businesses and vulnerable communities. She says the government is calling for a regulator solely responsible for cash infrastructure. Ms McNeill says 2.75 million people rely wholly on cash and warns about the impact ATM charges will have on the poorest communities. I am happy to cooperate on a cross party basis on this issue, replies the first minister, and highlights support for the Which? campaign on this.  Allow Twitter content?

Free-to-use cash machines have been disappearing at a rapid rate across the UK, according to a study by Which? Nearly 1,700 machines started charging for withdrawals in the first three months of the year, with the majority starting to charge in March, according to the consumer lobby group. Cardtronics, which runs most of those, and fellow provider NoteMachine are both likely to charge at more machines. That could mean the country losing 13% of its free ATMs in only a few months. The changes come aftera reduction in the fee operators receive from banks each time an ATM is used. Read more here. Labour MSP Pauline McNeill ask what the Scottish government's response is to reports that
around one in five of Scotland's free-to-use ATMs are expected to
introduce charges to customers in the next 12 months The first minister says the Scottish government doubled the active travel budget. Ms Hamilton says this is Walk to School Week but less than half of pupils do so. The Tory MSP asks for air quality monitors to be considered. We will continue to take action to improve air quality replies the first minister. Ms Sturgeon says that is not helped by knee jerk opposition to policies like the Workplace Parking Levy. According to Transport Scotland: The Scottish government doubled the already record level of investment in walking and cycling from Â£39.2 million in 2017-18 to Â£80 million per year in 2018-19. Much of this budget is allocated to its active travel delivery partners who work across Scotland to deliver projects that will get more people walking and cycling for shorter everyday journeys. They in turn distribute much of this funding to local authorities, community groups, third sector groups and others. View Transport Scotland's budget allocation breakdown,externalfor full details. Tory MSP Rachael Hamilton asks what action the Scottish government is taking to promote
active travel. Tory MSP Jamie Halcro Johnstone asks why financial service apprenticeships are not more widely available. Ms Sturgeon says there is a lot of work going on to build the skills base. She says the biggest concern about the recruitment of skills is the ending of the freedom of movement, however, saying the system of migration must allow us to attract people from abroad. Ms Sturgeon warmly welcomes the announcement. Mr Macdonald asks how the first minister will seek to capitalise on this and get more jobs for Edinburgh. There's no doubt Brexit is a severe threat to jobs replies the fist minister. Â© 2025 BBC.

Daily Mirror Financial Times Will there be any more resignations over the Withdrawal Agreement Bill? The Telegraph's deputy political editor says there may not need to be because No 10 is now considering pulling the bill in view of the widespread opposition to it across the House of Commons. The vote on it had been expected to happen on 7 June. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Theresa May could meet the foreign secretary tomorrow In a sign of unrest at the highest levels of the Tory party, a series of cabinet ministers asked for meetings with Mrs May today to raise their concerns about the Withdrawal Agreement Bill. Downing Street sources told the Press Association it was possible that the PM could meet Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt on Thursday, but there was no confirmation that an audience would be granted for other ministers with reservations about the plan. Home Secretary Sajid Javid has asked for a meeting to discuss his concerns about the prospect of a second referendum, after Mrs May revealed she would grant MPs a vote on whether the Brexit deal should be put to the public. Theresa May has experienced more cabinet resignations than any prime minister since the beginning of Margaret Thatcher's reign - and in a much shorter time. With all of this drama in Westminster ongoing, it would be easy to forget about the little matter of the European elections. As ITV political correspondent Paul Brand points out, the polls for the elections open in less than nine hours. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"A union campaign has been launched to save the BiFab construction yards in Fife - which look set to lose out on work for a huge EDF wind farm project. The Methil and Burntisland yards were mothballed last year having been close to financial collapse. It is feared a failure to secure contracts for EDF's Â£2bn project off the Fife coast could kill the yards. Now unions are calling for a U-turn on plans for the work to be carried out in Indonesia instead of Scotland. Canadian firm takes over BiFab yards BiFab 'effectively closed' claims GMB union BiFab misses out on wind farm order A spokesman for the GMB union said: ""EDF doesn't seem to know or care about the proud industrial history of Fife, forged by energy, from the coal mines to North Sea oil and gas. ""Fife is primed to help deliver the next generation of energy in the form of renewables manufacturing through its yards in Burntisland and Methil. Workers staged a march in 2016 as part of a campaign to safeguard jobs ""So why is EDF sub-contracting the manufacture of the NnGturbine jackets to a yard half way around the world in Indonesia? That's a slap in the face for Fife and for Scotland. ""We have the yards, we have the skills and we have the communities ready to play their part in tackling the climate emergency. EDF must think again and do what's right for Fife, for Scotland and for the environment."" The Unite union, which is also leading the campaign, has said the the BiFab yards in Fife are ""ready and primed"" to work on EDF's new Neart naGoaithe (NnG) wind farm. Spokesman Pat Rafferty said: ""The NnG project could create jobs for over 1,000 people, unlocking much-needed investment and growth for our future. ""If the bulk of the wind turbine jackets are built in yards just 10 miles from the wind farm, it would mean less shipping and significantly less carbon emissions over the lifespan of the NnG project. ""We will fight for every job and fight to get people back to work because the skills base is here in Fife."" A spokeswoman for EDF Renewables refused to comment on ""speculation"" about future contracts. She added: ""We are currently going through a procurement process and once the contracts are ready to be announced we will do so."" But it is understood the French state-owned EDF plans to have massive steel jackets, on which turbines will sit, built in Indonesia before being shipped to Scotland. They would then be installed at its new Neart naGoaithe wind farm, 10 miles off the Fife coast. The project could generate enough electricity to power a city the size of Edinburgh. A spokesman for BiFab owners DF Barnes said: ""We are continuing our negotiations with EDF and remain hopeful of a positive outcome for BiFab."" Missing out on the EDF work would be the latest in a series of blows to the BiFab yards. In March,the contractor building a multi-billion pound offshore wind farm in the Moray Firthconfirmed that BiFab's Fife yards had not won any of the work. A statement by Deme, the Belgian company in charge of procurement for Moray East, emphasised the role of a Belgian-owned yard near Newcastle in having ""a major portion"" of the work. The announcement came a year afterthe remaining shop floor workers at the Fife yards were given redundancy notices. BiFab had previously beentaken over by a Canadian engineering firm- in a deal brokered by the Scottish government.

"This video can not be played In Scunthorpe, residents fear the town will ""shut down"" if British Steel collapses Labour has urged the government to nationalise British Steel in order to protect jobs and the steel industry. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the collapse of British Steel would have a ""devastating impact"" on Scunthorpe. British Steel is on the verge of administration as it continues to lobby for government backing, sources say. The UK's second-biggest steel maker had been trying to secure Â£75m in financial support to help it to address ""Brexit-related issues"". If the firm does not get the cash it would put 5,000 jobs at risk and endanger 20,000 in the supply chain. ""If an agreement cannot be struck with British Steel, the government must act to take a public stake in the company to secure the long term future of the steelworks and protect peoples' livelihoods and communities,"" said Mr Corbyn. The government said it would leave ""no stone unturned"" in its support for the steel industry. British Steel's main plant is at Scunthorpe, but it also has a site in Teesside. Are you a British Steel worker? Please emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external What are the EU rules about state aid? Speaking in the House of Commons, Business Minister Andrew Stephenson said: ""I can reassure the House that, subject to strict legal bounds, the government will leave no stone unturned in its support for the steel industry."" UK Steel's director general, Gareth Stace, said: ""The statement from the business minister today provided a glimmer of hope for the Scunthorpe site. ""This does provide some breathing space for the company, its employees, and the wider steel sector, providing a potential route towards a stable and sustainable future."" The request for emergency financial support from the government is understood to have been reduced from Â£75m to about Â£30m. In April, British Steel borrowed Â£100m from the government to enable it to pay an EU carbon bill, so it could avoid a steep fine. Reports have said that British Steel shareholder Greybull Capital and lenders have agreed to pump new money into the firm. However, unless a deal is reached by Tuesday afternoon, the firm could go into administration within 48 hours. EY would be expected to be appointed as administrators on Wednesday. If a company goes into administration, then the insolvency practitioners appointed to run the business will try to rescue it by selling it, or parts of it, as a going concern. But if that is not possible it will be liquidated, meaning that it will be closed down and its saleable assets will be sold. For staff in Scunthorpe, it's a waiting game. This video can not be played 'They're all quite scared' The BBC's consumer affairs correspondent Colletta Smith spoke to a British Steel staff member who was too worried to be named. He said that two of his colleagues have just got mortgages and are petrified they won't be able to make payments. News that the company is in trouble isn't a surprise though, as there are piles of finished steel on the factory floor, with no customers to send it to, he said. ""We're doing a bit at work, but it's mostly sitting around doing nothing as the orders just aren't there"". He said staff feel let down by the owners. ""They've just stripped this company and now they're putting nothing back. Our only hope is a government bailout, but this time it feels different. I don't think they'll save us."" Sources close to Greybull Capital say its lenders have told them that unless they can secure a Â£30m lifeline they will pull the plug on British Steel tomorrow. The timing of this could hardly be worse for the government coming as it does right before the European elections. Cynics might suggest that Greybull is not unhappy with the timescale of the plea. Business Secretary Greg Clark has avery tough decision, as I've already written. The question may be whether the government can put this down to Brexit mitigation and tap the same source of contingency funds Chris Grayling disastrously used to procure emergency ferry capacity. At least there would be an immediate dividend - to stave off the collapse of a firm that employs 4,500 people directly and has 20,000 more at risk in the supply chain. However, having already lent Â£100m to cover a genuinely Brexit-related carbon emissions bill - further assistance to a private company struggling in a deeply challenged industry may be a precedent they would rather not set. Last Thursday, British Steel said it had the backing of shareholders and lenders and that operations were continuing as usual while it sought a ""permanent solution"" from the government to its financial troubles. It is understood that along with administration, nationalisation or a management buyout are being discussed as fall-back options for the company. British Steel's troubles have been linked to a slump in orders from European customers âdue to uncertainty over the Brexit process. The firm has also been struggling with the weakness of the pound since the EU referendum in June 2016 and the escalating trade US-China trade war. One of its biggest customers is Network Rail, 95% of whose rails are supplied by British Steel's Scunthorpe plant. In 2007, India's Tata conglomerate entered the UK steel market after it bought the Anglo Dutch group, Corus. In 2010, the business was renamed Tata Steel Europe. After a difficult few years, Tata sold the Scunthorpe long products division to private equity firm Greybull Capital for a nominal Â£1. Greybull's rescue came during the depths of the steel crisis in 2016 and saved more than 4,000 jobs. It then rebranded the company as British Steel and recently returned it to profit. On Monday, the government, trade unions and employers signed a UK Steel Charter in Parliament.  The charter calls on the government and large companies to buy British to boost UK industry.

"In Spring 2016, Tata Steel's loss-making Long Products division, based at the steelworks which dominates Scunthorpe, was on its knees. The news that private equity group Greybull Capital would buy it for a token Â£1 was hailed as a new dawn. The deal came with a promise to invest Â£400m in the business, with the new owners also reviving the British Steel brand name. Then-Business Secretary Sajid Javid said he believed ""there really is a viable, sustainable future for world-class steelmaking in this country"". In 2017 and 2018 Greybull returned British Steel to profit. Three years on from its supposed rebirth, the company has collapsed into liquidation. Under Greybull, British Steel's ultimate parent company is Jersey-based Olympus Steel Limited. In British Steel's most recent accounts filed in May 2018, director Gerald Reichmann writes that the company has access to ""considerable financial resources"", although these are not quantified. The accounts show Olympus has lent British Steel Â£154m in the form of a secured loan. They also reveal that nearly Â£17m in interest on loans was charged by the parent company each year in 2017 and 2018. Greybull says that this interest has been accrued but not paid out in order to support the steel business through its turnaround and that all the company's profits have been ploughed back into the business. Greybull charged British Steel Â£3m in ""management fees"" in 2017 and again in 2018. The company says that those fees are 80% lower than those charged by British Steel's previous owner, Tata. Greybull Capital is a private - and secretive - equity partnership which invests in failing companies and tries to turn them around. It was set up in 2010, managed by French-born brothers Nathaniel and Marc Meyohas, along with Richard Perlhagen. They were later joined by Daniel Goldstein. He now runs the investment company with Marc Meyohas. Nathaniel Meyohas and Mr Perlhagen  have both subsequently left the firm. Greybull describes itself on its website as ""an entrepreneurial investment group, passionate about making companies successful"". Its purchase of Tata's loss-making division has been one of its highest profile deals in the UK. However, the firm also presided over Britain's biggest airline bankruptcy. It bought a majority stake in Monarch Airlines in 2014, with an investment of Â£125m. But the airline failed in October 2017, triggering what was described as the UK's biggest ever peacetime repatriation of stranded holidaymakers. Hundreds of people arrived at UK airports to find their flights cancelled. Nearly 1,900 staff lost their jobs. The cost to the taxpayer of repatriating about 110,000 stranded travellers,externalhas been estimated at Â£40.5m. The airline blamed the collapse on the threat of terror and other economic conditions. Greybull's website says that its rescue kept the airline flying for three years longer than if it had not stepped in and provided more than 2,700 people with work. Greybull subsequently took over Monarch's airline engineering arm in October 2018, but that went bust in January. Hundreds of jobs were then lost. In September 2015, Greybull bought the My Local convenience chain of 120 stores from supermarket chain Morrisons. But the business - which employed 1,650 people - fell into administration in June 2016. Greybull has also backed electrical retailer Comet and Riley's snooker halls. Both ended up collapsing. However, the firm has also had notable successes. In 2013, Greybull bought Metalrax, a specialist in non-stick coated steel for the bakeware industry, out of administration. It was renamed Arc Specialist Engineering, which was bought by its management team and investors in 2017. It also owns Plessey, another name from Britain's industrial past, and is seeking to turn it into a leader in LED technology. Former City minister Lord Myners has questioned Greybull's stewardship of the companies it has operated. ""Greybull has a record of owning businesses which fail, but where apparently Greybull does not lose serious money,"" he told the BBC. ""In fact, from a number of its failed investments, it's made money"". Greybull insists that it is in the ""business of turning around failing companies and that includes significant risk"".

"This video can not be played We Are Middlesbrough: Pregnant teenagers tell their story Middlesbrough has the highest rate of teenage pregnancy in England and Wales. But one 16-year-old from the town says getting pregnant saved her life. Robyn used to ""get mortal"" (drunk) and ""end up at random parties"". But when she was pregnant, she vowed to change. She stopped drinking and smoking marijuana, saying: ""I used to be pretty crazy. Being pregnant has calmed me down."" Teen births have been falling nationally but rising in Middlesbrough. Robyn's mother Shelly recalls one night when the police arrived at the house - yet again. ""It was around midnight and the police knocked on the door - they were bringing Robyn home from a party. ""She'd drunk an entire bottle of vodka at an unknown man's flat, passed out, got into the bath and was found sprawled naked on the living room floor. She was 15."" Robyn added: ""When I met my boyfriend and got pregnant I realised that that couldn't happen any more. ""I'm so excited to meet my baby girl - we had a gender reveal party and even though I would have been happy with a boy, I really wanted my own little girl. ""When we popped the balloon and I saw the pink confetti, I cried with happiness."" Her daughter is due at the end of June. Robyn says society has a double standard when it comes to boys and girls Shelly said: ""Robyn is actually the fourth generation of teen mams in our family. ""I've told Robyn it's time to grow up now and she has - I'm proud of how she's changed for her baby. ""When Robyn was a bit older I went to Durham University and completed a degree in human science - I think of it as doing my life the other way around."" In Middlesbrough, there were 43.8 teen pregnancies per 1,000 girls in the year to December 2017, compared with an average of 17.9 in England and Wales. The next highest rate was in St Helens in Merseyside with 37.1 pregnancies per 1,000 teenagers. Teenage pregnancy is linked to fewer life chances,external- a higher risk of the child and the parent living in poverty, an increased risk of infant mortality and a higher chance of the mother experiencing mental health problems. It is more then 15 years since the government launched its Teenage Pregnancy Strategy in response to England having one of the highest teenage pregnancy rates in Western Europe. Since then, the under-18 conception rate has dropped by 60% and the proportion of teenage mothers in education and training has doubled. But in Middlesbrough over the two years from 2015 to 2017 it jumped from 36.5 to 43.8 - a rise of 20%. Megan says she has to restrict herself in order to care for her baby Megan, who is also from Middlesbrough, was 17 when she learned she was 23 weeks pregnant with her baby boy. She said: ""My baby will be loved and cared for. ""I've finished my college course in performing arts and after about a year out I plan to either go back to college or get a job. ""Being a teenage mam won't stop me. I'm lucky - my family are supportive."" Durham University's professor of sociology Dr Kimberly Jamie said: ""We need to stop accepting the middle-class life trajectory as the 'right' way for young people, especially women, to live their lives. ""The school to university to career to house to marriage to children isn't possible or desirable for all young women, yet those who take a different route through life are positioned as irresponsible, or as having somehow failed. ""Teenage pregnancy is understood as a death knell for any kind of career success rather than acknowledging that post-16 education and careers are still available for women in their 30s or 40s when their children are grown up and they have time to start a new career.""

"The prime minister is resisting calls to resign despite a growing backlash against her Brexit plan from Conservative MPs. Several cabinet ministers told the BBC that she cannot stay, with one saying it is ""the end of the line"". Tory backbenchers met on Wednesday evening, but decided not to change rules which would have allowed an immediate vote of no confidence in her. The BBC's political editor says the PM seems to have bought herself 36 hours. Mrs May will meet the chairman of the influential backbench 1922 Committee, Sir Graham Brady, on Friday. In the meantime, the UK will vote on Thursday in European Parliament elections, with the Conservatives widely predicted to do very badly. Allow Twitter content?

Discontent at Mrs May's leadership grew significantly after she set out plans for the Withdrawal Agreement Bill - the legislation needed to implement the agreement between the UK and EU on the terms of Brexit. It included a number of concessions designed to attract cross-party support, including new guarantees on workers' rights, environmental protections and the Northern Irish border, as well a customs ""compromise"". Latest: Reaction to PM's Brexit ""compromise"" offer No 10 plans to stand firm as PM's future unclear But Brexiteers in her own party reacted angrily to it, particularly a promise to give MPs a vote on another referendum if they backed the bill. Mrs May insists it is Parliament's ""last chance"" to get Brexit done. Several cabinet ministers broke cover on Wednesday afternoon to signal their unhappiness with the bill, among them Home Secretary Sajid Javid. Allow Twitter content?

Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt also requested a private meeting with the PM. But Laura Kuenssberg said the PM declined to meet the ministers - both of whom are seen as possible contenders to be the next Conservative leader - and instead seemed determined to ""tough it out"". Sources told the BBC the chief whip, Julian Smith, made it clear to backbench MPs that the prime minister was not resigning. The 1922 Committee had been expected to vote on Wednesday evening on whether to change the party's rules to allow an immediate vote of no confidence in the prime minister. Current rules dictate that as the PM survived such a vote in December, she cannot face another one for 12 months. However, the vote on a rule change did not take place - and afterwards, some members expressed their discontent. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The PM has already pledged to set a timetable for a new leader to take over after MPs vote on the Withdrawal Agreement Bill - in theory, on 7 June. But calls for her to go sooner than that have begun to come from Conservatives who had, until now, stayed loyal. PM under fire over new Brexit plan Is May's 'new' Brexit deal actually new? Writing in the Financial Times,external, Tom Tugendhat said: ""Leadership matters; it has been absent for too long,"" he said. ""This can only change with a new prime minister."" Former minister Tim Loughton said it was ""very sad"", but it was time for her to go - another, Stephen Crabb, said there needs to be a new PM ""within weeks"". More familiar critics also added to the clamour for her resignation. Leading Brexiteer Steve Baker said it was ""not personal"" but about ""the future of the country"", and his party ""needs to reassemble a governing coalition willing to take us out of the EU"", under a new leader. There have been doubts about Theresa May's leadership for many months. She herself has more or less said she will resign next month. But something different has happened today, the mood has really changed. More and more Conservatives publicly are saying she has to quit as soon as possible. Ministers have been saying to me privately she has now reached the end of line. Number 10 is adamant, though, that nothing has really changed she will press on and still try and get her Brexit deal though. But it feels the government is almost in breakdown. And it's simply not clear at this moment they'll really be able to hang on. The UK was meant to leave the EU on 29 March, but that has been pushed back to 31 October after the Commons rejected Mrs May's withdrawal deal with Brussels three times. Attempts to find a cross-party compromise via formal talks broke down last week, and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has rejected Mrs May's attempts to win his MPs over with her Brexit withdrawal bill plan. Mr Corbyn said her ""bold new deal"" was really a ""repackaged version"" of her failed withdrawal agreement, adding: ""No Labour MP can vote for a deal with the promise of a prime minister who only has days left in her job."" He said the issue of Brexit had been ""dividing our society and poisoning our democracy"", but claimed Mrs May's deal ""does not represent a genuine compromise"". Addressing her critics in the Commons earlier, Mrs May said: ""In time, another prime minister will be standing at this despatch box, but while I am here, I have a duty to be clear with the House about the facts. ""If we are going to deliver Brexit in this Parliament, we have to pass a Withdrawal Agreement Bill, and we will not do so without holding votes on the issues that have divided us the most,"" she said. ""In the end, our job in the House is to take decisions, not duck them."" The SNP's leader in Westminster Ian Blackford - who supports a further referendum to remain in the EU - said it was time for the prime minister to go, having ""lost the trust of the public"". ""This deal is dead,"" he added. The DUP, which props up Mrs May's government, has also refused the vote for the bill. Labour's Liz Kendall backed the call for a public vote, telling Mrs May she will not get enough support for her bill from opposition members without including a confirmatory ballot as part of the deal - rather than just offering a vote on whether to have one. But Conservative MP Vicky Ford said: ""We cannot continue to leave our country in this uncertainty. It has to stop. The whole House has to stop saying no to everything on the table just because it is not our favourite dish. ""If we vote for this bill we can move on and the discussion on the next stage can start."" This video can not be played Theresa May says failure to back her deal risks ""no Brexit at all"" Mrs May is bringing the Withdrawal Agreement Bill - legislation required to bring her agreement into UK law - to Parliament in early June. In an attempt to win over MPs across the House, she announced the following concessions: A guarantee of a Commons vote on whether to hold another referendum on the government's Brexit deal A vote on different customs options, including a government proposal for a temporary customs union for goods - what Mrs May called a ""customs compromise"" A legal obligation for the UK to ""seek to conclude alternative arrangements"" to replace the Northern Ireland backstop by the end of 2020 If the backstop does come into force, the bill would guarantee Northern Ireland remains aligned with the rest of the UK and remains in same customs territory Legislation to ensure workers rights are ""every bit as good, if not better"" after Brexit - and guarantees of no dilution in environmental standards A legal duty to seek changes to the political declaration on future relations with the EU Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser 'Like Armageddon': Five fires rage in Los Angeles, with whole communities destroyed What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

"London will be one of the first cities to benefit from faster services EE will switch on its 5G service in six UK cities on 30 May, the first mobile network in the UK to do so. People in London, Cardiff, Edinburgh, Belfast, Birmingham and Manchester will be first to get faster services with plans for 10 more cities to be added this year. Prices for 5G - which will require new handsets - will start at Â£54 per month for 10 gigabytes of data. EE confirmed that its range of 5G phones would not include Huawei. ""We're pausing the launch of the new Huawei 5G smartphones coming to market,"" said a spokesman, adding that EE is working with both the Chinese firm and Google to ""make sure we can carry out the right level of testing and quality assurance"" for customers. It follows a decision from Google to bar the smartphone maker from some updates to the Android operating system. ""This is the start of the UK's 5G journey and great news for our customers that want and need the best connections,"" said Marc Allera, chief executive of BT's consumer division, which owns EE. It admits that this is just phase one of its roll-out, with ""full next-generation 5G"" not available until 2022. Rival Vodafone plans to launch its 5G service in July. It has also withdrawn Huawei's 5G-enabled Mate 20X - from its line-up of phones. Retailer Carphone Warehouse has also said it will not allow customers to pre-order Huawei's 5G handsets. Several other countries have announced 5G services, including South Korea and the US. Kester Mann, an analyst at research firm CCS Insight, said: ""In getting 5G as soon as next week, the UK will have completed a remarkable turnaround from laggard to leader."" ""Being first-to-market with 5G matters little to consumers, but is clearly an important honour for BT."" EE promised three major improvements for customers making the swap from 4G to 5G: increased capacity - making it easier to get service in busy places such as railway stations and stadiums average speeds will go up to 150Mbps (megabits per second) compared with a top speed of 50Mbps when 4G was launched. Some customers will get speeds of up to one gigabit, with improvements for everyone over time low latency - of particular benefit for online games and new services such as those utilising augmented reality The mobile operator has also signed an exclusive deal with Niantic, the makers of Pokemon Go, to carry its augmented reality game Harry Potter: Wizards United game when it launches in the UK in the summer. Matthew Howett, a mobile analyst with research firm Assembly, said: ""To convince consumers to make the leap from 4G to 5G, it's important to communicate that it's more than just about speed. ""While peak download speeds will be faster, crucially there will be more capacity, which will allow for a whole host of new applications and services."" There have been concerns raised about the role played by Chinese firm Huawei, which supplies network equipment to the UK's mobile operators for their roll-out of 5G, following the US decision to curb its ability to do business in America. Mr Allera told the BBC that EE does currently use Huawei's equipment, although it is in the process of removing it from the core of its 4G network. The core is where the most sensitive functions occur, including device authentication, voice and data-routing and billing. However, EE does intend to use Huawei within its radio access network (Ran), which allows users to send data to and from the core. ""There is no current government guidance to suggest we should not use Huawei, but if the guidance changes we will reconsider. That will be disruptive but there are other people that provide equipment,"" he said. But Mr Howett thinks that a ban on Huawei could be problematic, not just for EE but for all the UK's operators, because it is in a significant part of their networks. ""There is little interoperability between vendors, which means it is difficult to deploy non-Huawei 5G equipment alongside existing Huawei 4G equipment. ""A ban would require operators to replace such equipment before they could deploy 5G technology,"" he said. EE is planning to add 100 new 5G sites each month. That will gradually bring coverage to: Bristol Coventry Leicester Nottingham Sheffield Liverpool Hull Leeds Newcastle Ten more towns and cities will get services in 2020, including Aberdeen, Cambridge, Derby, Gloucester, Peterborough, Plymouth and Portsmouth. The handsets available will include the Samsung Galaxy S10 5G, OnePlus's 7 Pro 5G and Oppo's Reno 5G phones. 5G will let users 'ditch home broadband' Vodafone to launch 5G UK service in July 'Like Armageddon': Five fires rage in Los Angeles, with whole communities destroyed What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

Theresa May could meet the foreign secretary tomorrow In a sign of unrest at the highest levels of the Tory party, a series of cabinet ministers asked for meetings with Mrs May today to raise their concerns about the Withdrawal Agreement Bill. Downing Street sources told the Press Association it was possible that the PM could meet Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt on Thursday, but there was no confirmation that an audience would be granted for other ministers with reservations about the plan. Home Secretary Sajid Javid has asked for a meeting to discuss his concerns about the prospect of a second referendum, after Mrs May revealed she would grant MPs a vote on whether the Brexit deal should be put to the public. Theresa May has experienced more cabinet resignations than any prime minister since the beginning of Margaret Thatcher's reign - and in a much shorter time. With all of this drama in Westminster ongoing, it would be easy to forget about the little matter of the European elections.

"In a bid to limit ocean pollution, the UK government will introduce new controls on single use plastic items next year. The measures cover plastic straws, plastic drinks stirrers and plastic cotton buds in England from April 2020. Only plastic drinks stirrers will be totally banned from sale - currently 316 million are used a year. Environmental groups have praised the move but say the government needs to take far more decisive action. The government press release announcing the new restrictions talks of ""a ban on the supply of plastic straws"" but in reality the aim is instead to restrict their availability. Plastic straw and cotton bud ban proposed The last (plastic) straw: Who's banning them? Disabled people 'need plastic straws' Shops including supermarkets will not be allowed to sell the straws but they will on sale by registered pharmacies in stores and online. That's because disabled groups have highlighted how straws are essential for everyday life and that a total ban could lead to the risk of dehydration. Plastic-stemmed cotton buds will still be available for use in laboratories and by forensic scientists According to the announcement, bars and restaurants will not be allowed to display plastic straws or automatically hand them out but they will be able to provide them if people ask. When asked who could request a straw, a spokesperson for the environment ministry Defra said: ""Anyone can ask for a straw and be given one without needing to prove a disability - we've been working with disabled groups so that they don't feel stigmatised."" Plastic stirrers will be subject to a total ban. However plastic-stemmed cotton buds, although restricted from general sale to the public, will still be available. Medical and scientific laboratories will be able to buy them for use in research and for forensic tasks in criminal investigations. Defra reckons 1.8bn plastic-stemmed cotton buds are used and thrown away every year in England. The government has been considering action on single-use plastic items since the public reaction to David Attenborough's landmark Blue Planet II documentaries nearly two years ago. At the time, Environment Secretary Michael Gove described being haunted by the image of marine life harmed by plastic and launched consultations on a series of measures to curb single-use items. As part of today's announcement that controls would come into effect next April, Mr Gove said: ""These items are often used for just a few minutes but take hundreds of years to break down, ending up in our seas and oceans and harming precious marine life. This video can not be played Five ways to break up with plastic ""So today I am taking action to turn the tide on plastic pollution, and ensure we leave our environment in a better state for future generations."" This comes as Scotland is also taking steps to restrict or ban plastic straws, and plastic-stemmed cotton buds. The Welsh government has also been considering similar measures. Earlier this week the European Union formally adopted a plan to ban a longer list of items including plastic straws, plastic cutlery and plastic plates by 2021. Green groups say they are pleased that the government is taking action but many are critical that the measures do not go further. WWF called for a ban on all ""avoidable single-use plastic"" by 2025 and said ministers needed ""to really ramp up their commitments"". The Marine Conservation Society, which said it found on average 17 cotton buds for every 100m of beach in England, said Mr Gove needed to do more to reduce plastic consumption and increase recycling rates. The Campaign to Protect Rural England (CPRE) said Mr Gove should phase out single-use items altogether and warned that replacements made with alternative materials might still be harmful. The move comes as many takeaway restaurants are already introducing biodegradable alternatives.

"Two men have been shot dead in separate incidents in County Dublin in less than 24 hours. On Tuesday night, a man was found dead beside a burning car at Rowans Little in Walshestown, near Balbriggan in north County Dublin. He has been identified as as 22-year-old SeÃ¡n Little from Coolock in Dublin. It is understood he was known to gardaÃ­ (Irish police) because of his links with organised crime. According to Irish broadcaster RTÃ, he was an associate of the leader of a Finglas-based organised crime gang, involved in an ongoing feud with a Blanchardstown drugs gang. He also had close links to theKinahan crime gang., RTÃ reports. Police vehicles and investigators at the scene of the first incident in Walshestown GardaÃ­ said he was shot a number of times before his body was discovered at about 23:20 local time. On Wednesday afternoon, a second man was shot dead on the north side of Dublin. He was killed on Marigold Road in the Darndale area at about 16:00 local time. The scene of a fatal shooting in the Darndale area of Dublin Initial reports suggest the victim was known to gardaÃ­ and that the shooting could be drugs related. However, it is not known if the two deaths are connected. A burnt-out car was removed from the scene of the first incident following a forensic examination Shane Harrison, BBC News NI Ireland correspondent In the first incident, the fact that the body was found beside a burnt-out car may suggest the victim was murdered somewhere else and taken to the scene, off the Belfast-to-Dublin motorway, before being dropped from the vehicle near the exit close to Balbriggan. Although it is early in the investigation, detectives are keenly aware of three ongoing gangland feuds: one in Drogheda, a few kilometres north, and another in Blanchardstown in west Dublin - both are over the drugs trade. And then there is the on-going Kinahan-Hutch feud that began in 2015 and is believed to have claimed 17 lives so far.

"Huawei unveiled new phones powered by ARM-based chips, on Tuesday UK-based chip designer ARM has told staff it must suspend business with Huawei, according to internal documents obtained by the BBC. ARM instructed employees to halt ""all active contracts, support entitlements, and any pending engagementsâ with Huawei and its subsidiaries to comply with a recent US trade clampdown. ARM's designs form the basis of most mobile device processors worldwide. In a company memo, it said its designs contained âUS origin technologyâ. As a consequence, it believes it is affected by the Trump administration's ban. One analyst described the move, if it became long-term, as an âinsurmountableâ blow to Huaweiâs business. He said it would greatly affect the firm's ability to develop its own chips, many of which are currently built with ARMâs underlying technology, for which it pays a licence. These are used in the Chinese company's 5G base stations and computer servers in addition to its smartphones. Cambridge-headquartered ARM had been described as the UK's largest tech firm until its takeover by a Japanese fund. It employs 6,000 workersand lists eight offices in the US,external. In a statement on Wednesday it said: ""ARM is complying with the latest restrictions set forth by the US government and is having ongoing conversations with the appropriate US government agencies to ensure we remain compliant. ""ARM values its relationship with our long-time partner HiSilicon and we are hopeful for a swift resolution on this matter."" Huawei has issued a brief statement of its own. ""We value our close relationships with our partners, but recognise the pressure some of them are under, as a result of politically motivated decisions,"" it said. ""We are confident this regrettable situation can be resolved and our priority remains to continue to deliver world-class technology and products to our customers around the world."" ARM is a chip designer founded in 1990. In September 2016 it was acquired by Japanese telecoms giant Softbank, but remains based in Cambridge, UK. ARM does not manufacture computer processors itself, but rather licenses its semiconductor technologies to others. In some cases, manufacturers only license ARM's architecture, or ""instruction sets"", which determine how processors handle commands. This option gives chip-makers greater freedom to customise their own designs. In other cases, manufacturers license ARM's processor core designs - which describes how the chips' transistors should be arranged. These blueprints still need to be combined with other elements - such as memory and radios - to create what is referred to as a system-on-chip. As a result, when you hear talk of a device being powered by a Samsung Exynos, Qualcomm Snapdragon or Apple A11 chip - or one in a Huawei smartphone - it is still ARM's technology that is involved. ARM's US headquarters are in San Jose, California, and the firm has offices in Washington, Arizona, Texas and Massachusetts. Read more: What is ARM and why was it worth $24bn? ARMâs staff were informed of the decision on 16 May, following the US Commerce Departmentâs move to add Huawei to its âentity listâ of companies with which American firms could no longer do business. The BBC has also seen a company memo dated 18 May detailing the implications of the export ban. Huawei's microchip vulnerability explained Huawei's Android loss: How it affects you Huawei's use of Android restricted by Google On Monday 20 May, US government officialsissued a 90-day reprieve,externalon some of the restrictions in order to minimise immediate disruption. But ARM believes that the temporary licence involved does not apply to it. A spokesman for ARM declined to offer any additional clarity about the current status of its Huawei contracts. A break with ARM would make it difficult for Huawei to develop future generations of its Kirin processors According to one memo, ARM staff were instructed to suspend all interactions with Huawei and its subsidiaries. It advised staff to send a note informing Huawei (or related) employees that due to an âunfortunate situationâ, they were not allowed to âprovide support, delivery technology (whether software, code, or other updates), engage in technical discussions, or otherwise discuss technical matters with Huawei, HiSilicon or any of the other named entitiesâ. ARM staff that come into contact with employees at industry events must âpolitely decline and stopâ any conversations about the business, the guidance said - stressing that individuals could be held personally liable for breaking the trade rules. The ban also appeared to apply to ARM China, the China-based company in which ARM Holdings owns a 49% stake. It was set up as a joint venture with a Chinese investment consortium last year in order to enable ARM to develop, sell and offer support for its products in the region. Huawei told reporters on Tuesday that its âplan Bâ for software would be to develop its own operating system, something it has already been working on for some time. However, it will be significantly more difficult for the firm to source home-grown components of sufficient quality. Huawei currently sources some of its chips from HiSilicon, which it owns. However, while produced in China, HiSiliconâs chips are built using underlying technology created by ARM. While HiSilicon and Huawei are free to carry on using and manufacturing existing chips, the ban would mean the company could no longer turn to ARM for assistance in developing components for devices in future. HiSilicon's upcoming processor, Kirin 985, is due be used in Huawei devices later this year. According to a source at ARM, it is not expected to be affected by the ban. However, the next iteration of the chip has not yet been completed - and is likely to need to be rebuilt from scratch, the source said. Huawei also uses ARM's designs for its recently unveiled Kunpeng chips. These are used to power its TaiShan-series computer servers,which are designed to provide cloud computing and storage to clients,external. In addition, the company told analysts in January that the Tiangang chip at the heart of its 5G base stations is also ARM-based. Huawei's carrier division chief Ryan Ding showed off its 5G base station chip alongside an image saying it involved a ""high-performance ARM-based processor"" ""The problem of the whole telecoms industry is that so much of it is based on the exchange of technology between different companies - whether that's chip companies, software providers or the makers of other hardware,"" commented Alan Burkitt-Gray, editor-at-large of the telecoms news site Capacity Media. He added that Huawei would likely face other problems licensing 5G-related tech from others, and in turn US-based companies would now be unable to licence the Chinese company's 5G inventions. ""This will carve out a chasm in the industry between Huawei-originated intellectual property and the rest of the world's,"" he said. ""It's just a total mess and it's happened at a critical time for the rollout of 5G."" The relationship between ARM and Huawei engineers is tight - earlier this month Huawei announced its intention to build a research centre only 15 minutes from ARMâs headquarters in Cambridge, UK. The latest development follows news that Huawei will lose access to some of Google's Android services ""ARM is the foundation of Huaweiâs smartphone chip designs, so this is an insurmountable obstacle for Huawei,â said Geoff Blaber, from CCS Insight. ""That said, with an abundance of companies in Huaweiâs supply chain already having taken action to comply with the US order, Huaweiâs ability to operate was already severely affected.â What is not yet clear is whether ARM is acting on its own interpretation of the US rules, or whether it has been advised by the Commerce Department. ""If that interpretation is correct, thatâs going to affect every semiconductor company in the world,â remarked analyst Lee Ratliff, from IHS Markit. ""Theyâre not going to be able to easily replace these parts with new, in-house designs - the semiconductor industry in China is nascent.â _______ Additional reporting by Leo Kelion Follow Dave Lee on Twitter@DaveLeeBBC,external Do you have more information about this or any other technology story?

"This video can not be played We Are Middlesbrough: Pregnant teenagers tell their story Middlesbrough has the highest rate of teenage pregnancy in England and Wales. But one 16-year-old from the town says getting pregnant saved her life. Robyn used to ""get mortal"" (drunk) and ""end up at random parties"". But when she was pregnant, she vowed to change. She stopped drinking and smoking marijuana, saying: ""I used to be pretty crazy. Being pregnant has calmed me down."" Teen births have been falling nationally but rising in Middlesbrough. Robyn's mother Shelly recalls one night when the police arrived at the house - yet again. ""It was around midnight and the police knocked on the door - they were bringing Robyn home from a party. ""She'd drunk an entire bottle of vodka at an unknown man's flat, passed out, got into the bath and was found sprawled naked on the living room floor. She was 15."" Robyn added: ""When I met my boyfriend and got pregnant I realised that that couldn't happen any more. ""I'm so excited to meet my baby girl - we had a gender reveal party and even though I would have been happy with a boy, I really wanted my own little girl. ""When we popped the balloon and I saw the pink confetti, I cried with happiness."" Her daughter is due at the end of June. Robyn says society has a double standard when it comes to boys and girls Shelly said: ""Robyn is actually the fourth generation of teen mams in our family. ""I've told Robyn it's time to grow up now and she has - I'm proud of how she's changed for her baby. ""When Robyn was a bit older I went to Durham University and completed a degree in human science - I think of it as doing my life the other way around."" In Middlesbrough, there were 43.8 teen pregnancies per 1,000 girls in the year to December 2017, compared with an average of 17.9 in England and Wales. The next highest rate was in St Helens in Merseyside with 37.1 pregnancies per 1,000 teenagers. Teenage pregnancy is linked to fewer life chances,external- a higher risk of the child and the parent living in poverty, an increased risk of infant mortality and a higher chance of the mother experiencing mental health problems. It is more then 15 years since the government launched its Teenage Pregnancy Strategy in response to England having one of the highest teenage pregnancy rates in Western Europe. Since then, the under-18 conception rate has dropped by 60% and the proportion of teenage mothers in education and training has doubled. But in Middlesbrough over the two years from 2015 to 2017 it jumped from 36.5 to 43.8 - a rise of 20%. Megan says she has to restrict herself in order to care for her baby Megan, who is also from Middlesbrough, was 17 when she learned she was 23 weeks pregnant with her baby boy. She said: ""My baby will be loved and cared for. ""I've finished my college course in performing arts and after about a year out I plan to either go back to college or get a job. ""Being a teenage mam won't stop me. I'm lucky - my family are supportive."" Durham University's professor of sociology Dr Kimberly Jamie said: ""We need to stop accepting the middle-class life trajectory as the 'right' way for young people, especially women, to live their lives. ""The school to university to career to house to marriage to children isn't possible or desirable for all young women, yet those who take a different route through life are positioned as irresponsible, or as having somehow failed. ""Teenage pregnancy is understood as a death knell for any kind of career success rather than acknowledging that post-16 education and careers are still available for women in their 30s or 40s when their children are grown up and they have time to start a new career.""

"The government has decided not to provide extra money to British Steel,which is to enter insolvency. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn had called on Theresa May to take a public stake in the company, having previously said that Brexit could be an opportunity to pump more cash into British industry. He said that European Union (EU) rules restricted so-called ""state aid"", so Brexit could make it easier for the British government to support the British steel industry. But other EU member states, such as France and Germany, spend far more than the UK on state aid despite also signing up to the same single market rules, so are they really an obstacle? And leaving the EU may not mean an end to these rules. Other state-aid restrictions would be likely to apply to post-Brexit Britain, such as World Trade Organization rules and the terms of any future trade deal with the EU. State aid is financial assistance given by the government to companies or other organisations that has the potential to distort market competition. The aid can be in the form of direct cash grants or indirect aid - such as preferential borrowing rates or tax credits. Under EU rules, member-state governments are allowed to provide state aid only with approval from the European Commission. For example, in 2015 the UK government submitted plans to provide a subsidy to Drax power station to convert one of its units from coal to biomass fuel. Following an investigation, the commission ruled in favour of the scheme. There are exceptions to the rules. For example, governments can provide aid for broadband infrastructure without prior approval. And aid worth less than 200,000 euros (Â£175,000) over three years is exempt. The EU Commission says too much steel is produced in Europe. As a result, it has been inclined to take a fairly tough line on state aid in this sector. In 2016 for example, the commission ordered Belgium to recover 211m euros in illegal state aid it had given to its steel industry. That does not mean all state aid is impossible, but the government would have to make a case that assistance was within the rules, or fell under one of the exemptions. One possibility would be to argue that the steel industry was essential for national security, but it is far from clear the commission would accept that. If the UK left the EU single market, it would no longer formally be bound by the EU's state-aid rules. However, the EU is concerned the UK could use Brexit as an opportunity to undermine the single market, by giving its companies an unfair advantage. Thepolitical declaration,externalon the future relationship between the UK and the EU says it must ""ensure open and fair competition"" and that should include provisions to cover state aid - but Theresa May has repeatedly failed to get this through Parliament. In her Florence speech, in 2017, she said the UK and EU agree ""trying to beat other countries' industries by unfairly subsidising one's own is a serious mistake"". Aside from what is agreed with the EU, after Brexit, Britain will still belong to the World Trade Organization, which also has state-aid rules: members can impose tariffs - taxes on imports - on countries that excessively subsidise domestic industry. The EU measures,externalhow much money countries spend on state aid, as a proportion of their economy. The UK ranks very low down, spending just 0.38% of its gross domestic product - the total value of all good and services produced. This is far lower than Germany (1.31%), France (0.76%) and Poland (1.59%). Therefore, it seems likely that EU single market rules are not the only thing limiting state aid. The Labour leader said the government should have decided it wanted to own British Steel and nationalised it - but that is also tricky under EU rules. A government can own a company under state-aid rules - but it is not allowed to keep it going if it would otherwise fail. So if a government could convince the European Commission that buying the business would be a sensible move that any investor would make for a profit, it would not be classified as state aid. That might have been a difficult argument to make with British Steel. What claims do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

"British Steel has been placed in compulsory liquidation, putting 5,000 jobs at risk and endangering 20,000 in the supply chain. The move follows a breakdown in rescue talks between the government and the company's owner, Greybull. The Government's Official Receiver has taken control of the company as part of the liquidation process. The search for a buyer for British Steel has already begun. In the meantime, it will trade normally. The Official Receiver said British Steel Ltd had been wound up in the High Court and the immediate priority was to continue safe operation of the site. The company was transferred to the Official Receiver because British Steel, its shareholders and the government were not able to, or would not, support the business. That meant the company did not have to funds to pay for an administration. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn and Theresa May clashed over British Steel at PMQs The other companies within the British Steel group are continuing to trade as normal and are not in insolvency. British Steel failure: The role of Greybull What are the EU rules about state aid? The Official Receiver and EY are looking for a buyer for the business. If they fail to find one, the firm would be wound up and redundancies would follow. ""I appreciate that this is a difficult time for the company's employees and I want to thank them for their ongoing co-operation,"" Receiver David Chapman said. ""The company in liquidation is continuing to trade and supply its customers while I consider options for the business. British Steel has about 5,000 employees. There are 3,000 at Scunthorpe, with another 800 on Teesside and in north-eastern England. The rest are in France, the Netherlands and various sales offices round the world. Their wages this week have been paid by Greybull and the government will pick up the bill from now on. Roy Rickhuss, general secretary of the steelworkers' trade union, Community, said: ""This news will heap more worries on workers and everyone connected with British Steel, but it will also end the uncertainty under Greybull's ownership and must be seized as an opportunity to look for an alternative future. ""It is vital now that cool heads prevail and all parties focus on saving the jobs. Kevin Prior, pictured with his partner Kayleigh Manderson, said rumours about the plant had been ""circulating for weeks"" Staff in Scunthorpe havealso reacted. ""Everyone is terrified,"" said steelworker Kevin Prior. The 32-year-old scrap metal cutter has been at the plant since 2015 and his sister and brother-in-law also work at there. He said rumours about the company's future had been circulating for a number of weeks. ""It's just heartbreaking,"" he said. ""It's horrible to hear that my sister is crying herself to sleep because she doesn't know what's going to happen with her husband's job and what that means for them."" As well as the plant's workers the North Lincolnshire town's economy relies heavily on the giant steel works, with an estimated 20,000 jobs linked to the site. Its closure would be a body blow, with some residents claiming it would leave Scunthorpe a ""ghost town"". In 2007, India's Tata conglomerate entered the UK steel market after it bought the Anglo Dutch group, Corus. In 2010, the business was renamed Tata Steel Europe. After a difficult few years, during depths of the 2016 steel crisis, Tata sold the Scunthorpe long products division to private equity firm Greybull Capital for a nominal Â£1. Greybull rebranded the company as British Steel. British Steel's more recent troubles have been linked to a slump in orders from European customers âdue to uncertainty over the Brexit process. It has has also struggled with the weakness of the pound since the EU referendum in June 2016 and the escalating US-China trade war. In a statement on Wednesday, Greybull said: ""The turnaround of British Steel was always going to be a challenge, and yet the business overcame many difficulties and until recently, looked set for renewed prosperity. ""The workforce, the trade unions and the management team have worked closely together in their determination to strengthen the business. However, the additional blows dealt by Brexit-related issues have proven insurmountable."" The High Court appointed accountancy firm EY to the role of Special Manager, assisting the Receiver. EY said the appointment of the Official Receiver followed ""a number of weeks"" of negotiations by management with the company's various stakeholders, including lenders, shareholders and the government, to secure the necessary funding to avoid an insolvency. ""Regrettably, these efforts were unable to secure a solution before the company's funding resources were exhausted."" British Steel customer Network Rail sources 95% of its rails from British Steel's Scunthorpe plant. In a statement, the rail infrastructure operator said it had been working closely with British Steel and the government for ""many weeks"". ""We have done what we can to help ease the company's financial difficulties. We have improved our order book with the company - increasing rail production volumes, bringing orders forward and committing to a long term schedule - as well as offering immediate payment to ease the pressure on cash flow."" It is understood the company has enough stockpiles to keep it going until other suppliers can increase production. Business Secretary Greg Clark said the government had shown its ""willingness to act"", having provided the British Steel with a Â£120m bridging loan in April to meet EU emission rules and avoid a steep fine. However, he added: ""The government can only act within the law, which requires any financial support to a steel company to be on a commercial basis. I have been advised that it would be unlawful to provide a guarantee or loan on the terms of any proposals that the company or any other party has made."" Labour's shadow business secretary, Rebecca Long Bailey, called for the company to be nationalised. She said: ""The government must act quickly to save this strategically important industry and the livelihoods and communities of those who work in it, by bringing British Steel into public ownership.''

"This video can not be played Theresa May says failure to back her deal risks ""no Brexit at all"" Theresa May has said MPs have ""one last chance"" to deliver Brexit, urging them to back what she called a ""new deal"". MPs will get a vote on whether to hold another referendum if they back the EU Withdrawal Agreement Bill, she said. The bill also contains new guarantees on workers' rights, environmental protections and the Northern Irish border, as well a customs ""compromise"". Labour said it was a ""rehash"" of existing plans and Tory Brexiteers took to social media to vent their anger. Jacob Rees-Mogg said,externalwhat was on offer was ""worse than before"", while Boris Johnson said the proposals contravened the party's 2017 general election manifesto, which ruled out the UK remaining in a customs union with the EU. He tweeted,external: ""We can and must do better and deliver what the people voted for."" Is May's 'new' Brexit deal actually new? What 'new deal' means for Irish backstop? MPs have rejected the withdrawal agreement negotiated with the EU three times and attempts to find a formal compromise with Labour also failed. In what is seen as a last roll of the dice, Mrs May is now bringing the Withdrawal Agreement Bill - legislation required to bring the agreement into UK law - to Parliament in early June. In a speech in London,,externalthe PM implored MPs to come together, saying a negotiated exit from the EU would be ""dead in the water"" if they rejected the plan. ""I have compromised, now I ask you to compromise too,"" she said, adding that she had even ""offered to give up the job I love earlier than I would like"". Mrs May said the deadlock over Brexit was having a ""corrosive"" impact on political debate in the country and was stopping progress in other areas. ""The majority of MPs say they want to deliver the result of the referendum... and I believe there is now one last chance to do that,"" she said. The key points of the PM's revised plan are: A guarantee of a Commons vote on whether to hold another referendum on the government's Brexit deal, with a promise to honour the outcome A vote on different customs options, including a government proposal for a temporarycustoms unionfor goods - what Mrs May called a ""customs compromise"" A legal obligation for the UK to ""seek to conclude alternative arrangements"" to replacethe Northern Ireland backstopby the end of 2020 If the backstop does come into force, the bill would guarantee Northern Ireland remains aligned with the rest of the UK and remains in same customs territory Legislation to ensure workers rights are ""every bit as good if not better"" after Brexit and guarantees of no dilution in environmental standards A legal duty to seek changes tothe political declarationon future relations with the EU While she personally opposed another referendum on the terms of Brexit, the PM said she recognised the ""genuine and sincere"" feelings on the issue in Parliament. She urged MPs to back the Withdrawal Agreement Bill at its first parliamentary hurdle and then ""make the case"" for another public vote when the bill was examined in detail later. Did the prime minister just make it worse? It hardly seems that would have been possible. Her agreement with the EU had been sharply kicked out several times by MPs. She'd promised that she would quit and get out of the way if that bought more support. Then she took the risk of talking to the political enemy to try to get a different deal. But those measures failed - leaving her hope this time to dangle a bauble to each of Parliament's different Brexit tribes in the much more extensive plan of how she'd actually put our departure into law. But even before she started talking, many MPs simply weren't listening. Read more from Laura Members of the cabinet, which earlier backed the plan, said they hoped the fresh concessions would galvanise Parliament. International Trade Secretary Liam Fox said it was ""crunch time"" and by backing the bill, MPs would be able to shape ""what sort of Brexit they want"". This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: Bill is ""a rehash of what was discussed before"" But there was an under-whelming reaction from Labour MPs whom the PM was hoping to win over. Lisa Nandy, the Wigan MP who has said she could be persuaded to back a deal which maintained frictionless trade and employment rights, said the offer was ""very weak"". ""What she seems to be offering is for Parliament to go round the same track that we have been round before,"" she said. Brexit: What happens next? Reality Check: Has the time run out for another referendum? And Peter Kyle, who has made his support conditional on a referendum, said Mrs May's promises could easily be reversed by her successor. He said what was being offered was a ""strange complex process"" rather than a ""clean, simple confirmatory ballot on her deal"". This video can not be played Milkshakes, money, MEP sanctions and err more Danish porn. Jeremy Corbyn questioned whether any of it could be delivered given Mrs May had a short time left in office. ""It's basically a rehash of what was discussed before and it doesn't make any fundamental moves on market alignment or the customs union or indeed protection of rights,"" he said. Tory Brexiteers responded with dismay. Conor Burns, a former ministerial aide to Boris Johnson, said the bill should not now be tabled. Allow Twitter content?

"Yusuf Abdi Ali had to leave Canada after a CBC documentary exposed his past A US jury has found that a former Uber driver living in Virginia committed acts of torture during Somalia's civil war in the late 1980s. Somali citizen Farhan Tani Warfaa testified last week in the Washington DC suburbs that ex-Somali colonel Yusuf Abdi Ali shot and tortured him. Ali was a commander in the national army and supporter of dictator Mohamed Siad Barre, say court documents. Until this month, Ali drove for Uber, with a high 4.89 rating. On Tuesday, a jury at a federal court in Alexandria, Virginia, found that Ali was responsible for the torture of Mr Warfaa more than three decades ago, awarding Mr Warfaa $500,000 (Â£395,000) in damages. Mr Warfaa, tortured during the Somali civil war, is ""very happy"" with the verdict Mr Warfaa, who first filed the case against Ali in 2004, told the BBC he was ""very happy"" with the verdict. ""I am very, very satisfied with the outcome,"" Mr Warfaa said through a translator from court. Mr Warfaa said he was kidnapped from his home in northern Somalia by a group of Ali's soldiers in 1987. Over the next several months, Mr Warfaa said he was interrogated, tortured, beaten and shot at the direction of Ali, who was a battalion commander. Left for dead, Mr Warfaa says he only managed to survive by bribing his gravediggers to spare him. Ali was first identified in a 1992 documentary by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, which detailed allegations that Ali had tortured, killed and maimed hundreds of people while working for the Barre regime. At the time of the broadcast, Ali was living in Toronto working as a security guard. In the documentary, multiple eyewitnesses in northern Somalia described brutal murders ordered by Ali, known then as Colonel Tukeh, meaning ""the crow"". Shortly after it aired, Ali was deported from Canada for ""serious human rights abuses"", court documents say. The US also began deportation proceedings against Ali, but he returned to the country in 1996. It is unclear how he was able to re-enter the US. The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Uber 'not criminally liable' for car death Uber driver pleads guilty to kidnapping 'We are thrown to the wolves' In May, CNN reporters went undercover to take an Uber ride with Ali. He told CNN that he drives for rideshares Uber and Lyft full-time, preferring weekend shifts because ""that's where the money is"". Asked if the application process for drivers was difficult, Ali replied that it was simple: ""They just want your background check, that's it."" Ali drove for Uber for about 18 months, after passing a screening process for the rideshare company. The background check included a review of Ali's criminal history using state and national records, and a scan of government watchlists from the FBI and Interpol. He has now been ""permanently removed"" from the app, an Uber spokesperson told the BBC. Mr Warfaa (centre) and members of his legal team celebrate the verdict Lyft spokeswoman Campbell Matthews said the company was ""horrified"" by the allegations against Ali. ""We have permanently banned this driver from our community and stand ready to assist law enforcement with any investigation,"" Ms Matthews said. Background checks for both Uber and Lyft are conducted by Checkr, a consumer reporting agency. Checkr's scanning process varies according to client, but includes ""industry standard sources"" like the national Sex Offender database, FBI watchlist, Interpol watchlist, various US and international sanctions lists, and local and federal criminal court records. ""Under federal law, consumer reporting agencies that process background checks rely on criminal records that have been filed in a court of law rather than unverified sources like Google search results,"" said a Checkr spokesperson to the BBC. ""Most employers don't request background checks that include civil lawsuits between private parties because the information is too subjective to use for a hiring decision."" Before working for Uber and Lyft, Ali worked as a security guard at Dulles International Airport near Washington DC. Tuesday's ruling, in favour of Mr Wafaa, demanded ""heroic amounts of effort,"" said his lawyer, Kathy Roberts. Ms Roberts is part of the Center for Justice and Accountability (CJA), a San Francisco-based nonprofit organisation that seeks to bring alleged war criminals to justice. Much of Mr Warfaa's case, thwarted by delays for over a decade, hinged upon whether Ali could be found guilty by a US court of a crime committed in Somalia. US laws, namely the Torture Victim Protections Act (TVPA), prohibit torture whether it occurs on US soil or overseas, and allows both US citizens and non-citizens to bring claims for torture and extrajudicial killings committed in foreign countries. The TVPA only allows for the finding of civil claims in the US, meaning that lawsuits result in monetary compensation, rather than jail time. When Ali moved to Virginia, he exposed himself to the lawsuit, said Benjamin Klein, another lawyer for Mr Wafaa. Mr Warfaa's case included testimony from a former US ambassador, soldiers who served under Ali, and another victim of the former colonel, as he argued that Ali had directed acts of torture and attempted an extrajudicial killing. The US jury issued a split ruling, finding Ali only guilty of torture. Still, Mr Warfaa is ""absolutely thrilled"", said Mr Klein. ""He's been waiting 31 years for this day.""

"Yusuf Abdi Ali had to leave Canada after a CBC documentary exposed his past A US jury has found that a former Uber driver living in Virginia committed acts of torture during Somalia's civil war in the late 1980s. Somali citizen Farhan Tani Warfaa testified last week in the Washington DC suburbs that ex-Somali colonel Yusuf Abdi Ali shot and tortured him. Ali was a commander in the national army and supporter of dictator Mohamed Siad Barre, say court documents. Until this month, Ali drove for Uber, with a high 4.89 rating. On Tuesday, a jury at a federal court in Alexandria, Virginia, found that Ali was responsible for the torture of Mr Warfaa more than three decades ago, awarding Mr Warfaa $500,000 (Â£395,000) in damages. Mr Warfaa, tortured during the Somali civil war, is ""very happy"" with the verdict Mr Warfaa, who first filed the case against Ali in 2004, told the BBC he was ""very happy"" with the verdict. ""I am very, very satisfied with the outcome,"" Mr Warfaa said through a translator from court. Mr Warfaa said he was kidnapped from his home in northern Somalia by a group of Ali's soldiers in 1987. Over the next several months, Mr Warfaa said he was interrogated, tortured, beaten and shot at the direction of Ali, who was a battalion commander. Left for dead, Mr Warfaa says he only managed to survive by bribing his gravediggers to spare him. Ali was first identified in a 1992 documentary by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, which detailed allegations that Ali had tortured, killed and maimed hundreds of people while working for the Barre regime. At the time of the broadcast, Ali was living in Toronto working as a security guard. In the documentary, multiple eyewitnesses in northern Somalia described brutal murders ordered by Ali, known then as Colonel Tukeh, meaning ""the crow"". Shortly after it aired, Ali was deported from Canada for ""serious human rights abuses"", court documents say. The US also began deportation proceedings against Ali, but he returned to the country in 1996. It is unclear how he was able to re-enter the US. The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Uber 'not criminally liable' for car death Uber driver pleads guilty to kidnapping 'We are thrown to the wolves' In May, CNN reporters went undercover to take an Uber ride with Ali. He told CNN that he drives for rideshares Uber and Lyft full-time, preferring weekend shifts because ""that's where the money is"". Asked if the application process for drivers was difficult, Ali replied that it was simple: ""They just want your background check, that's it."" Ali drove for Uber for about 18 months, after passing a screening process for the rideshare company. The background check included a review of Ali's criminal history using state and national records, and a scan of government watchlists from the FBI and Interpol. He has now been ""permanently removed"" from the app, an Uber spokesperson told the BBC. Mr Warfaa (centre) and members of his legal team celebrate the verdict Lyft spokeswoman Campbell Matthews said the company was ""horrified"" by the allegations against Ali. ""We have permanently banned this driver from our community and stand ready to assist law enforcement with any investigation,"" Ms Matthews said.

"Huawei unveiled new phones powered by ARM-based chips, on Tuesday UK-based chip designer ARM has told staff it must suspend business with Huawei, according to internal documents obtained by the BBC. ARM instructed employees to halt ""all active contracts, support entitlements, and any pending engagementsâ with Huawei and its subsidiaries to comply with a recent US trade clampdown. ARM's designs form the basis of most mobile device processors worldwide. In a company memo, it said its designs contained âUS origin technologyâ. As a consequence, it believes it is affected by the Trump administration's ban. One analyst described the move, if it became long-term, as an âinsurmountableâ blow to Huaweiâs business. He said it would greatly affect the firm's ability to develop its own chips, many of which are currently built with ARMâs underlying technology, for which it pays a licence. These are used in the Chinese company's 5G base stations and computer servers in addition to its smartphones. Cambridge-headquartered ARM had been described as the UK's largest tech firm until its takeover by a Japanese fund. It employs 6,000 workersand lists eight offices in the US,external. In a statement on Wednesday it said: ""ARM is complying with the latest restrictions set forth by the US government and is having ongoing conversations with the appropriate US government agencies to ensure we remain compliant. ""ARM values its relationship with our long-time partner HiSilicon and we are hopeful for a swift resolution on this matter."" Huawei has issued a brief statement of its own. ""We value our close relationships with our partners, but recognise the pressure some of them are under, as a result of politically motivated decisions,"" it said. ""We are confident this regrettable situation can be resolved and our priority remains to continue to deliver world-class technology and products to our customers around the world."" ARM is a chip designer founded in 1990. In September 2016 it was acquired by Japanese telecoms giant Softbank, but remains based in Cambridge, UK. ARM does not manufacture computer processors itself, but rather licenses its semiconductor technologies to others. In some cases, manufacturers only license ARM's architecture, or ""instruction sets"", which determine how processors handle commands. This option gives chip-makers greater freedom to customise their own designs. In other cases, manufacturers license ARM's processor core designs - which describes how the chips' transistors should be arranged. These blueprints still need to be combined with other elements - such as memory and radios - to create what is referred to as a system-on-chip. As a result, when you hear talk of a device being powered by a Samsung Exynos, Qualcomm Snapdragon or Apple A11 chip - or one in a Huawei smartphone - it is still ARM's technology that is involved. ARM's US headquarters are in San Jose, California, and the firm has offices in Washington, Arizona, Texas and Massachusetts. Read more: What is ARM and why was it worth $24bn? ARMâs staff were informed of the decision on 16 May, following the US Commerce Departmentâs move to add Huawei to its âentity listâ of companies with which American firms could no longer do business. The BBC has also seen a company memo dated 18 May detailing the implications of the export ban. Huawei's microchip vulnerability explained Huawei's Android loss: How it affects you Huawei's use of Android restricted by Google On Monday 20 May, US government officialsissued a 90-day reprieve,externalon some of the restrictions in order to minimise immediate disruption. But ARM believes that the temporary licence involved does not apply to it. A spokesman for ARM declined to offer any additional clarity about the current status of its Huawei contracts. A break with ARM would make it difficult for Huawei to develop future generations of its Kirin processors According to one memo, ARM staff were instructed to suspend all interactions with Huawei and its subsidiaries. It advised staff to send a note informing Huawei (or related) employees that due to an âunfortunate situationâ, they were not allowed to âprovide support, delivery technology (whether software, code, or other updates), engage in technical discussions, or otherwise discuss technical matters with Huawei, HiSilicon or any of the other named entitiesâ. ARM staff that come into contact with employees at industry events must âpolitely decline and stopâ any conversations about the business, the guidance said - stressing that individuals could be held personally liable for breaking the trade rules. The ban also appeared to apply to ARM China, the China-based company in which ARM Holdings owns a 49% stake. It was set up as a joint venture with a Chinese investment consortium last year in order to enable ARM to develop, sell and offer support for its products in the region. Huawei told reporters on Tuesday that its âplan Bâ for software would be to develop its own operating system, something it has already been working on for some time. However, it will be significantly more difficult for the firm to source home-grown components of sufficient quality. Huawei currently sources some of its chips from HiSilicon, which it owns. However, while produced in China, HiSiliconâs chips are built using underlying technology created by ARM. While HiSilicon and Huawei are free to carry on using and manufacturing existing chips, the ban would mean the company could no longer turn to ARM for assistance in developing components for devices in future. HiSilicon's upcoming processor, Kirin 985, is due be used in Huawei devices later this year. According to a source at ARM, it is not expected to be affected by the ban. However, the next iteration of the chip has not yet been completed - and is likely to need to be rebuilt from scratch, the source said. Huawei also uses ARM's designs for its recently unveiled Kunpeng chips. These are used to power its TaiShan-series computer servers,which are designed to provide cloud computing and storage to clients,external. In addition, the company told analysts in January that the Tiangang chip at the heart of its 5G base stations is also ARM-based. Huawei's carrier division chief Ryan Ding showed off its 5G base station chip alongside an image saying it involved a ""high-performance ARM-based processor"" ""The problem of the whole telecoms industry is that so much of it is based on the exchange of technology between different companies - whether that's chip companies, software providers or the makers of other hardware,"" commented Alan Burkitt-Gray, editor-at-large of the telecoms news site Capacity Media. He added that Huawei would likely face other problems licensing 5G-related tech from others, and in turn US-based companies would now be unable to licence the Chinese company's 5G inventions. ""This will carve out a chasm in the industry between Huawei-originated intellectual property and the rest of the world's,"" he said. ""It's just a total mess and it's happened at a critical time for the rollout of 5G."" The relationship between ARM and Huawei engineers is tight - earlier this month Huawei announced its intention to build a research centre only 15 minutes from ARMâs headquarters in Cambridge, UK. The latest development follows news that Huawei will lose access to some of Google's Android services ""ARM is the foundation of Huaweiâs smartphone chip designs, so this is an insurmountable obstacle for Huawei,â said Geoff Blaber, from CCS Insight. ""That said, with an abundance of companies in Huaweiâs supply chain already having taken action to comply with the US order, Huaweiâs ability to operate was already severely affected.â What is not yet clear is whether ARM is acting on its own interpretation of the US rules, or whether it has been advised by the Commerce Department. ""If that interpretation is correct, thatâs going to affect every semiconductor company in the world,â remarked analyst Lee Ratliff, from IHS Markit. ""Theyâre not going to be able to easily replace these parts with new, in-house designs - the semiconductor industry in China is nascent.â _______ Additional reporting by Leo Kelion Follow Dave Lee on Twitter@DaveLeeBBC,external Do you have more information about this or any other technology story?

"This video can not be played In Scunthorpe, residents fear the town will ""shut down"" if British Steel collapses The future of 5,000 British Steel workers remains uncertain as its owners continue to lobby for government backing. The UK's second-biggest steel maker had been trying to secure Â£75m in financial support to help it to address ""Brexit-related issues"". If the firm does not get the money it would put 5,000 jobs at risk and endanger 20,000 in the supply chain. Labour hasurged the government to nationalise British Steel. But Treasury sources say the only way nationalisation would be contemplated is if there were credible buyers waiting in the wings. And - says BBC business editor Simon Jack - ""there are no clear candidates to buy a weak company in a challenged sector"". The company's request for emergency support from the government is understood to have been reduced from Â£75m to about Â£30m. In April, British Steelborrowed Â£100m from the governmentto enable it to pay an EU carbon bill, so it could avoid a steep fine. The government said it would leave ""no stone unturned"" in its support for the steel industry. British Steel's main plant is at Scunthorpe, but it also has a site in Teesside. According to think-tank IPPR, allowing British Steel to collapse would lead to Â£2.8bn in lost wages over a 10-year period and cost the government Â£1.1bn in lost revenue and extra benefit payments. Such a decision would also reduce household spending by Â£1.2bn, which would have an impact on the economy. IPPR's chief economist Carys Roberts said: ""We need a UK-wide industrial strategy that supports strong supply chains, including the foundation industries such as steelmaking that manufacture core materials for use in other industries."" Last Thursday, British Steel said it had the backing of shareholders and lenders and that operations were continuing as usual while it sought a ""permanent solution"" from the government to its financial troubles. It is understood that along with administration, nationalisation or a management buyout are being discussed as fall-back options for the company. British Steel's troubles have been linked to a slump in orders from European customers âdue to uncertainty over the Brexit process. The firm has also been struggling with the weakness of the pound since the EU referendum in June 2016 and the escalating trade US-China trade war. One of its biggest customers is Network Rail, 95% of whose rails are supplied by British Steel's Scunthorpe plant. In 2007, India's Tata conglomerate entered the UK steel market when it bought the Anglo-Dutch group, Corus. In 2010, the business was renamed Tata Steel Europe. After a difficult few years, Tata sold the Scunthorpe long products division to private equity firm Greybull Capital for a nominal Â£1. Greybull's rescue came during the depths of the steel crisis in 2016 and saved more than 4,000 jobs. It then rebranded the company as British Steel and recently returned it to profit.

"British Steel has been placed in compulsory liquidation, putting 5,000 jobs at risk and endangering 20,000 in the supply chain. The move follows a breakdown in rescue talks between the government and the company's owner, Greybull. The Government's Official Receiver has taken control of the company as part of the liquidation process. The search for a buyer for British Steel has already begun. In the meantime, it will trade normally. The Official Receiver said British Steel Ltd had been wound up in the High Court and the immediate priority was to continue safe operation of the site. The company was transferred to the Official Receiver because British Steel, its shareholders and the government were not able to, or would not, support the business. That meant the company did not have to funds to pay for an administration. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn and Theresa May clashed over British Steel at PMQs The other companies within the British Steel group are continuing to trade as normal and are not in insolvency. British Steel failure: The role of Greybull What are the EU rules about state aid? The Official Receiver and EY are looking for a buyer for the business. If they fail to find one, the firm would be wound up and redundancies would follow. ""I appreciate that this is a difficult time for the company's employees and I want to thank them for their ongoing co-operation,"" Receiver David Chapman said. ""The company in liquidation is continuing to trade and supply its customers while I consider options for the business. British Steel has about 5,000 employees. There are 3,000 at Scunthorpe, with another 800 on Teesside and in north-eastern England. The rest are in France, the Netherlands and various sales offices round the world. Their wages this week have been paid by Greybull and the government will pick up the bill from now on. Roy Rickhuss, general secretary of the steelworkers' trade union, Community, said: ""This news will heap more worries on workers and everyone connected with British Steel, but it will also end the uncertainty under Greybull's ownership and must be seized as an opportunity to look for an alternative future. ""It is vital now that cool heads prevail and all parties focus on saving the jobs. Kevin Prior, pictured with his partner Kayleigh Manderson, said rumours about the plant had been ""circulating for weeks"" Staff in Scunthorpe havealso reacted. ""Everyone is terrified,"" said steelworker Kevin Prior. The 32-year-old scrap metal cutter has been at the plant since 2015 and his sister and brother-in-law also work at there. He said rumours about the company's future had been circulating for a number of weeks. ""It's just heartbreaking,"" he said. ""It's horrible to hear that my sister is crying herself to sleep because she doesn't know what's going to happen with her husband's job and what that means for them."" As well as the plant's workers the North Lincolnshire town's economy relies heavily on the giant steel works, with an estimated 20,000 jobs linked to the site. Its closure would be a body blow, with some residents claiming it would leave Scunthorpe a ""ghost town"". In 2007, India's Tata conglomerate entered the UK steel market after it bought the Anglo Dutch group, Corus. In 2010, the business was renamed Tata Steel Europe.

""The workforce, the trade unions and the management team have worked closely together in their determination to strengthen the business. However, the additional blows dealt by Brexit-related issues have proven insurmountable."" The High Court appointed accountancy firm EY to the role of Special Manager, assisting the Receiver. EY said the appointment of the Official Receiver followed ""a number of weeks"" of negotiations by management with the company's various stakeholders, including lenders, shareholders and the government, to secure the necessary funding to avoid an insolvency. ""Regrettably, these efforts were unable to secure a solution before the company's funding resources were exhausted."" British Steel customer Network Rail sources 95% of its rails from British Steel's Scunthorpe plant. In a statement, the rail infrastructure operator said it had been working closely with British Steel and the government for ""many weeks"". ""We have done what we can to help ease the company's financial difficulties. We have improved our order book with the company - increasing rail production volumes, bringing orders forward and committing to a long term schedule - as well as offering immediate payment to ease the pressure on cash flow."" It is understood the company has enough stockpiles to keep it going until other suppliers can increase production. Business Secretary Greg Clark said the government had shown its ""willingness to act"", having provided the British Steel with a Â£120m bridging loan in April to meet EU emission rules and avoid a steep fine. However, he added: ""The government can only act within the law, which requires any financial support to a steel company to be on a commercial basis. I have been advised that it would be unlawful to provide a guarantee or loan on the terms of any proposals that the company or any other party has made."" Labour's shadow business secretary, Rebecca Long Bailey, called for the company to be nationalised. She said: ""The government must act quickly to save this strategically important industry and the livelihoods and communities of those who work in it, by bringing British Steel into public ownership.''

"A company which left customers without gas for months has received the largest-ever enforcement action, of Â£44m, from the energy regulator. Ofgem said Cadent also had no records of 775 high-rise blocks of flats. That discovery was in part prompted by an information request from a council in the wake of the Grenfell Tower tragedy. The company offered an ""unreserved apology"" to customers who were without supplies for 19 days on average. ""We aim to put customers' needs at the heart of everything we do, and we acknowledge that in the past, we have fallen short of customers expectations and the higher standards we have now set ourselves; for this, we are sorry,"" said Steve Hurrell, chief executive of Cadent. Cadent, previously known as National Grid Gas Distribution, is involved in the final leg of piping gas into people's homes. It owns four of England's eight regional distribution networks - north London, the West Midlands, the North West of England and eastern England. It did not supply Grenfell, but received an information request from a council  following the tragedy. Many of the customers affected by the gas outage were in north London. Some had their gas cut off for more than five months Jonathan Brearley of Ofgem told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""When they were making repairs, people had their gas cut off for far too long. ""So in London, people in tower blocks were off for an average of 19 days and some were off for several months.  We think this is unacceptable. ""If they do not look after their customers in totality, then absolutely they will either lose their licence or indeed they will suffer further financial penalties."" The penalty takes two parts: Â£24m for improvements and compensation and Â£20m for a community fund, which will receive 1.25% of Cadent's after tax profits. The firm's operating profit last year was Â£724m. The company admitted that its regulatory data supplied to Ofgem showed that it was leaving residents in blocks of flats without gas for longer than necessary. It also reported to Ofgem that it failed, over a six-year period, to compensate up to 12,000 residents left without gas for more than 24 hours. It also reported to the regulator that it did not have records of gas pipes - or risers - in many tower blocks in its London network. As part of the penalty, Cadent - which supplies gas to 11 million properties and 3,347 blocks of at least six storeys - will double compensation payments to customers who experience an unplanned disruption of longer than 24 hours, at a cost of Â£6.7m. It will also pay Â£300,000 - double the amount first envisaged - to 2,140 customers who faced delayed compensation in 2018 and 2019. The Health and Safety Executive is investigating the record-keeping issue and will publish its findings in due course.

"TalkTalk failed to inform 4,545 customers their personal information, including bank account details, were stolen as part of the 2015 data breach. Viewers contacted BBC Watchdog Live about concerns that their details had been breached by TalkTalk. But the company had told them that their details were not compromised. ""The customer data referred to by BBC Watchdog relates to the historicalOctober 2015 data breach. It is not a new incident,"" the firm said. The BBC consumer show investigated and found the personal details of approximately 4,500 customers available online after a Google search. The details included full names, addresses, email addresses, dates of birth, TalkTalk customer numbers, mobile numbers and bank details for thousands of customers. The information is likely to have been online since the breach, without the knowledge of the people affected. The 2015 attack saw personal details of nearly 157,000 customers accessed, including bank account numbers and sort codes of over 15,000 customers. The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) conducted an investigation into the breach, finding multiple failings in TalkTalk's security processes. As a reflection of ""the seriousness of the event"", the ICOissued TalkTalk with a record fine of Â£400,000. When presented with the findings of the BBC investigation, TalkTalk said it was a genuine error and that it has since written to all impacted customers to apologise. ""The 2015 incident impacted 4% of TalkTalk customers and at the time, we wrote to all those impacted,"" the company said in a statement. ""In addition, we wrote to our entire base to inform them about the breach, advise them about the risk of scam calls and offer free credit monitoring to protect against fraud. ""A recent investigation has shown that 4,545 customers may have received the wrong notification regarding this incident. This was a genuine error and we have since written to all those impacted to apologise. 99.9% of customers received the correct notification in 2015. ""On their own, none of the details accessed in the 2015 incident could lead to any direct financial loss."" For the last two years Alan, not his real name, has had his phone, email and bank account bombarded with a series of fraudulent attacks. Whilst Alan will never know if the attacks were a direct result of the TalkTalk data breach, he feels the details leaked are enough to allow fraudsters to impersonate him. The data breach announcement made to customers on the TalkTalk website in October 2015 Alan said he felt ""extremely uncomfortable"" after Watchdog Live showed him that they were able to find his bank account number, sort code and other personal information online. ""I think they've failed their customers on a gigantic scale,"" he added. Watchdog Live also spoke to Maureen, not her real name, who was shocked to discover that her details were breached in 2015. At the time, Maureen was told by TalkTalk that her details had not been stolen. Maureen has been in touch with TalkTalk on multiple occasions, most recently in May of this year, to raise concerns that her details had been compromised. But TalkTalk continued to insist that they hadn't. Watchdog Live's investigation found Maureen's sensitive data through a simple online search. Maureen told the programme: ""I've been asking this question since 2015.  I'm suffering now for something that I know nothing, absolutely nothing, about. ""I knew something was not right and I kept insisting and they avoided every single time I asked the question 'have my details been compromised?'"" ""If the data has come from TalkTalk then obviously we need to go and revisit all of these people who've been told that they weren't exposed and look at what they can do to rectify the harm,"" online security expert Scott Helme told the programme. ""We're never going to completely erase this data, but what we can do is try to reduce the impact of having lost the data."" Personal details can be used by criminals to commit identity theft and fraud Watchdog Live spoke to multiple people who were affected by the TalkTalk data breach. They said they had been subject to frequent scam calls, and in some cases attempted fraud and identity theft, impacting their credit rating. These people may never know if their experiences were a direct result of TalkTalk's data breach, or if their details could have been accessed some other way. Using the information Watchdog found, a fraudster could sign up for services, set up direct debits and purchase goods on their victim's behalf, said Mr Helme. He added that a scammer could also use this information to pretend to be the victim's bank, in order to gain other information about them.

"A top business lobby group representing American firms in China said they have ""real concerns"" over how Beijing may respond to US action taken against Huawei. Speaking to the BBC, AmCham China chairman Tim Stratford said its members were worried about Beijing's response. The US recently added Huawei to its ""entity list"" which puts curbs on its ability to do business in America. The move has escalated existing trade tensions between the US and China. Last week the Trump administration added Huawei to the trade blacklist, which bans the Chinese telecoms giant from acquiring technology from US firms without government approval. China hasthreatened to retaliate against US sanctionswithout giving details. ""Particularly in the wake of the decision to put Huawei on the... entity list, there are concerns that the government of China may decide to retaliate against American companies,"" Mr Stratford said. ""These are real concerns, and they increase the risk as people are considering how they should make adjustments to their business models,"" he said. US-China trade war: What could Beijing do next? Who loses out in the US-China trade war? Shoe giants urge Trump to end trade war His comments came as the American Chambers of Commerce (AmCham) in China and Shanghai released a survey of its members that found that slightly more than 40% had relocated, or were considering moving production facilities, outside of China because of tariffs. The group represents more than 900 US companies working in China. A recent escalation in the US-China trade conflict, including tariff hikes from both sides, has sparked reaction from industries hit by the higher levies. US President Donald Trump increased tariffs on $200bn (Â£157.3bn) worth of Chinese imports into the US from 10% to 25% earlier this month, after Washington and Beijing failed to reach a deal on trade. China retaliated by announcing plans to raise levies on $60bn of US imports from 1 June. On Tuesday, some of the world's biggest footwear firms urged Mr Trump to end the US trade war with China, warning of a ""catastrophic"" effect on consumers. In a letter signed by 173 companies, including Nike and Adidas, they said the president's decision to hike import tariffs to 25% will disproportionately impact the working class. They also warned that higher levies threaten the future of some businesses. ""It is time to bring this trade war to an end,"" the firms urged. When he raised tariffs earlier this month, Mr Trump told companies that they could reduce costs by shifting production to the US. Allow Twitter content?

But they added: ""Footwear is a very capital-intensive industry, with years of planning required to make sourcing decisions, and companies cannot simply move factories to adjust to these changes."" Beijing has signalled some willingness to work with Washington to solve their trade dispute. No discussions have been scheduled since the last round of talks ended on 10 May. ""China remains ready to continue our talks with our American colleagues to reach a conclusion. Our door is still open,"" China's ambassador to the US Cui Tiankai said on Fox News.

"This video can not be played In Scunthorpe, residents fear the town will ""shut down"" if British Steel collapses The future of 5,000 British Steel workers remains uncertain as its owners continue to lobby for government backing. The UK's second-biggest steel maker had been trying to secure Â£75m in financial support to help it to address ""Brexit-related issues"". If the firm does not get the money it would put 5,000 jobs at risk and endanger 20,000 in the supply chain. Labour hasurged the government to nationalise British Steel. But Treasury sources say the only way nationalisation would be contemplated is if there were credible buyers waiting in the wings. And - says BBC business editor Simon Jack - ""there are no clear candidates to buy a weak company in a challenged sector"". The company's request for emergency support from the government is understood to have been reduced from Â£75m to about Â£30m. In April, British Steelborrowed Â£100m from the governmentto enable it to pay an EU carbon bill, so it could avoid a steep fine. The government said it would leave ""no stone unturned"" in its support for the steel industry. British Steel's main plant is at Scunthorpe, but it also has a site in Teesside. According to think-tank IPPR, allowing British Steel to collapse would lead to Â£2.8bn in lost wages over a 10-year period and cost the government Â£1.1bn in lost revenue and extra benefit payments. Such a decision would also reduce household spending by Â£1.2bn, which would have an impact on the economy. IPPR's chief economist Carys Roberts said: ""We need a UK-wide industrial strategy that supports strong supply chains, including the foundation industries such as steelmaking that manufacture core materials for use in other industries."" Last Thursday, British Steel said it had the backing of shareholders and lenders and that operations were continuing as usual while it sought a ""permanent solution"" from the government to its financial troubles. It is understood that along with administration, nationalisation or a management buyout are being discussed as fall-back options for the company. British Steel's troubles have been linked to a slump in orders from European customers âdue to uncertainty over the Brexit process. The firm has also been struggling with the weakness of the pound since the EU referendum in June 2016 and the escalating trade US-China trade war. One of its biggest customers is Network Rail, 95% of whose rails are supplied by British Steel's Scunthorpe plant. In 2007, India's Tata conglomerate entered the UK steel market when it bought the Anglo-Dutch group, Corus. In 2010, the business was renamed Tata Steel Europe. After a difficult few years, Tata sold the Scunthorpe long products division to private equity firm Greybull Capital for a nominal Â£1. Greybull's rescue came during the depths of the steel crisis in 2016 and saved more than 4,000 jobs. It then rebranded the company as British Steel and recently returned it to profit.

"Acting US Defence Secretary Patrick Shanahan said the US had been ""very prudent"" The potential of attacks by Iran has been ""put on hold"" by US counter-measures, acting Defence Secretary Patrick Shanahan has said. The US has warned of a threat from Iran in recent weeks and Mr Shanahan briefed lawmakers at a closed-doors meeting. Tension has risen sharply, with the US deploying military assets to the Gulf to tackle the unspecified threats. On Sunday, President Donald Trump tweeted: ""If Iran wants to fight, that will be the official end of Iran."" He has maintained a strong anti-Iran policy since taking office and last year unilaterally withdrew the US from a nuclear deal with Iran and five world powers. US-Iran tensions explained Why the WhatsApp spies may have eyes on Iran President Trump's National Security Adviser, John Bolton, is a long-standing advocate for regime change in Iran and has previously called for the US to bomb the nation. Speaking to reporters, he said the US ""posture is for deterrence"" rather than war. Mr Shanahan, who addressed lawmakers alongside Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen Joseph Dunford, said: ""I think our steps were very prudent and we've put on hold the potential for attacks on Americans and that's what's extremely important. ""I'd say we're in a period where the threat remains high and our job is to make sure that there is no miscalculation by the Iranians."" He did not publicly share details of the ""credible information"" related to the issue, but added: ""I just hope Iran is listening.  We're in the region to address many things, but it's not to go to war with Iran."" This video can not be played What's behind the rising tensions between the US and Iran? Reports suggested the briefing was heated at times and, after the meeting, some Democrats accused government officials of twisting intelligence information. ""In my opinion, there wasn't any information there that pointed to any reason why we should be engaging in talk of war with Iran,"" said Representative Ruben Gallego. Iran agreed the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) in 2015 to limit the scope of its nuclear programme in return for sanctions relief, and has called on other parties to uphold the deal despite the US withdrawal. But the JCPOA looks to be increasingly under threat. Iranian officials said on Monday that they had increased by fourfold the production of low-enriched uranium - although the increase remains for the moment within the restrictions of the deal. Tensions began rising this month whenthe US ended exemptions from sanctions for countries still buying from Iran. The decision was intended to bring Iran's oil exports to zero, denying the government its main source of revenue. Mr Trump reinstated the sanctions last year after abandoning the nuclear deal. Days after the US withdrawal, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani saidhis country would suspend several commitments under the deal. The White House then announced the US was sending an aircraft carrier, B-52 bombers and a Patriot missile defence battery to the region because of ""troubling and escalatory indications"" related to Iran. Last week,four oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman were damaged in what the United Arab Emirates said were sabotage attackswhile drone attacks on two oil pumping stations in Saudi Arabia by Yemen's Houthi rebels - who are supported by Iran - forced the temporary closure of a pipeline. Iran has denied that it was behind the incidents. But Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said lawmakers at the briefing were told that both cases had been ""co-ordinated and directed by the Iranian government, the ayatollah"". There were also unconfirmed reports, citing US and regional security officials, that Iran had loaded missiles on to boats in Iranian ports and that Iran-backed Iraqi paramilitary fighters had positioned rockets near facilities in Iraq used by US troops. ""I would say to the Iranians: do not underestimate the resolve on the US side,"" UK Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt told reporters in Geneva on Monday. ""They don't want a war with Iran. But if American interests are attacked, they will retaliate."" The USS Abraham Lincoln Carrier Strike Group has been deployed to the Gulf ""We want the situation to de-escalate, because this is a part of the world where things can get triggered accidentally,"" he added. Saudi Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, Adel al-Jubeir, said the kingdom ""does not want a war, is not looking for it and will do everything to prevent it"". ""But at the same time, if the other side chooses war, the kingdom will respond with strength and determination to defend itself and its interests.""

"Two men have been shot dead in separate incidents in County Dublin in less than 24 hours. On Tuesday night, a man was found dead beside a burning car at Rowans Little in Walshestown, near Balbriggan in north County Dublin. He has been identified as as 22-year-old SeÃ¡n Little from Coolock in Dublin. It is understood he was known to gardaÃ­ (Irish police) because of his links with organised crime. According to Irish broadcaster RTÃ, he was an associate of the leader of a Finglas-based organised crime gang, involved in an ongoing feud with a Blanchardstown drugs gang. He also had close links to theKinahan crime gang., RTÃ reports. Police vehicles and investigators at the scene of the first incident in Walshestown GardaÃ­ said he was shot a number of times before his body was discovered at about 23:20 local time. On Wednesday afternoon, a second man was shot dead on the north side of Dublin. He was killed on Marigold Road in the Darndale area at about 16:00 local time. The scene of a fatal shooting in the Darndale area of Dublin Initial reports suggest the victim was known to gardaÃ­ and that the shooting could be drugs related. However, it is not known if the two deaths are connected. A burnt-out car was removed from the scene of the first incident following a forensic examination Shane Harrison, BBC News NI Ireland correspondent In the first incident, the fact that the body was found beside a burnt-out car may suggest the victim was murdered somewhere else and taken to the scene, off the Belfast-to-Dublin motorway, before being dropped from the vehicle near the exit close to Balbriggan. Although it is early in the investigation, detectives are keenly aware of three ongoing gangland feuds: one in Drogheda, a few kilometres north, and another in Blanchardstown in west Dublin - both are over the drugs trade. And then there is the on-going Kinahan-Hutch feud that began in 2015 and is believed to have claimed 17 lives so far.

"TalkTalk failed to inform 4,545 customers their personal information, including bank account details, were stolen as part of the 2015 data breach. Viewers contacted BBC Watchdog Live about concerns that their details had been breached by TalkTalk. But the company had told them that their details were not compromised. ""The customer data referred to by BBC Watchdog relates to the historicalOctober 2015 data breach. It is not a new incident,"" the firm said. The BBC consumer show investigated and found the personal details of approximately 4,500 customers available online after a Google search. The details included full names, addresses, email addresses, dates of birth, TalkTalk customer numbers, mobile numbers and bank details for thousands of customers. The information is likely to have been online since the breach, without the knowledge of the people affected. The 2015 attack saw personal details of nearly 157,000 customers accessed, including bank account numbers and sort codes of over 15,000 customers. The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) conducted an investigation into the breach, finding multiple failings in TalkTalk's security processes. As a reflection of ""the seriousness of the event"", the ICOissued TalkTalk with a record fine of Â£400,000. When presented with the findings of the BBC investigation, TalkTalk said it was a genuine error and that it has since written to all impacted customers to apologise. ""The 2015 incident impacted 4% of TalkTalk customers and at the time, we wrote to all those impacted,"" the company said in a statement. ""In addition, we wrote to our entire base to inform them about the breach, advise them about the risk of scam calls and offer free credit monitoring to protect against fraud. ""A recent investigation has shown that 4,545 customers may have received the wrong notification regarding this incident. This was a genuine error and we have since written to all those impacted to apologise. 99.9% of customers received the correct notification in 2015. ""On their own, none of the details accessed in the 2015 incident could lead to any direct financial loss."" For the last two years Alan, not his real name, has had his phone, email and bank account bombarded with a series of fraudulent attacks. Whilst Alan will never know if the attacks were a direct result of the TalkTalk data breach, he feels the details leaked are enough to allow fraudsters to impersonate him. The data breach announcement made to customers on the TalkTalk website in October 2015 Alan said he felt ""extremely uncomfortable"" after Watchdog Live showed him that they were able to find his bank account number, sort code and other personal information online. ""I think they've failed their customers on a gigantic scale,"" he added. Watchdog Live also spoke to Maureen, not her real name, who was shocked to discover that her details were breached in 2015. At the time, Maureen was told by TalkTalk that her details had not been stolen. Maureen has been in touch with TalkTalk on multiple occasions, most recently in May of this year, to raise concerns that her details had been compromised. But TalkTalk continued to insist that they hadn't. Watchdog Live's investigation found Maureen's sensitive data through a simple online search. Maureen told the programme: ""I've been asking this question since 2015.  I'm suffering now for something that I know nothing, absolutely nothing, about. ""I knew something was not right and I kept insisting and they avoided every single time I asked the question 'have my details been compromised?'"" ""If the data has come from TalkTalk then obviously we need to go and revisit all of these people who've been told that they weren't exposed and look at what they can do to rectify the harm,"" online security expert Scott Helme told the programme. ""We're never going to completely erase this data, but what we can do is try to reduce the impact of having lost the data."" Personal details can be used by criminals to commit identity theft and fraud Watchdog Live spoke to multiple people who were affected by the TalkTalk data breach. They said they had been subject to frequent scam calls, and in some cases attempted fraud and identity theft, impacting their credit rating. These people may never know if their experiences were a direct result of TalkTalk's data breach, or if their details could have been accessed some other way. Using the information Watchdog found, a fraudster could sign up for services, set up direct debits and purchase goods on their victim's behalf, said Mr Helme. He added that a scammer could also use this information to pretend to be the victim's bank, in order to gain other information about them.

"""I know he wanted to kill me,"" Robert Piersant told the court about his attacker An American tourist who was stabbed in the head, face and back in the London Bridge attack has paid tribute to those who saved him after ""flatlining twice"". Speaking at the inquests into deaths of eight victims, Robert Piersant singled out a Metropolitan Police officer. He said PC Sam Philpot ""never left my side"" after the attack on 3 June 2017. He told the Old Bailey: ""The doctors did great things putting me back together but if it wasn't for that PC I would not have got to the hospital."" London Bridge attack: What happened Victims of the London Bridge attack Mr Piersant and his wife Joyce, who was stabbed but also survived, were among the 48 people injured when Khuram Butt, 27, Rachid Redouane, 30, and Youssef Zaghba, 22, launched a van and knife attack in 2017. The first 10 days of the inquests focused on the eight people killed in the first few minutes of the attack. The hearing has now begun to look into the next phase of the attack - as Redouane, Butt and Zaghba continued stabbing people in bars, restaurants and on streets in the Borough Market area. Returning to London to give evidence at the inquests, Mr Piersant explained that when he was first approached by an attacker, he initially thought he had been barged into by a drunk - but then he saw a knife. ""As I pushed him back, I'm looking at him. He started looking back towards me. He had an angry look,"" he said. ""When he took a step towards me, I took a step back. That's when I felt something at my left waist and that's when I blacked out."" Mr Piersant, from Colorado Springs, was visiting his daughter and her husband in London that summer and had been to dinner that evening with his wife and his son. by Alice Evans, BBC News, at the inquests Joyce Piersant said when she first glimpsed the pink knife in the hand of one of the attackers, she thought the bright colour meant it was just a toy. The court held its breath as her statement described two of the men landing blows on her husband, Robert, before one of them rounded on her. ''[The knifeman] looked me in the eye and hesitated. I would describe him as having questioning eyes,'' her statement said. He then stabbed her in the throat. ''I know he wanted to kill me. I can't explain why... it was in his eyes,'' she recalled. The couple, who had spent the day sightseeing around the capital, survived the attack. The packed public gallery listened in stunned silence as Mr Piersant described the moment he realised he had no pulse after being stabbed in the back and the head. After the judge thanked Mr Piersant for his evidence, the survivor asked to say one more thing. His voice catching with emotion, he thanked the medics and police officers who worked to revive him - including one officer who threw himself across Mr Piersant when they heard bursts of gunfire. The hearing was told that Mr Piersant was taken to hospital in an ambulance, but he did not have a pulse. ""I remember that very vividly, just like you hear on TV. I didn't have a pulse, I didn't have breaths. I recall flatlining twice,"" he said. The court also heard from Gerard Vowls, who chased after the attackers throwing a chair, pint glasses and bottles. Mr Vowls said he had been watching the Champions League final earlier in the evening when he saw a young woman being stabbed repeatedly by the three terrorists, who had an expression of ""hatred"". Gerard Vowls threw a chair, pint glasses and bottles at the attackers He broke down in court as he recalled her pleas for help. ""That is the worst part. That's what gives me the nightmares. She kept saying, 'help, help me',"" he said. ""I heard one of them say 'This is for Allah'."" Mr Vowls said he ran after the attackers, swearing at them, calling them ""cowards"" and saying: ""Come and get me."" ""I don't think they were taking any notice of me,"" he said, describing the attackers as ""jogging left and right"" looking for victims. Mr Vowls told the court he hoped to distract the men away from the people they were attacking and lure them into an area where they could be shot by armed police. CCTV images showed him picking up a chair and throwing it at Butt, and he said he later grabbed pint glasses and bottles from outside the Wheatsheaf pub, shouting ""terrorist cowards"" as he threw them. His makeshift weapons missed. Instead, he tried to warn people inside the Black and Blue restaurant by gesturing through the glass front, but he said at least two people were stabbed when the attackers went inside. Mr Vowls went to look for police help. But then he heard the shots from police marksmen and saw the three attackers lying dead. Xavier Thomas, 45, Christine Archibald, 30, Sara Zelenak, 21, Sebastien Belanger, 36, James McMullan, 32, Kirsty Boden, 28, Alexandre Pigeard, 26, and Ignacio Echeverria, 39, were all killed in the attack, which was brought to an end in less than 10 minutes when the attackers were shot.

"In a bid to limit ocean pollution, the UK government will introduce new controls on single use plastic items next year. The measures cover plastic straws, plastic drinks stirrers and plastic cotton buds in England from April 2020. Only plastic drinks stirrers will be totally banned from sale - currently 316 million are used a year. Environmental groups have praised the move but say the government needs to take far more decisive action. The government press release announcing the new restrictions talks of ""a ban on the supply of plastic straws"" but in reality the aim is instead to restrict their availability. Plastic straw and cotton bud ban proposed The last (plastic) straw: Who's banning them? Disabled people 'need plastic straws' Shops including supermarkets will not be allowed to sell the straws but they will on sale by registered pharmacies in stores and online. That's because disabled groups have highlighted how straws are essential for everyday life and that a total ban could lead to the risk of dehydration. Plastic-stemmed cotton buds will still be available for use in laboratories and by forensic scientists According to the announcement, bars and restaurants will not be allowed to display plastic straws or automatically hand them out but they will be able to provide them if people ask. When asked who could request a straw, a spokesperson for the environment ministry Defra said: ""Anyone can ask for a straw and be given one without needing to prove a disability - we've been working with disabled groups so that they don't feel stigmatised."" Plastic stirrers will be subject to a total ban. However plastic-stemmed cotton buds, although restricted from general sale to the public, will still be available. Medical and scientific laboratories will be able to buy them for use in research and for forensic tasks in criminal investigations. Defra reckons 1.8bn plastic-stemmed cotton buds are used and thrown away every year in England. The government has been considering action on single-use plastic items since the public reaction to David Attenborough's landmark Blue Planet II documentaries nearly two years ago. At the time, Environment Secretary Michael Gove described being haunted by the image of marine life harmed by plastic and launched consultations on a series of measures to curb single-use items. As part of today's announcement that controls would come into effect next April, Mr Gove said: ""These items are often used for just a few minutes but take hundreds of years to break down, ending up in our seas and oceans and harming precious marine life. This video can not be played Five ways to break up with plastic ""So today I am taking action to turn the tide on plastic pollution, and ensure we leave our environment in a better state for future generations."" This comes as Scotland is also taking steps to restrict or ban plastic straws, and plastic-stemmed cotton buds. The Welsh government has also been considering similar measures. Earlier this week the European Union formally adopted a plan to ban a longer list of items including plastic straws, plastic cutlery and plastic plates by 2021. Green groups say they are pleased that the government is taking action but many are critical that the measures do not go further. WWF called for a ban on all ""avoidable single-use plastic"" by 2025 and said ministers needed ""to really ramp up their commitments"". The Marine Conservation Society, which said it found on average 17 cotton buds for every 100m of beach in England, said Mr Gove needed to do more to reduce plastic consumption and increase recycling rates. The Campaign to Protect Rural England (CPRE) said Mr Gove should phase out single-use items altogether and warned that replacements made with alternative materials might still be harmful. The move comes as many takeaway restaurants are already introducing biodegradable alternatives.

"This video can not be played In Scunthorpe, residents fear the town will ""shut down"" if British Steel collapses Labour has urged the government to nationalise British Steel in order to protect jobs and the steel industry. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the collapse of British Steel would have a ""devastating impact"" on Scunthorpe. British Steel is on the verge of administration as it continues to lobby for government backing, sources say. The UK's second-biggest steel maker had been trying to secure Â£75m in financial support to help it to address ""Brexit-related issues"". If the firm does not get the cash it would put 5,000 jobs at risk and endanger 20,000 in the supply chain. ""If an agreement cannot be struck with British Steel, the government must act to take a public stake in the company to secure the long term future of the steelworks and protect peoples' livelihoods and communities,"" said Mr Corbyn. The government said it would leave ""no stone unturned"" in its support for the steel industry. British Steel's main plant is at Scunthorpe, but it also has a site in Teesside. Are you a British Steel worker? Please emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external What are the EU rules about state aid? Speaking in the House of Commons, Business Minister Andrew Stephenson said: ""I can reassure the House that, subject to strict legal bounds, the government will leave no stone unturned in its support for the steel industry."" UK Steel's director general, Gareth Stace, said: ""The statement from the business minister today provided a glimmer of hope for the Scunthorpe site. ""This does provide some breathing space for the company, its employees, and the wider steel sector, providing a potential route towards a stable and sustainable future."" The request for emergency financial support from the government is understood to have been reduced from Â£75m to about Â£30m. In April, British Steel borrowed Â£100m from the government to enable it to pay an EU carbon bill, so it could avoid a steep fine. Reports have said that British Steel shareholder Greybull Capital and lenders have agreed to pump new money into the firm. However, unless a deal is reached by Tuesday afternoon, the firm could go into administration within 48 hours. EY would be expected to be appointed as administrators on Wednesday. If a company goes into administration, then the insolvency practitioners appointed to run the business will try to rescue it by selling it, or parts of it, as a going concern. But if that is not possible it will be liquidated, meaning that it will be closed down and its saleable assets will be sold. For staff in Scunthorpe, it's a waiting game. This video can not be played 'They're all quite scared' The BBC's consumer affairs correspondent Colletta Smith spoke to a British Steel staff member who was too worried to be named. He said that two of his colleagues have just got mortgages and are petrified they won't be able to make payments. News that the company is in trouble isn't a surprise though, as there are piles of finished steel on the factory floor, with no customers to send it to, he said. ""We're doing a bit at work, but it's mostly sitting around doing nothing as the orders just aren't there"". He said staff feel let down by the owners. ""They've just stripped this company and now they're putting nothing back. Our only hope is a government bailout, but this time it feels different. I don't think they'll save us."" Sources close to Greybull Capital say its lenders have told them that unless they can secure a Â£30m lifeline they will pull the plug on British Steel tomorrow. The timing of this could hardly be worse for the government coming as it does right before the European elections. Cynics might suggest that Greybull is not unhappy with the timescale of the plea. Business Secretary Greg Clark has avery tough decision, as I've already written. The question may be whether the government can put this down to Brexit mitigation and tap the same source of contingency funds Chris Grayling disastrously used to procure emergency ferry capacity. At least there would be an immediate dividend - to stave off the collapse of a firm that employs 4,500 people directly and has 20,000 more at risk in the supply chain. However, having already lent Â£100m to cover a genuinely Brexit-related carbon emissions bill - further assistance to a private company struggling in a deeply challenged industry may be a precedent they would rather not set. Last Thursday, British Steel said it had the backing of shareholders and lenders and that operations were continuing as usual while it sought a ""permanent solution"" from the government to its financial troubles. It is understood that along with administration, nationalisation or a management buyout are being discussed as fall-back options for the company. British Steel's troubles have been linked to a slump in orders from European customers âdue to uncertainty over the Brexit process. The firm has also been struggling with the weakness of the pound since the EU referendum in June 2016 and the escalating trade US-China trade war. One of its biggest customers is Network Rail, 95% of whose rails are supplied by British Steel's Scunthorpe plant. In 2007, India's Tata conglomerate entered the UK steel market after it bought the Anglo Dutch group, Corus. In 2010, the business was renamed Tata Steel Europe. After a difficult few years, Tata sold the Scunthorpe long products division to private equity firm Greybull Capital for a nominal Â£1. Greybull's rescue came during the depths of the steel crisis in 2016 and saved more than 4,000 jobs. It then rebranded the company as British Steel and recently returned it to profit. On Monday, the government, trade unions and employers signed a UK Steel Charter in Parliament.  The charter calls on the government and large companies to buy British to boost UK industry.

"This video can not be played In Scunthorpe, residents fear the town will ""shut down"" if British Steel collapses The future of 5,000 British Steel workers remains uncertain as its owners continue to lobby for government backing. The UK's second-biggest steel maker had been trying to secure Â£75m in financial support to help it to address ""Brexit-related issues"". If the firm does not get the money it would put 5,000 jobs at risk and endanger 20,000 in the supply chain. Labour hasurged the government to nationalise British Steel. But Treasury sources say the only way nationalisation would be contemplated is if there were credible buyers waiting in the wings. And - says BBC business editor Simon Jack - ""there are no clear candidates to buy a weak company in a challenged sector"". The company's request for emergency support from the government is understood to have been reduced from Â£75m to about Â£30m.

The government said it would leave ""no stone unturned"" in its support for the steel industry. British Steel's main plant is at Scunthorpe, but it also has a site in Teesside. According to think-tank IPPR, allowing British Steel to collapse would lead to Â£2.8bn in lost wages over a 10-year period and cost the government Â£1.1bn in lost revenue and extra benefit payments. Such a decision would also reduce household spending by Â£1.2bn, which would have an impact on the economy. IPPR's chief economist Carys Roberts said: ""We need a UK-wide industrial strategy that supports strong supply chains, including the foundation industries such as steelmaking that manufacture core materials for use in other industries.""

"This video can not be played Theresa May says failure to back her deal risks ""no Brexit at all"" Theresa May has said MPs have ""one last chance"" to deliver Brexit, urging them to back what she called a ""new deal"". MPs will get a vote on whether to hold another referendum if they back the EU Withdrawal Agreement Bill, she said. The bill also contains new guarantees on workers' rights, environmental protections and the Northern Irish border, as well a customs ""compromise"". Labour said it was a ""rehash"" of existing plans and Tory Brexiteers took to social media to vent their anger. Jacob Rees-Mogg said,externalwhat was on offer was ""worse than before"", while Boris Johnson said the proposals contravened the party's 2017 general election manifesto, which ruled out the UK remaining in a customs union with the EU. He tweeted,external: ""We can and must do better and deliver what the people voted for."" Is May's 'new' Brexit deal actually new? What 'new deal' means for Irish backstop? MPs have rejected the withdrawal agreement negotiated with the EU three times and attempts to find a formal compromise with Labour also failed. In what is seen as a last roll of the dice, Mrs May is now bringing the Withdrawal Agreement Bill - legislation required to bring the agreement into UK law - to Parliament in early June. In a speech in London,,externalthe PM implored MPs to come together, saying a negotiated exit from the EU would be ""dead in the water"" if they rejected the plan. ""I have compromised, now I ask you to compromise too,"" she said, adding that she had even ""offered to give up the job I love earlier than I would like"". Mrs May said the deadlock over Brexit was having a ""corrosive"" impact on political debate in the country and was stopping progress in other areas. ""The majority of MPs say they want to deliver the result of the referendum... and I believe there is now one last chance to do that,"" she said. The key points of the PM's revised plan are: A guarantee of a Commons vote on whether to hold another referendum on the government's Brexit deal, with a promise to honour the outcome A vote on different customs options, including a government proposal for a temporarycustoms unionfor goods - what Mrs May called a ""customs compromise"" A legal obligation for the UK to ""seek to conclude alternative arrangements"" to replacethe Northern Ireland backstopby the end of 2020 If the backstop does come into force, the bill would guarantee Northern Ireland remains aligned with the rest of the UK and remains in same customs territory Legislation to ensure workers rights are ""every bit as good if not better"" after Brexit and guarantees of no dilution in environmental standards A legal duty to seek changes tothe political declarationon future relations with the EU While she personally opposed another referendum on the terms of Brexit, the PM said she recognised the ""genuine and sincere"" feelings on the issue in Parliament. She urged MPs to back the Withdrawal Agreement Bill at its first parliamentary hurdle and then ""make the case"" for another public vote when the bill was examined in detail later. Did the prime minister just make it worse? It hardly seems that would have been possible. Her agreement with the EU had been sharply kicked out several times by MPs. She'd promised that she would quit and get out of the way if that bought more support. Then she took the risk of talking to the political enemy to try to get a different deal. But those measures failed - leaving her hope this time to dangle a bauble to each of Parliament's different Brexit tribes in the much more extensive plan of how she'd actually put our departure into law. But even before she started talking, many MPs simply weren't listening.

International Trade Secretary Liam Fox said it was ""crunch time"" and by backing the bill, MPs would be able to shape ""what sort of Brexit they want"". This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: Bill is ""a rehash of what was discussed before"" But there was an under-whelming reaction from Labour MPs whom the PM was hoping to win over. Lisa Nandy, the Wigan MP who has said she could be persuaded to back a deal which maintained frictionless trade and employment rights, said the offer was ""very weak"". ""What she seems to be offering is for Parliament to go round the same track that we have been round before,"" she said. Brexit: What happens next? Reality Check: Has the time run out for another referendum? And Peter Kyle, who has made his support conditional on a referendum, said Mrs May's promises could easily be reversed by her successor. He said what was being offered was a ""strange complex process"" rather than a ""clean, simple confirmatory ballot on her deal"". This video can not be played Milkshakes, money, MEP sanctions and err more Danish porn. Jeremy Corbyn questioned whether any of it could be delivered given Mrs May had a short time left in office. ""It's basically a rehash of what was discussed before and it doesn't make any fundamental moves on market alignment or the customs union or indeed protection of rights,"" he said. Tory Brexiteers responded with dismay. Conor Burns, a former ministerial aide to Boris Johnson, said the bill should not now be tabled. Allow Twitter content?

"Are Twitter bots controlled by Russia on the march across Europe? And is Facebook full of misinformation designed to influence voters? As the EU elections approach, researchers have been looking at the role that social networks are playing, and their early cautious verdict is that the level of misuse is relatively low. Research by the Oxford Internet Institute found that what Ã­t called ""junk news"" was far less prevalent on Twitter and Facebook than stories from reliable news sources. However, the study of the kind of information social media users are sharing across seven languages ahead of the vote, did find that individual junk news stories were more likely to be shared on Facebook than the work of mainstream news organisations. Separate research for the BBC by a University of Birmingham expert showed an uptick of apparent Twitter bot creation in early May, with some accounts tweeting on Brexit themes thousands of times. But Prof Oleksandr Talavera says that Twitter has become much more effective at spotting and closing accounts which break its rules. Some suspicious accounts with high volumes of tweeting have been suspended. The Oxford study found that under 4% of stories on Twitter came from junk news sources, defined as outlets publishing deliberately misleading, deceptive or incorrect information. That figure did, however, rise to 21% in Poland. But on Facebook, while mainstream news was more visible, stories from junk news sources proved far more engaging. In English, for example, the average junk news story got four times as many likes and other Facebook interactions as a story from a professional news organisation. Junk news which proved popular included suggestions that a Dutch politician wanted a halal beach in The Hague, a story that a Muslim girl had been killed by her family and dumped in a river for being too ""Westernised"", and a report that Vladimir Putin had offered financial assistance to rebuild Notre Dame Cathedral. But the study does not point the finger at Russia for spreading misinformation. ""Almost none of the junk we found circulating online came from known Russian sources"", says Nahema Marchal, co-author of the report ""Instead, it is homegrown, hyper-partisan and alternative media that dominate."" There have been reports of an upswing of automated Twitter accounts - or bots - in the run-up to this week's European elections, so we asked Prof Talavera, who has examined the bot phenomenon, to take a look. He found a spike in the creation of new Twitter accounts tweeting on Brexit and similar themes around 11 May. Many of the accounts consisted of a name followed by eight numbers and tweeted very frequently. One account, @johnie76662158, followed nobody but had tweeted more than 1,300 times in the 10 days after it was created, almost exclusively retweets of Brexit-related material, support for Tommy Robinson and some comments on American politics. Prof Talavera admits it is very hard to decide exactly which accounts are bots, especially as their creators are getting much smarter at understanding how Twitter detects them. But he says ""based on very rough estimation about 20-25% of newly-created users who talk about political outcome are likely to be bots. However, these numbers seem to be very small compared to the existing Twitter universe"". By Monday, the @johnie76662158 account had a message saying it was ""temporarily restricted"" because there had been some ""unusual activity."" Other accounts with high volumes of tweeting have been suspended. Both Twitter and Facebook have set up teams to monitor activity on their platforms in the run-up to the European elections. So far, it appears they have not detected the level of interference from Russian sources or the waves of automated spam tweets seen during the US presidential election and the EU referendum vote in 2016. But both platforms have proved they have enormous power to intervene in the democratic process. That means that in every election from now on they will be under the spotlight.

"Mr Oliver shot to fame 20 years ago Celebrity chef Jamie Oliver has said he is ""devastated"" after his restaurant group went into administration, with 1,000 jobs being lost. The group, which includes the Jamie's Italian chain, Barbecoa and Fifteen, has appointed KPMG as administrators. Twenty two of the 25 restaurants in Jamie Oliver's restaurant group have now closed. Mr Oliver, who put in Â£4m cash this year, said: ""I appreciate how difficult this is for everyone affected."" Two Jamie's Italian restaurants and Jamie Oliver's Diner at Gatwick Airport will continue to trade in the short term while the administrators explore options for the outlets. ""The group had recently undertaken a process to secure additional investment into the business and, since the beginning of this year, Jamie Oliver has made available additional funds of Â£4m to support the fundraising,"" said the administrators in a statement. ""However, with no suitable investment forthcoming and in light of the very difficult current trading environment, the directors resolved to appoint administrators."" Jamie Oliver's Fifteen Cornwall at Watergate Bay, which operates under a franchise, is unaffected.  The international restaurants trading as Jamie's Italian, Jamie's Pizzeria and Jamie's Deli will also continue to trade as normal. Mr Oliver tweeted that: ""I'm devastated that our much-loved UK restaurants have gone into administration."" And in a statement he added: ""I would also like to thank all the customers who have enjoyed and supported us over the last decade, it's been a real pleasure serving you. ""We launched Jamie's Italian in 2008 with the intention of positively disrupting mid-market dining in the UK High Street, with great value and much higher quality ingredients, best-in-class animal welfare standards and an amazing team who shared my passion for great food and service. And we did exactly that."" This video can not be played Jamie Oliver restaurant worker 'devastated' Notices have appeared in the windows of the 22 branches which have already closed. The Unite union said the development was a ""devastating blow for the chain's hardworking and loyal workforce"". ""Restaurants are not being helped by the current economic uncertainty, although those businesses like Jamie Oliver's that dashed for expansion in recent years seem particularly precarious.  As ever, it is the workers at the restaurant and in the supply chain who bear the heavy cost of boardroom decisions."" The union also asked for assurances that staff will be ""protected and paid all the money they're owed, including wages, holiday and redundancy"". One Jamie's Italian worker in Birmingham, Valentine Balbinot, said: ""It was just so devastating, we were not expecting this... it is really brutal."" Mr Oliver is known for his Naked Chef books and TV shows, broadcast in dozens of countries, after first being shown in the UK 20 years ago. He has also campaigned for healthier eating, including in school meals. His chain is the latest victim of a tough trading environment on the UK High Street. Earlier this year, cafe chain Patisserie Valerie fell into administration, and 70 outlets closed, with the loss of 920 jobs, although 96 shops were saved. Other mid-market chains that have struggled in recent years have included Byron Burger, Prezzo and Carluccio's. Mr Oliver's business has faced difficulties over the past two years, with a number of Jamie's Italian and Barbecoa restaurants shutting. Closed notices have been posted on a number of outlets, including Jamie's in Glasgow In 2017, he closed the last of his Union Jacks restaurants and also shut his magazine Jamie, which had been running for almost 10 years. In December of that year the chef also put Â£3m of his own money into his restaurant businesses. Simon Mydlowski, a partner at law firm Gordons and an expert in the hospitality industry, said Jamie's had failed to keep up with changing trends. ""To be successful in this sector you have to be constantly evolving - from the menus and the drinks choice, to the way you engage with customers."" ""Faced with higher rent, rising food prices and increased competition, restaurants need a point of difference - it's no coincidence that smaller brands with the freedom and flexibility to keep things fresh are currently the ones performing well.""
