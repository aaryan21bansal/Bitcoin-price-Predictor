"Claudia Webbe made several threatening phone calls over a two-year period, Westminster Magistrates' Court heard Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has called for Claudia Webbe to resign following her harassment conviction. The former Labour MP for Leicester East, who is now independent,was given a suspended jail sentence on Thursday. Webbe, who was jealous of her partner Lester Thomas's relationship with Michelle Merritt, threatened an acid attack and to share nude images of her. Sir Keir said Webbe, 56, ""should stand down [as an MP] and if she doesn't we will support a recall petition"". Speaking on the Andrew Marr Show, Sir Keir said Labour would push for such a petition to force a by-election if she did not quit the Commons. ""When Claudia Webbe was charged the Labour Party suspended her,"" he said. ""When she was then convicted, we didn't argue with the conviction, we expelled her from the Labour Party. ""We now say she she should resign and we would support a recall petition."" Webbe says she is still with her partner Lester Thomas A recall petition - where Webbe's constituents would be asked if they want to replace her - would trigger a by-election if at least 10% of constituents supported it. However, it can only be opened once all appeals have been extinguished and the conviction is not overturned. Webbe said she was appealing against her conviction, adding she was ""surprised"" the Labour Party had  not waited until the conclusion of the legal process before expelling her. In a statement, she said: ""I am very disappointed bythe decision of the magistrateand want to strongly reiterate that I am innocent. ""I fully expect the appeal to be granted and that, ultimately, it will be successful."" Sir Keir Starmer wants Webbe to quit the Commons, he told Andrew Marr Webbe was elected as Leicester East MP in December 2019, succeeding Keith Vaz. The month before the veteran MP hadannounced he would be retiring from Parliament, a decision that came soon after a Commons standards commission found he had ""expressed willingness"" to buy cocaine for others. She has also worked as a Labour councillor in Islington, north London, where she lives. Follow BBC East Midlands onFacebook,external,Twitter,external, orInstagram,external.

"This video can not be played Adding doors to supermarket fridges might have a bigger impact than you'd expect The UK could cut its total electricity usage by 1% if the top five British supermarkets put doors on fridges, campaigners have said. Aldi has pledged to put fridge doors in all of its new UK stores, saving 2,000 tonnes of carbon a year. Other supermarkets say they will try to make open fridges more efficient. But the Environmental Investigation Agency said supermarkets could cut theirelectricity bills by an average of 33%,externalby adding doors. Each of Aldi's 100 new stores will save 20 tonnes of carbon per year by having doors on fridges, the German chain said, adding it would reduce stores' energy consumption by 20%. The best climate solution you've never heard of Solar fridge firm set for role in Covid-19 fight Why supermarket chiller aisles may soon not be so chilly Glamorgan Cricketer and environmental campaigner Joe Cooke says all supermarkets operating in Wales should follow suit. Supermarket chain Aldi estimates stores with fridge doors will use 20% less electricity ""It's such a simple change,"" Cooke said. ""It could save so much energy, that's going to be so important for us as we try to decarbonise and make the changes to become a greener country."" Cooke said only the Co-op and Aldi had committed to fridge doors in all their new and newly refurbished stores. Mary Dunn, Aldi UK's managing director of corporate responsibility, said: ""Introducing fridge doors is another step on that journey to reduce our energy consumption and we hope that customers enjoy the new, more sustainable shopping experience."" But Tesco, Sainsbury's, Morrisons, Waitrose and M&S all said they would be using ""air wall"" technologies that force cold air towards the back of open displays to save energy. Lidl said is uses curtains when its stores are closed and Asda said it would be trialling doors on chilled displays in 2022. Instead of adding doors, many big supermarkets say they will try to make open fridges more efficient Ulla Lindberg, a refrigeration and consumer researcher from Swedish fridge maker Haglund Industry, said fridges with doors outperform even the most efficient open cabinet technology. Ms Lindberg's research,externalfound food shoppers were not turned off by doors, with many feeling the food was fresher. Supermarkets with fridge doors also saw less food waste and allowed supermarkets to cut their heating bills in winter because they need less heat in the chilled sections of their stores, Ms Lindberg said. Ulla Lindberg's research found shoppers were not turned off by fridge doors ""Half of the energy in a supermarket is from the refrigeration so that means that you cut a lot [with doors],"" she explained. ""You can also improve the situation for the consumer and the food as well."" The then Welsh Assembly's petitions committee considereda campaign to ban open refrigerators in supermarkets in 2019,external, but members concluded the Welsh government did not have the powers to intervene. The UK government ruled out a ban on the use of open fridges and freezers in retail outlets in 2019 and said it was already taking action to improve energy efficiency. In a statement, the the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said it was ""looking at various ways to encourage greater energy efficiency in commercial refrigeration"". ""We urge retailers to increase their use of energy-efficient technology wherever possible,"" it added.

"About 100,000 people marched through the streets of Glasgow on Saturday Police have praised the majority of ""good natured"" marchers who took part in one of Glasgow's largest protests in memory. About 100,000 took part in the procession from Kelvingrove Park to Glasgow Green on Saturday. Officers made 22 arrests - one after a socialist group were contained and the rest after protesters chained themselves on a bridge. Crowds swiftly dispersed after speeches concluded leaving little litter behind. Police later told the BBC there were no major incidents following the event. Officers said people taking part were mostly ""good natured"" and in ""high spirits"" The march was organised by the COP26 Coalition - a network of social and environmental groups in the UK - as part of a Global Day of Action for Climate Justice. It started at Kelvingrove Park in the west of the city and Queen's Park in the south at about midday and made its way along a pre-agreed three-mile route to Glasgow Green. About 100 climate change demonstrations were held in other parts of the UK while events were also taking place in a further 100 countries including Kenya, Turkey, France, Brazil, Australia and Canada. The COP26 Coalition are also running a ""People's Summit"" programme of events from 7-10 November where members of the climate justice movement will meet to ""strategise for system change"". Away from the march at about 11:00, 21 protesters fromScientist Rebellion,externalchained themselves together on the King George V Bridge in Glasgow city centre, resulting in a road closure. Charlie Gardner, an associate senior lecturer at Durell Institute of Conservation and Ecology, said scientists could not ""rely on our leaders to save us anymore"" and had a ""moral duty to act"". Police said 21 people were arrested following the incident and were released on an undertaking. Meanwhile, officers surrounded a group of activists from the Young Communist League (YCL) during the march on St Vincent Street - police said this was because pyrotechnics had been set off and the group's behaviour had ""deteriorated"". Assistant Chief Constable Gary Ritchie told the BBC they group were ""trying to create confrontation"" with officers, were acting ""violently"" and were stopping which ""created a public safety issue"". The group were removed from the procession and one person was then arrested. This video can not be played Officers surrounded a group of activists at one point during the march Some have criticised the policing of the march, with the COP26 Coalition describing the ""kettling"" as  ""heavy-handed and disproportionate"". On Friday the group published an open letter to the first minister, saying there had been a ""disproportionately high"" number of officers deployed during the summit, and accused the force of ""intrusive police surveillance"" which it said ""created an atmosphere of fear and intimidation"". However, on the YCL incident, ACC Ritchie said the force had ""clearly set expectations"" for the behaviour of participants and the group were ""intent on not following instructions"". He confirmed the climate march had passed ""largely without incident"". ACC Gary Ritchie said the force expected further protests during the conference ACC Ritchie said: ""Glasgow has hosted a public protest the size and scale of which was beyond anything many of us - both within and outwith policing - can ever remember. ""The procession has been generally good natured, with participants in high spirits, keen to draw attention to their respective causes with Police Scotland officers deployed alongside mutual aid officers from across the UK. ""I want to thank the vast majority of those who attended both the Youth March and the Climate March for their positive attitudes and for following instructions from our officers."" ACC Ritchie later told the BBC that although Friday and Saturday had been ""big ticket"" events, policing would continue throughout the conference. He added: ""We know the protesters are still here, we know there are a lot more decisions to be made at the conference itself and the protesters are going to want their voices heard."" Arouge Salin served cakes and coffee to queues of shivering marchers on Saturday Arouge Salin has worked at the Brave Bakers coffee shop on Saltmarket for around two months. It was one of the few businesses in the area that had opted to stay open on Saturday - a move that paid off as tens of thousands of activists walked by. The 25-year-old was one of three members of staff behind the counter delivering cinnamon twists and hot coffee to shivering customers who had been soaked in the rain. ""It started off quiet, but we had a queue outside the shop until the walk passed - it was non-stop from 15:30 until 18:00, and we normally shut at 17:30. ""We sold out of everything vegan - which never happens. The only thing we had left was our chicken and bacon bake which is usually the first thing to go. ""And we sold so many coffees that our machine jammed. I think people just wanted something warm."" The shop had sold out of most goods on Saturday, but had restocked by Sunday morning Council crews and event organisers took part in the clean up operation on Sunday morning. A yarn installation depicting flowers and bees at the entrance to Glasgow Green was removed by the council due to ""high winds and wet weather"". 'Yarn bombers' had installed their work at the entrance to Glasgow Green There was also a knitted sign which read ""we're watching you"" - a phrase which has appeared on Extinction Rebellion campaign material. A council spokeswoman said: ""It is currently in storage for the owner to collect if they so wish."" They added that overall, no problem areas had been identified and no ""hotspots"" were reported.

"Thousands of people took part in protests around the world on Saturday to demand action on climate change Ministers and negotiators at COP26 should ""pull together and drive for the line"" to secure ambitious action on climate change, Boris Johnson has said. The prime minister said countries must be ready to ""make the bold compromises and ambitious commitments needed"" at the final week of the climate summit. Talks will continue in Glasgow, including on what is needed to limit global temperature rises to 1.5C. Thousands of protesters gathered on Saturday in cities around the world. About 100 climate change demonstrations were held in parts of the UK - including Glasgow, London and Cardiff - while events also took place in Kenya, Turkey, France, Brazil, Australia and Canada. Glasgow's rallywas the largest the city had ever seen, police said, with about 100,000 people taking part. The police arrested 21 scientists at the march. The individuals arrested had chained themselves together and blocked a road bridge to the River Clyde. Meanwhile, in a new development, Environment Secretary George Eustice - who is at the summit - has suggested the government is looking at introducing a carbon border tax. This would be a tax on goods - such as food, mobile phones or cement - coming to the UK from countries that do not meet the UK's obligations on climate action. He told BBC One's Andrew Marr Show it would take time to do and ideally would be done multilaterally. ""We are not going to export pollution,"" he said. ""If you don't want to do that, you do want to consider something like a carbon border tax."" Last week, world leaders attended the first half of COP26 and a series of announcements were made, including: The summit's first major deal, which sawmore than 100 world leaders promise to end and reverse deforestation by 2030 The US and the EU unveiling of global partnership to cut emissions of the greenhouse gas methane by 2030.More than 100 countries have signed up to the initiative More than 40 countriescommitting to shift away from coal Chancellor Rishi Sunak setting out plans to encourage large firmsto work towards the UK's 2050 net-zero target A deal in which South Africa is set to receive $8.5bn (Â£6.2bn)to help end its reliance on coal The parts of the Paris Agreement - the world's first comprehensive deal to tackle climate change - that still need finalising involve markets for trading carbon emissions, transparency over what countries are doing, and common timeframes for action. Discussions will also continue on negotiations on finance for poor countries to adapt to a changing climate as well as on a ""cover decision"" pledge from the summit. This will set out how countries will close the gap between the action to cut emissions they have pledged and what is needed to avoid dangerous temperature rises of more than 1.5C. The world is now about 1.2C warmer than it was in the 19th Century - and extreme weather events like heatwaves, floods and forest fires are already becoming more intense. But unless more is done, the planet is already on course to warm by more than 2C by the end of this century. Several countries, as well as UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres, want accelerated action on emissions cuts this decade to keep the 1.5C goal alive. Experts and climate change campaigners have welcomed the commitments, but argued they need to be delivered on  - warning a previous deal in 2014 had ""failed to slow deforestation at all"". Similarly, activists have argued the deal on coal ""falls well short of the ambition needed"", as the ""small print gives countries enormous leeway"" to choose when to phase out the fossil fuel. How the world is reacting to COP26 Why we're marching in Glasgow Mr Johnson said: ""There is one week left for COP26 to deliver for the world, and we must all pull together and drive for the line."" He said nations had brought ""ambition and action to help limit rising temperatures"", and referred to the pledges that have been made during COP26 - including on deforestation and methane emissions. ""But we cannot underestimate the task at hand to keep 1.5C alive,"" he added. ""Countries must come back to the table this week ready to make the bold compromises and ambitious commitments needed."" Shadow business secretary Ed Miliband has warned the world is a ""long way off"" where it needs to be to take the ""major steps"" to ensure global warming does not exceed 1.5C. The Labour MP urged the prime minister to personally head up the negotiations in the final days of COP26, rather than engaging in ""empty exhortation and commentary"". He said: ""We have a right to expect him to engage directly in these final days, personally driving these negotiations forward, pushing all the major emitters to do more, delivering the finance required for developing and vulnerable countries and ensuring we have a path out of Glasgow to keep 1.5 alive. ""He needs to step up with focus, clarity and urgency in the face of the massive task the world faces in the coming days."" COP26 president Alok Sharma said the billions of dollars to restore the natural world that had been promised during the first week of the summit was humanity's ""first line of defence"" against the crisis. He told a news conference in Glasgow on Saturday that if the world reaches global warming of 1.5C above industrial levels, 70% of coral reefs would be lost.  If it gets to 2C, they would all die, he said. Mr Sharma said the UK will provide Â£500m to protect more than five million hectares of tropical rainforests and create thousands of green jobs across Africa, Asia and Latin America. The UK is also launching a Â£65m Just Rural Transition support programme to help communities move towards more sustainable methods of agriculture and food production, he added.

"Simon Coveney says triggering Article 16 would damage EU-UK relationships The UK's trade deal with the EU could collapse in a row over Northern Ireland, says a senior Irish minister. The UK is thought to be preparing to suspend parts of the Northern Ireland Protocol. Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney hinted the EU could terminate the Trade and Cooperation Agreement in response. He said: ""One is contingent on the other so that if one is being set aside there is a danger that the other will also be set aside by the EU."" Northern Ireland is covered by a special Brexit deal known as the Protocol. It keeps Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods, which prevents a hard border with Ireland and allows free-flowing trade with the EU. But it also creates a trade border between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, which is causing difficulties for some businesses. What is the Northern Ireland Protocol? Article 16 of the Protocol allows parts of the deal to be suspended if it is causing serious problems - the UK says that threshold has been reached. The EUhas proposed operational changesto the Protocol but the UK is demanding more far-reaching changes. Mr Coveney said that if the UK did suspend parts of the Northern Ireland deal it would be ""deliberately forcing a breakdown in relationships and negotiation between the two sides"". He linked that to the wider UK-EU deal, the Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA). Either side can give 12 months notice that they intend to terminate the TCA. Article 16 exists to fix difficulties with the Northern Ireland Protocol that are causing serious problems or causing diversion of trade. The UK government says that threshold was reached long ago and so it can be used legitimately. But the EU fears the UK is planning to use Article 16 in an expansive way - to gut the protocol, sweep away the Irish Sea border and open up a potential back door into the single market. The EU may argue that the broader Brexit trade deal only happened because the issue of the Irish border had been sorted out first. Therefore if the UK collapses that border solution the EU may give notice that it intends to collapse the trade deal. Last week Belgium's Deputy Prime Minister Vincent Van Peteghem suggested that is figuring in the EU's thinking and Simon Coveney alluded to it again on Sunday. Read more:What is Article 16 and why does it matter? On Sunday Mr Coveney said the ""messages"" that he was getting from political parties in Northern Ireland, the European Commission and others was that London was preparing to trigger Article 16 after the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow. He told Irish national broadcaster RTÃ that such a move would be a ""significant act that would damage relationships between Britain and Ireland"". ""I think all the evidence now suggests that the British government are laying the foundations to trigger Article 16,"" Mr Coveney said. ""That is a worry - I think we need not to be naÃ¯ve in terms of what's happening."" The minister said the UK was deliberately asking for ""what they can't get"". Earlier, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said suspending parts of Northern Ireland's Brexit deal would not resolve the dispute between the UK and EU. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer says triggering Article 16 will not resolve row over the Northern Ireland Protocol The Labour leader told BBC One's The Andrew Marr Show he wanted to see ""both sides sitting down and resolving this"". ""There's a little bit of me, I am afraid, that can't help think that the prime minister is constantly trying to pick a fight on things like this so he hopes people don't look elsewhere in the forest, which are things like the Owen Paterson affair,"" Sir Keir said. Asked if he would be prepared to renegotiate the Brexit deal to mitigate any impact on economic growth, Sir Keir said he would not rip up the deal but there were ""sensible adjustments"" that could be made to improve the arrangement. Triggering Article 16 'would be colossally stupid' Why Brexit still has a Northern Ireland problem ""I think we need to make Brexit work... in order to do that, we have got to deal with some of the gaps and weaknesses in the current arrangements."" The Labour leader said he would do ""whatever I could to make it easier for British firms to trade across the world, but particularly with the EU"". ""What I'm not talking about is re-joining the EU, what I'm not talking about is ripping up the current agreement and starting again - nobody wants to be in that place."" Former Conservative Prime Minister Sir John Major said on Saturday that triggering Article 16 and suspending parts of the Northern Ireland Protocolwould be ""colossally stupid"". Meanwhile, Sinn FÃ©in leader Mary Lou McDonald has warned the UK government that suspending parts of the protocol could endanger the wider Brexit withdrawal agreement with the EU. On the prospect of the UK triggering Article 16, Ms McDonald said: ""It would demonstrate just again colossal bad faith and demonstrate again that Ireland, the north of Ireland in particular, is collateral damage in the Tory Brexit as they play games and play a game of chicken with the European institutions.""

"Elon Musk is critical of a ""billionaires tax"" being proposed by some Democrats Voters in a Twitter poll have urged Elon Musk to sell 10% of his stake in Tesla in order to pay tax. More than 3.5 million Twitter users voted in the poll, launched by Mr Musk on Saturday, with nearly 58% voting in favour of the share sale. The vote could see him dispose of nearly $21bn (Â£16bn) of stock in the electric carmaker. He has promised to abide by the result, in response to a ""billionaires tax"" proposed by US Democrats. But Mr Musk, one of the world's richest men, has yet to comment publicly on the verdict, or how and when he would sell his stake. Should he go ahead with the sale, it could leave him with a huge tax bill. When disposing of large share holdings, some chief executives use so-called ""blind"" sales programmes, spreading the sale over a long time period to avoid accusations of insider trading. In an earlier tweet on Saturday, Mr Musk said he took no salary or bonuses from any of his companies - meaning he has no earnings on which to pay income tax. But he has made billions of dollars through a compensation package, which gives him power to exercise large amounts of stock options when the company meets performance targets and its shares hit certain prices.

Mr Musk has an option, which expires in August next year, to buy 22.86 million Tesla shares at $6.24 each - a fraction of Tesla's closing share price on Friday of $1,222. Under plans proposed by the Democratic Party in the Senate, billionaires could be taxed on ""unrealised gains"" when the price of their shares goes up - even if they do not sell any of their stock. It is thought the proposed tax on capital gains, whether or not assets have been sold, could hit about 700 billionaires in the US. Critics have pointed out that the value of assets do not always go up. Elon Musk says Tesla has not signed Hertz deal US super-rich 'pay almost no income tax' Tesla surpasses a $1 trillion valuation Mr Musk's recent Twitter poll has raised some eyebrows in the world of finance. ""We are witnessing the Twitter masses deciding the outcome of a $25B coin flip,"" Venture investor Chamath Palihapitiya wrote on Twitter. ""Looking forward to the day when the richest person in the world paying some tax does not depend on a Twitter poll,"" Berkeley economist Gabriel Zucman tweeted. This video can not be played Who is Elon Musk? Meet the meme-loving magnate behind SpaceX and Tesla...published in 2021 Mr Musk is one of the most popular business leaders on Twitter, with nearly 63 million followers. He regularly uses the platform to share updates from the companies he owns - including SpaceX and Neuralink. He is also known for sharing memes, adding to his popularity among fans. But some posts have drawn controversy.

"Simon Coveney says triggering Article 16 would damage EU-UK relationships The UK's trade deal with the EU could collapse in a row over Northern Ireland, says a senior Irish minister. The UK is thought to be preparing to suspend parts of the Northern Ireland Protocol. Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney hinted the EU could terminate the Trade and Cooperation Agreement in response. He said: ""One is contingent on the other so that if one is being set aside there is a danger that the other will also be set aside by the EU."" Northern Ireland is covered by a special Brexit deal known as the Protocol. It keeps Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods, which prevents a hard border with Ireland and allows free-flowing trade with the EU. But it also creates a trade border between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, which is causing difficulties for some businesses. What is the Northern Ireland Protocol? Article 16 of the Protocol allows parts of the deal to be suspended if it is causing serious problems - the UK says that threshold has been reached. The EUhas proposed operational changesto the Protocol but the UK is demanding more far-reaching changes. Mr Coveney said that if the UK did suspend parts of the Northern Ireland deal it would be ""deliberately forcing a breakdown in relationships and negotiation between the two sides"". He linked that to the wider UK-EU deal, the Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA). Either side can give 12 months notice that they intend to terminate the TCA. Article 16 exists to fix difficulties with the Northern Ireland Protocol that are causing serious problems or causing diversion of trade. The UK government says that threshold was reached long ago and so it can be used legitimately. But the EU fears the UK is planning to use Article 16 in an expansive way - to gut the protocol, sweep away the Irish Sea border and open up a potential back door into the single market. The EU may argue that the broader Brexit trade deal only happened because the issue of the Irish border had been sorted out first. Therefore if the UK collapses that border solution the EU may give notice that it intends to collapse the trade deal. Last week Belgium's Deputy Prime Minister Vincent Van Peteghem suggested that is figuring in the EU's thinking and Simon Coveney alluded to it again on Sunday. Read more:What is Article 16 and why does it matter? On Sunday Mr Coveney said the ""messages"" that he was getting from political parties in Northern Ireland, the European Commission and others was that London was preparing to trigger Article 16 after the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow. He told Irish national broadcaster RTÃ that such a move would be a ""significant act that would damage relationships between Britain and Ireland"". ""I think all the evidence now suggests that the British government are laying the foundations to trigger Article 16,"" Mr Coveney said. ""That is a worry - I think we need not to be naÃ¯ve in terms of what's happening."" The minister said the UK was deliberately asking for ""what they can't get"". Earlier, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said suspending parts of Northern Ireland's Brexit deal would not resolve the dispute between the UK and EU. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer says triggering Article 16 will not resolve row over the Northern Ireland Protocol The Labour leader told BBC One's The Andrew Marr Show he wanted to see ""both sides sitting down and resolving this"". ""There's a little bit of me, I am afraid, that can't help think that the prime minister is constantly trying to pick a fight on things like this so he hopes people don't look elsewhere in the forest, which are things like the Owen Paterson affair,"" Sir Keir said. Asked if he would be prepared to renegotiate the Brexit deal to mitigate any impact on economic growth, Sir Keir said he would not rip up the deal but there were ""sensible adjustments"" that could be made to improve the arrangement. Triggering Article 16 'would be colossally stupid' Why Brexit still has a Northern Ireland problem ""I think we need to make Brexit work... in order to do that, we have got to deal with some of the gaps and weaknesses in the current arrangements."" The Labour leader said he would do ""whatever I could to make it easier for British firms to trade across the world, but particularly with the EU"". ""What I'm not talking about is re-joining the EU, what I'm not talking about is ripping up the current agreement and starting again - nobody wants to be in that place."" Former Conservative Prime Minister Sir John Major said on Saturday that triggering Article 16 and suspending parts of the Northern Ireland Protocolwould be ""colossally stupid"". Meanwhile, Sinn FÃ©in leader Mary Lou McDonald has warned the UK government that suspending parts of the protocol could endanger the wider Brexit withdrawal agreement with the EU. On the prospect of the UK triggering Article 16, Ms McDonald said: ""It would demonstrate just again colossal bad faith and demonstrate again that Ireland, the north of Ireland in particular, is collateral damage in the Tory Brexit as they play games and play a game of chicken with the European institutions.""

"Brianna Rodriguez's family said she was ""beautiful and vibrant"" Family and friends have been paying tribute to those who died following a crowd surge at rapper Travis Scott's Astroworld festival in Houston, Texas. At least eight people were killed and hundreds hurt at the music event, which is now under investigation by police. Scott has said he is working to help victims' families, but several concert-goers are suing him and the promoters for damages. Most of the victims were young people, with the youngest said to be just 14. The family of one victim, 16-year-old Brianna Rodriguez, spoke of their ""profound sadness"" and said the passionate dancer was ""dancing her way to heaven's pearly gates"". This video can not be played Astroworld security officer ""felt a prick in his neck"" â Houston Police Chief Troy Finner Earlier, Houston police said their investigation into the crush would include looking into reports that somebody in the audience had been injecting people with drugs. The surge began around 21:15 on Friday (02:15 GMT Saturday) when panic broke out as the crowd pressed towards the front of the stage during the rapper's headline set. As the crush began causing injuries to people, panic grew and the casualties quickly overwhelmed the on-site first aiders, officials said. Some 300 people were treated for injuries such as cuts and bruises. Several people allegedly injured during the crowd surge have filed lawsuits against Travis Scott and festival promoter Live Nation. One lawsuit also accuses rap artist Drake, who appeared as a surprise performer, of inciting crowds ""even though he knew of ""[Travis Scott's] prior conduct"". In 2018, Travis Scott pleaded guilty to a public disorder charge after he was accused of encouraging people to rush the stage at a concert in the US state of Arkansas. According to a local newspaper, he also paid nearly $7,000 (Â£5,186) to two people who said they were injured at the event. Neither he nor Drake have commented on the new lawsuits against them. On Sunday, GoFund Me pages and emotional social media tributes to those who died were widely shared online. Danish Baigwas 27. His brother Basil Mirza Baig posted on Facebook that he had been killed while trying to save another relative in the crush. ""His smile would light up a room"", he wrote. Rudy PeÃ±a, from Laredo, Texas. His age has not yet been confirmed.His sister told the Laredo Morning Times,externalthat he was ""the sweetest person, friendly, outgoing, he had many friends because he was always there for everyone... he was a big fan of Travis, he loved his music.""

His university confirmed his deathto local TV station WHIO.,externalHe was a member of the Alpha Psi Lambda fraternity and completing a work placement in Mason, Ohio.

John Hilgert, 14, the youngest to die at Astroworld. ""He was one of the nicest kids I knew and always made people laugh,""a friend said on Twitter.,external Jacob Jurinek, 20, an art and media student at Southern Illinois University. In a statement, his family said he was known for his ""contagious enthusiasm, boundless energy and his unwavering positive attitude"". Axel Acosta, 21, studying computer science at Western Washington University. His family told local media that he'd travelled alone to the show - the first music festival he'd ever attended. On Saturday, Houston police Chief Troy Finner said the investigation into the tragedy would include the homicide and narcotics divisions. Teams will review video from the scene to explore the causes of the surge and what had prevented people from being able to escape. Several concert goers had to be revived with anti-drug overdose medicine, including a security officer who police said appeared to have an injection mark. ""We do have a report of a security officer... that he was reaching over to restrain or grab a citizen and he felt a prick in his neck,"" Chief Finner said. ""When he was examined he went unconscious,"" he added. ""He was revived and the medical staff did notice a prick that was similar to a prick that you would get if somebody is trying to inject."" In his first statement since the event on Twitter, Travis Scott thanked the police and emergency services andsaid he was ""committed to working together with the Houston community to heal and support the families in need"". Later he posted a video message on Instagram, in whichhe encouraged anyone with information about the incident to contact the authorities,external. This video can not be played ""I'm honestly just devastated"" â Travis Scott posted this video on Instagram Scott, whose real name is Jacques Webster, made his big breakthrough in 2013 and has since hadeight nominations for Grammy Awards,external. He has a child - and another one on the way - with businesswoman and reality TV star Kylie Jenner, who was among the 50,000 people at the festival. She posted on Instagram that they were ""broken and devastated"". ""I want to make it clear we weren't aware of any fatalities until the news came out after the show and in no world would have continued filming or performing"", she wrote. AngÃ©lica Casas, BBC News, Houston A makeshift memorial has been set up along some fencing near the entrance to the festival grounds. Ruby Ayala, 19, came to pay tribute with her family. This was Ayala's first music festival. She went with her sister and some friends - and they made new friends among the crowd. One of them was Franco Patino, who had travelled to Texas from out of state. He has now been confirmed as one of the eight victims. ""He had told us he would protect us because he had been to concerts like these before,"" Ayala said in tears. ""I thought to myself, 'I'll just stick with him'."" When the commotion began, they thought it was a mosh pit, a popular dance at music events that involves people pushing against others. But then everyone around them started having trouble breathing and it was hard to get out. They soon lost Patino in the crowd. ""If I would have moved over just a little bit, that could have been me."" Standing in front of the memorial, Ayala's younger sister leans in to hug her. ""It's hard to believe the candles here are also for him."" Ayala's mother, Graciela Martinez, still can't believe her daughters were among the attendees that day. They had called her Friday night right after the festival. ""I didn't understand why she was so upset,"" Martinez said, of her daughter's call. ""She forgot to tell me there were people stepping on dead people. It's painful to see that they went through that and there was nothing we (as parents) could do to help them."" Marc Medina, 18, is also back here with his family today. He starts remembering how at the concert he passed by a woman needing help. ""There was this girl and she fellâ¦"" He can't bring himself to continue. ""It's not easy to come back here,"" he said. ""But you want people to feel remembered and not forgotten.""

"Dean Smith is the fifth manager to either be sacked or leave his job in the Premier League this season Aston Villa have sacked manager Dean Smith after three years in charge. Smith, 50, leaves following Villa's1-0 defeat by Southamptonon Friday, the club's fifth successive defeat in the Premier League. Villa are 17th in the league, two points above the relegation zone. ""This year we have not seen the continuous improvement in results, performances and league position which we have all been looking for,"" Villa chief executive Christian Purslow said. ""For this reason we have decided to make a change now to allow time for a new head coach to make an impact."" Villa say the process to replace Smith has started but they will not rush into an immediate appointment - however, it is understood that Denmark coach Kasper Hjulmand is a name of interest to the club and is admired by fellow countryman, Villa's sporting director Johan Lange. Hjulmand guided Denmark to the Euro 2020 semi-final, when they lost to England at Wembley, and the 49-year-old has a growing reputation. Rangers manager Steven Gerrard and Belgium boss Roberto Martinez are also believed to be in contention, with Villa using the time afforded to them by the international break to home in on Smith's successor. The impossible job - is the abuse of managers out of control? Smith was appointed Villa manager in October 2018, guiding them to promotion from the Championship in his first season in charge. Though they struggled in their first season in the top flight, narrowly avoiding relegation, Smith led the club to the 2019-20 Carabao Cup final. The 2020-21 season saw Villa achieve an 11th-place finish in the Premier League, but after the departure of star player Jack Grealish to Manchester City in the summer, results started to slip. The club have not won since they defeated Manchester United on 25 September, picking up just 10 points from the first 11 games of the season. It is their worst losing run since January to February 2017 in the Championship. Smith leaves the club having won 28 of his 87 Premier League games in charge (32.2%) and with an overall win rate of 39.6% from his 139 games. Smith is the fifth managerial change in the top flight this season with Tottenham sacking Nuno Espirito Santo on Monday and Norwich dismissing Daniel Farke late on Saturday. Watford sacked Xisco Munoz in October, while Steve Bruce left his role as Newcastle manager by mutual consent on 20 October. There were just four managerial changes in the whole of last season. ""The board would like to sincerely thank Dean for his many excellent achievements, on and off the pitch, during this time,"" added Purslow. ""Everyone knows how much Aston Villa means to Dean and his family. He has represented the club with distinction and dignity - universally liked and respected by everybody associated with Aston Villa."" Grealishtweeted:,external""No-one will ever compare, the real goat (greatest of all time)."" BBC Sport's chief football writer Phil McNulty Dean Smith can leave Aston Villa with his head held high after taking his boyhood club back into the Premier League and establishing them there but growing expectations, big ambitions and five straight defeats brought his reign to an end. Villa sold talisman Jack Grealish to Manchester City for Â£100m but the money was reinvested in club record signing Emiliano Buendia from Norwich City, as well as Danny Ings and Leon Bailey from Southampton and Bayer Leverkusen respectively. Grealish was always going to be missed but Villa's hierarchy were hoping the new faces would allow them to build on last season's 11th place. He has had bad luck with injuries to players like Ings and Bailey but the 1-0 win at Manchester United proved to be a false dawn and Villa decided it was time for action after the defeat at Southampton. It will be a desperate personal blow to Smith, with the 50-year-old fulfilling a dream when he left Brentford for Villa Park in 2018. Smith is a popular figure, regarded as one of their own by Villa fans, and there will be real disappointment that this decision has been taken but club owners Nassef Sawiris and Wes Edens are fiercely ambitious and believe they should be at least challenging for European places. And there is unlikely to be a shortage of interest in Smith's services once he has taken stock and recovered from this sacking as so much of his work at Villa Park has been admirable. Ex-Manchester City defender Micah Richards on Match of the Day:""I just thought for someone who gave so much to the club, he would have been given a little bit more time."" Former Everton and Wales defender Ashley Williams on Match of the Day:""It is surprising to me, because of what he has done at Villa for so long. Yes, they are not on a good run of form but I would have thought he would have been backed to turn things around. They have got a good squad there, and all teams go through a bit of a bad spell, I didn't think it was time for him to go."" Former Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher on Sky Sports:""Villa must have looked at someone and thought they can do better. Smith hasn't done a bad job. In the past, if you go on long runs without a win it is usually double what Villa are on now. The international break is a killer for managers."" Former Manchester City defender Nedum Onuoha on BBC Radio 5 Live:""Villa's standards have gotten higher. Losing five games in a row, they're sinking like a stone and that shouldn't be happening for a team that was aiming as high as they were, so I get it. ""This is the last chance before the international break and that gives them two weeks to appoint someone new; the time wouldn't be right later in the season. ""Smith has taken them so far, so it's a shame, but as far as results go they haven't been good enough."" Ex-Manchester City midfielder Michael Brown on BBC Radio 5 Live:""When Dean Smith said at the start of the season that he expected a top-10 finish, that put the pressure on him.

"Anti-mafia prosecutor Nicola Gratteri has spent 30 years tackling organised crime groups An Italian court has sentenced 70 members of the powerful mafia group, the 'Ndrangheta, in the first stage of the biggest mafia trial in decades. Defendants faced charges including attempted murder and extortion. Over the next two years, 355 alleged mobsters and corrupt officials will face court for their involvement with Italy's richest and most powerful organised crime group. Hundreds of lawyers and nearly a thousand witnesses are involved. Saturday's ""maxi trials"" took place behind closed doors in a specially converted courtroom in the Calabrian city of Lamezia Terme. Those accused had opted for a speedy trial which allowed them to have their sentences reduced by a third if found guilty. Judges handed six of those convicted the maximum 20-year sentence that prosecutors had asked for. Another 21 defendants were acquitted. The 'Ndrangheta is a sprawling criminal network consisting of some 150 families. This trial is targeting just one of those: The Mancuso family. The lengthy charge sheet includes an array of drugs charges, murder, attempted murder, extortion, loan sharking, disclosure of official secrets and abuse of office. Alleged boss Luigi Mancuso, 67, who goes by the nickname ""the Uncle"", and ex-senator Giancarlo Pittelli, 68, who prosecutors have alleged was his white-collar fixer, will face longer court trials at a later date. BACKGROUND:Biggest mafia trial in decades opens in Italy EXPLAINER:How Italy's crime families went global PROFILE:Nicola Gratteri: Life as the Enemy of the Mafia Leading the case is Nicola Gratteri, one of Italy's most respected anti-mafia chief prosecutors. He has spent decades tackling the Italian crime gangs and as a consequence has lived under police protection for more than 30 years. Mr Gratteri vowed earlier this year to take down ""this asphyxiating 'Ndrangheta, which truly takes the breath and the heartbeat from the people"" and told reporters that Saturday's sentencing had ""gone very well"". The 'Ndrangheta rose to prominence after the maxi trials of the late 1980s, which significantly weakened Sicily's Cosa Nostra mafia families. The 'Ndrangheta is involved in a wide range of illegal activities, but it specialises in cocaine trafficking and is believed to control about 80% of Europe's trade.

"Simon Coveney says triggering Article 16 would damage EU-UK relationships The UK's trade deal with the EU could collapse in a row over Northern Ireland, says a senior Irish minister. The UK is thought to be preparing to suspend parts of the Northern Ireland Protocol. Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney hinted the EU could terminate the Trade and Cooperation Agreement in response. He said: ""One is contingent on the other so that if one is being set aside there is a danger that the other will also be set aside by the EU."" Northern Ireland is covered by a special Brexit deal known as the Protocol. It keeps Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods, which prevents a hard border with Ireland and allows free-flowing trade with the EU. But it also creates a trade border between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, which is causing difficulties for some businesses. What is the Northern Ireland Protocol? Article 16 of the Protocol allows parts of the deal to be suspended if it is causing serious problems - the UK says that threshold has been reached. The EUhas proposed operational changesto the Protocol but the UK is demanding more far-reaching changes. Mr Coveney said that if the UK did suspend parts of the Northern Ireland deal it would be ""deliberately forcing a breakdown in relationships and negotiation between the two sides"". He linked that to the wider UK-EU deal, the Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA). Either side can give 12 months notice that they intend to terminate the TCA. Article 16 exists to fix difficulties with the Northern Ireland Protocol that are causing serious problems or causing diversion of trade. The UK government says that threshold was reached long ago and so it can be used legitimately. But the EU fears the UK is planning to use Article 16 in an expansive way - to gut the protocol, sweep away the Irish Sea border and open up a potential back door into the single market. The EU may argue that the broader Brexit trade deal only happened because the issue of the Irish border had been sorted out first. Therefore if the UK collapses that border solution the EU may give notice that it intends to collapse the trade deal. Last week Belgium's Deputy Prime Minister Vincent Van Peteghem suggested that is figuring in the EU's thinking and Simon Coveney alluded to it again on Sunday. Read more:What is Article 16 and why does it matter? On Sunday Mr Coveney said the ""messages"" that he was getting from political parties in Northern Ireland, the European Commission and others was that London was preparing to trigger Article 16 after the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow. He told Irish national broadcaster RTÃ that such a move would be a ""significant act that would damage relationships between Britain and Ireland"". ""I think all the evidence now suggests that the British government are laying the foundations to trigger Article 16,"" Mr Coveney said. ""That is a worry - I think we need not to be naÃ¯ve in terms of what's happening."" The minister said the UK was deliberately asking for ""what they can't get"". Earlier, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said suspending parts of Northern Ireland's Brexit deal would not resolve the dispute between the UK and EU. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer says triggering Article 16 will not resolve row over the Northern Ireland Protocol The Labour leader told BBC One's The Andrew Marr Show he wanted to see ""both sides sitting down and resolving this"". ""There's a little bit of me, I am afraid, that can't help think that the prime minister is constantly trying to pick a fight on things like this so he hopes people don't look elsewhere in the forest, which are things like the Owen Paterson affair,"" Sir Keir said. Asked if he would be prepared to renegotiate the Brexit deal to mitigate any impact on economic growth, Sir Keir said he would not rip up the deal but there were ""sensible adjustments"" that could be made to improve the arrangement. Triggering Article 16 'would be colossally stupid' Why Brexit still has a Northern Ireland problem ""I think we need to make Brexit work... in order to do that, we have got to deal with some of the gaps and weaknesses in the current arrangements."" The Labour leader said he would do ""whatever I could to make it easier for British firms to trade across the world, but particularly with the EU"". ""What I'm not talking about is re-joining the EU, what I'm not talking about is ripping up the current agreement and starting again - nobody wants to be in that place."" Former Conservative Prime Minister Sir John Major said on Saturday that triggering Article 16 and suspending parts of the Northern Ireland Protocolwould be ""colossally stupid"". Meanwhile, Sinn FÃ©in leader Mary Lou McDonald has warned the UK government that suspending parts of the protocol could endanger the wider Brexit withdrawal agreement with the EU. On the prospect of the UK triggering Article 16, Ms McDonald said: ""It would demonstrate just again colossal bad faith and demonstrate again that Ireland, the north of Ireland in particular, is collateral damage in the Tory Brexit as they play games and play a game of chicken with the European institutions.""

"The house retains some original features, including the bath, sink and doors The childhood home of George Harrison is up for auction. The Beatles guitarist moved to 25 Upton Green in Speke, Liverpool, in 1949 when he was six years old. He rehearsed with John Lennon and Paul McCartney at the house, which the Harrisons left in 1962 just as the Fab Four were about to hit the big time. Auctioneer Paul Fairweather said the three-bedroom property was ""a steal"" at an estimated price of between Â£160,000 and Â£200,000. Harrison, pictured outside the family home in Speke, learned to play the guitar at 25 Upton Green Harrison, the youngest of four children, previously lived with his parents Harold and Louise - and the family's pet cockerels -in a small house in Arnold Grove, Wavertree. The Harrisons had been on a rehousing list for about 18 years when the opportunity arose to move to the new Speke housing estate. Harrison continued to go to Dovedale Primary School, which was also attended by Lennon - although they were unaware of each other due to the two-and-a-half year age gap. Lennon's skiffle group The Quarrymen rehearsed at 25 Upton Green when he, Harrison and fellow member Paul McCartney were teenagers. The band eventually evolved into The Beatles, the name the members adopted in 1960. George Harrison rehearsed with John Lennon and Paul McCartney at his family home, before Ringo Starr joined the band The mid-terrace house was last on the market seven years ago, when it was bought by a Beatles fan for Â£156,000. Although there have been renovations, the house retains some original features, including the bath, sink, doors and outbuildings, Mr Fairweather said. ""George will have learned to play the guitar in this house and the photos of the group gathering there in the early 1960s are amazing to see."" He said he was expecting the imminent release of The Beatles: Get Back documentary by Lord of the Rings director Peter Jackson to generate more interest in the sale, adding there was an option to apply for a blue heritage plaque for the property. In 1965, Harrison bought his parents a bungalow in Appleton, near Warrington, with some of the profits of his international success as a Beatle. After the band's break-up in 1970, he continued to compose and perform and produced films with the Monty Python comedians. Harrison died of cancer at the age of 58 in 2001.

"Thousands of people took part in protests around the world on Saturday to demand action on climate change Ministers and negotiators at COP26 should ""pull together and drive for the line"" to secure ambitious action on climate change, Boris Johnson has said. The prime minister said countries must be ready to ""make the bold compromises and ambitious commitments needed"" at the final week of the climate summit. Talks will continue in Glasgow, including on what is needed to limit global temperature rises to 1.5C. Thousands of protesters gathered on Saturday in cities around the world. About 100 climate change demonstrations were held in parts of the UK - including Glasgow, London and Cardiff - while events also took place in Kenya, Turkey, France, Brazil, Australia and Canada. Glasgow's rallywas the largest the city had ever seen, police said, with about 100,000 people taking part. The police arrested 21 scientists at the march. The individuals arrested had chained themselves together and blocked a road bridge to the River Clyde. Meanwhile, in a new development, Environment Secretary George Eustice - who is at the summit - has suggested the government is looking at introducing a carbon border tax. This would be a tax on goods - such as food, mobile phones or cement - coming to the UK from countries that do not meet the UK's obligations on climate action. He told BBC One's Andrew Marr Show it would take time to do and ideally would be done multilaterally. ""We are not going to export pollution,"" he said. ""If you don't want to do that, you do want to consider something like a carbon border tax."" Last week, world leaders attended the first half of COP26 and a series of announcements were made, including: The summit's first major deal, which sawmore than 100 world leaders promise to end and reverse deforestation by 2030 The US and the EU unveiling of global partnership to cut emissions of the greenhouse gas methane by 2030.More than 100 countries have signed up to the initiative More than 40 countriescommitting to shift away from coal Chancellor Rishi Sunak setting out plans to encourage large firmsto work towards the UK's 2050 net-zero target A deal in which South Africa is set to receive $8.5bn (Â£6.2bn)to help end its reliance on coal The parts of the Paris Agreement - the world's first comprehensive deal to tackle climate change - that still need finalising involve markets for trading carbon emissions, transparency over what countries are doing, and common timeframes for action. Discussions will also continue on negotiations on finance for poor countries to adapt to a changing climate as well as on a ""cover decision"" pledge from the summit. This will set out how countries will close the gap between the action to cut emissions they have pledged and what is needed to avoid dangerous temperature rises of more than 1.5C. The world is now about 1.2C warmer than it was in the 19th Century - and extreme weather events like heatwaves, floods and forest fires are already becoming more intense. But unless more is done, the planet is already on course to warm by more than 2C by the end of this century. Several countries, as well as UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres, want accelerated action on emissions cuts this decade to keep the 1.5C goal alive. Experts and climate change campaigners have welcomed the commitments, but argued they need to be delivered on  - warning a previous deal in 2014 had ""failed to slow deforestation at all"". Similarly, activists have argued the deal on coal ""falls well short of the ambition needed"", as the ""small print gives countries enormous leeway"" to choose when to phase out the fossil fuel. How the world is reacting to COP26 Why we're marching in Glasgow Mr Johnson said: ""There is one week left for COP26 to deliver for the world, and we must all pull together and drive for the line."" He said nations had brought ""ambition and action to help limit rising temperatures"", and referred to the pledges that have been made during COP26 - including on deforestation and methane emissions. ""But we cannot underestimate the task at hand to keep 1.5C alive,"" he added. ""Countries must come back to the table this week ready to make the bold compromises and ambitious commitments needed."" Shadow business secretary Ed Miliband has warned the world is a ""long way off"" where it needs to be to take the ""major steps"" to ensure global warming does not exceed 1.5C. The Labour MP urged the prime minister to personally head up the negotiations in the final days of COP26, rather than engaging in ""empty exhortation and commentary"". He said: ""We have a right to expect him to engage directly in these final days, personally driving these negotiations forward, pushing all the major emitters to do more, delivering the finance required for developing and vulnerable countries and ensuring we have a path out of Glasgow to keep 1.5 alive. ""He needs to step up with focus, clarity and urgency in the face of the massive task the world faces in the coming days."" COP26 president Alok Sharma said the billions of dollars to restore the natural world that had been promised during the first week of the summit was humanity's ""first line of defence"" against the crisis. He told a news conference in Glasgow on Saturday that if the world reaches global warming of 1.5C above industrial levels, 70% of coral reefs would be lost.  If it gets to 2C, they would all die, he said. Mr Sharma said the UK will provide Â£500m to protect more than five million hectares of tropical rainforests and create thousands of green jobs across Africa, Asia and Latin America. The UK is also launching a Â£65m Just Rural Transition support programme to help communities move towards more sustainable methods of agriculture and food production, he added.

George Harrison rehearsed with John Lennon and Paul McCartney at his family home, before Ringo Starr joined the band The mid-terrace house was last on the market seven years ago, when it was bought by a Beatles fan for Â£156,000. Although there have been renovations, the house retains some original features, including the bath, sink, doors and outbuildings, Mr Fairweather said. ""George will have learned to play the guitar in this house and the photos of the group gathering there in the early 1960s are amazing to see."" He said he was expecting the imminent release of The Beatles: Get Back documentary by Lord of the Rings director Peter Jackson to generate more interest in the sale, adding there was an option to apply for a blue heritage plaque for the property. In 1965, Harrison bought his parents a bungalow in Appleton, near Warrington, with some of the profits of his international success as a Beatle. After the band's break-up in 1970, he continued to compose and perform and produced films with the Monty Python comedians. Harrison died of cancer at the age of 58 in 2001.

"About 100,000 people marched through the streets of Glasgow on Saturday Police have praised the majority of ""good natured"" marchers who took part in one of Glasgow's largest protests in memory. About 100,000 took part in the procession from Kelvingrove Park to Glasgow Green on Saturday. Officers made 22 arrests - one after a socialist group were contained and the rest after protesters chained themselves on a bridge. Crowds swiftly dispersed after speeches concluded leaving little litter behind. Police later told the BBC there were no major incidents following the event. Officers said people taking part were mostly ""good natured"" and in ""high spirits"" The march was organised by the COP26 Coalition - a network of social and environmental groups in the UK - as part of a Global Day of Action for Climate Justice. It started at Kelvingrove Park in the west of the city and Queen's Park in the south at about midday and made its way along a pre-agreed three-mile route to Glasgow Green. About 100 climate change demonstrations were held in other parts of the UK while events were also taking place in a further 100 countries including Kenya, Turkey, France, Brazil, Australia and Canada. The COP26 Coalition are also running a ""People's Summit"" programme of events from 7-10 November where members of the climate justice movement will meet to ""strategise for system change"". Away from the march at about 11:00, 21 protesters fromScientist Rebellion,externalchained themselves together on the King George V Bridge in Glasgow city centre, resulting in a road closure. Charlie Gardner, an associate senior lecturer at Durell Institute of Conservation and Ecology, said scientists could not ""rely on our leaders to save us anymore"" and had a ""moral duty to act"". Police said 21 people were arrested following the incident and were released on an undertaking. Meanwhile, officers surrounded a group of activists from the Young Communist League (YCL) during the march on St Vincent Street - police said this was because pyrotechnics had been set off and the group's behaviour had ""deteriorated"". Assistant Chief Constable Gary Ritchie told the BBC they group were ""trying to create confrontation"" with officers, were acting ""violently"" and were stopping which ""created a public safety issue"". The group were removed from the procession and one person was then arrested. This video can not be played Officers surrounded a group of activists at one point during the march Some have criticised the policing of the march, with the COP26 Coalition describing the ""kettling"" as  ""heavy-handed and disproportionate"". On Friday the group published an open letter to the first minister, saying there had been a ""disproportionately high"" number of officers deployed during the summit, and accused the force of ""intrusive police surveillance"" which it said ""created an atmosphere of fear and intimidation"". However, on the YCL incident, ACC Ritchie said the force had ""clearly set expectations"" for the behaviour of participants and the group were ""intent on not following instructions"". He confirmed the climate march had passed ""largely without incident"". ACC Gary Ritchie said the force expected further protests during the conference ACC Ritchie said: ""Glasgow has hosted a public protest the size and scale of which was beyond anything many of us - both within and outwith policing - can ever remember. ""The procession has been generally good natured, with participants in high spirits, keen to draw attention to their respective causes with Police Scotland officers deployed alongside mutual aid officers from across the UK. ""I want to thank the vast majority of those who attended both the Youth March and the Climate March for their positive attitudes and for following instructions from our officers."" ACC Ritchie later told the BBC that although Friday and Saturday had been ""big ticket"" events, policing would continue throughout the conference. He added: ""We know the protesters are still here, we know there are a lot more decisions to be made at the conference itself and the protesters are going to want their voices heard."" Arouge Salin served cakes and coffee to queues of shivering marchers on Saturday Arouge Salin has worked at the Brave Bakers coffee shop on Saltmarket for around two months. It was one of the few businesses in the area that had opted to stay open on Saturday - a move that paid off as tens of thousands of activists walked by. The 25-year-old was one of three members of staff behind the counter delivering cinnamon twists and hot coffee to shivering customers who had been soaked in the rain. ""It started off quiet, but we had a queue outside the shop until the walk passed - it was non-stop from 15:30 until 18:00, and we normally shut at 17:30. ""We sold out of everything vegan - which never happens. The only thing we had left was our chicken and bacon bake which is usually the first thing to go. ""And we sold so many coffees that our machine jammed. I think people just wanted something warm."" The shop had sold out of most goods on Saturday, but had restocked by Sunday morning Council crews and event organisers took part in the clean up operation on Sunday morning. A yarn installation depicting flowers and bees at the entrance to Glasgow Green was removed by the council due to ""high winds and wet weather"". 'Yarn bombers' had installed their work at the entrance to Glasgow Green There was also a knitted sign which read ""we're watching you"" - a phrase which has appeared on Extinction Rebellion campaign material. A council spokeswoman said: ""It is currently in storage for the owner to collect if they so wish."" They added that overall, no problem areas had been identified and no ""hotspots"" were reported.

"Thousands of people took part in protests around the world on Saturday to demand action on climate change Ministers and negotiators at COP26 should ""pull together and drive for the line"" to secure ambitious action on climate change, Boris Johnson has said. The prime minister said countries must be ready to ""make the bold compromises and ambitious commitments needed"" at the final week of the climate summit. Talks will continue in Glasgow, including on what is needed to limit global temperature rises to 1.5C. Thousands of protesters gathered on Saturday in cities around the world. About 100 climate change demonstrations were held in parts of the UK - including Glasgow, London and Cardiff - while events also took place in Kenya, Turkey, France, Brazil, Australia and Canada. Glasgow's rallywas the largest the city had ever seen, police said, with about 100,000 people taking part. The police arrested 21 scientists at the march. The individuals arrested had chained themselves together and blocked a road bridge to the River Clyde. Meanwhile, in a new development, Environment Secretary George Eustice - who is at the summit - has suggested the government is looking at introducing a carbon border tax. This would be a tax on goods - such as food, mobile phones or cement - coming to the UK from countries that do not meet the UK's obligations on climate action. He told BBC One's Andrew Marr Show it would take time to do and ideally would be done multilaterally. ""We are not going to export pollution,"" he said. ""If you don't want to do that, you do want to consider something like a carbon border tax."" Last week, world leaders attended the first half of COP26 and a series of announcements were made, including: The summit's first major deal, which sawmore than 100 world leaders promise to end and reverse deforestation by 2030 The US and the EU unveiling of global partnership to cut emissions of the greenhouse gas methane by 2030.More than 100 countries have signed up to the initiative More than 40 countriescommitting to shift away from coal Chancellor Rishi Sunak setting out plans to encourage large firmsto work towards the UK's 2050 net-zero target A deal in which South Africa is set to receive $8.5bn (Â£6.2bn)to help end its reliance on coal The parts of the Paris Agreement - the world's first comprehensive deal to tackle climate change - that still need finalising involve markets for trading carbon emissions, transparency over what countries are doing, and common timeframes for action. Discussions will also continue on negotiations on finance for poor countries to adapt to a changing climate as well as on a ""cover decision"" pledge from the summit. This will set out how countries will close the gap between the action to cut emissions they have pledged and what is needed to avoid dangerous temperature rises of more than 1.5C. The world is now about 1.2C warmer than it was in the 19th Century - and extreme weather events like heatwaves, floods and forest fires are already becoming more intense. But unless more is done, the planet is already on course to warm by more than 2C by the end of this century. Several countries, as well as UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres, want accelerated action on emissions cuts this decade to keep the 1.5C goal alive. Experts and climate change campaigners have welcomed the commitments, but argued they need to be delivered on  - warning a previous deal in 2014 had ""failed to slow deforestation at all"". Similarly, activists have argued the deal on coal ""falls well short of the ambition needed"", as the ""small print gives countries enormous leeway"" to choose when to phase out the fossil fuel. How the world is reacting to COP26 Why we're marching in Glasgow Mr Johnson said: ""There is one week left for COP26 to deliver for the world, and we must all pull together and drive for the line."" He said nations had brought ""ambition and action to help limit rising temperatures"", and referred to the pledges that have been made during COP26 - including on deforestation and methane emissions. ""But we cannot underestimate the task at hand to keep 1.5C alive,"" he added. ""Countries must come back to the table this week ready to make the bold compromises and ambitious commitments needed."" Shadow business secretary Ed Miliband has warned the world is a ""long way off"" where it needs to be to take the ""major steps"" to ensure global warming does not exceed 1.5C. The Labour MP urged the prime minister to personally head up the negotiations in the final days of COP26, rather than engaging in ""empty exhortation and commentary"". He said: ""We have a right to expect him to engage directly in these final days, personally driving these negotiations forward, pushing all the major emitters to do more, delivering the finance required for developing and vulnerable countries and ensuring we have a path out of Glasgow to keep 1.5 alive. ""He needs to step up with focus, clarity and urgency in the face of the massive task the world faces in the coming days."" COP26 president Alok Sharma said the billions of dollars to restore the natural world that had been promised during the first week of the summit was humanity's ""first line of defence"" against the crisis. He told a news conference in Glasgow on Saturday that if the world reaches global warming of 1.5C above industrial levels, 70% of coral reefs would be lost.  If it gets to 2C, they would all die, he said. Mr Sharma said the UK will provide Â£500m to protect more than five million hectares of tropical rainforests and create thousands of green jobs across Africa, Asia and Latin America. The UK is also launching a Â£65m Just Rural Transition support programme to help communities move towards more sustainable methods of agriculture and food production, he added.
