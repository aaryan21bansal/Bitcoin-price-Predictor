"The chief Brexit negotiators for the UK and EU, Lord Frost and Michel Barnier The UK's new trade deal with the EU marks ""the beginning of a moment of national renewal"", Boris Johnson's chief Brexit negotiator has said. The agreement was announced on Christmas Eve, after months of fraught talks on issues such as fishing rights and business rules. Lord Frost described it as ""one of the biggest and broadest"" ever. MPs will vote on the deal in Parliament on 30 December, with the UK to exit existing trading rules on 31 December. The European Parliament also needs to ratify it, while EU ambassadorsreceived a Christmas Day briefing on the trade dealfrom EU negotiator Michel Barnier. A 1,246-page document, whichhas been published on the UK government's website,external, sets out the post-Brexit relationship with the EU and includes about 800 pages of annexes and footnotes. Quick guide to what's in the Brexit deal 10 things to look for in the Brexit deal Johnson gets the deal both sides wanted to achieve How Brexit will change your holidays in 2021 Speaking to reporters on Saturday, Lord Frost said: ""There's no more role for the European Court of Justice, there's no direct effects of EU law, there's no alignment of any kind, and we're out of the single market and out of the customs union just as the manifesto said we would. ""All choices are in our hands as a country and it's now up to us to decide how we use them and how we go forward in the future."" Senior members of the UK negotiating team added the deal allowed for a ""managed divergence"" fromEU rules and standards. A free trade agreement usually rules out tariffs being applied to imported goods. Under the terms of this deal if either party acts in a way the other views as anti-competitive, they can go to an independent arbitrator. If that doesn't resolve the complaint, either party can impose tariffs. The French Minister for Europe ClÃ©ment Beaune said: ""There is no country in the world that will be subject to as many export rules to us as the UK."" But the UK negotiators described the rules as ""standard"" for third party trade deals. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer - who campaigned against Brexit - said the deal did not provide adequate protections for jobs, manufacturing, financial services or workplace rights and was ""not the deal the government promised"". But with no time left to renegotiate, the only choice was between ""this deal or no deal"", he added. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen described it as ""fair"" and ""balanced"", saying it was now ""time to turn the page and look to the future"". Lord Frost certainly isn't underselling the agreement with Brussels, describing it as representing the ""beginning of a moment of national renewal"". Members of the Conservatives' European Research Group , or ERG - which includes many prominent Brexiteers - have sounded positive about the deal, as outlined by the PM. But some believe that the devil is in the detail. ERG lawyers - including the veteran Eurosceptic MP Sir Bill Cash - are set to dissect the contents of the agreement between now and Parliament's recall on Wednesday. But the former Brexit Secretary David Davis has said one day of scrutiny in Parliament isn't enough - and has accused the EU of having a habit of inserting ""little quirks"" into its treaties. Meanwhile,writing in the Times,external, Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove said the UK and EU would be able to enjoy a ""special relationship"" as a result of the new deal. He said the deal would give UK businesses ""certainty and the ability to plan for growth and investment"". ""We can develop a new pattern of friendly co-operation with the EU, a special relationship if you will, between sovereign equals,"" he added. But Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon accused the government of ""selling out"" Scottish fishing with the deal. Shetweeted,external: ""The Tories have sold out Scottish fishing all over again. ""Promises they knew couldn't be delivered, duly broken."" This video can not be played Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey: ""This look a very bad deal"" Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey told BBC Breakfast that the post-Brexit trade deal meant more of the red tape ""we all feared"", ""far more bureaucracy"" and was a ""defeat for those who wanted frictionless trade"". He said the deal was ""bad for business"", ""less safe"" for families and it was therefore ""insupportable"". Conservative MP and former cabinet minister Theresa Villiers, who voted for Brexit, told the same programme that ""many prime ministers"" had returned from negotiations with Brussels with deals that appear to ""do the right thing and then closer scrutiny demonstrates that they are not as good as first billed"". ""I hope that we have finally seen the pattern broken and I hope that this is a deal that I can support, but it is important that we scrutinise that detail carefully and take some expert advice on it,"" she said. Meanwhile, the Department for Education has announced further details of the Turing scheme which willreplace the Erasmus student exchange from September 2021. It will provide funding for around 35,000 students in universities, colleges and schools in the UK to go on placements and exchanges overseas, stretching beyond Europe with Â£100m set aside for 2021/22, the DfE said.

"Harsher Covid restrictions now apply to millions more people, as rule changes come into force across the UK. Around six million people in east and south-east England have gone into tier four, England's highest Covid level - which includes a ""stay at home"" order. Lockdowns have also started in Scotland and Northern Ireland, and measures have been reimposed in Wales after being eased for Christmas. It comes after official UK coronavirus deathspassed 70,000 on Christmas Day. The toughest measures - which mean the closure of all non-essential shops, as well as hairdressers, swimming pools and gyms - now apply to around 24 million people in England, more than 40% of the population. Meanwhile, work has continued in Kent to clear the backlog of lorries formed after France closed the border to the UK due to the discovery of a fast-spreading variant of coronavirus. The border has reopened but drivers must provide a negative Covid test before making the crossing, with the Department for Transport warning there were""still long queues"" on Saturday evening,external. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said more than 15,000 tests had now been carried out on lorry drivers, with 36 positive results. Prof Devi Sridhar, chairwoman of global public health at the University of Edinburgh, told the BBC she believed all of England was likely to soon be in tier four. ""I think that's where it's heading and it's better to be honest with people so they can plan the next few weeks to understand what might be coming,"" she said, adding: ""To really keep a handle on these numbers, you need to move early."" What are the lockdown and tier four rules from Boxing Day? Find out the rules where you live How many cases are there in your area? The whole of Sussex, Oxfordshire, Suffolk, Norfolk and Cambridgeshire, as well Essex, Waverley in Surrey, and all of Hampshire with the exception of the New Forest, are now in tier four. Bristol, Gloucestershire, Somerset, Swindon, the Isle of Wight, the New Forest and Northamptonshire, as well as Cheshire and Warrington, have all moved up to tier three. Meanwhile, Cornwall and Herefordshire have moved from tier one to tier two. Tier four restrictions mean shops in many town and city centres have been closed for the first time in decades on Boxing Day, when there are usually sales. Even some retailers deemed ""essential"" - such as Asda - have opted not to open. In Scotland - which operates under a different tier system - level four lockdown measures have come into force across the mainland for three weeks. Orkney, Shetland, the Western Isles and other island communities are in level three. And in Northern Ireland, a six-week lockdown has begun. The first week, until 2 January, has stricter restrictions, including essential shops closing at 20:00 GMT and no sport. For the first week, people are also banned from meeting indoors or outdoors between 20:00 and 06:00. NI police have legally-enforceable powers to tell anyone out during those hours to return home, unless they have a ""reasonable excuse"", such as being a key worker or having caring responsibilities. On Saturday, the UK government announced a further 34,693 people had tested positive for Covid-19 in England and Scotland, while a further 210 people had died within 28 days of a positive test in England.

"This video can not be played Trump asked Congress to amend the Covid aid bill earlier this week Millions of Americans have temporarily lost their unemployment benefits after President Donald Trump failed to sign the Covid relief bill into law. US President-elect Joe Biden had warned of ""devastating consequences"" if Mr Trump continued to delay signing but the Saturday deadline has now passed. Unemployment benefits and a ban on evictions will be affected. The package worth $900bn (Â£665bn) was approved by Congress after months of difficult negotiations and compromises. Mr Trump says he wants to give people bigger one-off payments. Late on Sunday he tweeted that there was ""good news"" on the bill, but did not give any details. Allow Twitter content?

The bill includes the payment of $600 to Americans earning less than $75,000 a year. Mr Trump says he wants Americans to receive $2,000 but Republicans in Congress refused to agree to the change. In a tweet late on Saturday evening local time, Mr Trump again defended his position on the issue, blaming China for the coronavirus outbreak. Hunger spikes, demand rises for US food banks Unemployed in the US: 'I donât know what to do' Counting down the days to losing a home The coronavirus economic relief is part of a $2.3tn spending package that includes $1.4tn for normal federal government spending. A partial government shutdown will begin on Tuesday unless legislators pass a stopgap bill before then - but this would not include coronavirus aid and Mr Trump would still have to sign it. About 14 million Americans would be affectedby a lapse in unemployment benefit payments and new stimulus cheques. In a strongly worded statement published on the transition website on Saturday, Mr Biden described Mr Trump's refusal to sign the bill as an ""abdication of responsibility"". ""It is the day after Christmas, and millions of families don't know if they'll be able to make ends meet because of President Donald Trump's refusal to sign an economic relief bill approved by Congress with an overwhelming and bipartisan majority,"" Mr Biden said. This video can not be played ""I'm not sure how we're going to survive"" He praised the example of members of Congress in compromising and reaching a bipartisan agreement, adding: ""President Trump should join them, and make sure millions of Americans can put food on the table and keep a roof over their heads in this holiday season."" On Twitter earlier, the president had reiterated his objection to the bill, saying: ""I simply want to get our great people $2000, rather than the measly $600 that is now in the bill."" The coronavirus aid relief bill - with the larger budget bill rolled in - overwhelmingly passed the House of Representatives and Senate on Monday but, a day later, Mr Trump issued an implied veto threat, describing the package as a ""disgrace"" full of ""wasteful"" items. A woman and her daughter receiving food aid in Florida this month He baulked at the annual aid money for other countries in the federal budget, arguing that those funds should instead go to struggling Americans. Mr Trump's decision to bat the measure back to Capitol Hill stunned lawmakers since he has largely stayed out of negotiations for a coronavirus aid bill that had stalled since last July. His top economic adviser, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, had proposed the $600 payments early this month, and many have questioned why the president waited until now to object. The fate of the spending package remains in the balance while Mr Trump refuses to sign it. He spent Saturday at his Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida with his family, where he held ""many meetings and calls"", according to his schedule. The White House said it had no update on the prospect of Mr Trump signing the bill by Monday, an official quoted by Reuters news agency said. Because it includes money to fund the federal government through to September 2021, a government shutdown looms on Tuesday unless a stopgap bill is passed and signed by the president. But that would not cover the coronavirus aid package, leaving millions of families in peril. The House of Representatives, controlled by the Democrats, plans to vote on Monday on a standalone bill that would provide the $2,000 cheques to Americans. On the same day, the House is also expected to vote on an unrelated, $740bn defence spending bill, which Mr Trump vetoed on Wednesday instead of signing into law. Lawmakers plan to override the president's veto and enact the legislation anyway, but to do so they need two-thirds of votes in both the House and Senate.

"This video can not be played Watch the aftermath of the explosion in Nashville Businesses and TV personalities have offered more than $300,000 (Â£224,000) to catch those responsible for a camper van blast in the US city of Nashville. The explosion rocked the city early on Christmas Day, injuring three people and knocking out communications systems across the state of Tennessee. Police believe the powerful blast was caused deliberately. Law enforcement agents have searched the home of a possible person of interest in nearby Antioch. No motive has yet been established for the explosion, and no-one has yet said they were behind it. Possible human remains have been found near the blast site. Law enforcement officers searched the property of a possible person of interest in Antioch FBI Special Agent in Charge Douglas Korneski said officials had received about 500 tips and that they were looking at a ""number of individuals"" in possible connection to the explosion. Officers from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives are also involved in the investigation. Earlier, Tennessee Governor Bill Lee said he toured the site, saying on Twitter it was a ""miracle"" that no-one had been killed. He said he had asked President Donald Trump for a federal emergency declaration for his state to aid relief efforts. The FBI is leading the investigation into the explosion Businessman Marcus Lemonis is the latest to donate to a reward pot, pledging $250,000. ""We can't have our streets terrorised like this,"" tweeted Mr Lemonis, who hosts reality TV show The Profit. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Officers responded to reports of gunshots just before 06:00 local time (12:00 GMT) on Christmas Day in an area of the city known for its restaurants and nightlife. Shortly afterwards, they found a camper van broadcasting a warning message to leave the area. The van exploded a few minutes later, the force of the blast knocking an officer off their feet, police said. It is still unclear if anyone was inside the camper van at the time.

"China is the only major global economy that will have expanded in 2020 China will overtake the US to become the world's largest economy by 2028, five years earlier than previously forecast, a report says. The UK-based Centre for Economics and Business Research (CEBR) said China's ""skilful"" management of Covid-19 would boost its relative growth compared to the US and Europe in coming years. Meanwhile India is tipped to become the third largest economy by 2030. The CEBR releases its economic league table,externalevery year on 26 December. Although China was the first country hit by Covid-19, it controlled the disease through swift and extremely strict action, meaning it did not need to repeat economically paralysing lockdowns as European countries have done. As a result, unlike other major economies, it has avoided an economic recession in 2020 and is in fact estimated to see growth of 2% this year. 'China is a hard rock. It won't be beaten by virus' Millions of Americans face jobless benefits lapse The US economy, by contrast, has been hit hard by the world's worst coronavirus epidemic in terms of sheer numbers. More than 330,000 people have died in the US and there have been some 18.5 million confirmed cases. The economic damage has been cushioned by monetary policy and a huge fiscal stimulus, but political disagreements over a new stimulus package could leave around 14 million Americans without unemployment benefit payments in the new year. ""For some time, an overarching theme of global economics has been the economic and soft power struggle between the United States and China,"" says the CEBR report. ""The Covid-19 pandemic and corresponding economic fallout have certainly tipped this rivalry in China's favour."" This video can not be played How US and China's break-up could affect the world The report says that after ""a strong post-pandemic rebound in 2021"", the US economy will grow by about 1.9% annually from 2022-24 and then slow to 1.6% in the years after that. By contrast the Chinese economy is tipped to grow by 5.7% annually until 2025, and 4.5% annually from 2026-2030. China's share of the world economy has risen from just 3.6% in 2000 to 17.8% now and the country will become a ""high-income economy"" by 2023, the report says. The Chinese economy is not only benefitting from having controlled Covid-19 early, but also aggressive policymaking targeting industries like advanced manufacturing, said CEBR deputy chairman Douglas McWilliams. ""They seem to be trying to have centralised control at one level, but quite a free market economy in other areas,"" he told the BBC. ""And it's the free market bit that's helping them move forward particularly in areas like tech."" But the average Chinese person will remain far poorer in financial terms than the average American even after China becomes the world's biggest economy, given that China's population is four times bigger. The post-Brexit UK economy will grow by 4% annually from 2021-25 and 1.8% annually from 2026-30 (after shrinking in 2020) India had overtaken the UK as the fifth-biggest economy in 2019 but has slipped behind it again due to the pandemic's impact. It won't take over again until 2024, the CEBR says India's economy will go on to overtake Germany in 2027 and Japan in 2030 Millions of Americans face jobless benefits lapse At least 10 confirmed dead in Los Angeles wildfires What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

Sheff Utd 0-1 Everton Sheffield United Sheffield United's John Egan:""We are disappointed, the lads gave everything. We probably didn't show the quality we can which is part of the frustration. ""Last season is gone, it is in the past. We have lost a lot of games this year by one goal and if you can make comparisons we were winning those last year."" Manchester City 2-0 Newcastle United Manchester City Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola to BBC Sport:""We played really well, the tempo we have to play football is this tempo. A lot of passes and the ball goes to where you are. Imagine the ball will come. ""Raheem Sterling took a look, he didn't cross, he passed the ball and that's why we scored the first goal. Today was the best game of the season for players being in the position they have to be in. ""The way you play shows the results you will get in our team. Today was the day that we have done it best. Build from here, in 45 hours we have another game at Goodison Park. ""Tomorrow the players have to regenerate and prepare in one day. This pandemic puts us in an extreme situation, but that's how England likes it so we accept it."" Sheff Utd 0-1 Everton Everton Everton boss Carlo Ancelotti:""We were patient. We were in the game and stayed in the game most times, we defended pretty well and we found the right opportunity to score a goal. ""Every game is really difficult, complicated. Sheffield United are a good team, we are really pleased to be second. We didn't expect that at the start of the season but we are there and we want to stay there. ""The squad we have is good. We have a lot of important players out. With these players back we can still have a really good season, we don't have to think about the transfer window in January. ""We are there, we are pleased to be there but we don't have a lot of time to think about it. We have another game in two days, we push."" Sheff Utd 0-1 Everton Sheffield United Sheffield United boss Chris Wilder, speaking to BBC Sport:""It was the same as possibly a good dozen of the games we have played this season. It was a game of not many chances, we were playing a side bang in form but our lack of quality shone through. ""The same players that played with that momentum and belief from last year are not doing it this year. Nothing has really changed, the league hasn't changed, Everton haven't really changed but our team has in terms of the lack of quality we are showing this year. ""I can't go and play the game for them. One system against the other, we changed it a little bit but for me it is the same again, it is our lack of quality that let us down. ""There will not be the possibility of bringing many players in. We are looking to add one or two bits of quality. The players who are here are good enough to step up because they did it last year but they have to find that in themselves. ""Good experienced players who have played at this level for a season are not sticking their hand up and making my job easier. ""I'll pack it in if I ever feel I have to motivate a side in the Premier League. That shouldn't be my job but the players need to go and express themselves and play with a bit of belief."" Sheff Utd 0-1 Everton Sheffield United Sheffield United's Ben Osborn, speaking to BT Sport:""The lads are all motivated, we can't be any more motivated. We are embarrassed to be in this position, records we don't want, we just need that first result. ""The last few weeks' performances have been there, we are not lacking motivation we just need to roll our sleeves up and keep going."" Can Sheffield United stay up?""It is going to be really, really tough. We just need to get that first win first."" Sheff Utd 0-1 Everton Everton Everton boss Carlo Ancelotti, speaking to BBC Sport:""We defended well but also we didn't play so well with the ball but defensively we were strong and concentrated. These three points are very important for us. ""When I put on Andre Gomes I put Gylfi Sigurdsson a little bit back but he found the solution. ""We feel good also because we have problems at this moment with a lot of players out but this team has a lot of spirit and this is good. I am really pleased to manage these players. ""I am really pleased because I found the right club, a nice club a family club. I live in  a nice area so after one year I can say I was lucky."" Manchester City 2-0 Newcastle United Manchester City Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola:""A tough game, the weather conditions and the opponent who we have struggled to score against. ""That is the tempo we need to play. Today our positional game was perfect, unfortunately we could not score more goals but it is a good result and three more points. ""We cannot think much, the schedule is a game every three days. The players are committed and focused. ""We are far away from the top, last week we were 10th in the table, all the season is up and down. There are weird results for everyone, this season you have to be calm in the good and the bad moments."" Sheffield United 0-1 Everton Sheffield United Sheffield United (W0-D2-L13) have equalled the worst record by a club after 15 fixtures in one of the top four tiers of English football:  The 1970 bottom divison was a wild one! Sheff Utd 0-1 Everton Sheffield United Sheffield United boss Chris Wilder, speaking to BT Sport:""It is obviously a difficult period for everyone at this football club. It is another game against a top side that has been close and we feel we should have got something out of. ""When we had the opportunity to open up and show a bit of quality we haven't done that. That has been the story of the season - not showing the quality we showed last season. ""Regarding motivation I will pack it in if I have to motivate the players, there is no issue with the motivation it is the quality, I can't put that quality into them. I can't play the game for them, I'm not chucking them under the bus but they need to show the quality. ""I'll scratch my head yet again, I'll try something to see if there's anything different. In the Premier League you have to produce to get any sort of result. If we showed any quality at the big times in and out of possession we would be nowhere near the points we are on but we are.  Manchester City 2-0 Newcastle United Newcastle United Newcastle manager Steve Bruce to BBC Sport: ""It was a difficult night but the way they played, I've got no problems with it. ""Fabian Schar has trained once in five weeks but wanted to play, the attitude of them all was there to see. We have got a large chunk of players missing. I don't want to make excuses but we are struggling for numbers. ""We had to respond to heavy criticism and made a fist of it. We weren't good enough on the night but we tried to stay in the game and it was a huge improvement. ""Jonjo Shelvey had a groin injury and he is not right, he has played too many games. We will see if we can get a few back, once we do I'm sure we will be OK.""  Manchester City 2-0 Newcastle United Here comes Pep Guardiola for his post-match chat. He was wearing a massive coat all night but still his hoody underneath is soaked around the arms and chest. He looks like a Neighbours character who has been for a morning run. Manchester City 2-0 Newcastle United Newcastle United Newcastle manager Steve Bruce:""The attitude was pleasing after a difficult week or so, you always know you will come here against a world-class team and we were beaten by the better side. ""It was a decent performance. The game in midwek has gone, we needed to respond to the criticism and they have done as much as they could. They rolled their sleeves up and had a go. ""You accept mistakes, the one thing I wanted to see was a response from a poor display in midweek and they did that. ""We've had big problems which seems to have gone unnoticed and we need a fit and healthy squad back soon. It has been a struggle.""

""We needed to get three points, we knew it would be tough coming here. I think they have been quite unlucky this season, they have been in a lot of games where they have lost by the one goal so they are not a bad team.

"George Blake told the BBC he had betrayed more than 500 Western agents to the Soviet Union George Blake, the former MI6 officer and one of the Cold War's most infamous double agents, has died aged 98, Russian media has reported. Over nine years, the Soviet spy handed over information that led to the betrayal of at least 40 MI6 agents in Eastern Europe. He was jailed in London in 1960, but escaped in 1966 and fled to Russia. The Russian Foreign Intelligence Service said Blake ""had a genuine love for our country"". His death, reported by Russia's state-owned news agency RIA Novosti, was confirmed by Sergei Ivanov, the head of the press bureau of the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR). Russian president Vladimir Putin described him as an ""outstanding professional of special courage and life endurance"". ""Throughout the years of his hard and strenuous efforts he made a truly invaluable contribution to ensuring the strategic parity and the preservation of peace on the planet,"" he said in a message of condolence. ""Our hearts will always cherish the warm memory of this legendary man."" Obituary: George Blake Blake was born George Behar on 11 November 1922 in the Dutch city of Rotterdam. His father was a Spanish Jew who had fought with the British army during World War One and acquired British citizenship. Blake himself worked for the Dutch resistance during World War Two, before fleeing to British-controlled Gibraltar. He was later, due to his background, asked to join the intelligence service. Blake in 1953 In an interview with the BBC in 1990, Blake said he estimated that he betrayed more than 500 Western agents but he denied suggestions that 42 of them had lost their lives as a result of his actions. His downfall came when a Polish secret service officer, Michael Goleniewski, defected to the West, bringing his mistress and details of a Soviet mole in British intelligence. Blake was recalled to London and arrested. At a subsequent trial he pleaded guilty to five counts of passing information to the Soviet Union. George Blake did enormous damage to British intelligence operations during the Cold War, betraying agents and secret operations and showing that the KGB could run agents within the heart of the British state. His escape from prison added to the embarrassment. The reasons behind Blake's actions sometimes seemed mysterious, particularly his initial recruitment. When I contacted him a decade ago, he told me: ""It is no longer of particular importance to me whether my motivations are generally understood or not."" Part of the problem for him was that he had chosen communism but lived to see its collapse and the end of the Soviet Union, living out his days in Russia, where he was still seen as a hero by the successors to the KGB. In 1995, Blake's escape from HMP Wormwood Scrubs became the focus of the play Cell Mates, starring Stephen Fry and Rik Mayall. And in 2015, the BBC documentary Masterspy of Moscow followed what it called ""the strange life"" of an ""enigmatic traitor"".

"All airline passengers arriving in the US from the UK are to be required to test negative for Covid-19 within 72 hours of departure amid concerns about a new coronavirus variant. From 28 December travellers will need to provide written documentation of their test result to airlines. Other countries have shut their borders to UK flights because of the variant. But its rapid spread has also led to stricter rules in the UK, including a ban on overseas trips for many Britons. And US airlines have drastically scaled back flying to the UK and Europe, after the entry of most foreign nationals was suspended at the start of the pandemic. Health officials say there is no evidence the new variant is more deadly, or would react differently to vaccines, but it is proving to be up to 70% more transmissible. New coronavirus variant: What do we know? The decision by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to require testing came afterNew York City introduced quarantine rules for international travellersin response to the variant. The CDC said passengers must test negative via either a PCR (polymerase chain reaction) or an antigen test. Since Thursday, passengers travelling with Delta Air Lines andVirgin Atlantic,externalon UK flights to the US have already been required to provide a negative test taken within 72 hours before departure.

"This video can not be played The Pfizer vaccine must be stored in ultra-low temperatures Cases of the more contagious variant of Covid-19 first identified in the UK have been confirmed in several European countries as well as Canada and Japan. Infections linked to people who arrived from the UK were reported in Spain, Switzerland, Sweden and France. A couple found infected in Ontario, Canada, had no known travel history or high-risk contacts, officials say. Japan is to ban most non-resident foreign nationals from entering the country for a month from Monday. People in Tokyo on Saturday Since reporting infections in five passengers who had all arrived from the UK, the country has confirmed two more cases, one of which is said to have been domestically transmitted. News of the new variant triggered travel restrictions around the worldlast week. Meanwhile, several EU countries have started to vaccinate people against the virus ahead of a co-ordinated rollout across the whole bloc on Sunday. Health workers in north-east Germany said they were not prepared to wait another day to distribute the newly approved Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. They began by immunising elderly residents of a nursing home in Halberstadt. In Hungary, the state news agency said the first recipient of the vaccine was a doctor at Del-Pest Central Hospital. The authorities in Slovakia also said they had begun vaccinating. The head of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, has released a video on Twitter celebrating the vaccine rollout,calling it a ""touching moment of unity.,external Coronavirus variants: The science explained UK has two cases of variant linked to South Africa Fresh air: The forgotten coronavirus weapon Scientists say the new variant of Covid-19 may have been spotted in the UK firstbecause of the strength of the country's surveillance system. The new variant is considerably more transmissible than previous strains but not necessarily any more dangerous for those infected, experts say. Those infected inCanadaare a couple from Durham, near Toronto, who are now self-isolating. In Japan, the two new cases are a pilot in his 30s who returned to Japan from London on 16 December and a woman in her 20s,external, one of his family members with no history of visiting the country, Kyodo News reports. Underthe travel suspension coming in on Monday,external, Japanese nationals and non-Japanese residents who are abroad will be allowed to return, andsome travellers such as businesspeople will be allowed to enter from a small number of mainly Asian countries,external. InSpain, four cases of the new variant were confirmed in Madrid. None of the patients, all of whom travelled from the UK, were seriously ill. Switzerlandidentified three cases, two of which are known to be British citizens currently in the country. Switzerland is alone in Europe in keeping its ski slopes open to tourism over the Christmas and New Year period, and thousands of tourists from Britain have arrived in the last couple of weeks. InSweden, the health agency said a traveller there was ill with the strain but had been self-isolating since he returned from the UK. This video can not be played What a pandemic Christmas looked like around the world Franceconfirmed its first case of the new variant - a French citizen in the central town of Tours who had arrived from London on 19 December, the health ministry said. The man, who had been living in the UK, was asymptomatic and currently self-isolating at home, the ministry said. France closed its border with the UK after the new variant was confirmed in Britain but ended its ban for EU citizens on Wednesday, providing people tested negative before travelling. Thousands of lorry drivers spent Christmas Day in their cabs in Kent waiting to cross the English Channel. Cases inDenmark,Germany,Italy, theNetherlandsandAustraliawere reported earlier. The new variant first detected in southern England in September is blamed for sharp rises in levels of positive tests in recent weeks in London, south-east England and the east of England About two-thirds of people testing positive in these areas could have the new variant - but this is only an estimate, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) says. This video can not be played Covid symptoms: What are they and how long should I self-isolate for? Three things are coming together that mean the new variant is attracting attention: It is rapidly replacing other versions of the virus It has mutations that affect part of the virus likely to be important Some of those mutations have already been shown in the lab to increase the ability of the virus to infect cells All of these build a case for a virus that can spread more easily, says the BBC's health and science correspondent, James Gallagher.

"The UK-EU trade agreement, which contains new rules for living, working and trading together, takes effect from 23:00 GMT on 31 December. The full complicated agreement ismore than 1,200 pages long,,externalbut here are some of the key points. What the deal says There will be no taxes on goods (tariffs) or limits on the amount that can be traded (quotas) between the UK and the EU from 1 January Some new checks will be introduced at borders, such as safety checks and customs declarations. There are some newrestrictions on certain UK animal food products,external. For example, uncooked meats like sausages and burgers can't enter the EU unless they are frozen to -18C. What does that mean? Having a deal in place means that the fear that some goods could become more expensive has been avoided. However, businesses will still need to prepare for new procedures at ports, and if new paperwork is incomplete,it could lead to disruption. What the deal says: Businesses offering services, such as banking, architecture and accounting, will lose their automatic right of access to EU markets and will face some restrictions. There will no longer be automatic recognition of professional qualifications for people such as doctors, chefs and architects. What does that mean? Rather than following one set of rules for the whole of the EU, UK businesses will need to comply with the regulations in each individual country. It will be harder for people with qualifications gained in the UK to sell their services in the EU. Individuals will need to check each country's rules to make sure their qualification is still recognised. However, the UK and EU have pledged to keep talking to try to improve access for the service sector in the future. What the deal says: UK nationals will need a visa for stays of longer than90 days in the EU in a 180-day period. EUpet passportswill no longer be valid. European Health Insurance Cards, (EHIC) cardswill remain valid until they expire. The UK is no longer subject to the ban on additional roaming charges, although both sides will encourage operators to have""transparent and reasonable rates"" for roaming. What does that mean? The UK government says EHIC will be replaced with a newUK Global Health Insurance Card,external, but full details have not been released yet. Pets will still be allowed in the EU, but it will be a more complicated process as owners will need to obtain an animal health certificate for each trip they make. UK mobile operators will be able to charge for roaming, so people should check with their mobile phone company before travelling. What the deal says: Over the next five-and-a-half years,the UK will gradually gain a greater share of the fish from its own waters. The UK could choose to ban EU fishing boats from 2026, but the EU would be allowed to introduce taxes on British fish in response. What does that mean? Fishing was the hardest and last issue to be resolved in the negotiation, and some UK fishermen are unhappy with the arrangement. The Scottish Fishermen's Federation, for example, says the deal does not give the UK enough control of its waters. Starting in 2026, the UK and the EU will hold regular talks on fishing access. So there could be more heated arguments ahead. What the deal says: There will be no role in the UK for the European Court of Justice (ECJ), which is the highest court in the EU. Disputes that cannot be resolved between the UK and the EU will be referred to an independent tribunal instead. What does that mean? Ending the role of the ECJ was a key UK demand as Brexit supporters said it would allow the UK to ""take back control"" of its laws. The ECJ could still have a role in Northern Ireland because it continues to follow some EU trade rules. If either side moves too far away from the current rules around product standards, tariffs (charges on imports) could be imposed on some goods in the future. What the deal says: The UK will no longer have automatic access to key security databases, but should be able to gain access upon request. The UK will not be a member of the EU's law enforcement agency, Europol, but it will have a presence at its headquarters. The UK is no longer obliged to comply with EU standards of data protection, but data will continue to be exchanged in the same way for at least four months as long as the UK doesn't change its data protection rules. What does that mean? The UK's arrangement with Europol will be similar to the one the US currently has. Many of the rules about storing and processing data still need be decided. What the deal says: The UK will no longer participatein the Erasmus exchange programme, an EU scheme that helps students study in other countries. Students at universities in Northern Ireland will continue to participate in Erasmus, as part of an arrangement with the Irish government. What does that mean? Students that have already started courses in the EU will continue to receive support for fees. A new scheme named after the mathematician Alan Turing,externalwill begin in September 2021. The government says it will be similar to Erasmus but will include countries across the world.

"This video can not be played Queenâs Christmas Speech 2020: âYou are not aloneâ The Queen's Christmas message - which focused on hope amid the pandemic - topped TV ratings on Christmas Day, overnight viewing figures have shown. An audience of 8.14 million watched her festive address on BBC One, ITV and Sky News. BBC One's Call The Midwife had the second highest number of viewers, with an average audience of 5.43 million, and 5.26m tuned in for Blankety Blank. Last year, the return of sitcom Gavin and Stacey topped the ratings. According to ratings body Barb, Strictly Come Dancing, which featured the show's 25 most memorable dances, and Michael McIntyre's The Wheel were in fourth and fifth place with 4.86 million viewers and 4.66 million respectively. ITV's highest rated programme was Coronation Street with 4.55 million viewers, making it number six on the ratings list. TV in 2021: Shows coming to the small screen 'You are not alone' says Queen in Christmas speech The popular soap beat BBC One rival EastEnders - which was in ninth place with 3.54 million viewers, meaning it was beaten by another soap rival, Emmerdale. That is a far cry from festive episodes gone by for EastEnders, which was once the powerhouse of the BBC's Christmas offering - including famously in 1986 when more than 30 million tuned in to see Den Watts, played by Leslie Grantham, hand divorce papers to wife Angie, played by Anita Dobson. The Strictly Come Dancing Christmas special had 4.86 million viewers TV star Bradley Walsh, who hosted the Blankety Blank Christmas special, made a second appearance on the list with his quiz show The Chase, in at 10th place with 3.02m viewers. In recent years, The Queen's annual broadcast has regularly been the most-watched TV show, based on the overnight figures - which do not include viewers who watch Christmas specials on catch-up services during the rest of the festive period. This year, the 94-year-old, who like many was spending Christmas Day apart from her family, used her message to reassure anyone struggling without friends and family that they ""are not alone"". She said what many people want ""for Christmas is a simple hug or a squeeze of the hand"" - but ""even on the darkest nights there is hope in the new dawn"". She also praised acts of kindness, saying the pandemic ""brought us closer"" despite causing hardship. 1. The Queen - 8.14m (BBC One, ITV 1, Sky One, Sky News, BBC News) 2. Call The Midwife - 5.43m (BBC One) 3. Blankety Blank - 5.26m (BBC One) 4. Strictly Come Dancing - 4.86m (BBC One) 5. Michael McIntyre - 4.66m (BBC One) 6. Coronation Street - 4.55m (ITV) 7. Mrs Brown's Boys - 3.81m (BBC One) 8. Emmerdale - 3.57m (ITV) 9. EastEnders - 3.54m (BBC One) 10. The Chase - 3.02m (ITV) Kate Phillips, acting controller of BBC One said: ""I'm really proud of the range and quality of programmes we've shown across this special day,"" she said. ""BBC One entertained the nation and provided something for everyone to enjoy after a particularly difficult year."" TV presenter Bradley Walsh has two shows in the top ten By Lizo Mzimba, entertainment correspondent Christmas Day was an excellent day for Bradley Walsh. He helped ITV to a stronger top 10 presence than they've enjoyed in over five years, with The Chase joining Coronation Street and Emmerdale in the day's most watched shows. The last time the broadcaster had three top 10 programmes was back in 2014 with Downton Abbey alongside the two soaps. (But they'll have been disappointed that Britain's Got Talent couldn't break the three million mark and also scrape into the top 10). And Walsh also ""switched channels"" during the day to help BBC One's reboot of Blankety Blank into third place. A rare strong Christmas Day showing for a game show, and one which could well persuade the BBC to commission a full series return. Overall, the 2020 Christmas Day figures do seem to reflect the gradual decline in viewing that we've seen in recent years. While it's undoubtedly true that the explosion of streaming services and other non-TV related activities has drawn away much of the traditional 25 December audience, it's also worth noting a few other factors. This year there wasn't anything like the return of a much-loved show like Gavin and Stacey, which last year performed exceptionally, with 11.6m ""overnight"" viewers. A massive figure by any standards. Also, Christmas Day is thought of as being a time when families gather to watch TV. But this year, the pandemic means that many families haven't been allowed to or have chosen not to be together, something that is likely to have had an impact on that traditional part of the audience. But the Queen's broadcast remains a unifying moment for many, and is unsurprisingly comfortably at the top of this year's viewing chart.

"A near-deserted Regent Street in London as the Boxing Day sales began Boxing Day sales are expected to plummet after Covid-19 restrictions meant shops in many areas were forced to stay closed. By midday, footfall was down 60% across the UK compared with last year, according to experts Springboard. Stricter measures havebeen introduced in much of the UKwith 40% of England's population now under tier four rules, meaning non-essential shops must shut. Analysts said footfall had dropped even where other retailers could open. National lockdowns in Wales and Northern Ireland, as well as most of mainland Scotland being placed into its own level four restrictions, meant non-essential stores are forced to be closed on what is traditionally a big day in the retail calendar. What are the lockdown and tier four rules from Boxing Day? Empty streets on Boxing Day in lockdown Wales Business review of 2020: Covid-19 and Trump Footfall in tier four regions of England fell by 77.3% compared with last year, and even in tier two and three areas where shops are open, footfall was down by 38.2% and 42.4% respectively, according to Springboard, which analyses customer activity in stores. An estimated Â£2.7bn will be spent by UK shoppers by the end of 26 December, with each consumer planning to spend an average of Â£162 online, according to research from Barclaycard, down from last year's projection of spending an average of Â£186 each and a total of Â£3.7bn. Jace Tyrrell, chief executive of the New West End Company which represents 600 retail and leisure businesses in the capital, described the scenes as ""heartbreaking"", with the London district empty on Boxing Day for the first time since 1871. Mr Tyrrell said the days around Christmas are usually ""the key golden period"" for sales but tier four restrictions have had a ""huge impact"". He said coronavirus had cost the West End 80% of its usual year-on-year sales, with Â£2bn forecast to be lost during the Christmas period. Diane Wehrle, insights director at Springboard, said while the losses from reduced footfall will be offset a little by virtual ""comfort-buying"", for the majority of retailers ""the sales they get online are much smaller than what they get in-store"". Last year's post-Christmas sales also saw a drop in footfall with Springboardseeing an 8.6% decline, the largest since 2011.

"Restrictions have been increased in Edinburgh and across Scotland to curb the new strain of coronavirus Mainland Scotland has moved into the toughest level of coronavirus restrictions. Millions of people are now living under level four curbs - the highest of the country's five-tier system of anti-virus measures. The change means non-essential retail and hospitality have been closed and additional travel restrictions imposed to curb a new strain of the virus. The restrictions are due to be reviewed in three weeks. Those living in Orkney, Shetland and the Western Isles, along with other island communities off the Scottish mainland, are subject to level three measures. Latest Scottish government figures,externalshowed on Saturday that 1,149 new cases of Covid-19 have been reported across the country. First Minister Nicola Sturgeonhas warned that level four restrictions could be further tightenedif efforts to reduce the spread of the new transmissible strain of coronavirus were unsuccessful. At an emergency briefing last week,Ms Sturgeon said ""firm preventative action"" was neededafter the emergence of the faster-spreading strain, which is currently responsible for more than one in three cases of Covid-19. What level are you in from Boxing Day? Scottish level four rules 'may be strengthened' It comes as concerns were raised about an outbreak of thenew strain in south-west Scotland. Health officials say 64 cases of coronavirus have now been identified in Wigtownshire, with another confirmed in lower Annandale. Level four restriction took effect from 26 December and followeda 24-hour period of relaxed rulesfor Christmas Day. For one day only on 25 December, bubbles were formed with other households and travel restrictions were eased. However all but essential travel is now banned outside your local authority area for the remainder of the festive period. Figures for deaths, hospital admissions and intensive care cases associated with coronavirus will next be updated on 29 December. Schools will return later than originally planned after the Christmas holidays. Ms Sturgeon said they should resume from 11 January, with learning taking place online until at least 18 January. The new variant was first seen in mid-September in London and Kent - but by December it had become the ""dominant variant"" in London. Government advisers believe the new variant could increase the R number - or reproductive rate of the virus - by 0.4 or more. Nicola Sturgeon said there was no evidence to suggest the new strain made people sicker than earlier variants, or that it would change the effectiveness of the vaccine. When the Boxing Day restrictions were announced, Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said families would be ""devastated"", but that he understood why the restrictions were necessary. ""None of us want this, but these sacrifices will save lives,"" he said. Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard said the Scottish government needed to publish ""persuasive evidence"" to avert a ""heightened risk of non-compliance"". The Scottish Liberal Democrats and the Scottish Greens both backed the moves. LEVELS:What are the restrictions in your area?

"The global fleet of Boeing 737s underwent an overhaul following two fatal crashes in 2019 An Air Canada Boeing 737 Max aircraft has been forced to make an unscheduled landing after developing engine trouble, the airline has said. The plane was en route from the US state of Arizona to Montreal in Canada when it was diverted shortly after take-off, Air Canada said. The plane was carrying three crew members at the time and landed safely. 737 Max aircraft were grounded in 2019 after two fatal crashes, but resumed flying this month after an overhaul. The crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia came within five months of each other and together killed 346 people. The accidents were attributed to flaws in automated flight software called MCAS, which prompted the planes to nosedive. This video can not be played Zipporah Kuria's father Joseph Waithaka was one of 157 people killed when a Boeing 737 Max crashed in March 2019 The latest incident happened on Friday. In a statement, Air Canada said the pilots ""received an engine notification and, according to the standard operating procedure for such a situation, they decided to shut down an engine"" before rerouting to Tucson, Arizona. According to Belgian aviation news site aviation.be, the crew were alerted to ""left engine hydraulic low pressure"" followed by ""an indication of a fuel imbalance"" from the left-hand wing, at which point they diverted.,external The aircraft, with no passengers on board, was being flown from a storage site. It remains on the ground in Tucson. 'Boeing played Russian roulette with peopleâs lives' In the wake of the two crashes, Boeing implemented a series of modifications including updating flight control software, revising crew procedures and rerouting internal wiring.

"Michael Gove said he has seen ""seen old friendships crumble"" since the Brexit vote The UK and EU will be able to enjoy a ""special relationship"" as a result of the post-Brexit trade deal, Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove has said. Writing in the Times,external, Mr Gove said he hoped the agreement will also see politics move away from the bitterness surrounding the 2016 referendum. He wrote: ""We can now embark on a new, more hopeful, chapter in our history."" It comes as EU ambassadors received a Christmas Day briefing on the trade deal from EU negotiator Michel Barnier. Mr Barnier updated them on the agreement, which was reached on Christmas Eve after months of fraught talks on issues such as fishing rights and business rules. MPs will vote on the deal in Parliament on 30 December, with the UK set to exit existing trading rules on 31 December. A 1,246-page document,which has been published on the UK government's website,external, sets out the post-Brexit trade deal with the EU and includes about 800 pages of annexes and footnotes. 10 things to look for in the Brexit deal Johnson gets the deal both sides wanted to achieve How Brexit will change your holidays in 2021 What the PM's mistake tells us about our future Writing in the Times newspaper, Mr Gove, who was a leading campaigner for the Brexit vote in the 2016 referendum, said he ""won't deny it's been difficult"" for many people since then. ""Friendships have been strained, families were divided and our politics has been rancorous and, at times, ugly. Through the past four years, as a politician at the centre of this debate, I've made more than my share of mistakes or misjudgements, seen old friendships crumble and those closest to me have to endure pressures they never anticipated."" He said he had felt ""conscious of a responsibility"" to deliver Brexit, adding: ""I asked people to vote Leave so they could have their voices heard."" One of the most difficult issues in the negotiations was fishing Mr Gove said the deal would give UK businesses ""certainty and the ability to plan for growth and investment"". ""We can develop a new pattern of friendly co-operation with the EU, a special relationship if you will, between sovereign equals,"" he added. ""The greatest prize, however, is the chance now to renew our country and help it to recover from the ravages of the Covid-19 pandemic in a spirit of shared endeavour and solidarity. We have a duty to spread opportunity more equally across the UK. Outside the EU, with a good trade deal in place, we can tackle the injustices and inequalities that have held Britain back."" A Brexit deal has been agreed, days before a deadline.It means that the UK and the EU can continue to trade without extra taxes being put on goods - but we don't know all the details yet. What took so long?The UK voted to leave the EU in 2016 and actually left on 31 January 2020, but leaders had until the end of 2020 to work out a trade deal. There are big changes ahead.Although it's a trade deal that has been agreed, there will also be changes to how people travel between the EU and UK, and to the way they live and work. What happens next with Brexit? Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the deal will ""give certainty to business, travellers, and all investors in our country"". European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen described the agreement as ""fair"" and ""balanced"", saying it was now ""time to turn the page and look to the future"". The European Parliament needs to ratify the deal, which will define the future relationship for decades, but it is unlikely to do so until the new year. This video can not be played Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey: ""This look a very bad deal"" Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer - who campaigned against Brexit - said the deal did not provide adequate protections for jobs, manufacturing, financial services or workplace rights and was ""not the deal the government promised"". But with no time left to renegotiate, the only choice was between ""this deal or no deal,"" he added. Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey, who also campaigned against Brexit, told BBC One's Breakfast the post-Brexit trade deal meant more red tape ""we all feared"", ""far more bureaucracy"" and was a ""defeat for those who wanted frictionless trade"". He said the deal was ""bad for business"", ""less safe"" for families and it was therefore ""insupportable"". Conservative MP and former cabinet minister Theresa Villiers, who voted for Brexit, told BBC Breakfast that ""many prime ministers"" had returned from negotiations Brussels with deals that appear to ""do the right thing and then closer scrutiny demonstrates that there are not as good as first billed"". ""I hope that we have finally seen the pattern broken and I hope that this is a deal that I can support, but it is important that we scrutinise that detail carefully and take some expert advice on it."" She said Tory colleague Bill Cash, of the European Research Group of Brexit-supporting Conservative MPs, had reconvened a group of lawyers - who had been highly critical of previous Prime Minister Theresa May's withdrawal agreement with the EU - to analyse the deal.

"Ten people have been given antibodies as a form of emergency protection after being exposed to coronavirus, in the first trial of its kind. The experimental jab is being offered to people who have been in close contact with a confirmed Covid-19 case within the past eight days. If it proves effective, it could protect vulnerable people who have not yet been, or cannot be, vaccinated. And it could help to contain outbreaks. The trial, run at University College London Hospitals (UCLH) NHS Trust, is looking at whether an injection of two different antibodies could prevent someone who has been exposed to Covid from developing the disease - or at least from becoming very ill. Vaccines take weeks to offer full protection, meaning it's too late for them to be given once someone already has the virus brewing in their system. But this monoclonal antibody treatment, developed by the drugs company AstraZeneca, should work to neutralise the virus immediately. And it gives ongoing protection for up to a year. It could mean healthcare workers, hospital patients and care home residents could be given the treatment if they have been exposed to a known Covid case. It could be offered to people with health vulnerabilities by their GPs. And it could be used to prevent one or two cases turning into an outbreak in settings like student accommodation. SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? SUPPORT BUBBLES:What are they and who can be in yours? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? TESTING:How do I get a virus test? The team, lead by UCLH virologist Dr Catherine Houlihan, wants to recruit 1,000 volunteers. They are targeting recruitment at areas where people are likely to have been exposed including hospitals and student accommodation. People wanting to take part will have to show their close contact has tested positive. The jab works by ""donating"" antibodies, Dr Houlihan said - ""it skips out that stage of your body doing the work"" to make them. ""We know that this antibody combination can neutralise the virus, so we hope to find that giving this treatment via injection can lead to immediate protection against the development of Covid-19 in people who have been exposed - when it would be too late to offer a vaccine."" She explained this technique was already used post-exposure for other viruses like rabies, and chickenpox during pregnancy. Another trial already under way at UCLH is looking at whether the same antibody treatment could be used before someone is exposed coronavirus, to prevent them ever catching it. This could be particularly useful for people who have immune deficiencies or are going through immune-suppressing treatment like chemotherapy. Infectious diseases consultant Dr Nicky Longley, who is running the pre-exposure trial, said it was being trialled on people with conditions like cancer and HIV which ""may affect the ability of their immune system to respond to a vaccine. This video can not be played Can you become immune to coronavirus? ""We want to reassure anyone for whom a vaccine may not work that we can offer an alternative which is just as protective."" It might also be useful to protect vulnerable people as a stopgap before they can be given a vaccine, Dr Houlihan confirmed. But she said it was not being suggested as an alternative to the vaccine. And it's also likely to cost considerably more, at hundreds of pounds a dose. Along with UCLH, the antibody treatment will be trialled at multiple sites in the US as well as in Wakefield, Manchester, Southampton and Hull. But only the London site has begun recruiting and jabbing people. The first results for both arms of the trial - using antibodies before and after exposure to Covid - are expected in the spring.

"All but essential shops have been told to close their doors for six weeks - with a review of the lockdown to take place after four weeks A six-week lockdown has begun in Northern Ireland in a bid to stop the spread of Covid-19, as the Department of Health records another 20 coronavirus-related deaths since Christmas Eve. A further 998 people have tested positive for Covid-19. Essential shops must stop trading each day by 20:00 GMT during first week of new measures. Non-essential shops have been forced to close. Close-contact services, such as hair salons, are also to shut, pubs, cafes and restaurants are restricted to takeaway and delivery services. Executive ministers have said they will review the lockdown after four weeks. Thenew rules include,external: Closure of all non-essential retail, including garden centres and homeware shops Click-and-collect retail services will not be permitted Closure of close contact services such as hair and beauty salons Hospitality businesses will only be allowed to offer takeaway and delivery Closure of the leisure and entertainment sector Off-licences will have to close by 20:00 Hotels will be allowed to remain open until 28 December to ""accommodate the Christmas situation"" Businesses permitted to open have to limit numbers on their premises at any one time and there is to be an expanded use of Covid marshals in the retail sector. Essential shops must stop trading each day by 20:00 GMT during the first week of new measures Tighter restrictions are in place for a week from 26 December, as the executive urges people to abide by its ""stay at home"" rules. No gatherings - indoor or outdoor - are permitted between 20:00 and 06:00 each day. NI Covid-19 restrictions: Your questions answered How do NI's new lockdown restrictions affect you? This means people are not allowed to meet others in private gardens or indoors in any setting between these times, except for emergencies or the provision of health or care services. Outdoor exercise is permitted only with members of your own household. It was much quieter than usual in Belfast city centre on Saturday No sporting activity is allowed at all during the first week of lockdown, but elite sport will be allowed to resume - without spectators - from 2 January. Health Minister Robin Swann said the stay-at-home message during this week would be made ""legally enforceable"". Police would be given ""additional"" enforcement powers to ensure people are only leaving their homes for essential reasons, he added. Earlier this week, the executivepublished guidance which states,externalthat anyone travelling into Northern Ireland who plans to stay for at least 24 hours must self-isolate for 10 days. But people who routinely cross the border for essential purposes will not be subject to restrictions. It has also defined further what it constitutes as ""essential travel"", including for work and health reasons. Home for Christmas: travellers arriving at Belfast International Airport The Republic of Irelandhas imposed a temporary travel ban on Great Britain, but the Irish government has said it will not introduce controls on the border with Northern Ireland. There will be an increased Garda (Irish police) presence on Irish roads but road blocks will not be placed on the border to prevent travel between NI and the Republic. Christmas bubbles are still allowed, but the executive is urging people to form them only if ""absolutely necessary"". It agreed thatthey should be limited to one day,external, but there is flexibility on which day between 23 and 27 December people can come together, to accommodate those working on Christmas Day. The four UK nationspreviously agreed to allow some contact over Christmas, allowing up to three households to join together during the five-day window. However, those rules were later severely reduced in Great Britain as well, due to concerns aboutthe infectious new variant of coronavirus. This does not affectsupport bubbles already formed by some households,externalearlier this year, which can continue to apply. Some of the measures are only guidance and there is no penalty for breaking guidance, but people in Northern Ireland caught breaching coronavirus regulations can face a minimum fine of Â£200. There are also three other offences: Not closing a business as required Breaching closing times Not implementing social distancing Breaches of those laws can incur a fixed penalty notice of Â£1,000 or up to Â£10,000 on conviction. Health Minister Robin Swann has called for the stay-at-home guidance to be given legal force, in order to ensure people comply. It is not clear whether the lockdown rules could be extended after the six weeks, but the executive says it will respond in line with any developments regarding pressures on the health service. Meanwhile the Department of Health in the Republic of Ireland reported six more coronavirus-related deaths on Saturday, bringing its death toll to 2,200. A further 1,296 new Covid-19 cases were also recorded, taking the Republic's total number of confirmed cases to 85,394. What can I do as NI's Covid restrictions ease?

"James Rebanks the farmer and writer has long had a devoted following on social media for the pictures he posts of his land and animals in the Lake District fells, but the photographs have taken on an extra significance for some in this year of coronavirus. Here he explains how the pandemic has affected him. Some days I forget about lockdown. Or at least for a few hours. The valley has a cloud inversion this morning, it looks as though someone has used one of those disco dance-floor smoke machines until half of it has filled up. From our farmstead we look down on that sea of cloud, bathed in righteous sunshine, beneath a perfect blue sky. In the last few months we have felt very lucky indeed. We live far from the crowds of cities, and well away from the most touristy places in the Lake District. It is easy to think we aren't connected to the world, and we are incredibly lucky to have lots of outdoor space, so our lives can in many ways go on as normal. But of course we can't escape reality and we are connected to everyone else. Lockdown stopped our kids going to school for months, stopped visits to the farm, and made livestock sales volatile. When the sun shone for weeks in April and May we were almost in drought conditions, and the whole family was as brown as leather. We were lambing when the virus took off and my children were delighted to escape school and work with us in the fields. Those months of freedom seem to have changed our children, I wonder whether they liked it a little too much to ever settle at school again. I was like that, so it is hard to tell them off; they are all healthy, hard-working and smart so I think they will be OK. We were rubbish at home schooling, but we soon came to the conclusion that modern pushy parenting is daft anyway. The kids found their own interests and learned from doing all sorts of things without needing us very much at all. I have barely been in a town or city since March, and I haven't missed it. My contact with other people is very limited. If I get Covid and am poorly, I imagine the rest of the family and my friends would cover for me; this is an amazing community and we have each other's backs. I share my farming life with tens of thousands of other people through social media and my books. Though, in truth, I tend to forget about that most of the time and just write about the simple things we do, and the nature and beauty of this Lake District valley. But over the last few months I have been more aware that other people get something they need from this. The photos we share seem to give them the nature and rural life that they crave. I get messages from people all around the world every day saying that they need these glimpses of something else. It is kind of strange that someone in Taiwan or Manhattan might be living vicariously through my images. Winter is the toughest time on the farm. From the fell behind our house you can see all the way to Scotland, and we are at 1100ft above sea level, so it can be tough. The cold dry weather, and even periods of snow, are OK. But the long weeks of dark, cold and wet days are a struggle. I have a slight sense of dread at the start of every winter. But it isn't always bad. Yesterday I took my three-year-old son to the beck that runs down the valley bottom, for what he calls a ""nature walk"". Two ravens honked overhead, passing east, and a skein of geese cackled and left a contrail of child-like noise in the cold blue sky. I have felt a little guilty that so many people are less fortunate than us during the pandemic. I can't imagine the hardship of being locked down in grey urban spaces. I don't begrudge anyone else their freedom to roam or get out into the open spaces - we all need places to breathe fresh air, and feel free to wander and reconnect with the elemental things that matter. But we are also glad when tourists go home again in the winter, and we get the valley back to ourselves, with quiet roads and empty fellsides. And for all my farmer grumbling, I wouldn't leave and be anywhere else. I love this place. James Rebanks has recently published a calendar of his photographs.

"A French health worker holds a test tube after administering a nasal swab (file image) France has confirmed the first case in the country of the more contagious coronavirus variant recently identified in the UK. The French health ministry said the person was a French citizen in the central town of Tours who had arrived from London on 19 December. The ministry said he was asymptomatic, and currently self-isolating at home. The appearance of the new coronavirus variant in England triggered travel curbs with dozens of countries. US imposes Covid tests on UK airline passengers UK has two cases of variant linked to South Africa Fresh air: The forgotten coronavirus weapon France closed its border but ended its ban on Wednesday, providing people tested negative before travelling. Thousands of lorry drivers spent Christmas Day in their cabs in Kent waiting to cross the English Channel. It was confirmed after the man was tested in hospital on 21 December, the health ministry said. The infected person, a French national living in the UK, was feeling all right, it added without providing further details. Other countries have also reported cases of the new variant: on Friday, Japan confirmed five infections in passengers who had all arrived from the UK, while cases in Denmark, Australia and the Netherlands were reported earlier. Last week, France lifted its national lockdown, but the government said the infection rate had not fallen sufficiently for a further easing. This means theatres and cinemas remain shut as do bars and restaurants. A nationwide curfew is also effective from 20:00 to 06:00. The curfew was lifted for Christmas Eve - but will remain for New Year's Eve. France has reported more than 2.5 million confirmed Covid infections since the start of the outbreak, with more than 62,000 deaths - the seventh highest total deaths in the world. The country's first batch of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccinations meanwhile were delivered from Belgium to the health system's central pharmacy just outside Paris on Saturday, AFP news agency reports. The first shots are due to be administered to patients at two facilities for the elderly - in Sevran and Dijon - on Sunday. The new variant first detected in England in September is blamed for sharp rises in levels of positive tests in recent weeks in London, the east of England and the South East. This video can not be played Covid symptoms: What are they and how long should I self-isolate for? About two-thirds of people testing positive in these areas could have the new variant - but this is only an estimate, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) says. Three things are coming together that mean the new variant is attracting attention: It is rapidly replacing other versions of the virus It has mutations that affect part of the virus likely to be important Some of those mutations have already been shown in the lab to increase the ability of the virus to infect cells All of these come together to build a case for a virus that can spread more easily, says the BBC's health and science correspondent, James Gallagher. However, there is no evidence that the new variant is more dangerous, and the leading vaccines developed in recent months should still work, experts say. New coronavirus variant: What do we know? More than 40 countries banned all UK arrivals earlier this month. Flights from the UK were suspended to territories across the world including Spain, India and Hong Kong.

"The annual Boxing Day dip in Whitby is one of the events cancelled due to the virus Scores of bracing sea swims due to take place around England over the festive period have been cancelled due to safety fears over the Covid pandemic. ""Dippers"" would usually brave the chilly waters dressed as Father Christmas, elves, or even Christmas puddings to raise money for charity. Organisers have asked people to take part in virtual challenges instead. Despite the official cancellations, a handful of hardy swimmers did still take the plunge in Clevedon, Somerset. Boxing Day and New Year's Day dips at Clevedon Marine Lake were cancelled but some still braved the lake's icy waters on Saturday. Outdoor swimming coach Rowan Clarke told BBC Breakfast that demand has soared over recent months. Swimmers still took to the waters at Clevedon Marine Lake on Boxing Day despite the organised swim being cancelled She said: ""It's one of those things that people who have done it for a long time make it look really easy. ""I think that can lull you into a false sense of security that it's not an extreme sport, which of course it is. ""The best thing to do is start swimming in the summer and then gradually work your way up - or I should say down - to these temperatures."" The Ice Warriors, from Hull, took the plunge earlier in December after Covid put paid to the annual New Year's Day event in Hornsea, East Yorkshire. Andy Butler, from the group, said: ""We normally have a Christmas party, and attend the New Year's Day dip, but obviously we can't this year. ""So, we thought we would combine the two and have a charity swim."" Mr Butler said he had never known the event, organised by Hornsea Inshore Rescue, to be cancelled before - ""even when the weather was horrible"". He said it would normally attract a large crowd and raise about Â£5,000 to help with the costs of running the lifeboat service. ""We raised about Â£600,"" he said. ""It's a big drop but better than nothing."" Hornsea Inshore Rescue said fundraising efforts this year had ""completely dried up"". Spokeswoman Sue Hickson-Marsay said: ""We need Â£35,000 to Â£40,000 a year to function and we've had less than Â£10,000 this year."" Last year's Whitby event attracted about 200 people, many taking the plunge in fancy dress Others, including the Whitby District Lions Club, which organises the resort's annual Boxing Day dip, have also been hit. Brian Harrison, from the charity, said: ""Last year, we had a record-breaking response with over 200 dippers taking part and at least 1,000 spectators supporting the event. ""As a result, the club raised over Â£14,000 for various local and national charities."" The charity is instead hosting a virtual ice bucket-style challenge in a bid to raise cash. Hundreds of people would normally take part in Redcar's annual Boxing Day dip The annual dip in Redcar, on the North Sea coast, is another long-standing event to be cancelled this year. The 2019 event attracted about 360 swimmers and raised in the region of Â£40,000, the local Rotary Club said. It too is asking people to take part in ""a virtual dip"" at home. Norfolk's annual Boxing Day dip, which claims to be one of the biggest in England, has been cancelled for the first time in its history. The event in Cromer, organised by North Norfolk Beach Runners, has raised more than Â£75,000 since it started ""as a bit of a dare"" in 1985. Organisers of the Cromer Boxing Day event said it would have been impossible to enforce social distancing rules Clive Hedges, from the group, said: ""We just felt that under the circumstances it was best to cancel it and focus on a fantastic event next year. ""It's hugely disappointing but there really was no option. ""Maybe we could've kept the dippers safe in a Covid-secure environment, but it is ultimately the crowds we could not keep safe and they're the ones that provide the wonderful donations to charity."" While hopeful ""normality will resume again for next year"", Mr Bridges said there were some who would argue taking a dip in freezing cold waters on Boxing Day ""just isn't normal"" anyway. Cornwall's official Boxing Day swim gatherings have also been cancelled because of Covid restrictions. The countywent from tier one to tougher tier two on Boxing Day. Mark Richards, of Charlestown Rowing Club, said they usually have between 100 and 600 swimmers in the water. ""But the problem is with track and trace and social distancing with the 600 to 1,000 people who turn up to watch, which we just cannot do.""

Bedford Mayor Dave Hodgson said water levels peaked in Bedford at about 02:00 GMT The council said people who had been contacted and asked to evacuate were ""permitted to go to other people's homes"". Bedfordshire is currently under ""tier four - stay at home"" Covid restrictions, which bans household mixing. Bedfordshire Police said the flooding situation ""over-rides the current Covid-19 regulations"". Jan Schofield said neighbourhood WhatsApp groups helped with the community response Jan Schofield, who lives beside the river on The Embankment, said she had been prepared to evacuate if needed. ""The neighbours were superb,"" she said. ""They were digging the ditch over the road and filling sandbags. ""Because of WhatsApp groups that were set-up for Covid, it was really quick to get everyone together and act. ""It was a concern to see the rising water as it got darker. I'm less concerned now it's daylight."" The Carvell family (left) and Wood family live close to the river in Bedford Reece Wood, who also lives nearby with his family, said: ""It was not the Christmas anyone was expecting, but it was great that everyone pulled together.""

"George Blake told the BBC he had betrayed more than 500 Western agents to the Soviet Union George Blake, the former MI6 officer and one of the Cold War's most infamous double agents, has died aged 98, Russian media has reported. Over nine years, the Soviet spy handed over information that led to the betrayal of at least 40 MI6 agents in Eastern Europe. He was jailed in London in 1960, but escaped in 1966 and fled to Russia. The Russian Foreign Intelligence Service said Blake ""had a genuine love for our country"". His death, reported by Russia's state-owned news agency RIA Novosti, was confirmed by Sergei Ivanov, the head of the press bureau of the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR). Russian president Vladimir Putin described him as an ""outstanding professional of special courage and life endurance"". ""Throughout the years of his hard and strenuous efforts he made a truly invaluable contribution to ensuring the strategic parity and the preservation of peace on the planet,"" he said in a message of condolence. ""Our hearts will always cherish the warm memory of this legendary man."" Obituary: George Blake Blake was born George Behar on 11 November 1922 in the Dutch city of Rotterdam. His father was a Spanish Jew who had fought with the British army during World War One and acquired British citizenship. Blake himself worked for the Dutch resistance during World War Two, before fleeing to British-controlled Gibraltar. He was later, due to his background, asked to join the intelligence service. Blake in 1953 In an interview with the BBC in 1990, Blake said he estimated that he betrayed more than 500 Western agents but he denied suggestions that 42 of them had lost their lives as a result of his actions. His downfall came when a Polish secret service officer, Michael Goleniewski, defected to the West, bringing his mistress and details of a Soviet mole in British intelligence. Blake was recalled to London and arrested. At a subsequent trial he pleaded guilty to five counts of passing information to the Soviet Union. George Blake did enormous damage to British intelligence operations during the Cold War, betraying agents and secret operations and showing that the KGB could run agents within the heart of the British state. His escape from prison added to the embarrassment. The reasons behind Blake's actions sometimes seemed mysterious, particularly his initial recruitment. When I contacted him a decade ago, he told me: ""It is no longer of particular importance to me whether my motivations are generally understood or not."" Part of the problem for him was that he had chosen communism but lived to see its collapse and the end of the Soviet Union, living out his days in Russia, where he was still seen as a hero by the successors to the KGB. In 1995, Blake's escape from HMP Wormwood Scrubs became the focus of the play Cell Mates, starring Stephen Fry and Rik Mayall. And in 2015, the BBC documentary Masterspy of Moscow followed what it called ""the strange life"" of an ""enigmatic traitor"".

"James Rebanks the farmer and writer has long had a devoted following on social media for the pictures he posts of his land and animals in the Lake District fells, but the photographs have taken on an extra significance for some in this year of coronavirus. Here he explains how the pandemic has affected him. Some days I forget about lockdown. Or at least for a few hours. The valley has a cloud inversion this morning, it looks as though someone has used one of those disco dance-floor smoke machines until half of it has filled up. From our farmstead we look down on that sea of cloud, bathed in righteous sunshine, beneath a perfect blue sky. In the last few months we have felt very lucky indeed. We live far from the crowds of cities, and well away from the most touristy places in the Lake District. It is easy to think we aren't connected to the world, and we are incredibly lucky to have lots of outdoor space, so our lives can in many ways go on as normal. But of course we can't escape reality and we are connected to everyone else. Lockdown stopped our kids going to school for months, stopped visits to the farm, and made livestock sales volatile. When the sun shone for weeks in April and May we were almost in drought conditions, and the whole family was as brown as leather. We were lambing when the virus took off and my children were delighted to escape school and work with us in the fields. Those months of freedom seem to have changed our children, I wonder whether they liked it a little too much to ever settle at school again. I was like that, so it is hard to tell them off; they are all healthy, hard-working and smart so I think they will be OK. We were rubbish at home schooling, but we soon came to the conclusion that modern pushy parenting is daft anyway. The kids found their own interests and learned from doing all sorts of things without needing us very much at all. I have barely been in a town or city since March, and I haven't missed it. My contact with other people is very limited. If I get Covid and am poorly, I imagine the rest of the family and my friends would cover for me; this is an amazing community and we have each other's backs. I share my farming life with tens of thousands of other people through social media and my books. Though, in truth, I tend to forget about that most of the time and just write about the simple things we do, and the nature and beauty of this Lake District valley. But over the last few months I have been more aware that other people get something they need from this. The photos we share seem to give them the nature and rural life that they crave. I get messages from people all around the world every day saying that they need these glimpses of something else. It is kind of strange that someone in Taiwan or Manhattan might be living vicariously through my images. Winter is the toughest time on the farm. From the fell behind our house you can see all the way to Scotland, and we are at 1100ft above sea level, so it can be tough. The cold dry weather, and even periods of snow, are OK. But the long weeks of dark, cold and wet days are a struggle. I have a slight sense of dread at the start of every winter. But it isn't always bad. Yesterday I took my three-year-old son to the beck that runs down the valley bottom, for what he calls a ""nature walk"". Two ravens honked overhead, passing east, and a skein of geese cackled and left a contrail of child-like noise in the cold blue sky. I have felt a little guilty that so many people are less fortunate than us during the pandemic. I can't imagine the hardship of being locked down in grey urban spaces. I don't begrudge anyone else their freedom to roam or get out into the open spaces - we all need places to breathe fresh air, and feel free to wander and reconnect with the elemental things that matter. But we are also glad when tourists go home again in the winter, and we get the valley back to ourselves, with quiet roads and empty fellsides. And for all my farmer grumbling, I wouldn't leave and be anywhere else. I love this place. James Rebanks has recently published a calendar of his photographs.

"Parents say an adult would not be left in pain the way they claim their babies have been Parents of babies suffering from acid reflux say they do not feel they are taken seriously when trying to seek help. About 40% of babies experiencereflux,external, with 90% growing out of the condition by the age of one and it does not usually cause discomfort. However, some can experience pain, discomfort and trouble gaining weight. ""She cried 18 hours a day,"" Sophie Edwards said of her baby Luna, who was born in April during lockdown. ""It not only was a traumatic birth but what followed has been just as traumatic,"" Sophie, from Wrexham, said. Is it safe for your baby to sleep with you? Mums 'opting for C-section' due to Covid rules 'How lockdown stopped me from breastfeeding' Praise for soldiers who helped deliver babies Sophie described Luna as an ""angry, sad and screaming little baby"" until she was four months old when doctors prescribed heart burn medication and a special formula milk. ""One midwife told me I just had an 'irritable baby' and that I was 'tired'. Another health visitor over the telephone told us to try her back on normal formula and plough on through."" Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board said it was working to follow the guidelines during the pandemic, and to support patients and families as much as it could. Alison Cowell, assistant area director for children's services, said: ""As a result of the guidance, all patients are risk-assessed and any child or family where a face-to-face appointment is deemed essential, can receive one. ""If a parent was concerned about their child's feeding and if not resolved over time through telephone advice and the concerns persist, a face-to face-appointment would be made and the baby weighed."" Sophie is not alone in her experience, with parents on a Facebook support group saying they feel ""ignored"" when trying to get help. ""My doctor prescribed sleeping tablets and anti-depressants for me - because my baby didn't sleep,"" one mother said, with another adding: ""The lack of support, and general understanding by doctors, including paediatricians, is shocking."" Another parent said: ""I was terrified he was going to die if I wasn't watching him. At six months, he vomited blood and we took him to A&E. His throat was compared to an alcoholic's. It was so raw the acid had literally burned it and caused a blood vessel to break."" Dr Eilir Hughes, a GP in Gwynedd, said good communication between a patient and medical professional was imperative, and studies have shown parents who report excessive crying do often score higher on depression scores so it is important they were listened to. Fiona George Williams says she relied on Google and support groups to find ways to help Violet Fiona George Williams, 33, from Swansea, said her baby Violet was ""gagging, choking and crying all the time and was always congested"". Violet gained weight but slowly, and was prescribed a different milk, in case she was suffering from a cow's milk allergy, and heart burn medication. ""At her last injections, she had dropped weight drastically so they admitted us to paediatrics... when he checked her weight it seemed she was never losing weight they had just plotted her wrong on chart,"" Fiona said. She added while she felt medical professionals had taken her seriously, she took it upon herself to research via Google and support groups what could have been causing Violet's problems. ""I just knew something wasn't right. I was constantly watching and taking in everything Violet was doing and when. ""I went to the doctors saying 'I think it's this or that', gave all my reasons and they went with it. ""Mums know when there is something just not right. The amount of times I've heard 'it's all trial and error' - who wants any errors regarding a baby?"" Geraint Morris, consultant neonatologist and service lead at Swansea Bay health board, said: ""We are very sorry to hear of Ms Williams' concerns. ""Although we cannot comment on individual cases without consent, we would be happy to discuss those concerns with her directly. ""Generally speaking, gastro-oesophageal reflux is a common condition in babies and can be very troublesome to them and challenging for their parents. ""While treatment options are limited, it is generally a condition that improves with age - though severe cases may need more specialist management."" Rachel Davies, 28, said she'd had a ""nightmare for nine months"" - with one paediatrician suggesting her baby was crying all the time because she was ""bored"". Rachel Davies said her daughter was in pain for nine months but one doctor suggested she may just be ""bored"" ""I wasn't taken seriously,"" she said. Ms Davies' daughter had silent reflux - where milk is brought up but swallowed back down again, with the stomach acid causing irritation in the throat. ""She was never sick much, just screamed every second of the day and night. ""I must have gone to the doctors at least once a week as she was in constant pain, nothing I was doing was working. ""The paediatric doctor told me she was bored at five months, but realised after half-an-hour of screaming she wasn't bored."" Ms Davies, from Pontypridd, said three different medications were tried, along with different formula milks and baby massage. ""Lockdown then happened and I begged to see the doctor as she was in pain all the time. She told me as it was lockdown she couldn't have her stay in the hospital to do some tests so we were basically sent home with nothing and just told put up with it. ""I had a two-year-old to look after too while my boyfriend worked full-time. ""It was pure hell. Eventually after nine months of constant screaming she settled a lot."" Ms Davies believes reflux also affected her daughter's development, as she would begin to crawl when the condition settled and stop again when it flared. ""How there isn't more help for reflux babies, I do not know,"" she said. ""They wouldn't let an adult be in that much pain, so why such a young baby?"" Cwm Taf Morgannwg health board said its clinicians followed national guidance on deciding a course of treatment or management of acid reflux in babies. ""While we cannot comment on individual cases, we understand that the symptoms of acid reflux can be distressing to babies and parents and sympathise with them."" A spokeswoman said Covid-19 had an impact on its ability to provide care and treatment in the usual ways, but its teams continued to work hard to support families as much as possible and the health board apologised to anyone who felt they had not been supported. Becky Palmer, who graduated from Aberystwyth Law School, was inspired by her own experiences with baby reflux to give up her job as a solicitor and start a reflux and colic support group for parents, Colic SOS. Becky Palmer gave up her job as a solicitor to train in methods to help reflux babies such as massage and baby yoga ""I had my little boy and he was not a happy baby, it was not the introduction to motherhood I expected,"" she said. Ms Palmer said the help new parents were offered could be ""very varying"". ""Some health visitors are very much on board with it and will push GPs to help, but then you hear stories of parents really having to fight to be heard."" Ms Palmer said things had worsened during lockdown with a lack of face-to-face appointments. Dr Eilir Hughes said it was vital some appointments, such as those for weighing babies, should continue - and that parents should have access to the help they needed so they did not turn to the internet for medical advice which ""fuels anxiety and uncertainty further"". He said doctors needed to take a good history to ensure a reflux diagnosis was correct, and medications needed to be given time to work - which could take several weeks. ""Excessive crying is a condition in its own right, and regurgitation which is not alarming is something all children do,"" Dr Hughes said. ""But if parents feel a condition is not taken seriously, it's down to the way that the professional addresses those concerns and communication is key."" Dr Hughes said healthcare professionals often had to rely entirely on a parent's account of the situation, as a baby may be asleep in a pram for the duration of an appointment, which could be difficult. Why touching and talking is so important for new-born babies Activities for newborns Mothers 'unlikely to pass on Covid-19 to newborns' Help! We're Having a Baby ""This is why we encourage parents to take videos of what is happening, show us, so a parent can see their concerns are addressed. ""Parents shouldn't be brushed away and told 'this is nothing'. ""We have to assess what's to be expected from an infant, or if something justifies the worry."" Dr Hughes said different approaches were tried first, such as feeding half as much twice as often and changing feeding positions, with medicating an infant a last resort. There are also milk thickeners, and infant heart burn medication, to be tried before medication containing active ingredients such as omeprazole and ranitidine. While some parents told BBC News they interpreted this approach as children being left in pain, Dr Hughes said each method or prescription can take several weeks before the benefit is seen. ""It's not going to be a quick fix and there's a lot of anxiety there for parents as a result. They won't necessarily work within days. ""One mantra I try to stick to is 'always listen to the parent'. If their concerns aren't addressed, if the clinician doesn't appreciate why they're worried about a given problem or symptom, then finding an effective treatment is often very challenging.""

"This video can not be played Is it freezing or balmy? Whatever, it's a good hangover cure, apparently While many of us are snuggled up in our pyjamas, every year thousands of swimmers strip off and run into the sea for an icy dip to celebrate Christmas and welcome in the new year. For decades, beaches across Wales have been filled with people whooping and shivering as they race into the sea in swimming costumes and Santa hats. With the coronavirus pandemic leading to the festive and new year annual dips being cancelled, charities have faced losing thousands of pounds in sponsorship money. While many of us would welcome an excuse not to plunge into chilly water, swimmers had been determined to not let coronavirus get in the way of what has become a really jolly tradition, even if they can no longer do it on the big day. The history of Wales' festive dips Swansea man's cold sea challenge 'to get out of bed' The swims across Wales, including at Barry Island, raise thousands for charities Last year, almost 400 swimmers raced into the sea to blow off the Christmas turkey and fizz on the seafront in Rhyl as part of the annual Boxing Day swim. After a hectic year, the RNLI crew at the popular Denbighshire seaside resort would normally raise hundreds of pounds during the icy challenge, but with the pandemic they have had to think outside of the box. In a bid to raise cash, after attending about 80 calls in the summer months alone as people holidayed closer to home, the Rhyl crew now want people to carry on the tradition, but in true lockdown style. ""The idea is for people to do it at home. Get a family member to chuck a bucket of water over you, have a dip in the hot tub or paddling pool or bath,"" said mechanic Callum Robinson. ""But if you are going to do a cold one, please make sure other people are on hand to look after you, we don't want people getting cold water shock."" Mr Robinson, who is on call over Christmas, urged people to stay at home and follow government guidance, and not put their lives at risk by heading to the sea. Rhian Thomas celebrated turning 50 with a chilly dip in Porthcawl Even before lockdown was announced, organisers of Porthcawl's Christmas Day swim realised there was no way it could go ahead. In its 55th year in 2019, the event saw more than 1,300 swimmers and 5,000 spectators head to the beach, adding up to a real social-distancing headache. But as a key part of Christmas for so many in the seaside community and the event raising more than Â£17,000 for charity, organisers realised it had to go ahead in some form. ""It's all I've ever known on Christmas morning, we always got up, opened a few presents, put some fancy dress on and went a sang carols at an old people's home, before heading to the beach and watching people run into the sea,"" organiser Lucy Jones said. ""I thought that was normal, I didn't realise other people don't do that. ""My kids always do it now and I think it's the same for a lot of families, so it's something that's become a bit of a routine for people and they've got to think about how to fill that gap on Christmas Day."" Joy and Matthew as the Jolly Sailor Team taking part in their festive dip Carole Anne Lyle got festive to take part in the event before lockdown hit But now, with people being told not to go into the sea or lakes, they are being encouraged to get soaked at home, using hoses, water pistols and hot tubs, before donating online. Due to the success of the virtual event, Ms Jones said they were thinking of having an online challenge every year, to share the joy of Porthcawl's festivity all over the world. ""We've had people who used to live here, who now live on the other side of the world and can't come home to visit and do the swim, but this year they've been able to do it in the nice warm sea, and taken part,"" she said. This video can not be played What should you do if you fall into cold water - a BBC Wales reporter finds out If you are looking to head out for a walk, bike ride or a run over the holidays you might be wondering what the rules are. Under thelevel four lockdownpeople should stay home, but leaving your house for exercise is allowed. There is no limit to how many times, how long you can exercise for, or how far you can go, but you should exercise alone, or only with your household or support bubble, and should not travel to exercise. The Welsh Government is also urging people not to go into the sea or lakes, meaning wild swimming is effectively off the cards, due to concerns about safety.

"Harsher Covid restrictions now apply to millions more people, as rule changes come into force across the UK. Around six million people in east and south-east England have gone into tier four, England's highest Covid level - which includes a ""stay at home"" order. Lockdowns have also started in Scotland and Northern Ireland, and measures have been reimposed in Wales after being eased for Christmas. It comes after official UK coronavirus deathspassed 70,000 on Christmas Day. The toughest measures - which mean the closure of all non-essential shops, as well as hairdressers, swimming pools and gyms - now apply to around 24 million people in England, more than 40% of the population. Meanwhile, work has continued in Kent to clear the backlog of lorries formed after France closed the border to the UK due to the discovery of a fast-spreading variant of coronavirus. The border has reopened but drivers must provide a negative Covid test before making the crossing, with the Department for Transport warning there were""still long queues"" on Saturday evening,external. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said more than 15,000 tests had now been carried out on lorry drivers, with 36 positive results. Prof Devi Sridhar, chairwoman of global public health at the University of Edinburgh, told the BBC she believed all of England was likely to soon be in tier four. ""I think that's where it's heading and it's better to be honest with people so they can plan the next few weeks to understand what might be coming,"" she said, adding: ""To really keep a handle on these numbers, you need to move early.""

The whole of Sussex, Oxfordshire, Suffolk, Norfolk and Cambridgeshire, as well Essex, Waverley in Surrey, and all of Hampshire with the exception of the New Forest, are now in tier four. Bristol, Gloucestershire, Somerset, Swindon, the Isle of Wight, the New Forest and Northamptonshire, as well as Cheshire and Warrington, have all moved up to tier three. Meanwhile, Cornwall and Herefordshire have moved from tier one to tier two. Tier four restrictions mean shops in many town and city centres have been closed for the first time in decades on Boxing Day, when there are usually sales. Even some retailers deemed ""essential"" - such as Asda - have opted not to open. In Scotland - which operates under a different tier system - level four lockdown measures have come into force across the mainland for three weeks. Orkney, Shetland, the Western Isles and other island communities are in level three. And in Northern Ireland, a six-week lockdown has begun. The first week, until 2 January, has stricter restrictions, including essential shops closing at 20:00 GMT and no sport. For the first week, people are also banned from meeting indoors or outdoors between 20:00 and 06:00. NI police have legally-enforceable powers to tell anyone out during those hours to return home, unless they have a ""reasonable excuse"", such as being a key worker or having caring responsibilities.

Covid: Five things we still need to keep an eye on Are we ready for last Covid rule to be ditched? End of Covid regulations: What if I'm still worried? Scotland's legal restrictions on face coverings have come to an end - but the Scottish government says itstrongly recommends wearing a mask,externalin indoor public spaces and on public transport. People with symptoms are no longer being asked to take a PCR test - they're now advised to stay at home while they're unwell. Testing for the general population has ended. The Scottish government has also confirmedit will ""switch off"" the domestic part of its vaccine passport scheme. What is the Covid advice in Scotland? Masks are no longer required in shops or on public transport - although they are recommended - but they remain compulsory in health and social care settings. The legal requirement for people to self-isolate if they have Covid has also ended - although doing so is strongly advised. Wales will maintain free lateral flow tests (LFTs)until the end of July,external. What are the latest Covid rules for Wales? In England, the government suggests wearing a mask in ""crowded and enclosed spaces where you may come into contact with other people you do not normally meet"". Patients areno longer required to wear masks,externalin NHS hospitals, GP surgeries and emergency departments, unless they have suspected or confirmed Covid infection.

"The Queen will not be making her annual trip to Sandringham this Christmas For the past 32 years the Queen and other members of the Royal Family have spent Christmas at her estate in Sandringham, Norfolk. But this year, because of the coronavirus, the Queen has chosen instead tocelebrate ""quietly""at Windsor Palace. What will this mean for the Christmas regulars who gather at Sandringham? This snap of the Royals in 2017 provided Karen Anvil with an income to carry out home renovations and help her daughter Karen Anvil and her daughter Rachel are regular Christmas Day visitors to church in Sandringham. Ms Anvil shot to fame three years ago after her mobile telephone snap of the 'Fab Four' - The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Sussex - was bought by agencies and used worldwide. She describes themoney she made from it as being ""like a lottery win"". Karen Anvil, with her daughter Rachel, captured images of the Royal Family used around the world Her good fortune was repeated in 2018 when she took and sold a photo of a pregnant Meghan. ""I would have liked to have gone this year but would probably have just got pictures of them in their face masks,"" says Ms Anvil. But she admits seeing the Royal Family at Sandringham this year would have brought some much needed ""normality"" to her life. Ms Anvil works as a nursing auxiliary at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge, where her daughter is also employed. She says they might volunteer to work Christmas Day instead. Super Royalist Mary Relph has spoken regularly with the Queen over the decades Mary Relph, from Shouldham in Norfolk, is one of those Royal fans who gets her Christmas Day started by joining the throngs hoping to catch a glimpse, a wave or a chat with the Queen and members of her family. She isknown to the Queen by her first name, which, for someone who is not an aristocrat, politician or celebrity, is no mean feat. Mrs Relph has been turning out each year to greet Her Majesty on Christmas morning since 1988. ""Ooh it's one of the biggest events Norfolk ever has, isn't it?"" she says. She is disappointed by the cancellation of this year's gathering, but thinks the Queen has set an example to others by not going to Sandringham. ""I wasn't expecting them to come, not really, not after all the trouble with the [Covid-19] virus,"" says Mrs Relph. ""I think she's wise. I think we sort of knew with events she wouldn't come."" For her Sandringham visits, Mrs Relph is usually accompanied either by a friend from Dereham or with a Glaswegian friend she made one year amongst the crowd. She says she normally gets her own ""spot"" from which she can watch and speak to members of the Royal Family. ""I'm one of the chosen few, I think, because I've been going for so many years,"" she says. ""I don't have to stand and queue at the gates like I used to. It's wonderful. ""We spoke to Kate last year and we always ask her about the children and what they're doing."" Princess Beatrice and Eugenie usually spend Christmas with the Queen Peter Gray, 61, and his wife Stella, 60, live on the Sandringham estate in the hamlet of Babingley. Turning out to watch the Royals has been part of their Christmas morning routine for the past eight years. ""It just makes our Christmas,"" says Mrs Gray. ""It's a good start to the day. We're up there by 07:00 GMT, take a flask, mince pies, sometimes brandy!"" Her husband Peter is a keen photographer and loves snapping the Royal Family. He says his relatives in Australia wait for him to post his photos online. ""The rest of the family are going to be disappointed not to get my Royal photos this year,"" says Mr Gray. ""We get there and start queuing, start talking to people from all around the world. It's not just about seeing the royals, it's about the people from China, Canada, Australia and the US too. ""We stand by the same place each year to ensure a good spot, by the gate, as they come through. They don't normally talk to you heading into church but they do afterwards."" Peter Gray captured the Duchess of Cornwall at a previous service Prince Philip and Prince Andrew among the crowds at Sandringham Mrs Gray says she has been a royal fan ""forever"". ""I've spoken to Camilla, she's come up and said 'Merry Christmas'. Prince William has come up and said 'hello', too,"" she says. ""Prince Andrew has come up and been err, 'what are you all doing here? You should be at home'. He's quite abrupt! ""I don't think he understands why we're all out there in the freezing cold wanting to look round and see him, but we enjoy it."" She says things will be ""different"" this year, and a ""bit strange"". ""I suppose there are people for whom the day is their whole lives,"" she says. ""It's certainly a big part of our Christmas Day. But we're realists and it is what it is. ""Maybe next year."" Up to 5,000 people turn out to greet the Royal Family every Christmas Day at Sandringham Also wondering how he will fill his Christmas morning is hair salon owner Tom Tokelove, 31, who lives in Dersingham, Norfolk, with his husband Ashley. The couple and their three poodles have spent the past four Christmases ""freezing"" outside St Mary Magdalene Church. ""Why? It's such a magical morning,"" says Tom Tokelove. ""Everybody is happy. ""Even if you're not a massive royalist, it brings everyone together and it's just some way of keeping some sort of tradition."" The couple start the day with a glass of champagne before walking the 20 minutes to the estate. ""Last year we left at seven in the morning just to make sure we got there in the front of the queue,"" he says. ""We really, really wanted to see Kate and Wills. Kate said 'good morning' to myself as she glided by, looking very elegant with the children, too. ""And Charles waved and said 'Merry Christmas'."" Tom Tokelove caught the Royals including Prince George walking from church to Sandringham House last Christmas The Tokeloves usually only stop to watch the Royal Family head into church. But last year they stayed on and joined in with the carols as the service was broadcast to those outside. ""It will be a much different dog walk this year - obviously there'll be no Royals about to celebrate with,"" says Mr Tokelove. ""[We'll] probably drink much more champagne in the morning and have a more relaxed day.""

"All airline passengers arriving in the US from the UK are to be required to test negative for Covid-19 within 72 hours of departure amid concerns about a new coronavirus variant. From 28 December travellers will need to provide written documentation of their test result to airlines. Other countries have shut their borders to UK flights because of the variant. But its rapid spread has also led to stricter rules in the UK, including a ban on overseas trips for many Britons. And US airlines have drastically scaled back flying to the UK and Europe, after the entry of most foreign nationals was suspended at the start of the pandemic. Health officials say there is no evidence the new variant is more deadly, or would react differently to vaccines, but it is proving to be up to 70% more transmissible. New coronavirus variant: What do we know? The decision by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to require testing came afterNew York City introduced quarantine rules for international travellersin response to the variant.
