"Rupert Murdoch with sons Lachlan (l) and James (r) Sky is to stop broadcasting Fox News in the UK after low audience figures, the media firm has said. 21st Century Fox, which is owned by Rupert Murdoch, said the channel was being withdrawn as it was not commercially viable. The decision was not related to Fox's takeover bid for Sky, a source told the BBC. Culture secretary Karen Bradley has previously said she may refer the bid to competition regulators. ""[Fox] has decided to cease providing a feed of Fox News Channel in the UK,"" a company spokeswoman said. ""Fox News is focused on the US market and designed for a US audience and, accordingly, it averages only a few thousand viewers across the day in the UK. ""We have concluded that it is not in our commercial interest to continue providing Fox News in the UK,"" she added. Sky stopped broadcasting the US television network in the UK from 4pm on Tuesday. In May, a woman who alleged that she had been sexually harassed at Fox Newsasked UK media regulators to block21st Century Fox's planned purchase of Sky. The company source said complaints against Fox News in relation to the takeover bid were not the reason for the TV network being dropped. The source said that Fox News had about 2,000 average daily viewers. The costs of distributing the US network in the UK meant it was not in 21st Century Fox's commercial interests to continue, the source added. However, figures from the Broadcaster's Audience Research Board (Barb) suggest that Fox News' average UK daily viewing figures were nearly 60,000 per day this year. Back in December, 21st Century Fox offered Â£11.7bn for the 61% stake in Sky it does not already own. Critics of the merger, which gives 21st Century Fox access to Sky's 22 million customers in Europe, say Rupert Murdoch will have too much control of the UK media.

"The West Ham striker told the court he hit about 10 cars in his effort to get away West Ham striker Andy Carroll has told a court a gun-wielding motorbike rider tried to rob him of his Â£22,000 watch. The footballer, who has nine England caps, told Basildon Crown Court he was returning home from training when he was chased by two motorcyclists. He said one rider pulled alongside him at the traffic lights and demanded his watch. They followed him as he drove off, and one made gun signs at him. Jack O'Brien, 22, denies attempting to rob the 28-year-old on 2 November 2016. In a frantic 999 call played to the jury, the Premier League player said: ""There's two motorbikes, one's behind me pulling out a gun, I don't know what to do."" As beeping is heard in the background, he swears and tells the operator: ""I've hit loads of cars, I don't know what to do, he's just hit my car."" He eventually arrived at the West Ham training ground where he told the operator there were security staff there. ""I've probably just hit about 10 cars on the way here,"" he said in the call. The court heard the bikers had approached Mr Carroll at traffic lights on Romford Road in Hainault, north-east London. The player told the jury: ""I just pulled up at the traffic lights, my window was open, a bike pulled up next to me and said 'Nice watch'."" He said he replied ""thanks"" and thought he recognised the man on the motorbike. ""He had his crash helmet on with his visor up,"" he said. ""I stared at him for about 10 seconds as I thought I recognised him and thought he was going to have a conversation."" He continued: ""I went to drive away and he said 'Give me your watch'."" Mr Carroll said he was not sure if it was a joke, but when he did a U-turn, both riders turned and followed him. The footballer added: ""I was scared, I didn't know what to do.  ""I called my partner's dad, I just panicked. ""He told me to ring the police."" Prosecutor Simon Gladwell said the footballer was ""beeping at other cars and driving on the wrong side of the road to get away"". Mr Gladwell said the motorbike rider ""repeatedly pointed at him with a gun,"" or pretended to have a gun and demanded to have his client's watch. Forensic scientist Luan Lunt told the court that DNA found on a crash helmet and Ducati motorbike jacket linked to the incident matched Mr O'Brien's. The chances of that DNA originating from anyone else was ""one-in-a-billion"", she estimated. During cross examination, she said she could not give a specific time or date as to when the DNA was left on the items. Michael Edmonds, defending, said Mr O'Brien, of Navarre Gardens, Romford, east London, was not the motorbike rider. He said the defendant had used the bike, jacket and helmet for crime before, but it was not him using the motorbike on this occasion. The trial continues.

"Snapchat and Facebook take contrasting approaches to fact-checking their users' posts Snapchat has said its in-house team of journalists play a key role in helping it cover the news accurately. As an example, the social network told the BBC it had fact-checked user-generated coverage from the recent Charlottesville protests with local police before highlighting the posts. The approach contrasts with that of its rival Facebook. Facebook used to employ an editorial team to curate its trending news section, but disbanded it last year. The larger company now relies on algorithms and external services to help tackle so-called ""fake news"". Snapchat's audience is a fraction of Facebook's. The former recently reported having 173 million active daily users, while the latter said it had more than two billion monthly ones. This video can not be played It is ""much harder"" for radicalists to emerge on Snapchat than on other platforms, says vice president of content However, one research companyhas said Snapchat,externalis set to prove more popular with young adults in the US this year. Although Snapchat is best known for its self-deleting messaging service and augmented reality selfie filters, its owner, Snap, is also keen to highlight the ways it is investing in becoming a source of news. CNN has recently started streaming a daily show on the platform, and several other mainstream media outlets make content available via its Discover facility. But Nick Bell, vice-president of content at Snap, was also keen to discuss how the app had curated videos of James Alex Fields Jr - the main suspect in the killing of a woman near a white supremacist rally in Virginia - filmed by its users. Heather Heyer was killed and 19 others were injured when a car hit anti-fascism protesters in Charlottesville ""We have a news team - we have journalists who work at Snapchat, who are looking at content that comes in and are evaluating it, are determining whether it is accurate, whether it is relevant and how we can add additional context,"" Mr Bell, from Alnwick, Northumberland, told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme. ""So, if you look at some of the events in Chartlottesville, for example, in recent weeks, we actually received Snaps from members of our community of the driver being arrested. ""Before we published these Snaps, we actually verified with the police to make sure that... the snaps that we were posting to our 173 million daily active users were of what we thought they were. ""And we added a layer of context above that as well to describe what had happened. ""We also inserted into that story warnings of graphic content. ""So, we think that putting journalists into the fold is very important."" Mr Bell did not refer to Facebook by name. However, Mark Zuckerberg's company hasfaced criticism that it helped promote dozens of false stories,externalafter stopping using human editors. The company responded late last year by highlighting some of theprocesses it had put in place,externalto tackle the issue, including studying whether people became less likely to share an article if they had read it. Since then, it has announced several follow-up measures, the most recent of which is to block advertisers who repeatedly share stories thatthird-party fact-checkers,externalhave flagged as being false. However, explaining these processes to the public is inherently more challenging than Snap's ability to talk about its own in-house team of editors. Mr Bell suggests that it is harder to radicalise users on Snapchat than some other social media platforms Mr Bell was also asked whether Snapchat could be used to help inspire others to commit violence. ""We take both terrorism and hate speech very very seriously, and we have zero tolerance,"" he said. ""By design, Snapchat has been built to allow you to communicate with your best friends. ""We actually make it pretty difficult for you to build a large following. ""The situation that we live in today is that you could be approached on the street by a radical preacher, and it's very difficult to protect everyone from everything at any time. ""What I am saying it that it's much harder for radicalists to emerge and create a large following on Snapchat than it maybe is on other platforms.""

"Buildings at the centre were cordoned off by police today. A four-year-old boy has drowned while on holiday at an activity centre in Devon. The boy, from Weymouth, was found in a swimming pool atKnapp House Activity Centre,externalnear Bideford on Monday. Devon Narcotics Anonymous (DNA), which hosted a week-long event for members and their families, confirmed the boy was the child of one of its members. The centre said pool use was self-supervised, but DNA said swimming was supervised by centre lifeguards. More on the death and the latest Devon and Cornwall news. The boy had been on holiday in the area with his family, police said. He was reported missing and found in a swimming pool following an ""extensive search"" assisted by a helicopter. The boy was taken to North Devon District Hospital where he was pronounced dead. A statement on behalf of Knapp House Limited said: ""The group had the use of the pool on a self-supervised basis for recreational use - it was not part of the planned activity program that we provide. ""We are fully committed to understand exactly how this could have happened and will continue to liaise with the emergency services, the Health and Safety Executive and Narcotics Anonymous to establish this."" The DNA summer holiday campout committee, which organised the event, said: ""One of the activities we organize with Knapp House is the supervised use of their swimming pool with their trained lifeguards. ""Very tragically, something has gone horrifically wrong, and a young child of one of our members drowned in the pool. ""We are not aware of the exact details of how this happened, and the police are obviously investigating. ""We find all attempt at expressing our sorrow and concern for the parents and siblings of this child inadequate, but as is normal in our fellowship, they will have plenty of support as they face their tragedy.""

"Jean-Claude Juncker said there would be ""no negotiations"" on trade until the British government discussed a financial settlement The European Commission president has criticised the UK's Brexit negotiations, saying none of the papers provided so far are satisfactory. Jean-Claude Juncker reiterated that there would be no trade negotiations between the EU and UK until the divorce bill was settled. The prime minister's spokeswoman said the UK was in a ""good position"". But EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier said Brexit secretary David Davis had to ""start negotiating seriously"". The EU has previously said that it will not discuss trade issues with the UK until it has resolved three issues. One of the the sticking points is the rights of EU citizens living and working in the UK post-Brexit, and the rights of UK citizens in the EU. EU negotiators also argue a decision on the Irish border, and the size of a financial settlement between the EU and UK, must be met. But British negotiators have said they are not going to give up their biggest negotiating card at such an early phase. What is at stake in EU-UK talks? All you need to know about Brexit The EU's point man on Brexit talks The UK governmentpublished its position papers in August, one of which which called for no additional restrictions for goods already on the market in the UK and EU. The BBC's Europe correspondent Kevin Connolly said ""the British perception of the talks is more positive than the EU's"", and added UK officials were ""puzzled"" at how dismissive Mr Juncker was of the papers. Mr Juncker said: ""I find none of [the papers] truly satisfactory. ""We need to be crystal clear that we will begin no negotiations on the new economic and trade relationship between the UK and the EU before all these questions are resolved... that is the divorce between the EU and the UK."" Brexit secretary David Davis is due to meet EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier on Thursday for more talks He has previously claimed that the UK's Brexit bill could be Â£55bn, which Theresa May's government ministers consider unacceptable. Mrs May's spokeswoman added: ""We are seeking to agree by October Council that we can move to talk about our future relationship."" Later, a government spokesman said: ""The PM has made clear that we will be seeking a deep and special partnership with the EU, that works in the interests of businesses and consumers in both the UK and the EU. ""We have published a paper that lays out the government's aspirations for the UK's future customs arrangements, and also makes clear that we want an implementation period that avoids a cliff-edge for business and allows a smooth and orderly exit from the EU."" At the end of October, the 27 remaining EU leaders will meet and consider whether enough progress has been made on separation, rights and financial issues. Who's who: The people negotiating Brexit Keep single market for Brexit transition - Labour Economic issues first, say UK and German firms It is possible they could agree negotiations on trade and the UK's future relationship with the bloc. Michel Barnier is due to meet David Davis again on Thursday, and officials said the third set of Brexit talks between the two on Monday were cordial and productive. The talks involve more than 100 British negotiators, who will take part in 55 hours of discussions this week. At a press conference following Monday's negotiating session, Mr Barnier said the UK had to ""take positions on all separation issues"" and ""start negotiating seriously"". Mr Davis said the UK wanted the current week of talks to be about ""driving forwards the technical discussion across all the issues"". The UK is set to leave the EU by the end of March 2019, following last year's referendum vote.

"South Western Railway said there would be delays of at least 10 minutes Train delays at the UK's busiest railway station were expected to last until the end of the day following its reopening after engineering works. Ten of the platforms at London's Waterloo were shut for almost a month for an Â£800m project to boost capacity. The platforms came back into use on Tuesday but Network Rail testing then identified a signalling issue. One of the companies affected, South Western Railway, said there would be delays of at least 10 minutes. Buses were replacing trains on the Shepperton, Hampton Court and Chessington South branches and between Weybridge and Virginia Water. Compensation and other questions Some stations on routes to Waterloo were closed this morning and there were more problems caused by a broken-down freight train between Eastleigh and Southampton, while a broken-down train between Leatherhead and Effingham Junction in Surrey blocked lines. The first day of the upgrade project saw the platforms being demolished Ten Waterloo platforms were closed during the upgrade Network Rail said Waterloo had fully reopened following one of the ""largest and most complex"" upgrades in the station's history. A spokeswoman said a 1,000-strong team of engineers and trackside staff had been working 24 hours a day for the past three-and-a-half weeks to complete the work, which would boost capacity at the station by 30% by December 2018, providing space for another 45,000 passengers at morning and evening peaks. Becky Lumlock, route managing director at Network Rail, apologised to passengers for the delay and thanked them for their patience. She said: ""The work we have completed in three-and-a-half weeks this August will benefit passengers for decades to come. ""The longer platforms will create space for longer trains, making journeys more comfortable for passengers, particularly at the busiest times of day. ""Over the next 16 months, we'll turn our attention to the final stages of the redevelopment of the former international terminal."" The Â£800m station upgrade is to accommodate longer trains and provide space for 30% extra passengers Passengers have taken to social media to express their frustration at the problems: Allow Twitter content?

Jasper Johns said his journey from Kingston was delayed by up to 40 minutes. The 35-year-old said: ""There was an expectation or doubt that it would be ready, because they're pretty poor when they do these works anyway. ""But you've kind of had enough. Say 10 minutes more in the morning, then another 20 minutes perhaps in the evening, you take that over a week - it's an extra hour or so you spend commuting. Over three weeks. ""I've certainly felt more tired. I'm reasonably young and healthy, but my wife is seven months pregnant, and there's obviously older and younger people who commute as well, it's not as easy on them either."" Passengers were told in an email that services running across the whole South Western Railway network may be cancelled, delayed or revised. Anthony Smith, chief executive of the independent watchdog Transport Focus, said: ""Passengers will be disappointed that, after all the promises, communications and planning, the Waterloo upgrade slipped. Passengers booked tickets and made travel plans based on the promises made by the industry. ""Clearly the priority is to get things moving again: it is crucial that information is clear and plenty of staff are on hand to help. Then this must be reviewed to make sure the lessons of today are learnt and built into future events. ""In the meantime, every single passenger affected should claim compensation. Send a clear message to the industry and make sure your voice is heard."" Andy Mellors, managing director for South Western Railway, added: ""I'd like to thank our passengers for their patience over the past few weeks. ""It's clearly been a challenging time but these improvement works will help us deliver the increased capacity needed for the future.""

"This video can not be played Days of destruction: The story so far Two major dams outside Houston have begun overflowing as Storm Harvey pushes reservoirs past capacity. Flood control official Jeff Lindner said nearby communities could face further flooding as a result. President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump are in Texas to see the devastation caused by Hurricane Harvey, now downgraded to a tropical storm. Record rainfall has caused huge floods and is starting to affect Louisiana. Thousands of people have been forced to flee their homes in the Houston area while rescuers are trying to reach others that remain stranded. At least nine people are reported to have died, including six members of the same family whose van was swept away by rising floodwater, and a man in his 60s who apparently drowned while trying to swim to safety. What is it like to be in Houston? Hurricane Harvey: The climate link Images of 'landmark' flooding Four key effects of Houston floods Engineers have been releasing water to try to ease pressure on the Addicks and Barker dams, which control the amount of water in the Buffalo Bayou - the main river into Houston. But the water level in the Addicks reservoir west of Houston exceeded 108ft (32.9m) on Tuesday,data shows,external, causing it to flow over the top of defences.

"Will publishing pay ratios close the gap? The UK's biggest companies will have to reveal how much more their chief executives are paid compared with the average worker. The measure, which is part of a package of government policy initiatives, will oblige some 900 companies owned by shareholders to reveal the pay ratio between bosses and workers. But just how big is the gap at the top and is it worse across different sectors? Reality Check has been looking at the numbers. We already have some insight into executive pay, based onjoint research,externalby the High Pay Centre and the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD). The report examined the top 100 UK companies listed on the stock market and found chief executive salaries had dropped 17.4% in 12 months. The average FTSE 100 boss had received Â£4.5m in 2016, down from Â£5.4m in 2015. But while there was an overall fall in top pay, the gulf between top executives and average workers still persists. The average employee of a FTSE 100 company makes Â£48,000 a year (in contrast to the UK full-time average of Â£28,000). This means that for every Â£1 the average worker earns, their chief executive makes Â£129. The High Pay Centre says that while this has come down from 2015, when the ratio was Â£148-Â£1, it is still high when compared with the Â£45-Â£1 ratio 20 years ago. Pay ratios differ across sectors. Technology companies in the FTSE 100 have the lowest ratio, at Â£27-Â£1. At the other end, consumer services has the highest ratio, at Â£248-Â£1. However, executive pay in this sector is inflated by two companies  - WPP and Carnival - who pay their chief executives the top packages. The financial sector, which has come under a lot of scrutiny over banker bonuses in recent years, emerges pretty well, with a gap of Â£68-Â£1 - although that does reflect the relatively high pay of its average employee. Source:  High Pay Centre / CIPD For the likes of Stefan Stern, head of the High Pay Centre, the publication of pay ratios will provide greater transparency and ""concentrate minds on how the gap has grown"". Critics concede the policy will improve transparency, but they warn that pay ratios do not always tell the full story. The director general of the Institute of Directors, Stephen Martin, says: ""Pay ratios will sharpen the awareness of boards on the issue of remuneration, but they can be a crude measure."" One issue is that rather than reducing pay at the top (or increasing it at the bottom), a boss may look at other ways to reduce the ratio - for example, through outsourcing some jobs, increasing automation or hiring more part-time workers at the expense of full-time employees.

"It is no surprise that today's package of reforms to the way Britain's companies are run has fallen short of the crackdown on fat cat behaviour promised by Theresa May last year. The watering-down can has been used liberally since she initially promised workers on boards and binding shareholder votes on executive pay. The size of the climbdown is arguably as much to do with the scale of the original ambition as with the feebleness of the final proposals. The Tory attempt to shake up the way corporate Britain is run hit several obstacles. Lobbying by the business community was to be expected but there are some pragmatic and legal problems as well. Putting workers on boards is not as easy as it looks. Board directors are elected by shareholders. Can you force shareholders to vote for a director they might not want? What about multinationals like the big mining and oil companies? They are listed here but have the vast majority of their workers overseas. Do you put an unrepresentative British worker on the board or fly in a worker from Nigeria or Hong Kong for a UK PLC board meeting? UK companies must publish pay ratios May attacks 'unacceptable' executive pay Countries like Germany manage it but companies there have a very different board structure to the UK which comes with its own problems. Annual binding votes on pay are also problematic. Business has long argued that it is hard to attract top executives when the pay on offer is subject to retrospective change. (Although some will point out that is what workers on zero hours contracts are asked to agree to.) The proposals the government is trumpeting as victories will increase transparency, but lack teeth. A register of companies that face a revolt of 20% or more of their shareholders might be a list you don't want to be on but revolts of this magnitude are already widely reported and seldom result in the pay in question being cut. Sir Martin Sorrell has faced shareholder revolts over his pay for seven years running A published ratio of CEO pay to average worker pay is a step further than previous governments have taken but is subject to widely recognised flaws. Using this crude measure, investment banks will be seen as bastions of pay restraint compared with supermarkets as the average worker at Goldman Sachs makes several hundred thousand pounds a year. Nevertheless, once published this ratio will be helpful in judging a company's performance against its own benchmark (an incentive you might argue to start the ratio as high as possible and then manage it down!) but is of limited use to compare companies in different sectors. The government's intention to tighten up the way privately held companies are run is going to be interesting to watch. Usually the shareholders of a private company don't really need protection because the management and the shareholders are the same people. Driven by the high profile collapse of BHS, the government needed to be seen to do something but increased government intrusion and additional reporting requirements may be unwelcome to many big companies that value the reduced red tape that being private affords. The collapse of BHS drew criticism from Theresa May about corporate failings It's worth remembering that the Companies Act 2006 already requires company directors to consider the wider stakeholder community (employees, consumers, the environment) when making decisions. Widespread anger at huge pay differentials and corporate wrongdoing helped persuade the writers of the Conservative manifesto this wasn't enough. The government is therefore proposing a new law to make directors explain how well they are doing against those targets. Many will feel it's the government which has underdelivered against targets. Others might say it is another example of politicians promising big things only to find out they are harder to do than they looked.

"The Queensferry Crossing is opening on Wednesday With some handy change from two billion quid, we've got ourselves a splendid new piece of architecture. The Queensferry Crossingis the Firth of Forth's fifth, and its benefit goes well beyond the aesthetic, to be a vital link for the economy. But how vital? A transport expert at Napier University, Professor Tom Rye, told my colleague David Henderson that the evidence of benefit from such big infrastructure projects is not clear. For instance, he pointed out that Spain has more high-speed rail than any other European country, but it also has very high unemployment. Now, I'm no transport expert or a professor, but that seems an odd illustration of his argument. Spanish unemployment might be linked with quite a lot of other factors. Where he may have more of a point is the suggestion that pouring one's capital budget down the cable casing of nationwide high-speed broadband could be a more important way of connecting up the modern economy than pouring it into the concrete mix for more conventional road and rail. What marks out the Queensferry Crossing as an unusual bit of real estate is that it's not expanding transport capacity - not by much, anyway. It's a replacement. The Scottish government chose to maintain the same road space as the Forth Road Bridge (the 1964 one), which was based on future traffic growth that fell well short of reality. This was part of Holyrood's cross-party commitment to constraining traffic growth, for environmental reasons. The only relief of pressure from the existing bottleneck is that the older road crossing will be available for buses and hardy cyclists. In 50 years from now, that might look a bit silly. By then, if there's any common sense left in public policy, road use will be priced by which miles are travelled and at what times, rather than the blunt instrument of fuel and vehicle duty. Rather than keep a bottleneck at the same width until perhaps the 22nd Century, pricing could take the strain of delivering on environmental goals. Either way, road use will surely also have changed, through autonomous vehicles making more efficient use of space, and electric cars cutting down on emissions. So anyway, what are the economic claims made for the Queensferry Crossing? Ten years ago, the report which led to the current bridge being commissioned estimated the bridge would cost Â£1.4bn at 2002 prices (makes you wonder if the original budget was high-balled, when the pain of the Holyrood building fiasco was still raw). It then went on to count up the financial benefits. Those benefits depend heavily on the prospect of massive disruption from the older, corroding road crossing being closed or constrained by a decade or so of repairs. Transport Scotland reckoned that cable replacement, with the old bridge still in use, would cost up to Â£1.3bn, and the permanent loss of 3,200 jobs. Add up the other benefits of a sparkly new bridge, and you reach somewhere just north of Â£6bn. So 10 years ago, it was reckoned that for every pound spent on it, you could expect Â£4.31 back. That seems quite a good investment. This wasn't the only option for a new crossing. A look in the rear view mirror shows that three tunnel options were assessed, and a repeat of the Forth Road Bridge design. The most attractive such underwater option was about a mile east of the current bridge, between Inverkeithing Bay and Dalmeny headland. That would have required twin, five-mile bores through old mine workings and uncertain geology. It would, it was reckoned, have delivered more benefit - some Â£6.3bn, but it would have cost about Â£2.2bn. Hence, a significantly lower ratio: for Â£1 cost, benefit of Â£2.91. So what's next? Well, both the Scottish and UK governments would probably reassure you that they're on the case with roll-out of broadband - though not far or fast enough for some. Public transport campaigners want to see the balance of spend shift to rail, arguing that the Edinburgh-Perth services are running more slowly than they were 100 years ago, ""due to under-investment"". It is the Edinburgh-Glasgow rail corridor that is getting the big rail spend for now, to electrify it and cut 10 minutes off the journey from Queen Street to Waverley. Perhaps by no coincidence, the outline business case for Edinburgh's tram extension was published on the same day the Queensferry Crossing was being handed over by contractors. Ten years ago, the trams were the project SNP ministers wanted to stop, but in a Holyrood minority, they were outvoted. It went way over budget. An inquiry is trying to find out why. The Edinburgh Tram project went way over budget But the logic of extending it is quite strong. The case sets out a cost of stretching the tram from the New Town to Leith would be Â£165m, taking three years for construction, and with a benefit of Â£1.64 for each Â£1 spent. Yet another central belt project, goes the cry from the hills. Fair point, except that the parts of the economy that benefit most from relieving the pressure on the older Forth Road Bridge are the ones to the north. If it had closed, those job losses would almost certainly have been far worse in Fife, Tayside and into the north-east. Look at it another way: the key blockages for getting Scottish goods to key European export markets are not in Scotland, but around Birmingham and London.  Spending in the south can make a big difference to the north. The big northerly projects that are being prioritised are the A9, being dualled in stages between Perth and Inverness by 2025, and the A96 between the Highland capital and Aberdeen. And if you - or Professor Rye - want to see where infrastructure spending has a tangible benefit, look at Inverness. Before its completion in 1983 - with the Kessock Bridge across the Beauly Firth opened the previous year - the A9 was a tortuous travel nightmare, winding through small towns and twisting under narrow rail bridges. It was one of the reasons in the 1960s that Inverness lost out to Stirling in the competition to attract a new university campus. Now, drive north across the crossings of the Cromarty and Dornoch Firth, and you can see, in communities through the spine of Scotland and the far north, that a good road is a vital piece of infrastructure. Its benefits can't always be measured by accountants in Net Present Value. The open road brings jobs, incomers, tourists, social change and confidence. A congested road can choke that off. All this goes some way to responding to the challenge of picking up the pace of growth - a challenge underlined last week by the report on 2016-17 Government Expenditure and Revenue Scotland (GERS). Infrastructure helps the economy move more smoothly. It gets goods to customers, and workers to work. Broadband does both of those too, letting workers operate away from base, and helping the digital economy spread. A further, crucial part of the growth story is the quality of those workers and of what they produce. Government is a big spender on education and skills. But also being discussed on Good Morning Scotland today was a parallel question about investment - is it spending on the right priorities, and matching skills to market demands, when so many in Generation Y, the millennials, are in roles which don't use those hard-won skills? Building a bridge between Fife and Lothian is an impressive achievement. Building a bridge to the educational demands of the future economy and society requires even more ingenuity.

"She was a violent white supremacist. But an encounter in prison changed her life forever. Angela King had gone to the bar expecting trouble. The neo-Nazi had arrived at the local dive in South Florida with a gang of violent skinheads. King, 23, sauntered in with a 9mm pistol in the waistband of her jeans. She and her friends wore combat boots and coloured braces, their skin emblazoned with racist iconography. ""I had tattoos all over my body. I had Vikings tattooed on my chest, a swastika on my middle finger and 'Sieg Heil' on the inside of my bottom lip, which was the Hitler salute,"" King says. They hated black people and Jews and were also virulently homophobic. Plus, one of them was her boyfriend. So King didn't dare to admit that she was secretly gay. As the group drank they became louder and more aggressive. A large brawl broke out after a man ordering a drink took exception to King's boyfriend. ""He said something about his tattoo and that was it. It took nothing to get my boyfriend swinging,"" King says. Angela's tattoos, like those of other white supremacists, were inspired by Norse mythology King and another woman from her group grabbed the man's companion and beat her up in the bathroom. They fled after hearing the police had been called. ""We drove around all pumped up and started talking about what a race war would be like in the US,"" she says. ""We talked about how it was OK to hurt people who aren't like us and we decided to go and find a place to rob."" They settled on a convenience store, but farcically it had closed while they argued about who should go in. They eventually targeted an adult video shop, reasoning that pornography ""wasn't beneficial to the white race"".

She went to an expensive private Baptist school and attended Catholic Church services each week. But she had a secret that left her confused, angry and resentful. ""From very early on I felt I was abnormal because I was attracted to people of the same sex,"" King says. King kept her sexual identity hidden. ""I knew I had to keep it to myself. My mother used to say to me, 'I will never stop loving you... except you better never bring home a black person or a woman."" Angela hid her sexual identity when she was growing up King started going to public school when she was 10 after her family moved. She struggled with her weight and self-confidence, and was called names by fellow students. When verbal bullying became physical, she finally snapped. ""When I was 13 a girl ripped open my shirt in front of the entire class,"" she says. ""I was in a training bra and felt completely humiliated. It just blew the lid off the anger and rage I had been holding on to for so long."" King fought back and realised violence and aggression gave her a sense of control that she had never felt before. She soon became established as the school and neighbourhood bully. Her parents divorced and while she and her sister stayed with their mother, their brother went to live with her father. Desperate to belong, she joined a group of teenagers into punk rock who were starting to flirt with neo-Nazism. ""These younger skinheads were known as 'fresh cuts',"" King says. ""I joined them because they accepted my violence and anger without question."" This video can not be played Listen to Angela King explain how her opinions on race ""crumbled away"" in prison The group pasted racist flyers around neighbourhoods at night and started fights with anyone who disagreed with them. King assumed she had found the right path, because many of their views reflected the casual racism and prejudice she had heard at home. King was proud of her new identity and wore it ""like a mantle"" each day. Despite this, little action was taken at school. In one earth science lesson she put a swastika flag on a model she had built of a moon base. It was left on display for weeks before anyone noticed. Although the model was taken down, King still received a B grade for it after her mother argued she had the right to freedom of speech. Her parents didn't object to her beliefs, but warned her she was ""too blatant about them."" Angela, right, shaving the head of a girl dating a skinhead in her group King began to hang out with older skinheads and joined a violent white extremist group in her teens. ""They told me that Jews had owned the slave ships and had brought black people to America to endanger the white race. ""It sounds ridiculous but when you are uneducated or trying to fit in, you soak up the new reality like a sponge."" King was asked to leave her school when she was 16 and went to work in various fast food restaurants. Her mother eventually kicked her out for causing too much trouble and she slept in cars and on friends' sofas. It was around this time, in 1998, that King was involved in the robbery of the adult video shop. Soon afterwards she fled to Chicago with her boyfriend who was wanted for another hate crime. However, she was arrested weeks later and taken to the Federal Detention Centre in Miami. Angela was sentenced for robbery in February 1999 It was the first time she had lived in close quarters with people from different cultures and backgrounds. ""People knew why I was in there and I got dirty looks and comments. I assumed I would spend my time with my back to the wall, fighting,"" King says. What King did not expect was the hand of friendship - especially from a black woman. ""I was in the recreation area smoking when a Jamaican woman said to me, 'Hey, do you know how to play cribbage?'"" King had no idea what it was and was taught to play. It was the start of an unlikely friendship and King found her racist belief system crumbling as a result. Her friendship circle widened as she was taken under the wing of a wider group of Jamaican women, some of whom had been convicted for carrying drugs into the US. ""I hadn't really known any people of colour before, but here were these women who asked me difficult questions but treated me with compassion,"" King says. With their help, she started to take responsibility for her past actions. During her first year in the detention centre she was tipped off that a newspaper article was coming out about her case. She told one of her new friends how worried she was about the publicity. ""My friend had a job that meant she got out early to help prepare breakfast. The day it came out she stole the paper and hid it so no-one could read it. She, a black woman, did that for me, an ignorant white woman who was inside for a hate crime."" Angela, third from left, became friends with a group of Jamaican women in prison King was sentenced in 1999 to five years and moved to the county jail so she could give evidence against one of her former gang. When she was returned to the detention centre she discovered her circle of friends had been moved on to a prison in Tallahassee. ""Suddenly my support network wasn't there,"" she says. ""I was heartbroken."" Meanwhile some new inmates had joined the detention centre, including another Jamaican woman who took an instant dislike to King. ""People said she had been in violent gangs and was a real badass. One day as I passed, she asked: 'How do you even get to be like that?' I stopped and answered her as fully and honestly as I could."" The two women began to talk and realised although they came from different worlds they had had similar experiences on the streets. Slowly the antagonism faded and they formed a bond. They realised over time that their feelings went beyond friendship. ""We realised we had fallen in love with each other. We were like, 'How on Earth did this happen?'"" ""We spent a lot of time together talking and shared a cell for a while. It got quite serious but we had to keep it secret."" For both women it was their first serious gay relationship. King's girlfriend was sent on to the jail in Tallahassee before her. King says it felt ""like torture"" and they wrote to each other via intermediaries. However, the relationship fizzled out a few months after King was transferred to the same prison. Angela was released in 2001 and earned a degree in sociology and psychology When King was released in 2001 she was determined not to fall back into old habits. She was also keen to meet other gay people and started by talking to people in chat rooms. ""I was very honest about my past. I found acceptance in the gay community and realised I wasn't alone."" King went to community college to study sociology and psychology. She wanted to understand if her experience of extremism was a common one. While there she made contact with the local Holocaust Centre, and sat down with a Holocaust survivor in 2004 to share her life story. ""She was very stern, but afterwards she looked me in the eye and said 'I forgive you,'"" King says. Angela with holocaust survivor Leah Roth. She survived four concentration camps but lost most of her family She has been doing public speaking for the centre ever since. Then in 2011 she went to an international conference where she met other former extremists. ""I was excited to meet other people who had got involved in violent extremism and then got out. I wasn't alone,"" King says. She met two Americans who had founded a blog called Life After Hate, in which they shared their stories. They agreed to work together to create a non-profit organisation to help other people leave the far right community. King was all too aware of the hurdles people wishing to leave white supremacist groups had to overcome. She had tried to walk away following the Oklahoma bombing in 1995. ""I just remember watching all of this horrific television footage of children being pulled from rubble. Then I found out the bomber Timothy McVeigh shared many of my views,"" she says. Angela is having her old racists tattoos lasered and covered with other peaceful images King was under house arrest at the time but also stopped using her phone. One day she found bullet holes across the front of her apartment block. Her extremist friends hinted they had something to do with it. ""It's not something where you can just say: 'I've changed my mind.' There are serious and oftentimes violent repercussions for trying to walk away from something like that,"" King says. Without outside support, King didn't feel able to leave. She now uses that experience to help others. ""People in extremist groups wrap their entire identities around it. Everything in their life has to be changed, from the way they think, to the people they associate with, to dealing with permanent tattoos."" The organisation runs a programme called Exit USA that stages interventions. It also offers mentoring and points people trying to leave to different resources. White nationalists gathered at the University of Virginia on 11 August, ahead of a Unite the Right rally A group of around 60 former extremists provide peer support to each other. The recent violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, has been particularly difficult to deal with. ""Current events can bring up guilt and shame,"" King says. ""We are busier than ever and are running on fumes right now."" Life After Hate had its government funding cut back by the Trump administration in June, but King says personal donations from around the world have helped make up the shortfall. Angela with her co-founders of Life After Hate Meanwhile she has reached a better place in her own life. Her relationship with her parents has improved and she believes they now accept the fact she is gay although she says she ""doesn't care"" if they do. She has also slowly started to forgive herself for her past mistakes. ""I have a lot of healthy guilt about who I was and the things I did to hurt others and myself. But I know I would not have been able to do this work had I not had those experiences,"" she says. King is having her old tattoos lasered - a process that started after she left prison.

"Elisabeth Kendall in Sanaa, Yemen Osama bin Laden shared an unlikely interest with many other jihadists - writing verse. These poems might not win any literary prizes, but Elisabeth Kendall is fascinated by them. Could they help in the fight against extremism? Back in the late 80s, Kendall decided to study Arabic at university. An Egyptian writer, Naguib Mahfouz, had just won the Nobel Prize for Literature and Kendall was annoyed how difficult it was to find any of his books in translation. Learning Arabic was apparently the only way to find out if he was good or not. She also thought that picking such a difficult subject might make it easier to get into Oxford (she did). It helped, too, that the choice would annoy her parents. ""I could have rebelled in lots of ways - I could have done drugs or become a prostitute or something,"" she says. ""But I decided to study Arabic. I think that was quite painful enough for them."" Over the next 20 years, Kendall became an expert in Arabic literature - any qualms about her ability to get into Oxford were wildly misplaced. She focused on avant-garde Egyptian works, largely the angst-filled poems that appeared after the country's defeat to Israel in the 1967 Middle East War. She tracked down authors from that time. She translated their efforts. The subject became her life. Until one day she realised it was, essentially, useless. ""I ended up being pretty bored at conferences where everyone talks about some book no one's really heard of, goes into enormous detail about it and never works out why it actually matters,"" she says. ""I just thought: 'Here I am with this massive amount of training' - probably 20 years of analysing literature at that point - 'how can I make this useful?"" Her answer to that question likely annoyed her parents all over again - she decided to study the poetry of jihadism. Today, Kendall - a senior research fellow in Arabic and Islamic Studies at Oxford University - is arguably the world's foremost expert on jihadist poetry. She can, off-hand, chat about poems written by everyone from Osama Bin Laden to Ayman al-Zawahiri, al-Qaeda's current leader (Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, leader of so-called Islamic State, does not write poetry, but did do his PhD thesis on the subject). She keeps watch on multiple jihadist poetry groups through the phone app Telegram. She even has a playlist of jihadist poems on her phone, sandwiched between one of Handel compositions and another of party tunes (it features a lot of Pet Shop Boys). Kendall's eclectic playlists Some will find her work upsetting or controversial. But Kendall's convinced it is important, giving insight into just why jihadism flourishes, especially in the Middle East. British security services clearly agree, as they are known to have considered using poetry, among other creative methods, to combat extremism. Kendall started looking into poems by going online and getting hold of three years' worth of magazines produced by al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, the group's arm in Yemen. The peninsula is the birthplace of Arabic literature, so the choice seemed appropriate. She quickly discovered that poems featured on almost a fifth of pages. ""It was astonishing,"" she says. ""I knew it was important as soon as I saw how much there was. Why would they be wasting their time on it otherwise? Plus, anybody who's spent time in the Middle East knows how important poetry is. Any tin-pot taxi driver in Cairo can recite poetry."" The poems Kendall found weren't simply propaganda. Yes, there were a lot calling for attacks and ones urging people to join the group (""Where are you as Muhammad's community burns in flames?""), but there were others lamenting dead friends (""I know you're with Allahâ¦ but, if I'm honest with myself, I am going to miss you"") and even ones trying to instil conservative values in women (""How much she pleased me when she walked about not letting her veil fall,"" goes one of those, clearly from a male point of view). Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula van, offering jihadist CDs and books What struck her most about them, though, was not that variety, but how much they repurposed old poems from hundreds of years ago. ""It's actually one of the very, very few occasions where I thought that my undergraduate degree in Islamic studies had some use, because having spent so much time looking at classical poetry, I was able to read one of these and go, 'That sounds vaguely familiar,' then trace it back."" She discovered that over half were plagiarised from the classical tradition. Nearly 10% turned out, ironically, to be from the pre-Islamic era. Even the new poems were written so they looked as if they had been dreamt up during the time of the Prophet Muhammad, rather than by a bored jihadist driving through a desert a few weeks before. It was as if al-Qaeda wanted anyone hearing them to think they could have been written by a distant ancestor, someone just like them. ""If I'm sitting here as a literary judge on the Booker Prize or something, I'd say most of this stuff's utter rubbish,"" Kendall says. ""But it's not designed to be good literature - it's designed to plug into a tribal tradition that's authentic and speaks to people's hearts, and it does that."" Kendall could have just stayed in her office glued into jihadist social networks to research these poems, but she didn't. Not long into her research, she went to Sanaa, Yemen's now tragically war-torn capital, to see what material was there. Kendall in the Yemeni desert ""I started hunting around bookshops, and you wouldn't get the stuff easily,"" she says. ""It was difficult to know what terminology to use. 'Poetry about jihad?' That didn't work. It turned out to be 'Enthusiastic poetry', 'Poetry for a cause'. I'd say that and, 'Ah!', a backdoor would open and there you go."" She also surveyed Yemeni tribespeople on poetry (among many other topics), to check it was important to their daily lives - some 84% of men and 69% of women said it was - and while travelling around sometimes played her minders jihadist songs from her phone just to gauge their reactions. ""Once, one turned around and went: 'Doctor, this is rubbish! If you want good jihadi poetry, we'll find you good jihadi poetry.'"" Kendall gives regular talks on the subject and if you hear one you could be startled. At an event in London earlier this year, she happily read excerpts from one of her ""favourites"", and later said, of two al-Qaeda poets, that ""these guys were so talented, even I felt a pang of regret when they got droned."" Kendall with tribesmen in Yemen But her audiences never look shocked, because it's always clear her sympathy lies entirely with the Yemenis exploited by such groups. Yemen has sadly long been a country with so few opportunities that jihadism could seem to some people like their only option. ""I get a sense of desperation [sometimes in these poems],"" Kendall says. ""'What can we do? We have corrupt leaders who've pocketed all the aid money, who don't invest in us, and they're the ones supported by the West. We just need to take over, implement Sharia, ban everything and we'll be ok.' ""I mean, it's desperate stuff."" Kendall's sympathy for the Yemenis has found her working beyond academia. She's involved in educational projects in the country and has helped establish a newspaper to give locals a voice (with a poetry page, naturally). She even represents tribes from the Mahra province, in the east, flying around the world to get their views heard at the UN and elsewhere. She speaks at their inter-tribal meetings, an honorary man for the occasion. Kendall speaking about her research in Riyadh Jihadists know who she is due to all this. Earlier this year, while passing time in Dulles airport, in Washington DC, she logged onto some jihadist communications and found herself mentioned. She also believes some members of al-Qaeda once came to check her out in Yemen, when she was working with the tribes. ""They knew who I was. They knew what I'd published. They knew how to argue,"" she says, still clearly unnerved by the occasion. Did they have guns? I ask. ""Yes, but everyone has guns,"" she says, her laughter breaking the tension. Could poetry help turn such people away from jihad? ""I think it could,"" she says. ""I'm not suggesting counter-terrorism experts start writing poetry. That'd be a huge mistake and counter-productive, because it wouldn't be authentic."" But countries could help fund publications that do promote anti-jihadist poetry written by locals. Kendall insists you can find such poems if you look closely and give people the opportunity to speak. Pseudonyms would be essential, unfortunately. Jihadist poetry has clearly taken over Kendall's life in a similar way that avant-garde Egyptian literature once did. ""I do live and breathe this stuff,"" she says. She has even got to the point where she makes jokes about it, although she says that's normal for anyone working with jihadism. ""You have to have a sense of humour when doing this, otherwise how would you continue?"" But this time, her obsession seems to only partly be because she finds the subject fascinating. It's clear another driver is she simply thinks it is important. ""Lots of people spend all their time looking at what a group like Islamic State pumps out in English. And you could do that and feel like you're getting somewhere [in understanding them], and maybe you would be with a small group of foreign fighters. But that completely neglects the vast majority of these groups. ""We always ask the question, 'What radicalises people?' and not the bigger question, 'What enables these groups to be tolerated among well-armed populations?' And the way they do that is just getting into the rhythm of the local culture with things like poems. ""If they didn't do that, they wouldn't survive. And if they didn't have a safe haven, foreign fighters would have nowhere to go.""

"Facebook's co-founder Mark Zuckerberg has urged his young daughter to play outside and enjoy the wonders of being a kid, in a heartfelt letter posted on his social media site. The letter was published on Monday to announce the birth of his second child, August, with wife Priscilla Chan. In the gushing missive, the parents speak about the magic of childhood and the importance of play. The couple posted a similar letter to daughter Max in 2015. The post,,externalwhich appears alongside a family photo on Mr Zuckerberg's Facebook page, encourages the new arrival not to ""grow up too fast"". ""The world can be a serious place. That's why it's important to make time to go outside and play,"" said the letter, signed ""Mom and Dad"". The call to discover a childhood outdoors is at odds with the aims of the billionaire's social media empire. ""I hope you run as many laps around our living room and yard as you want. And then I hope you take a lot of naps,"" the parents wrote. ""Childhood is magical. You only get to be a child once, so don't spend it worrying too much about the future,"" they said. It marks a lighter tone from the open letter written towelcome Max,external, which reflected on the problems facing younger generations and how technological progress will drive change. At that time, the couple said they woulddonate their fortuneto the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative to make the world a better place for Max to grow up in. The organisation has pledged billions of dollars to improve life for their children's generation with goals such as eliminating disease. But the parents wanted to shield their latest addition from these kinds of concerns, telling their daughter not to worry about the future, adding: ""You've got us for that."" ""You will be busy when you're older, so I hope you take time to smell all the flowers and put all the leaves you want in your bucket now,"" they said.

"The majority of people mis-sold payment protection insurance may not yet have made a claim - and they are being urged to do so by Arnold Schwarzenegger. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has set a deadline of 29 August, 2019, for the final PPI claims to be made. A major advertising campaign by the FCA features a model head and voice of Arnie - urging people to act now. So far, Â£27bn has been paid out in compensation with major banks having set aside more than Â£37bn. PPI was supposed to cover repayments of loans if policyholders fell ill or lost their job. Millions of people who did not want or need PPI, or could have never made a claim, were mis-sold PPI primarily between 1990 and 2010. The subsequent compensation scheme has revealed it to be the UK's biggest financial mis-selling scandal. The new advert, in cinemas and on television from Tuesday, features an animatronic model of Schwarzenegger's head. In the voiceover, the actor and former governor of California, urges people to ""make a decision"" over PPI claims and to ""do it now!"". There are also billboards in a similar style. Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the FCA, said: ""Our campaign aims to cut through the noise on PPI. We want to encourage people to decide whether to find out if they had PPI and whether to complain or not."" The Â£42m awareness campaign, which includes a dedicated call centre for PPI queries, is being paid for by the 18 banks, building societies and credit card providers which sold the most PPI. Eddie Harrison, from Glasgow, was a freelancer and so did not need the insurance, but was told he could not have had a credit card without it. He said his pursuit of compensation took three years. ""The first offer that they gave me was Â£2.86, but the actual amount that they ended up paying me was a four-figure sum,"" he said. ""I had an account with this bank from when I was a little kid. ""I had my home insurance with them. I had my mortgage with them. I had pretty much everything with them. ""Obviously I don't have that anymore because there is a distrust between me and the bank I was with."" He said that only after writing letters, making phone calls and taking his case to the financial ombudsman did he finally have a satisfactory result. ""At the end of the day, there were thousands of pounds that were wrongly taken from my account that were eventually put back in again. ""I will never know if it was the full amount, but it was thousands of pounds that belonged to me that were returned under duress, so I would do it all again and certainly recommend to anyone else to do it,"" he said. More information on PPI and how you can claim is available on theFCA website,external. A free phone line, managed by the FCA, can be called on 0800 101 8800. Various templates are also available to download, along with guidance on claiming, on websites such asWhich?,external,MoneySavingExpert,external, andResolver,external. Cliff D'Arcy worked in a bank's PPI department for 11 years and said that sales were incredibly lucrative for the industry. Now, as a freelance financial journalist, he believes that there has been a degree of underestimation in the figures and that many fair claims for compensation were dismissed. The regulator, the FCA, said that many people may still be unaware that they ever had PPI and anyone who had a loan should check any paperwork they still had. Many banks no longer have paperwork for loans and cards from that time. A dedicated call centre will be set up as part of the FCA's multi-million pound campaign unveiled later. A spokeswoman for UK Finance, which represents the major banks, said: ""We fully support the introduction of the FCA's PPI mis-selling deadline. ""The regulator's deadline for PPI complaints provides additional clarity for consumers, with the accompanying awareness campaign intended to prompt action and help ensure that customers who deserve compensation receive it."" Consumer groups, such as Which?, say that now a deadline has been set, banks should do more to make it easier for people to make a claim, which can be done for free. These groups are concerned that consumers will go to claims management companies - businesses that offer to do the paperwork but take a cut of up to a third of any payout. Resolver, a website that offers free advice to consumers on how to complain, said that more than 80% of the PPI complaints made to the financial ombudsman last year were made by claims managers, and that there are 1,388 claims managers registered in the UK. It is likely that the two-year deadline will lead to a wave of text messages and calls from firms selling leads to these companies. But Nick Baxter, chairman of the Professional Financial Claims Association, the trade body for claims companies, said its members kept to a code of conduct which controlled the amount of time people could be contacted after ticking a box to accept marketing calls. He added that their fees were transparent and justified and that many people would not have received a payout at all, had they not used these services. These companies, consumer groups, and the regulator are also raising awareness of a Supreme Court case, known as the Plevin case, which means 2.4 million rejected compensation claims may now be able to make a fresh appeal. The ruling dealt with the case of a financial company's client not being made aware of a commission being paid when they were sold PPI. The court agreed that the company's failure to tell its client that it was receiving a large commission for the sale was unfair. Now the FCA has ruled that banks should have declared its commission if it was over 50%. If they did not declare it, then the customer is entitled to the return of any commission over 50%, plus interest, even if the PPI was not mis-sold.

"This video can not be played Days of destruction: The story so far Two major dams outside Houston have begun overflowing as Storm Harvey pushes reservoirs past capacity. Flood control official Jeff Lindner said nearby communities could face further flooding as a result. President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump are in Texas to see the devastation caused by Hurricane Harvey, now downgraded to a tropical storm. Record rainfall has caused huge floods and is starting to affect Louisiana. Thousands of people have been forced to flee their homes in the Houston area while rescuers are trying to reach others that remain stranded. At least nine people are reported to have died, including six members of the same family whose van was swept away by rising floodwater, and a man in his 60s who apparently drowned while trying to swim to safety.

"UK companies now have to reveal how much chief executives are paid, compared to other employees Prime Minister Theresa May has been accused by Labour and trade unions of ""watering down"" plans to tackle corporate excess. But Downing Street said Mrs May had been ""consistent"" in her approach. Under government reforms, the UK's biggest firms will have to reveal how much more their chief executives are paid compared with the average worker. Companies will also be encouraged to represent workers' voices on boards. Unions attacked the plans, saying they were ""feeble"", and Labour said the prime minister had backtracked on promises. However, a Downing Street spokeswoman said Mrs May ""wants to improve workers' representation and that's going to be achieved with part of this report, which is about changes to the corporate governance code."" ""From her perspective, her position has been consistent and has not changed,"" the spokeswoman added. The government has released measures aimed at increasing boardroom transparency in publicly listed companies. Business Secretary Greg Clark said the changes would make firms ""more accountable to their employees and shareholders"". The new corporate governance laws, which are due to come into effect by June 2018, will force some 900 publicly listed companies to reveal the pay ratio between bosses and workers. Reality Check: How big is the pay gap? Simon Jack: The great corporate climbdown May attacks 'unacceptable' executive pay Bosses of the UK's 100 biggest listed firms earned Â£4.5m on average last year, and typically took home 129 times more than the average employee at those firms. The Conservatives hadpromised in their manifestothat executive pay should be approved by an annual vote of shareholders. However, the new measures instead propose that those public companies who face a shareholder revolt on pay will be named on a register overseen by the Investment Association. BBC business editor Simon Jack said the government had watered down plans in the face of business lobbying, but also pragmatic and legal problems. At the weekend, Theresa May attacked firms who hand bosses excessive pay ""as the unacceptable face of capitalism"". Writing inthe Mail on Sunday,external, she said the excesses of some chief executives was ""damaging the social fabric of our country"". Businesses will also have to ensure that staff of listed companies are better represented at board level, either by allowing workers to nominate a director, creating an employee advisory council or assigning a non-executive director to represent the workforce. This requirement will be included in the UK Corporate Governance Code, which operates on a ""comply or explain"" basis. Business Secretary Greg Clark will unveil the government plans Mrs May had initially promised to force companies to have an employee representative on the board, during her bid to become Conservative Party leader last July. However, she backtracked in November and said businesses would not be mandated to implement the move. Labour accused the government of ""watering down"" an original promise to increase workers' voice to a lone representative on the board of directors or a separate employee advisory council. ""Each of these will be easily outvoted or ignored,"" said Rebecca Long-Bailey, Labour's shadow business secretary. TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said the government's reforms were ""feeble"". ""Just a year ago the prime minister repeatedly promised fundamental reform of business and that's because there was real public concern about boardroom greed, about tax avoidance and exploitative work practices,"" she told the BBC. ""I am afraid that the government has bottled it in the face of business lobbying and that doesn't bode well for really tackling some of these big problems,"" she added. Vince Cable, leader of the Liberal Democrats, said: ""The overblown rhetoric from Theresa May is completely at odds with the weakness of the new rules."" While the majority of the new measures will only apply to publicly-listed companies, the government has asked the Financial Reporting Council, the City watchdog, to draw up a voluntary set of corporate governance principles for large private companies. It follows the collapse of BHS last year which left 11,000 people out of a job and the company's pension schemes in a perilous state. The department store chain was sold by Sir Philip Green to a former bankrupt, Dominic Chappell, for Â£1 in 2015. Commenting of the corporate governance reforms, Paul Drechsler, president of the CBI business lobby group, said: ""Companies take this seriously and look forward to working closely with the government to ensure the UK maintains its reputation as a global leader in this field and as a primary location for international investment. ""The CBI is very clear that the unacceptable behaviour of a few firms does not reflect the high standards and responsible behaviour of the vast majority of companies."" It is no surprise that today's package of reforms to the way Britain's companies are run has fallen short of the crackdown on fat cat behaviour promised by Theresa May last year. The watering-down can has been used liberally since she initially promised workers on boards and binding shareholder votes on executive pay. The size of the climbdown is arguably as much to do with the scale of the original ambition as with the feebleness of the final proposals. The Tory attempt to shake up the way corporate Britain is run hit several obstacles. Lobbying by the business community was to be expected, but there are some pragmatic and legal problems as well.

"This video can not be played Doddie Weir says his focus now is ""driving to secure a solution"" to MND Two months ago former Scotland rugby international Doddie Weir announced he has motor neurone disease. After careers as a sportsman, farmer and after-dinner speaker, he spoke to BBC Scotland's John Beattie about his greatest challenge yet. Sitting in the stands at Melrose Rugby Club, Doddie Weir, is in positive mood. It is more than 18 months since the 47-year-old first noticed the symptoms of his motor neurone disease (MND). They began when he trapped his hand in a door. ""Being an old rugby boy come farmer I thought 'ah, that was a bit tender' - and I lost a bit of power in my hand,"" he recalls. ""I thought maybe I'd broken a little bone but it would be OK. It would soon mend and fix but during the winter months it got progressively worse and I lost a lot of power in my left hand. ""Not long after that the twitching started in my left hand and that was the giveaway. There's something wrong here."" Doddie Weir won 61 caps for Scotland during his playing career When he finally went to his doctor, he was referred to a specialist and was soon given the most devastating of diagnoses. Motor neurone disease involves progressive damage to the nerves, leading to muscle wastage. There is currently no cure and while there are exceptions - including the physicist Stephen Hawking - about half of sufferers die within three years of developing symptoms. At the moment it mainly affects Doddie's hands, making everyday tasks like fastening a button difficult. ""If you were to put a sponge cake in front of me I would find it very difficult to squash it,"" he explains. Doddie Weir diagnosed with MND Extract from Living with Lions documentary MSP weeps during Doddie Weir tribute Doddie Weir is not the first rugby international to face MND. In 2011, South Africa's Joost van der Westhuizen revealed he had been diagnosed with the condition. Some researchers have suggested that repeated head injuries can increase the chances of developing the disease. Could Doddie Weir's rugby career be to blame for his current condition? He has asked himself and his doctors that question but he remains sceptical. ""We have maybe 450 to 500 sufferers of MND in Scotland - and quite a large majority probably wouldn't have played rugby. ""I don't think there's any connection to it at the moment but the reason behind that is that there's maybe not a lot of studies put together, not a lot of work or focus put on MND at the moment in the world, so hopefully we can try and change that and try to find the solution."" The work of fellow MND sufferer and former rugby international Joost van der Westhuizen has been an inspiration to Doddie Weir Joost van der Westhuizen died earlier this year - but his final years while living with MND were an inspiration to Doddie. During that time he set up the J9 Foundation which seeks to raise awareness as well as improve the emotional and physical care of MND sufferers. The most important tip, Doddie says, was the benefit of ""positive thinking"". ""He probably brought me on to understand what it was all about. I met him at Murrayfield a number of years ago. A very inspirational character. ""So with his J9 Foundation it was really the first port of call that I was going to do, to see what he's done before - because there's a frustrating part with MND and that's the solution. That's not been found yet. It's a terminal illness and that's quite hard to take."" The support of family and friends has been tremendously important to Doddie Weir The anguish Doddie feels is less for himself but more for his family. The normally cheerful exterior cracks for a few seconds as he speaks of his teenage sons. ""Any parent is worried about the future with their kids.

Since announcing his illness over the summer he has spent time with his family in New Zealand, building memories that will endure. ""Before that we went to Twickenham as well - which wasn't such a memory because Scotland got beat by 60 points,"" he jokes. Doddie, who won 61 Scottish caps, has now set up the Doddie'5 Discretionary Trust - which makes use of his rugby shirt number - to  provide practical and financial help to his family as his condition develops. A foundation, My Name'5 Doddie, is also to be set up in the next few months to raise funds for research into a cure for MND and to provide grants to people living with the condition. ""Ultimately it's down to funding - it's all down to a bit of money. I think that's what lapsed before because there's not that many people with the condition and the drug companies think, don't want to be bothered with it."" He is under no illusions. He knows there will be dark times ahead - but he has a ""driving focus"" that will keep him going. ""You have to have a positive outlook - that's what the J9 boys were saying. Somebody has put this card into my hands and with that, I have got to try to make a difference - and hopefully we do.""

"This video can not be played Days of destruction: The story so far Two major dams outside Houston have begun overflowing as Storm Harvey pushes reservoirs past capacity. Flood control official Jeff Lindner said nearby communities could face further flooding as a result. President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump are in Texas to see the devastation caused by Hurricane Harvey, now downgraded to a tropical storm. Record rainfall has caused huge floods and is starting to affect Louisiana. Thousands of people have been forced to flee their homes in the Houston area while rescuers are trying to reach others that remain stranded. At least nine people are reported to have died, including six members of the same family whose van was swept away by rising floodwater, and a man in his 60s who apparently drowned while trying to swim to safety.

Meanwhile flood gauges on the Barker dam have themselves been put out of action by the deluge. President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump touched down in Texas on Tuesday and headed to a briefing on the storm Officials said the overspill could cause further flooding in areas close to the Buffalo Bayou, but the exact impact was unknown. ""This is something we've never faced before, so we're trying our best to wrap around what exactly this water is going to do,"" said Jeff Lindner, meteorologist with the Harris County Flood Control District.

"Buildings at the centre were cordoned off by police today. A four-year-old boy has drowned while on holiday at an activity centre in Devon. The boy, from Weymouth, was found in a swimming pool atKnapp House Activity Centre,externalnear Bideford on Monday. Devon Narcotics Anonymous (DNA), which hosted a week-long event for members and their families, confirmed the boy was the child of one of its members. The centre said pool use was self-supervised, but DNA said swimming was supervised by centre lifeguards. More on the death and the latest Devon and Cornwall news. The boy had been on holiday in the area with his family, police said. He was reported missing and found in a swimming pool following an ""extensive search"" assisted by a helicopter. The boy was taken to North Devon District Hospital where he was pronounced dead. A statement on behalf of Knapp House Limited said: ""The group had the use of the pool on a self-supervised basis for recreational use - it was not part of the planned activity program that we provide. ""We are fully committed to understand exactly how this could have happened and will continue to liaise with the emergency services, the Health and Safety Executive and Narcotics Anonymous to establish this."" The DNA summer holiday campout committee, which organised the event, said: ""One of the activities we organize with Knapp House is the supervised use of their swimming pool with their trained lifeguards. ""Very tragically, something has gone horrifically wrong, and a young child of one of our members drowned in the pool. ""We are not aware of the exact details of how this happened, and the police are obviously investigating. ""We find all attempt at expressing our sorrow and concern for the parents and siblings of this child inadequate, but as is normal in our fellowship, they will have plenty of support as they face their tragedy.""

"This video can not be played Days of destruction: The story so far Floodwaters are expected to rise still further in the inundated Texan city of Houston, where more than 30,000 people have been forced from their homes in the wake of Hurricane Harvey. Unprecedentedly heavy rains have fallen for three days and the downpour is forecast to continue. Harvey, downgraded to a tropical storm, is now beginning to affect Louisiana. There, New Orleans - devastated by Hurricane Katrina in 2005 - is preparing for flooding. Mayor Mitch Landrieu is urging residents to ""stay home"" and ""stay off the streets"". In Houston, forecasts suggest that some areas in and around the city could see up to 12in (30cm) of rain on Tuesday, bringing the total rainfall from Harvey to about 50in. Two dams outside the city appeared close to spilling over early on Tuesday, despite efforts to ease water levels there in the past day. At least nine people are reported to have died in the Houston area. Six members of the same family died trying to flee rising floodwaters,relatives told US media,external. The city's police chief has said he is worried about how many bodies will be found when the floods abate. The city - the fourth largest city in the US - did not order an evacuation amid concerns about 2.3 million fleeing residents leading to chaos and deaths on the roads, with the possibility of floodwaters trapping people in their vehicles. Thousands of people are reported to have been rescued by the authorities. Many have been spending the night at a huge shelter in central Houston. What is it like to be in Houston? Images of 'landmark' flooding Rescuers are trying to reach stranded people while the governor of Texas has approved the deployment of all 12,000 members of the state's National Guard to assist.

Harvey vs Katrina: Lessons learned? Viral photo prompts care home rescue US President Donald Trump will visit Texas - and possibly Louisiana - on Tuesday after declaring a federal state of emergency in both states, a move that triggers the release of emergency government funding and other assistance. He has warned that Texas faces a ""long and difficult road"" to recovery, adding: ""There's probably never been anything like this"". This image showing evacuations in east Houston has been widely shared on social media On Monday, the US Army Corps of Engineers began opening the Addicks and Barker dams outside Houston to ease the pressure. However,geological data,externalshows that at about 06:00 local time (11:00 GMT), the Addicks Dam was about two inches from spilling over. ""We are not 100% sure how that is going to work out,"" flood control official Jeff Lindnertold Houston's KHOU channel,externalearly on Tuesday. ""This has never happened before."" By 22:15 local time on Monday, the Barker damwas 3.5in from spilling over,external. While spillover would not cause the failure of either dam, it would add more water to the Buffalo Bayou, the main river in Houston. By James Cook, BBC North America correspondent, Houston All day in the suburbs to the west of Houston, hundreds of families waded cautiously along a road they usually take to the shops, to school and to work. It was an exhausting journey of well over a mile in waist-high flooding. All night, as water lapped into their homes, people had been calling for help, they said, but no-one came. Eventually a lone police officer arrived but by then people had taken matters into their own hands, forming a makeshift armada of little boats, jet skis, blow-up mattresses and even rubber rings. All day long they streamed out in the teeming rain. Occasionally someone would collapse and have to be helped up. Some children cried but most sat in shocked, soaking silence as they bobbed along on their inflatable rafts, teeth chattering in the cold. Wading through the water, Anthony Rogers, 54, summed up the mood. The authorities, he said, had been ""useless"".

"Laura Linkson says she felt unable to look after her children because of the pain caused by the implant A number of women are having to undergo hysterectomies to remove a sterilisation device used on the NHS, the Victoria Derbyshire show has found. The Essure implant is used to permanently sterilise women, but can cause side effects and complications. One woman - who later had her uterus removed - said she was left suicidal due to the ""unbearable"" pain, and felt she was a burden to her family. The manufacturer says Essure is safe and the benefits outweigh the risks. The sale of the implants in the EU was temporarily suspended this month. Manufacturer Bayer has asked hospitals in the UK not to use the device during this time. Laura Linkson, who was fitted with the Essure device in 2013, said the pain left her suicidal. ""The device was sold to me as a simple and easy procedure. I was told that I'd be in and out of the doctor's office in 10 minutes and that there'd be no recovery time. ""I went from being a mum who was doing everything with her children, to a mum that was stuck in bed unable to move without pain, at some points being suicidal. ""I felt like I was a burden on everyone around me,"" she added. The coil is inserted into the fallopian tubes The small coil implants, which are made of nickel and polyester (PET) fibres, are used as a sterilisation device to stop eggs reaching the womb. They are inserted into the fallopian tubes where they trigger inflammation, causing scar tissue to build up and eventually block the tubes, known as a hysteroscopic sterilisation. They can cause intense pain, and some women are thought to react badly to the nickel and plastic. Because of the way the coils attach to the fallopian tubes, the only way to take them out is to remove a woman's fallopian tubes and often her uterus. In other cases the device has been found to perforate a fallopian tube and fallen out, embedding itself elsewhere in the body. Victoria Dethier was implanted with Essure in 2012 and for three years could not work out why she felt so unwell. This video can not be played Victoria Dethier had a hysterectomy to remove the device ""There were moments where I couldn't get out of bed I was in so much pain. It felt like I was dying, like something was killing me from the inside,"" she said. She thinks her body was reacting to the PET fibres designed to cause inflammation. She had a hysterectomy to remove the device in 2015. ""Straight away there was a difference, I'd experienced a horrible taste in my mouth and that had gone,"" she explained. ""I'd lost a lot of hair and that came back within 12 months, it was incredible."" The medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency(MHRA),externalhas been criticised for not responding to the increasing evidence regarding the device. In 2015, a study published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) suggested that women who had a hysteroscopic sterilisation were 10 times more likely to need follow-up surgery than those who had a traditional sterilisation - 2.4% of those surveyed, as opposed to 0.2% amongst those having a standard sterilisation. In the US more than 15,000 women have reported problems to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), including pain, allergic reactions and ""migration of device"". Carl Heneghan, from the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine at Oxford University, has criticised the regulator's failure to act on such findings. ""How much evidence do you need to say let's withdraw this from the market?"" he asked. Victoria Dethier is angry that she and so many other women feel they have been ignored. ""No-one is listening to us,"" she said. ""There are many women coming forward... we need to be acknowledged."" The full extent of the problem in the UK is not known. The MHRA rejected the Victoria Derbyshire programme's Freedom of Information request asking how many women have reported problems. The NHS does not have figures for the total number of women who have been fitted with Essure, or who have had it removed. However, the clinical trial that led to the device being approved has been criticised for not considering the long-term effects of the implants. ""The trial... only followed up women for one year, so nobody has a real understanding of what happens with this device after two years, three years, five years,"" Mr Heneghan explained. Consultant obstetrician Ben Peyton-Jones says Essure implants can be safe when used correctly Some women who have experienced problems say they were not informed about the risks. But Ben Peyton-Jones, a consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist, said the device should still be used in some instances. ""I think it has a place for women who can't have keyhole surgery and who are explained the risks very carefully,"" he said. ""When used correctly, according to the manufacturer's guidance and in trained hands, it is safe."" The sale of Essure implants in the EU has now been suspended for further investigation. Hospitals have been asked by Bayer not to use their existing stocks during this time. It is a voluntary request and up to individual trusts to decide what to do. The company said that independent reviews of Essure had concluded that the benefits outweighed the risks. ""Patient safety and appropriate use of Essure are the greatest priorities for Bayer, and the company fully stands behind Essure as an appropriate choice for women who desire permanent contraception,"" it added in a statement. ""Many women with Essure rely on this form of contraception without any side effects."" The MHRA said it had no evidence to suggest this product was unsafe, and that the recent suspension did not suggest any increased risk to patient safety. It said it was important for healthcare professionals to discuss the risks with patients before a procedure.

"South Western Railway said there would be delays of at least 10 minutes Train delays at the UK's busiest railway station were expected to last until the end of the day following its reopening after engineering works. Ten of the platforms at London's Waterloo were shut for almost a month for an Â£800m project to boost capacity. The platforms came back into use on Tuesday but Network Rail testing then identified a signalling issue. One of the companies affected, South Western Railway, said there would be delays of at least 10 minutes. Buses were replacing trains on the Shepperton, Hampton Court and Chessington South branches and between Weybridge and Virginia Water. Compensation and other questions Some stations on routes to Waterloo were closed this morning and there were more problems caused by a broken-down freight train between Eastleigh and Southampton, while a broken-down train between Leatherhead and Effingham Junction in Surrey blocked lines. The first day of the upgrade project saw the platforms being demolished Ten Waterloo platforms were closed during the upgrade Network Rail said Waterloo had fully reopened following one of the ""largest and most complex"" upgrades in the station's history. A spokeswoman said a 1,000-strong team of engineers and trackside staff had been working 24 hours a day for the past three-and-a-half weeks to complete the work, which would boost capacity at the station by 30% by December 2018, providing space for another 45,000 passengers at morning and evening peaks. Becky Lumlock, route managing director at Network Rail, apologised to passengers for the delay and thanked them for their patience. She said: ""The work we have completed in three-and-a-half weeks this August will benefit passengers for decades to come. ""The longer platforms will create space for longer trains, making journeys more comfortable for passengers, particularly at the busiest times of day. ""Over the next 16 months, we'll turn our attention to the final stages of the redevelopment of the former international terminal."" The Â£800m station upgrade is to accommodate longer trains and provide space for 30% extra passengers Passengers have taken to social media to express their frustration at the problems: Allow Twitter content?

Jasper Johns said his journey from Kingston was delayed by up to 40 minutes. The 35-year-old said: ""There was an expectation or doubt that it would be ready, because they're pretty poor when they do these works anyway. ""But you've kind of had enough. Say 10 minutes more in the morning, then another 20 minutes perhaps in the evening, you take that over a week - it's an extra hour or so you spend commuting. Over three weeks. ""I've certainly felt more tired. I'm reasonably young and healthy, but my wife is seven months pregnant, and there's obviously older and younger people who commute as well, it's not as easy on them either."" Passengers were told in an email that services running across the whole South Western Railway network may be cancelled, delayed or revised. Anthony Smith, chief executive of the independent watchdog Transport Focus, said: ""Passengers will be disappointed that, after all the promises, communications and planning, the Waterloo upgrade slipped. Passengers booked tickets and made travel plans based on the promises made by the industry. ""Clearly the priority is to get things moving again: it is crucial that information is clear and plenty of staff are on hand to help. Then this must be reviewed to make sure the lessons of today are learnt and built into future events. ""In the meantime, every single passenger affected should claim compensation. Send a clear message to the industry and make sure your voice is heard."" Andy Mellors, managing director for South Western Railway, added: ""I'd like to thank our passengers for their patience over the past few weeks. ""It's clearly been a challenging time but these improvement works will help us deliver the increased capacity needed for the future.""

"Frankfurt is set to benefit from the UK's Brexit decision Viewed from the 38th floor of a newly-built skyscraper in the centre of the city, Frankfurt resembles a construction site. The gridiron streets that surround the now-iconic towers of Deutsche Bank, UBS and Commerzbank are eclipsed by layers of scaffolding. Meanwhile, giant orange cranes loom above the few green spaces that remain in the increasingly urbanised financial district. Despite its small size - it is home to under a million residents - and its unfair but unshakable reputation for being somewhat dull, Frankfurt is winning the battle for the spoils of Brexit Britain's economic heart; the City of London. Egged on by Germany's finance minister, Wolfgang Schaeuble, and enthusiastic emissaries from the state of Hesse, many of Europe's largest financial institutions have already announced their intention to relocate jobs here. German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble has been keen to promote Frankfurt as a financial centre Many banks' patience with the protracted Brexit negotiations, through which regulatory frameworks for foreign exchange trading and conditions for access to the Single Market must be thrashed out, seems to have run out. Morgan Stanley, Citigroup and Standard Chartered are among those who have chosen Frankfurt as their new European base, while others such as Goldman Sachs and UBS have promised to move thousands of jobs to the German hub. Predictions for the number of bankers set to descend on Frankfurt vary wildly, from tens of thousands, up to 100,000. Last week, a study by theWHU-Otto Beisheim management school,externalsuggested that the city could gain 10,000 new banking jobs and an extra 88,000 jobs in other sectors in Frankfurt and the surrounding Rhine-Main region. Some suggest Frankfurt and its region could gain up to 100,000 extra jobs There have also been reports speculating that the city is fast running out of office space. Quite the contrary, says Oliver Schwebel, the man in charge of Frankfurt Economic Development, a city-backed body tasked with enticing companies to the area. ""We have a plan for 20 new skyscrapers,"" he says, surveying the ever-changing skyline of the city locals dub ""Mainhattan"". There is approximately a million square metres of office space in Frankfurt available for immediate occupancy, he says, and an extra 250,000 sq m will be available in the next few years. That's almost triple the current level of demand. Careful not to seem triumphant, Mr Schwebel adds that while there has undoubtedly been a boost in real-estate investment in anticipation of an exodus from the City of London, ""these are all plans from the last 10 or 15 years, nothing to do with Brexit"". A pro-EU demonstration in Frankfurt earlier this year Elvin Durakovic, a partner at estate agents Knight Frank, also downplays the supposed Frankfurt surge. ""Last year, when Brexit was announced, I got calls: 'Elvin, are you partying? Elvin, are you happy everyone is coming to Frankfurt?'"", he recalls. ""But unfortunately, it is not really the fact."" Although ""10 or 11"" companies with offices in the city have called to say they are double-sizing, ""the truth is people are coming, looking around, but not making decisions."" Part of this, says Mr Durakovic, is down to a reluctance to abandon the cosmopolitan British capital - where many bankers have built comfortable lives. ""No one is aware of what will happen in one or two years, what will be the result of Brexit, what payments they will be forced to make if they stay in London,"" he explains. ""They feel very comfortable in London, but they have to be prepared."" Morgan Stanley, Citigroup and Standard Chartered are among those who have chosen Frankfurt as their new European base City and state officials balk at talk of a ""race"" for Brexit exiles; the somewhat undignified scramble for the business of the City of London is not in step with the self-assured image Frankfurt prefers to project. But representatives have nonetheless been employing the ""hard sell"". A recent video campaign produced by the German government as part of its bid for Frankfurt to host the European Banking Authority - filled with shots of millennials skating and surfboarding to a pulsating soundtrack - looks more like a chart-topping music video than a policy proposal. And as Mr Schwebel is keen to point out, Frankfurt has a lot going for it: its manageable size, its largely English-speaking population, its convenient air and rail connections, and its family-friendly suburbia. For bankers, its favourable time zone also allows for a ""never-ending day"": Asian markets can be serviced in the morning, the US in the evenings. Frankfurt is already Germany's financial capital and most banks have offices here Then there is the price. ""Here we are talking about 38.50 euros (Â£35) a square metre a month,"" says Knight Frank's Elvin Durakovic, referring to the cost of office space. ""In London it is approximately double"". Yet Frankfurt's pole position in the post-Brexit contest is largely down to pure convenience - most banks are already in the city, all they need to do is expand. They won't be doing so without some local consternation. Rolf Janssen, a veteran of the local Mieterschutzverein, a tenant's rights agency representing some 20,000 renters in the Frankfurt area, is concerned that the city - already one of the costliest in Germany - will become even more expensive for those not on the high salaries that are common in the financial services industry. Half of Frankfurt's inhabitants earn an average of 2,000 euros a month, while rent for a modest flat can be around 1,200 or 1,300, he explains. ""Thousands of people will come who have a lot of money,"" he says of the anticipated post-Brexit influx. ""This is a very difficult situation. It used to be difficult for students or temp workers [to afford rent], but now it's a problem for regular employees, and the middle class."" Crucially, higher rents affect the Mietspiegel, or rental index, which is compiled by calculating average property prices for the previous four years, and used to regulate the rental market. Despite Brexit, many bankers are reluctant to leave London Nonetheless, Mr Janssen is keen to point out that he's not suggesting UK workers be prevented from coming to the German financial capital. ""It is very important that so many British bankers are coming to Frankfurt,"" he says. ""We don't live in the middle ages, so we can't say this is a castle and we keep the drawbridge up."" Instead, the Mieterschutzverein wants to see more investment in affordable public housing - an issue that is already a talking point in the upcoming federal elections. For city administrators, meanwhile, the lack of clarity on numbers is proving to be a planning headache. ""If 10,000 people show up in one year do we have space? Absolutely not,"" says Paul Fochtman, the head of Frankfurt International School, which educates many of the children of those who work in the city's skyscrapers. The institution is bracing for a surge in pupils, but determining the capacity required is an impossible task. ""We ask 'how many are you bringing' and [the banks] say 'we can't tell you that yet',"" says Mr Fochtman, betraying some frustration. ""They are certainly coming - no question,"" he adds. ""But how many and how quickly, that remains elusive"".

"The majority of people mis-sold payment protection insurance may not yet have made a claim - and they are being urged to do so by Arnold Schwarzenegger. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has set a deadline of 29 August, 2019, for the final PPI claims to be made. A major advertising campaign by the FCA features a model head and voice of Arnie - urging people to act now. So far, Â£27bn has been paid out in compensation with major banks having set aside more than Â£37bn. PPI was supposed to cover repayments of loans if policyholders fell ill or lost their job. Millions of people who did not want or need PPI, or could have never made a claim, were mis-sold PPI primarily between 1990 and 2010. The subsequent compensation scheme has revealed it to be the UK's biggest financial mis-selling scandal. The new advert, in cinemas and on television from Tuesday, features an animatronic model of Schwarzenegger's head. In the voiceover, the actor and former governor of California, urges people to ""make a decision"" over PPI claims and to ""do it now!"". There are also billboards in a similar style. Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the FCA, said: ""Our campaign aims to cut through the noise on PPI. We want to encourage people to decide whether to find out if they had PPI and whether to complain or not."" The Â£42m awareness campaign, which includes a dedicated call centre for PPI queries, is being paid for by the 18 banks, building societies and credit card providers which sold the most PPI. Eddie Harrison, from Glasgow, was a freelancer and so did not need the insurance, but was told he could not have had a credit card without it. He said his pursuit of compensation took three years. ""The first offer that they gave me was Â£2.86, but the actual amount that they ended up paying me was a four-figure sum,"" he said. ""I had an account with this bank from when I was a little kid. ""I had my home insurance with them. I had my mortgage with them. I had pretty much everything with them. ""Obviously I don't have that anymore because there is a distrust between me and the bank I was with."" He said that only after writing letters, making phone calls and taking his case to the financial ombudsman did he finally have a satisfactory result. ""At the end of the day, there were thousands of pounds that were wrongly taken from my account that were eventually put back in again. ""I will never know if it was the full amount, but it was thousands of pounds that belonged to me that were returned under duress, so I would do it all again and certainly recommend to anyone else to do it,"" he said. More information on PPI and how you can claim is available on theFCA website,external. A free phone line, managed by the FCA, can be called on 0800 101 8800. Various templates are also available to download, along with guidance on claiming, on websites such asWhich?,external,MoneySavingExpert,external, andResolver,external. Cliff D'Arcy worked in a bank's PPI department for 11 years and said that sales were incredibly lucrative for the industry. Now, as a freelance financial journalist, he believes that there has been a degree of underestimation in the figures and that many fair claims for compensation were dismissed. The regulator, the FCA, said that many people may still be unaware that they ever had PPI and anyone who had a loan should check any paperwork they still had. Many banks no longer have paperwork for loans and cards from that time. A dedicated call centre will be set up as part of the FCA's multi-million pound campaign unveiled later. A spokeswoman for UK Finance, which represents the major banks, said: ""We fully support the introduction of the FCA's PPI mis-selling deadline. ""The regulator's deadline for PPI complaints provides additional clarity for consumers, with the accompanying awareness campaign intended to prompt action and help ensure that customers who deserve compensation receive it."" Consumer groups, such as Which?, say that now a deadline has been set, banks should do more to make it easier for people to make a claim, which can be done for free. These groups are concerned that consumers will go to claims management companies - businesses that offer to do the paperwork but take a cut of up to a third of any payout. Resolver, a website that offers free advice to consumers on how to complain, said that more than 80% of the PPI complaints made to the financial ombudsman last year were made by claims managers, and that there are 1,388 claims managers registered in the UK. It is likely that the two-year deadline will lead to a wave of text messages and calls from firms selling leads to these companies. But Nick Baxter, chairman of the Professional Financial Claims Association, the trade body for claims companies, said its members kept to a code of conduct which controlled the amount of time people could be contacted after ticking a box to accept marketing calls. He added that their fees were transparent and justified and that many people would not have received a payout at all, had they not used these services. These companies, consumer groups, and the regulator are also raising awareness of a Supreme Court case, known as the Plevin case, which means 2.4 million rejected compensation claims may now be able to make a fresh appeal. The ruling dealt with the case of a financial company's client not being made aware of a commission being paid when they were sold PPI. The court agreed that the company's failure to tell its client that it was receiving a large commission for the sale was unfair. Now the FCA has ruled that banks should have declared its commission if it was over 50%. If they did not declare it, then the customer is entitled to the return of any commission over 50%, plus interest, even if the PPI was not mis-sold.

"Naji Salim Hussain Al-Ali died a month after he was shot in the neck The murder of a Palestinian cartoonist who was shot dead is being reinvestigated 30 years on. Naji Salim Hussain Al-Ali, a political cartoonist for Kuwaiti newspaper Al-Qabas, was shot in the neck as he walked to his office in west London. He was taken to hospital after the attack on 22 July 1987 in Ives Street, Knightsbridge, but died a month later. The Met's Counter Terrorism Command wants information about the gunman and a man seen driving from the scene. Mr Al-Ali's satirical cartoons were sometimes seen as critical of the Palestinian regime and he had received a number of death threats in the years leading up to his murder, police said. Witness: The Murder of Naji al-Ali At the time of his death, Middle Eastern commentators maintained he had been killed as part of a Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) campaign to silence its critics in Europe and the Middle East, but the PLO denied this. His son Khalid Al-Ali said: ""Obviously many people were unhappy with his cartoons throughout his career: that could range from, obviously Israel as the enemy, and Arab leaders and Arab governments, including Palestinian leadership. ""There were always threats, there were always problems with his cartoons but this did not stop him from actually drawing."" A Palestinian student arrested in Hull during the inquiry was later jailed for possessing weapons and explosives. He claimed to have been working for both the PLO and the Israeli secret service, Mossad. An artist's impression of the suspected gunman as he may look today In the moments before his murder - for which no-one has ever been convicted - Mr Al-Ali had parked his car on Ixworth Place, before walking down Draycott Avenue and into Ives Street. Witnesses reported seeing him being followed by the gunman, who shot him from behind. They described him as being of Middle-Eastern appearance, aged about 25, with collar-length thick black hair that was wavy at the back. He was wearing a stonewashed denim jacket and dark trousers. After the attack, the gunman was seen running out of Ives Street, back across Draycott Avenue and into Ixworth Place. Prior to his murder, Naji Al-Ali published over 40,000 political cartoons in Arab newspapers, where his vitriolic satire took aim at Israel and the Palestine Liberation Movement, as well as Arab and Western countries. He made many enemies along the way. His most iconic character is Handala, a refugee child who is always shown with his back turned to the reader ""in protest of the world's complicity in the occupation of Palestine"". Mr Al-Ali's personal connection to Handala is well documented. He said: ""Handala was born 10 years old, and he will always be 10 years old. At that age, I left my homeland. When he returns, Handala will still be 10. And then he will start growing up."" A witness described seeing another man crossing Fulham Road into Lucan Place and getting into the driver's seat of a silver-grey, left-hand drive Mercedes shortly after the incident. The Met said he had been reportedly running with his left hand inside the right side of his jacket, as if he was concealing something. He was described as being of Middle-Eastern appearance, aged in his 50s, about 5ft 9in and of medium build but with heavy shoulders. He had dark bushy hair with a lot of grey in it, a ""fattish"" face and a ""bigger than average nose"". He was clean-shaven and of smart appearance in a grey suit. The Mercedes was seen driving off along Lucan Place and left into Ixworth Place, towards the junction with Sloane Avenue. It is believed that the registration number of the car contained the letters P and H in the first part and may have ended 11L. Commander Dean Haydon, head of the Met's Counter Terrorism Command, said: ""The gunman was seen following Mr Al-Ali for about 40 seconds before he shot him. ""Despite the briefness of the attack, witnesses were able to give investigators a good description of the suspect. ""We believe that he may have arranged to meet the man seen driving the silver-grey Mercedes straight after the murder. We believe that this driver was seen hiding the weapon in his coat, intending to dispose of it."" The gun - a 7.62 Tokarev pistol - was found in open space on the Hallfield Estate in Paddington almost two years after the murder, on 22 April 1989. Cdr Haydon added: ""The brutal murder of Mr Al-Ali devastated his family and 30 years on they continue to feel the loss. ""A lot can change in 30 years - allegiances shift and people who were not willing to speak at the time of the murder may now be prepared to come forward with crucial information.""

"UK companies now have to reveal how much chief executives are paid, compared to other employees Prime Minister Theresa May has been accused by Labour and trade unions of ""watering down"" plans to tackle corporate excess. But Downing Street said Mrs May had been ""consistent"" in her approach. Under government reforms, the UK's biggest firms will have to reveal how much more their chief executives are paid compared with the average worker. Companies will also be encouraged to represent workers' voices on boards. Unions attacked the plans, saying they were ""feeble"", and Labour said the prime minister had backtracked on promises. However, a Downing Street spokeswoman said Mrs May ""wants to improve workers' representation and that's going to be achieved with part of this report, which is about changes to the corporate governance code."" ""From her perspective, her position has been consistent and has not changed,"" the spokeswoman added. The government has released measures aimed at increasing boardroom transparency in publicly listed companies. Business Secretary Greg Clark said the changes would make firms ""more accountable to their employees and shareholders"". The new corporate governance laws, which are due to come into effect by June 2018, will force some 900 publicly listed companies to reveal the pay ratio between bosses and workers. Reality Check: How big is the pay gap? Simon Jack: The great corporate climbdown May attacks 'unacceptable' executive pay Bosses of the UK's 100 biggest listed firms earned Â£4.5m on average last year, and typically took home 129 times more than the average employee at those firms. The Conservatives hadpromised in their manifestothat executive pay should be approved by an annual vote of shareholders. However, the new measures instead propose that those public companies who face a shareholder revolt on pay will be named on a register overseen by the Investment Association. BBC business editor Simon Jack said the government had watered down plans in the face of business lobbying, but also pragmatic and legal problems. At the weekend, Theresa May attacked firms who hand bosses excessive pay ""as the unacceptable face of capitalism"". Writing inthe Mail on Sunday,external, she said the excesses of some chief executives was ""damaging the social fabric of our country"". Businesses will also have to ensure that staff of listed companies are better represented at board level, either by allowing workers to nominate a director, creating an employee advisory council or assigning a non-executive director to represent the workforce. This requirement will be included in the UK Corporate Governance Code, which operates on a ""comply or explain"" basis. Business Secretary Greg Clark will unveil the government plans Mrs May had initially promised to force companies to have an employee representative on the board, during her bid to become Conservative Party leader last July. However, she backtracked in November and said businesses would not be mandated to implement the move. Labour accused the government of ""watering down"" an original promise to increase workers' voice to a lone representative on the board of directors or a separate employee advisory council. ""Each of these will be easily outvoted or ignored,"" said Rebecca Long-Bailey, Labour's shadow business secretary. TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said the government's reforms were ""feeble"". ""Just a year ago the prime minister repeatedly promised fundamental reform of business and that's because there was real public concern about boardroom greed, about tax avoidance and exploitative work practices,"" she told the BBC. ""I am afraid that the government has bottled it in the face of business lobbying and that doesn't bode well for really tackling some of these big problems,"" she added. Vince Cable, leader of the Liberal Democrats, said: ""The overblown rhetoric from Theresa May is completely at odds with the weakness of the new rules."" While the majority of the new measures will only apply to publicly-listed companies, the government has asked the Financial Reporting Council, the City watchdog, to draw up a voluntary set of corporate governance principles for large private companies. It follows the collapse of BHS last year which left 11,000 people out of a job and the company's pension schemes in a perilous state. The department store chain was sold by Sir Philip Green to a former bankrupt, Dominic Chappell, for Â£1 in 2015. Commenting of the corporate governance reforms, Paul Drechsler, president of the CBI business lobby group, said: ""Companies take this seriously and look forward to working closely with the government to ensure the UK maintains its reputation as a global leader in this field and as a primary location for international investment. ""The CBI is very clear that the unacceptable behaviour of a few firms does not reflect the high standards and responsible behaviour of the vast majority of companies."" It is no surprise that today's package of reforms to the way Britain's companies are run has fallen short of the crackdown on fat cat behaviour promised by Theresa May last year. The watering-down can has been used liberally since she initially promised workers on boards and binding shareholder votes on executive pay. The size of the climbdown is arguably as much to do with the scale of the original ambition as with the feebleness of the final proposals. The Tory attempt to shake up the way corporate Britain is run hit several obstacles. Lobbying by the business community was to be expected, but there are some pragmatic and legal problems as well.
