"At White House briefing, President Trump welcomed Boris Johnson's move from intensive care EU finance ministers agreed a â¬500bn (Â£440bn) rescue package for hard-hit European countries Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab says it is ""too early"" to lift restrictions Confirmed coronavirus cases around the world neared 1.6 million, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University A further 6.6 million people filed for unemployment benefits in the US The virus could push half a billion people into poverty, Oxfam warned Spain close to passing the worst of the coronavirus outbreak, government says Some European countries cautiously start to ease lockdown measures Jude Sheerin And with that we are going to pause our live coverage for the day. Thank you for joining us - and our teams in Asia will be starting up a new report for Friday soon. Here's a roundup of the day's biggest stories.   First Lady Melania Trump took to Twitter on Thursday to promote the use of face masks as a way to curb the spread of the coronavirus. ""As the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] continues to study the spread of Covid-19, they're recommending that people wear cloth face coverings in public setting where social distancing measures can be difficult to maintain,"" she said in a video. ""Remember, this does not replace the importance of social distancing,"" she says. First announcing the new CDC guidance last week, President Trump said he would opt out of the voluntary advice. ""You do not have to do it,"" he said. ""I don't think I'm going to be doing it."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Dr Fauci, the face of the US coronavirus response, says that while the death toll continues to climb, there's proof that social distancing measures are having a positive effect in the US. ""Every day seems to be a record"" in terms of death toll, Dr Fauci says. But we're seeing a ""dramatic decrease in the need for hospitalisation"". ""That means what we're doing is working, and therefore we need to continue"", he says. Earlier on Thursday, Dr Fauci revised an earlier model predicting 100,000 to 200,000 American deaths as a result of the virus outbreak, saying it ""looks more like 60,000"". After speaking for just over 20 minutes, Trump leaves the White House briefing room, turning the podium over to Vice-President Mike Pence. Pence says the US is now testing 100,000 Americans each day and that the administration is ""working around the clock to increase that number"". ""We continue to see signs of stabilisation, we are close to the peak,"" Pence says. The vice-president also says that the hospital ship deployed to New York, the USNS Comfort, and the Javits Center, recently converted to help with hospital overflow, are not being fully used. Physicians and military personnel are now being deployed to other hospitals across New York City to relieve pressure, Pence says. ""There are signs of progress and hope abounds,"" he says. ""It's working, America.""  Trump says that drug company Pfizer has found a ""promising new treatment"" that might prevent the virus from replicating. Clinical trials for the treatment are to begin ""very soon"". ""They have great feelings for this particular therapy,"" Trump says, adding that 19 therapies or treatments are currently being tested by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Trump says that 2 million tests are being carried out in the US, before repeating his claim that the US has ""the best testing system in the world"". Asking if the US needed more widespread testing before re-opening the economy, Trump demurred, saying it was not possible to test the entire US population. ""Do you need it? No. Is it a nice thing to do? Yes,"" he said. ""We're talking about 325 million people and that's not going to happen, as you can imagine."" The US has ramped up testing in recent weeks - although its number of tests per capita still lags behind that of South Korea.  Trump tells Americans he is pleased that UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been moved out of intensive care. ""That's a tremendous statement,"" he says. ""And we continue to pray for him and his fast recovery."" Johnson has been moved out of intensive care but remains in hospital. His spokesman said he was in ""extremely good spirits"". The White House announced earlier today that everyone in the room for Trump's daily briefing will be given a test for Covid-19 - with results generated within minutes. Earlier this week, Trump touted these new, rapid testing kits as a potential game-changer for hospitals. ""It's a five-minute test so people can get their results back very quickly,"" he said. Some rapid tests work by finding fragments of genetic material from the coronavirus to find a current infection. In practical terms, this means a healthcare worker can use a swab to take a sample from a patient's nose or throat. This sample is magnified and replicated in a toaster-sized machine to see if the virus is present. Another type of rapid testing is also in development: an antibody test. These blood tests can reveal whether someone had Covid-19 in the past, even after that person has recovered. A positive test result shows that a person has previously been exposed to the virus, and developed the antibodies to fight it. Top US health expert Dr Anthony Fauci said on Thursday that antibody tests would become available to Americans ""very soon"".  Different types of rapid-fire tests are being developed throughout the US President Donald Trump has taken the stage with the White House coronavirus task force to begin their daily briefing.

The UK lockdown has meant the closure of barber shops, leaving many struggling with the choice of ""going DIY"" or just letting nature take its course.

South African President Cyril Ramaphosa and ministers will take a pay cut of a third for the next three months as the country battles with the coronavirus outbreak. The senior politicians will donate the money to help those worst affected by the pandemic, the president said, urging business leaders to do the same. He also announced that the country is to extend its nationwide lockdown until the end of April. âUnless we hold to this course for a little longer, the coronavirus pandemic will engulf, and ultimately consume, our country,â he said in a live address to the nation. Britain's tourist hotspots have all pleaded with people not to visit them for the Easter weekend. People in the UK are only meant to travel for essential reasons. Judy Pearce, the council leader of South Hams in Devon, told the BBC: ""Normally we love seeing people but not this year. What is there not to understand? ""It is not necessary travel to come to your second home. Devon and Cornwall have done well to keep the virus out largely, but people will bring it."" Police have been stopping cars with more than one person from driving into Cumbria and the Lake District - and ordering them to do a U-turn and go home if they do not have a legitimate reason for travel. And a roadblock has been set up on one of the main routes to the coast in west Wales. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

EU finance ministers have agreed a â¬500bn (Â£440bn) rescue package for European countries hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic. The chairman of the Eurogroup, Mario Centeno, announced the deal, reached after marathon discussions in Brussels. The French Finance Minister, Bruno Le Maire, hailed the agreement as the most important economic plan in EU history. The package includes support for governments via the European Stability Mechanism, support for companies through the European Investment Bank and support for workers via the European Commissionâs new programme known as Sure. However the ministers fell short of accepting a demand, by France, Spain and Italy, to share out the cost of the crisis by issuing so-called corona bonds. Earlier, German Chancellor Angela Merkel rejected that idea of mutual debt, stating that she didnât believe there should be a âcommon liability for each otherâs debt, given the current state of the political union in the EUâ. US President Donald Trump will soon take to the podium for his daily update on Covid-19. The White House announced today that everyone in the room for the daily briefing will be given a rapid Covid-19 test, with results expected before the start of the briefing. The US has more than 452,500 confirmed cases to date with more than 16,000 deaths. Food banks across Canada and the US are buckling under the weight of surging demand, just as social-distancing orders have cut down on both donations and volunteers. Believe it or not, a movie has already been made about coronavirus. ""Corona: Fear is a Virus"" - which will be available on streaming platforms later this month - is about seven people trapped in a lift and the chaos that ensues when one of them starts to cough. Director Mostafa Keshvari started the film after the outbreak in China but before it became a global pandemic. Film critic Noah Gittell says it might be too soon for people to process the trauma but adds there is nothing unethical about releasing a coronavirus film now. This video can not be played Coronavirus: Is it too soon for a movie about it? There is no lockdown in place in Sweden Sweden is one of the few European countries to avoid a full
lockdown. While social distancing is in place, schools remain open across the
country, as do bars and restaurants. You can read more about ithere. That approach has come in for some criticism, at home and
abroad. On Thursday the assistant director of Norwayâs Directorate of Health, Espen
Rostrup Nakstad, said the Swedish plan was âcompletely wrongâ. He told newspaper VG that countries that initially adopted a âbraking strategyâ would have to quickly switch to
stronger measures to contain any spread. But Anders Tegnell, the chief epidemiologist at Swedenâs
Public Health Agency, has defended his countryâs efforts. âNorway chose the general strategy of closing as much as
possibleâ¦ to gain some respite,â he told Norwayâs public broadcaster NRK. âWe are trying to do the same, but have accepted that
closing the community is not the solution.â As of Thursday, Sweden has reported 793 dead in total â
rising from 687 on Wednesday â with over 9,000 confirmed cases in all. Norway
has reported 88 deaths and 6,160 confirmed cases. UK Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick has defended visiting his parents during the coronavirus lockdown -as reported in The Guardian.,external In a tweet he said: ""For clarity - my parents asked me to deliver some essentials - including medicines. ""They are both self-isolating due to age and my father's medical condition and I respected social distancing rules.""

The number of confirmed infections in Germany rose by 4,974 in the past 24 hours to 108,202, climbing for the third straight day after four previous days of drops. There have been 2,107 deaths. Merkel said: ""I can say that the latest numbers on the spread of the virus give reason for cautious hope. ""The curve is flattening slightly. And the number of those infected is going slightly down. We can be very happy about that."" Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,0.99999905
"Three-quarters of the world's workers have seen their place of work close at least partially during the pandemic, the UN says The coronavirus pandemic will turn global economic growth ""sharply negative"" this year, the head of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned. Kristalina Georgieva said the world faced the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression of the 1930s. She forecast that 2021 would only see a partial recovery. Lockdowns imposed by governments have forced many companies to close and lay off staff. Earlier this week, a UN study said 81% of the world's workforce of 3.3 billion people had had their place of work fully or partly closed because of the outbreak. Four out of five jobs affected by virus globally Coronavirus: A visual guide to the economic impact Global economy will suffer for 'years to come' Ms Georgieva, the IMF's managing director, made her bleak assessment in remarks ahead of next week's IMF and World Bank Spring Meetings. Emerging markets and developing countries would be the hardest hit, she said, requiring hundreds of billions of dollars in foreign aid. ""Just three months ago, we expected positive per capita income growth in over 160 of our member countries in 2020,"" she said. ""Today, that number has been turned on its head: we now project that over 170 countries will experience negative per capita income growth this year.""

STRESS:How to protect your mental health VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak Ms Georgieva said that if the pandemic eased in the second half of 2020, the IMF expected to see a partial recovery next year. But she cautioned that the situation could also worsen. ""I stress there is tremendous uncertainty about the outlook. It could get worse depending on many variable factors, including the duration of the pandemic,"" she said.

The US Federal Reserve said it would unleash an additional $2.3tn in lending as restrictions on activity to help contain the coronavirus had forced many businesses to close and put about 95% of Americans on some form of lockdown. Separately, UK-based charity organisation Oxfam warned thatthe economic fallout from the spread of Covid-19could force more than half a billion more people into poverty. By the time the pandemic is over, the charity said, half of the world's population of 7.8 billion people could be living in poverty. 2021 would only see a partial recovery, Ms Georgieva said On Thursday, following marathon talks, EU leaders agreed a â¬500bn (Â£440bn; $546bn) economic support package for members of the bloc hit hardest by the lockdown measures. The European Commission earlier said it aimed to co-ordinate a possible ""roadmap"" to move away from the restrictive measures. Earlier this week,the International Labour Organization (ILO), a UN agency, warnedthat the pandemic posed ""the most severe crisis"" since World War Two. It said the outbreak was expected to wipe out 6.7% of working hours across the world during the second quarter of 2020 - the equivalent of 195 million full-time workers losing their jobs. Last month,the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) warned that the global economy would take years to recover.

"Universities face uncertainty over student numbers during the coronavirus outbreak Universities across the UK are calling for emergency funding of at least Â£2bn, warning some institutions will go bust without it. Universities UK says the coronavirus pandemic is threatening to sharply cut overseas student numbers and put universities in financial danger. They are asking for controls on student numbers in each university, to keep fee income at similar levels to last year. Universities are promising to honour any offers already made to students. ""Without government support, some universities would face financial failure, others would come close to financial failure and be forced to reduce provision,"" says a letter from higher education leaders to ministers across the UK. Alistair Jarvis, chief executive of Universities UK, says the proposals would help universities to ""weather the very serious financial challenges posed by Covid-19"". University numbers could face emergency controls Students angry at being charged rent when not in rooms next term Universities told to stop unconditional offers in coronavirus confusion He says academic researchers have made a ""huge contribution"" to tackling the coronavirus pandemic - and their expertise will be needed in the ""recovery of the economy and communities following the crisis"".Â They are calling for an extra Â£2bn in research funding and on top of that to provide emergency loans for universities that faced ""significant income losses"". ""Targeted support"" should be available to protect strategically important subjects such as science and medicine, say the industry leaders. This would be in response to cash pressures from the pandemic: Universities receive almost Â£7bn in fees from overseas students - and there are fears that their numbers could be much reduced this autumn The university sector says it has already lost Â£790m in cancelled business activities, such as conferences, catering and student accommodation There is also uncertainty about whether campuses will be able to re-open in the autumn and whether many UK students will defer entry this year There have been warnings of unprecedented ""volatility"" in this year's admissions - which, if left unchecked, could see some universities expanding but others left with too few students to be financially viable. This is a particular risk for universities in England and Wales, which are highly dependent on tuition fee income. Universities are calling for controls on the number of students each institution can recruit this year In response, Universities UK is asking for controls on the number of students each university in England and Wales can recruit this year, keeping them to levels expected before the coronavirus outbreak, to stop financially unsustainable swings in numbers. The scale of concern was suggested in an internal email from a Russell Group university seen by the BBC this week, which warned the university could lose a quarter of its income next year. The letter from Universities UK to ministers says that to provide ""stability"" for students currently applying, all offers already made would have to be honoured if students made the required grade. There is also a call to push back by a year the point at which European Union students are categorised as overseas students, when they will face higher fees and visa restrictions. Jo Grady of the UCU lecturers' union said the plan was a ""piecemeal approach that fails to recognise the size of the problem, or the damage we risk doing to our academic capacity"". Eva Crossan Jory, vice president of the National Union of Students, said any extra funding must support students, ""especially considering the mounting discontent that courses are not being delivered as promised and demands for refunds"". She backed calls for the government to ""step in"" to protect higher education, but said it should include ""refunding or all or part of the fees"". ""The scale of the financial challenges facing higher education institutions are clearly very serious"", said Scotland's Deputy First Minister John Swinney. He promised to work closely with universities to help them ""emerge from this crisis"". A Welsh government spokesman said universities had been ""at the forefront of the battle against the coronavirus"" and ministers would work to ensure they had the ""necessary investment"". In England, a Department for Education spokeswoman said: ""The outbreak poses significant challenges to the sector and the government is working closely with universities to understand the financial risks and implications they might face at this uncertain time.""

"Italy has been struggling with huge debt since before the coronavirus crisis EU finance ministers have agreed a â¬500bn (Â£430bn;$540bn) rescue package for European countries hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic. The chairman of the Eurogroup, MÃ¡rio Centeno, announced the deal, reached after marathon discussions in Brussels. It comes as Spain's prime minister said the country was close to passing the worst of its coronavirus outbreak. Spain has Europe's highest number of confirmed cases, with 152,446. More than 15,000 people have died. The head of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned the world is facing the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression of the 1930s. Kristalina Georgieva said the coronavirus pandemic wouldturn economic growth ""sharply negative"" this year. Coronavirus: A visual guide to the economic impact Can EU get a grip on coronavirus? At their Brussels talks, EU ministers failed to accept a demand from France and Italy to share out the cost of the crisis by issuing so-called coronabonds. The package finally agreed is smaller than the European Central Bank (ECB) had urged. The ECB has said the bloc may need up to â¬1.5tn (Â£1.3tn) to tackle the crisis. However, the French Finance Minister, Bruno Le Maire, hailed the agreement as the most important economic plan in EU history. ""Europe has decided and is ready to meet the gravity of the crisis,"" he tweeted after the talks. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash The main component of the rescue plan involves the European Stability Mechanism, the EU's bailout fund, which will make â¬240bn available to guarantee spending by indebted countries under pressure. The EU ministers also agreed other measures including â¬200bn in guarantees from the European Investment Bank and a European Commission project for national short-time working schemes. Ministers were close to a deal on Wednesday, but the talks broke down and had to be resumed a day later, amid a dispute between Italy and the Netherlands over how to apply the recovery fund. ""Our faith in Europe has proven correct!"" tweeted the Italian president of the European Parliament, David Sassoli triumphantly, as soon as EU finance ministers announced the deal. So is he right: is everything hunky-dory now in the EU? The dark mutterings of deep divisions banished? Not really. The EU is stumbling through this crisis as it has done through the migration and the financial crises before, for instance. The bloc is not about to disintegrate but scars will remain in countries that felt the chilly absence of EU solidarity in their hour of coronavirus need. ""This has not been our finest moment,"" a diplomat from an influential EU country told me. ""Our response has come late and has been marred by nationalism. Solidarity went out the window with the first coronavirus victim."" Read more from Katya Adler The coronavirus pandemic has exposed deep divisions in Europe, where Italy and Spain have accused northern nations - led by Germany and the Netherlands - of not doing enough. This video can not be played Italian PM Giuseppe Conte told the BBC in April how the lockdown could be eased Speaking before the agreement, Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte told the BBC that the EU needs to rise to the challenge of what he calls ""the biggest test since the Second World War."" The infection rate is slowing in Italy. Latest figures show positive cases increasing from the previous day by a little over 1%. Two weeks ago, the rise was 7%. The death rate is also falling. Spain's Prime Minister Pedro SÃ¡nchez also saidthe situation there was improving. He told MPs in Madrid on Thursday: ""The fire starts to come under control."" He vowed that the country would have ""total victory"" over the virus. According to latest data from the past 24 hours, Spain has recorded 683 deaths - a drop from the 757 reported on Wednesday. In recent days, leaders have begun to sound more positive. Small, non-essential shops are set to open in Austria and Czech Republic next week. Denmark's schools and kindergartens will reopen on 15 April, and Norway's on 20 April. Even Italy is considering when some lockdown measures could gradually be relaxed. Mr Conte said: ""If scientists confirm it, we might be able to relax some measures already by the end of this month."" However Spain extended its state of emergency on Thursday until 26 April, keeping people at home for a further two weeks. There are also widespread concerns about the Easter weekend, when people usually travel to see loved ones. Portugal has tightened lockdown measures for Easter, with a ban on people leaving their local area without official documentation.

"Italy has been struggling with huge debt since before the coronavirus crisis EU finance ministers have agreed a â¬500bn (Â£430bn;$540bn) rescue package for European countries hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic. The chairman of the Eurogroup, MÃ¡rio Centeno, announced the deal, reached after marathon discussions in Brussels. It comes as Spain's prime minister said the country was close to passing the worst of its coronavirus outbreak. Spain has Europe's highest number of confirmed cases, with 152,446. More than 15,000 people have died. The head of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned the world is facing the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression of the 1930s. Kristalina Georgieva said the coronavirus pandemic wouldturn economic growth ""sharply negative"" this year. Coronavirus: A visual guide to the economic impact Can EU get a grip on coronavirus? At their Brussels talks, EU ministers failed to accept a demand from France and Italy to share out the cost of the crisis by issuing so-called coronabonds. The package finally agreed is smaller than the European Central Bank (ECB) had urged. The ECB has said the bloc may need up to â¬1.5tn (Â£1.3tn) to tackle the crisis. However, the French Finance Minister, Bruno Le Maire, hailed the agreement as the most important economic plan in EU history. ""Europe has decided and is ready to meet the gravity of the crisis,"" he tweeted after the talks. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash The main component of the rescue plan involves the European Stability Mechanism, the EU's bailout fund, which will make â¬240bn available to guarantee spending by indebted countries under pressure. The EU ministers also agreed other measures including â¬200bn in guarantees from the European Investment Bank and a European Commission project for national short-time working schemes. Ministers were close to a deal on Wednesday, but the talks broke down and had to be resumed a day later, amid a dispute between Italy and the Netherlands over how to apply the recovery fund. ""Our faith in Europe has proven correct!"" tweeted the Italian president of the European Parliament, David Sassoli triumphantly, as soon as EU finance ministers announced the deal. So is he right: is everything hunky-dory now in the EU? The dark mutterings of deep divisions banished? Not really. The EU is stumbling through this crisis as it has done through the migration and the financial crises before, for instance. The bloc is not about to disintegrate but scars will remain in countries that felt the chilly absence of EU solidarity in their hour of coronavirus need. ""This has not been our finest moment,"" a diplomat from an influential EU country told me. ""Our response has come late and has been marred by nationalism. Solidarity went out the window with the first coronavirus victim."" Read more from Katya Adler The coronavirus pandemic has exposed deep divisions in Europe, where Italy and Spain have accused northern nations - led by Germany and the Netherlands - of not doing enough. This video can not be played Italian PM Giuseppe Conte told the BBC in April how the lockdown could be eased Speaking before the agreement, Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte told the BBC that the EU needs to rise to the challenge of what he calls ""the biggest test since the Second World War."" The infection rate is slowing in Italy. Latest figures show positive cases increasing from the previous day by a little over 1%. Two weeks ago, the rise was 7%. The death rate is also falling. Spain's Prime Minister Pedro SÃ¡nchez also saidthe situation there was improving. He told MPs in Madrid on Thursday: ""The fire starts to come under control."" He vowed that the country would have ""total victory"" over the virus. According to latest data from the past 24 hours, Spain has recorded 683 deaths - a drop from the 757 reported on Wednesday. In recent days, leaders have begun to sound more positive. Small, non-essential shops are set to open in Austria and Czech Republic next week. Denmark's schools and kindergartens will reopen on 15 April, and Norway's on 20 April. Even Italy is considering when some lockdown measures could gradually be relaxed. Mr Conte said: ""If scientists confirm it, we might be able to relax some measures already by the end of this month."" However Spain extended its state of emergency on Thursday until 26 April, keeping people at home for a further two weeks. There are also widespread concerns about the Easter weekend, when people usually travel to see loved ones. Portugal has tightened lockdown measures for Easter, with a ban on people leaving their local area without official documentation.

"The UK economy is forecast to fall an incredible amount in the current pandemic-afflicted quarter ending in June. The forecast comes from the projections of more than a dozen top economists, who are surveyed every month by the Treasury, and were contacted by the BBC. While the same economists predict a similarly large positive rebound after that, this year, annual UK GDP is still anticipated to fall significantly. While there is no precedent for shutdowns of large swathes of the economy, 14 of the top economists from the City and business have calculated how much economic activity is being lost. The estimates have an average of -14%. However they range from JP Morgan's calculation that UK GDP in the April-June quarter will come in at -7.5% - a sharp contraction - to Capital Economics' forecast of -24% - suggesting nearly a quarter of entire economic activity will be lost. Half the forecasts seen by the BBC are between -13% and -15%. Quarterly figures normally move by fractions of a percent. US jobless claims surge for third week Government agrees emergency funding deal with Bank Virus could push half a billion people into poverty For reference, just a few weeks ago, before the pandemic hit the UK, the average forecast for this quarter was a fall of just 0.2%. The official Budget forecast a month ago, before the Coronavirus effects, pencilled in growth of 0.4%. The BBC understands that analyses circulating in the Treasury are in line with the larger end of such declines. But the Office of Budget Responsibility (OBR) has not yet been asked to update projections from the time of the Budget a month ago. One OBR member, Sir Charles Bean, has referred to it being ""not implausible"" that for as long as the lockdowns are in force, economic activity will be reduced ""by somewhere between a quarter and a third"", and that a three-month lockdown ""would knock something like 6-8 percentage points off annual GDP"". Last week, the OECD group of leading economies said that the immediate hit to the UK economy would be worth 26% of the economy. But it did not put a timeframe on that. The Bank of England is currently preparing new forecasts for its Monetary Policy Report, to be published early next month. Last month, Bank governor Andrew Bailey said he could not put a precise number on the likely GDP fall, as it depends on how Covid-19 evolves. But ""every picture we look on at has a very sharp V on it"", he said. Bosses of businesses offering services, like barbers and hairdressers, say they have no idea when cash will start rolling in again Such movements have no precedent within a single quarter. The closest comparison would be the sharp fall in the economy during the early 1920s depression, although that occurred over three economic quarters. A prolonged fall such as seen a century ago is not what forecasters are predicting right now. These sorts of numbers are anticipated across the developed world, as most nations pursue forms of shutdown to control the spread of the virus and protect health systems from being overwhelmed. The forecast declines illustrate the difficult balancing act for the government in deciding when and how to lift lockdowns, now not expected until May at the earliest. They also illustrate the fundamental economic policy challenge that the Treasury and Bank of England are trying to manage - to try to help ensure that there is a sharp rebound from these huge hits, avoiding prolonged damage to the economy. > US jobless claims surge for third week Government agrees emergency funding deal with Bank Virus could push half a billion people into poverty Locals find homes reduced to ash as fears grow of more fierce winds spreading LA fires Climate 'whiplash' linked to raging LA fires Watch: The moment five US presidents gather at Jimmy Carter's funeral The '9/11 mastermind' is set to plead guilty.

"Anneliese Dodds is the new shadow chancellor The last thing UK business needs in the current economic climate is a ""chaotic exit"" from EU trading rules, Labour's new shadow chancellor has warned. Anneliese Dodds urged ministers not to put ""ideology over national interest"". The UK has left the EU but has given itself until 31 December to negotiate a trade deal, until which time most EU rules will still apply. New Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has said it was ""a mistake"" to put that date into legislation. Downing Street has insisted the Brexit timetable remains unchanged. Ms Dodds, who served in her predecessor John McDonnell's shadow Treasury team, warned against the ""kind of chaotic exit that has always been a threat under this Conservative government"". She called for ""desperately needed"" co-operation with the EU and other international bodies on the coronavirus crisis. Ms Dodds, who represents the Oxford East constituency, was an MEP before entering the Westminster Parliament in 2017. 'Scrutiny is important' says new Labour leader - BBC News Ed Miliband returns to Labour top team Brexit trade talks continuing in âdifficult timesâ In an interview with the PA news agency, she said: ""Very sadly we've seen in areas like provision of protective equipment, testing capacity, ventilators and so forth, what happens when there isn't that co-ordination and when international systems aren't necessarily working in the way that they should be working."" She added: ""I think we've seen that ideological approach from government towards the EU in particular, so I really hope that that changes because we don't really have the luxury currently I think to be indulging in a partisan approach to these matters."" She backed Sir Keir Starmer's stance on Brexit, which saw the Labour Party fight the 2019 election on a promise to renegotiate a Brexit deal with Brussels and then put it to a referendum. ""Now clearly we didn't win the last general election, we have left the EU,"" she told PA. But the ""key questions"" were now about how jobs can be protected ""in a very difficult economic climate"", she added. The last thing UK business would want was ""a kind of chaotic approach to trade coming at the end of the year after this very, very difficult period that we're going through economically now,"" said Ms Dodds. The UK's chief Brexit negotiator, David Frost, has said he wanted to ""reassure everyone"" contacts were continuing between the UK and EU during the coronavirus outbreak. He added: ""We have remained in touch throughout, both sides have exchanged legal texts, and last week we had a series of conference calls to explore and clarify technicalities.""

"Home rental firm Airbnb is to temporarily restrict UK bookings to key workers and âessential staysâ because of the coronavirus crisis. The firm said that the measure would last until at least 18 April. Key workers - such as NHS and social care staff, and transport and food retail employees - can still book through a programme calledFrontline Stays,external. The decision comes after the government criticised opportunistic hosts. TheBBC had reported on Mondaythat some listings were letting customers use the âinstant bookâ function without requiring them to be vetted. At the time, some owners were describing their properties as being ""Covid-19 retreats"" and ""perfect for isolating with family"" on the site. Tourism Minister Nigel Huddleston described this as being ""irresponsible and dangerous"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

A BBC London investigation subsequently found hundreds of properties - some within shared accommodation - were being marketed in the capital to tourists for the coming Easter bank holiday weekend. Using a regular account, the BBC questioned some of the landlords to check the bookings were still available. ""Yes, it's a shared accommodation with me and my two daughters, you can have the room,"" one replied. Another said: ""You will have your private room but with shared bathroom. Toilet and shower is shared with seven other rooms on the same floor."" Neither property owner asked if the booking was for a key worker. Airbnb said it would take action in response to the findings. The Frontline Stays programme is designed to provide up to 100,000 healthcare staff and first-responders with accommodation close to their patients and a safe distance away from their own families.

"Italy has been struggling with huge debt since before the coronavirus crisis EU finance ministers have agreed a â¬500bn (Â£430bn;$540bn) rescue package for European countries hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic. The chairman of the Eurogroup, MÃ¡rio Centeno, announced the deal, reached after marathon discussions in Brussels. It comes as Spain's prime minister said the country was close to passing the worst of its coronavirus outbreak. Spain has Europe's highest number of confirmed cases, with 152,446. More than 15,000 people have died. The head of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned the world is facing the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression of the 1930s. Kristalina Georgieva said the coronavirus pandemic wouldturn economic growth ""sharply negative"" this year. Coronavirus: A visual guide to the economic impact Can EU get a grip on coronavirus? At their Brussels talks, EU ministers failed to accept a demand from France and Italy to share out the cost of the crisis by issuing so-called coronabonds. The package finally agreed is smaller than the European Central Bank (ECB) had urged. The ECB has said the bloc may need up to â¬1.5tn (Â£1.3tn) to tackle the crisis. However, the French Finance Minister, Bruno Le Maire, hailed the agreement as the most important economic plan in EU history. ""Europe has decided and is ready to meet the gravity of the crisis,"" he tweeted after the talks. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash The main component of the rescue plan involves the European Stability Mechanism, the EU's bailout fund, which will make â¬240bn available to guarantee spending by indebted countries under pressure. The EU ministers also agreed other measures including â¬200bn in guarantees from the European Investment Bank and a European Commission project for national short-time working schemes. Ministers were close to a deal on Wednesday, but the talks broke down and had to be resumed a day later, amid a dispute between Italy and the Netherlands over how to apply the recovery fund. ""Our faith in Europe has proven correct!"" tweeted the Italian president of the European Parliament, David Sassoli triumphantly, as soon as EU finance ministers announced the deal. So is he right: is everything hunky-dory now in the EU? The dark mutterings of deep divisions banished? Not really. The EU is stumbling through this crisis as it has done through the migration and the financial crises before, for instance. The bloc is not about to disintegrate but scars will remain in countries that felt the chilly absence of EU solidarity in their hour of coronavirus need. ""This has not been our finest moment,"" a diplomat from an influential EU country told me. ""Our response has come late and has been marred by nationalism. Solidarity went out the window with the first coronavirus victim."" Read more from Katya Adler The coronavirus pandemic has exposed deep divisions in Europe, where Italy and Spain have accused northern nations - led by Germany and the Netherlands - of not doing enough. This video can not be played Italian PM Giuseppe Conte told the BBC in April how the lockdown could be eased Speaking before the agreement, Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte told the BBC that the EU needs to rise to the challenge of what he calls ""the biggest test since the Second World War."" The infection rate is slowing in Italy. Latest figures show positive cases increasing from the previous day by a little over 1%. Two weeks ago, the rise was 7%. The death rate is also falling. Spain's Prime Minister Pedro SÃ¡nchez also saidthe situation there was improving. He told MPs in Madrid on Thursday: ""The fire starts to come under control."" He vowed that the country would have ""total victory"" over the virus. According to latest data from the past 24 hours, Spain has recorded 683 deaths - a drop from the 757 reported on Wednesday. In recent days, leaders have begun to sound more positive. Small, non-essential shops are set to open in Austria and Czech Republic next week. Denmark's schools and kindergartens will reopen on 15 April, and Norway's on 20 April. Even Italy is considering when some lockdown measures could gradually be relaxed. Mr Conte said: ""If scientists confirm it, we might be able to relax some measures already by the end of this month."" However Spain extended its state of emergency on Thursday until 26 April, keeping people at home for a further two weeks. There are also widespread concerns about the Easter weekend, when people usually travel to see loved ones. Portugal has tightened lockdown measures for Easter, with a ban on people leaving their local area without official documentation.

"A former BBC journalist described as a central character at Westminster and master of interviewing politicians on the street has died aged 61. Paul Lambert, affectionately known as ""Gobby"", was often heard on TV shouting questions at ministers. He left the BBC in 2014 to become communications director of UKIP. His daughter Danni said on Facebook the family were ""devastated"". BBC Head of Westminster Katy Searle called him an ""institution at Westminster"". ""His fearless approach to political doorsteps made politicians cower and journalist colleagues cheer,"" she added. ""We are all deeply saddened by the news and send our very best wishes to his family."" BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg described Mr Lambert as a ""fixture of politics"". Writing on Twitter, she added he was a ""friend of everyone for so long - such sad, sad news"". Former BBC colleagues and journalists from rival broadcasters, as well as some of the politicians he pursued, have taken to social media to pay tribute to his tenacity, kindness and unerring nose for a story. BBC journalist James Landale, who worked with Mr Lambert for many years at Westminster, called him ""a BBC legend, a one man institution, the best fixer in the business"". Allow Twitter content?

Based on Downing Street, Mr Lambert's voice was heard on countless news reports putting ministers on the spot as they went about their business. The nickname ""Gobby"" was a reference to his booming voice, which he used to project awkward questions towards politicians as they entered cars or walked down the street, known in broadcasting as a ""doorstep"". ""The point really is to fill in the pieces of the TV bulletin piece that you haven't got pictures to fill in. You know someone isn't going to say anything, you just need something to happen,""Mr Lambert explained in 2013. Others paying tribute on Twitter included journalist, and fellow exponent of the snatched street interview,  Michael Crick, who said Mr Lambert was a ""master of the political doorstep"".

Trade Minister Conor Burns said: ""I remember the first time he shouted questions at me as I walked into Parliament. Went inside with a feeling I'd properly arrived."" Former leader of UKIP Nigel Farage said Mr Lambert was a ""unique man and great fun to work with"". Labour MP Yvette Cooper said Mr Lambert was ""ever persistent, ever the mischievous grin, ever friendly even when pursuing you with the toughest of questions"". Craig Oliver, a former editor of flagship BBC News bulletins and ex-director of communications at No 10, said: ""The start of a thousand TV news reports was Gobby shouting, 'Are you going to resign?'"" Robert Peston, ITV's political editor, said Mr Lambert was a ""gent of the old school"" who had ""the best nose for a story"", while Sky News presenter Sophy Ridge described him as a ""legend"". BBC presenter Jeremy Vine said Mr Lambert was ""an amazing guy, wonderful to work with at Westminster"". This video can not be played As ""Gobby"" gets ready to start his new role, Newsnight looked back on some of the moments which earned him his nickname. BBC health editor Hugh Pym said Mr Lambert ""always went the extra mile and asked the right question"", and BBC news presenter Reeta Chakrabarti said he was ""such a central character in our Westminster newsroom for years... and a thoroughly nice man"". Mr Lambert - who started his career as an electrician before working his way up through the ranks at the BBC -left the BBC ahead of the 2015 general electionto lead communications for the UK Independence Party.

"Home rental firm Airbnb is to temporarily restrict UK bookings to key workers and âessential staysâ because of the coronavirus crisis. The firm said that the measure would last until at least 18 April. Key workers - such as NHS and social care staff, and transport and food retail employees - can still book through a programme calledFrontline Stays,external. The decision comes after the government criticised opportunistic hosts. TheBBC had reported on Mondaythat some listings were letting customers use the âinstant bookâ function without requiring them to be vetted. At the time, some owners were describing their properties as being ""Covid-19 retreats"" and ""perfect for isolating with family"" on the site. Tourism Minister Nigel Huddleston described this as being ""irresponsible and dangerous"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

A BBC London investigation subsequently found hundreds of properties - some within shared accommodation - were being marketed in the capital to tourists for the coming Easter bank holiday weekend. Using a regular account, the BBC questioned some of the landlords to check the bookings were still available. ""Yes, it's a shared accommodation with me and my two daughters, you can have the room,"" one replied. Another said: ""You will have your private room but with shared bathroom. Toilet and shower is shared with seven other rooms on the same floor."" Neither property owner asked if the booking was for a key worker. Airbnb said it would take action in response to the findings. The Frontline Stays programme is designed to provide up to 100,000 healthcare staff and first-responders with accommodation close to their patients and a safe distance away from their own families. Government rules state that tourism-related accommodation should only be provided to key workers needing to self-isolate during the pandemic.

Mr Conte says the European Union needs to rise to the challenge of what he calls ""the biggest test since the Second World War"". This was his first interview with the UK broadcast media since the pandemic exploded in Italy seven weeks ago. He was speaking as Italy and some other EU countries try to push more frugal members of the bloc to issue so-called ""corona bonds"" - sharing debt that all EU nations would help to pay off. The Netherlands in particular has opposed the idea, leading to a clash between finance ministers of the eurozone. This video can not be played A month into Italy's strict lockdown, some people can no longer afford to buy food The Italian prime minister told the BBC that Europe's leaders were ""facing an appointment with history"" that they could not miss.

He initially resisted a push by some politicians in Lombardy, the northern region worst hit by the outbreak, to impose tighter measures more quickly. When a delegation from the Chinese Red Cross came to Milan in mid-March, they lambasted what they saw as Italy's lax lockdown. But the prime minister defended his government's action. ""Going back, I would do the same"", he said. ""We have a completely different system to China.

"Coronavirus has now infected more than one million people worldwide, but its impact extends far beyond just those who have had it. Even the frequency of use of the word ""unprecedented"" is unprecedented at the moment. According to Google Trends it's been used three times more over the last two weeks than the highest point recorded previously. As governments around the world have enacted new measures and given official advice, we take a look at the impact that it's had on people and the world around them. The approaches to dealing with coronavirus across the world have been wide-rangingto say the least. In Colombia the days that you're allowed to leave the house depend on the number of your national ID card; in Serbia a designated dog-walking hour was introduced; and in Belarus the president has gone against medical advice, recommending vodka and saunas as a way to stay safe. Some of the more common approaches have seen governments issue recommendations on social distancing for part or all of the country, while others have acted to restrict all non-essential internal movement. The latter is often called a lockdown. When the virus was first identified in China in late 2019, lockdown seemed extreme. But as the outbreak has spread around the world, it has become more difficult to manage. More countries have opted to take the strictest measures possible to contain it. Well over 100 countries worldwide had instituted either a full or partial lockdown by the end of March 2020, affecting billions of people. And many others had recommended restricted movement for some or all of their citizens. In regions that have only recently confirmed their first cases of coronavirus, many countries appear to be learning from their Asian and European counterparts. Governments seem to be acting faster and more strictly in Africa as well. China has managed to ease its restrictions after passing through the worst period of climbing cases and deaths, but life is still far from normal. The rest of us may have a long way to go. When the virus first appeared, several countries brought in initial restrictions on flights from China, or required visitors from at-risk areas to be quarantined on arrival. After it had been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization, on 11 March, there were more all-encompassing measures. President Trump blocked all non-essential arrivals to the US from the European Union on 15 March, and a day later the EU did the same to all visitors from outside the Schengen free-travel zone. By the end of March, air traffic from some of the world's biggest airports had dropped to a fraction of what it was at the same time last year, or even what it was at the start of this month. The number of commercial flights last month was down by more than a quarter globally,according to flight tracking service Flightradar24,external. In the final week of March, as more and more countries introduced travel restrictions to try to contain the virus, traffic declined 63% from the same period last year. On 25 March, Heathrow - one of the busiest airports in the world serving about 80 million passengers per year - recorded more than 1,000 fewer flights compared with an equivalent day in 2019. It's not just getting from city to city. Travel within major cities across the globe has ground to a halt as restrictions on movement and social contact have come into force. As of 31 March, residents in cities like Madrid, Paris, London and New York were making fewer than one-tenth as many journeys using the app as they did normally, according to data from travel app Citymapper. In Milan in northern Italy, which has been locked down for several weeks now, only 3% of trips were being planned via the Citymapper mobile app, compared with before the outbreak. The data also suggests that people cut down on travel in the days leading up to government-enforced shutdowns. For example, the partial lockdown in Sao Paulo, Brazil's most populous city, came into place on 24 March but trips had already declined sharply the week before. Even in cities where authorities have issued recommendations on social distancing and refrained from imposing strict lockdowns, it appears that people are still restricting their travel. ln Stockholm, Sweden, where the government has avoided draconian measures, issuing guidelines rather than strict rules, the Citymapper data suggests planned trips - which can include both walking and public transport - fell by 70%. Stockholm's public transport company reported last week that passenger numbers on subway and commuter trains had halved. Movement is also below normal rates in some of the Asian cities that Citymapper collects data for, like Hong Kong and Singapore, which have not enforced the type of shutdowns seen elsewhere. The South Korean capital Seoul hasn't come to a standstill like European capitals, despite facing huge numbers of coronavirus cases - a sign of the country's decision to focus on widespread testing and contact tracing rather than social distancing. We see the same behaviour with people on the roads. Major cities around the world were already becoming steadily less busy before official lockdown measures came in, congestion data from location technology specialists TomTom shows. In Tokyo there hasn't been an official lockdown yet, but schools have been shut since the beginning of March. That, and a lack of tourists, could explain why traffic there has been marginally below last year's levels without the sharp downturn obvious elsewhere. In Jakarta, Indonesia, where there has also been no official lockdown, congestion has already dropped to almost zero - similar to Los Angeles and New Delhi which shut down on different dates. The congestion score in the graphic below is an indication of how much longer it would take to make a journey through the city compared with when there is no traffic at all. A rating of 50 means that a trip will take 50% more time than it would if the roads were completely free, for example, so a half-hour drive would become 45 minutes. The regular low points on the chart generally come at weekends. In China there are signs that things are beginning to get back to normal. Traffic levels are back to about half the 2019 level in Beijing and Shanghai but have been steadily growing since the beginning of February following extended Chinese New Year celebrations from 25 January. In Wuhan, where the outbreak originated, traffic levels are still next to zero compared with last year. One of the few positive effects of the shutdown is that there seems to have been a drop in pollution in some parts of the world. Levels of NO2 in the atmosphere fluctuate widely with factors like wind speed, and satellites trying to measure these levels can be hampered by cloud cover. This may explain some of the variability seen over Wuhan and northern Italy between January and March 2019 in the maps below. But in these places, shutdowns have been stricter and in place for longer than elsewhere, and the change in NO2 levels between 2019 and the months of 2020 in which the shutdowns have been in effect appears to be significant. In the UK, and in many other places, the available satellite data does not yet show either way whether the ongoing reduction in economic activity is being accompanied by a corresponding fall in emissions, althoughsome other sourcessuggest that it is. As countries have shut down, many workers have had to try to continue their office jobs from home. That means video calls and instant messaging have become invaluable workroom tools. The average number of messages sent by users in New York, Paris, London and Berlin has increased by more than a third in just a few weeks. Not everyone has got used to their new ways of working just yet. But - depending on where you are - there could be a good deal of time left to do so.

"The PM was last seen in public a week ago Boris Johnsonâs health continues to improve in hospital, Downing Street has said after the PM spent his third night in intensive care. A No 10 spokesman described the prime minister as being in âgood spiritsâ as he continues to receive care in St Thomasâ Hospital, London. Mr Johnson is being given oxygen, having contracted coronavirus. He was taken to hospital on Sunday - 10 days after testing positive - and was moved to intensive care on Monday. Stay home over Easter to stop virus, public told Downing Street said Mr Johnson was continuing with ""standard oxygen treatment"". His spokesman has previously confirmed the prime minister has not been on a ventilator. The spokesman said No 10 was âhugely gratefulâ for the messages of support and that the prime minister âthanks NHS staff for the brilliant care which he has been receivingâ. Dominic Raab is deputising for the PM while he in hospital At Thursday's Downing Street coronavirus briefing, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab gave a brief update on Mr Johnson's condition, saying: ""He is still in intensive care but continues to make positive steps and is in good spirits."" Mr Raab, who is deputising for the PM while he remains in hospital, said he had chaired an emergency Cobra meeting, with senior ministers and officials from the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish governments, and the London mayor, to ""take stock and assess where we are right across the United Kingdom"" on social distancing measures. He said the ""early signs"" were that the measures were having the desired effect, but it was ""too early to say that conclusively"", and they would be kept under review.

Asked if he had the authority to make decisions on the lockdown while Mr Johnson is in intensive care, he said: ""I've got all the authority I need to make the relevant decisions."" He said it was a ""team effort"" but he had been deputised by the prime minister to make calls such as this. Mr Raab has said he is ""confident"" the prime minister will recover from the virus. In an interview with TalkRadio, Home Secretary Priti Patel said she was ""rooting"" for Mr Johnson, and revealed that she had not spoken to the PM since last week. ""I've been involved in every single key government zoom meeting. I spoke to him last week, around the time of the last cabinet meeting, the last formal meeting I was involved with him. ""It was clear he was unwell, he needed to get rest and recuperation."" Mr Johnson was most recently seen in public last Thursday when he joined the country in clapping for NHS workers on the steps of Downing Street. Meanwhile, the prime minister's chief adviser Dominic Cummings has been self-isolating with coronavirus symptoms. The PM's official spokesman said Mr Cummings was not back in Number 10, but he was in contact.

"There were 1,132 coronavirus-related breaches reported between 25 March and 7 April Greater Manchester Police has warned people not to breach lockdown rules over Easter after it had to break up 660 parties during the pandemic. Chief Constable Ian Hopkins said ""each and every one of us need take this seriously"". There were 1,132 coronavirus-related breaches reported between 25 March and 7 April, the force said. That included 494 house parties - some with DJs, fireworks and bouncy castles - and 166 street parties. One woman in Bury became the first person in Greater Manchester to be charged under the Coronavirus Act 2020 after police had to repeatedly shut down one of the gatherings. The force, which has released updated figures, also had to deal with 122 different groups gathering to play sports, 173 more gatherings in parks and 112 incidents of anti-social behaviour and public disorder. Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham said such behaviour was ""completely unacceptable"". ""They are putting everybody at risk,"" he said. ""The vast majority of people in Greater Manchester are observing the guidelines, but we cannot have a situation where we've got people flouting the rules. ""If you are going out and about you are putting at risk the most vulnerable members of our community and you need to have a good hard look at yourself."" Chief Constable Ian Hopkins warned against breaching the rules over the Easter weekend The region's deputy mayor for policing and crime, Beverley Hughes, said the number coronavirus-related incidents had risen considerably. Officers responded to about 500 callouts a day last weekend, she said. However, she said calls for enforcement for businesses not complying with the rules had fallen. Mr Hopkins said: ""We understand the desire people will have to spend time with family and friends over the Easter period, however it is vital that we follow the government guidelines.

"This video can not be played Italian PM Giuseppe Conte told the BBC in April how the lockdown could be eased Italy's prime minister has told the BBC that the European Union risks failing as a project in the coronavirus crisis. Giuseppe Conte says the EU must act in an adequate and co-ordinated way to help countries worst hit by the virus. Mr Conte says the European Union needs to rise to the challenge of what he calls ""the biggest test since the Second World War"". This was his first interview with the UK broadcast media since the pandemic exploded in Italy seven weeks ago. He was speaking as Italy and some other EU countries try to push more frugal members of the bloc to issue so-called ""corona bonds"" - sharing debt that all EU nations would help to pay off. The Netherlands in particular has opposed the idea, leading to a clash between finance ministers of the eurozone. This video can not be played A month into Italy's strict lockdown, some people can no longer afford to buy food The Italian prime minister told the BBC that Europe's leaders were ""facing an appointment with history"" that they could not miss. ""If we do not seize the opportunity to put new life into the European project, the risk of failure is real."" The infection rate in Italy is slowing - the latest figures show positive cases increasing from the previous day by a little over 1%. Two weeks ago, the rise was 7%. Europe's care homes struggle as virus deaths rise Italy extends lockdown but hopes to turn corner The death toll too shows signs of falling, from 919 a fortnight ago to 542 fatalities in the past 24 hours. But Giuseppe Conte warned Italy not to lower its guard and said that the national lockdown, imposed on 9 March, could only be eased gradually. ""We need to pick sectors that can restart their activity. If scientists confirm it, we might begin to relax some measures already by the end of this month."" More than 17,000 people have died in Italy from Covid-19 Mr Conte has won plaudits for his government's handling of the crisis - a recent poll by Demosshowed his approval rating surging from 46% to 71%,external. But critics contend that the restrictions announced in the first few days were slow and piecemeal. He initially resisted a push by some politicians in Lombardy, the northern region worst hit by the outbreak, to impose tighter measures more quickly. When a delegation from the Chinese Red Cross came to Milan in mid-March, they lambasted what they saw as Italy's lax lockdown. But the prime minister defended his government's action. ""Going back, I would do the same"", he said. ""We have a completely different system to China. For us to severely limit constitutional freedoms was a critical decision that we had to consider very carefully. If I had suggested a lockdown or limits on constitutional rights at the start, when there were the first clusters, people would have taken me for a madman."" A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash Italy maintains that one of the reasons behind the large number of cases here is that it has performed more tests than many other western countries. While Britain is now averaging around 14,000 tests per day, Italy's testing level is around double that figure. In the past day, it has carried out more than 50,000 tests. Mr Conte refused to criticise directly any other country for testing too lightly - but he compared it to ""coping with the situation in the dark"". The slowing of the infection rate is gradually easing pressure in intensive care units, though in Lombardy and some other areas, they remain close to capacity. And the toll on Italy's medics has been immense - nearly 100 doctors have died. In the past day, Italy performed more than 50,000 coronavirus tests Providing some backup have been countries including China, Cuba and Russia, which have sent medical teams and supplies. Moscow has capitalised on the initiative for its public relations, adding a message ""from Russia with love"" to the plane of equipment. Russian state television broadcast footage of an Italian man replacing an EU flag with a Russian one. Asked whether Russia's aid to Italy had conditions attached, possibly including the Italian government supporting lifting EU sanctions on Moscow, Mr Conte hit back. ""The mere insinuation offends me deeply"", he said. ""It's an offence to the Italian governmentâ¦ and also to Vladimir Putin, who would never dream of using this as leverage."" Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte told the BBC that coronavirus was the biggest test since the Second World War The fact is that Italy needs all the friends it can get at the moment, with latest forecasts suggesting the outbreak will lead its economy to contract by more than 11% and national debt to rise to unsustainable levels. The prime minister called it an ""economic and social emergency"" that was testing the financial structure of every country. In southern Italy, there have been isolated cases of supermarkets being raided. Four weeks into the nationwide lockdown, patience is being tested. And as this crisis grinds on, Italians are growing exhausted with the daily loss of hundreds of lives. There may be hope that the worst of the outbreak is behind them - but it will take a generation to recover. ""I feel the pain of the gaping wound that this nation is experiencing"", Mr Conte said. ""Behind the numbers are names and surnames, life stories and broken families. The Italian nation is suffering."" How have you been affected by the issues relating to coronavirus?

"A large proportion of NHS doctors are from an ethnic minority background Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said that people from ethnic minority backgrounds are ""disproportionately"" dying with coronavirus. A number of reviews, including by the Office for National Statistics and Public Health England, have now concluded that this is the case. Suggested reasons have included existing health inequalities, housing conditions, public-facing occupations and structural racism. There were at least 3,876 deaths of black and minority ethnic (BAME) individuals in hospitals in England up to 9 June. This means that, where ethnicity is known, BAME people represented 15.5% of all deaths to this point. The 2011 census - the most accurate source -showed that 14.5% of the English population,externalwere from BAME backgrounds.  But clearly the proportion may have grown since then. Virus 'has disproportionate impact on BAME groups' Coronavirus cases to be tracked by ethnicity In 2016,the Office for National Statistics estimated,externalthat it could have increased to 15.4% of the population. Similar breakdowns by ethnicity for Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland are not currently available. These numbers do not show a great disproportionality in BAME deaths, but once we account for demographics - such as age and location - a different story is told. Some of the highest death and hospitalisation rates during the outbreak have been in London, where 40% of the population are from ethnic minority backgrounds (according to the 2011 census). But even when you adjust for where the coronavirus outbreak has hit hardest, the Office for National Statistics, the Institute for Fiscal Studies think-tank and Public Health England all conclude that people from ethnic minorities are being disproportionately impacted. Researchfrom the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS),externalshows that if we only looked at where BAME communities were concentrated, we might expect to see higher death rates than that for white British individuals. Black African Brits face 'triple' virus death rate However, the research says that this geographical factor is counter-balanced by the factor of age. Most minority groups are much younger on average than white Britons - and therefore should be less susceptible to the virus. The IFS concludes that, if we look at both geography and age combined, the death rate should be lower for most ethnicities than for white people. It estimates that the deaths of black Africans are 3.7 times higher than might be expected by geography and age, 2.9 times higher for Pakistanis and 1.8 for black Caribbean people (who are older on average than other minority groups). Public Health England,which approached the issue in a similar way,externalby adjusting for age, found similar disparities in both the infection rate and deaths for BAME people. TheONS research goes one step further,externalthan these reviews and looks at other factors, such as health and deprivation. It concludes that: Black people are 1.9 times as likely to die as white people Bangladeshis and Pakistanis are 1.8 times as likely to die Indians are around 1.5 times as likely Analysis from Public Health England (PHE) showed that once in hospital, people from BAME backgrounds were also more likely to require admission to an intensive care unit. BAME people accounted for 11% of those hospitalised with Covid-19 but over 36% of those admitted to critical care. Separate researchhas found that South Asian people were the most likely to die from coronavirus after being admitted to hospital in Great Britain. The study, which looked at nearly 35,000 Covid-19 patients in 260 hospitals, said high levels of diabetes was partly to blame. Health issues, living conditions and occupation could all play a role. While there is no conclusive evidence that minority groups are more at risk from the disease, some are more likely to have certain underlying health conditions. Black people are more likely to be overweight than white people, for example, while both Asian and black populations have been found to have a higher risk of diabetes and heart disease, according to the IFS. Both of these have been linked to higher coronavirus death rates. Various factors can play into these health inequalities,according to Public Health England,external, including socio-economic situation, access to health care and deprivation in an area. It's worth noting that deprivation in general, regardless of ethnicity, appears to play a role. According to the Office of National Statistics,external, the death rate in the poorest communities in England and Wales is twice as high as the wealthiest. Issues with self-isolation in larger households could also play a factor. Just under a third of Bangladeshi households are classified as overcrowded, as are 15% of black African households, according to government statistics. Only 2% of white British households are classified as overcrowded. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash STRESS:How to look after your mental health Black and other ethnic minority individuals make up a large share of jobs considered essential in tackling the virus, many of which are public-facing. One in five people working for the NHS in England, for example, is from an ethnic minority background, and these numbers are even higher when we look solely at doctors and nurses. Public Health England,through engagement with members,externalof the public and experts, found that structural racism could also play a part. ""Historic racism and poorer experiences of healthcare or at work may mean that individuals in BAME groups are less likely to seek care when needed or as NHS staff are less likely to speak up when they have concerns about Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) or risk,"" the report says. A recent survey of NHS staff found that 29% of BAME staff felt bullied in the past year compared with 24% of white people.

"IT consultant Alex Hilton with wife Jenny and sons Joe and James British consumers say they are struggling to get refunds on cancelled holidays due to the coronavirus outbreak. IT consultant Alex Hilton and his wife Jenny had planned a skiing holiday in France with university friends they had stayed in touch with over many years. Last July, they made a booking for 20 people to stay at the Chalet Amelia in Val D'Isere this April. The total cost of the chalet alone came to Â£17,000. The coronavirus lockdown means they cannot go. But they have been told that they are not entitled to a refund or rebooking on the chalet. ""The chalet company says they are open for business but the ski resort is shut, and British Airways have cancelled the flights to France, so I can't even get there,"" says Mr Hilton. ""I find it really unethical and unfair that the chalet company is washing their hands of it and are choosing to keep that money completely."" Mr Hilton said he is now pursuing a refund with his insurance company. The accommodation provider in question is Hampshire-based firm Chardons Ltd, which operates the Chalet Chardons brand (not to be confused with Edinburgh-based Le Chardon Mountain Lodges, which also operates in Val d'Isere). The company says it is deeply apologetic but is resolute that it will not be providing refunds or rebookings. Although non-essential travel was banned both by France and the UK on 24 Marchthe French government decreed that hotels and other lodgings can remain open,external. ""We [asked] our commune to issue an order forcing us to close our doors so that we could then cancel on our clients,"" says Chardons Ltd's director Mark Hayman. ""The representatives of our commune expressly refused to oblige us."" As a result, Chalet Chardons has had to ask its guests to cancel their holidays because the company was advised that it would be in breach of its agreements with customers if it cancelled the holidays itself. Chalets at the Val D'Isere ski resort in France are not required to close during the coronavirus lockdown Mr Hayman stressed that anyone who books accommodation with Chalet Chardons has to have adequate travel insurance. The firm has therefore asked its guests to claim on their insurance and to follow the Foreign & Commonwealth Office's (FCO) guidelines advising against non-essential travel, to avoid insurance claims being invalidated. ""We understand that these are difficult times for everyone, but as a small family-owned business we simply don't have the financial resources to allow us to refund all of our guests and remain solvent. ""In the event of non-payment by the insurers we would attempt to find an equitable solution with the guests, but we would still not be able to refund, as we lack the funds to do so. At this point in the season, the bulk of our costs have already been incurred and we are unlikely to be able to recover them,"" says Mr Hayman. 'I don't want a flight voucher, where's my refund?' Coronavirus: What are your travel rights? Rescue flights for stranded Britons But Mr Hilton disagrees: ""Our holiday was the penultimate week of the ski season. They say they'd be out of pocket but actually they're considerably in pocket in this situation. ""To not even offer a portion of a refund is extremely poor."" Many consumers who booked package holidays that have been cancelled are also struggling to get refunds if the holidays started just before the FCOissued its advice on non-essential travel on 17 March. Newlyweds David and Natalie Rogers, from Dudley, saved for two years for their dream honeymoon safari trip in Kenya. Their flight was on 15 March and although Kenya's president announced quarantine measures and suspension of travel into the country on that day, neither the FCO nor Kenyan Airlines issued any advice. The couple felt they had to get on the flight, or face being told by Virgin Holidays that they were not entitled to the holiday or compensation because they had failed to show up. They did make it to Kenya, but after only a few hours their flights were changed and they flew back to the UK the next morning. David and Natalie Rogers had their honeymoon cut short after just a few hours Mr Rogers says the couple had a ""really stressful"" experience when they tried to contact Virgin Holidays for a refund or rebooking of their honeymoon. ""We were quite angry about having to wait on hold for over eight hours, and a message on the line saying that travellers should have already received a voucher for their missed holidays. It just felt like we'd been forgotten about."" On top of this, Virgin Holidays told the couple it would not be issuing any refunds or rebookings, and that they had to claim from their insurer. The couple then spent hours on hold to their insurer, only to be told that the package holiday operator was legally liable. Virgin Holidays initially said that it wouldn't be offering the couple a full refund because they had managed to leave the UK for a short time. However, after intervention by the BBC, the firm decided to issue a full refund ""as a gesture of goodwill"". A Virgin Holidays spokesman said: ""We fully understand the disappointment for any customer whose holiday was cut short due to UK government advice changing and will be happy to help customers affected receive a refund for any unused elements of their holiday, such as accommodation costs. ""Because confirmation from suppliers, such as hotels, may not always be possible, we may refer customers to engage with their travel insurer at the same time to ensure as swift an outcome as possible."" Consumer rights group Which? says it has received hundreds of complaints from out-of-pocket holidaymakers. ""At a time when they may desperately need the money, package holiday providers must not only do right by their customers but fulfil their legal obligations and ensure they are processing refunds should their customers ask for one,"" said Rory Boland, editor of Which? Travel. Abta is warning that the travel industry could collapse if forced to refund all cancelled holidays within 14 days But the holiday industry is facing its own financial pressures  - the travel agents' group, ABTA is urgently appealing to the government to extend the 14-day period for cash refunds. It says travel agents and tour operators are being asked to provide refunds on a ""mass scale"" within 14 days while they themselves are waiting for money back from airlines and hotels that have closed because of the pandemic. ""It's in nobody's interests for normally healthy, viable businesses to go bust,"" says ABTA's chief executive Mark Tanzer. ""Hundreds of thousands of jobs are at risk and the UK taxpayer will have to foot the bill for customer refunds if there is an industry-wide collapse of travel businesses."" But Which? says package holiday operators still need to follow travel regulations andcannot use customer money to bail out the industry,external. ""We would encourage holidaymakers to consider the option of rebooking or accepting a voucher but package holiday providers must inform customers of their right to a refund and process one when it is the preferred option,"" says Mr Boland. ""Airlines and hotels must also return customer money for cancelled holidays to agents and package providers to facilitate this process."" Update 15 April 2020: This story has been updated to make clear that the couple planning to visit Chalet Amelia are pursuing a refund with their insurance company and to include more detail from Chardons Ltd in response.

"A large proportion of NHS doctors are from an ethnic minority background Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said that people from ethnic minority backgrounds are ""disproportionately"" dying with coronavirus. A number of reviews, including by the Office for National Statistics and Public Health England, have now concluded that this is the case. Suggested reasons have included existing health inequalities, housing conditions, public-facing occupations and structural racism. There were at least 3,876 deaths of black and minority ethnic (BAME) individuals in hospitals in England up to 9 June. This means that, where ethnicity is known, BAME people represented 15.5% of all deaths to this point. The 2011 census - the most accurate source -showed that 14.5% of the English population,externalwere from BAME backgrounds.  But clearly the proportion may have grown since then. Virus 'has disproportionate impact on BAME groups' Coronavirus cases to be tracked by ethnicity In 2016,the Office for National Statistics estimated,externalthat it could have increased to 15.4% of the population. Similar breakdowns by ethnicity for Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland are not currently available. These numbers do not show a great disproportionality in BAME deaths, but once we account for demographics - such as age and location - a different story is told. Some of the highest death and hospitalisation rates during the outbreak have been in London, where 40% of the population are from ethnic minority backgrounds (according to the 2011 census). But even when you adjust for where the coronavirus outbreak has hit hardest, the Office for National Statistics, the Institute for Fiscal Studies think-tank and Public Health England all conclude that people from ethnic minorities are being disproportionately impacted. Researchfrom the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS),externalshows that if we only looked at where BAME communities were concentrated, we might expect to see higher death rates than that for white British individuals. Black African Brits face 'triple' virus death rate However, the research says that this geographical factor is counter-balanced by the factor of age. Most minority groups are much younger on average than white Britons - and therefore should be less susceptible to the virus. The IFS concludes that, if we look at both geography and age combined, the death rate should be lower for most ethnicities than for white people. It estimates that the deaths of black Africans are 3.7 times higher than might be expected by geography and age, 2.9 times higher for Pakistanis and 1.8 for black Caribbean people (who are older on average than other minority groups). Public Health England,which approached the issue in a similar way,externalby adjusting for age, found similar disparities in both the infection rate and deaths for BAME people. TheONS research goes one step further,externalthan these reviews and looks at other factors, such as health and deprivation. It concludes that: Black people are 1.9 times as likely to die as white people Bangladeshis and Pakistanis are 1.8 times as likely to die Indians are around 1.5 times as likely Analysis from Public Health England (PHE) showed that once in hospital, people from BAME backgrounds were also more likely to require admission to an intensive care unit. BAME people accounted for 11% of those hospitalised with Covid-19 but over 36% of those admitted to critical care. Separate researchhas found that South Asian people were the most likely to die from coronavirus after being admitted to hospital in Great Britain. The study, which looked at nearly 35,000 Covid-19 patients in 260 hospitals, said high levels of diabetes was partly to blame. Health issues, living conditions and occupation could all play a role. While there is no conclusive evidence that minority groups are more at risk from the disease, some are more likely to have certain underlying health conditions. Black people are more likely to be overweight than white people, for example, while both Asian and black populations have been found to have a higher risk of diabetes and heart disease, according to the IFS. Both of these have been linked to higher coronavirus death rates. Various factors can play into these health inequalities,according to Public Health England,external, including socio-economic situation, access to health care and deprivation in an area. It's worth noting that deprivation in general, regardless of ethnicity, appears to play a role. According to the Office of National Statistics,external, the death rate in the poorest communities in England and Wales is twice as high as the wealthiest. Issues with self-isolation in larger households could also play a factor. Just under a third of Bangladeshi households are classified as overcrowded, as are 15% of black African households, according to government statistics. Only 2% of white British households are classified as overcrowded. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash STRESS:How to look after your mental health Black and other ethnic minority individuals make up a large share of jobs considered essential in tackling the virus, many of which are public-facing. One in five people working for the NHS in England, for example, is from an ethnic minority background, and these numbers are even higher when we look solely at doctors and nurses. Public Health England,through engagement with members,externalof the public and experts, found that structural racism could also play a part. ""Historic racism and poorer experiences of healthcare or at work may mean that individuals in BAME groups are less likely to seek care when needed or as NHS staff are less likely to speak up when they have concerns about Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) or risk,"" the report says. A recent survey of NHS staff found that 29% of BAME staff felt bullied in the past year compared with 24% of white people.

"The PM was last seen in public a week ago Boris Johnsonâs health continues to improve in hospital, Downing Street has said after the PM spent his third night in intensive care. A No 10 spokesman described the prime minister as being in âgood spiritsâ as he continues to receive care in St Thomasâ Hospital, London. Mr Johnson is being given oxygen, having contracted coronavirus. He was taken to hospital on Sunday - 10 days after testing positive - and was moved to intensive care on Monday. Stay home over Easter to stop virus, public told Downing Street said Mr Johnson was continuing with ""standard oxygen treatment"". His spokesman has previously confirmed the prime minister has not been on a ventilator. The spokesman said No 10 was âhugely gratefulâ for the messages of support and that the prime minister âthanks NHS staff for the brilliant care which he has been receivingâ. Dominic Raab is deputising for the PM while he in hospital At Thursday's Downing Street coronavirus briefing, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab gave a brief update on Mr Johnson's condition, saying: ""He is still in intensive care but continues to make positive steps and is in good spirits."" Mr Raab, who is deputising for the PM while he remains in hospital, said he had chaired an emergency Cobra meeting, with senior ministers and officials from the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish governments, and the London mayor, to ""take stock and assess where we are right across the United Kingdom"" on social distancing measures. He said the ""early signs"" were that the measures were having the desired effect, but it was ""too early to say that conclusively"", and they would be kept under review.

Asked if he had the authority to make decisions on the lockdown while Mr Johnson is in intensive care, he said: ""I've got all the authority I need to make the relevant decisions."" He said it was a ""team effort"" but he had been deputised by the prime minister to make calls such as this. Mr Raab has said he is ""confident"" the prime minister will recover from the virus. In an interview with TalkRadio, Home Secretary Priti Patel said she was ""rooting"" for Mr Johnson, and revealed that she had not spoken to the PM since last week. ""I've been involved in every single key government zoom meeting. I spoke to him last week, around the time of the last cabinet meeting, the last formal meeting I was involved with him. ""It was clear he was unwell, he needed to get rest and recuperation."" Mr Johnson was most recently seen in public last Thursday when he joined the country in clapping for NHS workers on the steps of Downing Street. Meanwhile, the prime minister's chief adviser Dominic Cummings has been self-isolating with coronavirus symptoms. The PM's official spokesman said Mr Cummings was not back in Number 10, but he was in contact.

"Medical workers react as they take part in the nationwide daily gratitude applause Spain is close to passing the worst of its coronavirus outbreak, the prime minister said, as the Spanish parliament approved a 15-day extension to the national state of emergency. ""The fire starts to come under control,"" PM Pedro SÃ¡nchez told MPs in Madrid, saying the country would have âtotal victoryâ over the virus. Spain has Europe's highest number of confirmed cases, with 152,446. As of Thursday, the country has reported 15,238 deaths. Mr SÃ¡nchez is the latest European leader to suggest the situation may be stabilising. His comments came ahead of news that EU finance ministers had agreed a â¬500bn (Â£440bn; $546bn) rescue package for European countries hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic. The deal, reached after marathon discussions in Brussels that began on Tuesday, was announced by the chairman of the Eurogroup finance ministers, MÃ¡rio Centeno. The French Finance Minister, Bruno Le Maire, said the agreement was the most important economic plan in EU history. The ministers fell short of accepting a demand by France and Italy to share out the cost of the crisis by issuing so-called ""corona bonds"" (or eurobonds) - mutualised debt that all EU nations help to pay off. Financial crisis 'on steroids' facing EU leaders Coronavirus outbreak eats into EU unity On Thursday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said her country rejected a plan to share out coronavirus-incurred debt in the form of ""coronabonds"" (or eurobonds) - mutualised debt that all EU nations help to pay off. ""You know that I don't believe we should have common debt because of the situation of our political union and that's why we reject this... but there are so many ways to show solidarity and I believe we will find a good solution,"" she said. This video can not be played Italian PM Giuseppe Conte told the BBC in April how the lockdown could be eased Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte earlier told the BBC: ""If we do not seize the opportunity to put new life into the European project, the risk of failure is real."" According to latest data from the past 24 hours, Spain has recorded 683 deaths â a drop from the 757 reported on Wednesday. Total confirmed cases now stand at 152,446, and Spain has now reported the second-highest number worldwide after the US, which has more than 400,000. On Thursday, Spanish lawmakers participated remotely in a parliamentary debate before agreeing hours later to extend the country's state of emergency until 26 April, keeping people at home for a further two weeks. This video can not be played Spanish doctor 'scared and exhausted' by pandemic Spain has imposed some of the strictest measures in Europe. But Mr SÃ¡nchez said they had helped drastically cut the infection rate. Europe is still the region hardest-hit by the outbreak worldwide, suffering the majority of deaths and confirmed cases.

Italy, which has the highest death toll worldwide, is also considering how to ease its restrictions. The infection rate there has slowed significantly from the peak of the outbreak, although Mr Conte warned the country still needed to be cautious. ""We need to pick sectors that can restart their activity. If scientists confirm it, we might begin to relax some measures already by the end of this month,â he said. There are widespread concerns, however, about the Easter weekend, when people usually travel to see loved ones. Many countries have launched campaigns appealing for people to stay at home over the long weekend. Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said nice weather was no excuse for gatherings, and said the situation remains âdangerous and deceptive, because the virus has not yet been defeatedâ. Portugal has tightened lockdown measures for Easter, with a ban on people leaving their local area without official documentation. Prime Minister AntÃ³nio Costa has, however, suggested schools could reopen on 4 May.

"The government introduced its lockdown measures two-and-a-half weeks ago People should follow the government's coronavirus rules and stay home over the Easter weekend, as warmer weather is forecast across parts of the UK. Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said the UK was ""just beginning to see this strategy starting to work"" and people needed to ""stick with it"". Temperatures are forecast to reach 25C (77F) in some parts of the country, according to the Met Office. Some police forces have warned of a crackdown on people flouting the rules. It comes as Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab - who is deputising for the prime ministerwhile he continues his treatment in intensive care- chairs a virtual meeting of the emergency Cobra committee to discuss the lockdown measures. The rules, which were brought in on 23 March, are due to be officially reviewed next week. But in Wales, the rules have already been extended, whileScottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon saidit was ""likely"" the lockdown was ""going to be in place for some weeks to come yet"".

He was taken to hospital on Sunday evening after self-isolating with coronavirus symptoms and admitted to intensive care a day later. A total of 7,978 patients have died in hospital after testing positive for coronavirus as of 17:00 BST on Thursday, up by 881 on the previous day. NHS England said 765 people with the virus had died, while in Scotlandanother 81 people died. Wales announced a further 41 deaths and four more people died with the virus in Northern Ireland. Of those who died in England, 43 had no known underlying health condition and were aged between 33 and 99 years old. Among those who have died in recent days is Edmond Adedeji, 62, a doctor at Great Western Hospital in Swindon. Speaking to BBC Breakfast, Mr Dowden appealed for people to stay at home over the Easter weekend. ""This is not how I planned to spend my Easter weekend, I'm sure it's not how any of your viewers planned to spend their Easter weekend,"" he said. ""We'll have to stay at home."" He said it was unlikely that the restrictions would be lifted in any way next week ""given they're just starting to have an effect"". Nicola Sturgeon said she knew following the rules will ""seem even harder over this Easter holiday weekend"". ""Please stay in touch with family, friends and loved ones in whatever alternative way best works for you,"" she said. Adverts across Thursday's newspapers urge the public to ""stay home this bank holiday weekend"" Public benches are taped off in Brockwell Park in London Since the measures were brought in on 23 March, people have been told they can only leave the house for four limited reasons: Shopping for basic necessities; one form of exercise a day; any medical need and travelling to work if you cannot work from home. Police were given powers to enforce the restrictions and have been acting with discretion, with some people receiving fines. What can the police fine you for doing? But the chief of Northamptonshire Police warned the ""three-week grace period is over"" and more people could face fines or a criminal record if they do not stick to those rules. And the assistant chief constable of Devon and Cornwall Police said police officers will patrol roads, adding: ""If we stop vehicles and they are travelling to a second home, we will ask them to return to their primary residence."" Downing Street said the police will have the ""full support"" of government in enforcing the lockdown, adding that individual forces will use their ""discretion"" as to how the measures are enforced. Restrictions, the biggest curtailment of our liberty in our lifetimes, lockdown. Call it what you will - it's not going any time soon. The Welsh government has already said so. So has the Scottish government. And the Culture Secretary at Westminster, Oliver Dowden, has said the evidence points to it ""staying in place"". And Downing Street is at pains to emphasise the importance of social distancing, and not talk about anything else. There have been some private grumbles at Westminster that Cardiff and Edinburgh have been so explicit, so soon, given there are UK-wide discussions about this. But that is to indulge in the minutiae when the big picture is what matters. Should we be surprised the lockdown is going to carry on for some time? No. Yes, the government promised to look at it three weeks in. That means next week. But it was always going to take this long for even the beginnings of evidence that it might be working to start to appear. So across the Easter weekend, and beyond bluntly, we need to get used to this. Ministers, including from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, are looking at evidence from scientists on the impact of the measures at the Cobra meeting. Welsh health minister Vaughan Gething - who is also taking part in the Cobra meeting -said there was ""virtually zero prospect""of government experts advising that it was safe to lift the lockdown. He told BBC Breakfast it was important to be ""straight with the public"", saying that ""if we don't provide a clear message"" then people might be under the impression the lockdown measures might be lifted next week anyway and ""start to act as if the last few days doesn't really matter"".

Cornwall is estimated to have about 13,500 second homes and Assistant Chief Constable Glen Mayhew said his officers would police the roads. ""We understand that people may have second homes in Devon or Cornwall but we urge you not to travel to them,"" he said. Robert Goodwill, Conservative MP for Scarborough and Whitby, said he had been told ""selfish individuals"" were coming to their second home and on holiday to the Yorkshire coast. ""I have been appalled to see so many tourists visiting the Yorkshire coast, with particularly worrying scenes in places like Whitby, where the narrow streets make it impossible to stay apart from other people,"" he said. The government is urging locals and holidaymakers to stay away from beaches Chief Constable of North Wales Police, Carl Foulkes,warned people ""not to take the law into their own hands""after the force received calls about second homes. Earlier, Downing Street said people who were in their second-homes should not travel back to their primary residences now. Several forces have launched online forms for people to report those flouting the rules, while Northamptonshire Police Chief Constable Nick Adderley saida ""three-week grace period"" is over. He warned the force was prepared to issue fines and make arrests. If people continued to flout regulations, patrols may check supermarket trolleys for non-essential shopping and set up road blocks.

"Student union president Helena Schofield wants housing firms to be flexible over rent for absent students Student leaders in England say full rent should not be charged next term on university rooms left empty by the coronavirus shutdown. But in privately run accommodation in Portsmouth, students are being told they must keep paying. What has angered them further is that the block had not been finished in time for the autumn term and students had to be put up in temporary accommodation. Property firm Prime Student Living says students are still obliged to pay. It points out they are still receiving their loans. ""Where the situation is so unprecedented there should be some more understanding,"" says Helena Schofield, president of the National Union of Students at the University of Portsmouth. The student block in Portsmouth was not ready when the academic year began Manisha Singh, who is taking a masters degree in criminal psychology at the university, says she feels like students are being ""walked all over"". She is a resident in Stanhope House, a student housing block managed by Prime Student Living. Because of delays in completing the building she spent most of the first term in temporary accommodation - and now faces a term with the campus closed because of coronavirus. This has been ""upsetting and pressurising"", she says. And she is angry that she has to keep paying rent for a room that will have cost almost Â£10,000 for the year. Universities stop teaching and exams in coronavirus shutdown Students call for rents to be waived Students feel 'cheated' by unfinished housing Student housing failures 'deeply concerning' to minister Yusuf Ahmed, who is studying petroleum engineering, says: ""They asked me to be more flexible when they were delayed."" And now he thinks the property firm should reciprocate and be able to release students from contracts rather than their having to pay until the end of the annual contract in September. Manisha says students should be be able to end their contracts during the coronavirus crisis Eva Crossan Jory, NUS vice-president, says in the exceptional circumstances of the pandemic there is a ""moral duty"" on housing firms to give the ""option of a no-penalty early release from their contracts"". The University of Portsmouth has switched to teaching online and has allowed students in university-owned accommodation to end contracts as many will be studying from home. But it has no control over private student buildings. The university, students' union and local MP Stephen Morgan wrote to private student accommodation firms calling on them to ""do the right thing"" and allow students to end their rental contracts early. But Prime Student Living rejected this and replied: ""Tenancy agreements are to remain in force and students are obligated to continue to pay remaining rent."" The property firm has highlighted that students will be receiving their maintenance loans and so should be able to continue with the contracts they signed. Robert Milne says the student housing sector needs to be more regulated Another student in Stanhope House, Robert Milne, says it is ""very annoying"" to pay rent ""knowing I will never go back to that room"". The building delay that affected Stanhope House was part of a wave of dozens of unfinished building schemes that left students in the lurch last year. Mr Milne, who is studying property development, says the experience makes him think that student accommodation is in need of tighter regulation, because at present ""it's students who are losing out"". ""It's grown so quickly and regulation hasn't kept pace with the expansion,"" he says. The University of Portsmouth is waiving rents next term in its own accommodation Professor Graham Galbraith, vice chancellor of the University of Portsmouth, called on housing providers to let students end contracts and have the ""certainty that they want and need"" at a time of distress and hardship. Across the country it is a mixed picture, with some students able to cancel rent on unoccupied rooms, while others have to keep paying. According to student housing charity, Unipol, about 60 universities in England have agreed to waive rent in university-owned accommodation next term. Others have yet to decide or could make students continue to pay. Much of student accommodation is privately run - and some of these firms are allowing students to stop paying. Unite, one of the biggest private providers, says: ""We will not be collecting any further payments from students who decide they don't want to return for the summer term."" But this depends on students notifying Unite by 17:00 on Monday 13 April. Private housing providers iQ and Scape are also allowing students to end contracts, with a deadline of 17:00 on Thursday 9 April. Martin Blakey, of Unipol, said it was fair for both landlords and tenants to reach a compromise and ""share the pain"". ""No one party [including small landlords as well as the big student property firms] should bear all the loss,"" he said. Universities UK said emergency legislation during the coronavirus outbreak meant all students were ""protected from eviction"", whether renting privately or from a university.

"Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced the measures on Wednesday The government's Â£750m package to support charities through the coronavirus pandemic will not be enough to prevent some being forced to close, organisations have warned. While many charities welcomed the funding, some said more was needed. Charities have seen their income shrink because of enforced shop closures and cancelled fundraising events. Government measures involve cash grants direct to charities providing key services during the crisis. As part of the scheme, announced by Chancellor Rishi Sunak on Wednesday, Â£360m will be directly allocated by government departments to those charities. Another Â£370m will go to small local charities, including those delivering food and essential medicines and providing financial advice. Tens of thousands of charities are expected to benefit, including hospices, St John's Ambulance and services for vulnerable children and domestic abuse victims. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area STRESS:How to look after your mental health Karl Wilding, chief executive of the National Council for Voluntary Organisations, said charities were estimated to lose around Â£4bn in 12 weeks because of the coronavirus outbreak. He said the government funding was ""an important first step"" but ""it will not be enough to prevent good charities around the country from closing their doors"". ""Even many that survive will look very different in a few months' time, with a severely reduced capacity to provide the support that people rely on,"" he added. Macmillan Cancer Support chief executive Lynda Thomas also said the support did not go far enough. ""We are deeply concerned this commitment fails to recognise the scale of the challenge,"" she said. ""It won't prevent many of the nation's charities cutting the support they provide when it is needed most, or even being forced to close."" And children's charity Barnardo's said the package was ""little more than a sticking plaster"". Chief executive Javed Khan said demand for the charity's services was ""skyrocketing"" and urged the government to keep the measures under review. However, Tracey Bleakley, chief executive of Hospice UK, said her organisation was ""delighted"" with the ""unprecedented funding"". Labour's shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds said, while the funding announcement was welcome, ""it falls far short of filling the financial black hole many organisations are facing"". Events such as the London Marathon, which has been postponed, are big earners for charities The government has also promised to match all donations to the BBC's Big Night In fundraising event on 23 April, pledging a minimum of Â£20m. Announcing the measures, Mr Sunak said the government could not match every pound of spending that the UK's 170,000 charities would have received this year. He said charities were also eligible for help throughthe government's job retention scheme, which allows employees to be put on furlough - a leave of absence - with 80% of their wages reimbursed by a grant from the government. But he did acknowledge that this was not an option open to those charities that need to play a particular role in supporting people through the lockdown.

"Staff working for Her Majesty's Passport Office believe their lives are being put at risk because of demands that they return to work. Many have been asked to go back next week, despite the ongoing coronavirus crisis, the BBC has learned. On Tuesday, staff were told by a Home Office scientific adviser 80% of people would get Covid-19 in the end and ""we can't hide away from it forever"". The Home Office said it was maintaining social distancing at passport offices. When and how to get staff back into the workplace are questions employers will increasingly have to grapple with across the UK. Her Majesty's Passport Office (HMPO) has centres in Belfast, Durham, Glasgow, Liverpool, London, Newport and Peterborough. The Tuesday conference call was addressed by Myrtle Lloyd, the HMPO chief operating officer. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area STRESS:How to look after your mental health According to a transcript seen by the BBC, she said government health guidance did not mean that staff ""should stay at home instead of delivering critical services"". ""What is also critical for us as a business is to have a manageable level of work in the system, so that when we start our recovery we are not overwhelmed by our demands,"" she said. Sources at the Public and Commercial Services Union said up to 2,000 staff would be asked to go back in, with 500 in offices at any one time. However, dozens of staff sent messages that they were deeply concerned about returning to work. One wrote: ""Your actions are going to kill people."" Another said: ""If my family die because you insist I need to come to work before the surge passes (having isolated until now), I will pursue a claim against HMPO / Home Office for negligence."" Others questioned how they would get to work without using public transport. New bus safety measures after nine Covid-19 deaths UK construction workers fear for their safety Coronavirus: 'If I stay at home I may be fired' There are also claims among staff and their trade union that advice from a government official at the meeting was out of step with government policy. According to the transcript, the Home Office deputy scientific adviser, Rupert Shute, told those listening that staying at home was important but ""we also have to keep functioning our lives"". ""You are no more at risk at the workplace as you would be in your home or at the supermarket. It is about minimising it,"" he said. ""We are working on the assessment that 80% of us, if we haven't already, will get the virus."" He added: ""We cannot hide away from it forever."" This echoed previous government briefings that up to 80% of people would eventually contract Covid-19 and that this would help the population develop ""herd immunity"". However, that position was sidelined when computer modelling suggested a lockdown would be needed to reduce the infection rate. The Public and Commercial Services Union said his comments were ""extremely irresponsible and totally contradicted current government guidance"". PCS general secretary Mark Serwotka said: ""It is absolutely scandalous that HMPO are suggesting our members can go back into work during a pandemic to process routine passports. ""The cavalier approach to our members' health and safety is shameful and ultimately puts them in greater danger of contracting Covid-19. ""We have already had members die as a result of contracting coronavirus and pressured Civil Service managers in other departments to shut offices so staff can work from home."" A Home Office spokesperson dismissed suggestions the health of staff was being put at risk. In a statement they said: ""Her Majesty's Passport Office is fully adhering to public health advice across all of its offices and adopting social distancing measures to keep both its staff and customers safe. ""It continues to operate at substantially restricted staffing levels with a significant number of people working from home where possible, and staff are prioritising emergency cases. ""Guidance is also available for people who are travelling into work. ""It was made clear in the meeting that the government's priority is slowing the spread of coronavirus and we all have a part to play in order to protect the NHS and save lives."" Passport Office staff have to handle documents and passports sent in from all over the world. One source said they and their colleagues were happy for a skeleton staff to process applications needed for ID purposes, especially when the applicants were doctors or nurses. However, they are now dealing with requests for passports before holidays over Easter, but the shutdown of most air travel meant they were no longer urgent, the source said. A key computer system they use cannot be installed on laptops and security measures make it difficult for operation staff to work from home. The Passport Office is looking for new ways to help them to do so. Have you been asked to return to work? Share your experiences by emailinghaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external.

But it has no control over private student buildings. The university, students' union and local MP Stephen Morgan wrote to private student accommodation firms calling on them to ""do the right thing"" and allow students to end their rental contracts early. But Prime Student Living rejected this and replied: ""Tenancy agreements are to remain in force and students are obligated to continue to pay remaining rent."" The property firm has highlighted that students will be receiving their maintenance loans and so should be able to continue with the contracts they signed. Robert Milne says the student housing sector needs to be more regulated Another student in Stanhope House, Robert Milne, says it is ""very annoying"" to pay rent ""knowing I will never go back to that room"". The building delay that affected Stanhope House was part of a wave of dozens of unfinished building schemes that left students in the lurch last year. Mr Milne, who is studying property development, says the experience makes him think that student accommodation is in need of tighter regulation, because at present ""it's students who are losing out"". ""It's grown so quickly and regulation hasn't kept pace with the expansion,"" he says. The University of Portsmouth is waiving rents next term in its own accommodation Professor Graham Galbraith, vice chancellor of the University of Portsmouth, called on housing providers to let students end contracts and have the ""certainty that they want and need"" at a time of distress and hardship. Across the country it is a mixed picture, with some students able to cancel rent on unoccupied rooms, while others have to keep paying. According to student housing charity, Unipol, about 60 universities in England have agreed to waive rent in university-owned accommodation next term. Others have yet to decide or could make students continue to pay. Much of student accommodation is privately run - and some of these firms are allowing students to stop paying. Unite, one of the biggest private providers, says: ""We will not be collecting any further payments from students who decide they don't want to return for the summer term."" But this depends on students notifying Unite by 17:00 on Monday 13 April. Private housing providers iQ and Scape are also allowing students to end contracts, with a deadline of 17:00 on Thursday 9 April. Martin Blakey, of Unipol, said it was fair for both landlords and tenants to reach a compromise and ""share the pain"". ""No one party [including small landlords as well as the big student property firms] should bear all the loss,"" he said. Universities UK said emergency legislation during the coronavirus outbreak meant all students were ""protected from eviction"", whether renting privately or from a university.

"Coronavirus has now infected more than one million people worldwide, but its impact extends far beyond just those who have had it. Even the frequency of use of the word ""unprecedented"" is unprecedented at the moment. According to Google Trends it's been used three times more over the last two weeks than the highest point recorded previously. As governments around the world have enacted new measures and given official advice, we take a look at the impact that it's had on people and the world around them. The approaches to dealing with coronavirus across the world have been wide-rangingto say the least. In Colombia the days that you're allowed to leave the house depend on the number of your national ID card; in Serbia a designated dog-walking hour was introduced; and in Belarus the president has gone against medical advice, recommending vodka and saunas as a way to stay safe. Some of the more common approaches have seen governments issue recommendations on social distancing for part or all of the country, while others have acted to restrict all non-essential internal movement. The latter is often called a lockdown. When the virus was first identified in China in late 2019, lockdown seemed extreme. But as the outbreak has spread around the world, it has become more difficult to manage. More countries have opted to take the strictest measures possible to contain it. Well over 100 countries worldwide had instituted either a full or partial lockdown by the end of March 2020, affecting billions of people. And many others had recommended restricted movement for some or all of their citizens. In regions that have only recently confirmed their first cases of coronavirus, many countries appear to be learning from their Asian and European counterparts. Governments seem to be acting faster and more strictly in Africa as well. China has managed to ease its restrictions after passing through the worst period of climbing cases and deaths, but life is still far from normal. The rest of us may have a long way to go. When the virus first appeared, several countries brought in initial restrictions on flights from China, or required visitors from at-risk areas to be quarantined on arrival. After it had been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization, on 11 March, there were more all-encompassing measures. President Trump blocked all non-essential arrivals to the US from the European Union on 15 March, and a day later the EU did the same to all visitors from outside the Schengen free-travel zone. By the end of March, air traffic from some of the world's biggest airports had dropped to a fraction of what it was at the same time last year, or even what it was at the start of this month. The number of commercial flights last month was down by more than a quarter globally,according to flight tracking service Flightradar24,external. In the final week of March, as more and more countries introduced travel restrictions to try to contain the virus, traffic declined 63% from the same period last year. On 25 March, Heathrow - one of the busiest airports in the world serving about 80 million passengers per year - recorded more than 1,000 fewer flights compared with an equivalent day in 2019. It's not just getting from city to city. Travel within major cities across the globe has ground to a halt as restrictions on movement and social contact have come into force. As of 31 March, residents in cities like Madrid, Paris, London and New York were making fewer than one-tenth as many journeys using the app as they did normally, according to data from travel app Citymapper. In Milan in northern Italy, which has been locked down for several weeks now, only 3% of trips were being planned via the Citymapper mobile app, compared with before the outbreak. The data also suggests that people cut down on travel in the days leading up to government-enforced shutdowns. For example, the partial lockdown in Sao Paulo, Brazil's most populous city, came into place on 24 March but trips had already declined sharply the week before. Even in cities where authorities have issued recommendations on social distancing and refrained from imposing strict lockdowns, it appears that people are still restricting their travel. ln Stockholm, Sweden, where the government has avoided draconian measures, issuing guidelines rather than strict rules, the Citymapper data suggests planned trips - which can include both walking and public transport - fell by 70%. Stockholm's public transport company reported last week that passenger numbers on subway and commuter trains had halved. Movement is also below normal rates in some of the Asian cities that Citymapper collects data for, like Hong Kong and Singapore, which have not enforced the type of shutdowns seen elsewhere. The South Korean capital Seoul hasn't come to a standstill like European capitals, despite facing huge numbers of coronavirus cases - a sign of the country's decision to focus on widespread testing and contact tracing rather than social distancing. We see the same behaviour with people on the roads. Major cities around the world were already becoming steadily less busy before official lockdown measures came in, congestion data from location technology specialists TomTom shows. In Tokyo there hasn't been an official lockdown yet, but schools have been shut since the beginning of March. That, and a lack of tourists, could explain why traffic there has been marginally below last year's levels without the sharp downturn obvious elsewhere. In Jakarta, Indonesia, where there has also been no official lockdown, congestion has already dropped to almost zero - similar to Los Angeles and New Delhi which shut down on different dates. The congestion score in the graphic below is an indication of how much longer it would take to make a journey through the city compared with when there is no traffic at all. A rating of 50 means that a trip will take 50% more time than it would if the roads were completely free, for example, so a half-hour drive would become 45 minutes. The regular low points on the chart generally come at weekends. In China there are signs that things are beginning to get back to normal. Traffic levels are back to about half the 2019 level in Beijing and Shanghai but have been steadily growing since the beginning of February following extended Chinese New Year celebrations from 25 January. In Wuhan, where the outbreak originated, traffic levels are still next to zero compared with last year. One of the few positive effects of the shutdown is that there seems to have been a drop in pollution in some parts of the world. Levels of NO2 in the atmosphere fluctuate widely with factors like wind speed, and satellites trying to measure these levels can be hampered by cloud cover. This may explain some of the variability seen over Wuhan and northern Italy between January and March 2019 in the maps below. But in these places, shutdowns have been stricter and in place for longer than elsewhere, and the change in NO2 levels between 2019 and the months of 2020 in which the shutdowns have been in effect appears to be significant. In the UK, and in many other places, the available satellite data does not yet show either way whether the ongoing reduction in economic activity is being accompanied by a corresponding fall in emissions, althoughsome other sourcessuggest that it is. As countries have shut down, many workers have had to try to continue their office jobs from home. That means video calls and instant messaging have become invaluable workroom tools. The average number of messages sent by users in New York, Paris, London and Berlin has increased by more than a third in just a few weeks. Not everyone has got used to their new ways of working just yet. But - depending on where you are - there could be a good deal of time left to do so.

"The police's role in the coronavirus pandemic is simple: to ensure we follow national lockdown restrictions. But in practice, that is a huge challenge for officers who are being asked to monitor behaviour that, until March last year, was perfectly legal. Police chiefs have followed a system called ""The Four Es"". Before fines are issued to rule-breakers, police will first: Engage with people, to ask why they appear to be breaking the rules Explain the law, stressing the risks to public health and the NHS Encourage them to change their behaviour The fourth ""E"" is ""Enforce"" by issuing penalty notices, as a last resort. Covid rule-breakers are now ""increasingly likely"" to be finedby officers, the Metropolitan Police commissioner Dame Cressida Dick has said. The police have a legal duty to make sure the rules are enforced, alongside council, environmental health and trading standards officers. Postcode check: Find out the rules where you live If you break coronavirus regulations, you could get a fixed penalty notice , the Covid equivalent of a traffic offence like speeding. Since March, 32,000 have been issued in England and Wales. Penalties rose sharply during England's November lockdown. Almost 6,500 penalty tickets were handed out as police moved more quickly to enforcement. In England and Northern Ireland fines start at Â£200. Fines start at Â£60in Wales,external, andin Scotland,external, although this is reduced to Â£30 if paid within 28 days. Large parties can also be shut down by the police - with fines of up to Â£10,000. In extreme circumstances, you could be prosecuted and face an even greater fine imposed by a court. Hundreds of people were caught on a drone camera at an illegal party by West Midlands Police Yes. All of England is now in a ""tier four"" national lockdown, with similar measures in place across the rest of the UK. Under the new lockdown law, you must stay at home unless you have a ""reasonable excuse"" to be outside. Your home includes property such as a garden, shed or garage - and also access to it. The government's lockdown guidance sets outexamples of reasonable excuses,external. Police won't fine you for leaving home to go shopping for essential goods, or to use a business that can remain open, or for going to work or education, training or childcare. There are other reasonable excuses - such as helping other people in their moment of need. Police chiefs are telling frontline officers to use their judgement if they come across a situation not defined in the regulations. If you want to take part in a protest, the law does not define that as a reasonable excuse to leave home. There is, however, an exception for joining a picket as part of lawful industrial action. Exercise is one of the reasonable excuses for being outside in a public space. You cannot be fined for exercising. But there has been enormous confusion since last March over how long people could exercise for. Cabinet Minister Michael Gove pronounced that spring that he thought half an hour was enough. There are also questions over how far you can go to exercise. Boris Johnson has beencriticised for travelling seven miles from Downing Streetto go cycling during lockdown. There are no restrictions in law in England on how you exercise and for how long. You cannot exercise in groups, but you can run or go on a wander with someone else from your household, support bubble or one person you don't live with. The government's Covid guidance for exercise explains that law - andmixes it with a non-legal recommendation,externalto only go out once a day - and to stay local. It says local ""means stay in the village, town, or part of the city where you live"", but that has no legal force. Derbyshire Police have been taking the ""stay local"" principle seriously. Officers have issued tickets to people who drive five miles to their local beauty spot - includingtwo women accused of an illegal picnicbecause they were carrying takeaway cups of tea. They might. This refers to the ban on ""gatherings"". The last-but-one version of the restrictions made it a potential crime to ""mingle"". That language has now gone from the law - but the rules are far stricter. While the law in England doesn't criminalise bumping into someone in the street, you can no longer meet anyone socially - other than those in your household, support bubble or people you care for. The Home Office has given the police an extra Â£30m to pay for Covid patrols in England and Wales. Over Christmas there were more than 800 fines for what Home Secretary Priti Patel says were ""egregious"" breaches of the rules. The National Police Chiefs' Council hasn't abandoned the Four Es - but expect more fines and more officers asking people what they are doing. Leicester woman fined for Wales trip to see horse Group fined for playing dominoes in restaurant Border police patrols to double after travel ban Police patrols were stepped up around the Scotland-England border around Christmas For instance, the Metropolitan Police has told officers to issue fines ""more quickly"" to anyone committing obvious, wilful and serious breaches. Derbyshire Police, who famouslyput a drone up over hikersin the first lockdown, has issued a similar warning. Yes - while in shops and on public transport. You could face a fixed penalty notice if you don't. What are the rules for face masks or face coverings? If you have returned from an overseas Covid hotspot, or have been told by the NHS Test and Trace system to stay at home, you must quarantine for 10 days. The police can now check the NHS Test and Trace database to investigate a tip-off about a quarantine-breaker. Police won't get to see your personal health records.

"Flour has been in short supply in supermarkets With the nation confined to their homes amid the coronavirus lockdown, a rise in home baking appears to be contributing to shortages of flour on supermarket shelves. Grocery sales of flour were up 92% in the four weeks to 22 March compared to the same period last year, according to consumer analysts Kantar. The National Association of British and Irish Millers (Nabim) says the industry is ""working round the clock"", milling flour 24 hours a day, seven days a week to double production - but is still struggling to meet demand. At Wessex Mill in Oxfordshire, the family business is running at 24-hour operation for the first time in its 125-year history. Record traffic to their online shop has also forced them to close it down and only open for 10 minutes a day. ""It's unprecedented,"" says Emily Munsey, who runs the mill with her father. ""We've increased production about four-fold but we're nowhere close to meeting the demand we've seen."" After losing about 15% of their staff because they are self-isolating the business has even recruited local people who are out of work because of the lockdown, including builders and chefs, to replenish its workforce. Emily Munsey has been working 12 hour shifts to try and keep up with demand Alex Waugh, director general of Nabim, says the issue isn't being able to mill enough flour - but the lack of capacity to pack it into small bags for retailers. Only around 4% of UK flour is sold through shops and supermarkets, according to the association. The majority is produced in bulk and delivered in tankers or bags of more than 16kg to bakeries or other food manufacturers. However, since the coronavirus outbreak, Nabim says ordinary shoppers have been purchasing much more flour than normal - with existing stocks quickly used up. Mr Waugh says packing lines are now running at maximum capacity but this is only enough for 15% of households to buy a bag of flour per week - and existing packing lines can't easily be adapted to produce smaller retail bags. One option the industry is considering is the possibility of shops selling larger bags - as it is better equipped to produce in bulk. However, Mr Waugh says that could be some way off and for now it's just a question of waiting for demand to reduce enough for stock levels to be rebuilt. Coronavirus: How do I get a food parcel? Why are people stockpiling toilet paper? Buy responsibly and think of others, shoppers told So why the sudden increase in demand? As well as the public generally stocking up on non-perishable goods amid the lockdown, a rise in home baking also appears to be a factor. At Wessex Mill, Ms Munsey says they have been overwhelmed by members of the public ringing up trying to source flour for recipes. ""We've had to get an extra person in the office and take down the phone number from our website because we were getting so many people who normally buy flour in the supermarkets ringing round flour mills,"" she says. Online searches for bread and cake recipes have surged since mid-March, when restrictions on life in the UK first began to be introduced,according to Google Trends,external. And BBC Food has seen record traffic since the start of the lockdown, including a 540% increase to its banana bread recipe - the site's most popular recipe at the moment. Traffic to its basic bread recipe is also up 875% and as stocks have depleteda page on how to make bread without yeast or bread flourhas seen a surge in popularity. Katherine has been baking with her daughter Beatrix Katherine Rhodes, 36, is one of those who has turned to baking to keep her two young children occupied at home. Living in a rural part of Essex, there is no shop nearby so making her own supplies was also a way to avoid leaving the house as much as possible. Like others, she's had trouble getting hold of flour - but managed to source some from her local bakery. ""They put out a message on social media two days ago saying they were going to source flour direct from the mill and divvy it out to local residents,"" says Katherine. ""The response was astounding,"" she adds, with the bakery overwhelmed with interest. Zoe and her son have been enjoying freshly baked bread every couple of days Zoe Lacey has also taken up baking to fill her time during the lockdown. The 36-year-old had never made bread in her life - but when she couldn't find any in her local shop last week she decided to try making her own. ""It was the most delicious bread I've ever had so we're hooked,"" says Zoe, who is now on her fifth loaf. ""I managed to find the last bag of flour on the shelf last week so I'm hoping I'll be able to find more on my next shop - otherwise my bread journey might be over!""

"The government introduced its lockdown measures two-and-a-half weeks ago People should follow the government's coronavirus rules and stay home over the Easter weekend, as warmer weather is forecast across parts of the UK. Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said the UK was ""just beginning to see this strategy starting to work"" and people needed to ""stick with it"". Temperatures are forecast to reach 25C (77F) in some parts of the country, according to the Met Office. Some police forces have warned of a crackdown on people flouting the rules. It comes as Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab - who is deputising for the prime ministerwhile he continues his treatment in intensive care- chairs a virtual meeting of the emergency Cobra committee to discuss the lockdown measures. The rules, which were brought in on 23 March, are due to be officially reviewed next week. But in Wales, the rules have already been extended, whileScottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon saidit was ""likely"" the lockdown was ""going to be in place for some weeks to come yet"".

He was taken to hospital on Sunday evening after self-isolating with coronavirus symptoms and admitted to intensive care a day later. A total of 7,978 patients have died in hospital after testing positive for coronavirus as of 17:00 BST on Thursday, up by 881 on the previous day. NHS England said 765 people with the virus had died, while in Scotlandanother 81 people died. Wales announced a further 41 deaths and four more people died with the virus in Northern Ireland. Of those who died in England, 43 had no known underlying health condition and were aged between 33 and 99 years old. Among those who have died in recent days is Edmond Adedeji, 62, a doctor at Great Western Hospital in Swindon. Speaking to BBC Breakfast, Mr Dowden appealed for people to stay at home over the Easter weekend. ""This is not how I planned to spend my Easter weekend, I'm sure it's not how any of your viewers planned to spend their Easter weekend,"" he said. ""We'll have to stay at home."" He said it was unlikely that the restrictions would be lifted in any way next week ""given they're just starting to have an effect"". Nicola Sturgeon said she knew following the rules will ""seem even harder over this Easter holiday weekend"". ""Please stay in touch with family, friends and loved ones in whatever alternative way best works for you,"" she said. Adverts across Thursday's newspapers urge the public to ""stay home this bank holiday weekend"" Public benches are taped off in Brockwell Park in London Since the measures were brought in on 23 March, people have been told they can only leave the house for four limited reasons: Shopping for basic necessities; one form of exercise a day; any medical need and travelling to work if you cannot work from home. Police were given powers to enforce the restrictions and have been acting with discretion, with some people receiving fines. What can the police fine you for doing? But the chief of Northamptonshire Police warned the ""three-week grace period is over"" and more people could face fines or a criminal record if they do not stick to those rules. And the assistant chief constable of Devon and Cornwall Police said police officers will patrol roads, adding: ""If we stop vehicles and they are travelling to a second home, we will ask them to return to their primary residence."" Downing Street said the police will have the ""full support"" of government in enforcing the lockdown, adding that individual forces will use their ""discretion"" as to how the measures are enforced. Restrictions, the biggest curtailment of our liberty in our lifetimes, lockdown. Call it what you will - it's not going any time soon. The Welsh government has already said so. So has the Scottish government. And the Culture Secretary at Westminster, Oliver Dowden, has said the evidence points to it ""staying in place"". And Downing Street is at pains to emphasise the importance of social distancing, and not talk about anything else. There have been some private grumbles at Westminster that Cardiff and Edinburgh have been so explicit, so soon, given there are UK-wide discussions about this. But that is to indulge in the minutiae when the big picture is what matters. Should we be surprised the lockdown is going to carry on for some time? No. Yes, the government promised to look at it three weeks in. That means next week. But it was always going to take this long for even the beginnings of evidence that it might be working to start to appear. So across the Easter weekend, and beyond bluntly, we need to get used to this. Ministers, including from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, are looking at evidence from scientists on the impact of the measures at the Cobra meeting. Welsh health minister Vaughan Gething - who is also taking part in the Cobra meeting -said there was ""virtually zero prospect""of government experts advising that it was safe to lift the lockdown. He told BBC Breakfast it was important to be ""straight with the public"", saying that ""if we don't provide a clear message"" then people might be under the impression the lockdown measures might be lifted next week anyway and ""start to act as if the last few days doesn't really matter"".

"A former BBC journalist described as a central character at Westminster and master of interviewing politicians on the street has died aged 61. Paul Lambert, affectionately known as ""Gobby"", was often heard on TV shouting questions at ministers. He left the BBC in 2014 to become communications director of UKIP. His daughter Danni said on Facebook the family were ""devastated"". BBC Head of Westminster Katy Searle called him an ""institution at Westminster"". ""His fearless approach to political doorsteps made politicians cower and journalist colleagues cheer,"" she added. ""We are all deeply saddened by the news and send our very best wishes to his family."" BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg described Mr Lambert as a ""fixture of politics"". Writing on Twitter, she added he was a ""friend of everyone for so long - such sad, sad news"". Former BBC colleagues and journalists from rival broadcasters, as well as some of the politicians he pursued, have taken to social media to pay tribute to his tenacity, kindness and unerring nose for a story. BBC journalist James Landale, who worked with Mr Lambert for many years at Westminster, called him ""a BBC legend, a one man institution, the best fixer in the business"". Allow Twitter content?

Based on Downing Street, Mr Lambert's voice was heard on countless news reports putting ministers on the spot as they went about their business. The nickname ""Gobby"" was a reference to his booming voice, which he used to project awkward questions towards politicians as they entered cars or walked down the street, known in broadcasting as a ""doorstep"". ""The point really is to fill in the pieces of the TV bulletin piece that you haven't got pictures to fill in. You know someone isn't going to say anything, you just need something to happen,""Mr Lambert explained in 2013.

"A plant charity is predicting a boost for wild flowers because some councils have stopped mowing verges and parks during the Covid-19 crisis. Plantlife has been urging councils for years to cut grass less often. It also wants them to delay cutting until flowers have had chance to seed. The charity says it has seen a shift in attitudes in recent years, but some councillors still say their citizens prefer neatly-manicured lawns and verges. Now Plantlifeâs preliminary research suggests that municipal mowing has been among the first activities to be cut under the crisis. Thatâs partly because staff are sick or self-isolating, and partly to save money as budgets are squeezed. Plantlifeâs Trevor Dines told BBC News that an upsurge in public support for wild flower verges had already persuaded some authorities to restrict cutting. Emptying bins Support for wild flower verges had already persuaded some authorities to restrict cutting He said that a search of local authority websites and social media suggested that more councils are now being jolted into a policy change so they can re-deploy ground staff to services such as emptying bins. He said: âWe have seen an upsurge in members of the public complaining that their councils are cutting the daisies. These sort of comments used to be outweighed by people complaining about untidy grass verges, but it seems as though the balance has shifted. âObviously weâre extremely worried about the Covid crisis and want it to end as quickly as possible. But if councils do change their methods because of the crisis, they might find it wins public support, which would be good for the future.â Among the councils registering changes due to the Covid crisis are: LincolnshireâGrass cutting and litter picking are amongnon-essential services being scaled back.â,external FlintshireâAll Council operated grounds maintenance, grass cutting and horticultural operationswill be suspended until further notice.â,external Stockton-on-Tees BoroughâGrass cutting will be restricted to minimum levels with the exception of areas where it is needed to ensure public safety â for example, tomaintain lines of sight at road junctions.â,external Newcastleâ âGrass cutting and shrub bed maintenancewill cease for the time being.â,external Wiganâ âThe maintenance of non-essential grass cutting will be suspended for the foreseeable future. We have acted swiftly toredeploy staff to frontline services,external, such as bin collections.â Plantlife wants councils to delay cutting until the end of August or the start of September until after plants have seeded. Meanwhile, the reduction of traffic during the Covid-19 crisis willproduce another benefit for wild flowers. Typically, roadside verges are drenched with nitrogen emissions from vehicle exhausts. This fertilises the hardier species in the plant world, which can harness the nitrogen to grow and out-compete more delicate wild flowers. Mr Dines said: âThere has been a phenomenal change in the quality of air â we can see so much more clearly into the distance. The lack of pollutants is going to help wildflowers on verges.â Follow Rogeron Twitter.,external Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser Locals find homes reduced to ash as fears grow of more fierce winds spreading LA fires Climate 'whiplash' linked to raging LA fires Watch: The moment five US presidents gather at Jimmy Carter's funeral The '9/11 mastermind' is set to plead guilty.

"The Mandalorian featuring Ming-Na Wen is a Disney+ offering Disney's new video streaming service has reached more than 50 million subscribers since its launch five months ago. When Disney Plus last announced viewing figures in February it had reached 26.5 million subscribers. Since then, this has almost doubled as more people are online and stuck at home due to virus clampdowns. Disney Plus, which rivals Netflix and Amazon Prime, rolled out to the UK and other parts of Europe last month. All three streaming platforms are enjoying a huge boost in viewing figures as cinemas remain closed and people are forced to stay indoors. Will virus lockdowns change the way we watch films? What can we expect from the huge Disney+ launch? Most UK cinemas shut after virus advice Disney Plus originally set a target of 60 million to 90 million subscribers by the end of fiscal 2024, when it was first launched in the US in November. ""We're truly humbled that Disney Plus is resonating with millions around the globe,"" said Kevin Mayer, a Disney spokesman. When asked what effect lockdowns and stay-at-home restrictions were having on subscription numbers, Disney refused to comment. ""With movie theatres closed across many key international markets, streaming has instantly become a go-to source for quality in-home entertainment and these services will continue to benefit with a boost in subscribers for a significant time to come as many consumers alter their habits,"" predicts Gitesh Pandya, editor of BoxOfficeGuru.com. Disney Plus subscription figures were given a boost by its audience in India, where the streaming service was launched last week. Disney reported eight million new subscribers in India. After the announcement on Wednesday evening, shares in Disney jumped 7% on Wall Street. The entertainment group has been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic, having to close its theme parks across the globe. It has also had to stop production on new content and delay releases for potential blockbusters like Mulan and Black Widow. Disney Plus is still behind both Netflix and Amazon Prime Video in terms of global subscriptions. Netflix added almost nine million net global subscribers during the fourth quarter of 2019. At the end of last year, it had over 167 million paying subscribers globally. Amazon now has more than 150 million viewers. But Disney Plus, which includes films and TV shows from Disney, Pixar, Star Wars and National Geographic, has grown much faster than its rivals. ""What Disney Plus has achieved in five months took Netflix seven years,"" said Chris Fenton, a movie industry analyst. ""Disney Plus possesses all the ammunition needed to surpass Netflix, and it also has the potential bazooka of China. If any American streaming service can gain access to the 1.4 billion people of China, it's Disney Plus.""

"Chancellor Rishi Sunak has announced a Â£750m package to keep struggling charities afloat during the coronavirus pandemic. The move follows concern that some charities are facing collapse, with income shrinking because of enforced shop closures. Bigger charities such as Oxfam and Age UK have furloughed two-thirds of staff. The measures involve cash grants direct to charities providing key services during the crisis. As part of the scheme, Â£360m will be directly allocated by government departments to those charities. Another Â£370m will go to small local charities, including those delivering food and essential medicines and providing financial advice. Announcing the move, Mr Sunak said the government could not match every pound of spending that the UK's 170,000 charities would have received this year. He also said charities were eligible for help through the government's job retention scheme. However, he said the government wanted to help the charities that were ""on the front line of fighting the coronavirus"". ""Shutting up shop at this moment would contravene their very purpose,"" he added. Mr Sunak also said the government would match all donations to the BBC's Big Night In fundraising event on 23 April, pledging a minimum of Â£20m. ""We need the gentleness of charity in our lives,"" he said. Jeff Kennedy has been using his own money to sustain the charity he runs Charity organiser Jeff Kennedy, who runs the Community First Aid Corps in Morecambe, says he has yet to study the details of the Treasury's plan, but that his organisation urgently needs help. In normal times, his six-person team provides first aid cover at public events in exchange for donations, but a string of cancellations has left the charity on the brink of going bust. Mr Kennedy said his team had found a new role in the community by collecting shopping for vulnerable people and walking their dogs, but income had dried up, while accommodation and utility bills still needed to be paid. ""We don't know whether we'll be able to come through this,"" Mr Kennedy told the BBC. ""I've been using my life savings, putting money in out of my own pocket, for a few weeks now, just to keep us afloat."" In the run-up to Mr Sunak's announcement, charities including the St John Ambulance Association had warned that they could go bust unless they received state aid. The ambulance association will now receive assistance as part of the package, as will hospices, Citizens Advice and charities dealing with vulnerable children and victims of domestic abuse. Sir John Low, chief executive of the Charities Aid Foundation, said the set of measures from the Treasury would ""offer important and welcome support for civil society at this very difficult time for us all"". But there was still ""a long way to go"", he added. ""Recognising the humbling generosity of the British public right now is so vital as we rally together in the face of such a national challenge,"" he said. Shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds said: ""While this announcement is welcome, it falls far short of filling the financial black hole many organisations are facing. ""Ministers should continue to look at what additional measures can be made available. ""We must also see concerted action to guarantee this support can get to charities swiftly, to prevent further damage being done.""

"The US has the highest number of recorded coronavirus cases in the world The US recorded the most coronavirus deaths in a single day with more than 1,800 fatalities reported on Tuesday. It brings the total number of deaths in the country to nearly 13,000, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The US has more than 402,000 confirmed cases, the highest number in the world. Global cases have exceeded 1.4 million. However during a news conference President Donald Trump said the US might be getting to the top of the ""curve"". Meanwhile the city of Wuhan in China, where the infection first emerged,ended its 11-week lockdown. LIVE: Wuhan's 11-week lockdown finally ends This video can not be played Learn how Wuhan dealt with the lockdown The new figures announced on Tuesday are up on the previous record of 1,344 which was recorded on 4 April. But a revised forecast released on Wednesday by the University of Washington has predicted a lower total death count in the US, estimating that around 60,000 Americans could die from Covid-19. The family of American singer-songwriter John Prine has confirmed his death from complications related to coronavirus. Many musicians have paid tribute to John Prine who died on Tuesday from complications related to coronavirus Known for songs such as Angel from Montgomery and Sam Stone, Prine died in Nashville on Tuesday at the age of 73.  His wife tested positive for coronavirus and recovered however Prine was hospitalised last month with symptoms and placed on a ventilator. A number of musicians including Bruce Springsteen and Margo Price have paid tribute to him. A large proportion of the deaths announced were from New York state. Widely considered the epicentre of the outbreak,it recorded 779 deaths on Tuesday. New York City has seen over 4,000 deaths thus far. It is on the cusp of overtaking the entire country of Italy with its number of confirmed cases. Governor Andrew Cuomo said the state appeared to be nearing the peak of its pandemic. Hospital and intensive care admissions were down. ""If we stop what we are doing you will see that curve change,"" the governor cautioned. ""That curve is purely a function of what we do day in and day out."" This video can not be played How caravans are helping frontline medics with a place to stay The governor urged people to stay inside and continue with social distancing. ""I know it's hard but we have to keep doing it,"" he said. New Yorkers have been told to avoid large gatherings as Passover and Easter approaches. Mr Cuomo also announced that New York would allow residents to vote in the June Democratic primary election by mail, saying: ""New Yorkers shouldn't have to choose between their health and their civic duty.""

It was thought that as many as 240,000 people in the US could die in the pandemic, according to the president's task force. He also said the US might be getting to the top of the ""curve"" of the outbreak. Mr Trump said the US could see fewer deaths than predicted During the briefing, he also attacked the World Health Organization (WHO), saying it had issued bad advice and had been too focused on China. ""The WHO really blew it. For some reason, funded largely by the United States, yet very China centric,"" he said. He also said the US would be withholding money meant for the WHO. The United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres addressed Mr Trump's comments through a spokesman on Wednesday. ""The World Health Organization must be supported as it is absolutely critical to the world's efforts to win the war against Covid-19,"" the spokesman said. ""Once we finally turn the page on this epidemic must be a time to look back fully to understand to understand how such a disease emerged and spread its devastation so quickly across the globe, and how all those involved reacted to the crisisâ¦Now is not that time.""

"US President Donald Trump said the World Health Organization has got the pandemic ""wrong"" UK PM Boris Johnson remained in intensive care but is sitting up and engaging with clinical team, Rishi Sunak says Total number of deaths in UK hospitals from coronavirus rose to more than 7,100 - a record increase of 938 in a day Â£750m to be split between small local charities, including hospices, and bigger organisations like Oxfam and Age UK Deaths in Spain rise for a second consecutive day, to 14,792 There are more than 1.5 million confirmed cases worldwide Chinese city of Wuhan, where outbreak began, allows people to leave for first time since lockdown began in January Edited by Lauren Turner and Alix Kroeger That's it for our Wednesday live page coverage. Here's a look at some of the most significant developments from around the globe:  We'll be back with further coverage on Thursday. In his briefing, Trump addressed ""this evil beast"" of a disease, while maintaining an optimistic outlook for Americans who ""keep on fighting to victory"". What else did he say today? Tara McKelveyBBC News, Washington On Wednesday, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) experts offered the kind of guidance that the president likes to hear. The CDC experts said that healthy individuals who have been exposed to someone with the virus can go back to work if they wear a mask, take their temperature twice daily and heed other precautions. Previously these healthy individuals had been told they should quarantine themselves for two weeks. Speaking in the White House briefing room, a place where some journalists are now wearing masks, the CDCâs Robert Redfield explained that the guidance applies to those who work in âcriticalâ fields such as healthcare. He spoke with guarded optimism about the individuals who will be able to work again, looking to the future when others will also be able to return to offices, factories and other work sites, too. The president has been gunning for the US to return to normal, and the new CDC guidelines get one step closer to his goal. Vice-President Mike Pence has urged African Americans to abide by social distancing guidelines after data showed how disproportionately black communities have been harmed by the coronavirus. ""To all of our African-American family members, now more than ever, practise the guidelines,"" he says. ""Look after those most vulnerable.â The White House task force will meet on Thursday with African-American leaders, Pence said. Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, echoed the vice-president's plea to the African-American community to focus on virus mitigation. Stark US statisticshave underscored the heavy toll of coronavirus on black Americans. The president - who has described himself as a wartime leader during the coronavirus emergency - adopts the kind of stirring tone one usually only hears from him in a campaign speech or State of the Union address. ""The daring and determination of our people in this crisis reminds us that no matter how hard it gets, no matter what obstacles we must overcome, Americans will keep on fighting to victory and we will secure the glorious future that our citizens so richly deserve, especially after going through this nightmare, this evil beast."" Trump says his administration has begun distributing the drug hydroxychloroquine in ""large amounts"". He says there are 30 million doses in the national stockpile. Trump has touted the drug as a potential treatment for the novel coronavirus, though studies are inconclusive. Tablets containing chloroquine have long been used in the treatment of malaria, and there is hope that they can inhibit the virus that causes Covid-19. ""I hope it works,"" Trump says. ""Iâm not a doctor but Iâm a person with common sense."" So what is this drug,and does it really work? Trump responds to reports that his son-in-law Jared Kushner is developing a national coronavirus tracking system for patients who have been diagnosed. ""It doesn't sound like a bad idea, actually, but I haven't heard about it,"" Trump says. ""I have to see it."" ""It sounds very scientific... but it also has to do with rights and lots of different constitutional questions."" ""I would have known about it,"" he adds. Trump claims that the World Health Organization has gotten the pandemic ""wrong"". The WHO must ""get its priorities right"", he says, adding that the US is going to do ""a study, investigation"" to determine if it will continue to fund the agency. ""Everybody has to be treated properly,"" Trump says, ""and it doesnât seem that way"", as he repeats his assertion that China is unfairly favoured by the global body. The comments continue a spat between the US president and the WHO. On Wednesday, appearing to call out Trump, Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus defended the WHO's work and called for an end to the politicisation of Covid-19. Also answering questions on Wednesday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that the administration was âreevaluating our funding with respect to the World Health Organizationâ âOrganisations have to work. They have to deliver the outcomes for which they were intended,â Pompeo said.  Trump says his government is ""eliminating bureaucratic barriers"" for ventilators and masks. ""We will permanently produce enough ventilators in the future,"" Trump says. ""Weâre going to have a big stockpile when weâre finished.""
