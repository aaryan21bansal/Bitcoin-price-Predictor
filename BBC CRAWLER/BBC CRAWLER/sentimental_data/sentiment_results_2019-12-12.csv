"This video can not be played New CCTV of Jersey City shooters A gun attack on a Jewish supermarket in New Jersey is being investigated as domestic terrorism driven by anti-Semitism and hatred of police, officials say. The FBI is now overseeing the investigation into the attack in Jersey City, where four people were killed. Police shot two suspected attackers after a four-hour standoff. The suspects were identified as David Anderson, 47, and Francine Graham, 50. ""The evidence points towards acts of hate,"" state Attorney General Gurbir Grewal said. ""We are investigating this matter as potential acts of domestic terror, fuelled both by anti-Semitism and anti-law enforcement beliefs."" The threat of rising anti-Semitism He said the attackers had only fired on people in the supermarket and police officers. ""You can see clearly from the video that the individuals that engaged, the cowards that took down those innocent victims, engaged only with folks in that store and the law enforcement community,"" Mr Grewal said. ""You can see people that walked by, they didn't target them."" Mr Grewal said a pipe bomb had been recovered from the suspects' van, which had been equipped with bulletproof panels, along with five guns. Investigators had found a note at the scene, he added, but nothing that could be described as a manifesto had been found. Officials believe the suspects acted alone. US media have reported that one of the suspects had made anti-Semitic and anti-police social media posts online before the attack. At least one of the suspects appeared to be interested in a group called the Black Hebrew Israelites, whose believers say they are the true descendents of ancient Israelites, officials said. The group is listed by the Southern Poverty Law Center as a hate group. But Mr Grewal said no official link with the group had been established. Earlier Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop tweeted that ""hate and anti-Semitism"" had no place in the city. ""I think as more info comes out it will be more and more clear not only that this was a hate crime but that the perpetrators had hoped to kill many more people than four,"" he said. The violence began at a cemetery about one mile (1.6km) away from the grocery store. The pair killed Detective Joseph Seals, 39, who approached them for questioning about the murder of an Uber driver over the weekend, investigators said. Thy fled the scene in the van and drove to the kosher supermarket at 12:20 local time (17:20 GMT) where they held off armed police and federal officials for four hours, shooting off hundreds of rounds of ammunition. The attackers had opened fire on the shop before entering, alerting two officers on foot patrol who began firing at the suspects until they were injured by the attackers' gunfire. Mr Fulop told reporters that street cameras showed two people ""slowly"" drive towards the market, then ""calmly open the door with two long rifles and begin firing from the street"" into the shop. The incident ended just before 16:00 when officials used an armoured vehicle to ram through the front entrance of the shop and found the bodies of the attackers. The attack put approximately 30,000 students on lockdown, unable to leave their classrooms for hours after the school day had ended. The three victims inside the shop were killed soon after the gunfire broke out, but one managed to escape after being injured. They have been identified by New Jersey officials as Mindy Ferencz, 32; Miguel Douglas, 49; and Moshe Deutch, 24. ""Mindel Ferencz, may she rest in peace, was a pioneer,"" said Rabbi David Niederman, who first confirmed the death of the mother of five. ""She was a lady full of love for others,"" he added. ""Unfortunately, her life was cut so short."" Ferencz's mother told the New York Times that her husband, who owned the supermarket, had taken a break from work to go to a nearby synagogue minutes before shots rang out. Moshe Deutch, 24 Deutsch's death was also confirmed by Rabbi Niederman, who hailed him as a student who had worked to organise a food drive that provided help to 2,000 families each year. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio called the attack a ""hate crime"" and an ""act of terror"", and ordered police to be on high alert, especially in Jewish communities. Jersey City is part of the New York metropolitan area. ""This confirms a sad truth. There is a crisis of anti-Semitism gripping this nation. There is a crisis of anti-Semitism in this city,"" he said in a Wednesday news conference. He added: ""History tells us to take these warning signs seriously."" New York Police Department commissioner Dermot Shea added that hate crimes in New York City were up 22% this year. ""You see a swastika being drawn, you see a brick being thrown through a window, you see a woman walking down the street with her kids and having her wig ripped off,"" he said.

"Asian stock markets rose on Friday as the US and China moved toward striking a trade deal to avert a new round of tariffs. The deal could be announced later in the day, after US President Donald Trump reportedly signed off on the terms. Washington is said to have agreed to remove some tariffs, while Beijing would boost purchases of US farm goods. However, many of the more difficult issues are still to be addressed. Optimism surrounding a trade deal pushed Asian markets higher, with Japan's Nikkei 225 index rising 2.3% while Hong Kong's Hang Seng put on 2%. The Shanghai Composite added 1.2%. Earlier, US markets also gained ground with the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq closing at fresh record highs. ""It's a good starting point,"" Chamber of Commerce head of international affairs Myron Brilliant told broadcaster CNBC after meeting with White House officials. A deal would deliver a victory to Mr Trump, who is under political pressure, withdebate on his impeachment underway in the US Congress. He tweeted on Thursday that the US and China were ""very"" close to an agreement. ""They want it and so do we!"" he wrote. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Previous truces have collapsed and without a formal announcement or presentation of a written agreement, many remained wary. The US reportedly offered to halve tariff rates on about $350bn (Â£260bn) worth of Chinese goods, some of which had climbed as high as 25%. However, the deal is not expected to address many of the more difficult issues that triggered the fight, like China's subsidies for certain industries. ""This should NOT be described as a trade agreement,"" Jennifer Hillman, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and a former trade official, wrote on Twitter. ""It is a purchase and sale agreement that does virtually nothing to address substantive concerns of US (+rest of the world) with China's trade practices."" Allow Twitter content?

Mr Trump has repeatedly declared progress toward a deal that would end the trade war, which has seen tariffs imposed on more than $450bn worth of US-China trade and weighed on the global economy. In October, he announced that the two sides had agreed to terms for a ""Phase One"" deal, but negotiations dragged on. Without progress, the US had threatened to impose tariffs on more than $150bn worth of Chinese exports on 15 December. Trump tariff deadline looms: 'It's very scary' A quick guide to the US-China trade war Unlike earlier rounds of tariffs, this one was slated to fall largely on everyday items, including smartphones, children's books, footwear and clothing, heightening the economic stakes, since the US economy is driven by consumer spending. Optimism about a trade deal may be running high, but it's worth casting your mind back to why Mr Trump started this trade war with China in the first place. It was about levelling the playing field, he declared during his campaign, and to stop Beijing's unfair trade practices. The US said China unfairly subsidises its firms, and steals intellectual property from American companies which gives China an unfair advantage. It's unclear whether these issues will be in the final text of any agreement. Which means that Mr Trump's trade war has yet to achieve what it set out to. Meanwhile, economic growth forecasts around the world have been cut, companies have had to shift their supply chains out of China, and businesses have struggled to make hiring and expansion decisions in the face of trade war uncertainty. Washington's advantage over China has always been the threat of more tariffs. Suspending or rolling them back could be giving away the only leverage Mr Trump has, risking a deal with actual substance in favour of a quick and easy win.

"The pound and shares have surged after the Conservatives won a clear majority in the UK general election. Sterling rose above $1.35 at one point - its highest level since May last year - on hopes that the big majority would remove uncertainty over Brexit. The pound also jumped to a three-and-a-half-year high against the euro. On the stock market, the FTSE 100 share index rose 1.1%, while the FTSE 250 - which includes more UK-focused shares - briefly hit record highs. It closed 3.4% higher, while at the same time the pound traded at $1.33 and â¬1.20 Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the election result meant that the Conservative government ""has been given a powerful new mandate, to get Brexit done"". Mr Johnson has pledged to take the UK out of the European Union by 31 January. Businesses urge Johnson to secure trade deals Live: Market reaction to election result Why has the value of the pound jumped? Politically sensitive shares saw sharp rises on UK markets. Shares in water companies such as Severn Trent, which faced the possibility of nationalisation under a Labour government, rose 9%, while UK housebuilders also saw big gains, with Barratt up 14% and Persimmon 12% higher. Shares in banks exposed to the UK economy rose sharply. Barclays, RBS and Lloyds were up 6%, 8% and 5% respectively. Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com, said housebuilders had been undervalued and rose ""on hopes that construction will benefit from the Conservative victory"". ""We should also consider the potential risk that a Labour government could have posed to their profits being removed,"" Mr Wilson said. While many FTSE 100 shares saw big gains, this was offset slightly by the rise in the value of the pound, which affected companies with big international operations. A rise in sterling cuts the value of companies' overseas earnings when they are brought back to the UK and converted back into pounds. In contrast, the FTSE 250 index - which generally contains firms with more exposure to the domestic economy - jumped more than 5% at one point, before slipping back slightly. The financial bookies had already installed Boris Johnson as the favourite but did not expect him to romp home by such a distance. The pound moved sharply higher as soon as the exit poll was published and went on to post one of its biggest one-day gains against the dollar in years as Johnson's thumping victory removed one layer of political uncertainty. Shares in politically-sensitive sectors such as house building and banking rocketed, as did water, rail and energy companies, as the threat of nationalisation under a Corbyn government evaporated. Markets have given the prospect of a government with a functioning majority a round of applause but the euphoria may be short-lived. Traders are already talking about the formidable challenge of completing a trade deal with the EU by this time next year, along with the prospect of a new Scottish independence referendum. The election may be settled, but there are big political questions that are not. Guy Foster, head of research at wealth manager Brewin Dolphin, said that ""the potential for a smooth Brexit removes some of the downside risk for the UK economy"". ""This should be positive for both business and consumer confidence, at least in the short term, with a gradual acceleration in GDP growth and confidence. ""However, a lot can change over the coming months as the finer detail of the UK's future trade relationship with the EU is negotiated. ""This is still, after all, just the beginning of the exit process. Even with the passing of the withdrawal agreement, the UK could still leave the EU without a deal at the end of 2020 if trade negotiations don't proceed successfully."" Sterling hit a 19-month high of $1.3516 at one point overnight, but then gave up some of its gains. Andy Scott, associate director at financial risk adviser JCRA, said: ""What will be interesting to see - assuming that Brexit will now follow a set course, at least [until] 31 January - is if economic data is given a significant boost from the perceived certainty, and [whether it] starts to influence sterling again. ""In recent months, the market has almost completely ignored the slowdown in the economy and the potential for monetary stimulus from the Bank of England, with election and Brexit expectations driving fluctuations in sterling's value. ""The performance of the economy is likely to be key to whether we see a further recovery in 2020.""

"The wife of a jailed banker is fighting to overturn the UK's first Unexplained Wealth Order (UWO). Zamira Hajiyeva, who spent Â£16m in Harrods, faces losing her Â£15m Knightsbridge home and a Berkshire golf course to the National Crime Agency. Her husband is in prison in their native Azerbaijan for stealing millions from a state-owned bank he once headed. Mrs Hajiyeva denies all allegations of wrongdoing and the Court of Appeal was told she has been unfairly targeted. How to spend Â£16m in Harrods Jewellery linked to Zamira Hajiyeva seized James Lewis QC, who is representing Mrs Hajiyeva, said the NCA's entire case was based on unsupported claims that she had benefited from political corruption. ""UWOs are available against 'politically exposed persons' and their families even in the absence of any reasonable grounds to suspect criminal activity on their part,"" said Mr Lewis in legal submissions. ""They are therefore the most draconian and intrusive powers available to financial investigators in the UK today - and by some margin."" Mrs Hajiyeva's husband, Jahangir Hajiyev, was given a 15-year jail sentence for corruption following an unjust trial and was not able to defend the source of the family's wealth in court in London, said Mr Lewis. He added a judge's earlier conclusion that Mr Hajiyev was a potentially corrupt foreign official was flawed because he had merely headed a commercial bank with state shareholders, rather than a bank that was carrying out state functions. That meant, argued Mr Lewis, Mrs Hajiyeva should no longer have to prove to the NCA where her wealth came from. Mrs Hajiyeva's home in Knightsbridge, a short walk from Harrods During proceedings last year, the High Court was told that she spent an average of Â£4,000 a day in Harrods over 10 years to 2016 - spreading the cost of the jewellery and designer clothes over 54 credit cards, the majority issued by her husband's bank. In fresh papers disclosed at the Court of Appeal, the National Crime Agency revealed new details about its concerns over the family's activities in London. The documents state that following Mrs Hajiyeva's attempt last year to stop the UWO being imposed, her daughter, Leyla Mahmudova, took 49 items of jewellery worth Â£400,000 to the Christie's auction house. ""[Mrs Hajiyeva's] daughter attempted to sell high-value jewellery (some of which had been purchased by Mr Hajiyev), and that ZH is under investigation in Azerbaijan for fraudulently spending significant sums on air tickets, jewellery, tuition fees, beauty products, restaurants and hotels,"" said the NCA. Jonathan Hall QC, for the agency, said its order simply required Mrs Hajiyeva to respond to reasonable suspicions  - including why her home was owned by a company based in the British Virgin Islands. Claims that her husband had made his money selling fridge-freezers were wholly implausible, he added. A judgement in the case is expected next year. The result will indicate whether this tool has a powerful enough legal punch to help seize billions of pounds worth of British property belonging to suspected corrupt foreign officials and their families.

The exit poll is a way of forecasting what may happen in the general election, after voting ends but before the results are known. At this election researchers at 144 polling stations across England, Scotland and Wales asked people to indicate which way they voted. Scotland had only 12 sampling points so the exit poll was harder to forecast than in other parts of the country. A team of academics led by Sir John Curtice, professor of politics at Strathclyde University, used this and other data to estimate the vote share per party in each constituency and then to forecast each party's likelihood of winning in any given seat. All those individual probabilities were added together to arrive at the forecast seat totals for each party. The model was updated throughout the night as results came in, so seat totals and individual constituency figures changed. Theconstituency searchandseat-by-seatlist did show exit poll forecasts for individual constituencies, apart from those in Northern Ireland. But those initial forecasts have been replaced by the final figures. Explore results for all the constituencies across the UK.

Seats where the probability for any particular party winning was lower than 80% were shown as ""too close to forecast"". When looking at the figures for the exit poll, counting all the seats predicted for a particular party in the seat-by-seat view was unlikely to match the total for that party in the current forecast section. This was because the seat totals are calculated by adding up the probabilities for that party, not by counting the number of predicted constituency wins.

"SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon was in buoyant mood as she arrived at the Glasgow count The SNP has made big gains across Scotland, with Nicola Sturgeon saying the country had sent a ""clear message"" on a second independence referendum. The party won 48 seats after securing 45% of the vote -  8.1% more than in the last general election in 2017, when it won 35 seats. The SNP alsodefeated Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinsonin East Dunbartonshire. Ms Sturgeon said the result had exceeded her expectations. The Conservatives have won six seats, the Liberal Democrats four and Labour one. Neale Hanvey'svictory in Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeathis counted as an SNP gain from Labour because he was on the ballot paper as an SNP candidate. Mr Hanvey had been suspended by the party over allegations he made anti-Semitic posts on social media, and will sit as an independent MP. After 59 of 59 seats The Conservatives and Prime Minister Boris Johnson havewon an overall majority across the UKafter taking a string of former Labour strongholds in England and Wales. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said it was a ""very disappointing night for the Labour Party"" and confirmed he would not lead the party into the next election. The other main developments from Scotland's election night include: Liberal Democrat leaderJo Swinson narrowly lost her Dunbartonshire East seatto the SNP by just 149 votes Scottish Labour'sIan Murray held on to his seat in Edinburgh Southas his party lost all of its other MPs. TheSNP's Stephen Gethins lost to the Liberal Democratsin the UK's narrowest marginal seat, Fife North East.

But she said it was a ""clear endorsement Scotland should get to decide our future and not have it decided for us"".

""Boris Johnson has a mandate to take England out of the EU but he must accept that I have a mandate to give Scotland a choice for an alternative future."" Nicola Sturgeon says she won't pretend that every single person who voted SNP necessarily supports independence. But she will insist this result is a thumping endorsement of her demand for a second referendum. She will make an official request in the next few days to be granted the legal power to hold an independence vote. And we know that Boris Johnson will refuse, sparking a huge debate about whether the Conservatives are ignoring the democratic choice of Scottish voters. It's a debate that can only escalate as we leave the EU - and one which may fuel support for independence itself. Scotland on a constitutional collision course Scottish Secretary Alister Jack, who held Dumfries and Galloway for the Conservatives, said more people cast votes for unionist parties in Scotland than for the SNP. And he was adamant the prime minister should continue to block Ms Sturgeon's calls for power to hold an independence ballot. The Conservative vote had fallen by 3.5% to 25.1% across Scotland, while the Labour vote was down by 8.5% to 18.6%.

"The polls have closed and election night is upon us which, for some at least, means a night of strong cups of coffee, swingometers and a battle to stay awake. There are 650 seats in the House of Commons up for grabs, meaning the winning party needs 326 to claim a majority. Results are starting to come in, but how long will it be before we know who's really won? Here's a guide to what to look out for and when. Did the main parties manage to persuade the real life men of Workington to vote for them? What to look for:Is Labour's ""red wall"" crumbling? After that initial excitement, there might be a bit of a lull as results start to trickle in. Expect the early chat to be about Labour in the north-east of England, as places likeHalton,external,Washington & Sunderland West,externalandNewcastle upon Tyne East,externalwill declare early. Experts have talked about Labour's ""red wall"". These are traditionally Labour seats in north-east Wales, the Midlands and the north of England that voted in favour of Brexit. They're seen as key targets for the pro-Brexit Conservatives. One early seat to look out for isWorkington,external(remember all that talk ofWorkington man?), which is likely to declare shortly before 01:00. Labour has held the seat for 40 years, yet 61% of people there voted Leave. Has the ""get Brexit done"" Tory message cut through? Where are the seats that could turn the election? The big names facing a nervy night What to look for:Are the Tories winning in places like Wrexham? Things should begin to speed up a little bit. Look out for the result in Labour'sDarlington,external, which will declare at about 01:30. The Tories have targeted it. And if it's going to be a good night for Labour, they might hope to takeSwindon South,externaloff Justice Secretary Robert Buckland (he has a 2% majority). AndHartlepool,externalcould be interesting: Brexit Party chairman Richard Tice is standing there. The Tories will hope to winVale of Clwyd,externalandWrexham,external, which form the western end of that ""red wall"" we mentioned above. Meanwhile, in London, Justine Greening's former seat ofPutney,externalis up for grabs. Labour is eyeing it. And if it's a three-way, winner-takes-all, battle royal you're after, you're in luck. Just 360 votes separated the SNP (who came first), the Conservatives (second) and Labour (third) inLanark & Hamilton East,externallast time. There could be fireworks when it declares at about 01:30. LAURA KUENSSBERG:Historic change? SEAT-BY-SEAT:Exit poll forecast for your seat,external EXIT POLLS:How accurate are they? TEST YOURSELF:Richard Osman's election night quiz,external WHO WON, WHERE?Results in full,external Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn's seat should declare at about 03:00 What to look for:Was Iain Duncan Smith the first big casualty? Key Conservative targets including Labour'sStockton South,external(1% majority) andGreat Grimsby,externalare likely to declare before 03:00. And Caroline Flint's seat ofDon Valley,externalcould also be vulnerable to the Tories. Watch out for those. Labour is aiming for Alun Cairns's seat ofVale of Glamorgan,externaland will be looking for a big scalp in the shape of Iain Duncan Smith, inChingford and Woodford Green,external. The prominent Brexiteer and former Tory leader has a 2,438 (5.2%) majority. We should also get a sense of how the Lib Dems' night is going. They expect to winSt Albans,externalbut it is unclear how successful ex-Labour MP Chuka Umunna will be inCities of London and Westminster,external. Also watch out forSheffield Hallam,external, where Labour's Jared O'Mara is standing down - that's Nick Clegg's old seat. Leader Jo Swinson's seat ofDunbartonshire East,externalis also expected to declare about now. Her majority is just over 5,000. Labour shadow Scotland secretary Lesley Laird could lose herKirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath,externalseat andDartford,external, a bellwether seat that flip-flops between the Conservatives and Labour, should declare at about 03:00. That could be interesting. At about the same timeIslington North,external, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn's seat, should announce its result. Will Jeremy Corbyn's long march lead to power? Can Jo Swinson transform the Lib Dems' fortunes? What to look for:Beast of Bols-over - did Dennis Skinner lose? Watch for a Lib Dem win inDevon North,externalas it could spell trouble for the Conservatives in the South West. The Lib Dems are also eyeing a cabinet scalp in the shape of Dominic Raab. HisEsher and Walton,externalseat has returned Tory MPs for 100 years, but Remain-supporting voters could make it vulnerable for the party. It is worth watching if Labour firebrand Dennis Skinner losesBolsover,externalto the Conservatives after almost 50 years. John Mann's former Labour seat ofBassetlaw,externalcould turn blue. The same might happen inAshfield,external, whileCanterbury,externalmight also go back to the Conservatives - Rosie Duffield has a majority of just 187. Having defected from Labour and leaving herLiverpool Wavertree,externalconstituency, Luciana Berger is hoping to winFinchley and Golders Green,external. Another Lib Dem convert - Sam Gyimah - could be part of a three-way marginal inKensington,external(if he's lucky) And two results are due from Belfast just after 03:00. InBelfast South,external, Sinn Fein is standing aside in an attempt to help the SDLP oust the DUP. The SDLP is returning the favour inBelfast North,external. About an hour later we should also hear fromFermanagh & South Tyrone,externalwhere the UUP will hope the DUP's decision not to stand again helps them beat Sinn Fein. Profile: Boris Johnson's battles The battle to unseat Boris Johnson Boris Johnson should find out if he's been re-elected in Uxbridge and South Ruislip at about 05:00 What to look for:Dominic Grieve, Anna Soubry and of course Boris Johnson Hundreds of results will be in. But there's still more to come. Can ex-Tory Dominic Grieve winBeaconsfield,externalas an independent? And can fellow ex-Tory Anna Soubry winBroxtowe,external, or will she just open the door to a Labour gain? We should find out about now. Stoke-on-Trent North,externalandStoke-on-Trent Central,externalare both Brexit-supporting Labour seats under threat from the Conservatives. And Labour targetsMilton Keynes South,externalandHastings and Rye,externalare worth watching. Labour is also targetingLoughborough,external, the former seat of ex-minister Nicky Morgan, who has stood down. Finally, will Boris Johnson be slightly nervous inUxbridge and South Ruislip,external? He has the smallest majority of any sitting prime minister for 100 years. We'll find out if he wins at about 04:30. What difference could tactical voting make? A really simple guide to the election What to look for:Recounts, concessions and victory speeches Most counts will be completed by 06:00. But there could still be time to watch a big beast face defeat. One of Labour's best chances of a significant scalp is beating Environment Secretary Theresa Villiers inChipping Barnet,external. Independent Claire Wright has high hopes inDevon East,external, having come second last time and if the Lib Dems have made little progress so far, they should at least expect to winRichmond Park,external. Zac Goldsmith won the seat last time by just 45 votes. That should be about it. And if you've made it to 07:00, congratulations.

The exit poll is a way of forecasting what may happen in the general election, after voting ends but before the results are known. At this election researchers at 144 polling stations across England, Scotland and Wales asked people to indicate which way they voted. Scotland had only 12 sampling points so the exit poll was harder to forecast than in other parts of the country. A team of academics led by Sir John Curtice, professor of politics at Strathclyde University, used this and other data to estimate the vote share per party in each constituency and then to forecast each party's likelihood of winning in any given seat. All those individual probabilities were added together to arrive at the forecast seat totals for each party. The model was updated throughout the night as results came in, so seat totals and individual constituency figures changed. Theconstituency searchandseat-by-seatlist did show exit poll forecasts for individual constituencies, apart from those in Northern Ireland. But those initial forecasts have been replaced by the final figures. Explore results for all the constituencies across the UK.

Seats where the probability for any particular party winning was lower than 80% were shown as ""too close to forecast"". When looking at the figures for the exit poll, counting all the seats predicted for a particular party in the seat-by-seat view was unlikely to match the total for that party in the current forecast section. This was because the seat totals are calculated by adding up the probabilities for that party, not by counting the number of predicted constituency wins.

"The pound and shares have surged after the Conservatives won a clear majority in the UK general election. Sterling rose above $1.35 at one point - its highest level since May last year - on hopes that the big majority would remove uncertainty over Brexit. The pound also jumped to a three-and-a-half-year high against the euro. On the stock market, the FTSE 100 share index rose 1.1%, while the FTSE 250 - which includes more UK-focused shares - briefly hit record highs. It closed 3.4% higher, while at the same time the pound traded at $1.33 and â¬1.20 Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the election result meant that the Conservative government ""has been given a powerful new mandate, to get Brexit done"". Mr Johnson has pledged to take the UK out of the European Union by 31 January. Businesses urge Johnson to secure trade deals Live: Market reaction to election result Why has the value of the pound jumped? Politically sensitive shares saw sharp rises on UK markets. Shares in water companies such as Severn Trent, which faced the possibility of nationalisation under a Labour government, rose 9%, while UK housebuilders also saw big gains, with Barratt up 14% and Persimmon 12% higher. Shares in banks exposed to the UK economy rose sharply. Barclays, RBS and Lloyds were up 6%, 8% and 5% respectively. Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com, said housebuilders had been undervalued and rose ""on hopes that construction will benefit from the Conservative victory"". ""We should also consider the potential risk that a Labour government could have posed to their profits being removed,"" Mr Wilson said. While many FTSE 100 shares saw big gains, this was offset slightly by the rise in the value of the pound, which affected companies with big international operations. A rise in sterling cuts the value of companies' overseas earnings when they are brought back to the UK and converted back into pounds. In contrast, the FTSE 250 index - which generally contains firms with more exposure to the domestic economy - jumped more than 5% at one point, before slipping back slightly. The financial bookies had already installed Boris Johnson as the favourite but did not expect him to romp home by such a distance. The pound moved sharply higher as soon as the exit poll was published and went on to post one of its biggest one-day gains against the dollar in years as Johnson's thumping victory removed one layer of political uncertainty. Shares in politically-sensitive sectors such as house building and banking rocketed, as did water, rail and energy companies, as the threat of nationalisation under a Corbyn government evaporated. Markets have given the prospect of a government with a functioning majority a round of applause but the euphoria may be short-lived. Traders are already talking about the formidable challenge of completing a trade deal with the EU by this time next year, along with the prospect of a new Scottish independence referendum. The election may be settled, but there are big political questions that are not. Guy Foster, head of research at wealth manager Brewin Dolphin, said that ""the potential for a smooth Brexit removes some of the downside risk for the UK economy"". ""This should be positive for both business and consumer confidence, at least in the short term, with a gradual acceleration in GDP growth and confidence. ""However, a lot can change over the coming months as the finer detail of the UK's future trade relationship with the EU is negotiated. ""This is still, after all, just the beginning of the exit process. Even with the passing of the withdrawal agreement, the UK could still leave the EU without a deal at the end of 2020 if trade negotiations don't proceed successfully."" Sterling hit a 19-month high of $1.3516 at one point overnight, but then gave up some of its gains. Andy Scott, associate director at financial risk adviser JCRA, said: ""What will be interesting to see - assuming that Brexit will now follow a set course, at least [until] 31 January - is if economic data is given a significant boost from the perceived certainty, and [whether it] starts to influence sterling again. ""In recent months, the market has almost completely ignored the slowdown in the economy and the potential for monetary stimulus from the Bank of England, with election and Brexit expectations driving fluctuations in sterling's value. ""The performance of the economy is likely to be key to whether we see a further recovery in 2020.""

It's the first Christmas election in almost a century. And it's the dawn of a political world: gone are the days of hung parliaments, of knife-edge votes, and of unstable, wafer-thin majorities. Whatever your political stripes, there's undeniably a more stable situation here in Westminster. But Parliament still faces huge challenges in the weeks and months to come. So what happened? The exit poll dropped. It predicted a Conservative majority (correct) and suggested the Tories would get 368 MPs (only three out). As results poured in through the night, the electoral map began re-forming. It took until just before 15:00 for all the votes to be counted. The result? An 80-seat Conservative majority - the party's largest since 1987. Here's how things shaped up:  If you're looking for a quick catch-up:  Who said what today?  What's next for...  The best of the day's analysis:  And if youstillcan't get enough, don't worry, we'll be back tomorrow morning for more from the live page. Thanks for joining us. The Daily Telegraph celebrates the Conservative win and columnist Allison Pearson rebukes those who she says sought to dismiss Leave voters While the Guardian has chosen a far less festive picture of the prime minister for its front page Just over 24 hours ago, we had no idea what the political advent calendar would look like. But now the election is finally over, Boris Johnson has a huge majority of more than 80 seats to work with. So what could be in store for the first few weeks of his new premiership? TomorrowThe prime minister is expected to travel to meet his newly-elected Tory MPs. SundayExpect more drama, fall-out, and grilling during the first Sunday political shows since the election. Monday 16 DecemberMr Johnson is expected to announce a new-look team next week and his re-shuffle could start as soon as Monday - though we've heard there won't be any seismic movements. But those who had an impressive election campaign could be in line for promotion and others who struggled may be demoted as a result. Tuesday 17 DecemberMPs return to Westminster and begin the process of swearing in, where they take an oath of allegiance. Usually, the process lasts a few days, but it'll be rushed through in two days to make time for a Queen's Speech before Christmas. Thursday 19DecemberThe Queen will formally open Parliament, but with ""reduced ceremonial elements"".
The last State Opening was only a few weeks ago - on 14 October - just 10 days before Mr Johnson called the general election. Friday 20 DecemberThe Conservatives have promised to re-introduce Mr Johnson's Withdrawal Agreement Bill, which would ratify the deal with Brussels, in December in what they describe as an ""early Christmas present"" for voters.
Thiscouldmean MPs unusually sitting on a Friday in order for the bill to be introduced at first reading. Then we're all going to have a couple of weeks off for Christmas (at least we hope we are). January 2020If Parliament rises for its usual Christmas recess, MPs would be back in Westminster in early January to pass the Brexit bill.
They would only have a few weeks to get the legislation through both houses before the 31 January deadline. And beyond that?We're not being fooled into speculating that far ahead - a month is a long time in politics. But, Mr Johnson has repeatedly said he wants to ""get Brexit done"" so he can focus his party's other manifesto pledges. And with an 80-seat majority, he shouldn't struggle to pass legislation. The Times leads on the prime minister's ""healing"" message from Downing Street While the i focuses on the future of the United Kingdom after the SNP strengthened its hand in Scotland And the Financial Times looks ahead to the possible ramifications of the PM's election victory on Brexit negotiations with the EU An upbeat front cover from the Daily Mail praising Boris Johnson for lifting ""Britain's spirits"" But it's a more sombre offering from the Mirror, which looks at the fallout from Labour's defeat BBC News Channel Former Liberal Democrat MP Lembit Opik says the lack of leadership and policy flaws are to blame for the party's poor performance in the election. He describes Jo Swinson - who lost her seat and then resigned as leader earlier today - as a ""great MP"" but not a great leader: ""There's no substitute for experience. You've either got it, or you haven't - and she didn't."" Mr Opik, who lost his seat in 2010, says the Lib Dem's manifesto pledge of scrapping Brexit was ""crazy"" and ""not even slightly democratic"". ""That would be like me going back to Montgomeryshire, my old seat, and saying 'well actually I've changed my mind, I'm just going to carry on being the MP even though I marginally lost the seat'."" Lots of Remain supporters weren't happy with the policy, he says. ""It just wasn't credible."" What will the party need in the next leader? ""A very clear Liberal Democrat narrative,"" he says. ""I'm sad to say it, but it's been said privately anyway, number two: there has to be an ability to really reach out and communicate in a way that's got more gravitas than with Jo."" Mr Opik says he hopes the party will take a ""cold, hard look at what the Liberal Democrat core vote actually is, and rebuild from that."" Asked who he hopes will take up the mantle, he names Layla Moran, saying she has the ""charisma"" and the ""narrative"". BBC Radio 4 Labour MP Barry Gardiner is asked on BBC Radio 4's Any Questions what went wrong for the party and how does it recover from the outcome of the election. ""I think there were many factors in the result yesterday and we need the time to reflect what was wrong in the offer we put to the country and what it was people did not feel confident about in our manifesto,"" says Mr Gardiner. ""Was it that we offered too much? Certainly I believe it was offered in good faith. ""Yes, Brexit played a role in this and that is a difficult divide but I do think what we need to do is reflect on what we got wrong, move on fast and try and regain the trust of the people in this country and I think one of the ways we can do that is by holding this government to account, make sure there is proper scrutiny and make sure the government is transparent in all that it does."" Asked whether Jeremy Corbyn was to blame for the election outcome, Mr Gardiner adds: ""I think Jeremy Corbyn has been a decent, honourable man. ""He is a kind man, he is a very sincere man and I think people will look back to this election and will see some of things said about him over the last two years and come to see he has been vilified as well."" It's been a day of full-on drama - and there's been some good photo opportunities along the way. We've rounded up the day's best pictures here. We're here with a Question Time election special in Wandsworth, south-west London. The first question is from Daniel, who asks: ""Did Jeremy Corbyn lose the general election or did Boris Johnson win it?"" Transport Secretary Grant Shapps says ""the truth of the matter is people vote for a whole combination of reasons"" but ""people wanted to vote to unblock the country, to get things moving again. And I think that's the explanation for a surprisingly large majority in the end."" Asked about his surprise at the size of the Conservative majority, he says: ""In fact the PM called me at 10 to 10 - I'm famous for my spreadsheets and trying to make a prediction on this - and I thought that he'd have a majority but I have to say it took me by surprise in terms of the size,"" adding he thought it'd be about half of the 80-seat majority he ended up with. Over to Labour's Stephen Kinnock, who says: ""It is absolutely clear this is not a Tory victory, this is a Labour failure. How could the Labour Party not defeat a government like this? ""After nine years of Tory failure, they've turned our country into an international laughing stock... they're tearing our communities apart and yet they could not beat them. ""And that is a damning indictment of Labour's failure, I'm afraid to say."" Mr Kinnock says he received the same three messages on the doorstep. The first, he says, was an aversion to Jeremy Corbyn's leadership. On Brexit, he says voters did not understand why Labour was not prepared to ""respect the result of the referendum"", and when it came to the economy he says there was a feeling  there was a ""scatter-gun approach"" with ""too many promises"".  Stuart Garner says he's relieved about the election result Our business correspondent Rob Young has been visiting
businesses in Derbyshire to find out what they think the election result will
mean. Norton Motorcycles is near Donington Park - they export most of the bikes they
design and manufacture on site. Chief executive Stuart Garner says
he's relieved about the election result. ""If we want to go to India, China or
South America, huge motorbike markets, we face 60% tariffs. It makes us
uneconomic in these territories. The tantalising prospect for us is that
we manage to get some free trade agreements."" A few miles away in Derby are the offices of Work Wallet, a
health and safety app for employers. Boss Adam Civall would have preferred to
remain in the European Union but says he is happy with the result. ""There will
be some positives to pushing on with Brexit. As a business we have to adapt to
change and keep ahead. But any path towards hard or no-deal Brexit is
still the potential worst outcome."" Listen to Rob's full report on World Business Report on the BBC World Service. Nicholas WattPolitical editor, BBC Newsnight Loyalty and a ruthless ability to adapt were the twin weapons that once guaranteed the Tories a place as Britain's natural party of government. In recent years, however, rebellion against successive leaders from both sides on the Europe divide has been the party's default position. Internal squabbling came first, banishing memories of the collective Tory survival instinct that once served the party so well. The emphatic nature of Boris Johnson's win in the country means he is the unequivocal victor in the Conservatives' 30-year civil war over Europe. ""In the end the Leavers will win because they care more,"" one cabinet minister once told me. But how will loyalty and ruthless adaptation apply under Mr Johnson's premiership? Read the analysis in full here. BBC Radio 4 Plenty to talk about on Any Questions on BBC Radio 4 today with Conservative MP Therese Coffey, Labour MP Barry Gardiner and Liberal Democrats MP Layla Moran on the programme. First question from the audience: ""Do you think yesterday's result in the election has proved to be a good day for democracy."" Layla Moran starts by saying: ""I think it would be odd for me to say I am pleased with the result but we have a precious democracy and I have lived in paces that don't do what we do and every general election makes me proud to be in this country. ""But I am deeply, deeply concerned for the future of our country. The Liberal Democrats did stand on that stop Brexit platform because we felt it was the best future for our country."" Barry Gardiner adds: ""Every election is a good day for democracy because it forces politicians to remember that we are there to serve the public and not to dictate to them without their consent what we think ought to happen. ""Having said that, I also think yesterday has also brought dangers, dangers that the division in this country will not be healed and dangers that the poverty and inequality will increase."" Therese Coffey concludes: ""It was a good day for democracy. There were a lot of people that voted Conservative for the first time yesterday in seats that had been Labour for decades. They were fed up that leading parties who had said they would respect the referendum turned their back on those voters. ""We are very conscious that in our broad manifesto there are a lot of things we can do and will do to unite the country in a way that perhaps is unprecedented."" The US government has congratulated Boris Johnson on winning the election. In a statement, US official Morgan Ortagus said: ""The United States and United Kingdom share a unique partnership and essential alliance, based on a strong foundation of shared values and democratic principles. ""We look forward to continuing our critical work together with prime minister Johnson and his government to further strengthen our enduring special relationship, address mutual challenges, and build on the progress and prosperity we have made on so many fronts. ""The United States is committed to the US-UK shared global agenda, including expanding our robust economic relationship by reaching a comprehensive free trade agreement with the UK once it formally withdraws from the European Union."" It was a result not many people predicted: the Conservatives won their largest majority since 1987, and Labour lost seats in its northern heartlands - despite social media suggesting there would be a so-called youthquake at the polls. So, what exactly happened last night? Listen to Matthew Price dissect it all on Beyond Today on BBC Sounds. The newly victorious prime minister, Boris Johnson, has spoken with Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel and Irish Premier Leo Varadkar tonight. Both leaders congratulated him on his election victory. In a statement, the Irish government said: ""The Taoiseach and the prime minister spoke by phone this evening. ""They agreed there is now a significant opportunity to restore the Good Friday Agreement institutions, and pledged to work with the Northern Ireland parties to achieve this. ""They also discussed how to strengthen the bilateral relationship between Ireland and the UK.
Both looked forward to the smooth passage of the withdrawal agreement.
They agreed to stay in close contact in the period ahead."" Meanwhile, Mrs Merkel ""spoke about the importance of maintaining the strong relationship between Germany and the UK"" during her phone call with Mr Johnson, No 10 said. Radio 4 PM Former Conservative MP Dominic Grieve, who lost his seat in Buckinghamshire after running as an independent, says he has no regrets about the decisions he made that led to the end of his career in Parliament. Staunchly pro-remain, Mr Grieve was ejected from the Conservative Party earlier this year after he backed a bill to try to stop a no-deal Brexit. ""I don't regret what I did,"" he tells BBC Radio 4's PM programme. ""I could not stay in a Conservative Party led by Boris Johnson. Quite apart from Brexit I'm afraid my own assessment of his character is that he is someone I cannot trust. ""Interestingly, it was something that came up on the doorstep over and over again. The problem for many constituents was that they felt they were between the devil and the deep blue sea. The fear of Jeremy Corbyn was so strong and constituents said 'I would like to vote for you but I just can't, I must vote Conservative because there lies safety'. ""Whether it does or not, time will tell."" Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent Youâre also going to hear Boris Johnson talking a lot about one
nation conservatism in the next few months. But what is it? Well, in some ways thatâs down to whoever is defining it. There is no strict definition by which we can judge Boris Johnson over the next
few years. Itâs an idea which has been around in Tory circles for some time. But broadly, it refers to the idea the Conservative Party
should act for everybody in the UK. That means policies that work for people
from different economic backgrounds, from different regions and from the
different nations of the UK. There was a one nation group in the last parliament â which
was in part seen as a counterbalance to the pro-Brexit ERG who had been pulling
their weight when Theresa May was PM. This is how they defined what they were fighting for: Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

You may want to readTwitterâs cookie policy,externalandprivacy policy,externalbefore accepting. To view this content chooseâaccept and continueâ. Mr Johnsonâs focus on the one nation pitch suggests he will seek to offer policies to people beyond the Tory heartlands â more public spending for example after years of austerity. More focus on infrastructure outside London. A lot more talk about the north of England. That has become even more important now that a number of his MPs are from former Labour strongholds â sometimes with very different experiences of the British economy. It might not be easy though â especially when it comes to the idea the UK is indeed one nation. Last nightâs result puts Scottish independence firmly back on the agenda â and the electoral maps in England and Scotland look very different indeed. Protesters in central London on Friday evening Several hundred protesters have joined a rally in Glasgow city centre against Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Crowds have gathered on Buchanan Street to express their anger at the Conservative leader after his victory at the election. Campaigners are holding placards and chanting as anti-racist speakers address the crowds. Meanwhile, in central London, protesters are also on the march, including on Whitehall and near Leicester Square. The campaign group leading the push for a so-called people's vote has conceded a second referendum on EU membership is no longer on the cards. Open Britain, the organisation that succeeded the official Remain campaign of the 2016 referendum, says it will ""rebrand"" in the new year to push for a ""fair deal for Britain"" as the UK leaves the EU. Tom Baldwin, communications director of the People's Vote campaign, says he doesn't think there is ""much chance"" of the public having a vote on Boris Johnson's withdrawal agreement. In a statement, Open Britain says: ""The People's Vote will now refocus its campaign to concentrate on vital social issues that this government must urgently prioritise in its Brexit. It urges the government to ""avoid a hard Brexit"" which it says would be ""a disaster for our country"". ""The poorest and most vulnerable will be further marginalised if Boris Johnson's government crashes us out of the EU with no deal,"" it continues. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Mason Greenwood is the youngest player to score twice in the same game in Europe for Manchester United, aged 18 years and 72 days Mason Greenwood scored twice as Manchester United got four in 11 minutes to defeat AZ Alkmaar and secure a seeding for the Europa League knockout phase. After a mundane first half, the game burst into life in the 53rd minute when Ashley Young drove home Juan Mata's cross for his first goal since February. Greenwood stole the headlines though, firing home from the edge of the box before producing a fine left-footed finish to end the scoring frenzy. It was the first time the 18-year-old had scored two in a first-team game and took his overall tally for the season to six. He is now United's leading scorer in Europe this season and only Marcus Rashford has scored more in all competitions. In between the striker's double, Mata converted a penalty for the Spain midfielder's first goal of the season. The victory was United's biggest in Europe since 2016 when they beat another Dutch side, Feyenoord, by the same score and means they will avoid Benfica, Ajax and Inter Milan in Monday's last-32 draw. 'A killer in the box' - how good can Greenwood be? Thursday's Europa League reaction The victory was United's third in a row in all competitions, coming after impressive triumphs against Tottenham and Manchester City. It is only the third time United have done that since Ole Gunnar Solskjaer began his spell as United manager with eight successive wins after he replaced Jose Mourinho on 19 December last year. The opening period lacked a competitive edge but Solskjaer will be delighted at the way it turned out, particularly as, from the team that started against Manchester City, only Harry Maguire and Martial kept their places. This is crucial as, with a Carabao Cup quarter-final against Colchester in which they are overwhelming favourites, Solskjaer's side were starting what could turn out to be 19 games in 77 days, which will end with the second leg of their Europa League last-32 tie. The volume of fixtures is one of the reasons why it is still felt United need to make signings when the transfer window opens next month. When they entertain Everton on Sunday, United will reach an astonishing 4,000 consecutive games where a player they have been responsible for developing has been part of their matchday squad. It is a staggering statistic, one that dates back to October 1937 and a game against Fulham at Craven Cottage. Two of their modern-day products are Tahith Chong and Greenwood, who shared the memorable experience of being introduced as late substitutes in the memorable Champions League victory at Paris St-Germain in March. Greenwood has bounded along since then. Against Alkmaar he made his seventh start in 18 overall appearances that have now yielded six goals. He is an automatic member of Solskjaer's matchday squad and in October signed a new contract that will keep him at Old Trafford until 2023. By contrast, Chong has stalled. A Netherlands Under-21 player, he came on as a substitute here, his sixth appearance of the season - and only his second since 6 October. The midfielder's contract runs out at the end of the season and an extension offer remains unsigned amid rumours of excessive demands that United officials do not feel justify his performances. At 20, Chong is nearly two years older than Greenwood and the suspicion is growing that an impactful United career might prove beyond him. He tried hard enough on Thursday but the quality showed by Greenwood was missing. Greenwood was one of seven academy graduates to finish the game for Manchester United Manchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer told BT Sport: ""I told them to be more us [at half-time], be more Man United. I know it's difficult for players when you change but in the second half we just found a rhythm, made more passes forward, more runs forward, were pressing and got our goals."" On Mason Greenwood: ""He's different class as a finisher, if there's anything around the box you expect him to get a shot off and on target, he's good at creating space for himself and right foot, left foot it doesn't matter. I'm very pleased with his performance. ""He's a different type to Wazza [Wayne Rooney] and the good thing about Mason is he is just going to look forward to Sunday. It's natural for him to score goals, it doesn't matter what level it is."" Manchester United have won seven of their nine previous home games against Dutch sides in all competitions, keeping clean sheets in the last three. Juan Mata has been directly involved in three goals (one goal, two assists) in a single European match for the first time since March 2013, scoring once and assisting twice for Chelsea against Steaua Bucharest. Ashley Young has scored his first European goal for Manchester United since February 2012 when netting against Ajax. Only Marcus Rashford (13) has scored more goals than Mason Greenwood (six) in all competitions for Manchester United this season. Greenwood is the youngest player to score a double in major European competition for Manchester United, aged 18 years and 72 days. Manchester United return to action in the Premier League on Sunday (14:00 GMT) when they welcome Everton to Old Trafford.

"This video can not be played New CCTV of Jersey City shooters A gun attack on a Jewish supermarket in New Jersey is being investigated as domestic terrorism driven by anti-Semitism and hatred of police, officials say. The FBI is now overseeing the investigation into the attack in Jersey City, where four people were killed. Police shot two suspected attackers after a four-hour standoff. The suspects were identified as David Anderson, 47, and Francine Graham, 50. ""The evidence points towards acts of hate,"" state Attorney General Gurbir Grewal said. ""We are investigating this matter as potential acts of domestic terror, fuelled both by anti-Semitism and anti-law enforcement beliefs."" The threat of rising anti-Semitism He said the attackers had only fired on people in the supermarket and police officers. ""You can see clearly from the video that the individuals that engaged, the cowards that took down those innocent victims, engaged only with folks in that store and the law enforcement community,"" Mr Grewal said. ""You can see people that walked by, they didn't target them."" Mr Grewal said a pipe bomb had been recovered from the suspects' van, which had been equipped with bulletproof panels, along with five guns. Investigators had found a note at the scene, he added, but nothing that could be described as a manifesto had been found. Officials believe the suspects acted alone. US media have reported that one of the suspects had made anti-Semitic and anti-police social media posts online before the attack. At least one of the suspects appeared to be interested in a group called the Black Hebrew Israelites, whose believers say they are the true descendents of ancient Israelites, officials said. The group is listed by the Southern Poverty Law Center as a hate group. But Mr Grewal said no official link with the group had been established. Earlier Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop tweeted that ""hate and anti-Semitism"" had no place in the city. ""I think as more info comes out it will be more and more clear not only that this was a hate crime but that the perpetrators had hoped to kill many more people than four,"" he said. The violence began at a cemetery about one mile (1.6km) away from the grocery store. The pair killed Detective Joseph Seals, 39, who approached them for questioning about the murder of an Uber driver over the weekend, investigators said. Thy fled the scene in the van and drove to the kosher supermarket at 12:20 local time (17:20 GMT) where they held off armed police and federal officials for four hours, shooting off hundreds of rounds of ammunition. The attackers had opened fire on the shop before entering, alerting two officers on foot patrol who began firing at the suspects until they were injured by the attackers' gunfire. Mr Fulop told reporters that street cameras showed two people ""slowly"" drive towards the market, then ""calmly open the door with two long rifles and begin firing from the street"" into the shop. The incident ended just before 16:00 when officials used an armoured vehicle to ram through the front entrance of the shop and found the bodies of the attackers. The attack put approximately 30,000 students on lockdown, unable to leave their classrooms for hours after the school day had ended. The three victims inside the shop were killed soon after the gunfire broke out, but one managed to escape after being injured. They have been identified by New Jersey officials as Mindy Ferencz, 32; Miguel Douglas, 49; and Moshe Deutch, 24. ""Mindel Ferencz, may she rest in peace, was a pioneer,"" said Rabbi David Niederman, who first confirmed the death of the mother of five. ""She was a lady full of love for others,"" he added. ""Unfortunately, her life was cut so short."" Ferencz's mother told the New York Times that her husband, who owned the supermarket, had taken a break from work to go to a nearby synagogue minutes before shots rang out. Moshe Deutch, 24 Deutsch's death was also confirmed by Rabbi Niederman, who hailed him as a student who had worked to organise a food drive that provided help to 2,000 families each year. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio called the attack a ""hate crime"" and an ""act of terror"", and ordered police to be on high alert, especially in Jewish communities. Jersey City is part of the New York metropolitan area. ""This confirms a sad truth. There is a crisis of anti-Semitism gripping this nation. There is a crisis of anti-Semitism in this city,"" he said in a Wednesday news conference. He added: ""History tells us to take these warning signs seriously."" New York Police Department commissioner Dermot Shea added that hate crimes in New York City were up 22% this year. ""You see a swastika being drawn, you see a brick being thrown through a window, you see a woman walking down the street with her kids and having her wig ripped off,"" he said.

"This video can not be played New CCTV of Jersey City shooters A gun attack on a Jewish supermarket in New Jersey is being investigated as domestic terrorism driven by anti-Semitism and hatred of police, officials say. The FBI is now overseeing the investigation into the attack in Jersey City, where four people were killed. Police shot two suspected attackers after a four-hour standoff. The suspects were identified as David Anderson, 47, and Francine Graham, 50. ""The evidence points towards acts of hate,"" state Attorney General Gurbir Grewal said. ""We are investigating this matter as potential acts of domestic terror, fuelled both by anti-Semitism and anti-law enforcement beliefs."" The threat of rising anti-Semitism He said the attackers had only fired on people in the supermarket and police officers. ""You can see clearly from the video that the individuals that engaged, the cowards that took down those innocent victims, engaged only with folks in that store and the law enforcement community,"" Mr Grewal said. ""You can see people that walked by, they didn't target them."" Mr Grewal said a pipe bomb had been recovered from the suspects' van, which had been equipped with bulletproof panels, along with five guns. Investigators had found a note at the scene, he added, but nothing that could be described as a manifesto had been found. Officials believe the suspects acted alone. US media have reported that one of the suspects had made anti-Semitic and anti-police social media posts online before the attack. At least one of the suspects appeared to be interested in a group called the Black Hebrew Israelites, whose believers say they are the true descendents of ancient Israelites, officials said. The group is listed by the Southern Poverty Law Center as a hate group. But Mr Grewal said no official link with the group had been established. Earlier Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop tweeted that ""hate and anti-Semitism"" had no place in the city. ""I think as more info comes out it will be more and more clear not only that this was a hate crime but that the perpetrators had hoped to kill many more people than four,"" he said. The violence began at a cemetery about one mile (1.6km) away from the grocery store. The pair killed Detective Joseph Seals, 39, who approached them for questioning about the murder of an Uber driver over the weekend, investigators said. Thy fled the scene in the van and drove to the kosher supermarket at 12:20 local time (17:20 GMT) where they held off armed police and federal officials for four hours, shooting off hundreds of rounds of ammunition. The attackers had opened fire on the shop before entering, alerting two officers on foot patrol who began firing at the suspects until they were injured by the attackers' gunfire. Mr Fulop told reporters that street cameras showed two people ""slowly"" drive towards the market, then ""calmly open the door with two long rifles and begin firing from the street"" into the shop. The incident ended just before 16:00 when officials used an armoured vehicle to ram through the front entrance of the shop and found the bodies of the attackers. The attack put approximately 30,000 students on lockdown, unable to leave their classrooms for hours after the school day had ended. The three victims inside the shop were killed soon after the gunfire broke out, but one managed to escape after being injured. They have been identified by New Jersey officials as Mindy Ferencz, 32; Miguel Douglas, 49; and Moshe Deutch, 24. ""Mindel Ferencz, may she rest in peace, was a pioneer,"" said Rabbi David Niederman, who first confirmed the death of the mother of five. ""She was a lady full of love for others,"" he added. ""Unfortunately, her life was cut so short."" Ferencz's mother told the New York Times that her husband, who owned the supermarket, had taken a break from work to go to a nearby synagogue minutes before shots rang out. Moshe Deutch, 24 Deutsch's death was also confirmed by Rabbi Niederman, who hailed him as a student who had worked to organise a food drive that provided help to 2,000 families each year. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio called the attack a ""hate crime"" and an ""act of terror"", and ordered police to be on high alert, especially in Jewish communities. Jersey City is part of the New York metropolitan area. ""This confirms a sad truth. There is a crisis of anti-Semitism gripping this nation. There is a crisis of anti-Semitism in this city,"" he said in a Wednesday news conference. He added: ""History tells us to take these warning signs seriously."" New York Police Department commissioner Dermot Shea added that hate crimes in New York City were up 22% this year. ""You see a swastika being drawn, you see a brick being thrown through a window, you see a woman walking down the street with her kids and having her wig ripped off,"" he said.

"This video can not be played Democrat Jerry Nadler announces the articles of impeachment Ever since Nancy Pelosi announced last week that she was instructing the Judiciary Committee to draft articles of impeachment against Donald Trump, speculation swirled as to what exactly they would look like. Would they be broad, sweeping in a hodgepodge of alleged presidential misdeeds that include evidence gathered over the course of Mr Trump's three-year presidency? Or would they go narrow, and focus primarily on this latest Ukraine controversy. Now we have our answer. Narrow it is. Democrats probably decided to, as the saying goes, ""keep it simple, stupid"". Democrats unveil formal charges Viewpoint: Evidence for impeachment thin They have what they hope will be an easy to understand case of presidential abuse of power, by using the vast tools of foreign policy at his disposal for personal political gain. As a backstop to these charges, they are accusing the president of attempting to obstruct Congress's investigation by denying relevant documents and witness testimony. At stake, they will argue, is the security of the 2020 presidential election and the protection of congressional authority as a co-equal branch of government. The main script from here appears clear - a quick vote in the Judiciary Committee, followed by one on the floor of the House of Representatives; presidential impeachment and a Senate trial. In the meantime, much to the consternation of some liberals, congressional Democrats will move to hand the president a policy victory - by approving his renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement. And during all of this, a fever of allegations and accusations continue to swirl and threaten to erupt and disrupt the process in one way or another. There's claims of intelligence agency misconduct in its investigation of 2016 Trump-Russia ties, presidential Twitter barbs at his own FBI director, criminal investigations of the president's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, and much more. While the main script may be clear, beneath the surface unpredictability is the only predictable result.

"The Conservatives have 365 MPs, Labour 203, the SNP 48, Liberal Democrats 11 and the DUP eight Sinn Fein have seven MPs, Plaid Cymru four, the SDLP have two; and the Green Party and Alliance Party one each Boris Johnson's party has the largest Tory majority since 1987 He says he will repay the trust of voters and lead a ""people's government"" He has been to see the Queen and speaking outside No 10 urged the UK to ""unite"" and ""everyone to find closure and to let the healing begin"" Jeremy Corbyn says he did ""everything he could"" to win and will stand down as leader early next year Jo Swinson loses her seat, stands down as Liberal Democrat leader, and urges her party to ""regroup"" Nicola Sturgeon says the PM has ""no right"" to block another Scottish independence referendum There will be a minor reshuffle on Monday and the Brexit bill will go before MPs next Friday Chris Lansdown and Dulcie Lee A momentous 24 hours in politics draws to a close. It's the first Christmas election in almost a century. And it's the dawn of a political world: gone are the days of hung parliaments, of knife-edge votes, and of unstable, wafer-thin majorities. Whatever your political stripes, there's undeniably a more stable situation here in Westminster. But Parliament still faces huge challenges in the weeks and months to come. So what happened? The exit poll dropped. It predicted a Conservative majority (correct) and suggested the Tories would get 368 MPs (only three out). As results poured in through the night, the electoral map began re-forming. It took until just before 15:00 for all the votes to be counted. The result? An 80-seat Conservative majority - the party's largest since 1987. Here's how things shaped up:  If you're looking for a quick catch-up:  Who said what today?  What's next for...  The best of the day's analysis:  And if youstillcan't get enough, don't worry, we'll be back tomorrow morning for more from the live page. Thanks for joining us. The Daily Telegraph celebrates the Conservative win and columnist Allison Pearson rebukes those who she says sought to dismiss Leave voters While the Guardian has chosen a far less festive picture of the prime minister for its front page Just over 24 hours ago, we had no idea what the political advent calendar would look like. But now the election is finally over, Boris Johnson has a huge majority of more than 80 seats to work with. So what could be in store for the first few weeks of his new premiership? TomorrowThe prime minister is expected to travel to meet his newly-elected Tory MPs. SundayExpect more drama, fall-out, and grilling during the first Sunday political shows since the election. Monday 16 DecemberMr Johnson is expected to announce a new-look team next week and his re-shuffle could start as soon as Monday - though we've heard there won't be any seismic movements. But those who had an impressive election campaign could be in line for promotion and others who struggled may be demoted as a result. Tuesday 17 DecemberMPs return to Westminster and begin the process of swearing in, where they take an oath of allegiance. Usually, the process lasts a few days, but it'll be rushed through in two days to make time for a Queen's Speech before Christmas. Thursday 19DecemberThe Queen will formally open Parliament, but with ""reduced ceremonial elements"".
The last State Opening was only a few weeks ago - on 14 October - just 10 days before Mr Johnson called the general election. Friday 20 DecemberThe Conservatives have promised to re-introduce Mr Johnson's Withdrawal Agreement Bill, which would ratify the deal with Brussels, in December in what they describe as an ""early Christmas present"" for voters.
Thiscouldmean MPs unusually sitting on a Friday in order for the bill to be introduced at first reading. Then we're all going to have a couple of weeks off for Christmas (at least we hope we are). January 2020If Parliament rises for its usual Christmas recess, MPs would be back in Westminster in early January to pass the Brexit bill.
They would only have a few weeks to get the legislation through both houses before the 31 January deadline. And beyond that?We're not being fooled into speculating that far ahead - a month is a long time in politics. But, Mr Johnson has repeatedly said he wants to ""get Brexit done"" so he can focus his party's other manifesto pledges. And with an 80-seat majority, he shouldn't struggle to pass legislation. The Times leads on the prime minister's ""healing"" message from Downing Street While the i focuses on the future of the United Kingdom after the SNP strengthened its hand in Scotland And the Financial Times looks ahead to the possible ramifications of the PM's election victory on Brexit negotiations with the EU An upbeat front cover from the Daily Mail praising Boris Johnson for lifting ""Britain's spirits"" But it's a more sombre offering from the Mirror, which looks at the fallout from Labour's defeat BBC News Channel Former Liberal Democrat MP Lembit Opik says the lack of leadership and policy flaws are to blame for the party's poor performance in the election. He describes Jo Swinson - who lost her seat and then resigned as leader earlier today - as a ""great MP"" but not a great leader: ""There's no substitute for experience. You've either got it, or you haven't - and she didn't."" Mr Opik, who lost his seat in 2010, says the Lib Dem's manifesto pledge of scrapping Brexit was ""crazy"" and ""not even slightly democratic"". ""That would be like me going back to Montgomeryshire, my old seat, and saying 'well actually I've changed my mind, I'm just going to carry on being the MP even though I marginally lost the seat'."" Lots of Remain supporters weren't happy with the policy, he says. ""It just wasn't credible."" What will the party need in the next leader? ""A very clear Liberal Democrat narrative,"" he says. ""I'm sad to say it, but it's been said privately anyway, number two: there has to be an ability to really reach out and communicate in a way that's got more gravitas than with Jo."" Mr Opik says he hopes the party will take a ""cold, hard look at what the Liberal Democrat core vote actually is, and rebuild from that."" Asked who he hopes will take up the mantle, he names Layla Moran, saying she has the ""charisma"" and the ""narrative"". BBC Radio 4 Labour MP Barry Gardiner is asked on BBC Radio 4's Any Questions what went wrong for the party and how does it recover from the outcome of the election. ""I think there were many factors in the result yesterday and we need the time to reflect what was wrong in the offer we put to the country and what it was people did not feel confident about in our manifesto,"" says Mr Gardiner. ""Was it that we offered too much? Certainly I believe it was offered in good faith. ""Yes, Brexit played a role in this and that is a difficult divide but I do think what we need to do is reflect on what we got wrong, move on fast and try and regain the trust of the people in this country and I think one of the ways we can do that is by holding this government to account, make sure there is proper scrutiny and make sure the government is transparent in all that it does."" Asked whether Jeremy Corbyn was to blame for the election outcome, Mr Gardiner adds: ""I think Jeremy Corbyn has been a decent, honourable man. ""He is a kind man, he is a very sincere man and I think people will look back to this election and will see some of things said about him over the last two years and come to see he has been vilified as well."" It's been a day of full-on drama - and there's been some good photo opportunities along the way. We've rounded up the day's best pictures here. We're here with a Question Time election special in Wandsworth, south-west London. The first question is from Daniel, who asks: ""Did Jeremy Corbyn lose the general election or did Boris Johnson win it?"" Transport Secretary Grant Shapps says ""the truth of the matter is people vote for a whole combination of reasons"" but ""people wanted to vote to unblock the country, to get things moving again. And I think that's the explanation for a surprisingly large majority in the end."" Asked about his surprise at the size of the Conservative majority, he says: ""In fact the PM called me at 10 to 10 - I'm famous for my spreadsheets and trying to make a prediction on this - and I thought that he'd have a majority but I have to say it took me by surprise in terms of the size,"" adding he thought it'd be about half of the 80-seat majority he ended up with. Over to Labour's Stephen Kinnock, who says: ""It is absolutely clear this is not a Tory victory, this is a Labour failure. How could the Labour Party not defeat a government like this? ""After nine years of Tory failure, they've turned our country into an international laughing stock... they're tearing our communities apart and yet they could not beat them. ""And that is a damning indictment of Labour's failure, I'm afraid to say."" Mr Kinnock says he received the same three messages on the doorstep. The first, he says, was an aversion to Jeremy Corbyn's leadership. On Brexit, he says voters did not understand why Labour was not prepared to ""respect the result of the referendum"", and when it came to the economy he says there was a feeling  there was a ""scatter-gun approach"" with ""too many promises"".  Stuart Garner says he's relieved about the election result Our business correspondent Rob Young has been visiting
businesses in Derbyshire to find out what they think the election result will
mean. Norton Motorcycles is near Donington Park - they export most of the bikes they
design and manufacture on site. Chief executive Stuart Garner says
he's relieved about the election result. ""If we want to go to India, China or
South America, huge motorbike markets, we face 60% tariffs. It makes us
uneconomic in these territories. The tantalising prospect for us is that
we manage to get some free trade agreements."" A few miles away in Derby are the offices of Work Wallet, a
health and safety app for employers. Boss Adam Civall would have preferred to
remain in the European Union but says he is happy with the result. ""There will
be some positives to pushing on with Brexit. As a business we have to adapt to
change and keep ahead. But any path towards hard or no-deal Brexit is
still the potential worst outcome."" Listen to Rob's full report on World Business Report on the BBC World Service. Nicholas WattPolitical editor, BBC Newsnight Loyalty and a ruthless ability to adapt were the twin weapons that once guaranteed the Tories a place as Britain's natural party of government. In recent years, however, rebellion against successive leaders from both sides on the Europe divide has been the party's default position. Internal squabbling came first, banishing memories of the collective Tory survival instinct that once served the party so well. The emphatic nature of Boris Johnson's win in the country means he is the unequivocal victor in the Conservatives' 30-year civil war over Europe. ""In the end the Leavers will win because they care more,"" one cabinet minister once told me. But how will loyalty and ruthless adaptation apply under Mr Johnson's premiership? Read the analysis in full here. BBC Radio 4 Plenty to talk about on Any Questions on BBC Radio 4 today with Conservative MP Therese Coffey, Labour MP Barry Gardiner and Liberal Democrats MP Layla Moran on the programme. First question from the audience: ""Do you think yesterday's result in the election has proved to be a good day for democracy."" Layla Moran starts by saying: ""I think it would be odd for me to say I am pleased with the result but we have a precious democracy and I have lived in paces that don't do what we do and every general election makes me proud to be in this country. ""But I am deeply, deeply concerned for the future of our country. The Liberal Democrats did stand on that stop Brexit platform because we felt it was the best future for our country."" Barry Gardiner adds: ""Every election is a good day for democracy because it forces politicians to remember that we are there to serve the public and not to dictate to them without their consent what we think ought to happen. ""Having said that, I also think yesterday has also brought dangers, dangers that the division in this country will not be healed and dangers that the poverty and inequality will increase."" Therese Coffey concludes: ""It was a good day for democracy. There were a lot of people that voted Conservative for the first time yesterday in seats that had been Labour for decades. They were fed up that leading parties who had said they would respect the referendum turned their back on those voters. ""We are very conscious that in our broad manifesto there are a lot of things we can do and will do to unite the country in a way that perhaps is unprecedented."" The US government has congratulated Boris Johnson on winning the election. In a statement, US official Morgan Ortagus said: ""The United States and United Kingdom share a unique partnership and essential alliance, based on a strong foundation of shared values and democratic principles. ""We look forward to continuing our critical work together with prime minister Johnson and his government to further strengthen our enduring special relationship, address mutual challenges, and build on the progress and prosperity we have made on so many fronts. ""The United States is committed to the US-UK shared global agenda, including expanding our robust economic relationship by reaching a comprehensive free trade agreement with the UK once it formally withdraws from the European Union."" It was a result not many people predicted: the Conservatives won their largest majority since 1987, and Labour lost seats in its northern heartlands - despite social media suggesting there would be a so-called youthquake at the polls. So, what exactly happened last night? Listen to Matthew Price dissect it all on Beyond Today on BBC Sounds. The newly victorious prime minister, Boris Johnson, has spoken with Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel and Irish Premier Leo Varadkar tonight. Both leaders congratulated him on his election victory. In a statement, the Irish government said: ""The Taoiseach and the prime minister spoke by phone this evening. ""They agreed there is now a significant opportunity to restore the Good Friday Agreement institutions, and pledged to work with the Northern Ireland parties to achieve this. ""They also discussed how to strengthen the bilateral relationship between Ireland and the UK.
Both looked forward to the smooth passage of the withdrawal agreement.
They agreed to stay in close contact in the period ahead."" Meanwhile, Mrs Merkel ""spoke about the importance of maintaining the strong relationship between Germany and the UK"" during her phone call with Mr Johnson, No 10 said. Radio 4 PM Former Conservative MP Dominic Grieve, who lost his seat in Buckinghamshire after running as an independent, says he has no regrets about the decisions he made that led to the end of his career in Parliament. Staunchly pro-remain, Mr Grieve was ejected from the Conservative Party earlier this year after he backed a bill to try to stop a no-deal Brexit. ""I don't regret what I did,"" he tells BBC Radio 4's PM programme. ""I could not stay in a Conservative Party led by Boris Johnson. Quite apart from Brexit I'm afraid my own assessment of his character is that he is someone I cannot trust. ""Interestingly, it was something that came up on the doorstep over and over again. The problem for many constituents was that they felt they were between the devil and the deep blue sea. The fear of Jeremy Corbyn was so strong and constituents said 'I would like to vote for you but I just can't, I must vote Conservative because there lies safety'. ""Whether it does or not, time will tell."" Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent Youâre also going to hear Boris Johnson talking a lot about one
nation conservatism in the next few months. But what is it? Well, in some ways thatâs down to whoever is defining it. There is no strict definition by which we can judge Boris Johnson over the next
few years. Itâs an idea which has been around in Tory circles for some time. But broadly, it refers to the idea the Conservative Party
should act for everybody in the UK. That means policies that work for people
from different economic backgrounds, from different regions and from the
different nations of the UK. There was a one nation group in the last parliament â which
was in part seen as a counterbalance to the pro-Brexit ERG who had been pulling
their weight when Theresa May was PM. This is how they defined what they were fighting for: Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mr Johnsonâs focus on the one nation pitch suggests he will seek to offer policies to people beyond the Tory heartlands â more public spending for example after years of austerity. More focus on infrastructure outside London. A lot more talk about the north of England. That has become even more important now that a number of his MPs are from former Labour strongholds â sometimes with very different experiences of the British economy. It might not be easy though â especially when it comes to the idea the UK is indeed one nation. Last nightâs result puts Scottish independence firmly back on the agenda â and the electoral maps in England and Scotland look very different indeed. Protesters in central London on Friday evening Several hundred protesters have joined a rally in Glasgow city centre against Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Crowds have gathered on Buchanan Street to express their anger at the Conservative leader after his victory at the election. Campaigners are holding placards and chanting as anti-racist speakers address the crowds. Meanwhile, in central London, protesters are also on the march, including on Whitehall and near Leicester Square. The campaign group leading the push for a so-called people's vote has conceded a second referendum on EU membership is no longer on the cards. Open Britain, the organisation that succeeded the official Remain campaign of the 2016 referendum, says it will ""rebrand"" in the new year to push for a ""fair deal for Britain"" as the UK leaves the EU. Tom Baldwin, communications director of the People's Vote campaign, says he doesn't think there is ""much chance"" of the public having a vote on Boris Johnson's withdrawal agreement. In a statement, Open Britain says: ""The People's Vote will now refocus its campaign to concentrate on vital social issues that this government must urgently prioritise in its Brexit. It urges the government to ""avoid a hard Brexit"" which it says would be ""a disaster for our country"". ""The poorest and most vulnerable will be further marginalised if Boris Johnson's government crashes us out of the EU with no deal,"" it continues. Â© 2025 BBC.

"The wife of a jailed banker is fighting to overturn the UK's first Unexplained Wealth Order (UWO). Zamira Hajiyeva, who spent Â£16m in Harrods, faces losing her Â£15m Knightsbridge home and a Berkshire golf course to the National Crime Agency. Her husband is in prison in their native Azerbaijan for stealing millions from a state-owned bank he once headed. Mrs Hajiyeva denies all allegations of wrongdoing and the Court of Appeal was told she has been unfairly targeted. How to spend Â£16m in Harrods Jewellery linked to Zamira Hajiyeva seized James Lewis QC, who is representing Mrs Hajiyeva, said the NCA's entire case was based on unsupported claims that she had benefited from political corruption. ""UWOs are available against 'politically exposed persons' and their families even in the absence of any reasonable grounds to suspect criminal activity on their part,"" said Mr Lewis in legal submissions. ""They are therefore the most draconian and intrusive powers available to financial investigators in the UK today - and by some margin."" Mrs Hajiyeva's husband, Jahangir Hajiyev, was given a 15-year jail sentence for corruption following an unjust trial and was not able to defend the source of the family's wealth in court in London, said Mr Lewis. He added a judge's earlier conclusion that Mr Hajiyev was a potentially corrupt foreign official was flawed because he had merely headed a commercial bank with state shareholders, rather than a bank that was carrying out state functions. That meant, argued Mr Lewis, Mrs Hajiyeva should no longer have to prove to the NCA where her wealth came from. Mrs Hajiyeva's home in Knightsbridge, a short walk from Harrods During proceedings last year, the High Court was told that she spent an average of Â£4,000 a day in Harrods over 10 years to 2016 - spreading the cost of the jewellery and designer clothes over 54 credit cards, the majority issued by her husband's bank. In fresh papers disclosed at the Court of Appeal, the National Crime Agency revealed new details about its concerns over the family's activities in London. The documents state that following Mrs Hajiyeva's attempt last year to stop the UWO being imposed, her daughter, Leyla Mahmudova, took 49 items of jewellery worth Â£400,000 to the Christie's auction house. ""[Mrs Hajiyeva's] daughter attempted to sell high-value jewellery (some of which had been purchased by Mr Hajiyev), and that ZH is under investigation in Azerbaijan for fraudulently spending significant sums on air tickets, jewellery, tuition fees, beauty products, restaurants and hotels,"" said the NCA. Jonathan Hall QC, for the agency, said its order simply required Mrs Hajiyeva to respond to reasonable suspicions  - including why her home was owned by a company based in the British Virgin Islands. Claims that her husband had made his money selling fridge-freezers were wholly implausible, he added. A judgement in the case is expected next year. The result will indicate whether this tool has a powerful enough legal punch to help seize billions of pounds worth of British property belonging to suspected corrupt foreign officials and their families.

How to spend Â£16m in Harrods Jewellery linked to Zamira Hajiyeva seized James Lewis QC, who is representing Mrs Hajiyeva, said the NCA's entire case was based on unsupported claims that she had benefited from political corruption. ""UWOs are available against 'politically exposed persons' and their families even in the absence of any reasonable grounds to suspect criminal activity on their part,"" said Mr Lewis in legal submissions. ""They are therefore the most draconian and intrusive powers available to financial investigators in the UK today - and by some margin."" Mrs Hajiyeva's husband, Jahangir Hajiyev, was given a 15-year jail sentence for corruption following an unjust trial and was not able to defend the source of the family's wealth in court in London, said Mr Lewis. He added a judge's earlier conclusion that Mr Hajiyev was a potentially corrupt foreign official was flawed because he had merely headed a commercial bank with state shareholders, rather than a bank that was carrying out state functions. That meant, argued Mr Lewis, Mrs Hajiyeva should no longer have to prove to the NCA where her wealth came from. Mrs Hajiyeva's home in Knightsbridge, a short walk from Harrods During proceedings last year, the High Court was told that she spent an average of Â£4,000 a day in Harrods over 10 years to 2016 - spreading the cost of the jewellery and designer clothes over 54 credit cards, the majority issued by her husband's bank. In fresh papers disclosed at the Court of Appeal, the National Crime Agency revealed new details about its concerns over the family's activities in London. The documents state that following Mrs Hajiyeva's attempt last year to stop the UWO being imposed, her daughter, Leyla Mahmudova, took 49 items of jewellery worth Â£400,000 to the Christie's auction house. ""[Mrs Hajiyeva's] daughter attempted to sell high-value jewellery (some of which had been purchased by Mr Hajiyev), and that ZH is under investigation in Azerbaijan for fraudulently spending significant sums on air tickets, jewellery, tuition fees, beauty products, restaurants and hotels,"" said the NCA. Jonathan Hall QC, for the agency, said its order simply required Mrs Hajiyeva to respond to reasonable suspicions  - including why her home was owned by a company based in the British Virgin Islands. Claims that her husband had made his money selling fridge-freezers were wholly implausible, he added. A judgement in the case is expected next year. The result will indicate whether this tool has a powerful enough legal punch to help seize billions of pounds worth of British property belonging to suspected corrupt foreign officials and their families.

"Nicky Campbell, pictured with his mother Sheila: ""She was my adoptive mum. She was my real mum"" BBC Radio 5 Live's Nicky Campbell has written a heartfelt tribute to his ""wonderful"" mother Sheila, who has died at the age of 96. Along with her husband, Frank Campbell, she adopted Nicky as a four-day-old baby in 1961. Sheila Campbell, a World War Two radar operator who became a social worker, was part of Nicky's 2007 episode of BBC One's Who Do You Think You Are? She also spoke about being a radar operator on BBC Radio 5 Live in June. ""The day she and Dad adopted me was the day I won the lottery,"" he tweeted. Campbell, who missed presenting Thursday's edition of 5 Live Breakfast, added that Sheila ""doted on her grandchildren and my girls completely adored her. Everyone did"". Allow Twitter content?

Burden then added: ""I knew her in the course of my friendship with Nicky developing over the years. She was an incredible woman and I feel really, really privileged to have known her. ""Nicky will be back at work tomorrow because, as he says, his mum would have said, 'Of course you should be working, it's the general election results day.' ""So he will be here tomorrow.

He discovered more about his father's time serving with the Indian army during World War Two - fighting Japanese troops in what has come to be known as ""the forgotten war"" - and had some shocking revelations about his grandfather's childhood. Summing up the experience, he said: ""I'm so proud of this extraordinary family I was adopted into. All the stories I've heard somehow all contributed to making my dad the most wonderful dad that I could have had. ""It couldn't have been for me more fascinating, revealing and enlightening.

"""This year I have taken two hangover days when I've been out with my friends, and I've taken three from when I've been out on work nights."" Ellie is 19 and works as a PR manager for a digital marketing agency. Like a growing number of employers, her boss offers flexible working arrangements, including flexible hours and unlimited holiday. It also lets employees take ""hangover days"" where they work from the comfort of their own sofa - or even bed. ""The perk has a lot in it,"" Ellie told BBC 5 Live's Wake Up To Money. ""It is about honesty, it's about people being able to not lie to their managers. ""But also, the idea behind it is that parents have a lot of perks at our business but there are not necessarily any for people who don't have children. ""So this is a perk for people who don't have kids."" Ellie's boss is Claire Crompton, co-founder and director of The Audit Lab. The company is based in Bolton and she says that offering attractive perks is key to attracting talent out of Manchester. ""We wanted to offer something to younger millennials who typically go out mid-week and do the pub quiz. My team book a hangover day in advance, if they know they are going out. ""They just work in their PJs, sat at home on the couch,"" she said. Claire Crompton (purple dress) and some of her team at Audit Lab Claire added: ""If people used it two or three times a week and missed important client meetings then we'd have to have a think. But everyone has been really respectful of it so far. ""It's basically a work-from-home day, but we've sexed it up a bit to appeal to the younger generation,"" she said. ""It promotes honesty as well."" For Claire, one of the motivations is the expectation that staff will sometimes go out in the evening for work events and client entertainment. About 84% of official workplace social events involve alcohol, according to research carried out for the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, and shown exclusively to Wake Up To Money. With the Christmas party season in full flow, 40% of businesses that are planning a Christmas event say that alcohol will be freely available and paid for by the company, while 39% say alcohol will be available to buy with no limit. The impact can be positive and negative. Four out of 10 HR managers surveyed said that alcohol can cause problems at work. But almost 50% of the managers said having some drinks at social events had a positive effect on morale and team bonding. Dr Jill Miller, diversity and inclusion adviser at the CIPD, thinks the branding could cause concerns. ""Focusing on flexible working is really positive, especially showing it's not just for working parents,"" she says. ""Looking at why each age group wants flexibility is important. ""But labelling them as 'hangover days' might not be as helpful if it's encouraging excessive alcohol consumption. Employers have a duty of care and need to consider that when designing policies. Is it promoting drinking? I'd suggest a rethink on the labelling."" Ellie says it's not a benefit anyone would think to abuse. She said: ""Everyone is pretty much the same, they take them as and when they need them, no one really takes the mick or takes too many. Everyone just used them when they're needed. ""Most recently, I was on a date night with my partner. We'd just gone out to a restaurant and we'd had a bottle of wine, and then a few of my friends were out and I thought 'well, we'll go to the pub with them'. ""Before you know it, we'd had a few and we got back a bit late. So the next morning I rang Claire and I just said: 'I am feeling a bit worse for wear.' Claire Crompton co-founder and director of The Audit Lab ""I would have been more embarrassed trying to pretend that I was ill. If I'd had to ring her and pretend to be ill I would have felt really bad every time I saw her and would have had to keep up a lie. ""Because I knew I was just being honest with her I wasn't embarrassed at all,"" she said. Flexitime is a well-recognised benefit, and unlimited holiday is slowly gathering traction. But most of us will have to make it through December without hangover days as a workplace perk.

"This video can not be played Weinstein attended a court hearing on Wednesday using a walking frame Film mogul Harvey Weinstein has reached a tentative $25m (Â£19m) settlement with dozens of women who have accused him of sexual misconduct, lawyers have said. About 30 actresses and ex-employees would share the payout in the deal. However, it still needs signing off by all parties, Mr Weinstein's lawyers have not commented and some say the deal will punish those holding out. Mr Weinstein faces a separate criminal trial next month on rape and sexual assault charges, which he denies. The Hollywood producer could face life in jail if convicted. Harvey Weinstein timeline: How the scandal unfolded The horror of Weinstein's casting couch Who has accused him of what? On Wednesday, Mr Weinstein's bail sum was raised from $1m to $5m for the alleged mishandling of an electronic ankle monitor. He attended the court hearing in New York using a walking frame. His lawyers said he was undergoing surgery on Thursday for injuries suffered in a car accident in August. It is important to stress it is still not final. Details of the deal wereinitially carried in the New York Times,external, but lawyers have confirmed most of them with other US media outlets. The newspaper said the agreement had obtained preliminary approval from most of the parties involved. The main elements appear to be: The plaintiffs in the case would share in the payout, as could others who join the suit It is a global deal that would end almost all related civil lawsuits against Mr Weinstein and his previous employer Mr Weinstein would not pay personally, the sum would come from insurance firms representing the Weinstein Company Mr Weinstein would not admit wrongdoing Court approval would be required The $25m is part of a larger $47m package intended to close the Weinstein Company's liabilities, including legal fees Lawyers for Mr Weinstein and The Weinstein Company contacted by the New York Times and other media outlets have declined to comment. A group lawsuit had been brought by dozens of women who accuse Mr Weinstein of sexual harassment and abuse, though high-profile figures who have also made allegations, such as Gwyneth Paltrow and Angelina Jolie, are not part of the action. It has certainly been mixed. Genie Harrison, a lawyer for one of the plaintiffs, told the New York Times: ""I don't think there's a markedly better deal to be made."" She said other alleged victims who hold out could end up with nothing, and that they should ""come forward and be able to get the best level of compensation we were able to get"". One plaintiff backing the deal, Louisette Geiss, told Associated Press (AP) news agency: ""This settlement will ensure that all survivors have the chance for recovery and can move forward without Harvey's damaging lock on their careers."" This video can not be played Former assistants Rowena Chiu and Zelda Perkins speak about Weinstein But Zoe Brock, an actor and model involved in the case, told the BBC: ""I think the settlement is a joke and it signifies an absolutely broken system. I'm devastated by it, I'm appalled by it."" Some lawyers for plaintiffs were also unhappy with the terms. Douglas Wigdor told the BBC: ""We reject the notion that this was the best settlement that could have been achieved."" What we learned from the Weinstein documentary Untouchable He said it was ""outrageous that the proposed settlement will seek to bind non-participating members by providing a release to the insurance companies and the directors of the Weinstein Company itself"". Anti-sexual harassment campaign group Time's Up tweeted: ""If this is the best the survivors could get, the system is broken."" Mr Weinstein's criminal trial is set to begin on 6 January in Manhattan. He is accused of raping a woman in a hotel room in the New York borough in 2013, and of performing a forcible sex act on a second woman in 2006. He denies the charges. He also pleaded not guilty in August to two additional charges of predatory sexual assault over an alleged rape in 1993, although these cannot be prosecuted because of time limits. The 67-year-old has denied sexual misconduct allegations by more than 70 women. The accusations came after the New York Times published a story in October 2017detailing decades of allegations,external. Actresses Rose McGowan and Ashley Judd were among the women who came forward.

"Key questions about general election results, and how the BBC reports them, answered. By winning more seats in the House of Commons than all the other parties put together. If a party does that, it has what is known as a majority. There are 650 seats available, which means 326 seats are needed to win an overall majority. However, an effective majority could be smaller as Sinn Fein, which won seven seats in Northern Ireland in 2017, traditionally refuses to swear allegiance to the Queen and, as a consequence, is not entitled to vote. So in 2017, 650 minus Sinn Fein's seven would be 643 voting MPs, and 322 would have been enough to command a majority. But obviously that figure changes depending on how many non-voting MPs there are. Also called a seat, in a general election, this is where the political battles are fought. Voters in each constituency choose just one MP. Backbencher Term for an MP who is not a minister. They sit behind the front benches in the House of commons. Ballot Another term for vote. Ballot box A sealed box with a slit in the lid. Voters place their ballot papers through the slit into the box. When polls close the boxes are opened and counting begins. Ballot paper Paper containing a list of all candidates standing in a constituency. Voters mark their choice with a cross. By-election An election held between general elections, usually because the sitting MP has died or resigned. Candidate Someone putting themselves up for election. Once Parliament has been dissolved, there are no MPs, only candidates. Canvassing During a campaign, active supporters of a party ask voters who they will vote for and try to drum up support for their own candidates. Close of nominations The deadline for candidates standing to send in the officials forms confirming their place in the election. This is usually __ days before polling day. Coalition When two or more parties govern together, when neither has an overall majority. After the 2010 election, the Conservatives and Lib Dems formed a coalition, which lasted for five years. Confidence and supply A agreement between two political parties where the smaller party agrees to support a larger one without enough MPs to have a majority in parliament. Conservative The Conservative party is Constituency The geographical unit which elects a single MP. There are 650 in the UK. Dead cat In politics, a 'dead cat' strategy is when a dramatic or sensational story is disclosed to divert attention away from something more damaging.  The term comes from the concept of an imaginary dead cat being flung onto a dining table, causing the diners to become distracted by it. Declaration The announcement of the election result in each constituency. Deposit A sum of Â£500 paid by candidates or their parties to be allowed to stand. It is returned if the candidate wins 5% or more of the votes cast. Devolution The delegation of powers to other parliaments within the UK, specifically the Scottish Parliament and Welsh and Northern Ireland Assemblies. Devolved parliament The Scottish Parliament and Welsh and Northern Ireland assemblies are elected by voters in those nations of the UK. They make laws on policy areas controlled by those nations such as health, environment and education. Dissolution of Parliament The act of ending a Parliament before an election. When parliament is dissolved there are no MPs, but the prime minister and other senior ministers remain in their roles. Electoral register / roll A list of everyone in a constituency entitled to vote. Also known as electoral roll. Exit poll An exit poll is a poll of voters leaving a voting station. They are asked how they have voted, and the results are used to forecast what the overall result of the election may be. First past the post Term used to describe the UK's parliamentary election system. It means a candidate only needs to win the most votes in their constituency to win the seat. Gain When a party wins a constituency from another party, it is said to have ""gained"" it from the other. General election Election at which all seats in the House of Commons are contested. Hung parliament If after an election no party has an overall majority, then parliament is said to be ""hung"". The main parties will then try to form a coalition with one or more of the minor parties. Opinion polls have suggested that a hung parliament is a strong possibility after the 2015 general election. Hustings A meeting a which candidates address potential voters. The word comes from an old Norse word meaning ""house of assembly"". Independent A candidate who is not a member of any political party and is standing on their own personal platform. To qualify as an official political party, a party must be registered with the Electoral Commission, the organisation which administers elections in the UK. Landslide The name given to an election which one party wins by a very large margin. Famous landslides in UK elections include Labour's victory in 1945, the Conservative win in 1983 and the election which brought Tony Blair to power in 1997. Left wing A person or party with strong socialist policies or beliefs. Liberal Democrat The name of the party occupying the centre ground of British politics. They were formed from the former Liberal party and Social Democrats, a Labour splinter group, and combine support for traditional liberalism such as religious tolerance and individual freedom, with support for social justice. Majority A majority in Parliament means one side has at least one more vote than all the other parties combined and is therefore more likely to be able to push through any legislative plans. Majority government When one party wins more than half of the seats in the Commons, they can rule alone in a majority government Mandate Politicians say they have a mandate, or authority, to carry out a policy when they have the backing of the electorate. Manifesto A public declaration of a party's ideas and policies, usually printed during the campaign. Once in power, a government is often judged by how many of its manifesto promises it manages to deliver. Marginal Seats where the gap between the two or more leading parties is relatively small. Often regarded as less than a 10% margin or requiring a swing (see below) of 5% or less, though very dependent on prevailing political conditions. Minority government A minority government is one that does not have a majority of the seats in Parliament. It means the government is less likely to be able to push through any legislative programme. Boris Johnson has suffered a number of defeats in Parliament over a no-deal Brexit because he does not have a majority. MP Strictly this includes members of the House of Lords, but in practice means only members of the House of Commons. When an election is called Parliament is dissolved and there are no more MPs until it assembles again. Nomination papers A candidate must be nominated on these documents by 10 voters living in the constituency. Opinion poll A survey asking people's opinion on one or more issues. In an election campaign, the key question is usually about which party people will vote for. Opposition The largest party not in government is known as the official opposition. It receives extra parliamentary funding in recognition of its status. Party Election Broadcast Broadcasts made by the parties and transmitted on TV or radio. By agreement with the broadcasters, each party is allowed a certain number according to its election strength and number of candidates fielded. Percentage swing The swing shows how far voter support for a party has changed between elections. It is calculated by comparing the percentage of the vote won in a particular election to the figure obtained in the previous election. Polling day Election day Polling station Place where people go to cast their votes Postal vote People unable to get to a polling station are allowed to vote by post if they apply in advance. Proportional representation (PR) Any voting system where the share of seats represents the share of votes is described as proportional representation. The UK currently has a first past the post system. Prorogation Parliament is usually prorogued, or suspended, ahead of an election or Queen's Speech to allow for preparations. In September 2019 Boris Johnson attempted to prorogue Parliament for five weeks, but the Supreme Court later ruled the prorogation unlawful and MPs returned to Parliament. Psephologist A person who studies voting and voting patterns. Purdah This is the time between the announcement of an election and the final election results. During this period media organisations have to ensure any political reporting is balanced and is not likely to influence the outcome of the election. Recount If a result is close, any candidate may ask for a recount. The process can be repeated several times if necessary until the candidates are satisfied. The returning officer has the final say on whether a recount takes place. Returning officer The official in charge of elections in each of the constituencies. On election night they read out the results for each candidate in alphabetical order by surname. Right wing Someone who is right wing in politics usually supports tradition and authority, as well as capitalism. The Conservative party is regarded as the main centre-right party in the UK. Safe seat A safe seat is a constituency where an MP has a sufficiently large majority to be considered unwinnable by the opposition. Spin room The attempt to place a favourable interpretation on an event so that people or the media will interpret it in that way. Those performing this act are known as spin doctors. Spoiled ballot Any ballot paper that is not marked clearly, eg with more than one box ticked or with writing scrawled across it, is described as a spoiled ballot and does not count towards the result. Tactical voting This is when people vote not for the party they really support, but for another party in order to keep out a more disliked rival. Target seat In theory, any seat that a party contests and held by a rival is one of its targets. In practice, a target seat is one that a party believes it can win and puts a lot of effort into doing so. Turnout Turnout is the percentage of eligible voters who cast a ballot on polling day. Vote of no confidence It is usually the leader of the opposition, currently Jeremy Corby, who calls for a vote of no confidence, in an attempt to topple the government. If more MPs vote for the motion than against it, then the government has 14 days to try to win back the confidence of MPs through another vote â while the opposition parties try to form an alternative government. If nothing is resolved, then a general election is triggered. Westminster The UK Parliament is located in the Palace of Westminster in the centre of London and the term is often used as an alternative to Parliament. Working majority A working majority in Parliament is what a government needs to carry out its legislative programme without risk of defeat. It means the government can rely on at least one more vote than the opposition parties. However, in the current Parliament, the government no longer has a majority and MPs from a range of opposition parties have joined forces to form a parliamentary majority big enough to defeat the government over plans for a no-deal Brexit.  What is a majority? What is a hung parliament? Have constituencies changed since the last general election in 2017? What happens in the Speaker's seat? What is meant when a party wins, holds or gains a seat? What about by-elections? What about where MPs have changed parties? What is an exit poll and seat forecast? What is the cartogram telling me? Why don't vote share figures add up? How does the BBC calculate turnout? Which parties appear in the summary results graphic at the top of the BBC News website?

To do that simply one party needs to get one more seat than all the others added together. That is called an overall majority, but in the shorthand language of elections it is just called a majority. There are 650 seats in Parliament, so to get one more than everyone else put together a party must get 326 or more to get a ""majority"". Of course, it makes things much easier for a government if they have many more MPs than all the others put together. That number is called the size of the majority. So, if one party were to win 326 seats, then all the other parties added together would be 324. The majority is therefore 326 minus 324: two. So the smallest majority possible is not one seat but two. Another quick way of working this out is to take away 325 from the number of seats that the winning party has got and double the result. For example, if the winning party has 350 seats what is the majority? 350-325=25. 25x2=50. So the majority is 50. A tip for any office sweepstake on the size of the majority is never bet on an odd number. A hung Parliament happens when no single party wins a majority. A party can stay in power without an absolute majority by trying to forge an alliance with a smaller party to create a coalition government, as when David Cameron's Conservatives signed up with Nick Clegg's Liberal Democrats in 2010. Alternatively, it can aim to reach agreements with smaller parties to support it in Parliament in the event of a confidence motion aimed at bringing down the government. This can be in the form of a confidence-and-supply agreement - as with Theresa May's Conservatives and the DUP in 2017. They didn't take ministerial positions but agreed to support the party in confidence votes and budgets. Another possibility is for the biggest party to form a minority government with no agreements with other parties, and just try to form majorities in favour of each individual bill as it comes up. If no party is prepared to go down one of these paths, Parliament will be dissolved again and there will be another election. No. They haven't changed since 2010. There was a proposal to reduce the number of MPs from 650 to 600 under the coalition government, which would have meant changes to some constituency boundaries. These have not been implemented. The Speaker of the House of Commons is an MP and has to stand for re-election in his or her constituency at every general election. Traditionally the biggest parties in the House of Commons do not stand against the Speaker, although the Green Party has done so this year and in other recent elections. The new Speaker, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, is standing for election in Chorley, Lancashire. The Speaker is a neutral figure in Parliament, so Sir Lindsay is no longer a member of Labour as he was before his election to the role (by Parliament). However, for the purposes of calculating the number of seats belonging to each party - and calculating those held, gained or lost by each party - Sir Lindsay's seat is regarded as being a Labour constituency, as he won it for the party in 2017 before being elected Speaker. If Sir Lindsay wins again, the result in 2019 will be described as ""Speaker win"" - and his seat will be added to the Labour total and not included in any change calculations. This means the 326 majority target still works, as there is traditionally one deputy Speaker from the same side of the House as the Speaker, and two deputies from the opposing bench. The votes for Sir Lindsay will be added to our ""Others"" tally, however, not included for Labour. The BBC follows the same principle at every general election. What matters most is how many ""seats"" - constituencies - each party wins, and for things to change in Parliament, political parties need to win seats from each other. Because winning seats from each other is so important, a special language is used to show this. Seats that are won mainly fall into two categories: hold or gain. Hold: If a party wins a seat that it won in 2017, this is described as a ""hold"" Gain: If a party wins a seat that it did not win in 2017, this is called a ""gain"". We don't talk about losses in headline results Win: If the constituency was under different control when the election was called compared with how it was after the 2017 election we call it a ""win"". This could be either because the MP elected in 2017 had defected to a different party, or lost a by-election. We do this just so it's less confusing on an individual constituency level, but how it counts on the overall scoreboard is always in comparison with the 2017 result. More on that below By-elections are one-off elections in seats where, for example, the sitting MP has stood down or died. There have beenfive by-elections since 2017,externalbut only one - in Brecon and Radnorshire - resulted in a change of party control. When the BBC reports general election results, all of these interim by-elections are ignored, to allow for straightforward comparison with 2017's seats. The BBC uses slightly different terminology to describe results where seats have changed hands in by-elections. For example, in Brecon and Radnorshire, Liberal Democrat Jane Dodds won from Conservative Chris Davies. If the Conservative candidate regains the seat on 12 December, the result will be described as a ""Conservative win"". Likewise if Ms Dodds wins again that will go down as a ""Liberal Democrat win"". It would not appear as a net gain in the Conservatives' overall UK seat tally if they win, but if the Lib Dems win that will give them a +1 in the gains total, and the Conservatives -1. However, if an entirely different party wins a by-election seat, that result will be described as a ""gain"" from whichever party won the seat in 2017. It's a similar situation where an MP has changed party but is standing in the same seat as before. More about that below. The BBC adopts this policy in recognition of the very particular circumstances which often shape the outcome of by-elections. Comparing seat changes from 2017 is a fairer way of representing how the political expression of voters has altered from general election to general election. Despite it only having been two-and-a-half years since the last election, more MPs have changed parties than in any Parliamentary term since 1886 when the Liberals split over the issue of Home Rule in Ireland. Several Labour and Conservative members unhappy with the Brexit process left to form the Independent Group last February, since then they have been called Change UK and now the Independent Group for Change. They have three candidates standing in this campaign. Others have joined the Lib Dems or become Independents, and there has also been a considerable number of MPs suspended or expelled from their parties due to internal disciplinary procedures. For the purposes of calculating change in seats, we will compare these areas with how they were immediately after the 2017 election. Let's use the case of Chuka Umunna as an example. He won Streatham in London for Labour in 2017, but has been a Liberal Democrat MP since June. For this election, he's running in the Cities of London and Westminster seat won by the Conservative Mark Field in 2017. If Mr Umunna wins there this time around, that will count as a Liberal Democrat gain and a Conservative loss, even though he would have been a sitting MP before and after the election. If the new Labour candidate for Streatham wins, that will be a Labour hold rather than Lib Dem loss. If the defected MP were to run in the same constituency they won in 2017, that would be treated similarly to the way we deal with by-elections, explained above. We would describe it as a ""win"", rather than a hold or gain, for whoever gets the most votes, but for the overall change tallies for the parties we would compare it against the result in the constituency in 2017. An exit poll is conducted by approaching voters as they leave polling stations and asking them to fill in a mock ballot paper to indicate how they have just voted. The exit poll is carried out by polling company Ipsos Mori for the BBC, ITV News and Sky News. The poll is carried out in Great Britain only, so there are no seat forecasts for the Northern Irish parties. The results of the exit poll will allow BBC analysts to forecast approximately how many seats each party has won. The technology has changed, but the principles remain Constituencies in the UK are supposed to have broadly similar numbers of people living in them. There are exceptions for island constituencies, like the Isle of Wight (the biggest seat by population) and Na h-Eileanan an Iar (Western Isles) in Scotland, (the smallest). But in general there are about 70,000 eligible voters in constituencies in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland, and an average of 56,000 in Wales. Each seat has equal value in the House of Commons, but the way you view them on a map can be quite skewed - rural areas where populations are more spread out take up more space than inner city ones, for example. The cartogram is a way of viewing each seat as equal size, while attempting to show roughly where in the UK they are. There are some, mostly around London - whose high population density distorts the map most significantly - that are in different places to where you'd expect, no longer neighbouring the seats they lie next to geographically. All the seats are correctly within the right nation and English region, but they are occasionally arranged strangely within that. On national and constituency scoreboards you may find that if you add all the vote share gains and losses together they don't equal zero, and it's not clear where extra votes have come from. That's because we only include vote share changes for parties or independents that are running in this election. So in a constituency where a certain party is not standing this year but they stood in 2017, like UKIP and the Lib Dems in Beaconsfield, the 11% they won between them in 2017 won't be accounted for in the change figures. The figures for the parties that are running this year will all be correct individually though. If a party or independent is running this year but didn't run in 2017, their vote share change figure will be the same as their vote share because it is in effect an increase from zero. The seats change totals will always sum to zero at a national or regional level, even where there are Independents who won seats in 2017 that aren't standing this time, like Lady Sylvia Hermon in North Down. On election night, the BBC calculates percentage turnout by dividing the number of valid votes cast for all candidates by the number of people eligible to vote (known as the electorate). Spoilt or rejected ballots are not included. The UK and nations turnout figures are updated through the night, based on electorates divided by valid votes of all constituencies declared so far. When polls close at 22:00 GMT, the BBC will broadcast the results of the exit poll. The projected seats for the top five parties based on the exit poll will be displayed in the summary graphic as grey bars. When the first results are declared, around an hour later, parties will begin to be ordered left to right by number of seats won at that time, with the number of votes received as a tie-breaker if they're level on seats. As the night progresses, the summary results graphic will always display the top five parties according to seats won. All other parties' seats will be amalgamated into ""Others"". When we get closer to the end of the night, the predictions will be switched off and we'll just be left with a bar chart summing up the results. Full UK results are always available via the link to the results homepage, which contains party listings and breakdown of seats, votes and vote share by party. There are also separate results pages for each of the four nations in the UK, and one for every constituency. We also publish results for Wales and the 40 Welsh constituencies in Welsh. To appear as a named party in either the overall UK scoreboard or a nation scoreboard, a party must fulfil one of the following criteria: Standing in one-sixth of seats in any UK nation Fielding more than five candidates either across the UK or in a single nation Achieved greater than 1% of the vote at UK or nation level at the last general election Had a sitting MP in the last Parliament All parties which do not meet these criteria are amalgamated into a group called Others, including the 224 independents running this year. Each constituency page will always name every party and independent standing in that constituency. The BBC only recognises parties which are registered as political parties by the Electoral Commission. The postcode search box uses the latest available data supplied by Ordnance Survey. Discrepancies can occasionally occur when a postcode search returns a different constituency to the one given on polling cards sent to an address at the same postcode. Normally the constituencies concerned are next to each other, and it appears these discrepancies occur when postcodes are on the border between the two constituencies. We would advise people affected to follow the information on their polling card in terms of the constituency they are in and the polling place to be used on 12 December. Where possible we try to use full party names, but in some places we have to shorten them so they fit better. Some are easier to guess than others, here are what they all mean (ordered by the parties standing the most candidates this time around): CON - Conservatives LAB - Labour LD - Liberal Democrats GRN - Green Party BRX - The Brexit Party IND - Independents (any individual candidate not affiliated to a party registered with the Electoral Commission) SNP - Scottish National Party UKIP - UKIP PC - Plaid Cymru CPA - Christian Peoples Alliance YRKS - Yorkshire Party MRLP - Monster Raving Loony Party SDP - Social Democratic Party LIB - Liberal Party APNI - Alliance Party DUP - Democratic Unionist Party UUP - Ulster Unionist Party SDLP - Social Democratic & Labour Party SF - Sinn Fein AONT - AontÃº ANWP - Animal Welfare Party LBT - Libertarian ADV - Advance Together ED - English Democrats WRP - Workers Revolutionary Party REN - Renew AGS - Alliance for Green Socialism GWLD - Gwlad Gwlad JACP - Justice & Anti-Corruption Party [The] SEQ - Socialist Equality TIG - Independent Group for Change WEP - Women's Equality Party YPP - Young People's Party CHP - Christian Party CLGB - Communist League CMU - Communities United NE - North East Party PBP - People Before Profit POS - Proud of Oldham & Saddleworth PP - The Peace Party SFP - Scottish Family Party SPGB - Socialist Party of Great Britain VPP - Veterans and People's Party YESH - Yeshua SPK - Speaker ASH - Ashfield Independents BNP - British National Party BPI - Burnley & Padiham Independent Party BSJP - Birkenhead Social Justice Party CF - CumbriaFirst CMEP - Church of the Militant Elvis Party CMUK - Citizens Movement Party UK CP - The Common People CVP - The Cynon Valley Party HWDI - Heavy Woollen District Independents INET - Independent Network LNIN - Lincolnshire Independents LUTN - Best for Luton MK - Mebyon Kernow MTHR - Motherworld Party PATR - Patria PFP - Psychedelic Future Party RBD - Rebooting Democracy SHRP - Shropshire Party SLP - Socialist Labour Party SNAV - Space Navies Party TCRP - The Constitution and Reform Party TLW - Touch Love Worldwide UGP - The Universal Good Party WY - Wycombe Independents LA mayor says winds and drought created 'perfect storm', while officials hit out at looters Climate 'whiplash' linked to raging LA fires Watch: The moment five US presidents gather at Jimmy Carter's funeral The '9/11 mastermind' is set to plead guilty.

"Pharmacists are calling for better regulation of products claiming to contain cannabis derivative CBD. There has been a spike in demand within the last twelve months, according to manufacturers. Non-medicinal CBD is now on sale in High Street shops across the country, including chemists. But the National Pharmacy Association says the products need clearer information and better checks on content. CBD - cannabidiol - isn't marketed as medicinal cannabis. It doesn't have a psychoactive element that makes the user high. Some studies indicate it can help with childhood epilepsy seizures,external, and other people think it helps them too. Cannabidiol oil is being added to a range of products - from water, to chocolate, to make-up, tea and coffee. Manufacturers claim sales in the UK are as much as Â£300m at the moment. It's illegal to print any health claims on the products, but it's a grey area as to who checks the ingredients, or the amount of CBD oil actually contained in each product, many of which can be very expensive. Jasmine Shah from the National Pharmacy Association, which represents hundreds of independent pharmacies, says an increasing number of pharmacists are stocking CBD products, despite the fact that she says ""at the moment there is very limited research on the safety and efficacy of these products"". She says pharmacists would like ""clear authoritative guidance which makes it easy for healthcare professions, consumers and patients to make informed choices"". CBD is classed as a food supplement, so it's governed by the Food Standards Agency. Because it's a brand-new type of food there's a grace period, where it's allowed to be sold in stores, but the FSA has now asked manufacturers to give specific information about the product. Manufacturers will have to include important scientific details like what it contains, purity levels, manufacturing practices, as well as providing detailed information to demonstrate it is safe for people to consume. The FSA says that despite ample time and repeated requests to CBD manufacturers they've not heard enough from any company in this multimillion pound industry to give them authorisation yet. That leaves those selling the product in a difficult position.  Ms Shah doesn't think that selling CBD in pharmacies gives the products extra legitimacy. She says ""It's for each pharmacist to decide whether its suitable to stock a CBD product or not, but in terms of the safety and efficacy of it more research is required."" The Association for the Cannabinoid Industry is a new group representing around 20 CBD brands. It says members are ""unequivocally committed to achieving Novel Foods status via the Food Standards Agency"". But the FSA appears to be losing patience with the industry and said it expects ""companies to comply with the novel foods process, which includes submitting safety information about their products"". ""The FSA is considering the best way to ensure CBD food-related products currently on the market move towards compliance,"" it added. In the meantime, customers buying any CBD product have no guarantees if the product is safe, or indeed if it contains any CBD oil at all. Does cannabis lead to harder drug use?

Past winners includes Adele, Sam Smith, Years & Years, 50 Cent, Sigrid and, earlier this year, Octavian. It is voted for by 170 music critics, broadcasters and DJs, as well as former nominees such as Billie Eilish, Lewis Capaldi and Chvrches. Celeste has been hotly tipped following the success of her heart-rending single Strange The 2020 selection sees a retreat from grime and UK rap, which had established a strong presence on the list over the last five years. In their place are a clutch of female artists who represent the rise of British R&B - from the sweet-but-gritty sounds ofJoy Crookesto the soulful poetry ofArlo Parks. But the one to beat is Celeste, a""shy singer with a star's voice"",external, who has already won the Brits' Rising Star award and been named BBC Music Introducing's artist of the year. Hailing from Dublin, Inhaler have built an impressive live following since forming at school over a shared love of bands like Joy Division, The Strokes, The Stone Roses and The Cure. Once you know the U2 connection, it's hard not to notice the similarities between Eli Hewson's soaring vocals and those of his father - but the band have worked hard to stand on their own two feet. ""For me and for us as a band, we've known that there's going to be doors open,""Hewson told the NME,external. ""But those doors will shut just as fast as they open if we're not good.""

Yungblud has built up a huge following with singles like Original Me and 11 Minutes The Doncaster-born singer is the most high-profile name on the 2020 longlist, with 11 million monthly listeners on Spotify  - more than all the other artists combined. Born Dominic Harrison, the 22-year-old has positioned himself as the voice of a generation, singing about topics like sexual assault, corporate greed, anxiety and ""the underrated youth"". ""I never want to be predictable,""he told the BBC earlier this year. ""If people know what I'm going to do next, then I'm completely shafted.""

"Security forces were called in when Greenpeace protesters scaled the summit building and unfurled a banner European Union leaders are holding talks in Brussels amid pressure to commit to making the 28-member bloc climate neutral by 2050. Several Eastern European countries want financial and other guarantees before they agree to the EU cutting to zero its net amount of greenhouse emissions. But Ursula von der Leyen, the new head of the EU's executive, has placed the aim at the heart of a new ""Green Deal"". Billions of euros would be added to the EU budget to move from fossil fuels. The ""Just Transition Mechanism"" would include funding from the European Investment Bank and would support states such as Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary, which are among the EU member states most reliant on coal. Arriving for the summit, Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis said he would seek assurances that Prague could continue to pursue nuclear power. Hungary's Viktor Orban was adamant that ""poor people and poor countries"" should not bear the financial cost of fighting climate change. President Emmanuel Macron of France, which relies on nuclear power for almost three-quarters of its electricity needs, said it was obvious that nuclear power would have to stay, as long as the right mechanism was found. Austria's chancellor agreed. Anger as protesters barred from UN climate talks EU aims to be 'climate neutral' by 2050 Ahead of the summit, Greenpeace activists used an old fire engine to climb the European Council building, before unfurling a banner reading ""climate emergency"" and setting off flares. The protesters complained the EU was doing too little, too late. Poland is among the EU nations that is seeking billions in EU funds to help move away from fossil fuels The new president of the European Council, Charles Michel, said ahead of the summit that he wanted EU leaders to pledge that the bloc would become climate neutral by 2050. Climate neutrality, he said, would be ""a strong signal for the future of Europe"" showing the need to ""massively"" invest in innovation as officials and experts meet in Madrid for the UN climate summit. This video can not be played Finland's PM said she hoped leaders would agree a common goal Finland's new Prime Minister Sanna Marin said new generations expected the EU to act - and it had to act faster. TheEuropean Green Deal,externalwas described by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen as Europe's ""man on the Moon"" moment. It includes: A â¬100bn (Â£84bn; $110bn) Just Transition Mechanism to help countries still heavily dependent on fossil fuels and ""carbon-intensive processes"" to move to renewable energy sources Proposals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 50% of 1990 levels or even lower by 2030 - instead of the current target of 40% A law that would set the EU ""on to an irreversible path to climate neutrality"" by 2050 A plan to promote a more circular economy - a system designed to eliminate waste - that would address more sustainable products as well as a ""farm to fork"" strategy to improve the sustainability of food production and distribution Although the new Commission's proposals are ambitious, they have to be signed off by EU leaders if they are to get anywhere. An official said on the eve of the summit that there might or might not be a deal in Brussels. The test was whether EU leaders were prepared to make a commitment before negotiations on the 2021-27 EU budget came to an end. Greta Thunberg addresses COP25 summit in Madrid Negotiators 'playing politics' amid climate crisis Climate neutrality involves balancing emissions by removing warming gases from the atmosphere. Warming emissions created by cars and power plants are counteracted by removing greenhouse gases from the air by planting new forests or through carbon capture technologies that bury CO2 underground. One of the big problems EU leaders will have is finding the money from a budget that is already set to shrink if the UK leaves the bloc next year. There was no UK prime minister at Thursday's summit because of the general election. Polish MEP Ryszard Legutko pours cold water on the ideas of the new head of the European Commission Polish officials have already welcomed the planned mechanism for compensating countries whose economies are still reliant on the coal industry. Coal currently produces 80% of Poland's power. However, they say the cost of transition for Poland in particular will be huge, and it is not just one budget that would need to carry the cost but budgets all the way through to 2050. A sign of the scepticism came from Ryszard Legutko, an MEP from Poland's ruling Law and Justice party, who told the European Parliament on Wednesday that the strategy was confused and prompted more questions than it answered. ""Have you any idea of the social cost as well as the personal tragedies it will generate?"" he asked the Commission president. It is not just Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic that have reservations. Romanian MEP Dan Nica warned that if his country was to meet its 2030 target, it would cost 40% of its economic output, with a price of almost â¬8bn a year. Families living near mining areas would be particularly affected, he said.

"""This year I have taken two hangover days when I've been out with my friends, and I've taken three from when I've been out on work nights."" Ellie is 19 and works as a PR manager for a digital marketing agency. Like a growing number of employers, her boss offers flexible working arrangements, including flexible hours and unlimited holiday. It also lets employees take ""hangover days"" where they work from the comfort of their own sofa - or even bed. ""The perk has a lot in it,"" Ellie told BBC 5 Live's Wake Up To Money. ""It is about honesty, it's about people being able to not lie to their managers. ""But also, the idea behind it is that parents have a lot of perks at our business but there are not necessarily any for people who don't have children. ""So this is a perk for people who don't have kids."" Ellie's boss is Claire Crompton, co-founder and director of The Audit Lab. The company is based in Bolton and she says that offering attractive perks is key to attracting talent out of Manchester. ""We wanted to offer something to younger millennials who typically go out mid-week and do the pub quiz. My team book a hangover day in advance, if they know they are going out. ""They just work in their PJs, sat at home on the couch,"" she said. Claire Crompton (purple dress) and some of her team at Audit Lab Claire added: ""If people used it two or three times a week and missed important client meetings then we'd have to have a think. But everyone has been really respectful of it so far. ""It's basically a work-from-home day, but we've sexed it up a bit to appeal to the younger generation,"" she said. ""It promotes honesty as well."" For Claire, one of the motivations is the expectation that staff will sometimes go out in the evening for work events and client entertainment. About 84% of official workplace social events involve alcohol, according to research carried out for the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, and shown exclusively to Wake Up To Money. With the Christmas party season in full flow, 40% of businesses that are planning a Christmas event say that alcohol will be freely available and paid for by the company, while 39% say alcohol will be available to buy with no limit. The impact can be positive and negative. Four out of 10 HR managers surveyed said that alcohol can cause problems at work. But almost 50% of the managers said having some drinks at social events had a positive effect on morale and team bonding. Dr Jill Miller, diversity and inclusion adviser at the CIPD, thinks the branding could cause concerns. ""Focusing on flexible working is really positive, especially showing it's not just for working parents,"" she says. ""Looking at why each age group wants flexibility is important. ""But labelling them as 'hangover days' might not be as helpful if it's encouraging excessive alcohol consumption. Employers have a duty of care and need to consider that when designing policies. Is it promoting drinking? I'd suggest a rethink on the labelling."" Ellie says it's not a benefit anyone would think to abuse.

"Key questions about general election results, and how the BBC reports them, answered. By winning more seats in the House of Commons than all the other parties put together. If a party does that, it has what is known as a majority. There are 650 seats available, which means 326 seats are needed to win an overall majority. However, an effective majority could be smaller as Sinn Fein, which won seven seats in Northern Ireland in 2017, traditionally refuses to swear allegiance to the Queen and, as a consequence, is not entitled to vote. So in 2017, 650 minus Sinn Fein's seven would be 643 voting MPs, and 322 would have been enough to command a majority. But obviously that figure changes depending on how many non-voting MPs there are. Also called a seat, in a general election, this is where the political battles are fought. Voters in each constituency choose just one MP. Backbencher Term for an MP who is not a minister. They sit behind the front benches in the House of commons. Ballot Another term for vote. Ballot box A sealed box with a slit in the lid. Voters place their ballot papers through the slit into the box. When polls close the boxes are opened and counting begins. Ballot paper Paper containing a list of all candidates standing in a constituency. Voters mark their choice with a cross. By-election An election held between general elections, usually because the sitting MP has died or resigned. Candidate Someone putting themselves up for election. Once Parliament has been dissolved, there are no MPs, only candidates. Canvassing During a campaign, active supporters of a party ask voters who they will vote for and try to drum up support for their own candidates. Close of nominations The deadline for candidates standing to send in the officials forms confirming their place in the election. This is usually __ days before polling day. Coalition When two or more parties govern together, when neither has an overall majority. After the 2010 election, the Conservatives and Lib Dems formed a coalition, which lasted for five years. Confidence and supply A agreement between two political parties where the smaller party agrees to support a larger one without enough MPs to have a majority in parliament. Conservative The Conservative party is Constituency The geographical unit which elects a single MP. There are 650 in the UK. Dead cat In politics, a 'dead cat' strategy is when a dramatic or sensational story is disclosed to divert attention away from something more damaging.  The term comes from the concept of an imaginary dead cat being flung onto a dining table, causing the diners to become distracted by it. Declaration The announcement of the election result in each constituency. Deposit A sum of Â£500 paid by candidates or their parties to be allowed to stand. It is returned if the candidate wins 5% or more of the votes cast. Devolution The delegation of powers to other parliaments within the UK, specifically the Scottish Parliament and Welsh and Northern Ireland Assemblies. Devolved parliament The Scottish Parliament and Welsh and Northern Ireland assemblies are elected by voters in those nations of the UK. They make laws on policy areas controlled by those nations such as health, environment and education. Dissolution of Parliament The act of ending a Parliament before an election. When parliament is dissolved there are no MPs, but the prime minister and other senior ministers remain in their roles. Electoral register / roll A list of everyone in a constituency entitled to vote. Also known as electoral roll. Exit poll An exit poll is a poll of voters leaving a voting station. They are asked how they have voted, and the results are used to forecast what the overall result of the election may be. First past the post Term used to describe the UK's parliamentary election system. It means a candidate only needs to win the most votes in their constituency to win the seat. Gain When a party wins a constituency from another party, it is said to have ""gained"" it from the other. General election Election at which all seats in the House of Commons are contested. Hung parliament If after an election no party has an overall majority, then parliament is said to be ""hung"". The main parties will then try to form a coalition with one or more of the minor parties. Opinion polls have suggested that a hung parliament is a strong possibility after the 2015 general election. Hustings A meeting a which candidates address potential voters. The word comes from an old Norse word meaning ""house of assembly"". Independent A candidate who is not a member of any political party and is standing on their own personal platform. To qualify as an official political party, a party must be registered with the Electoral Commission, the organisation which administers elections in the UK. Landslide The name given to an election which one party wins by a very large margin. Famous landslides in UK elections include Labour's victory in 1945, the Conservative win in 1983 and the election which brought Tony Blair to power in 1997. Left wing A person or party with strong socialist policies or beliefs. Liberal Democrat The name of the party occupying the centre ground of British politics. They were formed from the former Liberal party and Social Democrats, a Labour splinter group, and combine support for traditional liberalism such as religious tolerance and individual freedom, with support for social justice. Majority A majority in Parliament means one side has at least one more vote than all the other parties combined and is therefore more likely to be able to push through any legislative plans. Majority government When one party wins more than half of the seats in the Commons, they can rule alone in a majority government Mandate Politicians say they have a mandate, or authority, to carry out a policy when they have the backing of the electorate. Manifesto A public declaration of a party's ideas and policies, usually printed during the campaign. Once in power, a government is often judged by how many of its manifesto promises it manages to deliver. Marginal Seats where the gap between the two or more leading parties is relatively small. Often regarded as less than a 10% margin or requiring a swing (see below) of 5% or less, though very dependent on prevailing political conditions. Minority government A minority government is one that does not have a majority of the seats in Parliament. It means the government is less likely to be able to push through any legislative programme. Boris Johnson has suffered a number of defeats in Parliament over a no-deal Brexit because he does not have a majority. MP Strictly this includes members of the House of Lords, but in practice means only members of the House of Commons. When an election is called Parliament is dissolved and there are no more MPs until it assembles again. Nomination papers A candidate must be nominated on these documents by 10 voters living in the constituency. Opinion poll A survey asking people's opinion on one or more issues. In an election campaign, the key question is usually about which party people will vote for. Opposition The largest party not in government is known as the official opposition. It receives extra parliamentary funding in recognition of its status. Party Election Broadcast Broadcasts made by the parties and transmitted on TV or radio. By agreement with the broadcasters, each party is allowed a certain number according to its election strength and number of candidates fielded. Percentage swing The swing shows how far voter support for a party has changed between elections. It is calculated by comparing the percentage of the vote won in a particular election to the figure obtained in the previous election. Polling day Election day Polling station Place where people go to cast their votes Postal vote People unable to get to a polling station are allowed to vote by post if they apply in advance. Proportional representation (PR) Any voting system where the share of seats represents the share of votes is described as proportional representation. The UK currently has a first past the post system. Prorogation Parliament is usually prorogued, or suspended, ahead of an election or Queen's Speech to allow for preparations. In September 2019 Boris Johnson attempted to prorogue Parliament for five weeks, but the Supreme Court later ruled the prorogation unlawful and MPs returned to Parliament. Psephologist A person who studies voting and voting patterns. Purdah This is the time between the announcement of an election and the final election results. During this period media organisations have to ensure any political reporting is balanced and is not likely to influence the outcome of the election. Recount If a result is close, any candidate may ask for a recount. The process can be repeated several times if necessary until the candidates are satisfied. The returning officer has the final say on whether a recount takes place. Returning officer The official in charge of elections in each of the constituencies. On election night they read out the results for each candidate in alphabetical order by surname. Right wing Someone who is right wing in politics usually supports tradition and authority, as well as capitalism. The Conservative party is regarded as the main centre-right party in the UK. Safe seat A safe seat is a constituency where an MP has a sufficiently large majority to be considered unwinnable by the opposition. Spin room The attempt to place a favourable interpretation on an event so that people or the media will interpret it in that way. Those performing this act are known as spin doctors. Spoiled ballot Any ballot paper that is not marked clearly, eg with more than one box ticked or with writing scrawled across it, is described as a spoiled ballot and does not count towards the result. Tactical voting This is when people vote not for the party they really support, but for another party in order to keep out a more disliked rival. Target seat In theory, any seat that a party contests and held by a rival is one of its targets. In practice, a target seat is one that a party believes it can win and puts a lot of effort into doing so. Turnout Turnout is the percentage of eligible voters who cast a ballot on polling day. Vote of no confidence It is usually the leader of the opposition, currently Jeremy Corby, who calls for a vote of no confidence, in an attempt to topple the government. If more MPs vote for the motion than against it, then the government has 14 days to try to win back the confidence of MPs through another vote â while the opposition parties try to form an alternative government. If nothing is resolved, then a general election is triggered. Westminster The UK Parliament is located in the Palace of Westminster in the centre of London and the term is often used as an alternative to Parliament. Working majority A working majority in Parliament is what a government needs to carry out its legislative programme without risk of defeat. It means the government can rely on at least one more vote than the opposition parties. However, in the current Parliament, the government no longer has a majority and MPs from a range of opposition parties have joined forces to form a parliamentary majority big enough to defeat the government over plans for a no-deal Brexit.  What is a majority? What is a hung parliament? Have constituencies changed since the last general election in 2017? What happens in the Speaker's seat? What is meant when a party wins, holds or gains a seat? What about by-elections? What about where MPs have changed parties? What is an exit poll and seat forecast? What is the cartogram telling me? Why don't vote share figures add up? How does the BBC calculate turnout? Which parties appear in the summary results graphic at the top of the BBC News website?

To do that simply one party needs to get one more seat than all the others added together. That is called an overall majority, but in the shorthand language of elections it is just called a majority. There are 650 seats in Parliament, so to get one more than everyone else put together a party must get 326 or more to get a ""majority"". Of course, it makes things much easier for a government if they have many more MPs than all the others put together. That number is called the size of the majority. So, if one party were to win 326 seats, then all the other parties added together would be 324. The majority is therefore 326 minus 324: two. So the smallest majority possible is not one seat but two. Another quick way of working this out is to take away 325 from the number of seats that the winning party has got and double the result. For example, if the winning party has 350 seats what is the majority? 350-325=25. 25x2=50. So the majority is 50. A tip for any office sweepstake on the size of the majority is never bet on an odd number. A hung Parliament happens when no single party wins a majority. A party can stay in power without an absolute majority by trying to forge an alliance with a smaller party to create a coalition government, as when David Cameron's Conservatives signed up with Nick Clegg's Liberal Democrats in 2010. Alternatively, it can aim to reach agreements with smaller parties to support it in Parliament in the event of a confidence motion aimed at bringing down the government. This can be in the form of a confidence-and-supply agreement - as with Theresa May's Conservatives and the DUP in 2017. They didn't take ministerial positions but agreed to support the party in confidence votes and budgets. Another possibility is for the biggest party to form a minority government with no agreements with other parties, and just try to form majorities in favour of each individual bill as it comes up. If no party is prepared to go down one of these paths, Parliament will be dissolved again and there will be another election. No. They haven't changed since 2010. There was a proposal to reduce the number of MPs from 650 to 600 under the coalition government, which would have meant changes to some constituency boundaries. These have not been implemented. The Speaker of the House of Commons is an MP and has to stand for re-election in his or her constituency at every general election. Traditionally the biggest parties in the House of Commons do not stand against the Speaker, although the Green Party has done so this year and in other recent elections. The new Speaker, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, is standing for election in Chorley, Lancashire. The Speaker is a neutral figure in Parliament, so Sir Lindsay is no longer a member of Labour as he was before his election to the role (by Parliament). However, for the purposes of calculating the number of seats belonging to each party - and calculating those held, gained or lost by each party - Sir Lindsay's seat is regarded as being a Labour constituency, as he won it for the party in 2017 before being elected Speaker. If Sir Lindsay wins again, the result in 2019 will be described as ""Speaker win"" - and his seat will be added to the Labour total and not included in any change calculations. This means the 326 majority target still works, as there is traditionally one deputy Speaker from the same side of the House as the Speaker, and two deputies from the opposing bench. The votes for Sir Lindsay will be added to our ""Others"" tally, however, not included for Labour. The BBC follows the same principle at every general election. What matters most is how many ""seats"" - constituencies - each party wins, and for things to change in Parliament, political parties need to win seats from each other. Because winning seats from each other is so important, a special language is used to show this. Seats that are won mainly fall into two categories: hold or gain. Hold: If a party wins a seat that it won in 2017, this is described as a ""hold"" Gain: If a party wins a seat that it did not win in 2017, this is called a ""gain"". We don't talk about losses in headline results Win: If the constituency was under different control when the election was called compared with how it was after the 2017 election we call it a ""win"". This could be either because the MP elected in 2017 had defected to a different party, or lost a by-election. We do this just so it's less confusing on an individual constituency level, but how it counts on the overall scoreboard is always in comparison with the 2017 result. More on that below By-elections are one-off elections in seats where, for example, the sitting MP has stood down or died. There have beenfive by-elections since 2017,externalbut only one - in Brecon and Radnorshire - resulted in a change of party control. When the BBC reports general election results, all of these interim by-elections are ignored, to allow for straightforward comparison with 2017's seats. The BBC uses slightly different terminology to describe results where seats have changed hands in by-elections. For example, in Brecon and Radnorshire, Liberal Democrat Jane Dodds won from Conservative Chris Davies. If the Conservative candidate regains the seat on 12 December, the result will be described as a ""Conservative win"". Likewise if Ms Dodds wins again that will go down as a ""Liberal Democrat win"". It would not appear as a net gain in the Conservatives' overall UK seat tally if they win, but if the Lib Dems win that will give them a +1 in the gains total, and the Conservatives -1. However, if an entirely different party wins a by-election seat, that result will be described as a ""gain"" from whichever party won the seat in 2017. It's a similar situation where an MP has changed party but is standing in the same seat as before. More about that below. The BBC adopts this policy in recognition of the very particular circumstances which often shape the outcome of by-elections. Comparing seat changes from 2017 is a fairer way of representing how the political expression of voters has altered from general election to general election. Despite it only having been two-and-a-half years since the last election, more MPs have changed parties than in any Parliamentary term since 1886 when the Liberals split over the issue of Home Rule in Ireland. Several Labour and Conservative members unhappy with the Brexit process left to form the Independent Group last February, since then they have been called Change UK and now the Independent Group for Change. They have three candidates standing in this campaign. Others have joined the Lib Dems or become Independents, and there has also been a considerable number of MPs suspended or expelled from their parties due to internal disciplinary procedures. For the purposes of calculating change in seats, we will compare these areas with how they were immediately after the 2017 election. Let's use the case of Chuka Umunna as an example. He won Streatham in London for Labour in 2017, but has been a Liberal Democrat MP since June. For this election, he's running in the Cities of London and Westminster seat won by the Conservative Mark Field in 2017. If Mr Umunna wins there this time around, that will count as a Liberal Democrat gain and a Conservative loss, even though he would have been a sitting MP before and after the election. If the new Labour candidate for Streatham wins, that will be a Labour hold rather than Lib Dem loss. If the defected MP were to run in the same constituency they won in 2017, that would be treated similarly to the way we deal with by-elections, explained above. We would describe it as a ""win"", rather than a hold or gain, for whoever gets the most votes, but for the overall change tallies for the parties we would compare it against the result in the constituency in 2017. An exit poll is conducted by approaching voters as they leave polling stations and asking them to fill in a mock ballot paper to indicate how they have just voted. The exit poll is carried out by polling company Ipsos Mori for the BBC, ITV News and Sky News. The poll is carried out in Great Britain only, so there are no seat forecasts for the Northern Irish parties. The results of the exit poll will allow BBC analysts to forecast approximately how many seats each party has won. The technology has changed, but the principles remain Constituencies in the UK are supposed to have broadly similar numbers of people living in them. There are exceptions for island constituencies, like the Isle of Wight (the biggest seat by population) and Na h-Eileanan an Iar (Western Isles) in Scotland, (the smallest). But in general there are about 70,000 eligible voters in constituencies in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland, and an average of 56,000 in Wales. Each seat has equal value in the House of Commons, but the way you view them on a map can be quite skewed - rural areas where populations are more spread out take up more space than inner city ones, for example. The cartogram is a way of viewing each seat as equal size, while attempting to show roughly where in the UK they are. There are some, mostly around London - whose high population density distorts the map most significantly - that are in different places to where you'd expect, no longer neighbouring the seats they lie next to geographically. All the seats are correctly within the right nation and English region, but they are occasionally arranged strangely within that. On national and constituency scoreboards you may find that if you add all the vote share gains and losses together they don't equal zero, and it's not clear where extra votes have come from. That's because we only include vote share changes for parties or independents that are running in this election. So in a constituency where a certain party is not standing this year but they stood in 2017, like UKIP and the Lib Dems in Beaconsfield, the 11% they won between them in 2017 won't be accounted for in the change figures. The figures for the parties that are running this year will all be correct individually though. If a party or independent is running this year but didn't run in 2017, their vote share change figure will be the same as their vote share because it is in effect an increase from zero. The seats change totals will always sum to zero at a national or regional level, even where there are Independents who won seats in 2017 that aren't standing this time, like Lady Sylvia Hermon in North Down. On election night, the BBC calculates percentage turnout by dividing the number of valid votes cast for all candidates by the number of people eligible to vote (known as the electorate). Spoilt or rejected ballots are not included. The UK and nations turnout figures are updated through the night, based on electorates divided by valid votes of all constituencies declared so far. When polls close at 22:00 GMT, the BBC will broadcast the results of the exit poll. The projected seats for the top five parties based on the exit poll will be displayed in the summary graphic as grey bars. When the first results are declared, around an hour later, parties will begin to be ordered left to right by number of seats won at that time, with the number of votes received as a tie-breaker if they're level on seats. As the night progresses, the summary results graphic will always display the top five parties according to seats won. All other parties' seats will be amalgamated into ""Others"". When we get closer to the end of the night, the predictions will be switched off and we'll just be left with a bar chart summing up the results. Full UK results are always available via the link to the results homepage, which contains party listings and breakdown of seats, votes and vote share by party. There are also separate results pages for each of the four nations in the UK, and one for every constituency. We also publish results for Wales and the 40 Welsh constituencies in Welsh. To appear as a named party in either the overall UK scoreboard or a nation scoreboard, a party must fulfil one of the following criteria: Standing in one-sixth of seats in any UK nation Fielding more than five candidates either across the UK or in a single nation Achieved greater than 1% of the vote at UK or nation level at the last general election Had a sitting MP in the last Parliament All parties which do not meet these criteria are amalgamated into a group called Others, including the 224 independents running this year. Each constituency page will always name every party and independent standing in that constituency. The BBC only recognises parties which are registered as political parties by the Electoral Commission. The postcode search box uses the latest available data supplied by Ordnance Survey. Discrepancies can occasionally occur when a postcode search returns a different constituency to the one given on polling cards sent to an address at the same postcode. Normally the constituencies concerned are next to each other, and it appears these discrepancies occur when postcodes are on the border between the two constituencies. We would advise people affected to follow the information on their polling card in terms of the constituency they are in and the polling place to be used on 12 December. Where possible we try to use full party names, but in some places we have to shorten them so they fit better. Some are easier to guess than others, here are what they all mean (ordered by the parties standing the most candidates this time around): CON - Conservatives LAB - Labour LD - Liberal Democrats GRN - Green Party BRX - The Brexit Party IND - Independents (any individual candidate not affiliated to a party registered with the Electoral Commission) SNP - Scottish National Party UKIP - UKIP PC - Plaid Cymru CPA - Christian Peoples Alliance YRKS - Yorkshire Party MRLP - Monster Raving Loony Party SDP - Social Democratic Party LIB - Liberal Party APNI - Alliance Party DUP - Democratic Unionist Party UUP - Ulster Unionist Party SDLP - Social Democratic & Labour Party SF - Sinn Fein AONT - AontÃº ANWP - Animal Welfare Party LBT - Libertarian ADV - Advance Together ED - English Democrats WRP - Workers Revolutionary Party REN - Renew AGS - Alliance for Green Socialism GWLD - Gwlad Gwlad JACP - Justice & Anti-Corruption Party [The] SEQ - Socialist Equality TIG - Independent Group for Change WEP - Women's Equality Party YPP - Young People's Party CHP - Christian Party CLGB - Communist League CMU - Communities United NE - North East Party PBP - People Before Profit POS - Proud of Oldham & Saddleworth PP - The Peace Party SFP - Scottish Family Party SPGB - Socialist Party of Great Britain VPP - Veterans and People's Party YESH - Yeshua SPK - Speaker ASH - Ashfield Independents BNP - British National Party BPI - Burnley & Padiham Independent Party BSJP - Birkenhead Social Justice Party CF - CumbriaFirst CMEP - Church of the Militant Elvis Party CMUK - Citizens Movement Party UK CP - The Common People CVP - The Cynon Valley Party HWDI - Heavy Woollen District Independents INET - Independent Network LNIN - Lincolnshire Independents LUTN - Best for Luton MK - Mebyon Kernow MTHR - Motherworld Party PATR - Patria PFP - Psychedelic Future Party RBD - Rebooting Democracy SHRP - Shropshire Party SLP - Socialist Labour Party SNAV - Space Navies Party TCRP - The Constitution and Reform Party TLW - Touch Love Worldwide UGP - The Universal Good Party WY - Wycombe Independents LA mayor says winds and drought created 'perfect storm', while officials hit out at looters Climate 'whiplash' linked to raging LA fires Watch: The moment five US presidents gather at Jimmy Carter's funeral The '9/11 mastermind' is set to plead guilty.
