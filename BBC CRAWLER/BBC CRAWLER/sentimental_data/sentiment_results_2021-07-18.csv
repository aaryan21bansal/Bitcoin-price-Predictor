"At Ocado's warehouses, hundreds of robots zip around a grid, collecting groceries and bringing them to members of staff who will pack them into boxes. Ocado has cancelled thousands of orders after a fire at a fulfilment centre in south-east London on Friday. The online grocer said the blaze started when three of the robots that help pick its groceries collided at the Erith site. About 800 staff had to be evacuated and firefighters worked through the night to contain the incident. It is the second fire involving robots at Ocado. Its Andover facility burned down in 2019 after an electrical fault. Shares in the company slipped by about 3% in early trade on Monday. Ocado handles up to 150,000 orders a week at the Erith warehouse. The company said the firewould cause ""disruption to operations"",externalbut that it was ""working to restore normal service as soon as possible"". ""We expect the facility to begin operating within the coming week and thank customers whose orders are affected for their patience. ""We would like to also thank the London Fire Brigade and all the other emergency services for their hard work and professionalism in dealing with this incident."" Ocado was the UK's third largest online grocer last year It said no one had been injured in the fire and all its staff were safe. The damage is limited to a small section of its warehouse, it added, although it could not say when the site would reopen. The retailer has contacted all affected customers, but there was a mixed reaction on social media. One angry customer tweeted: ""I'm sorry that there is a fire and glad that it appears no one is hurt, but why do I have to find out on twitter?"" Robots to take on more supermarket tasks 'Sprinklers turned off' in Ocado warehouse fire She added: ""This is the 3rd or 4th order in a row that has been messed up."" Others expressed support for the firm, with one tweeting: ""Whilst it may be inconvenient, some more compassion for the business and staff affected might be nice!"" Ocado's fulfilment centres are highly automated. At Erith, hundreds of robots zip around a grid, collecting groceries and bringing them to members of staff who will pack them into boxes, which are then loaded on to trucks for delivery. However, a fault in a battery charging unit caused a robot to catch light at Ocado's Andover distribution centre in 2019.

"Supermarkets have warned they will have to cut opening hours or even shut shops if the number of workers forced to self-isolate continues to rise. M&S said the number of workers being notified by the NHS app is rising exponentially, and it may have to reduce hours if there are shortages. A leading supermarket, which declined to be named, said it could lead to massive disruption of food supplies. ""And there's a risk that there won't be sufficient staff to open shops."" Last week, over 500,000 alerts were sent to users of the NHS Test and Trace app in England and Wales for the week to 7 July, a rise of 46% on the previous week. Covid: Who has to self-isolate and what if I'm fully vaccinated? How many coronavirus cases are there in my area? M&S chief executive Steve Rowetold The Times,externalthat the number of people being forced to self-isolate is ""a major issue across every industry at the moment"". He said: ""Our Covid cases are roughly doubling every week and the pinging level is about three to one of Covid cases, so we're seeing that growing exponentially."" He said: ""If there's shortages we'll have to manage it by changing hours of stores, reducing hours."" From 16 August, people who have been fully vaccinated will not have to self-isolate if they are ""pinged"" by the NHS app when they have come into contact with someone who has tested positive for Covid.  They will instead be advised to take PCR test as soon as possible. Morrisons says, along with the rest of the country, they are seeing a rise in self-isolations But another UK supermarket warned: ""The clock is ticking and the government needs to act fast to get people back to work if they have a negative test. ""If not, we could be heading towards crisis point next month."" A spokeswoman for Morrisons said: ""As per the whole of the UK, we are experiencing a rise in cases and close contact notifications."" But she added: ""We provide guidance and support for colleagues who may need to self-isolate including sick pay and have Covid secure controls in place in all our stores to ensure we can continue to operate and keep them open. Throughout the whole of the pandemic, we have not been required to close a store."" The British Retail Consortium (BRC), which represents the industry, said that the government must bring forward the changes on self-isolation from 16 August ""so that people who are fully vaccinated or have a negative test are not forced to needlessly quarantine"" when they are contacted by the app. BRC chief executive, Helen Dickinson, said: ""We are already seeing a serious impact on retail operations as a result of staff having to self-isolate and this will only get worse right across the economy, as cases are already rising fast and the final restrictions are eased."" Lord Karan Bilimoria, president of the Confederation of British Industry, said that amid ""crippling staff shortages, speed is of the essence"". He called for an immediate end to ""the self-isolation period of 10 days for people who are double-jabbed"" and ""a route out of isolation for those not yet fully vaccinated through daily lateral flow tests"". It comes as both the prime minister and the chancelloru-turned on a decision not to self-isolateafter coming into contact with health Secretary Sajid Javid, who announced on Saturday that he had tested positive for Covid. Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak initially said they planned to keep working on essential government business under a pilot scheme that involves daily testing. However, it prompted a backlash by opposition parties as well as the managing director of the retailer Iceland, Richard Walker, who tweeted: ""Shame the hundreds of Iceland staff who've been pinged can't avoid self-isolation. We can all do a daily lateral flow test."" The rising number of people being forced to self-isolate is impacting other sectors. Car-makers Nissan and Rolls-Royce have both warned that staff shortages could impact production at their plants. Around 10% of workers at Nissan's Sunderland plant are self-isolating Around 900 workers at Nissan's Sunderland plant have been sent home after being told to self-isolate. Rolls-Royce said it may have to halve production if more employees are contacted by the Test and Trace app. Mr Rowe also said: ""Where the industry will see the pain is in the supply chain, because logistics runs tight anyway to be efficient."" The union Community, which represents steelworkers across the UK as well as people working in logistics, said rising cases of coronavirus coupled with staff members having to self-isolate, has led to a lack of drivers being able to work. ""This is causing disruption in the industry, and reinforces the evidence government has been reckless in its approach to easing restrictions and should reconsider its approach,"" a spokesman for Community said. On Monday, final Covid restrictions will be lifted in England, including the legal requirement to wear a face mask in enclosed spaces. On Friday, the number of daily coronavirus cases reported in the UK surpassed 50,000 for the first time since mid-January. It recorded 54,674 cases on Saturday.

"Oil producing nations have agreed to increase their output, with the aim of reducing prices and easing pressure on the world economy. The Opec cartel and partners such as Russia will boost supply from August after prices climbed to two-and-half-year highs during the pandemic. The move should have an impact on petrol prices at the pump, which have also rocketed. The price of Brent crude oil is up 43% this year to almost $74 a barrel. Last year, Opec and its partners cut production by a record 10 million barrels per day (bpd) amid a pandemic-induced slump in demand and collapsing prices. However, this year the price of oil has surged as economies have reopened, contributing to rising inflation in some countries and threatening to put the brakes on the global recovery. The growing rivalry that's pushing up oil prices Oil prices climb back to pre-pandemic levels Oil producers have been seeking to ease the cuts, but a row between Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates threatened to derail the plans earlier in July. Abu Dhabi had blocked a proposal by Riyadh and Moscow to extend output curbs to 2022 after they rejected its demand to produce more oil. The unusually public dispute between the close allies had raised fears about the stability of the ""Opec +"" cartel, which controls more than 50% of the world's oil supplies. Under the new deal, Opec and partners have agreed to increase supply by a further two million barrels per day from August until December 2021 to help stabilise the market. Higher output quotas have also been agreed for several members from May 2022, including the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Russia, Kuwait and Iraq. The cartel said it would phase out by September 2022 oil production cuts that were brought in last year. Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak told public television channel Rossia 24 that the members had been ""constructive"" and found ""consensus"". ""The pandemic is not yet overcome, but we are seeing that thanks to vaccination all over the world, demand for our production is recovering as is the use of cars and air planes,"" he said. ""It is therefore very important for us to fulfil our responsibilities and allow a recovery of the world economy.""

"Britney is in a legal battle to end the conservatorship, set up in 2008 Britney Spears has said she will not perform again while her father retains control over her career as part of a conservatorship set up in 2008. The singer's message is the latest in a series of emotional public comments about the arrangement that controls her personal and financial affairs. ""This conservatorship killed my dreams,"" she said in a lengthy post on Instagram. ""So all I have is hope."" Spears, 39, wants to bring an end to the arrangement, calling it abusive. The conservatorship was put in place after her father, Jamie Spears, petitioned a court for legal authority over the pop star's life, amid concerns about her mental health. ""I'm not gonna be performing on any stages anytime soon with my dad handling what I wear, say, do, or think,""Spears, who has not performed in public since late 2018, wrote in the post.,external ""I'd much rather share videos YES from my living room instead of onstage in Vegas... I'm not gonna put on heavy makeup and try try try on stage again and not be able to do the real deal with remixes of my songs for years."" In the message, the singer also said she ""did not like the way"" documentaries about her life bring up ""humiliating moments from the past"", adding: ""I'm way past all that and have been for a long time."" The documentaries - including Framing Britney Spears, which has been nominated for two Emmy awards - together with the #FreeBritney movement brought wider attention to the conservatorship, and public support for the singer. This video can not be played What we can all learn from Britney Spearsâ case In explosive court testimony last month, Spears said she had been drugged, forced to perform against her will and prevented from having more children under the conservatorship. On Wednesday, she appointed a new lawyer to represent her in the legal bid to bring the arrangement to an end. They are yet to file a formal request, and the next court hearing will be on 29 September in Los Angeles. Spears also said she wanted to charge her father for his alleged ""conservatorship abuse"", which can involve financially exploiting or imposing excessive personal restrictions on someone in your care. He is currently the sole person in charge of his daughter's $60m (Â£43m) estate. His lawyers say he has not been in charge of her personal affairs since September 2019 because of his own poor health.

"Nearly all remaining Covid restrictions are coming to an end. But with infection rates and hospital admissions already rising sharply, it is a significant gamble. One expert likens what is being done to taking the ""control rods out of a nuclear reactor"". ""This is going to make things worse than they are now and we don't know when it will peak,"" says Loughborough University data analyst Dr Duncan Robertson. And that in many ways goes to the heart of the issue. This is our first ""natural wave"" of Covid - all the others have been brought to an end through lockdown and restrictions. The plan is for this one to exhaust itself. So predicting what will happen is much more difficult. The move has been given the personal backing of chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty and a number of the scientists advising him. Infection rates were always going to rise at this stage of the roadmap - more mixing means it is easier for the virus to spread. But with significant levels of immunity from vaccination and natural infection the hope is spread of the virus will be brought under control in the coming weeks. How many people in the UK have been vaccinated so far? Covid vaccines: How fast is worldwide progress? Some have suggested the government should wait longer before taking this step. But infections are already rising so that will not halt the rise. And, according to Prof Whitty, were we to wait any longer, there is a risk the peak of infections this summer wave could be pushed to the autumn, which could make things worse with flu and other viruses circulating. But that does not mean government scientists do not have concerns. Behind the scenes, they have been questioning the policy on face masks, in particular, after ministers made big play of the fact mask-wearing would no longer be legally required. Not because it will dramatically alter the course of rising infections, but because of the message it sent out - that controlling infection no longer mattered. This has led to a definite change of approach with ministers now stressing the need to keep wearing masks in crowded indoor places. How are the rules on masks changing on 19 July? The reason is clear from the results of the latest modelling to be released. It looked at the impact of people returning almost immediately to normal behaviour, and compared it with a gradual resumption over months. The results estimated the gradual approach could halve the summer peak and avoid what is called an overshoot - whereby the surge in cases means greater numbers become infected than need be, before this summer wave peaks. The modelling shows this is much more important in reducing the peak than simply delaying the lifting of restrictions. It is why Prof Whitty has also referred to the importance of the public ""going slowly"" in the way they embrace new freedoms. Prof Matt Keeling, a modeller at the University of Warwick, has gone even further. ""If there is one message - the public is going to control the trajectory we are on,"" he said. But this is just one of many unknowns, which explains the huge range around the central estimate that hospital admissions will peak this summer at 1,000 to 2,000 a day. (The winter wave just gone hit 4,000 in comparison.) And if this does happen, it will come at a significant cost. While the vaccination programme has reduced the number of Covid deaths 10-fold, there could still be 100 to 200 deaths a day. About half of those are expected to be in unvaccinated people. It will also cause major disruption to the NHS. To put those summer figures into context, hospitals would expect to see about 1,000 admissions a day in the depths of winter, for all types of respiratory infections. Will 19 July unlocking gamble pay off or backfire? ""We would get through it as we have before,"" says Dr Alison Pittard, of the Faculty of Intensive Care Medicine. ""But it would be at the expense of elective care and other treatments."" Another consequence will be more people struggling with long Covid either because it takes them time to recover after being hospitalised or from persistent symptoms, such as fatigue and brain fog, which for a small minority appear to happen after milder illness. But, in the end, unless restrictions are re-introduced, this wave is only likely to come to an end when the wall of immunity - from vaccination and natural infection - is high enough. And when that happens, England could find itself in the very strong position, Sir Patrick Vallance, the government's chief scientific adviser, hinted  last week. He said we were reaching the level of immunity where ""big waves"" may be in the past. This does not mean herd immunity - given how infectious the Delta variant is and the changing nature of the virus, many experts now question whether this will be possible. Covid, they believe, is going to be around forever. Instead, scientists expect some sort of equilibrium will be reached, whereby the R number, the average number of people an infected person passes the virus on to, will fluctuate around one. This will see more manageable waves ebb and flow. And with vaccines offering good protection against serious illness, society will be more willing to tolerate the burden. After all, in the most recent bad winter - 2017-18 -there were 300 to 400 flu deaths a day at the peak,external, more than is being predicted for this summer's Covid peak. Will we get there in the coming months? It is, one of the key government modellers told me, really too close to call.

"The prime minister and chancellor are now self-isolating after contact with Health Secretary Sajid Javid, who has tested positive for coronavirus. No 10 initially saidthey would not have to isolate, as they were taking part in a pilot scheme that involves daily testinginstead. But opposition parties said it suggested there was ""one rule for them and another for the rest of us"". The PM later said they had ""briefly"" considered taking part in the scheme. It comes ahead of the lifting of lockdown rules in England from Monday. Almost all legal restrictions are to end, including limits on how many people can meet, and nightclubs will reopen, but self-isolation rules will remain. Following news that Mr Javid had tested positive and been in contact with Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak, No 10 said a workplace pilot scheme would allow them to keep working from Downing Street. But the announcement met with an angry response, with Labour's Jonathan Ashworth saying it was unfair politicians appeared to have access to ""VIP testing"" to avoid self-isolation, while Liberal Democrat Leader Ed Davey asked if it was only available to the ""privileged few"". How are Covid rules changing on Monday? Profile: Sajid Javid UK faces a difficult summer, says Covid scientist Speaking in avideo on Twitter,externalafter the U-turn, Mr Johnson said: ""We did look briefly at the idea of us taking part in the pilot scheme, which allows people to test daily, but I think it's far more important that everybody sticks to the same rules and that's why I'm going to be self-isolating until Monday 26 July. ""I know how frustrating it all is, but I really do urge everybody to stick with the programme and take the appropriate course of action when you're asked to do so by NHS Test and Trace."" The prime minister also defended the lifting of restrictions - amid ongoing rises in cases, deaths and hospitalisations - but urged people to be cautious. He said: ""We've got to remember that this virus is sadly still out there. Cases are rising. We can see the extreme contagiousness of the Delta variant, but we have this immense consolation and satisfaction that there is no doubt at all that the vaccine programme has very severely weakened the link between infection and hospitalisation and between infection and serious illness and death."" Mr Johnson will now conduct meetings remotely from Chequers, the prime minister's countryside retreat, where he was when the health secretary received his positive test result. Mr Sunaksaid on Twitter,external: ""Whilst the test and trace pilot is fairly restrictive, allowing only essential government business, I recognise that even the sense that the rules aren't the same for everyone is wrong."" This video can not be played The BBC asked people in York for their views on the U-turn Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has written to the prime minister, demanding he answer how he and the chancellor were included in the workplace programme. Among 10 questions, he also asked when the PM travelled to his country residence of Chequers from Downing Street, how many other ministers were covered by the workplace pilot and for a figure on how many members of the public have now deleted the NHS app. Sir Keir wrote: ""Today's latest fiasco of yourself and the chancellor being magically selected for a testing trial so you could avoid isolation like the rest of us is just the latest example of the Conservatives fixing the rules to benefit themselves, and only backtracking when they were found out."" The managing director of the Iceland supermarket chain, Richard Walker, also criticised the proposal for Mr Johnson and Mr Sunak to avoid self-isolation. ""Shame the hundreds of Iceland staff who've been pinged can't avoid self-isolation. We can all do a daily lateral flow test,"" he said. Mr Javid tested positive on Saturday morning after a meeting at Downing Street the day before, and both Mr Johnson and Mr Sunak were contacted by NHS Test and Trace. Speaking to the BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Vaccines Minister Nadhim Zahawi denied the government had taken the public for ""fools"", following Mr Johnson's u-turn on self-isolating. He said the prime minister had ""talked about considering"" taking part in the pilot scheme ""then very quickly realised the right thing to do self-isolate because it sends a very powerful message to everyone."" This must be one of the fastest government U-turns ever: 157 minutes after saying the PM and chancellor wouldn't be isolating, Downing Street decided they would. The reason is set out by Rishi Sunak on Twitter - ministers can't be seen to be following different rules to everyone else. But questions will be asked about why No 10 initially said they would be escaping isolation. Who made the decision? Who signed it off? The prime minister and chancellor must have known about the plan. There's also the fact that the PM and chancellor had the choice over whether to isolate - which most people don't at the moment. The political symbolism is also highly significant. Three senior government ministers will be in isolation on the day almost all legal restrictions are lifted in England. The government said there were 20 public and private sector organisations involved in the pilot scheme, including Network Rail, Transport for London (TfL), Heathrow Airport and Border Force. Heathrow said the programme had been an ""important tool"" that allowed it to keep the airport open, and was now calling on ministers to extend it beyond the end of July, when it is due to end. But TfL said it was ""still waiting for formal notification that we are part of this trial"". One London Underground line wasforced to close on Saturday because too many staff had to self-isolate. Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick had defended the programme on the Andrew Marr Show, describing it as ""well known"" and ""long standing"". Former Prime Minister Tony Blair added it would have been reasonable for Mr Johnson not to self-isolate, given he has been vaccinated twice, was previously infected, and is being tested regularly. He said: ""I don't want the prime minister of the country to be in isolation at the moment. I need him, you know, at his desk doing his job."" LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? LOCKDOWN RULES:What are they and when will they end? VACCINE:When will I get the jab? The UK recorded a further 48,161 cases and 25 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test on Sunday. On both Friday and Saturday daily cases exceeded 50,000 - the first time this level has been reached since mid-January. More thanhalf a million alerts telling people to self-isolatewere sent by the NHS Covid-19 app in England and Wales in the first week of July, with supermarkets saying they may have tocut opening hours or shut shops due to a lack of staff. Absences from school have also surged, with 840,000 pupils self-isolating in the first week of July. Mr Jenrick said self-isolation was ""an important part of keeping the virus under control"", adding thata study had showed the NHS Covid app had prevented 600,000 infections,externaland 8,000 deaths. However, he said the government was ending self-isolation in England for entire school bubbles on Monday and from 16 August fully vaccinated people will not have to self-isolate if a close contact tests positive. Mike Cherry, national chairman of The Federation of Small Businesses, said the government should now urgently review whether it should bring forward the changes to self-isolation. ""It could expand the pilot scheme that ministers currently enjoy to those at the front line of the economy,"" he said. Decision on vaccinating under-18s due shortly Long Covid funding to unearth new treatments Mr Javid is the latest in a series of government figures to test positive during the pandemic, including his predecessor Matt Hancock and Mr Johnson. The health secretary said on Twitter,externalthat he had felt ""a bit groggy"" on Friday and took a rapid lateral flow test the following morning, which was later confirmed with a PCR test. In addition to the meeting at Downing Street, Mr Javid had been working from his office at the Department of Health and Social Care in Whitehall last week and was in the Commons chamber three times. He is also known to have visited a care home in south London on Tuesday. Aashna House in Streatham has a 100% vaccination rate among staff and residents, however.

"Prime Minister Boris Johnson has urged caution as most legal restrictions on social contact are lifted in England. There are now no limits on how many people can meet or attend events; nightclubs reopened at midnight; and table service will not be necessary in pubs and restaurants. Face coverings will be recommended in some spaces, but not required by law. Vaccines Minister Nadhim Zahawi said government experts had recommended that only some under-18s be vaccinated. The prime minister is due to hold a news conference at 17:00 BST via video link as he, the chancellor and the health secretary are self-isolating - amid warnings that cases of Covid will surge. On BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Zahawi defended the U-turn which saw the prime minister and chancellor self-isolating, after initially saying they would take part in a pilot programme to take daily tests instead. Mr Zahawi insisted that Mr Johnson only ""considered"" joining the pilot scheme, adding: ""No one is taking anyone for fools."" How are Covid rules changing on Monday? Will 19 July unlocking gamble pay off or backfire? Nightclubs reopen at midnight to new challenges Limited recommendation for under-18 Covid jabs Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer accused the government of ""chaos, confusion and cronyism"", with the prime minister and chancellor undermining the self-isolation rules at a critical moment. He saida ""reckless free-for-all"" now risked plunging the country back into restrictions. ""The government has once again lost control of the virus. They need to think again on their reckless plan before it's too late,"" he said. Some scientists are predicting that UK infections - currently at about 50,000 a day - could reach 200,000 a day later in the summer. But with more than 68% of UK adults fully vaccinated, modelling suggests hospital admissions, serious illness and deaths from Covid-19 will be at a lower level than in earlier peaks. In avideo posted on Twitter on Sunday afternoon,,externalthe prime minister said now was the ""right moment"" to move to the final stage of England's roadmap out of lockdown. ""If we don't do it now we've got to ask ourselves, when will we ever do it?"" he said, adding that the virus would have the ""advantage of the cold weather"" in autumn and winter. ""But we've got to do it cautiously. We've got to remember that this virus is sadly still out there. Cases are rising, we can see the extreme contagiousness of the Delta variant."" This video can not be played Labour leader Keir Starmer: Johnson and Sunak changed isolation decision because they'd been ""busted"" Nadhim Zahawi said 90% of the most vulnerable had been vaccinated and it was right for people to take ""personal and corporate responsibility"" over measures such as wearing masks. ""We're doing the right thing to get as close to normal as possible, as quickly as possible,"" he told BBC Breakfast, saying that the end of the school term would reduce the spread of the virus. He also said he had received the recommendation from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation about vaccinating children aged 12 to 17 and would make a statement to Parliament on Monday afternoon. The committee has recommendedgiving the vaccine to children with conditions that make them vulnerable to Covid, children who live with someone vulnerable and those who are close to turning 18, he said. This video can not be played 'This is what life's about' - clubbers in England enjoy their first night out in 16 months As restrictions ease in England, businesses such as nightclubs - and large events - will be encouraged to use the NHS Covid Pass to check people are fully vaccinated, have natural immunity from infection or have a recent negative test. At Fibre in Leeds, owner Terry George said several customers were unvaccinated or had only had one jab so far. He added the government had not provided the tools to scan for vaccination status. While some clubgoers said they were a little nervous, most were overjoyed. ""It's been literally the best night of our lives. We've been waiting for this since we turned 18. This has been like life has come back to normal all of a sudden,"" said Mollie, 20. By Hannah Morrison, BBC Newsbeat at Fibre nightclub in Leeds The countdown began, midnight struck, confetti cannons went off and the queue erupted into cheers and screams of joy. Then the doors opened and hundreds of people poured into Fibre - a nightclub in the centre of Leeds. No proof of a negative test required, no Covid passports needed here, just the option of hand sanitiser on the door. It was straight onto the dance floor for most people; arms in the air singing along to the DJ's carefully selected first track - Ultra Nate's Free. No-one was wearing masks and it felt like everything was normal again. No-one wanted to talk about rising cases of coronavirus or the risks - they just wanted to dance. And for the first time in 16 months they could. UK-wideguidance recommending against travel to amber list countries is also being removed.Adults who have been fully vaccinated in the UK will not have to self-isolate for 10 days after visiting these countries - with the exception of those returning from France to England, Scotland or Wales, because of concerns over the spread of the Beta variant of the virus. As the legal requirement for masks ended, signs at Manchester Piccadilly station urged travellers to continue wearing them, but several people declined. England's nationwide mask requirement will end, although face coverings are still recommended Mark Dawson, on his way to Scunthorpe for work, said: ""I'll do what the government tells me to do but if they say I don't have to, I won't."" Transport for London said it was seeing 85% of passengers wearing masks across its network and there had been no surge in commuters returning to the office. by Harry Low at Farringdon station Confusion was the word on almost everybody's lips inthe first rush hour commute since rule changes were introduced. Around three quarters of people were wearing masks but although face coverings are mandatory on TfL services, they're not on Thameslink trains which serve the station. As passengers make the short journey across the platform, the advice changes meaning they can either remove or apply their face coverings depending on which direction they are travelling. Christopher McCready, who lives in Scotland but works in London, said he would continue wearing a mask despite having contracted the virus a month ago but, like many, he called for greater clarity. ""The whole island should be under the same rules,"" he said. According to a survey by the Office for National Statistics, almost two-thirds of adults across Great Britain intend to continue wearing masks in shops and on public transport, following England's lifting of legal restrictions. Scotland also eased restrictions on Monday - with pubs and restaurants able to open until midnight. However, limits on group meetings will remain, the return of workers to offices will be delayed, and face coverings will still be mandatory. Restrictions are set to be relaxed in Wales on 7 August and in Northern Ireland on 26 July. Meanwhile, the surge in infections - with 48,161 cases reported on Sunday and more than 50,000 on Saturday - has raised concerns about health impacts and the number of people self-isolating. Contact tracing and self-isolation requirements remain in place. Supermarket Iceland and pub company Greene King are the latest businesses toshut some of their sites because too many staff had received alerts to self-isolateby the NHS Covid app for England and Wales. Recent figures show that more than half a million alerts were sent out in the first week of July, whileabsences from schoolhave also surged. Some fully vaccinated frontline NHS staff in Englandwill be allowed to continue working if contacted by NHS Test and Trace, the government has said, amid concerns over employee shortages. LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? LOCKDOWN RULES:What are they and when will they end? VACCINE:When will I get the jab? An announcement by the health secretary on Saturday that he had tested positive for coronavirus sentMr Johnson and Chancellor Rishi Sunak into self-isolation. No 10 initially said they would not have to isolate as they were taking part in a pilot scheme that involves daily testing - sparking a backlash from opposition parties and businesses affected by staff quarantining. On Monday, Mr Zahawi said Downing Street and the Cabinet Office would no longer be part of the pilot scheme. But he said he was ""very much briefed"" that Transport for London, Network Rail and Heathrow had been part of the pilot, despite TfL saying they had been waiting to hear more about it from the government.

What are the symptoms of long Covid? Get NHS help with Covid recovery,external Routine Covid testing is not recommended, and most people can't get free tests via the NHS. You may stillbe able to get free NHS tests,externalif you: have a health condition that makes you eligible for treatment if you test positive work in healthcare or a hospice You can buy a test for about Â£2 from High Street and online chemists, but cannot report these test results to the NHS. People are largely advised to treat Covid like any other respiratory disease. You no longer have to self-isolate after testing positive. However, the government recommends trying to stay home for five days - or three for under-18s, as younger people tend to be infectious for a shorter period. People at higher risk of becoming seriously ill with Covid who have been told they areentitled to treatments if they catch it,externalmust report their test result so the NHS can contact them about their options. How to look after yourself if you get Covid Some people are infectious for about five days but others may be contagious for up to 10. Those who have a high temperature or still feel unwell after five days are advised to stay home if they can until they: feel well enough for your normal activities no longer have a high temperature You don't have to tell your employer you have Covid.

"The Piccadilly and District lines were also impacted A London Underground line has reopened after it was closed on Saturday because too many staff had received isolation alerts via the NHS Covid-19 app. No services ran on the Metropolitan line as staff had been contacted by NHS Test and Trace. The Piccadilly and District lines were also affected, but have also reopened. Transport unions have warned of ""dire consequences"" in the coming days as staff are contacted through the app. The Rail, Maritime and Transport union general secretary Mick Lynch previously said there would be ""a surge in workers pinged with a self-isolation instruction"" after England's Covid-19 restrictions are eased on Monday. The latest figures showed infection rates were rising in all areas of London in the seven days up to 12 July, with Hammersmith and Fulham recording the highest rate of 436 cases per 100,000 people. Transport for London said it was waiting for the government to confirm whether its staff would be part of a trial which allows those who have been pinged by the app to take daily tests rather than self isolate. Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Chancellor Rishi Sunak had initially said they were part of that trial when they were contacted by NHS Test and Trace after Health Secretary Sajid Javid tested positive for Covid-19. They have now announced they will self isolate. A TfL spokesperson said the current rules on self-isolation ""led to vital control room staff being unable to come to work, causing disruption on some Tube lines"". ""The government has indicated that we could be part of a trial whereby daily tests would replace the need for self-isolation,"" he added. ""We are still waiting for formal notification from them that we are part of this trial so that we can brief our trade unions and put this into effect."" London Mayor Sadiq Khan has saidface coverings must be worn on London's transport network after the national restrictions are eased.
