"Christmas ""bubbles"" of three households in Scotland should contain no more than eight people over the age of 11, the Scottish government has said. The rule is part of thegovernment's guidance for Christmas,externalwhich temporarily relaxes some Covid-19 restrictions for five days. Children under the age of 12 will not count towards the total number of people in the bubble. The easing of Covid rules will apply across the UK from 23 to 27 December. Opposition parties have accused the Scottish government of sending out ""mixed messages"" by allowing people to meet at Christmas while simultaneously urging them not to do so. And many health experts have warned that the move is likely to lead to a spike in cases of the virus - and potentially deaths - in January UK governmentguidance for people in England,externaldoes not set a limit on the number of people in a bubble, but says this should be kept ""as small as possible"". What are the rules for forming bubbles at Christmas? No separate guidance has been published for Wales or Northern Ireland at this stage, although people can travel to or from Northern Ireland on 22 and 28 December. The NI executive ismeeting on Thursdayto discuss the rules. A UK-wide deal was agreed on Tuesday to permit people to meet up in ""bubbles"" over the festive period. Travel restrictions will be lifted across all four nations from 23 to 27 December so people can visit close friends and relatives. But Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has that said the ""default advice"" and ""safest position"" was still that people should avoid contact. Single households should not travel in or out of level three or level four areas to stay in tourist accommodation The Scottish guidance states that the ""safest way to spend Christmas and the festive period is to stay within your own household, in your own home and your own local area"". It adds: ""Wherever possible you should keep in touch with friends and family members from other households through technology - or, if you decide to meet in person, you should minimise the numbers and duration, and if possible meet out of doors. ""Consider a Christmas walk with family, rather than a meal indoors."" This video can not be played How you and your family can celebrate Christmas and minimise the spread of coronavirus Although three households will be allowed to meet indoors and stay overnight in the same home, the Scottish government says a two-metre distance should be kept between people from different households. However, children under 12 will be exempt from the physical distancing rules. Other guidance for different households staying in the same home includes: Avoiding sharing cutlery or crockery Washing your hands frequently Cleaning ""touch points"" regularly, such as door handles and surface Doors and windows should also be opened to let in as much fresh air as possible during and after visits. Christmas bubbles in Scotland can only gather in a private home, outdoors or at a place of worship. They will not be allowed to visit pubs, restaurants or go to shops together and staying in tourist accommodation as a group is banned as well. Single households should also not travel in or out of level three or level four areas in Scotland to use tourist accommodation, the guidance says. Scottish Greens co-leader Patrick Harvie highlightedwarnings from public health expertsthat the easing of restrictions over Christmas was likely to lead to a third wave of infections, hospitals being overrun, more ""unnecessary"" deaths and potentially a nationwide lockdown in January. Speaking in the Holyrood chamber, Mr Harvie also questioned why the Scottish government had apparently not carried out any risk assessments on the potential impact of easing the restrictions. He added: ""I recognise that there were difficult judgements to make about relaxing the Covid rules over the holidays, especially after public expectations had been built up. ""But within a day of announcing the looser rules, the first minister is appealing to the public not to use them. It's a confusing message.""

"Tougher rules for England will ""strike a balance"" when the national lockdown ends next week, Boris Johnson has said. At a Downing Street briefing, the PM acknowledged that the stricter three-tiered system of regional measures to tackle coronavirus would bring ""heartbreak and frustration"". But he said ""your tier is not your destiny"" and stressed that ""every area has the means of escape"". Most of England will bein the toughest two levels of measuresfrom 2 December. The system will be reviewed every two weeks, with the first review scheduled for 16 December - so an area's tier level may change before Christmas. What are the new rules? Check the new tier for your area 'Don't hug elderly relatives at Christmas' Estonia and Latvia taken off travel corridor list However, it means 55 million people will remain banned from mixing with other households indoors after the lockdown ends. More than a third of England's population, including large parts of the Midlands, North East and North West, as well as Kent, will be in the highest level - tier three. And the majority of places are in the second highest level - tier two - including London, and Liverpool city region. The Isle of Wight, Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly - where there have been no recorded cases in the past week - will be the only areas of England in the lowest level of curbs - tier one. The new tier restrictions will be voted on by MPs next week, with arevolt already brewingamong the government's own backbenchers. Meanwhile, hospitality bosses have warnedthe sector will be ""decimated""by the new tiers. On Thursday, another 498 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were reported in the UK, and a further 17,555 positive cases,the latest figures showed.,external The prime minister warned that easing off risked ""losing control, casting aside our hard-won gains and forcing us back into a new year national lockdown"". He said there was ""no doubt the restrictions in all tiers are tough"" but admitted previous tiers ""were never quite enough"". The new approach was ""designed to reduce"" the R number - the average number of people an infected person will pass the disease on to - ""below one"", he added. Mr Johnson said mass community testing would be offered to tier three areas ""as quickly as possible"" and hailed Liverpool City region as a ""success story"", where mass testing had brought the area down to tier two. Move to tier 2 due to 'hard work and sacrifice' Mayor hopes 'to be out of tier 3 in two weeks' Anger as whole of Lancashire put into tier 3 'Huge relief' in Cornwall at tier 1 grading The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg asked the PM to clarify ""what was the point"" of the second national lockdown, if more people were facing tougher rules than before it began. Mr Johnson insisted this was ""not continuing the lockdown"". ""Across all tiers, shops will be open, hairdressers, personal services will be open, gyms will be functioning, places of worship will be open for communal worship as well, so this is a very different thing,"" he said. The PM added: ""And I'm convinced that by April things genuinely will be much, much better."" Some cold hard truths are emerging about the government's approach to controlling coronavirus. Much about today's announcement was familiar. A promise of hope on the horizon followed by a dose of reality about the spread of the virus and tough measures taken as a result. But months on from the arrival of Covid-19, the once solid political consensus over the response to the pandemic has worn thin. Now new measures are met with Conservative MPs up in arms and cutting criticism from the opposition. But wearily, reluctantly, the prime minister has clearly priced all that in and come to the view that tighter restrictions are needed for many more months before things can even begin to get back to something like normal. Meanwhile, the UK government's chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty and its chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance have warned against hugging and kissing elderly relatives this Christmas. Speaking at the news conference, Prof Whitty said people's behaviour at Christmas would ""matter a great deal"" this year. ""Would I encourage someone to hug and kiss elderly relatives? No, I would not,"" he said. ""It's not against the law. You can do it within the rules that are there, but it does not make sense because you could be carrying the virus."" Sir Patrick echoed his remarks, saying ""hugging elderly relatives is not something to go out and do"" over the festive season. Prof Whitty also said tier two would ""hold the line"" but not bring cases down - prompting scepticism from Conservative MP Mark Harper about the PM's claim that ""your tier is not your destiny"". Mr Harper, whose Forest of Dean constituency is in tier two, tweeted: ""Unfortunately, just after the PM said this, Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer, said tier two would only hold infections level, and tier one would see them go up. ""That rather suggests if you're in tier two, it is your destiny - at least until the spring."" MASS TESTING:Where is it available? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? SCHOOLS:What will happen if children catch coronavirus? TESTING:How do I get a virus test? Differences between the new tiers include restrictions on where households can meet up: tier one: the rule of six applies everywhere, indoors and out tier two: the rule of six applies outdoors but there is no household mixing anywhere indoors tier three: can only meet other households in outdoor public spaces like parks, where the rule of six applies Gyms and close-contact beauty services like hairdressers will be able to open in all tiers. People in all tiers who can work from home, should continue to do so. Pubs in tier two can only open to serve ""substantial meals"", while those in tier three can only operate as a takeaway or delivery service. Decisions on tiers are based on public health recommendations informed by a series of public health data, including Covid-19 cases among the over-60s, positivity rates, pressure on the NHS and how quickly cases are rising or falling. BBC analysis shows a north-south divide in England when it comes to restrictions: 75% of people in the the North (the North East, North West, Yorkshire and Humber) are in tier three, with 25% in tier two 73% of the Midlands (the East Midlands and West Midlands) are in tier three, 27% in tier three 10% of the south (the South West, South East, East and London) are in tier three, with 87% in tier two and 2.5% in tier one Devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have the power to set their own coronavirus regulations, though all four UK nations have agreeda joint plan for Christmas. Earlier, data from the Office for National Statistics showed coronavirus infection rates in Englandwere continuing to show signs of levelling off.

"The Scottish government has updated itsguidance on forming household bubbles over the festive period,external. It was originally envisaged that up to three households could form a ""Christmas bubble"" between 23 and 27 December - but with a new strain of Covid spreading more rapidly, that relaxation has been dramatically scaled back. The current Covid rules will now be relaxed for Christmas Day only, not the five day window that was previously announced. By law a maximum of eight people from three households can meet up - although fewer numbers are recommended. The Scottish government advises spending the festive period at home with members of your own household. Children under the age of 12 do not count towards the total, and do not need to physically distance from others. Everyone else is encouraged to keep 2m (6ft 6in) away from those outside their own household as much as possible to lower the risk of transmitting the virus. You can only be in one Christmas bubble, and cannot change to a different one. The government says anyone thinking of creating a bubble should carefully consider the risks. It stresses that people do not have to meet other people or feel pressured to spend Christmas with another household. The advice is to keep in touch using technology wherever you can, and to gather outside if possible. For example, go for a walk rather than having a meal together. Those in extended households can form a bubble, but it can only contain one extended household. Where parents do not live in the same household, children can still move between their homes if they are in different bubbles. Those in a bubble can only gather in a private home, outdoors or at a place of worship - but should minimise the length of time spent with the bubble, especially indoors. If you are meeting in someone's home it is recommended that you: open a door or window to let in as much fresh air as you can, both during and after a visit keep 2m away from people not in your usual household wash your hands frequently regularly clean touch points, such as door handles and surfaces avoid sharing cutlery or crockery if possible People should not mix with other households elsewhere. If you are going to a pub, restaurant or a leisure or entertainment venue, you must do this with your own household. The opening hours for hospitality venues will follow the rules which apply in that area at the time. The government says people in a bubble should not stay in tourist accommodation together as a group. Travel within Scotland will be allowed on Christmas Day, but the advice is to stay as local as possible. You must travel and return home on 25 December, and can only travel to meet those within your Christmas bubble. It is illegal to travel to and from other parts of the UK over the festive period unless you qualify for one of the specific exemptions. From Boxing Day all of mainland Scotland will be in level four and some islands in level three - meaning people should not leave their local authority area except for essential reasons. The Scottish government is strongly advising people not to travel overseas. From Boxing Day, non-essential travel in and out of Scotland will be prohibited. Under the plans students will be tested twice five days apart Students who return home at the end of term will be part of the household they have returned to. Plans are already in place toallow students return home over Christmasif they return two negative Covid-19 tests. People other than students who live in a shared flat or house are considered a household. The government is urging them not to split up and enter separate bubbles over the festive period. If people are joining different bubbles, they should isolate from their flatmates for about a week both before and after joining the bubble. The government says anyone who has previously been advised to shield because they are at highest clinical risk from Covid-19 should ""take time to think"" about forming a bubble because it would bring greater risks. It says people should not feel pressured to enter an environment which makes them anxious. People can still go into another household to provide care and support for a vulnerable person. However, if you visit someone in a hospital, hospice or care home the government says the safest way to spend Christmas would be not to form a bubble with another household. That is because doing so would increase the risk of being exposed to Covid-19 and passing it on to other people, and those in care homes, hospitals and hospices can be particularly vulnerable. If someone in a bubble develops Covid-19 symptoms, everyone within the bubble must isolate immediately if they met that person any time between two days before and 10 days after their symptoms started. If that person tests positive, all members of the bubble must self-isolate for 10 days from the start of symptoms or their most recent contact. In England, plans to allow people to meet up for Christmas have been scrapped for London and the south east which have moved into a new tier four level of restrictions. Elsewhere in England - across tiers one to three - the plan to allow ""Christmas bubbles"" from 23 to 27 December is being changed to Christmas Day only. A new national lockdown in Wales began on Sunday 20 December. Bubbles of more than two households can meet on Christmas Day only. In Northern Ireland a new six-week lockdown begins on Boxing Day. People will only be able to form a Christmas bubble on one day between 23 and 27 December, so there is flexibility for those working on Christmas Day.

"Scotland's first minister has said she ""agonised"" over whether to allow people to meet up at Christmas and would rather they chose not to. A UK-wide deal was agreed on Tuesday to permit people to meet up in ""bubbles"" for five days over the festive period. But Nicola Sturgeon said the ""default advice"" and ""safest position"" was still that people should avoid contact. She said she would not be meeting her parents, saying she did not want to put them at risk ""for the sake of one day"". Groups of up to three households will be allowed to form expanded bubbles from 23 to 27 December, but Ms Sturgeon said this was the ""outer limit"", adding that ""the virus will not have gone away by Christmas"". Caution urged over coronavirus Christmas rules What are the Covid rules at Christmas? How to avoid catching Covid this Christmas The UK-wide plans were announced on Tuesday to lift travel restrictions across the four nations and allow people to visit close friends and relatives. However, at her coronavirus briefing on Wednesday, Ms Sturgeon urged people to only use the extra flexibility if they really needed to - and suggested the rules were changed because ministers knew people would break them. She said: ""We agonise over all these decisions, and are trying to come to the outcome that balances best all these competing factors and desires people have. ""On this occasion we are trying to reflect the reality that for some people, sticking rigidly to the current rules over Christmas - if that means leaving loved ones on their own - is something people might not be prepared to do. ""Rather than leave everyone to navigate that themselves and decide their own boundaries, we decided to try and set some outer limits and boundaries to ask people to work within. ""That decision does not mean we are positively encouraging people to get together - I want to stress that just because we are allowing people to create a bubble doesn't mean you have to do it."" Ms Sturgeon said she ""agonised"" over the decision Ms Sturgeon added: ""I will continue to ask you to err on the side of caution. If you have been making painful sacrifices for eight months to keep your loved ones safe, then think about whether you want to take a risk with their safety at the eleventh hour in this journey."" The first minister said she was ""desperate"" to see her own mum and dad, but said ""I don't want to put my parents at risk for the sake of one day"". Some advisors have suggested allowing greater socialising over the festive period will cause a spike of new cases in January, with one government science advisor, Prof Andrew Hayward, telling the BBC that it would be like ""throwing fuel on the Covid fire"". And Scottish government advisor Devi Sridhar told Channel Four News that ""we are going to pay for Christmas holidays with probably a January national lockdown"". Opposition parties have pressed for the publication of any government risk assessments or modelling of the number of new infections or deaths which may result from increased mixing. The Scottish Greens said ""the last thing we need is to be sending out mixed signals"", with MSP Alison Johnstone saying ""parliament and the people of Scotland deserve to know how many extra infections the Scottish government is comfortable with"". However Ms Sturgeon and her National Clinical Director Prof Jason Leitch suggested this modelling does not exist. Prof Leitch said there was not ""very specific modelling"" charting the number of potential cases, simply noting that ""if we mix households we will get more infections"". And the first minister said there was no ""some magic model or piece of analysis"" which would answer hard questions for the government. She said she would ""really rather"" people not travel and meet up if they can avoid it, saying that ""if there was a big scary model I could put in front of you I wouldn't be deliberately hiding it"".

The new tier restrictions will be voted on by MPs next week, with arevolt already brewingamong the government's own backbenchers. Meanwhile, hospitality bosses have warnedthe sector will be ""decimated""by the new tiers. On Thursday, another 498 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were reported in the UK, and a further 17,555 positive cases,the latest figures showed.,external The prime minister warned that easing off risked ""losing control, casting aside our hard-won gains and forcing us back into a new year national lockdown"". He said there was ""no doubt the restrictions in all tiers are tough"" but admitted previous tiers ""were never quite enough"". The new approach was ""designed to reduce"" the R number - the average number of people an infected person will pass the disease on to - ""below one"", he added. Mr Johnson said mass community testing would be offered to tier three areas ""as quickly as possible"" and hailed Liverpool City region as a ""success story"", where mass testing had brought the area down to tier two. Move to tier 2 due to 'hard work and sacrifice' Mayor hopes 'to be out of tier 3 in two weeks' Anger as whole of Lancashire put into tier 3 'Huge relief' in Cornwall at tier 1 grading The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg asked the PM to clarify ""what was the point"" of the second national lockdown, if more people were facing tougher rules than before it began. Mr Johnson insisted this was ""not continuing the lockdown"". ""Across all tiers, shops will be open, hairdressers, personal services will be open, gyms will be functioning, places of worship will be open for communal worship as well, so this is a very different thing,"" he said. The PM added: ""And I'm convinced that by April things genuinely will be much, much better."" Some cold hard truths are emerging about the government's approach to controlling coronavirus. Much about today's announcement was familiar. A promise of hope on the horizon followed by a dose of reality about the spread of the virus and tough measures taken as a result. But months on from the arrival of Covid-19, the once solid political consensus over the response to the pandemic has worn thin. Now new measures are met with Conservative MPs up in arms and cutting criticism from the opposition. But wearily, reluctantly, the prime minister has clearly priced all that in and come to the view that tighter restrictions are needed for many more months before things can even begin to get back to something like normal. Meanwhile, the UK government's chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty and its chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance have warned against hugging and kissing elderly relatives this Christmas. Speaking at the news conference, Prof Whitty said people's behaviour at Christmas would ""matter a great deal"" this year. ""Would I encourage someone to hug and kiss elderly relatives? No, I would not,"" he said. ""It's not against the law. You can do it within the rules that are there, but it does not make sense because you could be carrying the virus."" Sir Patrick echoed his remarks, saying ""hugging elderly relatives is not something to go out and do"" over the festive season. Prof Whitty also said tier two would ""hold the line"" but not bring cases down - prompting scepticism from Conservative MP Mark Harper about the PM's claim that ""your tier is not your destiny"". Mr Harper, whose Forest of Dean constituency is in tier two, tweeted: ""Unfortunately, just after the PM said this, Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer, said tier two would only hold infections level, and tier one would see them go up. ""That rather suggests if you're in tier two, it is your destiny - at least until the spring."" MASS TESTING:Where is it available? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? SCHOOLS:What will happen if children catch coronavirus? TESTING:How do I get a virus test? Differences between the new tiers include restrictions on where households can meet up: tier one: the rule of six applies everywhere, indoors and out tier two: the rule of six applies outdoors but there is no household mixing anywhere indoors tier three: can only meet other households in outdoor public spaces like parks, where the rule of six applies Gyms and close-contact beauty services like hairdressers will be able to open in all tiers. People in all tiers who can work from home, should continue to do so. Pubs in tier two can only open to serve ""substantial meals"", while those in tier three can only operate as a takeaway or delivery service. Decisions on tiers are based on public health recommendations informed by a series of public health data, including Covid-19 cases among the over-60s, positivity rates, pressure on the NHS and how quickly cases are rising or falling. BBC analysis shows a north-south divide in England when it comes to restrictions: 75% of people in the the North (the North East, North West, Yorkshire and Humber) are in tier three, with 25% in tier two 73% of the Midlands (the East Midlands and West Midlands) are in tier three, 27% in tier three 10% of the south (the South West, South East, East and London) are in tier three, with 87% in tier two and 2.5% in tier one Devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have the power to set their own coronavirus regulations, though all four UK nations have agreeda joint plan for Christmas. Earlier, data from the Office for National Statistics showed coronavirus infection rates in Englandwere continuing to show signs of levelling off.

"Police in Cardiff will be able to carry out random vehicle checks on Black Friday and over the weekend Police have been granted extra powers, including carrying out random vehicle checks, to ensure people are not breaking Covid-19 rules in Cardiff. South Wales Police said it would increase the numbers of officers on duty to encourage people to adhere to the rules. The powers will be in place from 09:00 on Friday until 17:00 on Sunday. People breaching regulations could be fined and told to leave the city, the force said. Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales Christmas rules 'not an instruction to meet up' Q&A: What can you do as Wales' firebreak ends? Wales' ""firebreak"" lockdown ended on 9 November, allowing pubs, restaurants and non-essential retailers to reopen, with social-distancing measures in place. People living in Wales could also travel anywhere in the country from this date, but travel to and from England, which is still in lockdown until Wednesday, is banned. Supt Jason Rees said: ""The past few months have been difficult for us all, and with the rules having relaxed slightly, non-essential business reopening and Christmas just around the corner, it's understandable that people will want to get out and about and enjoy all our city has to offer. ""The vast majority are doing so with caution and within the confines of the existing regulations, but those not adhering to the rules are continuing to put others at increased risk. ""We are anticipating another busy weekend in our city centre, and while we will continue to adopt the policing style we have throughout the pandemic - working with the public to encourage voluntary compliance - we are committed to enforcing where blatant and flagrant breaches occur."" North Wales Police said it had no special operation in place for the coming weekend but had an ""ongoing  dedicated operation, which targets unlawful travel movement amongst other types of Welsh Government regulation breaches such as unlawful gatherings"". In the run up to Christmas many of us would be heading out for drinks and catch-ups with friends and preparing for parties. But under current coronavirus rules in Wales it is illegal to meet up with too many people, in a bid to curb the spread of the virus. Mass gatherings and house parties are banned, while only groups from four different households are allowed to meet indoors at pubs, cafes and restaurants. Pubs, bars and restaurants, gyms, and other businesses are also allowed to reopen, but with last orders at 22:00 GMT, there have been fears people may start going to each other's homes to drink. There are no travel restrictions in Wales, as local lockdowns have ended - but people are being urged to consider whether they need to travel before setting off. While England remains in lockdown - until 2 December - it is against the law to travel across the border, unless you have a reasonable excuse, such as providing care or for study or work (if you cannot from home). Under the coronavirus fixed penalty notices system, people can be fined Â£60 for a first offence, which increases to Â£120 for a second offence and continues to double for repeated offences, up to a maximum of Â£1,920. If prosecuted, however, a court can impose an unlimited fine. Q&A: Can I meet friends under new Covid rules?

"This video can not be played People in Cardiff share their views on the relaxation of Covid-19 rules over Christmas An agreement to relax Covid rules over Christmas is not ""an instruction to meet with other people"", Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford has said. Three households from around the UKwill be able to meet from 23 December until at least 27 December. It follows an agreement between the UK government and ministers in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Mr Drakeford said he believed people would be unwilling to stick to ""strict rules"" over the Christmas period. It comes as Welsh ministers consider whethermore restrictionswill be needed in the run up to Christmas, as cases rise among the under-25s. The first minister called for a ""common approach"" to dealing with the aftermath of Christmas - earlier he warned that relaxing rules would lead to an ""inevitable"" rise in coronavirus. Welsh Conservatives welcomed the agreement, but Plaid Cymru warned that ""hard-gotten gains"" must not be lost ""for the sake of a few days"". Mr Drakeford told BBC Wales: ""If we ask people just to stick to the strict rules we have now I'm afraid lots of people will not be prepared to do that. ""So it's not a choice between relaxation or no relaxation. ""It's having a form of relaxation where there are rules that people will recognise that will allow people to enjoy Christmas, but we'll do it in a controlled way."" The Welsh Labour leader added: ""People will be allowed to do what the law will allow them to do, but this is not an instruction to travel, it's not an instruction to meet with other people. ""People should still use a sense of responsibility, should still ask themselves whether what they are doing is keeping themselves and other people safe."" This video can not be played Mark Drakeford: ""We will have a modest period of relaxation"" Under the agreement, made at a meeting of Cobra on Tuesday afternoon: Travel restrictions will be eased to provide a window for households to come together Up to three households can form an exclusive ""bubble"" to meet at home during the period Bubble's must be fixed ""and must not be changed or extended further"" Each Christmas bubble can meet at home, at a place of worship or an outdoor public place The agreement said that ""existing, more restrictive"" rules on pubs and restaurants, and meeting in other venues will be maintained. Ministers have been considering tighter restrictions in Wales in the run up to the festive period. ""The cabinet will meet before the end of this week again,"" the first minister said. ""If we're in a position to make an announcement this week, then that's what we will do."" He added: ""Where does coronavirus spread? It's spread in people's homes, it spreads in hospitals and it spreads in hospitality. ""We have to think about all three of those settings and do our very best to bear down on the virus, which spreads so fast if it's given an opportunity."" Vaccines and mass testing are ""not going to come to our rescue in January"", the first minister added. ""There is still a pull through to the spring before we will see the real benefit of those things, and we are going to have to ask people to go on living with the virus, living with it sensibly, living with it in a way that limits the damage while we are bringing those new possibilities, fully on stream."" Three households will be able to ""bubble"" for the Christmas period Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said a ""compassionate but responsible approach"" was ""sensible"", but said the Welsh Government ""has a responsibility to ensure clear communication over the festive period, encouraging people to follow the guidelines"". Welsh Conservative Senedd leader Paul Davies welcomed the decision and said it showed ""what can be achieved when governments work together"". Simon Hart, the UK government's Welsh Secretary, said he was delighted with the agreement, but urged people ""to continue to be careful and responsible over the Christmas period to keep themselves and their families safe"". The broad questions about Christmas have been answered, but plenty of questions remain about what happens before and after. Mark Drakeford has said repeatedly that the festive relaxation will lead to more Covid cases and ""payback"" will be needed. Does that mean a tightening of the rules in the run up to Christmas? Probably. Could they be introduced to coincide with the new regime starting in England on 2 December? That would continue the theme of a communal UK approach. And while talk of vaccines and mass testing have given us hope for a better 2021, how quickly can they be rolled out to the general population? Whatever the calendar says, January could still feel very 2020.

"Families have been warned against hugging and kissing elderly relatives at Christmas ""if you want them to survive to be hugged again"". People ""just have to have sense"", said the UK government's chief medical adviser, Prof Chris Whitty. Coronavirus rules announced this week mean three households can form a bubble and mix for five days over Christmas. From 23 to 27 December, three households can mix indoors in homes, at a place of worship or outdoors. The rules apply to the whole of the UK,although in Scotlandthe number of people who can be in the Christmas bubble is limited to eight. And in Northern Ireland, the rules are relaxed from 22 to 28 December, to allow time to travel between the nations. What are the Christmas rules? PM Johnson on the new tough tier rules How to avoid catching Covid this Christmas Speaking at a Downing Street press conference on Thursday, Prof Whitty - who revealed he would be ""on the wards"" over Christmas - said: ""Would I want someone to see their family? Of course, that's what Christmas is about. ""But would I encourage someone to hug and kiss their elderly relatives? No, I would not. ""It's not against the law - and that's the whole point. You can do it within the rules that are there, but it does not make sense because you could be carrying the virus and if you've got an elderly relative, that would not be the thing you'd want to do in the period where we are running up to a point where we actually might be able to protect older people. ""So I think people just have to have sense. The fact that you can do something - this is true across so many other areas of life - doesn't mean you should."" Mr Whitty urged people not to do ""stupid things"" at Christmas Sir Patrick Vallance, the government's chief scientific adviser, added: ""It's not going to be a normal Christmas but if you want to make those connections with family, it has to be done in a way where you try and make sure that you don't increase the risk. ""I think hugging elderly relatives is not something to go out and do. It will increase the spread to a vulnerable population."" Prof Whitty added: ""If you want them to survive to be hugged again."" Prime Minister Boris Johnson also responded to the question about hugging elderly relatives, urging people to be ""common sensical"". ""Until the vaccine comes on stream, we are not out of the woods yet and we have to be very, very vigilant."" Prof Whitty also said it was ""not a secret"" that Christmas would increase the risk of transmission. ""Take it really seriously during Christmas. Don't do stupid things. Don't do unnecessary things just because the rules say you can. Think sensibly."" Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has that said the ""default advice"" and ""safest position"" was still that people should avoid contact. ""Just because we are allowing people to meet up in a limited way does not of course mean people have to do so, and people should not feel under pressure to do so,"" she said. This video can not be played How you and your family can celebrate Christmas and minimise the spread of coronavirus Thegovernment's official guidance,externalon Christmas bubbles advises people with loved-ones who are vulnerable advises to take personal responsibility to limit the spread of the virus. The NHS considers anyone 70 and over as ""clinically vulnerable"" and at moderate risk from coronavirus. The government guidance also has specific advice for people considered extremely vulnerable, as well as care home residents. It suggests forming a Christmas bubble is ""a personal choice"" for extremely vulnerable people, while those in care homes should only visit families if they are of working age. LOCKDOWN LOOK-UP:The rules in your area THREE TIERS:What are the new tiers? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters Under the government's rules, the three households must be fixed, so you will not be able to mix with two households on Christmas Day and two different ones on Boxing Day. Households in your Christmas bubble can't bubble with anyone else. Scotland has announced that the bubbles of three households should contain no more than eight people - but children under 12 are exempt. People who are self-isolating should not join a Christmas bubble. If someone tests positive, or develops coronavirus symptoms up to 48 hours after the Christmas bubble last met, everyone will have to self-isolate.

"This video can not be played Bar chain owner Martin Greenhow: ''This is pure and simple business torture"" The hospitality sector will be ""decimated"" by the new Covid tiers, according to bar chain owner Martin Greenhow, who says it ""isn't viable to operate"" under the conditions. Mr Greenhow, who has bars in cities including Manchester, says the measures are ""a mortal blow"" to the sector. The hospitality industry has warned that tens of thousands of businesses will close without extra support. It comes as more pub groups have been forced to make additional job cuts. Mitchells & Butlers, owner of the All Bar One and Harvester chains, revealed it had cut 1,300 jobs while Fuller Smith & Turner made 350 redundancies. The government has set outwhat level of restrictions England's regions will facewhen lockdown ends with cities such as Manchester, Birmingham and Newcastle put in the highest tiers. But chains such as Mr Greenhow's Mojo bars were struggling even before the second lockdown in England, imposed on 5 November. On the Friday before lockdown, Mr Greenhow's Manchester bar took Â£175. On the same Friday night a year before, it took Â£10,000. Almost all of England facing tough virus rules Pub sector warns it faces 'darkest of moments' New jobs in UK hospitality sector 'non-existent' Even tier one means that bars have less than half the usual number of customers, he says. ""It's simply not a business model that can work,"" he adds. ""Right now, for hospitality, all the tiers are a version of waterboarding. We're allowed out for a brief gasp of fiscal oxygen, then we're slammed back down."" ""This is pure and simple business torture."" UK Hospitality boss Kate Nicholls said the sector is ""bearing the brunt of the pain of closure"" under the new Covid rules. She added that tens of thousands of businesses will close without additional support. Under the new restrictions, pubs in tier 2 regions can only open if they serve substantial meals and households are not allowed to mix indoors. Under tier 3, pubs and restaurants must close their doors but can offer takeaways. Ms Nicholls said that 98% of its members were in areas with tier 2 or tier 3 coronavirus restrictions, and nearly nine in 10 ""say that they are not viable to operate at those level of restrictions"". ""Without additional support to sustain these businesses through this crisis, we are going to see tens of thousands of businesses closing and over a million job losses,"" she added. Birmingham City Council leader Ian Ward said hospitality and other businesses needed a ""meaningful package"" of support from the government so the economy can ""continue to function in an effective way"". ""The crisis faced by hospitality businesses across Birmingham is of particular concern from an economic perspective - a crisis that would have been exacerbated whether our city was placed in tier 2 or 3,"" said Mr Ward. ""Many businesses in this previously thriving sector are warning they may not survive the coming months if they are dealt the double blow of more restrictions and inadequate financial support."" The Night Time Industries Association (NTIA) described the imposition of the tier three level as ""devastating news"" for those areas. ""The government must compensate these businesses for the period of time they have been closed, and the loss of business suffered due to restrictions through the festive period,"" said NTIA chief executive Michael Kill.

"On Monday, the world heard how the UK's Covid vaccine - from AstraZeneca and Oxford University - was highly effective in advanced trials. It gave hope of another new jab to fight the pandemic that should be cheaper and easier to distribute than the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna mRNA vaccines that announced similarly impressive results just days before. But after the jubilation, some negative press has followed. On Thursday, multiple news outlets in the UK and US reported that there were questions over the data. They weren't about safety, but rather how effective the jab is. The questions centre around efficacy levels. Three were reported from the trial - an overall efficacy of 70%, a lower one of 62% and a high of 90%. That's because different doses of the vaccine were used in the trial. Some volunteers were given shots half the planned strength. Yet that ""wrong"" dose turned out to be a winner. Some of the shots were weaker than they were designed to be, containing much less of the ingredient that is meant to give a person immunity. The jab is actually two shots, with the second given a month after the first as a booster. While most of the volunteers in the trial got the correct dose for both of their two shots, some didn't. Regulators were told about it early on and they agreed that the trial could continue and more volunteers could be immunised. It had no effect on vaccine safety. Covid vaccines: Who decides if they are safe? How will I get a coronavirus vaccine? About 3,000 participants were given the half dose and then a full dose four weeks later, and this regime appeared to provide the most protection or efficacy in the trial - around 90%. In the larger group of nearly 9,000 volunteers, who were given two full doses also four weeks apart, efficacy was 62%. AstraZeneca reported these percentages and also said that its vaccine was, on average, 70% effective at preventing Covid-19 illness. The figures left some experts scratching their head. Prof David Salisbury, immunisation expert and associate fellow of the global health program at the Chatham House think tank, said: ""You've taken two studies for which different doses were used and come up with a composite that doesn't represent either of the doses. I think many people are having trouble with that.â³ AstraZeneca stressed that the data are preliminary, rather than full and final - which is true for the reportedPfizerandModernajab results too. It is science by press release. When they can, all of the companies will publish full results in medical journals for public scrutiny. And they are submitting full data to regulators to apply for emergency approval so that countries can start using these three different vaccines to immunise whole populations. LOCKDOWN LOOK-UP:The rules in your area THREE TIERS:How will the system work? TESTING:How do I get a virus test? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters LOCAL LOCKDOWNS:What happens if you have one? TEST AND TRACE:How does it work? The US regulator, called the FDA, have said any Covid vaccine needs to be at least 50% effective to be useful in fighting the pandemic. Even if you take the lowest figure of effectiveness for the AstraZeneca jab, it still passes that benchmark. The efficacy analysis was based on 131 cases of Covid-19 that occurred in the study participants: 101 of these cases happened in people who received dummy injections (either a saline jab or a meningitis vaccine). The other 30 were in people who received the real jab - three who got the half-strength initial dose and 27 who had the two full doses. The Oxford researchers are investigating why the weaker dose followed by a full one appeared to work better than two full ones. This video can not be played Laura Foster explains why the Oxford vaccine matters One idea is that a low then high dose shot may be a better mimic of a coronavirus infection and lead to a better immune response. But it is possible that the volunteers who got the half doses are somewhat different to those who got two big shots. Moncef Slaoui, the scientific head of the US's Operation Warp Speed - the programme to supply America with vaccines - told US reporters that the half-dose group only included people younger than 55. Since age is the biggest risk factor for getting seriously ill with Covid-19, a vaccine that protects the elderly is extremely important. However, results from an earlier phase two study of the Oxford vaccine,published in The Lancet medical journal, showed the vaccine produced a strong response in all age groups. An AstraZeneca spokesman said: ""As we communicated earlier this week, there is strong merit in continuing to further investigate the half-dose/ full dose regimen. ""We are further evaluating the data and will work with regulators on the best approach for further evaluation. This would add to data from existing trials which are currently being prepared for regulatory submission."" Although the dosing was different, the rest of the study didn't change from the original plan. Prof Peter Openshaw, an expert at Imperial College London, says the take home message should be that we have three very promising Covid vaccines that could soon become available to help save lives. ""We have to wait for the full data and to see how the regulators view the results. ""All we have to go on is a limited data release. The protection from the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine may be less than that from the mRNA vaccines, but we need to wait and see. ""It is remarkable that each of the trials that are now reporting shows protection, which we did not know was going to be possible."" He added: ""We have been wanting vaccines for many diseases for a long time and they haven't arrived - HIV, TB and malaria being good examples. ""The results so far seem to show that it can be done for Covid-19, and that's very good news indeed.""

"Amazon is spending hundreds of millions of dollars on bonuses for Christmas staff after sales at the online giant soared during the pandemic. Full-time warehouse workers in the UK and the US will receive Â£300 or $300, with Â£150 or $150 for part-time staff. The money, $500m in total, will go to staff working between 1-31 December. The firm, run by Jeff Bezos, the world's richest man, praised staff for ""serving customers' essential needs"" during the pandemic. In a blog post,external, Dave Clark, senior vice president of Amazon Worldwide Operations, wrote: ""I'm grateful to our teams who continue to play a vital role serving their communities. ""As we head into the peak of the holiday season, we want to share our appreciation through another special recognition bonus, totalling more than $500 million for our front-line employees."" Pandemic highlights anger at Amazon in France Retail workers 'scared' as cases surge For Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google business is booming The firm has come under intense scrutiny for working practices in its warehouses during the coronavirus pandemic. Labour activists in the US, for example, recently calledon big retailers like Amazon and Walmart to do more to protect workers as surging Covid-19 cases coincide with the holiday shopping rush. They are calling for hazard pay, paid sick leave and better communication about outbreaks. Amazon workers have raised concerns about their health and working conditions in Europe as well as in the US, claiming it is almost impossible to practice social distancing. Earlier this year, Amazon was forced to shut down several warehouses in Francein an ongoing row over conditions. The company has previously said that its guidelines are adequate and that it provides employees with face masks. However, the company said in a statement that  it ""provides some of the most advanced workplaces of their kind in the world, with industry-leading pay, processes and systems to ensure the wellbeing and safety of all employees"". Amazon said it had introduced additional cleaning and other safety measures to increase protection, and in the UK had started a pilot scheme offering voluntary Covid testing for employees. The retail giant has been one of the retail winners during coronavirus lockdowns as online deliveries skyrocketed when High Street shops closed. Sales will also be boosted during the Black Friday bonanza, although a coalition of trade unions, environmentalists and other activists have urged consumers to boycott the firm. Protests are being planned in several countries, and in Germany, the trade union Verdi has organised three-day strikes at Amazon warehouses, Sales at the internet giant shot to $96.1bn in the three months to 30 September - up 37% from the same period in 2019. And profits hit a record $6.3bn, nearly three times last year's total. But that level of growth has not come without additional costs. Amazon said it had $2.5bn in Covid-related expenses. In the UK it has also had to create thousands of jobs,as well as 20,000 seasonal posts, in a bid to keep up with shoppers. Pandemic highlights anger at Amazon in France.

"Michel Barnier at St Pancras railway station in London on Friday The UK and EU will resume face-to-face Brexit trade talks in London this weekend, as negotiators race to reach a deal before a looming deadline. It comes after EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier left a period of self-isolation after a colleague tested positive for Covid last week. Ahead of travelling to the UK, he said the""same significant divergences persist"",externalin negotiations. After arriving, he said he would work with ""patience and determination"". Earlier, Boris Johnson insisted the likelihood of a deal depended on the EU. Speaking on Friday, the prime minister told reporters that ""there's a deal there to be done if they want to do it"". But he added ""substantial and important differences"" remained between the two sides, with just over a month left before a December deadline. Negotiators are striving to strike a deal to govern their trading relationship once the UK's post-Brexit transition period ends in January 2021. Progress in tough areas of Brexit talks - EU chief Two government defeats in Lords over Brexit bill Brexit talks suspended after positive Covid test Talks have been continuing via video link for the past week or so, after the positive Covid-19 test in a member of Mr Barnier's team. Mr Barnier travelled to London after briefing EU ambassadors and members of the European Parliament on talks. ""In line with Belgian rules, my team and I are no longer in quarantine. Physical negotiations can continue,"" he wrote on Twitter. Ahead of in-person talks getting back under way, his UK counterpart Lord David Frost pledged to ""do my utmost"" see if a deal is possible. ""It is late, but a deal is still possible, and I will continue to talk until it's clear that it isn't,"" he tweeted on Friday. He added that any deal would have to ""fully respect UK sovereignty,"" including over fishing waters and a regime for subsidising businesses. ""An agreement on any other basis is not possible,"" he added. If the UK is holding off making compromises, in the hope of squeezing more last-minute concessions out of Brussels, it might be successful when it comes to fish. On Friday, we heard talk of Michel Barnier being about to propose that between 15% and 18% of the fish quota caught in UK waters by EU fleets would be restored to the UK under a free trade agreement. That was later dismissed by a number of European diplomats, as merely one of ""many proposals doing the rounds"". But whatever happens on the fish front - and Brussels knows it has some big compromises to make - as much as the EU wants a deal with the UK, it's unlikely to let go of its insistence on two other issues: common competition regulations and a tough means of policing them. Read more from Katya. Asked about the chances of an agreement, Mr Johnson said the ""likelihood of a deal is very much determined by our friends and partners in the EU"". He added that a trade agreement would ""benefit people on both sides of the Channel,"" but insisted the UK could ""prosper mightily"" without one. ""Everybody's working very hard - but clearly there are substantial and important differences to be bridged, but we're getting on with it."" The UK left the EU on 31 January, but it is continuing to follow the bloc's rules until the end of the year as part of an 11-month transition period. If a trade deal is not agreed by then, trading between the two will default to World Trade Organization (WTO) rules. The EU and UK can keep negotiating if they want to after this, but the two sides would face import taxes on goods traded between them. The UK would have no access to the EU's energy market, and no agreement on police and judicial co-operation. Fishing has been a major flashpoint in the talks, along with post-Brexit competition rules and how any deal would be enforced. The two sides are also at odds over how closely the UK should have to follow the EU's social, labour, and environmental standards after the transition. They are also haggling over how any rules in this area - including on ""state aid"" support for businesses - would be enforced as part of the agreement.

"The music producer, named only as Michel, spoke to reporters outside the National Police General Inspectorate in Paris French authorities have suspended three police officers after they were seen on video beating up a black music producer in central Paris. The incident on Saturday has prompted a fresh outcry over the conduct of French security forces. On Mondaypolice were accused of using unnecessary forceas they dismantled a makeshift migrant camp in Paris. The incidents come as the government tries to bring in laws banning the broadcast of police officers' faces. Critics of the legislation say that without such images, none of the incidents which took place over the past week would have come to light. Tough French immigration bill approved On Thursday, French football star Kylian Mbappe, who is black, joined national teammates and fellow athletes in condemning the latest incident. ""Unbearable video, unacceptable violence. Say no to racism,""he wrote on Twitter,externalnext to a picture of the bloodied face of the injured producer, who has been named only as Michel. The security camera video was published on Thursday by the online news site Loopsider. It shows three officers kicking, punching and using their truncheons on the man after he entered his studio.

Michel said that he was also subjected to racist abuse during the five minute beating. He was detained and charged with violence and resisting arrest, but prosecutors threw the charges out and instead opened an investigation against the officers. As he arrived at police headquarters on Thursday with his lawyer to file a complaint, Michel told reporters: ""People who should have been protecting me attacked me. I did nothing to deserve this. I just want these three people to be punished according to the law."" Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo said she was ""profoundly shocked"" by the ""intolerable act"". Interior Minister GÃ©rald Darmanin told French television that he would press for the officers' dismissal, saying they had ""soiled the uniform of the republic"".

"Halima Aden at Milan Fashion Week American model Halima Aden says she is quitting runway modelling as it compromises her religious beliefs. The 23-year-old has appeared on the cover of British Vogue, Vogue Arabia and Allure. Writing on Instagram, she said the coronavirus pandemic had given her time to stop and think about what her values are as a Muslim woman. ""Being a 'hijabi' is truly a journey with lots of highs and lows,"" she said. Talking about accepting modelling jobs that went against her religious views, she said: ""I can only blame myself for caring more about opportunity than what was actually at stake."" She added that problems came from there being a ""lack of Muslim women stylists"" within the industry who could understand why wearing a hijab was so important.

"Seven-year-old Emily Jones was stabbed as she played in Queen's Park, Bolton A seven-year-old girl had her throat cut in a random attack at a park on Mother's Day, a jury at Manchester Crown Court heard. Emily Jones was at Queen's Park in Bolton with her parents when she was attacked by Eltiona Skana, 30, on 22 March, the court was told. Ms Skana, 30, has admitted manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility but denies murder. She appeared at court via video link from high security Rampton Hospital. Michael Brady QC, prosecuting said Emily was on a scooter and had been brought to the park by her father Mark Jones. Moments before the attack Emily spotted her mother, Sarah Barnes, who was jogging around the park wearing headphones. Oblivious of the defendant she called out to her mum and scooted towards her some yards ahead of her father. Emily was grabbed by Ms Skana who ""in one movement"" cut the girl's throat and threw her to the ground, said Mr Brady. He added: ""There had been no interaction between Emily and the defendant."" In a statement read to the jury, Emily's father said: ""I do not know why this happened. Emily was simply riding her scooter to her mum. I simply can't explain it."" Ms Skana, who bought the knife earlier that day, fled but was chased by Tony Canty who was walking in the park with his wife Lynsey and their baby daughter. Mr Canty barged Ms Skana to the ground and detained her until police arrived. After her arrest, Ms Skana, originally from Albania, was assessed, telling the on-call psychiatrist ""I know I'm a paranoid schizophrenic"". She was detained under the Mental Health Act. Ms Skana was moved to the high-security hospital at Rampton where she told a psychiatrist, Dr Afghan, she had been ""psychotic, hearing and seeing things"". While there she may have had a possible psychotic episode and another time it was reported while watching a children's TV programme she began laughing hysterically when she saw a child who looked similar to Emily, the court heard. Ms Skana said she was ""perfectly normal"" before coming to the UK and claiming asylum in 2014, she told medics. The jury was also told she showed ""indifference"" to the killing and spoke with a ""smirk"" but also showed appropriate emotional response when talking about her own family. Speaking to a nurse at Rampton, Ms Skana said: ""Like I said, it's been three months, what do you want me to do cry all the time?"" She later told the same nurse: ""It was premeditated, I waited in a park and picked my victim, I did what I did, then tried to run away."" Mr Brady told jurors the main issue was whether Ms Skana's paranoid schizophrenia is the reason behind the killing or her illness is simply ""a convenient excuse behind which to hide"". The trial is scheduled for five days. Why not follow BBC North West onFacebook,external,Twitter,externalandInstagram,external?

"Halima Aden at Milan Fashion Week American model Halima Aden says she is quitting runway modelling as it compromises her religious beliefs. The 23-year-old has appeared on the cover of British Vogue, Vogue Arabia and Allure. Writing on Instagram, she said the coronavirus pandemic had given her time to stop and think about what her values are as a Muslim woman. ""Being a 'hijabi' is truly a journey with lots of highs and lows,"" she said. Talking about accepting modelling jobs that went against her religious views, she said: ""I can only blame myself for caring more about opportunity than what was actually at stake."" She added that problems came from there being a ""lack of Muslim women stylists"" within the industry who could understand why wearing a hijab was so important. She's received support online from model sisters Bella and Gigi Hadid and also from Rihanna. Allow Instagram content? This article contains content provided by Instagram.

Halima was born in a Kenyan refugee camp to Somali parents before moving to America aged six. She was spotted by international modelling agency IMG Models at 18 while appearing in the Miss Minnesota USA pageant as a semi-finalist. She was the first woman to wear a hijab in the pageant and soon became known for bringing a modest dress code to the world's most famous fashion week shows. She's gone on to star in campaigns for Rihanna's Fenty Beauty and Kanye West's Yeezy brand. Halima, seen here modelling for Tommy Hilfiger, made her runway debut at 19 at New York Fashion Week In her Instagram Stories, she praised Rihanna for letting her wear the hijab she wore to set. She says she's compromised her religion many times as part of her job - including missing prayer times set out in the Islamic faith or agreeing to model without a hijab on, using another item of clothing to cover her head. She added that she had ""sobbed"" in her hotel room after shooting some campaigns over not speaking up about what she thought was right. ""The truth is I was very uncomfortable,"" she wrote on Instagram. ""This just ain't me,"" she added.

"Jack Whitehall is a comedian, actor and TV presenter The BBC has upheld complaints from two viewers about a routine by comedian Jack Whitehall, featuring a joke about being at a pop concert with a dwarf. The offending bit, from a show broadcast in 2014, featured in a recent repeat of his Live at the Apollo set, which was shown on BBC Two. The BBC's Executive Complaints Unit has said it will not be re-broadcast. Whitehall, 32, has since said the two are still in touch, having become university friends after the concert. The complaints unit said: ""The ECU considered that viewers familiar with Whitehall's self-deprecating style of comedy would have understood the routine as intended primarily to show up his own inadequacies and failings, and to that extent if fell within audience expectations for stand-up comedy in a late evening slot. ""The ECU accepted, however, that there were occasions when it seemed a stereotypical view of dwarfism itself, rather than Jack Whitehall's own ineptitude, was the source of the humour, which took the routine beyond the expectations of audiences in relation to material of this kind."" Aside from his stand-up shows, Whitehall has hosted the Brit Awards on several occasions. He is perhaps best known for starring as JP in the series Fresh Meat; and as Alfie Wickers in the Bad Education TV and film series; as well appearing alongside his real life dad Michael, in Travels with My Father.

"PC Simon Read was found to have intentionally scanned the wrong barcode A police officer accused of trying to buy a Â£9.95 box of doughnuts for seven pence by sticking on a cheaper barcode has been sacked for gross misconduct. PC Simon Read, from Cambridgeshire Police, was found to have switched the price for the cakes at a Wisbech supermarket on 10 February. A misconduct hearing found he had breached professional standards of honesty and integrity. PC Read, who had denied the charges, was dismissed without notice. PC Read had previously worked at several royal weddings and a visit to Blenheim Palace by Donald Trump At the two-day hearing in Peterborough PC Read said he had made an honest mistake at a Tesco Extra self-service till. While in uniform, he said he purchased four items from the store - the tray of 12 doughnuts, the carrots, a sandwich and a drink. The hearing was told he scanned the carrots barcode twice and failed to scan the doughnuts barcode, paying around Â£4 for the items instead of about Â£14. He said: ""I simply scanned where I believed the barcodes were and placed them down (in the bagging area)."" The panel ruled his explanation was ""lacking in credibility"". A manager at Tesco Extra reported his ""suspicious"" actions to the police Sharmistha Michaels, chairwoman of the disciplinary panel, said: ""On the balance of probabilities we are satisfied that PC Read did intentionally scan the wrong barcode."" PC Read had previously said: ""I didn't check the screen. I wish I had have done."" Ms Michaels said CCTV footage showed him looking at it at the time as he selected his method of payment. She added that if he intended to pay the correct price he could have checked that he scanned the right barcode and it if was a ""genuine mistake"" he had opportunities to put it right. His actions were ""incompatible with his role as a police officer"". Mark Ley-Morgan, a lawyer who set out the misconduct case, said it was ""an officer effectively stealing while in uniform"". Carolina Bracken, PC Read's lawyer, said he had an ""unblemished career"", had served in the armed forces, before he joined Cambridgeshire police in January and had served with Thames Valley Police from 2008. Ms Bracken said the case weighed heavily on him and he had received prank calls in the night from people offering him doughnuts. PC Read has the right to appeal the decision. After the ruling the Jane Gyford, deputy Chief Constable of Cambridgeshire Police, said: ""The public should be able to trust that police officers in their duty will act with honesty and integrity at all times. ""I hope this outcome offers reassurance to our communities that our officers and staff will be held to account for their actions.""

"Scotland hopes to vaccinate a million people by the end of January A coronavirus vaccine will be ready to be used in Wales within a week of getting the go ahead, the first minister has said. Mark Drakeford said Welsh ministers are ""working on the capacity now. A lot of work has been done already"". England and Scotland have already made vaccine rollout announcements. Plaid Cymru called for an ""urgent, clear and comprehensive vaccination plan"", urging the Welsh Government not to be ""vague"" on such a key matter. Speaking toBBC Radio Cymru's Dros Ginio programme, Mr Drakeford said: ""What other places have done is shown an ambition. What we're doing here in Wales is to plan first before we make an announcement."" Covid vaccines: Who decides if they are safe? Covid vaccines: When will one be ready? A number of vaccines have recently reported successful trials but none have yet gained safety approval. Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said her government hopes to vaccinate a million people by the end of January, while in England they hope to have all vulnerable people vaccinated by Easter. Mr Drakeford said:""We don't know yet, and people in Scotland don't know yet, how much of the vaccine will be available because the system hasn't yet been set up."" On Wednesday, he told theBBC Wales Liveprogramme that If Wales were to use the Pfizer vaccine, which has to be stored at -70 degrees, that the plan is to use equipment from the Welsh Blood Service. ""We can use the equipment the Wales Blood service already has to store material at that temperature and we can make it available for this vaccine,"" he said. ""The vaccine will have limitations, it will be difficult to transport but we will find ways of doing it."" Last week Mark Drakeford warned against making ""eye-catching headlines which you then have to scramble to find a way to deliver"" Plaid Cymru's health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth said that ""seeing the kind of roll-out plans in Scotland just reinforces the need for such a clear plan in Wales"". ""We need to know how - once approval is given for the vaccine - the vaccine will be rolled out in Wales, including timings, recipients and logistics,"" he said. Asked about plans to tighten restrictions before Christmas, Mr Drakeford insisted the ""firebreak was successful"" and that ""it did everything we expected it to do"" but acknowledged the numbers of people with coronavirus were increasing. He said the Welsh Government was looking at what is happening in other parts of the UK to ""see if there are things we can learn and if there are things we can put in place to help us with the figures we're seeing now"". ""We accept that if we're going to do something in the hospitality sector then we're going to have to find more support for the sector and its supply chain,"" he said. Mr Drakeford said conversations were ongoing about how to find funds to support the hospitality sector and the best way to distribute it. He told Dros Ginio: ""We're working on things today- what money can we bring together and to what purpose can we use to help things but we haven't come to the end of those discussions yet.""

"A statue of Sir Thomas Picton was boxed up in preparation for its removal from Cardiff City Hall Wales has 209 streets, buildings, portraits or monuments commemorating people directly involved with the slave trade or who opposed its abolition. An audit also found ""commemoration of people of colour"" to be ""negligible"". The review was ordered by First Minister Mark Drakeford following protests prompted by thekilling of George Floyd in the US. Mr Drakeford said the audit ""helps us establish an honest picture of our history"". Commemorations identified included: 13 monuments, buildings or street names commemorating people who took part in the African slave trade 56 monuments, buildings or street names commemorating people who owned or directly benefited from plantations or mines worked by slaves 120 monuments, buildings or street names commemorating people who opposed abolition of the slave trade or slavery 20 monuments, buildings or street names commemorating people accused of crimes against black people, notably in colonial Africa The audit, led by Gaynor Legall, found commemorations of people connected with the slave trade were often shown without any accompanying interpretation to address matters of contention, so the figures were presented solely as role models rather than representatives of challenging aspects of the past. The audit also unearthed commemorations to anti-slavery activists across Wales, such as Henry Richard in Tregaron, Ceredigion, street names for Samuel Romilly and the Pantycelyn halls of residence at Aberystwyth University, Ceredigion. The Thomas Picton obelisk is on Picton Terrace in Carmarthen The report said: ""It is striking that the only sculpture depicting people of black heritage is not a monument to named individuals, but an anonymous statue group in Cardiff Bay."" A statue to celebrate the life and contributions of Wales'first black headteacher Betty Campbellis set to be placed in Cardiff, but not until next year. There have been widespread calls for the statues of slave owners and those who supported the slave trade to be removed, but some have opposed the idea. In July, a statue of a 19th Century slave owner Sir Thomas Pictonin Cardiff City Hall was covered over. In Denbigh, people will be consulted on removing a statuehonouring Victorian adventurer Henry Morton Stanleywho opponents claim had links to slavery. Ysgol Goronwy Owen in Benllech on Anglesey is mentioned in the audit as its namesake poet owned slaves. A statue of Henry Morton Stanley was installed in Denbigh town centre in 2010 ""While the tragic killing of George Floyd happened almost 4,000 miles away, it sparked global action that shone a light on racial inequality in society today,"" Mr Drakeford said. ""That inequality exists in Welsh society too and we must work towards a Wales which is more equal. ""This audit provides important evidence which helps us establish an honest picture of our history. ""This is not about rewriting our past or naming and shaming. It is about learning from the events of the past."" He said the audit was the ""first stage of a much bigger piece of work""  to ""consider how we move forward with this information as we seek to honour and celebrate our diverse communities"". The audit was led by Gaynor Legall, who was the first black woman city councillor in Wales Speaking to Claire Summers on BBC Radio Wales, Ms Legall said: ""We certainly were careful not to make recommendations - different people have different views, some feel more strongly than others. ""We would like to see some more commemorations of people of colour. ""We would like to see that this work is carried on, and perhaps incorporated into the new work around the curriculum, so that people in Wales - children, young people in particular - can have a true picture of where its economy grew from.""

"Families have been warned against hugging and kissing elderly relatives at Christmas ""if you want them to survive to be hugged again"". People ""just have to have sense"", said the UK government's chief medical adviser, Prof Chris Whitty. Coronavirus rules announced this week mean three households can form a bubble and mix for five days over Christmas. From 23 to 27 December, three households can mix indoors in homes, at a place of worship or outdoors. The rules apply to the whole of the UK,although in Scotlandthe number of people who can be in the Christmas bubble is limited to eight. And in Northern Ireland, the rules are relaxed from 22 to 28 December, to allow time to travel between the nations. What are the Christmas rules? PM Johnson on the new tough tier rules How to avoid catching Covid this Christmas Speaking at a Downing Street press conference on Thursday, Prof Whitty - who revealed he would be ""on the wards"" over Christmas - said: ""Would I want someone to see their family? Of course, that's what Christmas is about. ""But would I encourage someone to hug and kiss their elderly relatives? No, I would not. ""It's not against the law - and that's the whole point. You can do it within the rules that are there, but it does not make sense because you could be carrying the virus and if you've got an elderly relative, that would not be the thing you'd want to do in the period where we are running up to a point where we actually might be able to protect older people. ""So I think people just have to have sense. The fact that you can do something - this is true across so many other areas of life - doesn't mean you should."" Mr Whitty urged people not to do ""stupid things"" at Christmas Sir Patrick Vallance, the government's chief scientific adviser, added: ""It's not going to be a normal Christmas but if you want to make those connections with family, it has to be done in a way where you try and make sure that you don't increase the risk. ""I think hugging elderly relatives is not something to go out and do. It will increase the spread to a vulnerable population."" Prof Whitty added: ""If you want them to survive to be hugged again."" Prime Minister Boris Johnson also responded to the question about hugging elderly relatives, urging people to be ""common sensical"". ""Until the vaccine comes on stream, we are not out of the woods yet and we have to be very, very vigilant."" Prof Whitty also said it was ""not a secret"" that Christmas would increase the risk of transmission. ""Take it really seriously during Christmas. Don't do stupid things. Don't do unnecessary things just because the rules say you can. Think sensibly."" Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has that said the ""default advice"" and ""safest position"" was still that people should avoid contact. ""Just because we are allowing people to meet up in a limited way does not of course mean people have to do so, and people should not feel under pressure to do so,"" she said.

The NHS considers anyone 70 and over as ""clinically vulnerable"" and at moderate risk from coronavirus. The government guidance also has specific advice for people considered extremely vulnerable, as well as care home residents. It suggests forming a Christmas bubble is ""a personal choice"" for extremely vulnerable people, while those in care homes should only visit families if they are of working age. LOCKDOWN LOOK-UP:The rules in your area THREE TIERS:What are the new tiers? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters Under the government's rules, the three households must be fixed, so you will not be able to mix with two households on Christmas Day and two different ones on Boxing Day. Households in your Christmas bubble can't bubble with anyone else. Scotland has announced that the bubbles of three households should contain no more than eight people - but children under 12 are exempt. People who are self-isolating should not join a Christmas bubble. If someone tests positive, or develops coronavirus symptoms up to 48 hours after the Christmas bubble last met, everyone will have to self-isolate.

"This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon said countries would have to consider what type of society they wanted be after the Covid pandemic. Nicola Sturgeon has said a second independence referendum should be held ""in the earlier part"" of the next Scottish Parliament term. The SNP leader, who is also Scotland's first minister, said her focus was currently on guiding the country through the pandemic. But she insisted that the UK government's current opposition to indyref2 was unsustainable. She would not be drawn on what she might do if it consent was refused. Ms Sturgeon was being interviewed by the BBC ahead of the SNP's virtual conference which opens on Saturday and concludes on Monday with her leader's speech. The party, which has formed the Scottish government since 2007, believes that winning the next Holyrood election in May would give it a mandate to hold another referendum on independence. The UK government's Scottish independence dilemma UK ministers reject indyref2 'for a generation' Why are more Scots supporting independence? However, the UK government has repeatedly said it would not grant the consent that Ms Sturgeon has argued would be needed if any referendum was to be legal. It argues that the referendum result in 2014 - when voters rejected independence by 55% to 45% - still stands, and points to quotes at the time from both Ms Sturgeon and her predecessor, Alex Salmond, that it was a ""once in a generation"" event. And Scottish Secretary Alister Jack has said thereshould not be another referendum for ""25 or 40 years"". Some within the SNP and wider independence movement have urged Ms Sturgeon to develop a so-called Plan B strategy for securing a referendum if the UK government does not change its stance. Recent opinion polls now suggest a majority of people in Scotland are in favour of independence The include the prominent MP Joanna Cherry, who said on Friday that the Scottish Parliament should legislate to hold an independence referendum - even if the UK government refused agreement. She acknowledged that a Holyrood-only referendum would almost certainly face legal challenge because the UK constitution is not devolved. But Ms Cherry argued that there was nothing to be lost from testing this in court, if independence supporting parties win a majority of the seats at Holyrood. She is also urging Ms Sturgeon to restart independence planning, which has been suspended during the pandemic, if there is to be a referendum anytime soon. Ms Cherry and some of her allies are seeking election to the SNP's ruling body this weekend. Joanna Cherry is among those in the SNP who want Ms Sturgeon to set out a Plan B for securing a referendum Ian Blackford, the SNP's leader at Westminster, said earlier this month that thereferendum ""must"" be held next year,external- which critics argue would be all but impossible to do. Ms Sturgeon appeared to distance herself from that strict timescale, saying only that: ""I think the referendum should, for a whole variety of reasons, be in the earlier part of the next parliament."" She added: ""I intend to say more about this before the election in our manifesto, but we are still in a global pandemic that I feel a bit more hopeful about seeing the end of than I did even just a couple of months ago. ""There's still a lot of uncertainty ahead. I'm a life-long believer and campaigner and advocate for independence, but right now I'm also the first minister of Scotland. ""My responsibility is to the health and wellbeing of the country and trying to steer it through a pandemic and I'm very focused on that."" Indyref2: What does 'once in a generation' mean? However, she said countries across the world - including Scotland - would have to decide ""what kind of society we want to be"" as they emerge from the pandemic. The added element for Scotland, Ms Sturgeon predicted, would be questioning whether its future should be decided by ""a Westminster government that seems determined to take us in the wrong direction"" or a ""Scottish government, of whatever party in the future, that is accountable to the Scottish people"". And she insisted: ""If people in Scotland vote for a referendum, there will be a referendum. ""Across the Atlantic, even Trump is having to concede the outcome of a fair and free democratic election"". The Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross has said another independence referendum is ""the last thing Scotland needs"". ""Nicola Sturgeon says we should have another independence referendum 'sooner rather than later' and won't even rule one out next year,"" he said. ""The only thing to stop this and keep us focused on beating Covid and supporting our recovery after this virus is a vote for the Scottish Conservatives."" He called for the country to stay focused on beating Covid and supporting the recovery from the pandemic. Willie Rennie, the Scottish Liberal Democrat leader, said Scotland needed a government that was  focused ""needle sharp"" on recovery from the Covid crisis. He commented: ""Scotland has been through huge turmoil over the last nine months. We haven't even embarked on the economic recovery from the pandemic and the first minister wants to spend months or even years dividing the country over Scotland going its own way with independence."" It was confirmed last week that the number of deaths in Scotland which have been linked to Covid-19 had passed the 5,000 mark. Statistics released earlier in the year found that the country had seen one of the biggest rises in its death rates in Europe at the height of the pandemic - behind only England and Spain. But a poll for BBC Scotland which waspublished last weeksuggested that people are largely supportive of Ms Sturgeon's handling of the pandemic. When asked what mistakes she had made during her response to the crisis, Ms Sturgeon said some of the early decisions had been based on a ""under-developed knowledge"" of the virus. This impacted on the length of time it took it introduce regular testing in care homes - something she said she ""deeply regrets"". Ms Sturgeon admitted that her relationship with predecessor Alex Salmond has broken down Ms Sturgeon has been involved in a bitter war of words with her predecessor, Mr Salmond, over her government's handling of harassment allegations that were made against him. The Scottish government paid Mr Salmond's legal fees of Â£500,000 after it admitted acting unlawfully during its investigation, with a Holyrood inquiry currently investigating the affair. A separate inquiry is also examining whether Ms Sturgeon may have broken the ministerial code. When asked whether she would resign if she was found to have broken that code, Ms Sturgeon said she would not speculate on the outcome but added that she was ""satisfied in my conduct and the decisions I took"". However, she admitted that her relationship with Mr Salmond had ""broken down"". How is Holyrood's Alex Salmond inquiry going? She added: ""These are deeply personal matters. Alex Salmond is somebody who I have been close to for a very long time, so there is a degree of personal pain for all sorts of people in this. ""But I'm also mindful that in talking about this, this whole thing all started off because women came forward with complaints. ""At every stage all I've tried to do is make sure that complaints that came forward, whoever they were about, could be properly investigated without fear or favour"".

"Defendants were paraded when the mass trial opened in August 2017 A court in Turkey has given life sentences to 337 military officers and others, in one of the biggest trials linked to the 2016 coup attempt. Air force pilots and army commanders were among the nearly 500 defendants accused of trying to overthrow President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. They allegedly directed the plot from the Akinci air base near Ankara. Mr Erdogan says US-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen masterminded the plot, which led to mass arrests. Mr Gulen has denied any involvement in the attempted coup in July 2016 that killed 251 people and injured more than 2,000. Mr Erdogan was on vacation at the time at a resort. Thousands of civilians rallied in support of Mr Erdogan in a night of turmoil, confronting rogue soldiers and preventing the plotters from seizing power. Nearly 500 on trial over Turkey coup plot Five years with turbulent Turkey's 'militant people' Erdogan: Turkey's pugnacious president The trial began in August 2017, and the charges included seeking to kill President Erdogan and seize key state institutions. Turkey's biggest court - in Sincan near Ankara - was packed for the verdicts. Security was tight for the high-profile trial at the Sincan prison complex Officers who conspired against Mr Erdogan seized aircraft at the Akinci base, taking then chief of staff Gen Hulusi Akar and some other officers hostage. Former air force commander Akin Ozturk was jailed for life last year for his role in the plot. The indictment states that 25 pilots in F-16s bombed targets in Ankara, including parliament, which was hit three times, as well as key security buildings. The bombing killed 68 people in Ankara and injured more than 200. Twenty-five of those in the dock were generals and 10 were civilians. More than 10 of the military officers - including F-16 fighter pilots - and four civilians got 79 ""aggravated"" life sentences each. The ""aggravated"" sentence requires harsher prison terms than for a normal life sentence. This video can not be played Alleged coup plotters outside the court near Ankara in 2017 Six were put on trial in absentia, including Mr Gulen and Adil Oksuz, a theology lecturer accused of being a key co-ordinator in the coup plot. Among those receiving ""aggravated"" life terms was businessman Kemal Batmaz, accused of assisting Adil Oksuz. Turkey's trauma after night of the tanks What is Turkey's Gulen movement? The Hizmet movement led by Mr Gulen has been branded a ""terrorist"" organisation by Mr Erdogan. He was once an ally of the president, but since the coup attempt the 79-year-old cleric has remained a fugitive in Pennsylvania and Turkey wants his extradition. Mr Erdogan carried out a sweeping purge of state institutions after the plot, sacking or suspending more than 100,000 public sector employees, including teachers and judges, who were accused of links to Mr Gulen. There have been many trials of alleged plotters and courts have issued more than 2,500 life sentences. Turkey's trauma after night of the tanks What is Turkey's Gulen movement?

"New tough measures for England are the best way of avoiding another national lockdown, PM Boris Johnson tells a No 10 briefing England faces a ""hard winter"" but we must suppress the virus until vaccines ""come to our aid"", he says Chief Scientific Adviser Sir Patrick Vallance says the number of UK cases is still high but have started to ""turn the corner"" New coronavirus tier arrangements for England have been set out by the health secretary in the Commons They mean 55 million people will be in tiers 2 or 3 and remain banned from mixing with other households indoors after 2 December Elsewhere, in a Thanksgiving speech, US President-elect Joe Biden says ""we're at war with a virus, not with one another"" There have been more than 60 million coronavirus cases and 1.4 million deaths across the globe, according to Johns Hopkins University Edited by Sarah Fowler and Martha Buckley Many thanks for joining us today.

Danny AeberhardEurope regional editor, BBC World Service The Museum of London has launched an unusual project to capture how the coronavirus pandemic is affecting Londoners' lives - by collecting their dreams. The museum is working with researchers on dreams at a Canadian research institute. Sigmund Freud described dreams as the ""guardians of sleep"" - a description used as the name of the project, which the Museum of London says is the first of its kind. It seeks to document the effects of the pandemic on the subconscious of Londoners, as they work through some of the struggles and anxieties of the crisis in their sleep. The curator, Foteini Aravani, says people's testimonies will help to provide a more emotional and personal narrative for future generations. Just as many people might be feeling disappointed, frustrated and worried by the new tier system for England, so are MPs, with many in the House of Commons feeling the same way, says BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg. Some of the government's own Conservative MPs might even vote against the plan when it goes before them in the middle of next week. But ""while it might be bumpy"", there is ""not a realistic chance"" of it being blocked in any way. ""Like it or not, this is what is due to come in next Wednesday as the government tries to get control of this disease,"" she adds. Ski lifts stand idle at the resort of Les Menuires in the French Alps Would-be skiers in France have been left baffled after the prime minister said that winter resorts could open in the Alps and Pyrenees for the Christmas period - but that ski lifts would have to remain shut. Jean Castex said that mountain holidays were still a possibility, but that skiing was effectively ruled out. Hotels at resorts would be able to open when the country's national lockdown is lifted on 15 December, he said, while bars and restaurants will remain shut until January at the earliest. French President Emmanuel Macron said earlier this week thatFrance's ski resorts may have to remain closed until next yearbecause the current risks associated with the virus made it difficult for such sports to resume. He said he would discuss the issue with other European leaders and keep the decision under review. Ski resorts were responsible for numerous outbreaks of Covid-19 cases across Europe in the early days of the pandemic. Italy, Austria and Germany have all ordered lifts - even the high-altitude ones - at ski resorts to remain closed for the time being. But Switzerland is allowing ski resorts to remain open as long as they have strict safety measures in place, the health minister said today. David PittamBBC News Online Lia
Primrose (pictured left) is studying health and social care at college. The 17-year-old said: ""It
just feels like a bit of a kick in the teeth after cases went down so much. I work as a waitress so it'll affect me - I can't go back to work now. ""We
watched the announcement in class and he actually said tier two first, then said 'Oh sorry, tier three.' It was the biggest heartbreak. ""My age group is in a
weird place - we're at an age where we're expected to get Christmas presents for
people but we don't have the money because we can't work."" Her classmate, Poppi West, also 17, added:"" It's annoying that we keep going in and out - it feels like we're going round in circles. ""I know it's not the biggest issue but we're both nearly 18 and we won't be able to go out and have a drink to celebrate. It's just a bit sad."" Mass testing was piloted in Liverpool Liam Thorp of the Liverpool Echo asks whether Boris Johnson will increase funding for people who are self-isolating. He also notes that the city hasn't had the best relationship with the Conservatives in the past and asks the PM if he will remember Liverpool's efforts in the future when making funding decisions. ""What's happened in Liverpool has been fantastic,"" replies the prime minister. He says it is not just the testing programme but the way ""everyone pulled together to get the virus down"". ""We are going to keep supporting you throughout Covid and beyond,"" he promises. And that is the last question of today's press conference. Ben Glaze of the Daily Mirror asks if it is a good idea for people to be travelling across the country to hug and kiss elderly relatives. The PM says it has been an ""incredibly difficult decision"" as ministers have to balance people's strong desire to celebrate a family holiday - adding ""which frankly they're going do do anyway"" - and keeping the virus under control. He urges everyone to be ""commonsensical"" and ""do the right thing"". ""Until the vaccine comes on stream, we are not out of the woods yet and we have to be very, very vigilant,"" he adds. Prof Whitty says he would want people to see family, but adds: ""Would I encourage someone to hug and kiss elderly relatives? No, I would not."" He adds while it is not against the law, it does not make sense as you could be carrying the virus. ""The fact you can do something, doesn't mean you should."" Speaking of his own plans for Christmas, he says he will spend it on hospital wards. Sir Patrick Vallance says the key thing is to follow the basic rules of keeping distance where you can, keeping areas well-ventilated and so on. It will not be a normal Christmas and ""hugging elderly relatives is not something to do,"" he adds. They want to survive to be hugged again, adds Whitty.  This video can not be played Coronavirus: 'Take it really seriously during Christmas' Dominic Yeatman of the Metro asks if it is fair that pubs and restaurants forced to close will get support but the businesses that depend on them will not. He also asks if people will still stick to the rules if they believe the end of the virus is in sight. Boris Johnson says closed businesses do deserve protection and cites business grants and the furlough scheme as examples of government help. On the second question, Chris Whitty says he believes people will abide by the rules adding that the ""really heartening thing of this whole dreadful period"" has been the altruism, self-discipline and patience of the British public. ""You can always find some people who haven't followed the rules but they are in the minority,"" he says. Sky News's Beth Rigby asks about the loosening of restrictions over Christmas and whether a rise in cases is anticipated, leading to stricter rules before and afterwards. Prof Chris Whitty says Christmas will increase the risk: ""Everyone knows that, it's not a secret at all."" But it is not the only risk over this next period, he adds, with January and February the most difficult time for the NHS and a ""time of extreme pressure"". It is ""not the time of year where we want to be taking reckless decisions"" because ""things will be difficult for several months"", he adds. Christmas is an element of that but only one element. Christmas can be enjoyed without a spike in cases if people ""take it really seriously"" and ""don't do unnecessary things, just because you can"". People should ""take sensible precautions"", he adds. A number of Conservative MPs have lashed out at the introduction of new tiered Covid restrictions in England. The majority of the country will be placed in the two toughest levels when national lockdown ends on 2 December. The Covid Recovery Group, made up of Tory backbenchers, described the move as ""authoritarianism at work"". The group's deputy chair, Tory MP Steve Baker, called the announcement ""truly appalling"" and questioned if it was ""necessary and proportionate"" to the threat from coronavirus. The government has promised to publish an impact assessment early next week before MPs get a chance to vote on the new rules on Tuesday. But a revolt is brewing among the government's own MPs, including the chair of the influential 1922 committee of backbenchers, Sir Graham Brady. Read more. Military personnel helped at test sites in Liverpool Beth Rigby of Sky News asks how mass testing could be delivered to 40% of the population - asking if the whole British Army would have to be deployed. The PM replies he doesn't ""want to over-sell"" how easy it is to do it, and it ""depends on strong local leadership"" and ""real spirit"" in the local community. It is also ""only part of the panoply of interventions you need to defeat the disease"", he adds. The Army will help and support where necessary, but the key thing is local leaders saying they want the mass testing and the ""local will"" for it to be done. There will be ""adequate personnel"" and there are ""huge stocks"" of the lateral flow tests themselves right now, says Boris Johnson, adding there is hope they'll be made in the UK eventually.  ITV's Robert Peston asks the PM whether he will have to raise taxes and cut spending as a result of the pandemic. He also asks why the government's ""whack-a-mole"" strategy ""didn't work"". On the economy, Boris Johnson says his government is taking steps to ensure the country can ""bounce back from Covid"". ""It will need fiscal prudence - and that you will get from this government,"" he adds. On the lockdown strategy, Chris Whitty says, ""There are tiers that would work in the spring and summer which I would not expect to work at this stage."" Patrick Vallance says implementing weaker restrictions now would mean the government would have to resort to ""much more drastic measures"" later on. ""Madness is doing the same thing twice and expecting different results,"" Whitty adds. Chris MasonPolitical Correspondent The news conference can be summed up like this: the scientists say cases will rise in tier one, they'll hold steady in tier two and they'll fall under tier three. The prime minister wants to offer hope: ""Your tier is not your destiny,"" he says, and, ""By April things will genuinely be much, much better."" But, he adds, we must not ""take our foot off the throat of the beast now"". Boris Johnson knows there is a noisy collection of his own backbenchers who are spitting with anger over what the government's announced. And Labour are yet to commit to backing the government in next week's vote on this - they're expected to decide early next week once they have had the chance to speak to the government's experts. So this is Mr Johnson's case for why his plan is both necessary and, in his view, sensible. Laura Kuenssberg, political editor at BBC News, asks what the point of the national lockdown was if people are now moving to tougher restrictions. Boris Johnson replies it is ""very important"" for everyone to understand that ""this is not continuing the lockdown,"" with shops, hairdressers, gyms and places of worship among the venues reopening. ""This is a very different thing,"" he adds. ""What we have to do is keep eyes on the prize. In a few months we will have a vaccine, I'm absolutely convinced of it now. ""By April things will generally be much, much better."" He warns of relaxing too much now - taking our ""foot off the throat of the beast"" - when we are in a ""much better place"" than before the national lockdown. There are long months ahead but we are not abandoning the fight, he says. He stresses there is now option of mass testing, especially for tier-three communities ""who feel they have endured so much for so long"". Whitty is asked why more areas were not moved to tier three - and he replies that the government was keen to do enough to keep the R below one - but not to do anything unnecessary. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent It's clear the government now has greater confidence about the
impact the regional tiers will have. Research by the University of East Anglia
has shown that tier three is effective at suppressing the virus and tier two
stopped it from rising. Both of these tiers have been beefed up â in particular
around hospitality. The hope of government is that by going in hard and
placing nearly all of England in one of the top two tier, then in the coming
months areas will be able to drop down the tiers. The example of Liverpool is one that offers hope - it has
been placed in tier two, down from tier three before lockdown. The city used the new tool in the armoury â rapid mass
testing. The availability of these tests â which do not need to be
sent to the lab to be processed â is, ministers believe, a way of avoiding a
third lockdown and making progress during winter. Richard from Lancaster asks if the new vaccine will still work if Covid mutates. Patrick Vallance replies, ""This virus doesn't mutate as often as the flu virus but it does mutate."" He says none of the Covid mutations so far have changed in a way that would make the vaccines less effective but it is possible that future mutations might require new vaccines. He adds that making new vaccines would be possible, and points out this is what happens with flu vaccines every year. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Defendants were paraded when the mass trial opened in August 2017 A court in Turkey has given life sentences to 337 military officers and others, in one of the biggest trials linked to the 2016 coup attempt. Air force pilots and army commanders were among the nearly 500 defendants accused of trying to overthrow President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. They allegedly directed the plot from the Akinci air base near Ankara. Mr Erdogan says US-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen masterminded the plot, which led to mass arrests. Mr Gulen has denied any involvement in the attempted coup in July 2016 that killed 251 people and injured more than 2,000. Mr Erdogan was on vacation at the time at a resort. Thousands of civilians rallied in support of Mr Erdogan in a night of turmoil, confronting rogue soldiers and preventing the plotters from seizing power. Nearly 500 on trial over Turkey coup plot Five years with turbulent Turkey's 'militant people' Erdogan: Turkey's pugnacious president The trial began in August 2017, and the charges included seeking to kill President Erdogan and seize key state institutions. Turkey's biggest court - in Sincan near Ankara - was packed for the verdicts. Security was tight for the high-profile trial at the Sincan prison complex Officers who conspired against Mr Erdogan seized aircraft at the Akinci base, taking then chief of staff Gen Hulusi Akar and some other officers hostage. Former air force commander Akin Ozturk was jailed for life last year for his role in the plot. The indictment states that 25 pilots in F-16s bombed targets in Ankara, including parliament, which was hit three times, as well as key security buildings. The bombing killed 68 people in Ankara and injured more than 200. Twenty-five of those in the dock were generals and 10 were civilians. More than 10 of the military officers - including F-16 fighter pilots - and four civilians got 79 ""aggravated"" life sentences each. The ""aggravated"" sentence requires harsher prison terms than for a normal life sentence. This video can not be played Alleged coup plotters outside the court near Ankara in 2017 Six were put on trial in absentia, including Mr Gulen and Adil Oksuz, a theology lecturer accused of being a key co-ordinator in the coup plot. Among those receiving ""aggravated"" life terms was businessman Kemal Batmaz, accused of assisting Adil Oksuz. Turkey's trauma after night of the tanks What is Turkey's Gulen movement? The Hizmet movement led by Mr Gulen has been branded a ""terrorist"" organisation by Mr Erdogan. He was once an ally of the president, but since the coup attempt the 79-year-old cleric has remained a fugitive in Pennsylvania and Turkey wants his extradition. Mr Erdogan carried out a sweeping purge of state institutions after the plot, sacking or suspending more than 100,000 public sector employees, including teachers and judges, who were accused of links to Mr Gulen. There have been many trials of alleged plotters and courts have issued more than 2,500 life sentences. Turkey's trauma after night of the tanks What is Turkey's Gulen movement?

"New tough measures for England are the best way of avoiding another national lockdown, PM Boris Johnson tells a No 10 briefing England faces a ""hard winter"" but we must suppress the virus until vaccines ""come to our aid"", he says Chief Scientific Adviser Sir Patrick Vallance says the number of UK cases is still high but have started to ""turn the corner"" New coronavirus tier arrangements for England have been set out by the health secretary in the Commons They mean 55 million people will be in tiers 2 or 3 and remain banned from mixing with other households indoors after 2 December Elsewhere, in a Thanksgiving speech, US President-elect Joe Biden says ""we're at war with a virus, not with one another"" There have been more than 60 million coronavirus cases and 1.4 million deaths across the globe, according to Johns Hopkins University Edited by Sarah Fowler and Martha Buckley Many thanks for joining us today. The live page coverage has been brought to you by: Martha Buckley, Alice Evans, Sarah Fowler, Becky Morton, Mal Siret, Lauren Turner and Kate Whannel. Thanks for joining us today - we will be bringing our live page coverage to a close soon, on what has been a busy day of announcements. Here's a round-up of some of the main headlines. This video can not be played Boris Johnson: 'Your tier is not your destiny' Prime Minister Boris Johnson says the new approach is designed so that regions can move down the scale of restrictions, adding ""your tier is not your destiny"". People have been asked to watch the 94th Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade in New York on their televisions Some of the dayâs key developments from around the world

Read more here. Danny AeberhardEurope regional editor, BBC World Service The Museum of London has launched an unusual project to capture how the coronavirus pandemic is affecting Londoners' lives - by collecting their dreams. The museum is working with researchers on dreams at a Canadian research institute. Sigmund Freud described dreams as the ""guardians of sleep"" - a description used as the name of the project, which the Museum of London says is the first of its kind. It seeks to document the effects of the pandemic on the subconscious of Londoners, as they work through some of the struggles and anxieties of the crisis in their sleep. The curator, Foteini Aravani, says people's testimonies will help to provide a more emotional and personal narrative for future generations. Just as many people might be feeling disappointed, frustrated and worried by the new tier system for England, so are MPs, with many in the House of Commons feeling the same way, says BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg. Some of the government's own Conservative MPs might even vote against the plan when it goes before them in the middle of next week. But ""while it might be bumpy"", there is ""not a realistic chance"" of it being blocked in any way. ""Like it or not, this is what is due to come in next Wednesday as the government tries to get control of this disease,"" she adds. Ski lifts stand idle at the resort of Les Menuires in the French Alps Would-be skiers in France have been left baffled after the prime minister said that winter resorts could open in the Alps and Pyrenees for the Christmas period - but that ski lifts would have to remain shut. Jean Castex said that mountain holidays were still a possibility, but that skiing was effectively ruled out. Hotels at resorts would be able to open when the country's national lockdown is lifted on 15 December, he said, while bars and restaurants will remain shut until January at the earliest. French President Emmanuel Macron said earlier this week thatFrance's ski resorts may have to remain closed until next yearbecause the current risks associated with the virus made it difficult for such sports to resume. He said he would discuss the issue with other European leaders and keep the decision under review. Ski resorts were responsible for numerous outbreaks of Covid-19 cases across Europe in the early days of the pandemic. Italy, Austria and Germany have all ordered lifts - even the high-altitude ones - at ski resorts to remain closed for the time being. But Switzerland is allowing ski resorts to remain open as long as they have strict safety measures in place, the health minister said today. David PittamBBC News Online Lia
Primrose (pictured left) is studying health and social care at college. The 17-year-old said: ""It
just feels like a bit of a kick in the teeth after cases went down so much. I work as a waitress so it'll affect me - I can't go back to work now. ""We
watched the announcement in class and he actually said tier two first, then said 'Oh sorry, tier three.' It was the biggest heartbreak. ""My age group is in a
weird place - we're at an age where we're expected to get Christmas presents for
people but we don't have the money because we can't work."" Her classmate, Poppi West, also 17, added:"" It's annoying that we keep going in and out - it feels like we're going round in circles. ""I know it's not the biggest issue but we're both nearly 18 and we won't be able to go out and have a drink to celebrate. It's just a bit sad."" Mass testing was piloted in Liverpool Liam Thorp of the Liverpool Echo asks whether Boris Johnson will increase funding for people who are self-isolating. He also notes that the city hasn't had the best relationship with the Conservatives in the past and asks the PM if he will remember Liverpool's efforts in the future when making funding decisions. ""What's happened in Liverpool has been fantastic,"" replies the prime minister. He says it is not just the testing programme but the way ""everyone pulled together to get the virus down"". ""We are going to keep supporting you throughout Covid and beyond,"" he promises. And that is the last question of today's press conference. Ben Glaze of the Daily Mirror asks if it is a good idea for people to be travelling across the country to hug and kiss elderly relatives. The PM says it has been an ""incredibly difficult decision"" as ministers have to balance people's strong desire to celebrate a family holiday - adding ""which frankly they're going do do anyway"" - and keeping the virus under control. He urges everyone to be ""commonsensical"" and ""do the right thing"". ""Until the vaccine comes on stream, we are not out of the woods yet and we have to be very, very vigilant,"" he adds. Prof Whitty says he would want people to see family, but adds: ""Would I encourage someone to hug and kiss elderly relatives? No, I would not."" He adds while it is not against the law, it does not make sense as you could be carrying the virus. ""The fact you can do something, doesn't mean you should."" Speaking of his own plans for Christmas, he says he will spend it on hospital wards. Sir Patrick Vallance says the key thing is to follow the basic rules of keeping distance where you can, keeping areas well-ventilated and so on. It will not be a normal Christmas and ""hugging elderly relatives is not something to do,"" he adds. They want to survive to be hugged again, adds Whitty.  This video can not be played Coronavirus: 'Take it really seriously during Christmas' Dominic Yeatman of the Metro asks if it is fair that pubs and restaurants forced to close will get support but the businesses that depend on them will not. He also asks if people will still stick to the rules if they believe the end of the virus is in sight. Boris Johnson says closed businesses do deserve protection and cites business grants and the furlough scheme as examples of government help. On the second question, Chris Whitty says he believes people will abide by the rules adding that the ""really heartening thing of this whole dreadful period"" has been the altruism, self-discipline and patience of the British public.

"Six women in Northern Ireland have been murdered since 2015 despite previously reporting their violent partners to the police. One woman contacted the police eight times before she was killed, figures obtained by BBC News NI showed. The family of one of the women said tougher legislation is needed to protect women. A new bill to strengthen NI's domestic abuse legislation is currently being considered by the assembly. Police said they would welcome more protection in law for victims. Domestic abuse bill for NI closer to becoming law More than 50 domestic crimes a day in NI Connie Leonard wasmurdered at her home in in Maguiresbridge, County Fermanagh, in 2017. Her brother Fergal said police needed to be given stronger powers to tackle domestic violence. He told the BBC: ""There are a number of matters I feel that could have been acted on and may have saved Connie's life."" ""The last person in the world that I thought something would have happened to is Connie."" Ms Leonard and her son Conor, who has Down's syndrome, were attacked by 55-year-old Peadar Phair, a former partner of Ms Leonard. She had reported Phair three times before she was murdered and she had taken out a non-molestation order against him. Phair later took his own life. Connie Leonard was stabbed to death in front of her son Police, Mr Leonard said, must ""know what their powers are and that they use these powers effectively"". There must be ""proper monitoring and following up"" and officers must know ""what actions they are supposed to take"". The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI), which released the figures to the BBC following a freedom of information request, said it would welcome more protection in law for victims of domestic abuse. Det Ch Insp Lindsay Fisher said: ""In terms of legislation, police are very much bound by and uphold the law. ""Therefore we are always acting within the law in terms of our response to domestic abuse matters or any other crime. ""Police would welcome any further legislation that would support victims of domestic abuse and would seek to bring offenders to justice."" Det Ch Insp Fisher urged anyone suffering from abuse to ""reach out to police or to a family member"". She added: ""The PSNI is here to help victims of domestic abuse and we do have enhanced support services in place."" Justice Minister Naomi Long said the process of strengthening NI's laws is under way. She said she was considering the introduction of Domestic Violence Protection Orders, which allow police in other parts of the UK to intervene where they believe a person to be at risk, but do not have enough evidence to bring a criminal charge. She said: ""I have signed off last night on a consultation process on domestic abuse protection notices and orders. That will happen over the next number of weeks."" Naomi Long said the process of strengthening NI's laws is under way Separately, a bill to strengthen domestic abuse legislationreturns to Stormont in December. It will mean domestic abuse offences in Northern Ireland will no longer be limited to physically violent behaviour. It will make a form of bullying, known as coercive control, an offence in Northern Ireland for the first time. Convictions for the most serious domestic abuse offences will carry a penalty of up to 14 years in jail. Sonya McMullan from Woman's Aid Northern Ireland said  police need ""more robust powers"" in relation to domestic abuse. He said: ""Legislation which is in other parts of the UK is not here in Northern Ireland. ""That is just not good enough in regard to protection orders and emergency orders that would give the police more powers to remove the perpetrator and to get an order themselves. ""We need emergency barring orders and powers that takes the onus off the victim and where the police get that order with or without the victim's consent"".

"With England's lockdown coming to an end, it's all change. A new system of regional tiers will come into force next week. That will be followed by a relaxation of rules at Christmas across the UK which will allow up to three households to meet over the festive period. But scientists are warning the move risks a third wave of Covid. Is the government making a mistake? Scientists have been pretty vocal about their concerns. Prof Andrew Hayward, an expert in infectious diseases at University College London and member of the government's Scientific Advisory Group on Emergencies (Sage), believes the relaxation of restrictions at Christmas is tantamount to ""throwing fuel on the Covid fire"". He warns it is likely to lead to a third wave of infection with ""hospitals being overrun and more unnecessary deaths"". This video can not be played How you and your family can celebrate Christmas and minimise the spread of coronavirus Edinburgh University global public health chair Prof Devi Sridhar, who advises the Scottish government, agrees. She says she cannot understand the move given that the rollout of vaccines is so close. ""Why risk getting infected and infecting others over the holidays? Delaying by a few months is perfectly rational given solutions within sight in the spring."" She now fears we will ""pay for"" Christmas with lockdowns in the new year. What are the Covid rules at Christmas? What is certainly true is that more mixing will lead to more infections. That is a given since the virus thrives on human contact. But there is an argument that what the government is doing will actually help curb infections in both the short and long-term. Modelling done for the government has suggested that for every day of restrictions being relaxed, five days of tougher ones are needed. But others advising ministers think this way of looking at things is too one-dimensional. ""The problem with the modellers,"" says a member of SPI-B, the government committee that advises on human behaviour, ""is that they see a nut and reach for the sledgehammer. ""Banning Christmas was never going to work. People were not going to follow the rules. Providing guidance to help them celebrate safely is perhaps a much better way of managing the situation."" The UK is also not unique in taking this approach. France has announced it will be relaxing the rules at Christmas and other parts of Europe look likely to follow suit in the coming weeks. Prof Stephen Reicher, an expert in social psychology at the University of St Andrews who also sits on SPI-B, says it is impossible to know to what extent the public would have followed the restrictions at Christmas had they remained in place. But he says there was certainly a danger that people would have ""asserted their will"", arguing: ""People don't like being lectured to."" He says that by providing people with the autonomy to make their own decisions, you encourage people to take more responsibility and become actively engaged in working out the best choice to make. And he thinks the pivot from ""paternalism to partnership"" could actually help build trust in the longer term, which will stand the UK in good stead for the rest of the winter in terms of adherence to restrictions and take-up of the vaccine. How to avoid catching Covid this Christmas More trust is certainly needed. Polling by YouGov shows public trust in the government has halved since the spring, with just a third of people happy with its handling of the pandemic. Prof Reicher says what the government has to do now is provide good, clear advice on how to reduce the risks, from ensuring rooms are ventilated to the benefits of isolating before getting together. But he would also like to see some more practical support. As an example, he says the government could provide ""Covid fuel allowances"" to allow people to leave windows open and the heating on during Christmas. Another idea, he says, would be to introduce an extra bank holiday at Easter to provide an incentive to delay family get-togethers to a time when those at most risk are likely to have been vaccinated, and the change in the seasons means there is likely to be less virus around. There are some signs the government is moving in this direction. Ministers have being speaking about the need to use the opportunity to meet up responsibly - with the key message being just because you can, it does not mean you have to. A crucial consideration will, of course, be assessing who is the most vulnerable in each Christmas bubble. Age is the overriding factor when it comes to risk from Covid. But as well as minimising risk, there is also a need to assess the benefits. For some, this could be the last chance they have of a family Christmas. And, even where that is not the case, a year spent not seeing family and being isolated from people has clearly taken its toll. Prof Paul Hunter, from the University of East Anglia's school of medicine, says the benefits on people's mental health of being able to meet up with family over this time ""should not be underestimated"". Indeed, he believes for some it will provide the boost that people need to ""make it through the rest of winter"". But the other factor that is just as important - and this was a point made earlier this week by England's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty - is adherence to the regional tier restrictions in the lead up to Christmas and afterwards. Doing this, he says, will minimise the risks. The move into lockdown was widely interpreted as a sign the regional tiers introduced in mid October were not working. But infection rates were actually stabilising by the time lockdown came in as the chart below shows. And now ananalysis by the University of East Anglia,externalhas shed more light on how they could be more effective. It looked at infection rates across 315 local authority areas across England during the period where tiers were used. It found the tier with the least restrictions - tier one - was largely inadequate in that it was unable to control the virus because rates of infection were too high. Tier two was effective in about half of local authority areas placed in it, while tier three was good enough to drive the R number measuring the rate of infection below one. One of the key problems, the research said, was the fact that areas were often not moved into a higher tier quickly enough. The government says it will learn the lessons from that. It has already moved to beef up the tiers - the top two will see tighter restrictions on hospitality in particular. The hope is that a more intelligent use of the system coupled with the Christmas boost to the public's resolve could suppress virus enough to avoid another lockdown and get us through winter.

"New tough measures for England are the best way of avoiding another national lockdown, PM Boris Johnson tells a No 10 briefing England faces a ""hard winter"" but we must suppress the virus until vaccines ""come to our aid"", he says Chief Scientific Adviser Sir Patrick Vallance says the number of UK cases is still high but have started to ""turn the corner"" New coronavirus tier arrangements for England have been set out by the health secretary in the Commons They mean 55 million people will be in tiers 2 or 3 and remain banned from mixing with other households indoors after 2 December Elsewhere, in a Thanksgiving speech, US President-elect Joe Biden says ""we're at war with a virus, not with one another"" There have been more than 60 million coronavirus cases and 1.4 million deaths across the globe, according to Johns Hopkins University Edited by Sarah Fowler and Martha Buckley Many thanks for joining us today.

This video can not be played Boris Johnson: 'Your tier is not your destiny' Prime Minister Boris Johnson says the new approach is designed so that regions can move down the scale of restrictions, adding ""your tier is not your destiny"".

Danny AeberhardEurope regional editor, BBC World Service The Museum of London has launched an unusual project to capture how the coronavirus pandemic is affecting Londoners' lives - by collecting their dreams. The museum is working with researchers on dreams at a Canadian research institute. Sigmund Freud described dreams as the ""guardians of sleep"" - a description used as the name of the project, which the Museum of London says is the first of its kind. It seeks to document the effects of the pandemic on the subconscious of Londoners, as they work through some of the struggles and anxieties of the crisis in their sleep. The curator, Foteini Aravani, says people's testimonies will help to provide a more emotional and personal narrative for future generations. Just as many people might be feeling disappointed, frustrated and worried by the new tier system for England, so are MPs, with many in the House of Commons feeling the same way, says BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg. Some of the government's own Conservative MPs might even vote against the plan when it goes before them in the middle of next week. But ""while it might be bumpy"", there is ""not a realistic chance"" of it being blocked in any way. ""Like it or not, this is what is due to come in next Wednesday as the government tries to get control of this disease,"" she adds. Ski lifts stand idle at the resort of Les Menuires in the French Alps Would-be skiers in France have been left baffled after the prime minister said that winter resorts could open in the Alps and Pyrenees for the Christmas period - but that ski lifts would have to remain shut. Jean Castex said that mountain holidays were still a possibility, but that skiing was effectively ruled out. Hotels at resorts would be able to open when the country's national lockdown is lifted on 15 December, he said, while bars and restaurants will remain shut until January at the earliest. French President Emmanuel Macron said earlier this week thatFrance's ski resorts may have to remain closed until next yearbecause the current risks associated with the virus made it difficult for such sports to resume. He said he would discuss the issue with other European leaders and keep the decision under review. Ski resorts were responsible for numerous outbreaks of Covid-19 cases across Europe in the early days of the pandemic. Italy, Austria and Germany have all ordered lifts - even the high-altitude ones - at ski resorts to remain closed for the time being. But Switzerland is allowing ski resorts to remain open as long as they have strict safety measures in place, the health minister said today. David PittamBBC News Online Lia
Primrose (pictured left) is studying health and social care at college. The 17-year-old said: ""It
just feels like a bit of a kick in the teeth after cases went down so much. I work as a waitress so it'll affect me - I can't go back to work now. ""We
watched the announcement in class and he actually said tier two first, then said 'Oh sorry, tier three.' It was the biggest heartbreak. ""My age group is in a
weird place - we're at an age where we're expected to get Christmas presents for
people but we don't have the money because we can't work."" Her classmate, Poppi West, also 17, added:"" It's annoying that we keep going in and out - it feels like we're going round in circles. ""I know it's not the biggest issue but we're both nearly 18 and we won't be able to go out and have a drink to celebrate. It's just a bit sad."" Mass testing was piloted in Liverpool Liam Thorp of the Liverpool Echo asks whether Boris Johnson will increase funding for people who are self-isolating. He also notes that the city hasn't had the best relationship with the Conservatives in the past and asks the PM if he will remember Liverpool's efforts in the future when making funding decisions. ""What's happened in Liverpool has been fantastic,"" replies the prime minister. He says it is not just the testing programme but the way ""everyone pulled together to get the virus down"". ""We are going to keep supporting you throughout Covid and beyond,"" he promises. And that is the last question of today's press conference. Ben Glaze of the Daily Mirror asks if it is a good idea for people to be travelling across the country to hug and kiss elderly relatives. The PM says it has been an ""incredibly difficult decision"" as ministers have to balance people's strong desire to celebrate a family holiday - adding ""which frankly they're going do do anyway"" - and keeping the virus under control. He urges everyone to be ""commonsensical"" and ""do the right thing"". ""Until the vaccine comes on stream, we are not out of the woods yet and we have to be very, very vigilant,"" he adds. Prof Whitty says he would want people to see family, but adds: ""Would I encourage someone to hug and kiss elderly relatives? No, I would not."" He adds while it is not against the law, it does not make sense as you could be carrying the virus. ""The fact you can do something, doesn't mean you should."" Speaking of his own plans for Christmas, he says he will spend it on hospital wards. Sir Patrick Vallance says the key thing is to follow the basic rules of keeping distance where you can, keeping areas well-ventilated and so on. It will not be a normal Christmas and ""hugging elderly relatives is not something to do,"" he adds. They want to survive to be hugged again, adds Whitty.  This video can not be played Coronavirus: 'Take it really seriously during Christmas' Dominic Yeatman of the Metro asks if it is fair that pubs and restaurants forced to close will get support but the businesses that depend on them will not. He also asks if people will still stick to the rules if they believe the end of the virus is in sight. Boris Johnson says closed businesses do deserve protection and cites business grants and the furlough scheme as examples of government help. On the second question, Chris Whitty says he believes people will abide by the rules adding that the ""really heartening thing of this whole dreadful period"" has been the altruism, self-discipline and patience of the British public. ""You can always find some people who haven't followed the rules but they are in the minority,"" he says. Sky News's Beth Rigby asks about the loosening of restrictions over Christmas and whether a rise in cases is anticipated, leading to stricter rules before and afterwards. Prof Chris Whitty says Christmas will increase the risk: ""Everyone knows that, it's not a secret at all."" But it is not the only risk over this next period, he adds, with January and February the most difficult time for the NHS and a ""time of extreme pressure"". It is ""not the time of year where we want to be taking reckless decisions"" because ""things will be difficult for several months"", he adds. Christmas is an element of that but only one element. Christmas can be enjoyed without a spike in cases if people ""take it really seriously"" and ""don't do unnecessary things, just because you can"". People should ""take sensible precautions"", he adds. A number of Conservative MPs have lashed out at the introduction of new tiered Covid restrictions in England. The majority of the country will be placed in the two toughest levels when national lockdown ends on 2 December. The Covid Recovery Group, made up of Tory backbenchers, described the move as ""authoritarianism at work"". The group's deputy chair, Tory MP Steve Baker, called the announcement ""truly appalling"" and questioned if it was ""necessary and proportionate"" to the threat from coronavirus. The government has promised to publish an impact assessment early next week before MPs get a chance to vote on the new rules on Tuesday. But a revolt is brewing among the government's own MPs, including the chair of the influential 1922 committee of backbenchers, Sir Graham Brady. Read more. Military personnel helped at test sites in Liverpool Beth Rigby of Sky News asks how mass testing could be delivered to 40% of the population - asking if the whole British Army would have to be deployed. The PM replies he doesn't ""want to over-sell"" how easy it is to do it, and it ""depends on strong local leadership"" and ""real spirit"" in the local community. It is also ""only part of the panoply of interventions you need to defeat the disease"", he adds. The Army will help and support where necessary, but the key thing is local leaders saying they want the mass testing and the ""local will"" for it to be done. There will be ""adequate personnel"" and there are ""huge stocks"" of the lateral flow tests themselves right now, says Boris Johnson, adding there is hope they'll be made in the UK eventually.  ITV's Robert Peston asks the PM whether he will have to raise taxes and cut spending as a result of the pandemic. He also asks why the government's ""whack-a-mole"" strategy ""didn't work"". On the economy, Boris Johnson says his government is taking steps to ensure the country can ""bounce back from Covid"". ""It will need fiscal prudence - and that you will get from this government,"" he adds. On the lockdown strategy, Chris Whitty says, ""There are tiers that would work in the spring and summer which I would not expect to work at this stage."" Patrick Vallance says implementing weaker restrictions now would mean the government would have to resort to ""much more drastic measures"" later on. ""Madness is doing the same thing twice and expecting different results,"" Whitty adds. Chris MasonPolitical Correspondent The news conference can be summed up like this: the scientists say cases will rise in tier one, they'll hold steady in tier two and they'll fall under tier three. The prime minister wants to offer hope: ""Your tier is not your destiny,"" he says, and, ""By April things will genuinely be much, much better."" But, he adds, we must not ""take our foot off the throat of the beast now"". Boris Johnson knows there is a noisy collection of his own backbenchers who are spitting with anger over what the government's announced. And Labour are yet to commit to backing the government in next week's vote on this - they're expected to decide early next week once they have had the chance to speak to the government's experts. So this is Mr Johnson's case for why his plan is both necessary and, in his view, sensible. Laura Kuenssberg, political editor at BBC News, asks what the point of the national lockdown was if people are now moving to tougher restrictions. Boris Johnson replies it is ""very important"" for everyone to understand that ""this is not continuing the lockdown,"" with shops, hairdressers, gyms and places of worship among the venues reopening. ""This is a very different thing,"" he adds. ""What we have to do is keep eyes on the prize. In a few months we will have a vaccine, I'm absolutely convinced of it now. ""By April things will generally be much, much better."" He warns of relaxing too much now - taking our ""foot off the throat of the beast"" - when we are in a ""much better place"" than before the national lockdown. There are long months ahead but we are not abandoning the fight, he says. He stresses there is now option of mass testing, especially for tier-three communities ""who feel they have endured so much for so long"". Whitty is asked why more areas were not moved to tier three - and he replies that the government was keen to do enough to keep the R below one - but not to do anything unnecessary. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent It's clear the government now has greater confidence about the
impact the regional tiers will have. Research by the University of East Anglia
has shown that tier three is effective at suppressing the virus and tier two
stopped it from rising. Both of these tiers have been beefed up â in particular
around hospitality. The hope of government is that by going in hard and
placing nearly all of England in one of the top two tier, then in the coming
months areas will be able to drop down the tiers. The example of Liverpool is one that offers hope - it has
been placed in tier two, down from tier three before lockdown. The city used the new tool in the armoury â rapid mass
testing. The availability of these tests â which do not need to be
sent to the lab to be processed â is, ministers believe, a way of avoiding a
third lockdown and making progress during winter. Richard from Lancaster asks if the new vaccine will still work if Covid mutates. Patrick Vallance replies, ""This virus doesn't mutate as often as the flu virus but it does mutate."" He says none of the Covid mutations so far have changed in a way that would make the vaccines less effective but it is possible that future mutations might require new vaccines. He adds that making new vaccines would be possible, and points out this is what happens with flu vaccines every year. Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played Health Secretary Matt Hancock sets out England's new coronavirus tier system Most of England will be in the two toughest levels of measures when the national lockdown ends next week. The new coronavirus tier restrictions will mean 55 million people remain banned from mixing with other households indoors from 2 December. Large parts of the Midlands, North East and North West, including Manchester, as well as Kent, are in tier three. A majority of places are in the second highest level - tier two - including London, and Liverpool city region. The Isle of Wight, Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly - where there have been no recorded cases in the past week - will be the only areas of England in the lowest level of curbs - tier one. Tory revolt brewing over 'appalling' Covid tiers The system will be regularly reviewed, with the first scheduled for 16 December, so an area's tier level may change before Christmas. Prime Minister Boris Johnson told a Downing Street press conference thatthe tougher rules would ""strike a balance"",adding that ""every area has the means of escape"". What are the new rules? Check the new tier for your area Live updates as England's new tier arrangements confirmed Health Secretary Matt Hancock set out the reasoning behind the tier decisions for each areain a written ministerial statement,external. He told the Commons: ""Hope is on the horizon but we still have further to go. So we must all dig deep."" Mr Hancock added that people ""should see these restrictions not as a boundary to push but as a limit on what the public health advice says we can safely do in any area."" Around 23 million people across 21 local authority areas will be in the highest level - tier three - including Birmingham, Leeds, Sheffield, Tees Valley Combined Authority and North East Combined Authority. Lancashire, Leicester, Lincolnshire, Slough, Bristol, Kent and Medway will also be in tier three. Earlier, a rush for details of the tier allocations saw the government website repeatedly crash. On Thursday, another 498 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were reported in the UK, and a further 17,555 positive cases,the latest figures showed.,external Differences between the new tiers include restrictions on where households can meet up: tier one: the rule of six applies everywhere, indoors and out tier two: the rule of six applies outdoors but there is no household mixing anywhere indoors tier three: can only meet other households in outdoor public spaces like parks, where the rule of six applies Gyms and close-contact beauty services like hairdressers will be able to open in all tiers. Guidance said people in all tiers who can work from home, should continue to do so. Pubs in tier two can only open to serve ""substantial meals"", while those in tier three can only operate as a takeaway or delivery service. Hospitality bossessaid nearly nine in 10 venues believed they""are not viable to operate"" within tiers two and three. Make no mistake, this is only a gradual step out of lockdown. At the start of November nearly half the country was in tier one, meaning households could mix indoors in people's homes and in pubs and restaurants as long as they kept to the rule of six. Now that is only possible in Cornwall, the Isle of Wight and Isles of Scilly. Infection rates are showing early signs of coming down, but the government is erring on the side of caution. Research suggests they were too slow to put areas in higher tiers before lockdown. They do not want to make that mistake again - and so are starting off high in the hope they can move areas down the tiers. But it is not only about which area is in which tier. The top two tiers have been beefed up, particularly in regards to hospitality. One ray of hope, the government says, is the experience of Liverpool. Before lockdown it was in tier three and seeing among the highest infection rates in the country. Today it has now been put in tier two with infection levels pretty close to the national average. BBC analysis showed 713,573 people live in the new tier one areas, 32.2 million in tier two, and 23.3 million in tier three. This is compared to 23.5 million in tier one pre-lockdown, 24 million in tier two, and 8.7 million in tier three. The new tier restrictions will be voted on by MPs next week, with the government already facing opposition from its own backbenchers. Leading Conservative MP Sir Graham Brady told BBC Radio 4's World at One he would vote against the measures, saying: ""I do think that the policies have been far too authoritarian."" And former Brexit minister Steve Baker, deputy chairman of the recently-formed Covid Recovery Group (CRG), called for the government to publish analysis - ahead of the vote - of the impact restrictions were likely to have on controlling Covid, as well as the non-Covid health impact and the effect on ""society, people's livelihoods and businesses"". He said he was ""open"" to supporting measures ""where it can clearly be demonstrated that the government intervention will save more lives than it costs"". Meanwhile, there was a mixed reaction from regional leaders following the announcement of tier allocations. MPs and businesses in Cornwallexpressed ""huge relief""at being one of only three areas in England to be placed in tier one. Mayor of Liverpool Joe Anderson saidthe city region's move from tier three to tier twowas the result of ""hard work, dedication and sacrifice"". He said: ""We embraced tier three restrictions and worked fast to deliver the testing pilot, bringing in the Army to help us deliver an efficient service."" And Mayor of London Sadiq Khan saidthe decision to place the capital in the second highest level - tier two- was the result of people's ""monumental sacrifice"" and would be a ""welcome boost"" for businesses. This video can not be played Bar chain owner Martin Greenhow: ''This is pure and simple business torture"" But there wasanger among politicians in Lancashirethat the whole county had been placed into the highest tier of restrictions, after council leaders asked for it to be split into different tiers to reflect varying rates. Elsewhere, Leicester MPs and businesses said the city's tier three restrictions were ""extremely difficult to hear""following 150 days of lockdown. And Greater Manchester's mayor, Andy Burnham, said he hoped the regionwould be moved down from tier threein a couple of weeks. MASS TESTING:Where is it available? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? SCHOOLS:What will happen if children catch coronavirus? TESTING:How do I get a virus test? Decisions on tiers are based on public health recommendations informed by a series of public health data, including Covid-19 cases among the over-60s, positivity rates, pressure on the NHS and how quickly cases are rising or falling. Areas placed in tier three will be eligible for rapid or ""lateral flow"" tests - which give results in about 20 minutes without the need for a lab - to help bring down infections and reduce restrictions. And they will be offered support by NHS Test and Trace and the armed forces to deliver a six-week rapid community testing programme. Devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have the power to set their own coronavirus regulations, though all four UK nations have agreeda joint plan for Christmas. Earlier, data from the Office for National Statistics showed coronavirus infection rates in Englandwere continuing to show signs of levelling off.

Mr Hancock added that people ""should see these restrictions not as a boundary to push but as a limit on what the public health advice says we can safely do in any area."" Around 23 million people across 21 local authority areas will be in the highest level - tier three - including Birmingham, Leeds, Sheffield, Tees Valley Combined Authority and North East Combined Authority. Lancashire, Leicester, Lincolnshire, Slough, Bristol, Kent and Medway will also be in tier three. Earlier, a rush for details of the tier allocations saw the government website repeatedly crash. On Thursday, another 498 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were reported in the UK, and a further 17,555 positive cases,the latest figures showed.,external Differences between the new tiers include restrictions on where households can meet up: tier one: the rule of six applies everywhere, indoors and out tier two: the rule of six applies outdoors but there is no household mixing anywhere indoors tier three: can only meet other households in outdoor public spaces like parks, where the rule of six applies Gyms and close-contact beauty services like hairdressers will be able to open in all tiers. Guidance said people in all tiers who can work from home, should continue to do so. Pubs in tier two can only open to serve ""substantial meals"", while those in tier three can only operate as a takeaway or delivery service. Hospitality bossessaid nearly nine in 10 venues believed they""are not viable to operate"" within tiers two and three. Make no mistake, this is only a gradual step out of lockdown. At the start of November nearly half the country was in tier one, meaning households could mix indoors in people's homes and in pubs and restaurants as long as they kept to the rule of six. Now that is only possible in Cornwall, the Isle of Wight and Isles of Scilly. Infection rates are showing early signs of coming down, but the government is erring on the side of caution. Research suggests they were too slow to put areas in higher tiers before lockdown. They do not want to make that mistake again - and so are starting off high in the hope they can move areas down the tiers. But it is not only about which area is in which tier. The top two tiers have been beefed up, particularly in regards to hospitality. One ray of hope, the government says, is the experience of Liverpool. Before lockdown it was in tier three and seeing among the highest infection rates in the country. Today it has now been put in tier two with infection levels pretty close to the national average. BBC analysis showed 713,573 people live in the new tier one areas, 32.2 million in tier two, and 23.3 million in tier three. This is compared to 23.5 million in tier one pre-lockdown, 24 million in tier two, and 8.7 million in tier three. The new tier restrictions will be voted on by MPs next week, with the government already facing opposition from its own backbenchers. Leading Conservative MP Sir Graham Brady told BBC Radio 4's World at One he would vote against the measures, saying: ""I do think that the policies have been far too authoritarian."" And former Brexit minister Steve Baker, deputy chairman of the recently-formed Covid Recovery Group (CRG), called for the government to publish analysis - ahead of the vote - of the impact restrictions were likely to have on controlling Covid, as well as the non-Covid health impact and the effect on ""society, people's livelihoods and businesses"". He said he was ""open"" to supporting measures ""where it can clearly be demonstrated that the government intervention will save more lives than it costs"". Meanwhile, there was a mixed reaction from regional leaders following the announcement of tier allocations. MPs and businesses in Cornwallexpressed ""huge relief""at being one of only three areas in England to be placed in tier one. Mayor of Liverpool Joe Anderson saidthe city region's move from tier three to tier twowas the result of ""hard work, dedication and sacrifice"". He said: ""We embraced tier three restrictions and worked fast to deliver the testing pilot, bringing in the Army to help us deliver an efficient service."" And Mayor of London Sadiq Khan saidthe decision to place the capital in the second highest level - tier two- was the result of people's ""monumental sacrifice"" and would be a ""welcome boost"" for businesses. This video can not be played Bar chain owner Martin Greenhow: ''This is pure and simple business torture"" But there wasanger among politicians in Lancashirethat the whole county had been placed into the highest tier of restrictions, after council leaders asked for it to be split into different tiers to reflect varying rates. Elsewhere, Leicester MPs and businesses said the city's tier three restrictions were ""extremely difficult to hear""following 150 days of lockdown. And Greater Manchester's mayor, Andy Burnham, said he hoped the regionwould be moved down from tier threein a couple of weeks. MASS TESTING:Where is it available?

Areas placed in tier three will be eligible for rapid or ""lateral flow"" tests - which give results in about 20 minutes without the need for a lab - to help bring down infections and reduce restrictions. And they will be offered support by NHS Test and Trace and the armed forces to deliver a six-week rapid community testing programme.

"Tougher rules for England will ""strike a balance"" when the national lockdown ends next week, Boris Johnson has said. At a Downing Street briefing, the PM acknowledged that the stricter three-tiered system of regional measures to tackle coronavirus would bring ""heartbreak and frustration"". But he said ""your tier is not your destiny"" and stressed that ""every area has the means of escape"". Most of England will bein the toughest two levels of measuresfrom 2 December. The system will be reviewed every two weeks, with the first review scheduled for 16 December - so an area's tier level may change before Christmas. What are the new rules? Check the new tier for your area 'Don't hug elderly relatives at Christmas' Estonia and Latvia taken off travel corridor list However, it means 55 million people will remain banned from mixing with other households indoors after the lockdown ends. More than a third of England's population, including large parts of the Midlands, North East and North West, as well as Kent, will be in the highest level - tier three. And the majority of places are in the second highest level - tier two - including London, and Liverpool city region. The Isle of Wight, Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly - where there have been no recorded cases in the past week - will be the only areas of England in the lowest level of curbs - tier one. The new tier restrictions will be voted on by MPs next week, with arevolt already brewingamong the government's own backbenchers. Meanwhile, hospitality bosses have warnedthe sector will be ""decimated""by the new tiers. On Thursday, another 498 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were reported in the UK, and a further 17,555 positive cases,the latest figures showed.,external The prime minister warned that easing off risked ""losing control, casting aside our hard-won gains and forcing us back into a new year national lockdown"". He said there was ""no doubt the restrictions in all tiers are tough"" but admitted previous tiers ""were never quite enough"". The new approach was ""designed to reduce"" the R number - the average number of people an infected person will pass the disease on to - ""below one"", he added. Mr Johnson said mass community testing would be offered to tier three areas ""as quickly as possible"" and hailed Liverpool City region as a ""success story"", where mass testing had brought the area down to tier two. Move to tier 2 due to 'hard work and sacrifice' Mayor hopes 'to be out of tier 3 in two weeks' Anger as whole of Lancashire put into tier 3 'Huge relief' in Cornwall at tier 1 grading The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg asked the PM to clarify ""what was the point"" of the second national lockdown, if more people were facing tougher rules than before it began. Mr Johnson insisted this was ""not continuing the lockdown"". ""Across all tiers, shops will be open, hairdressers, personal services will be open, gyms will be functioning, places of worship will be open for communal worship as well, so this is a very different thing,"" he said. The PM added: ""And I'm convinced that by April things genuinely will be much, much better."" Some cold hard truths are emerging about the government's approach to controlling coronavirus. Much about today's announcement was familiar. A promise of hope on the horizon followed by a dose of reality about the spread of the virus and tough measures taken as a result. But months on from the arrival of Covid-19, the once solid political consensus over the response to the pandemic has worn thin. Now new measures are met with Conservative MPs up in arms and cutting criticism from the opposition. But wearily, reluctantly, the prime minister has clearly priced all that in and come to the view that tighter restrictions are needed for many more months before things can even begin to get back to something like normal. Meanwhile, the UK government's chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty and its chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance have warned against hugging and kissing elderly relatives this Christmas. Speaking at the news conference, Prof Whitty said people's behaviour at Christmas would ""matter a great deal"" this year. ""Would I encourage someone to hug and kiss elderly relatives? No, I would not,"" he said. ""It's not against the law. You can do it within the rules that are there, but it does not make sense because you could be carrying the virus."" Sir Patrick echoed his remarks, saying ""hugging elderly relatives is not something to go out and do"" over the festive season. Prof Whitty also said tier two would ""hold the line"" but not bring cases down - prompting scepticism from Conservative MP Mark Harper about the PM's claim that ""your tier is not your destiny"". Mr Harper, whose Forest of Dean constituency is in tier two, tweeted: ""Unfortunately, just after the PM said this, Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer, said tier two would only hold infections level, and tier one would see them go up. ""That rather suggests if you're in tier two, it is your destiny - at least until the spring."" MASS TESTING:Where is it available? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? SCHOOLS:What will happen if children catch coronavirus? TESTING:How do I get a virus test? Differences between the new tiers include restrictions on where households can meet up: tier one: the rule of six applies everywhere, indoors and out tier two: the rule of six applies outdoors but there is no household mixing anywhere indoors tier three: can only meet other households in outdoor public spaces like parks, where the rule of six applies Gyms and close-contact beauty services like hairdressers will be able to open in all tiers. People in all tiers who can work from home, should continue to do so. Pubs in tier two can only open to serve ""substantial meals"", while those in tier three can only operate as a takeaway or delivery service. Decisions on tiers are based on public health recommendations informed by a series of public health data, including Covid-19 cases among the over-60s, positivity rates, pressure on the NHS and how quickly cases are rising or falling. BBC analysis shows a north-south divide in England when it comes to restrictions: 75% of people in the the North (the North East, North West, Yorkshire and Humber) are in tier three, with 25% in tier two 73% of the Midlands (the East Midlands and West Midlands) are in tier three, 27% in tier three 10% of the south (the South West, South East, East and London) are in tier three, with 87% in tier two and 2.5% in tier one Devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have the power to set their own coronavirus regulations, though all four UK nations have agreeda joint plan for Christmas.

Danny AeberhardEurope regional editor, BBC World Service The Museum of London has launched an unusual project to capture how the coronavirus pandemic is affecting Londoners' lives - by collecting their dreams. The museum is working with researchers on dreams at a Canadian research institute. Sigmund Freud described dreams as the ""guardians of sleep"" - a description used as the name of the project, which the Museum of London says is the first of its kind. It seeks to document the effects of the pandemic on the subconscious of Londoners, as they work through some of the struggles and anxieties of the crisis in their sleep. The curator, Foteini Aravani, says people's testimonies will help to provide a more emotional and personal narrative for future generations. Just as many people might be feeling disappointed, frustrated and worried by the new tier system for England, so are MPs, with many in the House of Commons feeling the same way, says BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg. Some of the government's own Conservative MPs might even vote against the plan when it goes before them in the middle of next week. But ""while it might be bumpy"", there is ""not a realistic chance"" of it being blocked in any way. ""Like it or not, this is what is due to come in next Wednesday as the government tries to get control of this disease,"" she adds. Ski lifts stand idle at the resort of Les Menuires in the French Alps Would-be skiers in France have been left baffled after the prime minister said that winter resorts could open in the Alps and Pyrenees for the Christmas period - but that ski lifts would have to remain shut. Jean Castex said that mountain holidays were still a possibility, but that skiing was effectively ruled out. Hotels at resorts would be able to open when the country's national lockdown is lifted on 15 December, he said, while bars and restaurants will remain shut until January at the earliest. French President Emmanuel Macron said earlier this week thatFrance's ski resorts may have to remain closed until next yearbecause the current risks associated with the virus made it difficult for such sports to resume. He said he would discuss the issue with other European leaders and keep the decision under review. Ski resorts were responsible for numerous outbreaks of Covid-19 cases across Europe in the early days of the pandemic. Italy, Austria and Germany have all ordered lifts - even the high-altitude ones - at ski resorts to remain closed for the time being. But Switzerland is allowing ski resorts to remain open as long as they have strict safety measures in place, the health minister said today. David PittamBBC News Online Lia
Primrose (pictured left) is studying health and social care at college. The 17-year-old said: ""It
just feels like a bit of a kick in the teeth after cases went down so much. I work as a waitress so it'll affect me - I can't go back to work now. ""We
watched the announcement in class and he actually said tier two first, then said 'Oh sorry, tier three.' It was the biggest heartbreak. ""My age group is in a
weird place - we're at an age where we're expected to get Christmas presents for
people but we don't have the money because we can't work."" Her classmate, Poppi West, also 17, added:"" It's annoying that we keep going in and out - it feels like we're going round in circles. ""I know it's not the biggest issue but we're both nearly 18 and we won't be able to go out and have a drink to celebrate. It's just a bit sad."" Mass testing was piloted in Liverpool Liam Thorp of the Liverpool Echo asks whether Boris Johnson will increase funding for people who are self-isolating. He also notes that the city hasn't had the best relationship with the Conservatives in the past and asks the PM if he will remember Liverpool's efforts in the future when making funding decisions. ""What's happened in Liverpool has been fantastic,"" replies the prime minister. He says it is not just the testing programme but the way ""everyone pulled together to get the virus down"". ""We are going to keep supporting you throughout Covid and beyond,"" he promises. And that is the last question of today's press conference. Ben Glaze of the Daily Mirror asks if it is a good idea for people to be travelling across the country to hug and kiss elderly relatives. The PM says it has been an ""incredibly difficult decision"" as ministers have to balance people's strong desire to celebrate a family holiday - adding ""which frankly they're going do do anyway"" - and keeping the virus under control. He urges everyone to be ""commonsensical"" and ""do the right thing"". ""Until the vaccine comes on stream, we are not out of the woods yet and we have to be very, very vigilant,"" he adds. Prof Whitty says he would want people to see family, but adds: ""Would I encourage someone to hug and kiss elderly relatives? No, I would not."" He adds while it is not against the law, it does not make sense as you could be carrying the virus. ""The fact you can do something, doesn't mean you should."" Speaking of his own plans for Christmas, he says he will spend it on hospital wards. Sir Patrick Vallance says the key thing is to follow the basic rules of keeping distance where you can, keeping areas well-ventilated and so on. It will not be a normal Christmas and ""hugging elderly relatives is not something to do,"" he adds. They want to survive to be hugged again, adds Whitty.  This video can not be played Coronavirus: 'Take it really seriously during Christmas' Dominic Yeatman of the Metro asks if it is fair that pubs and restaurants forced to close will get support but the businesses that depend on them will not. He also asks if people will still stick to the rules if they believe the end of the virus is in sight. Boris Johnson says closed businesses do deserve protection and cites business grants and the furlough scheme as examples of government help. On the second question, Chris Whitty says he believes people will abide by the rules adding that the ""really heartening thing of this whole dreadful period"" has been the altruism, self-discipline and patience of the British public. ""You can always find some people who haven't followed the rules but they are in the minority,"" he says. Sky News's Beth Rigby asks about the loosening of restrictions over Christmas and whether a rise in cases is anticipated, leading to stricter rules before and afterwards. Prof Chris Whitty says Christmas will increase the risk: ""Everyone knows that, it's not a secret at all."" But it is not the only risk over this next period, he adds, with January and February the most difficult time for the NHS and a ""time of extreme pressure"". It is ""not the time of year where we want to be taking reckless decisions"" because ""things will be difficult for several months"", he adds. Christmas is an element of that but only one element. Christmas can be enjoyed without a spike in cases if people ""take it really seriously"" and ""don't do unnecessary things, just because you can"". People should ""take sensible precautions"", he adds. A number of Conservative MPs have lashed out at the introduction of new tiered Covid restrictions in England. The majority of the country will be placed in the two toughest levels when national lockdown ends on 2 December. The Covid Recovery Group, made up of Tory backbenchers, described the move as ""authoritarianism at work"". The group's deputy chair, Tory MP Steve Baker, called the announcement ""truly appalling"" and questioned if it was ""necessary and proportionate"" to the threat from coronavirus. The government has promised to publish an impact assessment early next week before MPs get a chance to vote on the new rules on Tuesday. But a revolt is brewing among the government's own MPs, including the chair of the influential 1922 committee of backbenchers, Sir Graham Brady. Read more. Military personnel helped at test sites in Liverpool Beth Rigby of Sky News asks how mass testing could be delivered to 40% of the population - asking if the whole British Army would have to be deployed. The PM replies he doesn't ""want to over-sell"" how easy it is to do it, and it ""depends on strong local leadership"" and ""real spirit"" in the local community. It is also ""only part of the panoply of interventions you need to defeat the disease"", he adds. The Army will help and support where necessary, but the key thing is local leaders saying they want the mass testing and the ""local will"" for it to be done. There will be ""adequate personnel"" and there are ""huge stocks"" of the lateral flow tests themselves right now, says Boris Johnson, adding there is hope they'll be made in the UK eventually.  ITV's Robert Peston asks the PM whether he will have to raise taxes and cut spending as a result of the pandemic. He also asks why the government's ""whack-a-mole"" strategy ""didn't work"". On the economy, Boris Johnson says his government is taking steps to ensure the country can ""bounce back from Covid"". ""It will need fiscal prudence - and that you will get from this government,"" he adds. On the lockdown strategy, Chris Whitty says, ""There are tiers that would work in the spring and summer which I would not expect to work at this stage."" Patrick Vallance says implementing weaker restrictions now would mean the government would have to resort to ""much more drastic measures"" later on. ""Madness is doing the same thing twice and expecting different results,"" Whitty adds. Chris MasonPolitical Correspondent The news conference can be summed up like this: the scientists say cases will rise in tier one, they'll hold steady in tier two and they'll fall under tier three. The prime minister wants to offer hope: ""Your tier is not your destiny,"" he says, and, ""By April things will genuinely be much, much better."" But, he adds, we must not ""take our foot off the throat of the beast now"". Boris Johnson knows there is a noisy collection of his own backbenchers who are spitting with anger over what the government's announced. And Labour are yet to commit to backing the government in next week's vote on this - they're expected to decide early next week once they have had the chance to speak to the government's experts. So this is Mr Johnson's case for why his plan is both necessary and, in his view, sensible. Laura Kuenssberg, political editor at BBC News, asks what the point of the national lockdown was if people are now moving to tougher restrictions. Boris Johnson replies it is ""very important"" for everyone to understand that ""this is not continuing the lockdown,"" with shops, hairdressers, gyms and places of worship among the venues reopening. ""This is a very different thing,"" he adds. ""What we have to do is keep eyes on the prize. In a few months we will have a vaccine, I'm absolutely convinced of it now. ""By April things will generally be much, much better."" He warns of relaxing too much now - taking our ""foot off the throat of the beast"" - when we are in a ""much better place"" than before the national lockdown. There are long months ahead but we are not abandoning the fight, he says. He stresses there is now option of mass testing, especially for tier-three communities ""who feel they have endured so much for so long"". Whitty is asked why more areas were not moved to tier three - and he replies that the government was keen to do enough to keep the R below one - but not to do anything unnecessary. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent It's clear the government now has greater confidence about the
impact the regional tiers will have. Research by the University of East Anglia
has shown that tier three is effective at suppressing the virus and tier two
stopped it from rising. Both of these tiers have been beefed up â in particular
around hospitality. The hope of government is that by going in hard and
placing nearly all of England in one of the top two tier, then in the coming
months areas will be able to drop down the tiers. The example of Liverpool is one that offers hope - it has
been placed in tier two, down from tier three before lockdown. The city used the new tool in the armoury â rapid mass
testing. The availability of these tests â which do not need to be
sent to the lab to be processed â is, ministers believe, a way of avoiding a
third lockdown and making progress during winter. Richard from Lancaster asks if the new vaccine will still work if Covid mutates. Patrick Vallance replies, ""This virus doesn't mutate as often as the flu virus but it does mutate."" He says none of the Covid mutations so far have changed in a way that would make the vaccines less effective but it is possible that future mutations might require new vaccines. He adds that making new vaccines would be possible, and points out this is what happens with flu vaccines every year. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Boris Johnson has appointed an ex-Treasury official as his new chief of staff, Downing Street has announced. Dan Rosenfield's appointment follows a period of upheaval which saw the prime minister's senior aides Dominic Cummings and Lee Cain resign. Mr Rosenfield is former civil servant, who has worked in the past for Labour chancellor Alistair Darling and his Tory successor George Osborne. He will begin work at Downing Street on 7 December. The current acting chief of staff Lord Udny-Lister will stay in the role until 1 January when Mr Rosenfield will take over. Cleo Watson, one of the PM's deputy chiefs of staff, who was close to Mr Cummings, is also leaving No 10. Dominic Cummings leaves No 10 'to clear the air' Mr Rosenfield joins No 10 from Hakluyt, a strategic advisory firm. He has also previously worked at Bank of America as a managing director and is chairman of the humanitarian agency World Jewish Relief. The chief of staff role had originally been offered to Mr Cain, however some MPs and ministers objected to the appointment. And following a power struggle inside No 10 both Mr Cain and his ally Mr Cummings stepped down from their roles. This senior job hasn't gone to a high-profile name from Tory ranks as some expected, but a former civil servant. While he has worked at the heart of government in his role at the Treasury, he is a relative outsider in current political circles. Those who know Dan Rosenfield describe him as likeable, clever and effective. One former Treasury colleague said he was ordered and efficient. ""If the wheels are coming off he'll want to try to put them back on"", they added. Having been in the private sector in recent years, he's not thought to be attached to any particular faction in No 10; perhaps that was part of the thinking behind his appointment. After the recent turbulence that saw the departure of two of Boris Johnson's closest aides, Downing Street will want to avoid any further internal division. Many have called for a ""reset moment"". The prime minister may well hope this pick for chief of staff is part of that. Mr Rosenfield grew up in what he describes as a ""small Jewish community"" in Manchester. In an interview last year with the Jewish Telegraph,,externalMr Rosenfield describes Judaism as being ""pretty central"" to his life and says his local synagogue was his ""second home"". He also recalls working in the Treasury during the 2008 financial crisis. ""It became very clear that we were dealing with some quite fundamentally difficult challenges,"" he said. Speaking at a World Jewish Relief dinner in 2017 he said he was driven by the principle of ""the rejection of tragedy in the name of hope"". Dan Rosenfield (left) was an official at the Treasury when it was run by George Osborne Welcoming the appointment, ex-Treasury Minister David Gauke described Mr Rosenfield as ""smart, likeable and effective"". And a former Labour adviser Damian McBride said the PM's new recruit had ""a first-class brain and an easy smile"". His previous employers Hakluyt are a low-profile consultancy firm with offices in Mayfair, central London, as well as New York, Mumbai, Singapore, and Tokyo. The company says it is named after the English writer Richard Hakluyt ""because his role in advancing knowledge of the wider world in the 16th and 17th centuries... reflects the firm's global interests and independence of thought"". It is chaired by the Conservative peer Lord Deighton - who was recently given a role co-ordinating the drive to scale up UK manufacturing of personal protective equipment (PPE).

"Campaigner Sarian Kamara says many women are still too scared to come forward It is feared victims of female genital mutilation in England are not reporting cases because of delays and lockdown closures, charities have told the BBC. It comes asnew figures revealed,external635 new cases were recorded from July-September - a fall of more than a third compared with the same period in 2019. The Home Office and NHS England said clinics remained open - but victims have reported treatment delays. Campaigners fear the lower figures could lead to future funding cuts. FGM is illegal in the UK and it is compulsory for family doctors, hospitals and mental health trusts to report any new cases in their patients. The practice - intentionally altering or injuring the female external genitalia for non-medical reasons - carries a sentence of up to 14 years in prison. Women in England over the age of 18 are directed to specialist FGM clinics to receive care. In 2019, the eight clinics were given funding for two years to provide specialised FGM services in London, Bristol, Leeds and Birmingham. The Home Office and NHS England told the BBC that the clinics have remained open during the pandemic and provide virtual consultations to keep services operating. FGM clinics open across England to support victims What is FGM, where does it happen and why? But women say the Covid-19 pandemic has made it harder to access services. One, who needs a physical examination, told the BBC: ""There is so much frustration. My name is on the waiting list to go and see the doctors at the clinic. But I can't [go]."" She says she is only comfortable visiting a specialist doctor, which is why she is reliant on the clinic seeing her. Another woman, who has been supported by anti-FGM charity the Vavengers, was due to have a procedure in March, but it was delayed until October. She was twice sent away from hospital because the defibulation operation was not deemed essential. During the pandemic, the number of new women being recorded in the system has fallen to the lowest since records began in 2015 - 630 new cases in April-June and 635 in July-September. But experts say the number of women living with FGM is far higher than the official figures suggest. ""Many are asylum seekers or refugees and are scared they are going to be picked up if they go to hospital,"" says Sarian Kamara, an anti-FGM campaigner. ""We are trying to get them out of hiding."" Charities say they are concerned that falls during the pandemic could also affect the future of the eight specialised FGM clinics. They were established on two-year contracts, funded by NHS England and the government. But beyond 2021, they will need to be commissioned by local authorities. Janet Fyle, midwifery advisor at the Royal College of Midwives, said: ""They are reporting what is reported to them - that doesn't mean we've got less women with FGM. At Imperial, 10% of pregnant woman annually have FGM. That's 600 out of 6,000 women."" However, Nimco Ali, FGM advisor to the government, said the recent NHS figures are a sign of the government's success. ""The reality is almost all women have now been asked the question [if they have been victims of FGM], now we have the data, so we should move towards providing provisions for the number of women rather than hyping it up as the same issue we had 10 years ago."" In a statement, the Home Office said it had recently awarded funding to ""a number of charities working to support victims of so-called honour-based abuse, such as FGM, in order to address the challenges posed by the coronavirus pandemic"".

"The marble fragment is believed to have been taken from the Roman Forum A repentant American tourist has returned a block of ancient marble stolen during a trip to Rome. The fragment was delivered to Italy's National Roman Museum, with ""To Sam, love Jess, Rome 2017"" inscribed on it. In an accompanying note, the pilfering traveller begged forgiveness for having been ""inconsiderate and disrespectful"". ""I feel terribly for not only taking this item from its rightful place, but also placing writing on it as well,"" they said.

"Yahya Werfalli admitted two counts of fraud by false representation Manchester Magistrates' Court last month A friend of the Manchester Arena bomber whose bank details were used to buy chemicals for the bomb has been handed a 12-month community order. Manchester Crown Court heard Yahya Werfalli's bank details were used to buy hydrogen peroxide on Amazon. The chemical was acquired by brothers Salman and Hashem Abedi for the bomb that killed 22 people in May 2017. Judge Patrick Field QC told the court Werfalli ""had no idea what the Abedi brothers were up to"". He said the defendant - who had engaged in other frauds in the past - would have been charged with a more serious offence had his own activity with the Abedis involved more than fraud. Werfalli, a university student from Buckingham,admitted two counts of fraud by false representationlast month. Families of some of those killed in the attack were present in court to see Werfalli sentenced. ""I am not blind to the terrible events that unfolded at the arena,"" said the judge, who explained: ""I must not let the inevitable emotional response to that influence the sentence in this case."" He said Werfalli, who lived in Manchester at the time of the frauds, must complete 80 hours of unpaid work and 20 days of ""rehabilitation requirement"". Prosecutor Harriet Lavin said the case concerned bank frauds in March and April 2017 in which the defendant planned with Salman and Hashem Abedi for them to order products online using his bank details. In order to obtain refunds, he then planned to falsely claim to his bank, RBS, that he had not made the purchases. The court was told the Abedi brothers put Â£300 into the defendant's bank account and the pair placed orders on Amazon using an account they had set up using Werfalli's card details. Ms Lavin said: ""Once the order had been delivered, the defendant then contacted his bank and reported the purchase as fraudulent. ""It was anticipated that the bank would then refund the money with little scrutiny as it would have been a low value amount. ""Salman and Hashem Abedi would thereby get the products they wanted with no trace back to themselves."" Yahya Werfalli was a ""dupe"" who had been ""exploited by the terrorists,"" court hears The court heard the hydrogen peroxide was ""used by the pair to construct the bomb that killed 22 people and seriously injured many more"". Ms Lavin said: ""There is no evidence to suggest this defendant had any knowledge of the nature of the goods being purchased, or their intended purpose."" She said the goods were delivered to an address unconnected to the defendant and there was nothing on his phone to suggest he was in contact with Salman or Hashem Abedi around the time of the attack. The court heard that, after being arrested following the attack, Werfalli described two meetings with the Abedi brothers in which plans for a fraud were discussed. Anthony Barraclough, defending, said his client was a ""dupe"" who had been ""exploited by the terrorists"". Why not follow BBC North West onFacebook,external,Twitter,externalandInstagram,external?

"Coronavirus infection rates in England are continuing to show signs of levelling off - but the picture across the UK is mixed, according to data from theOffice for National Statistics,external. In Wales and Northern Ireland, infections have been decreasing in recent weeks - but in Scotland, they seem to be rising. After lockdown ends in England, most areas face tougher tier restrictions. Most will be in tier two - high alert, including London and Liverpool. In Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland the devolved administrations have the power to set their own coronavirus regulations, thoughall four UK nations have agreed a joint plan for Christmas. In England, decisions on post-lockdown tiers are based on how fast case rates are falling or rising in different areas, as well as numbers affected in the over-60s. With the second lockdown having started on 5 November, Prof Kevin McConway, statistics expert from the Open University, says it might seem disappointing that progress to reduce infections hadn't been faster. ""People continue to give positive test results, on average, for at least 10 days after they were first infected, so some of the people who tested positive in the most recent week would have been infected before the English lockdown began,"" he said. The ONS figures are based on thousands of people tested for the virus in households across the UK, whether they have symptoms or not. Of those tested in the week to 21 November, one person tested positive out of every: 85 in England 115 in Scotland 145 in Northern Ireland 185 in Wales How many confirmed cases are in your area? What are the new rules in England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales? According to the ONS estimates, rates in England increased in the East Midlands and North East that week, while continuing to fall in the North West. In the east of England, London, the South East and South West, rates now appear to be decreasing too. The areas with the highest number of people infected per head of population are Yorkshire and the Humber, the North West and North East. Secondary-school-age children and young adults are seeing the highest infection rates. This information is based on a relatively small number of people testing positive in each age group and region, so there is a wide margin for error. LOCKDOWN LOOK-UP:The rules in your area THREE TIERS:How will the system work? TESTING:How do I get a virus test? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters LOCAL LOCKDOWNS:What happens if you have one? TEST AND TRACE:How does it work? In Scotland, an estimated 45,700 people had the virus in the week to 21 November - one person in every 115, up from one in 155 the previous week. But the ONS says the results are based on modelling and ""should be interpreted with caution"". The ONS figures are one source of data which helps the government's scientific advisers estimate the reproduction (R) number of the virus every week. Another source isthe Covid symptom study app,external, which suggests there has been a fall in new UK daily symptomatic cases - from 34,279 to 29,311 - over the two weeks up to 22 November. This estimate is based on one million people using the app every week. Data from Public Health England shows rates of coronavirus cases are still rising in 45% of areas (shown as pink, red or dark red in the map), despite the second lockdown. However Dr Yvonne Doyle, PHE medical director, says ""there is now reason for hope"". ""Case rates have fallen across every age range and in all regions, and positivity in both pillars [NHS and community testing] has also decreased. Over time we can expect that to lead to fewer hospitalisations and deaths. ""The huge efforts people have made over the past few weeks are starting to pay off,"" Dr Doyle said. The government's daily figures for confirmed UK cases of coronavirus are often much lower than the ONS numbers because they only count people with symptoms testing positive. On Thursday, the government reported that17,555 people tested positive and 498 people had died,externalwithin 28 days of a positive test. Over the past week, that's a 25% reduction in cases. The number of patients admitted to hospital is also falling - but deaths continue to rise.

"Coronavirus infection rates in England are continuing to show signs of levelling off - but the picture across the UK is mixed, according to data from theOffice for National Statistics,external. In Wales and Northern Ireland, infections have been decreasing in recent weeks - but in Scotland, they seem to be rising. After lockdown ends in England, most areas face tougher tier restrictions. Most will be in tier two - high alert, including London and Liverpool. In Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland the devolved administrations have the power to set their own coronavirus regulations, thoughall four UK nations have agreed a joint plan for Christmas. In England, decisions on post-lockdown tiers are based on how fast case rates are falling or rising in different areas, as well as numbers affected in the over-60s. With the second lockdown having started on 5 November, Prof Kevin McConway, statistics expert from the Open University, says it might seem disappointing that progress to reduce infections hadn't been faster. ""People continue to give positive test results, on average, for at least 10 days after they were first infected, so some of the people who tested positive in the most recent week would have been infected before the English lockdown began,"" he said. The ONS figures are based on thousands of people tested for the virus in households across the UK, whether they have symptoms or not. Of those tested in the week to 21 November, one person tested positive out of every: 85 in England 115 in Scotland 145 in Northern Ireland 185 in Wales How many confirmed cases are in your area? What are the new rules in England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales? According to the ONS estimates, rates in England increased in the East Midlands and North East that week, while continuing to fall in the North West. In the east of England, London, the South East and South West, rates now appear to be decreasing too. The areas with the highest number of people infected per head of population are Yorkshire and the Humber, the North West and North East. Secondary-school-age children and young adults are seeing the highest infection rates. This information is based on a relatively small number of people testing positive in each age group and region, so there is a wide margin for error. LOCKDOWN LOOK-UP:The rules in your area THREE TIERS:How will the system work? TESTING:How do I get a virus test? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters LOCAL LOCKDOWNS:What happens if you have one? TEST AND TRACE:How does it work? In Scotland, an estimated 45,700 people had the virus in the week to 21 November - one person in every 115, up from one in 155 the previous week. But the ONS says the results are based on modelling and ""should be interpreted with caution"". The ONS figures are one source of data which helps the government's scientific advisers estimate the reproduction (R) number of the virus every week. Another source isthe Covid symptom study app,external, which suggests there has been a fall in new UK daily symptomatic cases - from 34,279 to 29,311 - over the two weeks up to 22 November. This estimate is based on one million people using the app every week. Data from Public Health England shows rates of coronavirus cases are still rising in 45% of areas (shown as pink, red or dark red in the map), despite the second lockdown. However Dr Yvonne Doyle, PHE medical director, says ""there is now reason for hope"". ""Case rates have fallen across every age range and in all regions, and positivity in both pillars [NHS and community testing] has also decreased. Over time we can expect that to lead to fewer hospitalisations and deaths. ""The huge efforts people have made over the past few weeks are starting to pay off,"" Dr Doyle said. The government's daily figures for confirmed UK cases of coronavirus are often much lower than the ONS numbers because they only count people with symptoms testing positive. On Thursday, the government reported that17,555 people tested positive and 498 people had died,externalwithin 28 days of a positive test. Over the past week, that's a 25% reduction in cases. The number of patients admitted to hospital is also falling - but deaths continue to rise.

"PC Simon Read was found to have intentionally scanned the wrong barcode A police officer accused of trying to buy a Â£9.95 box of doughnuts for seven pence by sticking on a cheaper barcode has been sacked for gross misconduct. PC Simon Read, from Cambridgeshire Police, was found to have switched the price for the cakes at a Wisbech supermarket on 10 February. A misconduct hearing found he had breached professional standards of honesty and integrity. PC Read, who had denied the charges, was dismissed without notice. PC Read had previously worked at several royal weddings and a visit to Blenheim Palace by Donald Trump At the two-day hearing in Peterborough PC Read said he had made an honest mistake at a Tesco Extra self-service till. While in uniform, he said he purchased four items from the store - the tray of 12 doughnuts, the carrots, a sandwich and a drink. The hearing was told he scanned the carrots barcode twice and failed to scan the doughnuts barcode, paying around Â£4 for the items instead of about Â£14. He said: ""I simply scanned where I believed the barcodes were and placed them down (in the bagging area)."" The panel ruled his explanation was ""lacking in credibility"". A manager at Tesco Extra reported his ""suspicious"" actions to the police Sharmistha Michaels, chairwoman of the disciplinary panel, said: ""On the balance of probabilities we are satisfied that PC Read did intentionally scan the wrong barcode."" PC Read had previously said: ""I didn't check the screen. I wish I had have done."" Ms Michaels said CCTV footage showed him looking at it at the time as he selected his method of payment. She added that if he intended to pay the correct price he could have checked that he scanned the right barcode and it if was a ""genuine mistake"" he had opportunities to put it right. His actions were ""incompatible with his role as a police officer"". Mark Ley-Morgan, a lawyer who set out the misconduct case, said it was ""an officer effectively stealing while in uniform"". Carolina Bracken, PC Read's lawyer, said he had an ""unblemished career"", had served in the armed forces, before he joined Cambridgeshire police in January and had served with Thames Valley Police from 2008. Ms Bracken said the case weighed heavily on him and he had received prank calls in the night from people offering him doughnuts. PC Read has the right to appeal the decision. After the ruling the Jane Gyford, deputy Chief Constable of Cambridgeshire Police, said: ""The public should be able to trust that police officers in their duty will act with honesty and integrity at all times. ""I hope this outcome offers reassurance to our communities that our officers and staff will be held to account for their actions.""

"Tougher rules for England will ""strike a balance"" when the national lockdown ends next week, Boris Johnson has said. At a Downing Street briefing, the PM acknowledged that the stricter three-tiered system of regional measures to tackle coronavirus would bring ""heartbreak and frustration"". But he said ""your tier is not your destiny"" and stressed that ""every area has the means of escape"". Most of England will bein the toughest two levels of measuresfrom 2 December. The system will be reviewed every two weeks, with the first review scheduled for 16 December - so an area's tier level may change before Christmas. What are the new rules? Check the new tier for your area 'Don't hug elderly relatives at Christmas' Estonia and Latvia taken off travel corridor list However, it means 55 million people will remain banned from mixing with other households indoors after the lockdown ends. More than a third of England's population, including large parts of the Midlands, North East and North West, as well as Kent, will be in the highest level - tier three. And the majority of places are in the second highest level - tier two - including London, and Liverpool city region. The Isle of Wight, Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly - where there have been no recorded cases in the past week - will be the only areas of England in the lowest level of curbs - tier one. The new tier restrictions will be voted on by MPs next week, with arevolt already brewingamong the government's own backbenchers. Meanwhile, hospitality bosses have warnedthe sector will be ""decimated""by the new tiers. On Thursday, another 498 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were reported in the UK, and a further 17,555 positive cases,the latest figures showed.,external The prime minister warned that easing off risked ""losing control, casting aside our hard-won gains and forcing us back into a new year national lockdown"". He said there was ""no doubt the restrictions in all tiers are tough"" but admitted previous tiers ""were never quite enough"". The new approach was ""designed to reduce"" the R number - the average number of people an infected person will pass the disease on to - ""below one"", he added. Mr Johnson said mass community testing would be offered to tier three areas ""as quickly as possible"" and hailed Liverpool City region as a ""success story"", where mass testing had brought the area down to tier two. Move to tier 2 due to 'hard work and sacrifice' Mayor hopes 'to be out of tier 3 in two weeks' Anger as whole of Lancashire put into tier 3 'Huge relief' in Cornwall at tier 1 grading The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg asked the PM to clarify ""what was the point"" of the second national lockdown, if more people were facing tougher rules than before it began. Mr Johnson insisted this was ""not continuing the lockdown"". ""Across all tiers, shops will be open, hairdressers, personal services will be open, gyms will be functioning, places of worship will be open for communal worship as well, so this is a very different thing,"" he said. The PM added: ""And I'm convinced that by April things genuinely will be much, much better."" Some cold hard truths are emerging about the government's approach to controlling coronavirus. Much about today's announcement was familiar. A promise of hope on the horizon followed by a dose of reality about the spread of the virus and tough measures taken as a result. But months on from the arrival of Covid-19, the once solid political consensus over the response to the pandemic has worn thin. Now new measures are met with Conservative MPs up in arms and cutting criticism from the opposition. But wearily, reluctantly, the prime minister has clearly priced all that in and come to the view that tighter restrictions are needed for many more months before things can even begin to get back to something like normal. Meanwhile, the UK government's chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty and its chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance have warned against hugging and kissing elderly relatives this Christmas. Speaking at the news conference, Prof Whitty said people's behaviour at Christmas would ""matter a great deal"" this year. ""Would I encourage someone to hug and kiss elderly relatives? No, I would not,"" he said. ""It's not against the law. You can do it within the rules that are there, but it does not make sense because you could be carrying the virus."" Sir Patrick echoed his remarks, saying ""hugging elderly relatives is not something to go out and do"" over the festive season. Prof Whitty also said tier two would ""hold the line"" but not bring cases down - prompting scepticism from Conservative MP Mark Harper about the PM's claim that ""your tier is not your destiny"". Mr Harper, whose Forest of Dean constituency is in tier two, tweeted: ""Unfortunately, just after the PM said this, Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer, said tier two would only hold infections level, and tier one would see them go up. ""That rather suggests if you're in tier two, it is your destiny - at least until the spring."" MASS TESTING:Where is it available? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? SCHOOLS:What will happen if children catch coronavirus? TESTING:How do I get a virus test? Differences between the new tiers include restrictions on where households can meet up: tier one: the rule of six applies everywhere, indoors and out tier two: the rule of six applies outdoors but there is no household mixing anywhere indoors tier three: can only meet other households in outdoor public spaces like parks, where the rule of six applies Gyms and close-contact beauty services like hairdressers will be able to open in all tiers. People in all tiers who can work from home, should continue to do so. Pubs in tier two can only open to serve ""substantial meals"", while those in tier three can only operate as a takeaway or delivery service. Decisions on tiers are based on public health recommendations informed by a series of public health data, including Covid-19 cases among the over-60s, positivity rates, pressure on the NHS and how quickly cases are rising or falling. BBC analysis shows a north-south divide in England when it comes to restrictions: 75% of people in the the North (the North East, North West, Yorkshire and Humber) are in tier three, with 25% in tier two 73% of the Midlands (the East Midlands and West Midlands) are in tier three, 27% in tier three 10% of the south (the South West, South East, East and London) are in tier three, with 87% in tier two and 2.5% in tier one Devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have the power to set their own coronavirus regulations, though all four UK nations have agreeda joint plan for Christmas. Earlier, data from the Office for National Statistics showed coronavirus infection rates in Englandwere continuing to show signs of levelling off.

Elizabeth Dixon, from Hampshire, died due to a blocked breathing tube shortly before her first birthday. The government, which ordered the inquiry in 2017, said the mistakes in her care were ""shocking and harrowing"".

"The government has announced the end of all legal Covid restrictions in England, and Scotland has taken similar steps. Here are some of your questions on the changes: Because your son is in a clinical risk group - and as long as he is over five - he shouldsoon be offered two doses of the Pfizer vaccine. You should be contacted by your GP or specialist team to arrange this. With regard to the dangers of mixing, the UK has also recommended that Covid vaccines are offered to all children aged 5 to 11, not just those at high clinical risk. This is likely to start in England in April. Children are generally at much lower risk of becoming seriously ill from a Covid infection, although some do still get sick and need hospital care. Over-12s can already be vaccinated, and it's hoped that extending the rollout to younger age groups will help protect even more children from the risk of catching and spreading Covid. Schools are expected to work with and support families who have concerns about a pupil returning to the classroom. It is compulsory for school-age children to attend, even if they were previously shielding - the only exception is a small number of children whose clinician or GP has advised them not to attend. If you have concerns about this, you should talk to your doctor. If you live in England and are not in a vulnerable group yourself, it is unlikely that you will be entitled to a free test after 1 April. From that point, lateral flow tests should be available to buy from pharmacies and other retailers. The government says it will continue to provide free tests to the oldest age groups and those most vulnerable to Covid. We don't have the details of how this will work yet, but your mother and her care workers should still be eligible for free tests. Care homes are responsible for their own visiting policies, but at the moment across the UK, all visitors are expected to test for Covid before arrival. The chief scientific adviser Patrick Vallance has warned that further variants of Covid are expected - and that they could be more severe than previous ones. Therefore, although most of the free testing system is being dismantled in England, the government insists that the UK will continue to do detailed checks and surveillance to look for resurgences of Covid and any concerning new variants which may emerge. For example, some people in the community will still be asked to do regular tests for Covid as part of theOffice for National Statisticsâ Infection Survey. Positive test results collected this way can be analysed to identify the type of Covid people have. Throughout the pandemic, scientists have learned a great deal about how to track the virus, and the government says it will be possible to scale up such operations again in the future if necessary. Trials are already underway to test updated vaccines that could be a better match for the virus as it continues to change. The UK government also says it will also help support other countries in developing their own surveillance capabilities, because a new variant can emerge anywhere. NHS England says patients and staff should continue to wear face masks in GP practiceseven though they are no longer mandatory in public places. Face coverings also remain compulsory in healthcare settings in Scotland and Wales, and it is ""strongly advised"" that people wear them in Northern Ireland. Your doctor will be able to advise about what tests you will need before you have an operation. You may need to have a Covid test, and the government has said free testing will still be available in certain settings, such as hospitals. Infection control measures will continue to help keep people safe and limit the spread of the virus. SYMPTOMS:How do I know I've got Covid?

"Most of England is expected to be placed in the two toughest tiers of coronavirus restrictions when the national lockdown ends next Wednesday. Health Secretary Matt Hancock will set out the plans in the Commons later. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said she understood only a ""handful"" of areas would have the lowest level of restrictions, tier one. Most areas, including London, would be in tier two with ""significant numbers"" in tier three - the highest level. Differences between the tiers include limits on where households can meet up - for instance, in the new tier one, the rule of six applies indoors and out. In tier two, the rule of six remains outdoors but there is no household mixing indoors. Chancellor Rishi Sunak told BBC Breakfast the new tiers represent a ""tangible change compared to the last four weeks"" of lockdown in England. ""There are significant differences to that - more of our life can resume, more of our economic activity can resume,"" he said. The system will be regularly reviewed and an area's tier level may change before Christmas - the first review is scheduled for 16 December. Decisions on tiers are based on public health recommendations informed by the following factors: Case detection rate - in all age groups and, in particular, the over-60s How quickly case rates are rising or falling Positivity in the general population Pressure on the NHS - including current and projected NHS capacity Local context and exceptional circumstances, such as a local but contained outbreak An area could be moved up a tier if these indicators are not improving, and likewise down to a lower one if they improve. Mr Sunak said a meeting of the Cabinet would consider the new tiers on Thursday morning, before Mr Hancock addresses the Commons. The final decisions will be made by Prime Minister Boris Johnson, the government said. He will lead a Downing Street news conference later. The new system will be stricter than the previous one and more local authorities will be in higher tiers. Mr Hancock has urged people to follow the rules so ""together we can get out of these tough measures"". ""I know for those of you faced with tier three restrictions this will be a particularly difficult time but I want to reassure you that we'll be supporting your areas with mass community testing and extra funding,"" he said. LIVE: England braced for pre-Christmas tier decision What will the new rules be? Tiers and Christmas: A recipe for disaster? Areas placed in tier three will be eligible for rapid or ""lateral flow"" tests - which give results in about 20 minutes without the need for a lab - to help bring down infections and reduce restrictions. And they will be offered support by NHS Test and Trace and the armed forces to deliver a six-week rapid community testing programme. Tier allocations will be reviewed for the first time by 16 December, allowing for ""the possibility of areas which continue to make progress in slowing the spread of the disease"" to be moved down a tier before Christmas, the government said. On Wednesday, the government recorded another 696 UK deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test, the highest daily figure reported since 5 May. Total deaths now stand at 56,533. A further 18,213 lab-confirmed cases of coronavirus were also reported. It is clear the government is taking a tougher approach to regional tiers post lockdown. Not only has it beefed up the system - the top two tiers in particular have stricter rules for hospitality - but very few local authority areas will end up in the bottom tier with the most relaxed restrictions. By the time England went into lockdown 170 local authority areas - well over half - were still in tier one, meaning mixing indoors was allowed. Very few will start there this time. That's because an analysis by the University of East Anglia found the bottom tier was not effective at suppressing the virus. But it did find the top two tiers had an impact. One of the problems, it said, was that the government was too slow to move areas up a tier when infection rates started to rise. The government will be much more cautious this time, starting from the premise that it is better to have areas in higher tiers and move them down over time rather than the reverse. But for the public it means post-lockdown life will still see some very strict restrictions for the immediate future. London Mayor Sadiq Khan said it would be the ""right and sensible decision"" for the capital to be placed in tier two, as he warned that tier three would be a ""hammer blow"" to businesses. Liverpool City Region Mayor Steve Rotheram said he hoped the area - which was the first area of England to enter the highest tier in October - would not return to tier three restrictions. He said the city region had made ""remarkable"" progress since being put into tier three, with infection rates in two areas dropping from about 750 per 100,000 people ""to 180 across the city region"". Mayor of Liverpool Joe Anderson told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the city's mass testing programme had enabled it to reduce infections. He said the armed forces have been in the city for three weeks carrying out mass testing and bringing the virus ""back under control again"". Meanwhile, Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham said it was ""more likely than not"" his area would be put into tier three. He said although infection numbers in Greater Manchester were still high, the rates were falling. SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? HOLIDAYS:Where can I go away in the UK? YOUR QUESTIONS:We answer your queries Elsewhere, Lancashire's council leaders have submitted a proposal to the government to divide the county into two different tiers when the lockdown ends next week - as coronavirus rates are lower in places like Lancaster and Wyre than they are in East Lancashire. A request has been made for Hyndburn, Rossendale, Burnley, Pendle and Preston to go into tier three restrictions while Fylde, Wyre, Lancaster, Chorley, South Ribble, Ribble Valley and West Lancashire would go into tier two. This would mean there would be different restrictions on socialising and the hospitality sector in different parts of Lancashire.

The 116-bed hospital built on the site of a former retail unit will treat people with Covid-19, taking patients transferred from the Royal Devon and Exeter NHS Foundation Trust as it is ""very busy"". Devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have the powerto set their own coronavirus regulations, though all four UK nations have agreeda joint plan for Christmas. In Scotland, there is a new five-tier system of restrictions and all non-essential travel between Scotland and the rest of the UK is not allowed. The Scottish government has also said that Christmas bubbles of three households thereshould contain no more than eight people. Children under 12 are not counted towards the eight. In Wales, lockdown restrictions were eased on 9 November and current rules allow two households to form a bubble with up to 15 people able to meet for organised indoor activities. And Northern Ireland will go into a two-week circuit-break lockdown from 00:00 GMT on Friday 27 November.

"With England's lockdown coming to an end, it's all change. A new system of regional tiers will come into force next week. That will be followed by a relaxation of rules at Christmas across the UK which will allow up to three households to meet over the festive period. But scientists are warning the move risks a third wave of Covid. Is the government making a mistake? Scientists have been pretty vocal about their concerns. Prof Andrew Hayward, an expert in infectious diseases at University College London and member of the government's Scientific Advisory Group on Emergencies (Sage), believes the relaxation of restrictions at Christmas is tantamount to ""throwing fuel on the Covid fire"". He warns it is likely to lead to a third wave of infection with ""hospitals being overrun and more unnecessary deaths"". This video can not be played How you and your family can celebrate Christmas and minimise the spread of coronavirus Edinburgh University global public health chair Prof Devi Sridhar, who advises the Scottish government, agrees. She says she cannot understand the move given that the rollout of vaccines is so close. ""Why risk getting infected and infecting others over the holidays? Delaying by a few months is perfectly rational given solutions within sight in the spring."" She now fears we will ""pay for"" Christmas with lockdowns in the new year. What are the Covid rules at Christmas? What is certainly true is that more mixing will lead to more infections. That is a given since the virus thrives on human contact. But there is an argument that what the government is doing will actually help curb infections in both the short and long-term. Modelling done for the government has suggested that for every day of restrictions being relaxed, five days of tougher ones are needed. But others advising ministers think this way of looking at things is too one-dimensional. ""The problem with the modellers,"" says a member of SPI-B, the government committee that advises on human behaviour, ""is that they see a nut and reach for the sledgehammer. ""Banning Christmas was never going to work. People were not going to follow the rules. Providing guidance to help them celebrate safely is perhaps a much better way of managing the situation."" The UK is also not unique in taking this approach. France has announced it will be relaxing the rules at Christmas and other parts of Europe look likely to follow suit in the coming weeks. Prof Stephen Reicher, an expert in social psychology at the University of St Andrews who also sits on SPI-B, says it is impossible to know to what extent the public would have followed the restrictions at Christmas had they remained in place. But he says there was certainly a danger that people would have ""asserted their will"", arguing: ""People don't like being lectured to."" He says that by providing people with the autonomy to make their own decisions, you encourage people to take more responsibility and become actively engaged in working out the best choice to make. And he thinks the pivot from ""paternalism to partnership"" could actually help build trust in the longer term, which will stand the UK in good stead for the rest of the winter in terms of adherence to restrictions and take-up of the vaccine. How to avoid catching Covid this Christmas More trust is certainly needed. Polling by YouGov shows public trust in the government has halved since the spring, with just a third of people happy with its handling of the pandemic. Prof Reicher says what the government has to do now is provide good, clear advice on how to reduce the risks, from ensuring rooms are ventilated to the benefits of isolating before getting together. But he would also like to see some more practical support. As an example, he says the government could provide ""Covid fuel allowances"" to allow people to leave windows open and the heating on during Christmas. Another idea, he says, would be to introduce an extra bank holiday at Easter to provide an incentive to delay family get-togethers to a time when those at most risk are likely to have been vaccinated, and the change in the seasons means there is likely to be less virus around. There are some signs the government is moving in this direction. Ministers have being speaking about the need to use the opportunity to meet up responsibly - with the key message being just because you can, it does not mean you have to. A crucial consideration will, of course, be assessing who is the most vulnerable in each Christmas bubble. Age is the overriding factor when it comes to risk from Covid. But as well as minimising risk, there is also a need to assess the benefits. For some, this could be the last chance they have of a family Christmas. And, even where that is not the case, a year spent not seeing family and being isolated from people has clearly taken its toll. Prof Paul Hunter, from the University of East Anglia's school of medicine, says the benefits on people's mental health of being able to meet up with family over this time ""should not be underestimated"". Indeed, he believes for some it will provide the boost that people need to ""make it through the rest of winter"". But the other factor that is just as important - and this was a point made earlier this week by England's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty - is adherence to the regional tier restrictions in the lead up to Christmas and afterwards. Doing this, he says, will minimise the risks. The move into lockdown was widely interpreted as a sign the regional tiers introduced in mid October were not working. But infection rates were actually stabilising by the time lockdown came in as the chart below shows. And now ananalysis by the University of East Anglia,externalhas shed more light on how they could be more effective. It looked at infection rates across 315 local authority areas across England during the period where tiers were used. It found the tier with the least restrictions - tier one - was largely inadequate in that it was unable to control the virus because rates of infection were too high. Tier two was effective in about half of local authority areas placed in it, while tier three was good enough to drive the R number measuring the rate of infection below one. One of the key problems, the research said, was the fact that areas were often not moved into a higher tier quickly enough. The government says it will learn the lessons from that. It has already moved to beef up the tiers - the top two will see tighter restrictions on hospitality in particular. The hope is that a more intelligent use of the system coupled with the Christmas boost to the public's resolve could suppress virus enough to avoid another lockdown and get us through winter.

Danny AeberhardEurope regional editor, BBC World Service The Museum of London has launched an unusual project to capture how the coronavirus pandemic is affecting Londoners' lives - by collecting their dreams. The museum is working with researchers on dreams at a Canadian research institute. Sigmund Freud described dreams as the ""guardians of sleep"" - a description used as the name of the project, which the Museum of London says is the first of its kind. It seeks to document the effects of the pandemic on the subconscious of Londoners, as they work through some of the struggles and anxieties of the crisis in their sleep. The curator, Foteini Aravani, says people's testimonies will help to provide a more emotional and personal narrative for future generations. Just as many people might be feeling disappointed, frustrated and worried by the new tier system for England, so are MPs, with many in the House of Commons feeling the same way, says BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg. Some of the government's own Conservative MPs might even vote against the plan when it goes before them in the middle of next week. But ""while it might be bumpy"", there is ""not a realistic chance"" of it being blocked in any way. ""Like it or not, this is what is due to come in next Wednesday as the government tries to get control of this disease,"" she adds. Ski lifts stand idle at the resort of Les Menuires in the French Alps Would-be skiers in France have been left baffled after the prime minister said that winter resorts could open in the Alps and Pyrenees for the Christmas period - but that ski lifts would have to remain shut. Jean Castex said that mountain holidays were still a possibility, but that skiing was effectively ruled out. Hotels at resorts would be able to open when the country's national lockdown is lifted on 15 December, he said, while bars and restaurants will remain shut until January at the earliest. French President Emmanuel Macron said earlier this week thatFrance's ski resorts may have to remain closed until next yearbecause the current risks associated with the virus made it difficult for such sports to resume. He said he would discuss the issue with other European leaders and keep the decision under review. Ski resorts were responsible for numerous outbreaks of Covid-19 cases across Europe in the early days of the pandemic. Italy, Austria and Germany have all ordered lifts - even the high-altitude ones - at ski resorts to remain closed for the time being. But Switzerland is allowing ski resorts to remain open as long as they have strict safety measures in place, the health minister said today. David PittamBBC News Online Lia
Primrose (pictured left) is studying health and social care at college. The 17-year-old said: ""It
just feels like a bit of a kick in the teeth after cases went down so much. I work as a waitress so it'll affect me - I can't go back to work now. ""We
watched the announcement in class and he actually said tier two first, then said 'Oh sorry, tier three.' It was the biggest heartbreak. ""My age group is in a

people but we don't have the money because we can't work."" Her classmate, Poppi West, also 17, added:"" It's annoying that we keep going in and out - it feels like we're going round in circles. ""I know it's not the biggest issue but we're both nearly 18 and we won't be able to go out and have a drink to celebrate. It's just a bit sad."" Mass testing was piloted in Liverpool Liam Thorp of the Liverpool Echo asks whether Boris Johnson will increase funding for people who are self-isolating. He also notes that the city hasn't had the best relationship with the Conservatives in the past and asks the PM if he will remember Liverpool's efforts in the future when making funding decisions. ""What's happened in Liverpool has been fantastic,"" replies the prime minister. He says it is not just the testing programme but the way ""everyone pulled together to get the virus down"". ""We are going to keep supporting you throughout Covid and beyond,"" he promises. And that is the last question of today's press conference. Ben Glaze of the Daily Mirror asks if it is a good idea for people to be travelling across the country to hug and kiss elderly relatives. The PM says it has been an ""incredibly difficult decision"" as ministers have to balance people's strong desire to celebrate a family holiday - adding ""which frankly they're going do do anyway"" - and keeping the virus under control. He urges everyone to be ""commonsensical"" and ""do the right thing"". ""Until the vaccine comes on stream, we are not out of the woods yet and we have to be very, very vigilant,"" he adds. Prof Whitty says he would want people to see family, but adds: ""Would I encourage someone to hug and kiss elderly relatives? No, I would not."" He adds while it is not against the law, it does not make sense as you could be carrying the virus. ""The fact you can do something, doesn't mean you should."" Speaking of his own plans for Christmas, he says he will spend it on hospital wards. Sir Patrick Vallance says the key thing is to follow the basic rules of keeping distance where you can, keeping areas well-ventilated and so on. It will not be a normal Christmas and ""hugging elderly relatives is not something to do,"" he adds. They want to survive to be hugged again, adds Whitty.  This video can not be played Coronavirus: 'Take it really seriously during Christmas' Dominic Yeatman of the Metro asks if it is fair that pubs and restaurants forced to close will get support but the businesses that depend on them will not. He also asks if people will still stick to the rules if they believe the end of the virus is in sight. Boris Johnson says closed businesses do deserve protection and cites business grants and the furlough scheme as examples of government help. On the second question, Chris Whitty says he believes people will abide by the rules adding that the ""really heartening thing of this whole dreadful period"" has been the altruism, self-discipline and patience of the British public. ""You can always find some people who haven't followed the rules but they are in the minority,"" he says. Sky News's Beth Rigby asks about the loosening of restrictions over Christmas and whether a rise in cases is anticipated, leading to stricter rules before and afterwards. Prof Chris Whitty says Christmas will increase the risk: ""Everyone knows that, it's not a secret at all."" But it is not the only risk over this next period, he adds, with January and February the most difficult time for the NHS and a ""time of extreme pressure"". It is ""not the time of year where we want to be taking reckless decisions"" because ""things will be difficult for several months"", he adds. Christmas is an element of that but only one element. Christmas can be enjoyed without a spike in cases if people ""take it really seriously"" and ""don't do unnecessary things, just because you can"". People should ""take sensible precautions"", he adds. A number of Conservative MPs have lashed out at the introduction of new tiered Covid restrictions in England. The majority of the country will be placed in the two toughest levels when national lockdown ends on 2 December. The Covid Recovery Group, made up of Tory backbenchers, described the move as ""authoritarianism at work"". The group's deputy chair, Tory MP Steve Baker, called the announcement ""truly appalling"" and questioned if it was ""necessary and proportionate"" to the threat from coronavirus. The government has promised to publish an impact assessment early next week before MPs get a chance to vote on the new rules on Tuesday. But a revolt is brewing among the government's own MPs, including the chair of the influential 1922 committee of backbenchers, Sir Graham Brady. Read more. Military personnel helped at test sites in Liverpool Beth Rigby of Sky News asks how mass testing could be delivered to 40% of the population - asking if the whole British Army would have to be deployed. The PM replies he doesn't ""want to over-sell"" how easy it is to do it, and it ""depends on strong local leadership"" and ""real spirit"" in the local community. It is also ""only part of the panoply of interventions you need to defeat the disease"", he adds. The Army will help and support where necessary, but the key thing is local leaders saying they want the mass testing and the ""local will"" for it to be done. There will be ""adequate personnel"" and there are ""huge stocks"" of the lateral flow tests themselves right now, says Boris Johnson, adding there is hope they'll be made in the UK eventually.  ITV's Robert Peston asks the PM whether he will have to raise taxes and cut spending as a result of the pandemic. He also asks why the government's ""whack-a-mole"" strategy ""didn't work"". On the economy, Boris Johnson says his government is taking steps to ensure the country can ""bounce back from Covid"". ""It will need fiscal prudence - and that you will get from this government,"" he adds. On the lockdown strategy, Chris Whitty says, ""There are tiers that would work in the spring and summer which I would not expect to work at this stage."" Patrick Vallance says implementing weaker restrictions now would mean the government would have to resort to ""much more drastic measures"" later on. ""Madness is doing the same thing twice and expecting different results,"" Whitty adds. Chris MasonPolitical Correspondent The news conference can be summed up like this: the scientists say cases will rise in tier one, they'll hold steady in tier two and they'll fall under tier three. The prime minister wants to offer hope: ""Your tier is not your destiny,"" he says, and, ""By April things will genuinely be much, much better."" But, he adds, we must not ""take our foot off the throat of the beast now"". Boris Johnson knows there is a noisy collection of his own backbenchers who are spitting with anger over what the government's announced. And Labour are yet to commit to backing the government in next week's vote on this - they're expected to decide early next week once they have had the chance to speak to the government's experts. So this is Mr Johnson's case for why his plan is both necessary and, in his view, sensible. Laura Kuenssberg, political editor at BBC News, asks what the point of the national lockdown was if people are now moving to tougher restrictions. Boris Johnson replies it is ""very important"" for everyone to understand that ""this is not continuing the lockdown,"" with shops, hairdressers, gyms and places of worship among the venues reopening. ""This is a very different thing,"" he adds. ""What we have to do is keep eyes on the prize. In a few months we will have a vaccine, I'm absolutely convinced of it now. ""By April things will generally be much, much better."" He warns of relaxing too much now - taking our ""foot off the throat of the beast"" - when we are in a ""much better place"" than before the national lockdown. There are long months ahead but we are not abandoning the fight, he says. He stresses there is now option of mass testing, especially for tier-three communities ""who feel they have endured so much for so long"". Whitty is asked why more areas were not moved to tier three - and he replies that the government was keen to do enough to keep the R below one - but not to do anything unnecessary. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent It's clear the government now has greater confidence about the
impact the regional tiers will have. Research by the University of East Anglia
has shown that tier three is effective at suppressing the virus and tier two
stopped it from rising. Both of these tiers have been beefed up â in particular
around hospitality. The hope of government is that by going in hard and
placing nearly all of England in one of the top two tier, then in the coming
months areas will be able to drop down the tiers. The example of Liverpool is one that offers hope - it has
been placed in tier two, down from tier three before lockdown. The city used the new tool in the armoury â rapid mass
testing. The availability of these tests â which do not need to be
sent to the lab to be processed â is, ministers believe, a way of avoiding a
third lockdown and making progress during winter. Richard from Lancaster asks if the new vaccine will still work if Covid mutates. Patrick Vallance replies, ""This virus doesn't mutate as often as the flu virus but it does mutate."" He says none of the Covid mutations so far have changed in a way that would make the vaccines less effective but it is possible that future mutations might require new vaccines. He adds that making new vaccines would be possible, and points out this is what happens with flu vaccines every year. Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played Rishi Sunak: ""I think it's a reasonable and proportionate response given the context"" Households face a rise in council tax after Chancellor Rishi Sunak cut support for local authorities in his Spending Review, experts say. In its analysis of Wednesday's review the Institute of Fiscal Studies (IFS) said tax bills may have to increase by Â£70 per household on average. The chancellor has given authorities the ability to raise council tax by 5%, IFS director Paul Johnson said. ""This was actually a tax-raising Spending Review,"" he said. ""The chancellor has chosen to reduce support to local authorities and has given them the ability to raise Council Tax by 5% instead. ""If they do, and they'll mostly probably need to, that will increase annual tax bills by an average of around Â£70 per household."" The Spending Review set out the cost to the UK economy so far of dealing with the coronavirus pandemic. Union backlash over public sector pay freeze Economic emergency has only just begun, says Sunak Spending Review: Key points at-a-glance Mr Johnson said the review will feel like a return to austerity for many people. The chancellor has imposed a ""pause"" in pay rises for at least 1.3 million public sector workers, telling the BBC that UK faced ""tough choices"". But Mr Johnson said it was a ""pretty austere"" Spending Review and means ""a tougher time for some public services than expected"". Speaking to BBC Breakfast on Thursday, Mr Sunak said: ""I've had to make some tough choices and what I couldn't do is justify an across-the-board rise in public sector pay."" Private sector wages have fallen as jobs have been lost, hours have been cut and workers have been furloughed, he said. And he warned that unemployment could rise to 2.6 million by the middle of next year. Public sector staff on less than Â£24,000 and some frontline NHS workers will get a wage rise. But Mr Johnson questioned why the government was imposing a pay freeze on much of the public service as the financial benefits would be relatively low. ""There has been no top-up to NHS spending plans after next year,"" he said. ""This may not quite be a return to austerity, but for some public services it may not feel much different."" Mr Johnson said the chancellor appeared to be picking a fight with public sector workers over not very much money On Wednesday, union leaders expressed fury at the pay, warning they would take industrial action to ensure members did not lose out. Mr Johnson said the chancellor had picked a big fight over ""not very much money"" by freezing pay for public sector employees who did not work in the NHS, or who earned less than Â£24,000 a year. He said: ""The decision to freeze public sector pay for some will probably save only between Â£1 and Â£2bn next year. The chancellor has perhaps picked a big fight over not very much money. ""And, as ever, in the public sector the decisions look driven by politics not by economics or the need to spend money either equitably or efficiently."" Meanwhile, the Resolution Foundation think-tank has warned that the Covid-crisis coulddent average pay packets by Â£1,200. ""I am determined to protect jobs and this will help me protect jobs,"" said Mr Sunak. He would not be drawn when asked about tax rises, only saying that the current level of spending was ""unsustainable"". So far, the government has spent Â£280bn to support the economy through the pandemic, and is expected to spend a further Â£55bn next year. But the UK economy is expected to shrink by 11.3% this year, the sharpest decline in 300 years, according to the government's independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR). It is not expected to return to its pre-crisis size until the end of 2022. Despite being able to borrow at record-low rates, Mr Sunak told the BBC's Today programme he would aim to rein in debt. ""Once we get through this and have more certainty over the outlook we should look to restore our public finances to a strong position,"" he said. ""I want to make sure that when the next difficult thing comes along the government can respond."" Mr Sunak defended the government's decision to increase defence spending while cutting international aid from 0.7% of GDP to 0.5%, a move thatprompted a junior minister to resign. ""We believe defence and security is important to this country,"" he said, adding that the law allows the aid budget to be cut under economic decline, despite the target being a Tory manifesto promise. ""We do intend to return to it. It's not a permanent change,"" he said. Shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds says there will have to be higher taxes and spending cuts in the future if interest rates rise, making government borrowing more expensive. But she said that the current focus must be on keeping people in work. ""I think government should be concentrated on protecting people's jobs right now, making sure that new jobs are created,"" she told the Today programme. ""We've got far, far lower ambitions around that than, for example, France and Germany.  That's what government should be focused on right now because that economic damage will ultimately affect the size of our tax base as well as, of course, people's living standards."" Richard Hughes, the chairman of the OBR, told the Today programme that this was ""a very serious moment"" for the UK and ""the biggest shock we've faced in three centuries and the biggest shock the global economy has faced in peacetime"". The impact from the coronavirus is twice the size of the financial crisis in terms of its impact on the economy and the public purse, he said. ""It's something few people have faced in their lifetimes."" One of the longer-lasting effects on the economy is that people are out of work and aren't building their skills, a loss ""we don't get back when this crisis is over,"" Mr Hughes said. The Resolution Foundation has warned that the bulk of the government's extra spending to deal with the ""economic emergency"" will need to come from tax rises. That is ""a matter for the government"", Mr Hughes said.

"This video can not be played Huge crowds gathered at the Casa Rosada in the hope of seeing Diego Maradona's coffin Football legend Diego Maradona has been buried in a private ceremony after a day of emotional scenes in the Argentine capital Buenos Aires. Only around two dozen relatives and close friends attended the final ceremony on Thursday. But earlier huge crowds turned out to pay their respects, with many weeping, blowing kisses and praying as they filed past his coffin. Maradona died of a heart attack on Wednesday aged 60. His death triggered mourning around the world but nowhere was it felt more fiercely than in a country that saw him as a national hero. Maradona dies aged 60 - tributes and reaction Obituary - Argentina's flawed football icon Maradona's coffin - draped in Argentina's national flag and football shirt, bearing his trademark number 10 on the back - was on public display at the presidential palace on Thursday. By mid-afternoon queues stretched back for more than a kilometre, and police clashed with mourners as they tried to close off the palace in anticipation of the wake scheduled for 16:00 local time (19:00 GMT). There were reports of tear gas and rubber bullets being used as officers in riot gear struggled to hold back the crowd. This video can not be played Diego Maradona ""will live in our heart forever"" One well-wisher, RubÃ©n HernÃ¡ndez, thought the police had overreacted. ""We were calm lining up and suddenly, the police started to fire rubber bullets,"" he said, quoted by Reuters news agency. ""Crazy, I just want to say goodbye to Diego."" Maradona: A flawed hero on (and off) the pitch An extraordinary life in pictures Authorities were eventually forced to stop public viewing of the coffin to keep the peace. The motorised funeral cortege drove his body to the Bella Vista cemetery on the outskirts of the city, where he was buried next to the graves of his parents. The atmosphere varied greatly outside the presidential palace. Those waiting to go in were singing and chanting. ""If you don't jump, you're English,"" is one of the favourite chants of Argentinians about the 1986 match with England and THAT goal - the Hand of God - something many here saw as a sort of payback after the Falklands War, known here as the Malvinas. But on the other side of the square, there was another line with those coming out, many wiping away tears or hugging each other after processing what had happened. This wasn't just the death of Argentina's superstar footballer, but the passing of a man that many saw as a national icon, a star who made Argentina famous - and most of all, a very human role-model who Argentinians loved, flaws and all. A man who was respected for achieving so much, yet never forgetting his roots. At the Italian club Napoli, where Maradona played for seven years and transformed their fortunes, fans flocked to the stadium to pay their respects chanting ""Diego, Diego!"". It is the second day people have defied a coronavirus lockdown to pay tribute, ahead of Napoli's closed-door Europa League fixture against the Croatian team Rijeka. The Napoli team, who all stepped onto the pitch wearing black armbands and Maradona's No. 10 jersey, won the match 2-0. Argentine police struggled to control the crowds as they queued to see the coffin Some fans clapped, others wept, as they filed past Maradona's coffin ""He was unique, he represented everything, everything for us Neapolitans,"" fan Gianni Autiero told Reuters. ""I have cried for only a few people in my life, and Diego is one of them."" World mourns Argentine football legend Maradona One of the greatest football players of all time, Maradona had a troubled personal life marked by cocaine and alcohol addiction. He had successful surgery on a brain blood clot earlier in November and was to be treated for alcohol dependency. Local media said the preliminary results of an autopsy showed he had suffered ""acute heart failure"". This video can not be played Watch all of Maradona's World Cup goals The former Argentina attacking midfielder and manager died at his home in Tigre, near Buenos Aires. The last person to see Maradona alive was his nephew Johnny Esposito, according to statements gathered by officials. Maradona is survived by five children and his former wife, 58-year-old Claudia Villafane, whom he split with in 2004 after 20 years of marriage. After news of his death emerged, at 22:00 on Wednesday (01:00 GMT) - an hour chosen to match the number on his shirt - stadiums across Argentina switched on their floodlights to honour his memory. Fans flocked to La Bombonera, Boca Juniors' stadium in Buenos Aires, where many were in tears. Maradona was also revered in the Italian city of Naples, where he played club football for seven years Maradona, who also played for Barcelona, was captain of the national team when Argentina won the 1986 World Cup, scoring the famous ""Hand of God"" goal against England in the quarter-finals. To score the goal, Maradona used his hand to deflect the ball past England goalkeeper Peter Shilton, but the referee did not see it. It remains one of the most controversial World Cup moments. Former Tottenham midfielder Ossie Ardiles, who played alongside Maradona at the 1982 World Cup, told the BBC ""he will be remembered as a genius in football"". Argentina and Barcelona forward Lionel Messi also paid tribute,writing on social media,external: ""He has left us but he will never leave us because Diego is eternal."" Former England striker and Match of the Day host Gary Lineker, who was part of the England team beaten by Argentina at the 1986 World Cup, said Maradona was ""by some distance, the best player of my generation and arguably the greatest of all time"". In a statement on social media, the Argentine Football Association expressed ""its deepest sorrow for the death of our legend"", adding: ""You will always be in our hearts.""

"This video can not be played The BBCâs Anne Soy reports from a refugee camp on the Sudan-Ethiopian border Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed says he is launching the ""final phase"" of the army's operation in the northern region of Tigray after weeks of fighting. He said the military would try not to harm civilians in the regional capital Mekelle - a city of 500,000 people - and urged residents to stay at home. The TPLF party, which controls Mekelle, has vowed to keep fighting. The UN warns of possible war crimes if the Ethiopian army attacks Mekelle. UN human rights chief Michele Bachelet told the BBC the city's inhabitants were in ""deep peril"". ""We're really alarmed by the dangerous situation particularly because of the civilians trapped in Mekelle,"" she said, adding that there was ""potential for serious violations of international humanitarian human rights law"". Africa Live: More on this and other stories Fears of ethnic profiling stalk Ethiopia conflict Crisis has engulfed Ethiopia. Hereâs what it means The UN has also expressed concerns about the lack of access to the region for humanitarian workers. The Ethiopian authorities on Thursday said that ""a humanitarian access route"" overseen by the government will be opened up, adding that they were ""committed to work with UN agencies... to protect civilians and those who need it"". Mr Abiy's announcement on the military operation came after a deadline he gave for Tigray fighters to surrender passed on Wednesday. Hundreds of people have reportedly been killed and thousands have been forced from their homes as Ethiopian forces have seized various towns in Tigray from the TPLF. Details of the fighting are hard to confirm because all phone, mobile and internet communications with the Tigray region have been cut. Mekelle, pictured here on Thursday, is the capital city of the Tigray region Journalist and political activist Daniel Berhane, who is in Mekelle, told the BBC there was no sign yet of any attack, and that shops, cafes and restaurants in the city were ""almost full"". Three African Union representatives have arrived in the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa to try to broker talks but Ethiopia has so far rejected all mediation attempts, saying the conflict is an internal matter and Mr Abiy's government is engaged in a law enforcement mission in Tigray. The three envoys will not be allowed to travel to Tigray. Also on Thursday, Ethiopian troops were deployed along the Tigray region's border with Sudan, where they prevented people fleeing the violence from leaving the country, according to refugees. The BBC's Anne Soy, on the Sudanese side of the border, saw at least a dozen members of the Ethiopian military, leading to a marked decrease in the number of people crossing into Sudan. More than 40,000 people have fled Ethiopia since the conflict began. By Kalkidan Yibeltal, BBC News, Addis Ababa In the ""final phase"" of the military offensive that PM Abiy launched following the expiry of the 72-hour ultimatum, he spoke of a military strategy in which top personnel of the TPLF would be brought to justice without harming civilians or properties in and around Mekelle. It is not clear what that strategy is but it will not be easy to carry it out, particularly if there's active fighting in the city. Artillery attacks, as were suggested by an army official last week, and airstrikes are particularly difficult to conduct without killing civilians and destroying civilian infrastructure. The federal government's troops could be met with a sort of guerrilla warfare from the area outside Mekelle. And it could also take longer than the government would like to conclude the offensive. That could mean a worsening of the humanitarian crisis and consequently more international pressure. In the past three weeks the government has taken control of a number of areas in Tigray but at a cost. An offensive on the state capital - believed to be the main stronghold of the TPLF - could be even more costly. He ordered the Ethiopian military to launch an offensive on Mekelle in the ""third and final phase"" of the federal government's military campaign against the TPLF. Mr Abiy said ""great care"" would be taken to protect civilians and ""all efforts"" would be made to limit damage to Mekelle. Vehicles are seen queuing for petrol in Mekelle, a city of 500,000 people He urged people in Mekelle and the surrounding areas to disarm, stay at home and keep away from military targets. Religious and historical sites, institutions and residential areas would not be targeted, he said. The leader of the powerful regional party, Debretsion Gebremichael, has said Tigray forces are ""ready to die in defence of our right to administer our region"". The TPLF fighters, drawn mostly from a paramilitary unit and a well-drilled local militia, are thought to number about 250,000. Some analysts fear that the situation could turn into a guerrilla conflict - with the TPLF continuing to mount attacks on government forces even if they take Mekelle. This video can not be played The BBC's Matthew Amroliwala challenged Ethiopian government minister Bikila Hurisa over how civilians would be protected One example of how this might play out is the battle for Aksum airport, which according to pro-government sources fell to Ethiopian forces on 11 November and is still controlled by them. But 11 days after the capture state media published pictures of the runway apparently strewn with rubble and with trenches dug across it to prevent planes landing, accusing the TPLF of sabotage attacks. Mr Debretsion denied destroying the airport, saying his forces had put up obstacles to stop the Ethiopian army. How the battle for an Ethiopian airport unfolded Reuters quoted a diplomatic source as saying the TPLF ""have mobilised lots of people in Mekelle"". The person added: ""They are digging trenches and everyone has an AK-47 [rifle]."" This video can not be played 'We came with the clothes on our backs' Aid groups fear the conflict could trigger a humanitarian crisis and destabilise the Horn of Africa region. Ethiopia's state-appointed Human Rights Commission has accused a Tigrayan youth group of being behind a massacre earlier this month in which it says more than 600 non-Tigrayan civilians in the town of Mai-Kadra were killed. The TPLF has denied involvement. This video can not be played Three consequences of the ongoing crisis in Tigray Fact-checking misleading images in Ethiopia conflict The man at the heart of Ethiopia's Tigray conflict Marooned by conflict: 'My little brother needs medicine' How Ethiopia's conflict could destabilise its neighbours The conflict is rooted in longstanding tension between Ethiopia's central government and the TPLF, which was the dominant political force in the whole country until Mr Abiy came to power in 2018 and introduced a series of far-reaching reforms. When Mr Abiy postponed a national election because of coronavirus in June, relations further deteriorated. The TPLF said the central government's mandate to rule had expired, arguing that Mr Abiy had not been tested in a national election. In September the party held its own election, which the central government said was ""illegal"". Then, on 4 November, the Ethiopian prime minister announced an operation against the TPLF, accusing its forces of attacking the army's northern command headquarters in Mekelle.

"More than 60% of the world's population - 4.8 billion people - have received at least one dose of coronavirus vaccine. There are different approved types and brands available and all have undergone rigorous testing and safety checks. Safety trials begin in the lab, with tests and research on cells and animals, before moving on to human studies. The principle is to start small and only move to the next stage of testing if there are no outstanding safety concerns. When will I get a coronavirus vaccine? If the safety data from the labs is good, scientists can check the vaccine or treatment is effective. That means tests on large numbers of volunteers - about 40,000 in the case of Pfizer-BioNTech,the first to be approved in the UK. Half are given the vaccine and the other half a placebo jab. The researchers and participants are not told which group is which, until after the results, to avoid bias. This video can not be played BBC's Laura Foster explains the order in which the Covid vaccine will be given All of the work and findings are checked and verified independently. The Covid vaccine trials happened at breakneck speed, but they didn't skip any steps - they were able to move faster because so many people were involved and other projects were put aside. Approval is only given if regulators are happy that a vaccine is safe and effective. Checks continue after approval to make sure there are no further side effects or long-term risks. In the UK, independent experts on the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation decide how best to use a vaccine and who should get it after approval by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency. Scientists hope to tweak coronavirus vaccines to ensure they continue to offer high protection as new variants of the disease emerge. The UK's drug regulator says new vaccines can befast-tracked for approvalif needed. No corners will be cut, with safety paramount. But lengthy clinical trials with thousands of volunteers will not be needed. Instead, data from existing studies and ongoing real-world use could be used. Pfizer-BioNTech's vaccine (and Moderna's) uses bits of genetic code to cause an immune response. These are called mRNA vaccines. They do not alter human cells, but merely present the body with instructions to build immunity to Covid. The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine uses a harmless virus altered to look a lot more like the pandemic virus. Vaccines sometimes contain other ingredients, like aluminium, that make the vaccine stable or more effective. Vaccines do not give you a disease. Instead, they teach your body's immune system to recognise and fight the infection they have been designed to protect against. Some people do experience mild to moderate symptoms after being vaccinated. This is not the disease itself, but the body's response to the vaccine. Common reactions,externalthat may affect more than one in 10 people and typically get better within days include chills, tiredness and aching muscles. It is rare to find that health problems occurring following a vaccine are actually caused by the vaccine itself. Events may be coincidental and unrelated to vaccination. The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine has beenlinked to very rare cases of blood clots,external. This is not proof that the vaccine is to blame. Covid infection itself can also make clots more likely and they can occur naturally too. The chance of this happening to an individual is still extremely low, but as a precaution, younger age groups in the UK have been offered alternative Covid vaccines. Allergic reactions to vaccines are rare. For any approved vaccine, the ingredients arelisted.,external There have been serious but treatable allergic reactions in a very small number of people given the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. As a precaution, the MHRA says people with a history of significant allergic reactions to any of the ingredients in this vaccine should not currently have this jab. Be aware that anti-vaccine stories are spread online through social media. These posts are not based on scientific advice (or blend facts with misinformation). People will still be offered the jab even if they have had Covid in the past. That's because natural immunity may not be long-lived and immunisation could offer more protection. Guidance,externalsays there are no safety concerns about giving jabs to people with ""long"" Covid either. But people who are currently unwell with Covid-19 should not receive the vaccine until they have recovered. Some vaccines, such as the shingles vaccine and the children's nasal flu vaccine, can contain pork gelatine. The Covid vaccines from Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca do not contain this, or any other animal products. TheBritish Islamic Medical Association,externalsays there is negligible alcohol in it - no more than in bread, for example. How will the vulnerable be protected from Covid?

"This video can not be played Covid: 'A long way to go until everyone is protected' It is not yet known how effective a new vaccine for coronavirus will be for older people, Wales' first minister has said. Mark Drakeford appealed for caution after early resultsshowed a vaccine by Pfizer and BioNTechcould prevent 90% of people from getting Covid. He said he did not want people in Wales to take the wrong message. The Welsh Government is planning to deploy the vaccine should it win regulatory approval for use. The first minister has said theUK government would buy the vaccine on behalf of the whole of the UK, with Wales getting a share reflecting its share of the population. Adam Price, Plaid Cymru leader, said the first minister ""should commit to obtaining a share of the vaccine based on need rather than population"". Should the vaccine pass safety tests, the Welsh NHS will begin to immunise in December, with different groups to be prioritised. ""Health and social care workers, care home residents and staff have been prioritised to receive a vaccine first, with roll-out to older people in age bands from next year,"" a Welsh Government spokesman said. ""There will be limited supplies of a vaccine at first, so it will be offered to those at highest risk."" No guarantees on vaccine but NHS ready - Hancock Covid vaccine: First 'milestone' vaccine offers 90% protection Have we finally got a coronavirus vaccine? Mr Drakeford told members of the Senedd there were still unanswered questions about the Pfizer vaccine, including ""whether or not it will be effective with older people"". He said care home residents and people in ""later stages of life"" would get the next priority after health and social care staff, if it is effective. The first minister accused ""some of the right-wing press"" of reporting in a ""triumphalist way"" Pfizer and BioNTech's announcement. Mark Drakeford agreed the vaccine offered a ""glimmer"" of hope Speaking in the Senedd, he said: ""There are very important steps that have to be taken before that vaccine, or any of the other 11 vaccines that are at Stage 3 trials, might finally come to fruition. ""I really, really do not want people in Wales to take the wrong message from what was being said yesterday. ""We will be fighting coronavirus with the current armoury that we have at our disposal for many months to come and, while we look forward to the day when there is a vaccine, we need to be cautious in the way we approach it."" But Mr Drakeford agreed with a comment from Adam Price that the vaccine offered a ""glimmer"" of hope. ""It is hopeful and we need to have hope in the these difficult times, but we mustn't exaggerate it either,"" the first minister said. He added that storage and distribution will fall under the Welsh Government's responsibility, which was ""particularly important"" for the Pfizer vaccine because it ""can only properly be stored at very low temperatures"". Facilities from the Welsh Blood Service would be used for the vaccine, Mr Drakeford said, which had ""real constraints"" - it can only be taken out of refrigeration on four occasions, and has to be administered twice at a two to three-week interval. The first minister said there may later be a ""case for additional volumes of vaccine coming to Wales and to make sure that the prioritisation that we agree is fine-tuned to meet the needs of Wales' population"". Mr Price, Plaid leader, said: ""The first minister should commit to obtaining a share of the vaccine based on need rather than population, and he needs to provide clarity on who will be prioritised. ""Wales has some of the highest areas of infection in the UK and if - as I have called for today - the vaccine is prioritised for communities at highest risk of infection, Wales will need a greater share. ""We do not want to find ourselves in the situation where the rest of the UK can return to normal, yet Wales hasn't had a sufficient amount of the vaccine to protect all of our most vulnerable."" The vaccine - called an RNA vaccine - has been developed by pharmaceutical companies Pfizer and BioNTech and is one of 11 vaccines that are currently in the final stages of testing. The companies now plan to apply for emergency approval to use the vaccine by the end of November - and a limited number of people may get the vaccine this year. Until it has been approved it will not be possible for countries to begin their vaccination campaigns. It has been tested on 43,500 people in six countries with no safety concerns raised. The UK has already ordered 40 million doses - enough to vaccinate up to 20 million people as each person will need two doses for it to work effectively. UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said theNHS is ready to start providing the new coronavirus vaccine ""as fast as safely possible"".

"This video can not be played Bar chain owner Martin Greenhow: ''This is pure and simple business torture"" The hospitality sector will be ""decimated"" by the new Covid tiers, according to bar chain owner Martin Greenhow, who says it ""isn't viable to operate"" under the conditions. Mr Greenhow, who has bars in cities including Manchester, says the measures are ""a mortal blow"" to the sector. The hospitality industry has warned that tens of thousands of businesses will close without extra support. It comes as more pub groups have been forced to make additional job cuts. Mitchells & Butlers, owner of the All Bar One and Harvester chains, revealed it had cut 1,300 jobs while Fuller Smith & Turner made 350 redundancies. The government has set outwhat level of restrictions England's regions will facewhen lockdown ends with cities such as Manchester, Birmingham and Newcastle put in the highest tiers. But chains such as Mr Greenhow's Mojo bars were struggling even before the second lockdown in England, imposed on 5 November. On the Friday before lockdown, Mr Greenhow's Manchester bar took Â£175. On the same Friday night a year before, it took Â£10,000. Almost all of England facing tough virus rules Pub sector warns it faces 'darkest of moments' New jobs in UK hospitality sector 'non-existent' Even tier one means that bars have less than half the usual number of customers, he says. ""It's simply not a business model that can work,"" he adds. ""Right now, for hospitality, all the tiers are a version of waterboarding. We're allowed out for a brief gasp of fiscal oxygen, then we're slammed back down."" ""This is pure and simple business torture."" UK Hospitality boss Kate Nicholls said the sector is ""bearing the brunt of the pain of closure"" under the new Covid rules. She added that tens of thousands of businesses will close without additional support. Under the new restrictions, pubs in tier 2 regions can only open if they serve substantial meals and households are not allowed to mix indoors. Under tier 3, pubs and restaurants must close their doors but can offer takeaways. Ms Nicholls said that 98% of its members were in areas with tier 2 or tier 3 coronavirus restrictions, and nearly nine in 10 ""say that they are not viable to operate at those level of restrictions"". ""Without additional support to sustain these businesses through this crisis, we are going to see tens of thousands of businesses closing and over a million job losses,"" she added. Birmingham City Council leader Ian Ward said hospitality and other businesses needed a ""meaningful package"" of support from the government so the economy can ""continue to function in an effective way"". ""The crisis faced by hospitality businesses across Birmingham is of particular concern from an economic perspective - a crisis that would have been exacerbated whether our city was placed in tier 2 or 3,"" said Mr Ward. ""Many businesses in this previously thriving sector are warning they may not survive the coming months if they are dealt the double blow of more restrictions and inadequate financial support."" The Night Time Industries Association (NTIA) described the imposition of the tier three level as ""devastating news"" for those areas. ""The government must compensate these businesses for the period of time they have been closed, and the loss of business suffered due to restrictions through the festive period,"" said NTIA chief executive Michael Kill. The British pub industry sent a letter on Wednesday pleading with Prime Minister Boris Johnson to save the industry, which it said was facing ""the darkest of moments"".

"US President Donald Trump has pardoned his former national security adviser Michael Flynn, who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI. The president said the widely expected act of clemency was his ""Great Honor"". Mr Flynn was convicted during a justice department inquiry into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 election. Leading Democrats condemned the pardon. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called it ""an act of grave corruption and a brazen abuse of power"". The White House said that the pardon would finally end ""the relentless, partisan pursuit of an innocent man"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mr Flynn, who admitted in 2017 to lying to the FBI about contacts with Russia's ambassador but then tried to withdraw his plea, responded by posting a tweet containing a US flag emoji and a Biblical verse, Jeremiah 1:19. The verse says: ""'They will fight against you but will not overcomeÂ you, for I am with youÂ and will rescueÂ you,' declares theÂ Lord."" The retired US Army three-star lieutenant general was an early and ardent supporter of Mr Trump during the 2016 campaign, though he had been a life-long Democrat before. Mr Flynn was among the new president's first appointments - Mr Trump brought him on just days after winning the election. The two saw eye-to-eye on many issues, including the advantages of closer ties with Russia, renegotiating the Iran nuclear deal and combating the threat from Islamic State militants. Profile: Michael Flynn, Trump's ex-adviser The White House revolving door: Who's gone? But he lasted just 23 days as national security adviser, the president's chief counsellor on international affairs and defence. Mr Trump fired him after it emerged that he had discussed lifting sanctions on Russia with Moscow's ambassador to Washington before Mr Trump took office, and misled the vice-president about that conversation. This video can not be played ""Michael Flynn's loyalty to Trump has paid off"" - former Trump adviser Omarosa Manigault Newman Although he initially agreed to co-operate with prosecutors, Mr Flynn asked to withdraw his guilty plea in January this year, arguing he had been duped into the agreement. The Department of Justice had sought for his charges to be dropped, prompting a legal battle that ran for much of 2020. Former President Barack Obama said he had warned Mr Trump against hiring the former general less than 48 hours after the November 2016 election. Mr Flynn's supporters see him as the victim of a political vendetta by the outgoing Obama administration to de-legitimise the incoming Trump administration with claims of Russian collusion. A 22-month inquiry led by widely respected former director of the FBI Robert Mueller concluded in 2019 that Russia had interfered in the 2016 election, but found no evidence of a criminal conspiracy between Mr Trump's 2016 presidential campaign team and Moscow. The White House statement on Wednesday described Mr Flynn as ""the victim of partisan government officials engaged in a co-ordinated attempt to subvert the election of 2016"". Mr Trump has made frequent but unsubstantiated claims that millions of votes were illegally cast in 2016, and continues to make similarly unsubstantiated claims of fraud in the 2020 poll. Pardons wipe out a conviction while commutations lessen the punishment - both are clemency rights granted to the president by the Constitution. It is common for outgoing presidents to issue pardons. This video can not be played Are presidential pardons Trump's secret weapon? Mr Trump currently has the least number of pardons and commutations of any modern US president,according to the Pew Research Center,external. His predecessor Barack Obama granted 212 pardons and 1,715 commutations - the most since President Harry Truman. Here are some of the big names from the 28 pardons and 16 commutations Mr Trump has issued so far: Roger Stone, a long-time ally, who was convicted last year of lying to Congress and witness tampering. He had his prison sentence commuted Arizona's ""toughest sheriff""Joe Arpaio, convicted of criminal contempt after defying an order to stop patrols targeting suspected undocumented immigrants, was pardoned Former vice-president Dick Cheney's chief of staffScooter Libby, who was found guilty of lying about leaks to the media, was also pardoned Women's voting rights pioneerSusan B Anthony, who was convicted of illegal voting and fined in 1873 was granted a posthumous pardon Crystal Munoz, Judith Negron and Tynice Hall, three mothers of young children who were serving sentences for drug and white-collar crimes and whose cases were brought to the president by Kim Kardashian, had their sentences commuted US media report that a number of Trump allies are also hoping for clemency in the days to come, including ex-advisers Rick Gates and George Papadopoulos, who were both convicted in the Mueller investigation. Republicans described Mr Flynn as a hero who suffered an unfair prosecution. South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham said: ""General Flynn was NOT a Russian agent. Instead, he was the victim of a politically motivated investigation and prosecution where the ends justified the means."" In the US House of Representatives, Republican minority leader Kevin McCarthy tweeted: ""What happened to @GenFlynn was a national disgrace. No American should ever be targeted for simply belonging to a certain political party."" But Democrats swiftly condemned the move. Ms Pelosi said in a statement: ""Sadly, this pardon is further proof that Trump plans to use his final days in office to undermine the rule of law in the wake of his failed presidency."" House Judiciary Committee chairman Jerrold Nadler said in a statement:Â ""This pardon is undeserved, unprincipled, and one more stain on President Trump's rapidly diminishing legacy.""

"Online fashion retailer Boohoo has appointed a former High Court judge to examine its business practices. Sir Brian Leveson, who is best known for leading the inquiry into press ethics after the phone hacking scandal, will chair an independent review of the company's supply chain and ethics. It follows allegations that one of Boohoo's suppliers was paying workers less than the minimum wage. It was also alleged the supplier failed to protect workers against Covid-19. Boohoo admitted there were failings in its supply chain and said it was committed to raising standards and monitoring its suppliers more closely. Its group chairman, Mahmud Kamani, said the appointment of Sir Brian, along with auditors KPMG, would bring ""independent oversight, additional expertise and further transparency to a programme that will help us on our journey to lead the fashion e-commerce market globally in a transparent manner"". The company says Sir Brian will work with a team of legal and compliance specialists. MP demands Boohoo bosses quit over 'exploitation' Boohoo profit soars despite factory conditions row In July, the Sunday Times reported that workers in a Leicester factory which supplied Boohoo were working for as little as Â£3.50 an hour and that few of its workers were wearing face masks to guard against the spread of the coronavirus. At the time Boohoo said that if the the allegations were true, conditions were ""totally unacceptable"" and it promised a thorough investigation. The company set up a review into its working practices led by Alison Levitt QC.She concluded,externalthat, while the problems in Leicester garment factories were long-standing, Boohoo had not taken enough responsibility for scrutinising its suppliers and had chased profit at the expense of other obligations. Mahmud Kamani and Carol Kane set up Boohoo in 2006 Mr Kamani, who is now a billionaire, set up Boohoo in 2006 with designer Carol Kane to sell clothes directly, and cheaply, to shoppers. During lockdown the company saw a surge in sales and it reported a 51% jump in profits for the year to the end of August. But after the allegations that workers in the factory that was supplying Boohoo's Nasty Gal brand were being exploited, several of Boohoo's best known clients dropped it, with Next, Asos and Berlin-based Zalando all removing Boohoo clothes from their websites. Sir Brian will report to Boohoo's board and has promised to provide regular, publicly available progress reports. ""Boohoo has recognised that it must institute and embed change so that everyone involved in the group's supply chain is treated fully in accordance with the law and the principles of ethical trading,"" he said.

"The now-scrapped relief road was proposed as a solution to tackling congestion on the M4 around Newport Â£800m should be invested in public transport to help ease traffic jams on the M4, a report has recommended. A commission was set upafter Welsh ministers scrapped plans to build a Â£1.6bn relief roadaround Newport. To encourage people out of their cars, its report suggested considering a ""workplace parking levy"" and ensuring public transport was ""affordable for all"". The panel was told not to consider plans for another motorway. TheM4 around Newport is the fourth most congested stretch of road in the UK. The South East Wales Transport Commission recommended tripling the number of train stations between Cardiff and the River Severn, from three to nine, as well as establishing bus and cycle route networks in Newport. If all the recommendations were acted on, it suggested more than 90% of people in Cardiff and Newport would live ""within one mile of a rail station or rapid bus corridor"". The report recommended better integration and coordination of rail and bus networks and integrated tickets across all services. Services should run every 15 minutes and stations should be more accessible on foot and for cyclists. Currently, common M4 journeys are poorly served by public transport alternatives, it said, with Newport served particularly poorly by rail. It said ""flexible office hubs"" should be established in major towns and cities, in order to support remote working. Although most M4 journeys cannot be substituted by walking or cycling because of their distance, the report said active travel had ""a key role"". Newport M4 traffic jams: Average 50mph limit recommended Call for public transport boost to ease M4 jams The commission suggested making walking or cycling the ""natural choice"" for the first and last mile of public transport journeys and recommend establishing ""a major cycleway"" linking Cardiff and Newport. Although travel habits have changed due to Covid-19, the report said those changes ""do not fundamentally alter"" the need for more transport options and claimed the pandemic provided ""an opportunity to prepare significant transport improvements while demand is reduced"". A 20% reduction in flow on the M4 would have a significant positive impact on journey times, it said. This video can not be played ""Everything outside gets dirty and it affects our chests - it's dreadful."" The commission, chaired by Lord Burns, described its recommendations as ""ambitious yet achievable"". It said its ""fast track"" recommendations - made in a progress update in December 2019 - were ""consistent"" with their final recommendations. This included the introduction of a 50mph average speed control and more lane guidance on the westbound approach to the Brynglas tunnels in Newport. The report said the cost of the recommendations would be between Â£600m and Â£800m: The majority of the cost would be in developing the rail network on the south Wales main line - costing between Â£390m and Â£540m Developments on the line would include new stations on Newport Road in Cardiff and a new Cardiff Parkway station in St Mellons, plans for which have already been developed by a private company In Newport, the report suggested creating a Newport West station near Tredegar Park, and a Newport East station in Somerton, as well as stations at Llanwern and Magor A bike hire scheme, similar to Nextbike in Cardiff, should be established in Newport too At peak times, between 3,000 and 5,000 vehicles approach the Brynglas tunnels every hour. Alleviating congestion on the M4 by moving commuters and travellers on to public transport would benefit goods and services traffic which are less able to switch to other modes of transport, according to the report. Could UK government build an M4 relief road? Welsh road tolls and charging to be considered in review Environmentalists had long-opposed the plans for the scrapped relief road First Minister Mark Drakefordscrapped plansto build a Â£1.6bn relief road last year after declaring a climate emergency because of its environmental impact, as well as the effect on the public purse. Welsh Secretary Simon Hart said in October theUK government had not ruled out bypassingthe Welsh Government to build to road. The commission said in principle it was in favour of road charging, but was not recommending this due to the absence of a UK-wide scheme, but said it should be considered again in future. The UK government said it continued to believe that a relief road remained the ""most viable solution to the ongoing congestion problems"" around Newport. A spokesman added: ""The report is welcome and highlights the undoubted necessity for improvements in south Wales' transport infrastructure. ""The need to make improvements for people using the road and rail network is why the UK government launched its Union Connectivity Review last month.""

"There are several junctions on the stretch of the M4 through Newport An average speed limit of 50mph should be introduced to tackle congestion on the M4 around Newport, the commission set up after the decision to scrap the relief road has said. South East Wales Transport Commission recommended ""fast-track"" measures to ease traffic at the Brynglas tunnels. These would help reduce the ""ripple effect"" of changes in speed which disrupt traffic, it said. The 50mph limit between junctions 24 and 28 would apply all day. In a progress report on its work, the commission conceded this would mean slower travel times for vehicles at off-peak times. ""It is worth noting the case for 50mph speed control goes beyond congestion alleviation. There are also good arguments from an emissions and road safety perspective - these apply to all parts of the day,"" it said. It also recommended providing ""additional lane guidance"" on the westbound approach to the tunnels and collapsible bollards to prevent late lane changes. The report called for better traffic officer support, with formalised response time targets and a wider patrol area to cover the A48 and A4810 in Newport. The commission was formed in October in the wake of the controversial decisionto scrap the M4 relief road, andwas told to look at alternatives. The commission looked at the M4 between junctions 23 and 29. The report said: ""Congestion worsens when vehicles travel at different speeds and frequently change lanes. This is particularly significant when approaching the Brynglas tunnels at peak times. ""We believe there are some traffic management measures that can help alleviate some of the problem."" The report said the M4 near Newport was the fourth most congested stretch of urban motorway in the UK and ranked in the top 50 hotspots in Europe. It found the motorway struggled to provide reliable travel for more than 3,000 to 4,000 vehicles per hour - at peak times, traffic approaching the tunnels was about 4,000 to 5,000 vehicles per hour. Proposals cost Â£114m before scheme was axed M4 commission 'will not be invited to spend Â£1bn' The majority of journeys involved Cardiff, Newport and Bristol and data suggested there were more people living in Wales and working in England than the reverse, it said. Congestion was a symptom of broader issues, it added, ""in particular the lack of viable or attractive alternative transport options"". ""Our initial analysis shows that for trips within the region, private car travel on the motorway is very often both quicker and cheaper than public transport, even accounting for congestion. This understandably prompts people to use their cars."" The majority of journeys through this stretch of the M4 involved Cardiff, Newport and Bristol, the report said The report said there was ""merit"" in improving alternative forms of transport for the most popular journeys. The commission said its considerations would include: options for better cycle routes between Cardiff and Newport how to manage demand for different types of transport at different times, including charges that could provide funding for public transport ways to promote public transport to get people out of their cars, including better information, ticketing, and working with larger employers how to improve public transport to give more choice for journeys between Cardiff, Newport and Bristol. The commission said it aimed to publish an interim report in the spring 2020 and a final report around the end of 2020. CBI Wales director Ian Price said the report was disappointing and the recommendations would ""do very little to help anyone"". ""Business keenly awaits the second part of the commission's work. South Wales deserves a road fit for the future. The government must do more than just solve congestion - it must give the region room to grow,"" he said. Ben Francis, FSB Wales policy chairman, said it was crucial improvements were made ""on this vital infrastructure corridor"". ""As the commission's report recognises, road-based solutions are not the only answer to transport issues in south Walesâ¦ Providing reliable, good quality public transport through the South Wales Metro and other options will be as important for the overall transport issues in south Wales.""

"M4 congestion at Newport is ""very much a commuter problem"", Lord Burns says More investment in public transport is needed in south east Wales to ease congestion on the M4, the man asked to look at possible solutions has said. Lord Burns is leading a commission on the issue after the first ministerditched plans for a Â£1.6bn M4 relief roadaround Newport last summer. He said on Thursday that for many commuters the car was currently the only option for travelling to work. A congestion charge could be needed to address the issue, Lord Burns added. M4 relief road alternatives commission set-up Â£114m spent on M4 road project M4 relief road axed by Welsh Government Giving evidence to the assembly's Economy Committee, Lord Burns said his commission had looked at traffic patterns on the M4 and found there was ""a very clear picture"" that the congestion is ""to a significant degree a symptom of a lack of alternative transport options"". The congestion was ""very much a commuter problem"", he said, with around two thirds of the morning traffic heading east to west between junctions 24 and 29 consisting of people travelling to Cardiff and Newport. ""For many people there is no alternative or convenient way of getting to and from work other than by car,"" he said. ""The costs would be much higher and the journey times much longer if they tried to go by some other means."" Lord Burns said people need alternatives to cars before they are charged for using roads Lord Burns said his ""overwhelming conclusion"" was that ""the public transport network is heavily under-invested in compared to what is needed"". He also said the flow of traffic on the M4 had increased ""quite markedly"" since the tolls were scrapped on the Prince of Wales bridge in December 2018. Asked about congestion charging, Lord Burns said it was important to provide people with feasible alternatives first. ""If you provide people with alternatives then I think road pricing is not only possible but it could well be a necessary part of the package."" Cardiff Council has recently revealedproposalsfor introducing a congestion charge on drivers travelling into the city. Lord Burns emphasised that his commission was not being asked to assess how potential solutions would compare with the scrapped relief road scheme. He also said it would not be looking at a new ""motorway-style solution"". The commission hopes to make its recommendations to the Welsh Government before the end of the year. Lord Burns said it will consider a range of factors including carbon emissions, air quality and value for money.

"This video can not be played Rhodri and Jess Garland say they are worried that their home will be flooded again if more storms hit Severe flooding followed by the Covid-19 pandemic left people in parts of the south Wales valleys deeply traumatised, a report from politicians says. It calls on health officials to carry out an assessment  of the impact and support available in Rhondda Cynon Taf. Flood warning drills and setting up a ""community flood ambassadors"" network are also recommended. In response to the report, Cwm Taf Morgannwg health board said support for those affected was being provided. The Welsh Government also said 25 flood alleviation schemes had taken place across the Rhondda Cynon Taf (RCT) area at a cost of Â£1.9m. This is in addition to Â£1.6m in funding to the area to carry out repair works to drainage, culverts and other measures. Plaid Cymru is calling for an independent public inquiry. The report, written by Pontypridd MP Alex Davies-Jones and member of the Senedd Mick Antoniw, calls for flood emergency drills to be carried out to check areas are protected. Mr Antoniw said February saw the ""worst flooding anyone could remember"". ""As winter approaches, there is now considerable fear as to what the future holds,"" he explained. ""We're very concerned that in conjunction with the Covid experience people have had a double whammy of trauma - there really is a need now to assess the mental wellbeing of communities."" Flood-hit families struggle with virus lockdown Securing 2,000 coal tips 'could cost over Â£500m' Watchdog's flooding response 'fell short' The report was based on meetings with agencies who responded to the flooding, as well as ministers and residents. Rhodri and Jess Garland lost treasured possessions when their home flooded Rhodri and Jess Garland say they are now anxious every time it rains around their home, in Egypt Street, Treforest. With a three-year-old son and another baby on the way in March, the couple ""just want to know we're safe - how do we know it's not going to happen again, like it did in February?"". Work to renovate their ruined home has pushed the family into debt as their insurance cover did not include storm or flood damage. ""We had to replace everything - the kitchen, living room furniture - even the front door,"" Mrs Garland explained. ""There are some things we're never going to get back - our wedding certificate has mud all over it and our photos have been damaged."" The Garlands' home was left under water The Garlands' house insurance did not cover them for flood damage Mr Garland said they felt ""forgotten"" by the Welsh Government, and a Â£1,000 grant given in the aftermath of the flooding ""hasn't scratched the surface"". ""It's put a great strain on us and if it wasn't for our local community, the rugby club I play for, our work - if it wasn't for their help in cushioning the blow we would have been in a much worse financial state,"" he added. ""We do have a lot of anxiety now - how am I supposed to work when I have flood alerts coming up on my phone every time it rains?"" Streets in RCT were left under water during February's storms Mr Antoniw said children and the elderly had been particularly affected, and he urged the local health board to investigate the extent to which counselling is available. The report also recommends the Welsh Government provides a fund to help homeowners who would otherwise struggle to afford to put in their own defences such as flood gates and doors. A network of flood ambassadors should be set up in all affected communities to play ""a central role in ensuring community-readiness is maintained"" - including access to local stocks of sandbags, it said. And there should be a periodic flood warning drill carried out by Natural Resources Wales and the emergency services. The idea is partly to provide reassurance to residents that all procedures are working as required. Storms Ciara, Dennis and Jorge in early 2020 led to record rainfall and river flows across Wales and the most widespread flooding seen since 1979. In Rhondda Cynon Taf alone almost 1,500 homes and businesses were affected, with people forced to leave their homes. Sara Moseley, director of mental health charity Mind Cymru, said the floods had been ""terrifying"" and it was natural for people to feel afraid or anxious. This video can not be played In February 2020, Storm Dennis battered Wales causing widespread flooding But she said people had had their homes and livelihoods ""wiped out"" by firstly the floods, and then the coronavirus pandemic, and the impact of the double trauma was extremely worrying. She said the report highlighted a close link between living in challenging circumstances and mental health, and equality needed to be ""driven up"". ""What we're looking for is really strong communities where people understand what's happening, they have hope and we're investing in every aspect of life,"" she said. Dr Kelechi Nnoaham, director of Public Health at Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board, said support was available for those affected by flooding and coronavirus, and urged people to contact their GP. ""We are aware of the potential for significant detrimental effect on public health and wellbeing of the flooding which occurred across our communities earlier this year,"" he said. ""This is potentially compounded by the challenges of Covid, and the losses being experienced in those same communities."" Plaid Cymru's Rhondda MS Leanne Wood said the failure to support an independent public inquiry into the floods was a ""glaring omission"" from the report. A Welsh Government spokesman added: ""Our recent national Flood and Coastal Risk Management Strategy also outlines we believe property flood resilience (PFR) measures are better employed at community scale, rather than providing schemes direct to homeowners, many of whom may not choose to apply - this also ensures the right properties receive measures. ""However, we encourage all Risk Management Authorities (RMAs) to consider PFR measures where they are an appropriate option.""

"This video can not be played In February, 60,000 tonnes slipped down the hillside at Tylorstown More than half a billion pounds could be needed to ensure the safety of 2,000 old coal tips in Wales over the next 10 years, the chancellor has been warned. It follows calls for urgent action, followinga 60,000 tonne landslideearlier this year in Rhondda. Geologists said Wales was more prone to these incidents and climate change ""may make that worse"". UK officials said they were working with the Welsh Government on flood relief, including funding for tips. The incident above the village of Tylorstown followed heavy rain caused by Storm Dennis in February, which led towidespread floodingacross areas including Rhondda Cynon Taf. One historian said the landslide had evoked ""visceral"" emotions linked tothe Aberfan disaster of 1966, which claimed the lives of 116 children and 28 adults. A letter from Chris Bryant MP and Labour colleagues to Chancellor Rishi Sunak revealed unpublished details from a review led by the Welsh Government, with the co-operation of the Coal Authority, councils and Natural Resources Wales. The review is compilinga list of all sites in Wales and their risk status,external. Mud and debris continued to fall on the hillside for days after the initial landslide In October, the UK government provided Â£2.5m to help clean up and secure the Tylorstown site. The Welsh Government said the cost of clear-ups and making Wales' coal tips safe was ""significantly more"". Repair work in Rhondda Cynon Taf is estimatedat Â£82.5m in total. Mr Bryant and fellow Welsh Labour MPs Beth Winter, Chris Elmore and Alex Davies-Jones said it would be ""unfair"" for the ""poorest communities in the UK to bear the full costs of this work"". They fear another Tylorstown-like incident if the framework for funding the work is not done soon. The letter also calls for the UK government to provide financial assistance to Rhondda Cynon Taf for urgent repair work to bridges, roads and culverts following Storm Dennis. The UK government has previously said it is up to the Welsh Governmentto remediate the coal tips and ""get on"" with flood defence work. But in a new statement, officials added: ""Ever since parts of Wales were hit by devastating flooding earlier this year, the UK government has been working with the Welsh Government and local authorities to provide extra support for flood relief and protection to the communities which were so badly affected. ""Responsibility for flood defences and flood management is devolved but, while all claims need to meet certain criteria, we expect to provide funding from the UK reserve for 2020-21."" It added: ""This would include funds for coal tip repairs which we know are of particular concern to communities."" Why is Wales so prone to landslides? Life on a 'moving mountain' 'Without coal Wales would be part of England' The Labour Member of the Senedd for Pontypridd, Mick Antoniw, said clearing coal tips ""goes way beyond any responsibilities of the Welsh Government"". ""The film of the coal sliding down brought back many, many traumatic memories for the population of Wales. ""And I think the wake-up call for us all is that the risk may be a bit greater than we thought it was, particularly if we're going to have more adverse weather like this."" The Tylorstown landslide has left a scar on the hillside Ben Curtis, a historian of the south Wales coalfields at Wolverhampton University, said incidents like the one at Tylorstown had a powerful impact. ""I visited the Tylorstown tip in the aftermath. ""Just struck by the scale of the landslip. It's really quite awe inspiring and not in a good way. ""These register so prominently with people because on a visceral level people in the valleys see a tip slide, and you think about the Aberfan disaster of course."" Ashley Patton, from the British Geological Survey, said the conditions in Wales made it more prone to these types of landslips. ""In south Wales we have the added pressure of a lot of coal waste sitting on top of those slopes which is unconsolidated material and can easily slip. Climate change may only make that worse. ""With increased storms like the ones we saw at the beginning of this year, landslides, which is what you'd expect with climate change, is going to be a real problem."" The Welsh Government said the safe management of coal tips ""remains a priority"". ""While we welcome recent announcements by UK government, along with their recognition that the longer-term costs will be significant, no further funds have been forthcoming, and we continue to press them for the full amount of funding needed, as promised by the prime minister,"" said a spokesman.

"This video can not be played In February 2020, Storm Dennis battered Wales causing widespread flooding Last winter's powerful storms and flooding stretched Wales' environment watchdog so much that its response ""fell short"" in areas. A Natural Resources Wales (NRW) review found there were staffing and equipment problems and missing flood warnings. Its chief executive said a ""seismic shift"" was needed in how Wales manages flood risk and called for more funding. The Welsh Government said it would continue to work with all partners to reduce the risk from flooding. Storms Ciara, Dennis and Jorge in early 2020 led to record rainfall and river flows across Wales and the most widespread flooding seen since 1979. There were 3,130 properties affected in what would later be confirmed by the Met Office as the wettest February on record and the fifth wettest month since records began in 1862. NRW issued a record 242 flood alerts, 181 warnings and six severe flood warnings. The ground floor of 16 homes on Clydach Terrace, next to a ""brook"" in Ynysybwl, were left covered in mud after the floodwater receded Shortcomings in the flood warning system were identified - with 12 warnings missed altogether and six issued late. The report said the network of flood defences across Wales helped protect 73,000 properties from flooding, but in some cases the water flowed over the top. It said other measures would be needed, such as holding back water higher up in the catchment, but in some cases there needed to be an acceptance there would be flooding during such major events. ""We also need to make properties more flood-proof, invest in warning systems, community support and advice so that communities can take their own actions to lessen the impacts of flooding,"" it said. ""Householders and individuals also need to take a share of responsibility."" Across four independently reviewed reports, NRW found its staff's actions played a ""significant part"" in mitigating against even more severe problems across Wales, but its resources did not match the ""size of the task at hand"". It concluded an additional 60-70 full-time staff are required to work on flooding. Some additional money from the Welsh Government was being used for staffing in the short term, but more permanent funding was needed. There were also problems around the availability of vehicles and other equipment such as mobile phones that could withstand the conditions. NRW chief executive Clare Pillman said they took the report seriously and changes were needed to improve their service Flooding: 'Conversation needed' on risk in Wales Governments in 'dialogue' on Storm Dennis repairs funding Rhondda Cynon Taf flooding: Calls for public inquiry The report concluded difficult choices needed to be made about the level of service that is ""practical, realistic and feasible"", the  investment required and ""how risks are managed"". Chief executive Clare Pillman said they accepted where changes were needed to improve their service, but the February floods should ""ignite discussions"" around adapting to future flood threats. ""There are clearly lessons to learn... for all bodies responsible for flood risk management in Wales."" Roads were flooded in Llanrwst in Conwy county during Storm Ciara February 2020 was the fifth wettest month since records began in 1862 - and the wettest February ever. During Storm Ciara it is estimated that river levels in St Asaph on the River Elwy were the highest since records began in 1974 - higher than November 2012 when the town experienced major flooding, showing the benefits of the improved defences. During Storm Dennis, more than one in five of NRW's river gauges in Wales recorded their highest-ever water levels. At the River Taff's peak flow on 15 February, it is estimated 805 cubic metres per second was passing through Pontypridd, enough to fill an Olympic size swimming pool in just over three seconds The River Usk reached a record 5.6m (18ft) at its peak. ""We're just lucky no-one died,"" says Paul Thomas In the early hours of 16 February, Clydach Terrace in Ynysbwl felt the full effects of Storm Dennis. Resident Paul Thomas said some houses were under 7ft (2.1m) of water. ""It came with such force [that] the doors burst open front and back - it was terrifying,"" he said. ""We're just lucky no-one died."" He added: ""There are a lot of issues going on - if it's going to cost too much money - buy us out. ""Write the street off and we'll move - it's as simple as that because I don't want to go through that again."" A spokesman for Welsh Government said agencies had been stretched by the scale of the flooding earlier this year. It added NRW had done a ""thorough review"" to identify improvements to flood defences and warning systems.

"Abdalraouf Abdallah was convicted of terror offences in 2016 A convicted terrorist organiser, who has refused to tell an inquiry about his contact with the Manchester Arena bomber, is to be released from jail. Abdalraouf Abdallah, 27, was jailed in 2016 after being found guilty of helping people travel to Syria to join the Islamic State group. The Manchester Arena Inquiry heard he was in touch with bomber Salman Abedi in the months leading up to the attack. The BBC understands he will be released on licence later this week. A source said his licence conditions would be among the strictest imposed on a released prisoner. Arena attacker calls 'on terror inmate's phone' Paraplegic man guilty of terror charge The road to the Manchester Arena bombing The Manchester Arena Inquiry, which is investigating all aspects of the attack carried out by Salman Abedi in May 2017 that killed 22 people, has heard that Abdallah is a ""witness with important evidence to give"". But, when interviewed in prison this summer by inquiry lawyers, Abdallah refused to answer any questions in case he incriminated himself. Abdallah, who moved to the UK as a child and grew up in south Manchester, was paralysed from the waist down while fighting in the Libyan revolution of 2011. In July 2016 he was jailed for five years and six months,having been convicted following a trial, but time spent on remand and on curfew at home means that his custodial sentence expires this week. When released, he will spend a further four years on licence. His trial heard that, from his wheelchair and mainly using a mobile phone, Abdallah arranged for the movement of money and fighters to Syria. When Abdallah was sentenced, the judge said ""there was no evidence of indoctrinating of others"". However, the Arena inquiry has heard that when Abdallah had been arrested in 2014, his phone containedcorrespondence with Abedi about suicide, martyrdom - including the death of a senior al-Qaeda figure - and ""maidens of paradise"". Those who knew Abedi considered Abdallah to be a radicalising influence on him. Abedi visited Abdallah in prison and spoke to him on an illegally held mobile phone during the period in early 2017 when the bomb was being prepared. The prison authorities confiscated Abdallah's phone before the attack and - when analysed - it was found to have been used to make calls and attempted calls to Abedi's number. That a man jailed for terrorist organising via a phone was able to obtain a mobile in prison, which he used to speak to a known extremist like Abedi, is a focus for the inquiry. The bombing after an Ariana Grande concert killed 22 people and injured hundreds more Paul Greaney QC, counsel to the public inquiry, has said the relationship between Abdallah and Abedi seemed to have been of ""some significance in the period prior to the bombing and we are determined to get to the bottom of it"". Lawyers for bereaved families have said the ""failure to recognise the association between Salman Abedi and Abdalraouf Abdallah was a real missed opportunity"". Like Abdallah, the Abedi family have refused to answer questions posed by the inquiry, with eldest brother Ismail Abedi also asserting a claimed privilege against self-incrimination. It is understood that Abdallah's licence conditions will be similar to those imposed on the hate preacher Anjem Choudary,who was released on licence two years ago. The measures are understood to include: Being placed in supervised probation accommodation not in Manchester, wearing a GPS tag, obeying a curfew and reporting in several times a day, as well as engaging with the government's ""desistance and disengagement"" de-radicalisation scheme Barring him from Manchester city centre, where the inquiry is taking place, as well as Moss Side and surrounding areas in the south of the city, where he previously lived A ban on unsupervised internet use, limits on phone use, surrender of his passport, and not being allowed to give talks or sermons He will also not be allowed contact with any serving prisoner or anyone convicted of a terrorism offence, nor unsupervised contact with anyone under 18 There has been significant public debate over the past the year following attacks in London - atFishmongers' HallandStreatham- by recently released prisoners convicted of terror-related offences. An independent review has highlighted a catalogue of failings in how offenders are managed after release,making 45 recommendations for how the system needs to improve. A Ministry of Justice statement said: ""Terrorists released on licence are supervised by the probation service, with the support of police and the security services, and subject to strict conditions including restrictions on their internet use, movements and contact with others. ""If they break those conditions they can be brought back to prison.""

"The coronavirus pandemic could wipe out 25 years of increasing gender equality,new global data from UN Women,externalsuggests. Women are doing significantly more domestic chores and family care, because of the impact of the pandemic. ""Everything we worked for, that has taken 25 years, could be lost in a year,"" says UN Women Deputy Executive Director Anita Bhatia. Employment and education opportunities could be lost, and women may suffer from poorer mental and physical health. The care burden poses a ""real risk of reverting to 1950s gender stereotypes"", Ms Bhatia says. Even before the pandemic, it was estimated women were doing about three quarters of the 16 billion hours of unpaid work that are done each day around the world. In other words, before coronavirus, for every one hour of unpaid work done by men, three hours was done by women. Now that figure is higher. ""If it was more than three times as much as men before the pandemic, I assure you that number has at least doubled,"" says Ms Bhatia. Though the 38 surveys carried out by UN Women primarily focused on lower and middle-income countries, data from more industrialised countriesshow a similar picture,external. ""More alarming is the fact that many women are actually not going back to work,"" says Ms Bhatia. ""In the month of September alone, in the US, something like 865,000 women dropped out of the labour force compared to 200,000 men, and most of that can be explained by the fact that there was a care burden and there's nobody else around."" UN Women warns that the ripple effect from having fewer working women will be dire on not only women's wellbeing but their economic progress and independence. BBC 100 Women has spoken to three women, looking at how the pandemic has impacted the amount of work they do. They were asked to keep a time diary, noting down how they used the hours in a typical day, covering a 24-hour-period. 'I reached my limit almost every day, my daughter would be crying and then I'd be crying.' Even before the pandemic, women in Japan spent on average almost five times longer than men on unpaid care work and chores. Teni Wada is a brand consultant based in Tokyo and was working a part-time nursery teacher before lockdown began. ""It's 5am and I'm desperately trying to complete this article on sake. The deadline isn't for a few days, but I like to stay ahead of the game. 'Mum life' is unpredictable, and I don't want this unpredictability to cost me a pay cheque,"" she writes in her diary. Teni says time is a luxury she doesn't have in between home-schooling, planning meals, working and doing the laundry. During lockdown, Teni and her husband have both been working from home, but their days look very different. ""He works from 9.30am to around 5-6.30pm, and I do feel like he has the luxury of going into a room and can concentrate on his work, but I don't have that luxury, she says, ""I do feel it's a bit unfair."" At home, Teni says she does around 80% of the unpaid work which includes home-schooling her three-year-old daughter. ""The first two-three months were awful, mentally I reached my limit almost every day, my daughter would be crying and then I'd be crying,"" she recalls. ""We are seeing worrying impacts, including high levels of stress and mental health challenges, particularly for women, partly as a result of the increased workloads,"" says Papa Seck, Chief Statistician at UN Women. 'The days are very exhausting in the field, at least for me, because I have other tasks in the house.' Delina Velasquez is a farmer from the Cercado province in the southern city of Tarija in Bolivia. Her days usually start around 5am, and she splits most of her time between working in the greenhouse and housework. But every two months she travels to the city's farmers' market to sell the vegetables she's been growing. ""The days are very exhausting in the field, at least for me, because I have other tasks in the house, but for now my daughter helps me, she is my right hand. She helps me in the house, in the field, in the greenhouse,"" she says. Traditional gender norms reinforce the idea that men are the breadwinners while women are the homemakers, and girls are often expected to take on housework. ""When it comes to children's assistance [in unpaid work], parents are more likely to cite help from daughters than sons,"" says Mr Seck. But Delina is happy that she gets to spend more time with her family during the pandemic. ""Before, I had to do everything alone in the nursery, buying seeds, storing, propagating, watering, cooking, cleaning,"" she says. ""But now that the school year has closed, my daughter helps me with cleaning, cooking, washing clothes; my little boy helps me in the nursery, my husband spends more time with us and helps us in everything he can. It's more relaxing for me."" 'My mind is always thinking about things he doesn't think about' Dr Ijeoma Kola is a Nigerian-American woman living in Nairobi, Kenya. She says part of the reason she has been able to juggle becoming a new mum and her job is because her husband is supportive and they can afford to hire someone to help them at home. ""Not all women have that, or are an economic position where they can afford help. But I still wake up every day at 6 or 7 to nurse our son,"" she says. Ijeoma says society is not economically set up in favour of women and instils gender norms that make it impossible for the average women to be able to have it all. ""Women can have it all, but not all at the same time and not without major sacrifices,"" she explains. ""I think that they're probably very few of us and I count myself very lucky to be able to have most things, if not everything."" Being able to hire someone to help out, made lockdown a bit easier for Ijeoma and her family. ""There was about a month where it was just us and I was miserable,"" she says. ""I felt like I just had so much work to do and couldn't get any professional work done because I was doing so much household work."" Although her husband is a good partner when it comes to parenting and takes the lead on things like cleaning, dishes, and laundry, she says she often feels that the responsibility of managing the home falls on her. ""My mind is always thinking about things he doesn't think about like the grocery list, our son's first birthday, whether we should take family photos for the holidays, or scheduling a Zoom hangout with friends,"" she says. The mental load - having to juggle things like healthcare appointments, meal plans and house repairs - can take a toll on women's physical and mental health as well. Women's unpaid work often covers the cost of care that sustains families, supports economies and fills in for the lack of social services, but it's rarely officially recognised as work. ""The key point here is that this has always been undervalued and it has always been treated as something that you didn't have to worry about because there wasn't compensation involved,"" says Ms Bhatia. ""The pandemic has shone a spotlight on the fact that unpaid work has really been the social safety net for the world and has made it possible for others to go out and earn a productive income, while actually hampering the growth opportunities and the employment opportunities of those women who are carrying the care burden."" Women who do the bulk of unpaid work will either have less time to engage in paid labour, or work longer hours, and often face financial insecurity either way. ""You cannot underscore enough how big a problem this is and how big an impact it's going to have if governments and businesses don't do something,"" says Ms Bhatia. The UN is calling on governments and businesses to acknowledge that unpaid work exists and implement measures such as extra family leave, or extra paid leave, and keeping childcare centres open. ""This is not just a question of rights, it's also a question of what makes economic sense,"" says Ms Bhatia. ""And it makes economic sense that women participate fully in the economy,"" Additional reporting by Will Dahlgreen and illustrations by Sana Jasemi.

"The Ischgl resort in Austria was linked to outbreaks earlier this year Germany is seeking an agreement with EU countries to keep ski resorts closed until early January, in an attempt to curb the spread of coronavirus. Chancellor Angela Merkel told parliament that efforts were being made to reach a Europe-wide decision. Italy and France have expressed support for a co-ordinated approach. But Austria has voiced concern. Some of the early European coronavirus hotspots were at ski resorts, helping spread infections across the continent. Last week, the World Health Organization (WHO) warned that Europe faced a ""tough"" six months , amid mounting cases. Renewed restrictions have led to a reduction in new infections in some countries, but there are fears the pandemic could worsen over the winter. How Europeans are preparing to celebrate Christmas Like Germany, Italy has also stressed the need for a united approach on the issue of ski resorts, and Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte has already backed delaying the start of the ski season. ""If Italy decided to shut down all its ski lifts without any support from France, Austria and the other countries, then Italian tourists would risk going abroad and taking the contagion back home,"" he told La7 TV earlier this week. Many Italians head for the slopes over the Christmas and New Year break and the period is a vital part of the local economy for ski resorts across Europe. French President Emmanuel Macron has made clear that the country's ski resorts will stay shut until the New Year. Prime Minister Jean Castex said on Thursday he wanted to see the coronavirus rules for ski resorts ""harmonised at European level as much as possible"". France plans to ease its current national lockdown in three phases through to the end of January. Most restrictions will be eased for a few days over Christmas. Mr Castex said ""this family celebration cannot take place without grandparents being present"". But Austria has voiced concern over any EU-wide plan for ski resorts, with Finance Minister Gernot BlÃ¼mel saying that if the EU forced the resorts to remain closed, ""then they will have to pay for it"". Compensation would run into billions of euros. Austria's government is already facing legal action over the Ischgl ski village, which was linked to cases in 45 countries after skiers brought the virus home with them. This video can not be played How close are we to Covid immunisation? Switzerland is not in the European Union and, unlike other Alpine destinations, its ski resorts are already open, so skiers unable to spend their winter breaks in neighbouring countries could head there instead. Ski lifts are running, with a requirement to wear masks, prompting criticism from WHO Covid-19 envoy David Nabarro. ""Once infection rates sink, and they will sink, then we can be as free as we want. But right now? Should ski resorts open? Under what conditions?"" 'Momentous' errors in ski resort Covid outbreak Meanwhile, Mrs Merkel has also defended the decision to extend Germany's partial lockdown until 20 December, announced on Wednesday. The stricter rules will limit private gatherings to five people from two households coming into effect from next week - although children under the age of 14 are exempt. German leaders have also unveiled plans for Christmas, with meetings of up to 10 people allowed from 23 December until 1 January. Addressing the Bundestag - Germany's lower house - on Thursday, Mrs Merkel said the tight restrictions must remain for now because the goal was still to get down to a maximum weekly rate of 50 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants. But in 62 areas, including Berlin, the figure was above 200, she said. ""Unfortunately we have to say that we cannot promise any relief for Christmas and the New Year,"" the chancellor said.

"Paul Farrell is alleged to have targeted victims between 1985 and 2018 An ex-porter at London's Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children has been accused of nearly 80 sex offences. Paul Farrell, 55, is alleged to have targeted seven victims between 1985 and 2018, the Met Police said. The 79 charges against Mr Farrell, of Camden, north London, include rape, attempted rape, and sexual assault of a child under 13. He was remanded in custody and is due before Wood Green Magistrates' Court later, the Met said. News of the charges against Mr Farrell emerged when the hospital issued a statement on Wednesday ""regarding media stories about a former member of staff"". Police said he was originally arrested on 16 January and made an appearance at Highbury Magistrates' Court after being charged. An ongoing investigation is being led by officers from the Met's Central North Command Unit safeguarding team. In its statement, the hospital said: ""These are truly awful charges and we know that our hospital community, including our patient families, will have concerns or questions. ""Due to the ongoing legal proceedings, we cannot go into the details of the case, but we can confirm that the individual who has been charged was dismissed from the trust and we are continuing to work closely with the police. ""Safeguarding children is fundamental to the care we provide and our policies are in line with national best practice. ""If patients, their families or colleagues raise concerns about staff there is a clear and swift process to manage these concerns when they are raised.

"Diego Maradona (centre) and Ossie Ardiles (right) played together at the 1982 World Cup Today's football superstars Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo ""could not even dream"" of being admired as much as Diego Maradona was, says his former Argentina team-mate Ossie Ardiles. Three days of national mourning have begun in Argentina after Maradonadied on Wednesdayat the age of 60. His body will lie in state at the Casa Rosada, the presidential palace in Buenos Aires, during that time. ""To be Diego Maradona was incredibly beautiful,"" Ardiles told the BBC. ""But on the other hand, it was not easy at all. Right from a really early age, he was subject to the press all the time. He didn't have a normal childhood, he never had normal teenage years. ""Everybody wanted to be with him, everybody wanted a piece of him, so it was incredibly difficult."" How Maradona's tormenting of England made him an Argentine deity Obituary - Argentina's flawed football icon An extraordinary life in pictures Football Daily podcast: Remembering Diego Maradona Maradona, who played for clubs including Barcelona and Napoli, was captain when Argentina won the 1986 World Cup, scoring the famous 'Hand of God' goal against England in the quarter-finals. Former Tottenham midfielder Ardiles, who played alongside Maradona at the 1982 World Cup, said he was ""a god"" in Argentina, in Naples and all around the world. ""He will be remembered as a genius in football,"" he added. ""You can see the extraordinary amount of interest that he generates. ""People like [Juventus and Portugal striker] Ronaldo, or people like [Barcelona and Argentina forward] Messi, they couldn't even dream of having this kind of admiration. ""That was the Maradona phenomenon - all the time."" A post-mortem examination was due to take place on Maradona's body later on Wednesday after he died at about midday local time at his home in Tigre, near Buenos Aires. The former Argentina attacking midfielder and manager had successful surgery on a brain blood clot earlier in November and was to be treated for alcohol dependency. This video can not be played Watch all of Maradona's World Cup goals A minute's silence took place before Wednesday's Champions League matches and the same will happen before all other European fixtures this week. Messi and Ronaldo were among current players to pay tribute, while Brazilian football great Pele said he hoped one day they would ""play ball together in the sky"". Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola said Maradona ""made world football better"". ""There was a banner in Argentina, one year ago, that I read that said: 'No matter what you have done with your life, Diego, it matters what you do for our lives,'"" former Barcelona and Bayern Munich boss Guardiola added. ""It expresses perfectly what this guy gave us. The man of joy and pleasure and his commitment for world football."" Former Tottenham manager and Argentina defender Mauricio Pochettino said: ""Broken with pain. Diego, you were my hero and friend. I was so fortunate to have shared football and life with you."" The Vatican said Pope Francis, an Argentine and a football fan, would be remembering Maradona in his prayers. Allow Instagram content? This article contains content provided by Instagram.

In Argentina, Wednesday's match between Sport Club Internacional and Maradona's former club Boca Juniors was postponed. Fans flocked to La Bombonera, Boca Juniors' stadium in Buenos Aires, where many were in tears - despite, in the case of some, being too young to remember Maradona's playing days. They also congregated in the San Andres neighbourhood, where Maradona lived, and to La Plata, where he most recently was manager of local club Gimnasia y Esgrima. In the country's capital, ""gracias Diego"" replaced train information on digital metro signs, while fans sang La Mano De Dios (The Hand Of God) in city suburbs. Thousands of miles away, they also gathered outside Napoli's San Paolo stadium, which was lit up in tribute to the man who scored 81 goals in 188 appearances for the Italian club. Fireworks erupted in the sky as those below, clad in Maradona shirts and even Maradona face masks, chanted and wept. Maradona wasn't just a sportsman for Argentinians, he was an icon, a political player and of course, a loveable rogue. There is deep sadness as people prepare to pay their respects to their superstar footballer. But his influence goes beyond Argentina - South Americans are proud of their footballing heritage so this news has resonated across the region. In neighbouring Brazil, where their man Pele vied for the title of world's best footballer, Maradona's death was headline news - much of the rivalry between the two countries can be put down to the two players, such is the passion for the beautiful game here. But rivalry was put aside with Pele paying tribute to Maradona as a dear friend. ""One day, I hope, we will have a kick about together in heaven,"" he said. A statement from Napoli said: ""Everyone is waiting for our words but what words could we possibly use for a pain such as this that we are going through? ""Now is the moment for tears. Then there will be the moment for words. ""We are in mourning. We feel like a boxer who has been knocked out. We are in shock. A devastating blow for both city and club."" A day of mourning will take place in Naples on Thursday. The mayor of the city, Luigi de Magistris, has called for the Stadio San Paolo be renamed in honour of Maradona. This video can not be played The night Maradona took on Italy in Naples Speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live's Football Daily podcast, Paul Elliott, who played against Maradona while at Pisa, said: ""I have to say it was remarkable. There was a sublime talent that this man had, an aura, a presence, and you know when you feel a sense of energy. ""Napoli is a very poor part of the south of Italy, but their whole world was built around Maradona and Napoli. ""If you look at where the club was when he arrived, the impact of one man unequivocally was the key and the catalyst to the success that they had, and the way he just gave everybody hope. ""That was just by his remarkable, sublime talent.""

"The covid crisis is on track to cut average pay packets by Â£1,200 a year by 2025, according to new analysis. The prediction comes from the Resolution Foundation, a think tank focused on improving living standards for people on low-to-middle incomes. It comes a day after Chancellor Rishi Sunak warned unemployment could surge to 2.6 million by mid-2021. The economic downturn will continue to squeeze living standards in Britain warned the foundation. ""The Covid crisis is causing immense damage to the public finances, and permanent damage to family finances too, with pay packets on track to be Â£1,200 a year lower than pre-pandemic expectations,"" warned Torsten Bell, chief executive of the Resolution Foundation. Rishi Sunak warns 'economic emergency has only just begun' Spending Review: Unemployed predicted to rise to 2.6 million Coronavirus: Retail workers 'scared' as cases surge Its new research published on Thursday, Here Today, Gone Tomorrow, says that ""the combined effects of weaker pay growth and higher unemployment will serve to prolong Britain's living standards squeeze"". Its analysis shows household incomes have been growing at a slower pace even before the pandemic. They are on course to grow just 10% during the 15 years from the start of the 2008 global financial crisis until 2023. But household incomes grew by a much higher 40% in the 15 years leading up to the financial crisis. This video can not be played What you need to know about Chancellor Rishi Sunak's speech â in two minutes The Resolution Foundation says further pressure will come next April, when about six million households will lose more than Â£1,000 through reduced Universal Credit payments. It also warned the bulk of the government's extra spending to deal with the ""economic emergency"" will need to come from tax rises. ""While the priority now is to support the economy, the permanent damage to the public finances mean taxes will rise in future,"" added Mr Bell. ""The pandemic is just the latest of three 'once in a lifetime' economic shocks the UK experienced in a little over a decade, following the financial crisis and Brexit,"" he added. ""The result is an unprecedented 15-year living standards squeeze."" In Mr Sunak's Spending Review he pledged Â£280bn this year to help get the country through the pandemic downturn. ""But which taxes those will be, like which Brexit we can expect, are questions the chancellor left for another day.""

"This video can not be played Health Secretary Matt Hancock sets out England's new coronavirus tier system Most of England will be in the two toughest levels of measures when the national lockdown ends next week. The new coronavirus tier restrictions will mean 55 million people remain banned from mixing with other households indoors from 2 December. Large parts of the Midlands, North East and North West, including Manchester, as well as Kent, are in tier three. A majority of places are in the second highest level - tier two - including London, and Liverpool city region.

He told the Commons: ""Hope is on the horizon but we still have further to go. So we must all dig deep."" Mr Hancock added that people ""should see these restrictions not as a boundary to push but as a limit on what the public health advice says we can safely do in any area."" Around 23 million people across 21 local authority areas will be in the highest level - tier three - including Birmingham, Leeds, Sheffield, Tees Valley Combined Authority and North East Combined Authority. Lancashire, Leicester, Lincolnshire, Slough, Bristol, Kent and Medway will also be in tier three. Earlier, a rush for details of the tier allocations saw the government website repeatedly crash. On Thursday, another 498 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were reported in the UK, and a further 17,555 positive cases,the latest figures showed.,external Differences between the new tiers include restrictions on where households can meet up: tier one: the rule of six applies everywhere, indoors and out tier two: the rule of six applies outdoors but there is no household mixing anywhere indoors tier three: can only meet other households in outdoor public spaces like parks, where the rule of six applies Gyms and close-contact beauty services like hairdressers will be able to open in all tiers. Guidance said people in all tiers who can work from home, should continue to do so. Pubs in tier two can only open to serve ""substantial meals"", while those in tier three can only operate as a takeaway or delivery service. Hospitality bossessaid nearly nine in 10 venues believed they""are not viable to operate"" within tiers two and three. Make no mistake, this is only a gradual step out of lockdown. At the start of November nearly half the country was in tier one, meaning households could mix indoors in people's homes and in pubs and restaurants as long as they kept to the rule of six. Now that is only possible in Cornwall, the Isle of Wight and Isles of Scilly. Infection rates are showing early signs of coming down, but the government is erring on the side of caution. Research suggests they were too slow to put areas in higher tiers before lockdown. They do not want to make that mistake again - and so are starting off high in the hope they can move areas down the tiers. But it is not only about which area is in which tier. The top two tiers have been beefed up, particularly in regards to hospitality. One ray of hope, the government says, is the experience of Liverpool. Before lockdown it was in tier three and seeing among the highest infection rates in the country. Today it has now been put in tier two with infection levels pretty close to the national average. BBC analysis showed 713,573 people live in the new tier one areas, 32.2 million in tier two, and 23.3 million in tier three. This is compared to 23.5 million in tier one pre-lockdown, 24 million in tier two, and 8.7 million in tier three. The new tier restrictions will be voted on by MPs next week, with the government already facing opposition from its own backbenchers. Leading Conservative MP Sir Graham Brady told BBC Radio 4's World at One he would vote against the measures, saying: ""I do think that the policies have been far too authoritarian."" And former Brexit minister Steve Baker, deputy chairman of the recently-formed Covid Recovery Group (CRG), called for the government to publish analysis - ahead of the vote - of the impact restrictions were likely to have on controlling Covid, as well as the non-Covid health impact and the effect on ""society, people's livelihoods and businesses"". He said he was ""open"" to supporting measures ""where it can clearly be demonstrated that the government intervention will save more lives than it costs"". Meanwhile, there was a mixed reaction from regional leaders following the announcement of tier allocations. MPs and businesses in Cornwallexpressed ""huge relief""at being one of only three areas in England to be placed in tier one. Mayor of Liverpool Joe Anderson saidthe city region's move from tier three to tier twowas the result of ""hard work, dedication and sacrifice"". He said: ""We embraced tier three restrictions and worked fast to deliver the testing pilot, bringing in the Army to help us deliver an efficient service."" And Mayor of London Sadiq Khan saidthe decision to place the capital in the second highest level - tier two- was the result of people's ""monumental sacrifice"" and would be a ""welcome boost"" for businesses. This video can not be played Bar chain owner Martin Greenhow: ''This is pure and simple business torture"" But there wasanger among politicians in Lancashirethat the whole county had been placed into the highest tier of restrictions, after council leaders asked for it to be split into different tiers to reflect varying rates. Elsewhere, Leicester MPs and businesses said the city's tier three restrictions were ""extremely difficult to hear""following 150 days of lockdown. And Greater Manchester's mayor, Andy Burnham, said he hoped the regionwould be moved down from tier threein a couple of weeks. MASS TESTING:Where is it available? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? SCHOOLS:What will happen if children catch coronavirus? TESTING:How do I get a virus test? Decisions on tiers are based on public health recommendations informed by a series of public health data, including Covid-19 cases among the over-60s, positivity rates, pressure on the NHS and how quickly cases are rising or falling. Areas placed in tier three will be eligible for rapid or ""lateral flow"" tests - which give results in about 20 minutes without the need for a lab - to help bring down infections and reduce restrictions. And they will be offered support by NHS Test and Trace and the armed forces to deliver a six-week rapid community testing programme. Devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have the power to set their own coronavirus regulations, though all four UK nations have agreeda joint plan for Christmas.

"This video can not be played Health Secretary Matt Hancock sets out England's new coronavirus tier system Most of England will be in the two toughest levels of measures when the national lockdown ends next week. The new coronavirus tier restrictions will mean 55 million people remain banned from mixing with other households indoors from 2 December. Large parts of the Midlands, North East and North West, including Manchester, as well as Kent, are in tier three. A majority of places are in the second highest level - tier two - including London, and Liverpool city region.

"Christmas ""bubbles"" of three households in Scotland should contain no more than eight people over the age of 11, the Scottish government has said. The rule is part of thegovernment's guidance for Christmas,externalwhich temporarily relaxes some Covid-19 restrictions for five days. Children under the age of 12 will not count towards the total number of people in the bubble. The easing of Covid rules will apply across the UK from 23 to 27 December. Opposition parties have accused the Scottish government of sending out ""mixed messages"" by allowing people to meet at Christmas while simultaneously urging them not to do so. And many health experts have warned that the move is likely to lead to a spike in cases of the virus - and potentially deaths - in January UK governmentguidance for people in England,externaldoes not set a limit on the number of people in a bubble, but says this should be kept ""as small as possible"". What are the rules for forming bubbles at Christmas? No separate guidance has been published for Wales or Northern Ireland at this stage, although people can travel to or from Northern Ireland on 22 and 28 December. The NI executive ismeeting on Thursdayto discuss the rules. A UK-wide deal was agreed on Tuesday to permit people to meet up in ""bubbles"" over the festive period. Travel restrictions will be lifted across all four nations from 23 to 27 December so people can visit close friends and relatives. But Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has that said the ""default advice"" and ""safest position"" was still that people should avoid contact. Single households should not travel in or out of level three or level four areas to stay in tourist accommodation The Scottish guidance states that the ""safest way to spend Christmas and the festive period is to stay within your own household, in your own home and your own local area"". It adds: ""Wherever possible you should keep in touch with friends and family members from other households through technology - or, if you decide to meet in person, you should minimise the numbers and duration, and if possible meet out of doors. ""Consider a Christmas walk with family, rather than a meal indoors."" This video can not be played How you and your family can celebrate Christmas and minimise the spread of coronavirus Although three households will be allowed to meet indoors and stay overnight in the same home, the Scottish government says a two-metre distance should be kept between people from different households. However, children under 12 will be exempt from the physical distancing rules. Other guidance for different households staying in the same home includes: Avoiding sharing cutlery or crockery Washing your hands frequently Cleaning ""touch points"" regularly, such as door handles and surface Doors and windows should also be opened to let in as much fresh air as possible during and after visits. Christmas bubbles in Scotland can only gather in a private home, outdoors or at a place of worship. They will not be allowed to visit pubs, restaurants or go to shops together and staying in tourist accommodation as a group is banned as well. Single households should also not travel in or out of level three or level four areas in Scotland to use tourist accommodation, the guidance says. Scottish Greens co-leader Patrick Harvie highlightedwarnings from public health expertsthat the easing of restrictions over Christmas was likely to lead to a third wave of infections, hospitals being overrun, more ""unnecessary"" deaths and potentially a nationwide lockdown in January. Speaking in the Holyrood chamber, Mr Harvie also questioned why the Scottish government had apparently not carried out any risk assessments on the potential impact of easing the restrictions. He added: ""I recognise that there were difficult judgements to make about relaxing the Covid rules over the holidays, especially after public expectations had been built up. ""But within a day of announcing the looser rules, the first minister is appealing to the public not to use them. It's a confusing message.""

"Six women in Northern Ireland have been murdered since 2015 despite previously reporting their violent partners to the police. One woman contacted the police eight times before she was killed, figures obtained by BBC News NI showed. The family of one of the women said tougher legislation is needed to protect women. A new bill to strengthen NI's domestic abuse legislation is currently being considered by the assembly. Police said they would welcome more protection in law for victims. Domestic abuse bill for NI closer to becoming law More than 50 domestic crimes a day in NI Connie Leonard wasmurdered at her home in in Maguiresbridge, County Fermanagh, in 2017. Her brother Fergal said police needed to be given stronger powers to tackle domestic violence. He told the BBC: ""There are a number of matters I feel that could have been acted on and may have saved Connie's life."" ""The last person in the world that I thought something would have happened to is Connie."" Ms Leonard and her son Conor, who has Down's syndrome, were attacked by 55-year-old Peadar Phair, a former partner of Ms Leonard. She had reported Phair three times before she was murdered and she had taken out a non-molestation order against him. Phair later took his own life. Connie Leonard was stabbed to death in front of her son Police, Mr Leonard said, must ""know what their powers are and that they use these powers effectively"". There must be ""proper monitoring and following up"" and officers must know ""what actions they are supposed to take"". The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI), which released the figures to the BBC following a freedom of information request, said it would welcome more protection in law for victims of domestic abuse. Det Ch Insp Lindsay Fisher said: ""In terms of legislation, police are very much bound by and uphold the law. ""Therefore we are always acting within the law in terms of our response to domestic abuse matters or any other crime. ""Police would welcome any further legislation that would support victims of domestic abuse and would seek to bring offenders to justice."" Det Ch Insp Fisher urged anyone suffering from abuse to ""reach out to police or to a family member"". She added: ""The PSNI is here to help victims of domestic abuse and we do have enhanced support services in place."" Justice Minister Naomi Long said the process of strengthening NI's laws is under way. She said she was considering the introduction of Domestic Violence Protection Orders, which allow police in other parts of the UK to intervene where they believe a person to be at risk, but do not have enough evidence to bring a criminal charge. She said: ""I have signed off last night on a consultation process on domestic abuse protection notices and orders. That will happen over the next number of weeks."" Naomi Long said the process of strengthening NI's laws is under way Separately, a bill to strengthen domestic abuse legislationreturns to Stormont in December. It will mean domestic abuse offences in Northern Ireland will no longer be limited to physically violent behaviour. It will make a form of bullying, known as coercive control, an offence in Northern Ireland for the first time. Convictions for the most serious domestic abuse offences will carry a penalty of up to 14 years in jail. Sonya McMullan from Woman's Aid Northern Ireland said  police need ""more robust powers"" in relation to domestic abuse. He said: ""Legislation which is in other parts of the UK is not here in Northern Ireland. ""That is just not good enough in regard to protection orders and emergency orders that would give the police more powers to remove the perpetrator and to get an order themselves.

"Designs for the co-living development have been revealed as part of a digital consultation Plans for a 30-storey tower block in Glasgow city centre are being unveiled as part of a public consultation. Developers Watkin Jones Group are proposing to demolish Portcullis House on India Street at Charing Cross to make way for the new structure. The firm plans to construct a build-to-rent and co-living development comprising 825 units, including shops, a cafe and a co-working space. If delivered, the development could be the tallest building in Glasgow. Co-living is a community-based housing model with shared communal areas, amenities and even meals. Portcullis House was built in the 1970s and later became home to HM Revenue and Customs. Student flats operator 'put profit over safety' Asylum seekers may be in hotels until end of year Why stricter rules for Glasgow but not for Edinburgh? Full details on the proposal go live at 09:00 via theproject website,external. With public consultations suspended because of the pandemic, a digital consultation event will be held between 15:00 and 20:00. Any suggestions for changes during the public consultation will be included in a report accompanying future applications. The developers purchased Portcullis House in August 2020 Watkin Jones Group has submitted a proposal of application notice (PAN) to Glasgow City Council, informing of their intent to submit a planning application following a consultation period of at least 12 weeks. It purchased Portcullis House in August 2020 after the office block was put up for sale in May. The firm said that subject to planning, the development will be completed in 2024. The proposed tower block would be considerable taller than nearby buildings Iain Smith, Group Planning Director from Watkin Jones, said: ""We're thrilled to be giving the public the chance to view our proposals for Portcullis House and provide feedback. ""BTR and co-living offer high-quality rented accommodation at competitive prices to a wide-ranging demographic. There is huge demand in Glasgow for this model which offers long-term security of tenure, combined with the flexibility of renting.""

"Police Federation chairman John Apter called the pay freeze a ""disgrace"" Union leaders have reacted with fury after Chancellor Rishi Sunak imposed a pay freeze on at least 1.3 million public sector workers. The GMB union said it had fought a public sector pay cap before ""and we busted it"", while the civil service and rail unions warned of strike action. Frontline NHS staff and lower paid workers will get pay rises, Mr Sunak said in Wednesday's Spending Review. But Mr Sunak said rises for others in the public sector were being ""paused."" This includes civil servants, teachers, police, firefighters, the armed forces, and council staff Rehana Azam, national officer of the GMB union, said the freeze ""will hit key workers who have risked everything during the pandemic"". ""This attempt to divide and rule will put him on a direct collision course with public service workers, and he should know that we fought the public sector pay cap before and we busted it,"" she said. ""GMB will not accept more pay cuts for our members at a time when the whole country is relying on them. Economic emergency has only just begun, says Sunak Low-paid public sector workers to get Â£250 pay rise Millions face cut in value of company pensions Mark Serwotka, general secretary of the Public and Commercial Services union (PCS) said: ""Civil servants and other public sector staff will feel a deep sense of betrayal at today's pay freeze. ""Despite keeping the country running during the Covid crisis, supplying Universal Credit and helping businesses access the furlough scheme, the chancellor has justified a pay freeze by pointing to lower wages in the private sector."" He said the news ""has intensified long-standing anger at a decade of pay restraint and increased the likelihood of industrial unrest in the public sector."" Mick Cash, leader of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union (RMT), also warned that members will ""have no hesitation in taking strike action"", while Unison general secretary Dave Prentis said: ""This is austerity, plain and simple."" Rishi Sunak said he was targeting resources at those who needed it most Other union leaders also lined up to condemn the freeze, including Unite, Prospect, and the Fire Brigades Union. The Treasury has estimated that the pay announcement will directly affect 1.3 million workers, less than 25% of the total number of 5.5 million in the public sector. However, that figure mainly covers people working for central government. The total rise could be much higher if local government and devolved pay agreements are frozen. In his Spending Review, Mr Sunak highlighted a disparity between public sector and private sector wages, adding he ""cannot justify a significant, across-the-board"" pay increase for all public sector workers in the circumstances. ""Instead, we are targeting our resources at those who need it most,"" he said. He said 2.1 million public sector workers earning below the median wage of Â£24,000 were ""guaranteed a pay rise of at least Â£250"". More than a million NHS workers will also get a raise, he said. Meanwhile, the National Living Wage will increase by 2.2% - or 19p - to Â£8.91 an hour, with the rate extended to 23 and 24 year olds for the first time.

"This video can not be played Iran TV shows release of Kylie Moore-Gilbert in exchange for three Iranians imprisoned abroad (November 2020 report) A British-Australian academic who has been freed from jail in Iran has thanked supporters for getting her through ""a long and traumatic ordeal"". Kylie Moore-Gilbert has consistently denied accusations of espionage since her arrest in Iran in September 2018. She had been serving a 10-year sentence but was released in a swap for three jailed Iranians, Tehran said. Dr Moore-Gilbert's family said they were ""relieved and ecstatic"" that she was free. The Melbourne University lecturer had been travelling on an Australian passport in 2018 when she was detained at Tehran airport as she tried to leave following a conference. Concerns for her wellbeing escalated in August when news emerged that she had been transferred to Qarchak, a notorious prison in the desert. On Thursday, Dr Moore-Gilbert said Australian officials had worked ""tirelessly"" to secure her freedom. She thanked them and other supporters who had ""meant the world to me"" while in detention. Kylie Moore-Gilbert was reported to have been on several hunger strikes while in Evin prison in Tehran ""I have nothing but respect, love and admiration for the great nation of Iran and its warm-hearted, generous and brave people,"" she said in a statement. ""It is with bittersweet feelings that I depart your country, despite the injustices which I have been subjected to. I came to Iran as a friend and with friendly intentions, and depart Iran with those sentiments not only still intact, but strengthened."" Iran rejects appeal over doctor sentenced to death Jailed academic 'rejected Iran's offer to be spy' The Cambridge-educated scholar - who was tried in secret - had endured ""over 800 days of incredible hardship"", her family added. ""We cannot convey the overwhelming happiness that each of us feel at this incredible news,"" they said in a statement released by the Australian government. According to Iranian state media, she was exchanged for an Iranian businessman and two Iranian citizens ""who had been detained abroad"". They have not yet been named. Video of the apparent exchange was published by state broadcaster IRIB news and the Tasnim website. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The footage, which had no commentary, showed Dr Moore-Gilbert wearing a grey hijab and being driven away in a mini-van. Three men are seen being met by officials. One is in a wheelchair. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison declined to comment on whether a swap had taken place, but said no-one had been released in Australia. ""The injustice of her detention and her conviction, Australia has always rejected, and I'm just so pleased that Kylie's coming home,"" he told local network Nine. In letters smuggled out of Tehran's Evin prison earlier this year, Dr Moore-Gilbert said she had ""never been a spy"" and feared for her mental health. She said she had rejected an offer from Iran to become a spy. ""I am not a spy. I have never been a spy, and I have no interest to work for a spying organisation in any country,"" she wrote. She was later visited by Australia's ambassador to Iran, Lyndall Sachs, who reported that she was ""well"". Dr Moore-Gilbert was reported to have spent long periods in solitary confinement and undertaken hunger strikes while in detention. Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne said the release ""was achieved through diplomatic engagement with the Iranian government"". She added Dr Moore-Gilbert would ""soon be reunited with her family"" but did not specify when she would be returning to Australia. Melbourne University Vice-Chancellor Duncan Maskell said he was ""delighted"" at the news, adding: ""We have waited a long time for this day."" Iran has detained a number of foreign nationals and Iranian dual citizens in recent years, many of them on spying charges. Human rights groups have accused Tehran of using the cases as leverage to try to gain concessions from other countries. British-Iranian charity worker Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe was jailed on spying charges in 2016. She has always maintained her innocence. This video can not be played Why one mother's personal plight is part of a complicated history between Iran and the UK (video published August 2019 and last updated in October 2019) Her husband, Richard Ratcliffe, welcomed reports of Dr Moore-Gilbert's release. ""Nazanin and I are really happy for Kylie and her family,"" he told the BBC. ""They have been through so much, borne with such dignity. And it is an early Christmas present for us all, that one more of us is out and on their way home, one more family can begin to heal."" Kate Allen, director of Amnesty International UK, said news of Dr Moore-Gilbert's release was ""an enormous relief"". ""There may now be renewed grounds for hoping that UK-Iranian dual-nationals like Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and Anoosheh Ashoori will also be released from their unjust jail terms in Iran in the coming days or weeks,"" she said. Anoosheh Ashoori, a retired civil engineer from London, was jailed for 10 years in July 2019 after being convicted of spying for Israel's Mossad intelligence agency.

"New tough measures for England are the best way of avoiding another national lockdown, PM Boris Johnson tells a No 10 briefing England faces a ""hard winter"" but we must suppress the virus until vaccines ""come to our aid"", he says Chief Scientific Adviser Sir Patrick Vallance says the number of UK cases is still high but have started to ""turn the corner"" New coronavirus tier arrangements for England have been set out by the health secretary in the Commons They mean 55 million people will be in tiers 2 or 3 and remain banned from mixing with other households indoors after 2 December Elsewhere, in a Thanksgiving speech, US President-elect Joe Biden says ""we're at war with a virus, not with one another"" There have been more than 60 million coronavirus cases and 1.4 million deaths across the globe, according to Johns Hopkins University Edited by Sarah Fowler and Martha Buckley Many thanks for joining us today. The live page coverage has been brought to you by: Martha Buckley, Alice Evans, Sarah Fowler, Becky Morton, Mal Siret, Lauren Turner and Kate Whannel.

Read more here. Danny AeberhardEurope regional editor, BBC World Service The Museum of London has launched an unusual project to capture how the coronavirus pandemic is affecting Londoners' lives - by collecting their dreams. The museum is working with researchers on dreams at a Canadian research institute. Sigmund Freud described dreams as the ""guardians of sleep"" - a description used as the name of the project, which the Museum of London says is the first of its kind. It seeks to document the effects of the pandemic on the subconscious of Londoners, as they work through some of the struggles and anxieties of the crisis in their sleep. The curator, Foteini Aravani, says people's testimonies will help to provide a more emotional and personal narrative for future generations. Just as many people might be feeling disappointed, frustrated and worried by the new tier system for England, so are MPs, with many in the House of Commons feeling the same way, says BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg. Some of the government's own Conservative MPs might even vote against the plan when it goes before them in the middle of next week. But ""while it might be bumpy"", there is ""not a realistic chance"" of it being blocked in any way. ""Like it or not, this is what is due to come in next Wednesday as the government tries to get control of this disease,"" she adds. Ski lifts stand idle at the resort of Les Menuires in the French Alps Would-be skiers in France have been left baffled after the prime minister said that winter resorts could open in the Alps and Pyrenees for the Christmas period - but that ski lifts would have to remain shut. Jean Castex said that mountain holidays were still a possibility, but that skiing was effectively ruled out. Hotels at resorts would be able to open when the country's national lockdown is lifted on 15 December, he said, while bars and restaurants will remain shut until January at the earliest. French President Emmanuel Macron said earlier this week thatFrance's ski resorts may have to remain closed until next yearbecause the current risks associated with the virus made it difficult for such sports to resume. He said he would discuss the issue with other European leaders and keep the decision under review. Ski resorts were responsible for numerous outbreaks of Covid-19 cases across Europe in the early days of the pandemic. Italy, Austria and Germany have all ordered lifts - even the high-altitude ones - at ski resorts to remain closed for the time being. But Switzerland is allowing ski resorts to remain open as long as they have strict safety measures in place, the health minister said today. David PittamBBC News Online Lia
Primrose (pictured left) is studying health and social care at college. The 17-year-old said: ""It
just feels like a bit of a kick in the teeth after cases went down so much. I work as a waitress so it'll affect me - I can't go back to work now. ""We
watched the announcement in class and he actually said tier two first, then said 'Oh sorry, tier three.' It was the biggest heartbreak. ""My age group is in a
weird place - we're at an age where we're expected to get Christmas presents for
people but we don't have the money because we can't work."" Her classmate, Poppi West, also 17, added:"" It's annoying that we keep going in and out - it feels like we're going round in circles. ""I know it's not the biggest issue but we're both nearly 18 and we won't be able to go out and have a drink to celebrate. It's just a bit sad."" Mass testing was piloted in Liverpool Liam Thorp of the Liverpool Echo asks whether Boris Johnson will increase funding for people who are self-isolating. He also notes that the city hasn't had the best relationship with the Conservatives in the past and asks the PM if he will remember Liverpool's efforts in the future when making funding decisions. ""What's happened in Liverpool has been fantastic,"" replies the prime minister. He says it is not just the testing programme but the way ""everyone pulled together to get the virus down"". ""We are going to keep supporting you throughout Covid and beyond,"" he promises. And that is the last question of today's press conference. Ben Glaze of the Daily Mirror asks if it is a good idea for people to be travelling across the country to hug and kiss elderly relatives. The PM says it has been an ""incredibly difficult decision"" as ministers have to balance people's strong desire to celebrate a family holiday - adding ""which frankly they're going do do anyway"" - and keeping the virus under control. He urges everyone to be ""commonsensical"" and ""do the right thing"". ""Until the vaccine comes on stream, we are not out of the woods yet and we have to be very, very vigilant,"" he adds. Prof Whitty says he would want people to see family, but adds: ""Would I encourage someone to hug and kiss elderly relatives? No, I would not."" He adds while it is not against the law, it does not make sense as you could be carrying the virus. ""The fact you can do something, doesn't mean you should."" Speaking of his own plans for Christmas, he says he will spend it on hospital wards. Sir Patrick Vallance says the key thing is to follow the basic rules of keeping distance where you can, keeping areas well-ventilated and so on. It will not be a normal Christmas and ""hugging elderly relatives is not something to do,"" he adds. They want to survive to be hugged again, adds Whitty.  This video can not be played Coronavirus: 'Take it really seriously during Christmas' Dominic Yeatman of the Metro asks if it is fair that pubs and restaurants forced to close will get support but the businesses that depend on them will not. He also asks if people will still stick to the rules if they believe the end of the virus is in sight. Boris Johnson says closed businesses do deserve protection and cites business grants and the furlough scheme as examples of government help. On the second question, Chris Whitty says he believes people will abide by the rules adding that the ""really heartening thing of this whole dreadful period"" has been the altruism, self-discipline and patience of the British public. ""You can always find some people who haven't followed the rules but they are in the minority,"" he says. Sky News's Beth Rigby asks about the loosening of restrictions over Christmas and whether a rise in cases is anticipated, leading to stricter rules before and afterwards. Prof Chris Whitty says Christmas will increase the risk: ""Everyone knows that, it's not a secret at all."" But it is not the only risk over this next period, he adds, with January and February the most difficult time for the NHS and a ""time of extreme pressure"". It is ""not the time of year where we want to be taking reckless decisions"" because ""things will be difficult for several months"", he adds. Christmas is an element of that but only one element. Christmas can be enjoyed without a spike in cases if people ""take it really seriously"" and ""don't do unnecessary things, just because you can"". People should ""take sensible precautions"", he adds. A number of Conservative MPs have lashed out at the introduction of new tiered Covid restrictions in England. The majority of the country will be placed in the two toughest levels when national lockdown ends on 2 December. The Covid Recovery Group, made up of Tory backbenchers, described the move as ""authoritarianism at work"". The group's deputy chair, Tory MP Steve Baker, called the announcement ""truly appalling"" and questioned if it was ""necessary and proportionate"" to the threat from coronavirus. The government has promised to publish an impact assessment early next week before MPs get a chance to vote on the new rules on Tuesday. But a revolt is brewing among the government's own MPs, including the chair of the influential 1922 committee of backbenchers, Sir Graham Brady. Read more. Military personnel helped at test sites in Liverpool Beth Rigby of Sky News asks how mass testing could be delivered to 40% of the population - asking if the whole British Army would have to be deployed. The PM replies he doesn't ""want to over-sell"" how easy it is to do it, and it ""depends on strong local leadership"" and ""real spirit"" in the local community. It is also ""only part of the panoply of interventions you need to defeat the disease"", he adds. The Army will help and support where necessary, but the key thing is local leaders saying they want the mass testing and the ""local will"" for it to be done. There will be ""adequate personnel"" and there are ""huge stocks"" of the lateral flow tests themselves right now, says Boris Johnson, adding there is hope they'll be made in the UK eventually.  ITV's Robert Peston asks the PM whether he will have to raise taxes and cut spending as a result of the pandemic. He also asks why the government's ""whack-a-mole"" strategy ""didn't work"". On the economy, Boris Johnson says his government is taking steps to ensure the country can ""bounce back from Covid"". ""It will need fiscal prudence - and that you will get from this government,"" he adds. On the lockdown strategy, Chris Whitty says, ""There are tiers that would work in the spring and summer which I would not expect to work at this stage."" Patrick Vallance says implementing weaker restrictions now would mean the government would have to resort to ""much more drastic measures"" later on. ""Madness is doing the same thing twice and expecting different results,"" Whitty adds. Chris MasonPolitical Correspondent The news conference can be summed up like this: the scientists say cases will rise in tier one, they'll hold steady in tier two and they'll fall under tier three. The prime minister wants to offer hope: ""Your tier is not your destiny,"" he says, and, ""By April things will genuinely be much, much better."" But, he adds, we must not ""take our foot off the throat of the beast now"". Boris Johnson knows there is a noisy collection of his own backbenchers who are spitting with anger over what the government's announced. And Labour are yet to commit to backing the government in next week's vote on this - they're expected to decide early next week once they have had the chance to speak to the government's experts. So this is Mr Johnson's case for why his plan is both necessary and, in his view, sensible. Laura Kuenssberg, political editor at BBC News, asks what the point of the national lockdown was if people are now moving to tougher restrictions. Boris Johnson replies it is ""very important"" for everyone to understand that ""this is not continuing the lockdown,"" with shops, hairdressers, gyms and places of worship among the venues reopening. ""This is a very different thing,"" he adds. ""What we have to do is keep eyes on the prize. In a few months we will have a vaccine, I'm absolutely convinced of it now. ""By April things will generally be much, much better."" He warns of relaxing too much now - taking our ""foot off the throat of the beast"" - when we are in a ""much better place"" than before the national lockdown. There are long months ahead but we are not abandoning the fight, he says. He stresses there is now option of mass testing, especially for tier-three communities ""who feel they have endured so much for so long"". Whitty is asked why more areas were not moved to tier three - and he replies that the government was keen to do enough to keep the R below one - but not to do anything unnecessary. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent It's clear the government now has greater confidence about the
impact the regional tiers will have. Research by the University of East Anglia
has shown that tier three is effective at suppressing the virus and tier two
stopped it from rising. Both of these tiers have been beefed up â in particular
around hospitality. The hope of government is that by going in hard and
placing nearly all of England in one of the top two tier, then in the coming
months areas will be able to drop down the tiers. The example of Liverpool is one that offers hope - it has
been placed in tier two, down from tier three before lockdown. The city used the new tool in the armoury â rapid mass
testing. The availability of these tests â which do not need to be
sent to the lab to be processed â is, ministers believe, a way of avoiding a
third lockdown and making progress during winter. Richard from Lancaster asks if the new vaccine will still work if Covid mutates. Patrick Vallance replies, ""This virus doesn't mutate as often as the flu virus but it does mutate."" He says none of the Covid mutations so far have changed in a way that would make the vaccines less effective but it is possible that future mutations might require new vaccines. He adds that making new vaccines would be possible, and points out this is what happens with flu vaccines every year. Â© 2025 BBC.

"New tough measures for England are the best way of avoiding another national lockdown, PM Boris Johnson tells a No 10 briefing England faces a ""hard winter"" but we must suppress the virus until vaccines ""come to our aid"", he says Chief Scientific Adviser Sir Patrick Vallance says the number of UK cases is still high but have started to ""turn the corner"" New coronavirus tier arrangements for England have been set out by the health secretary in the Commons They mean 55 million people will be in tiers 2 or 3 and remain banned from mixing with other households indoors after 2 December Elsewhere, in a Thanksgiving speech, US President-elect Joe Biden says ""we're at war with a virus, not with one another"" There have been more than 60 million coronavirus cases and 1.4 million deaths across the globe, according to Johns Hopkins University Edited by Sarah Fowler and Martha Buckley Many thanks for joining us today.

Danny AeberhardEurope regional editor, BBC World Service The Museum of London has launched an unusual project to capture how the coronavirus pandemic is affecting Londoners' lives - by collecting their dreams. The museum is working with researchers on dreams at a Canadian research institute. Sigmund Freud described dreams as the ""guardians of sleep"" - a description used as the name of the project, which the Museum of London says is the first of its kind. It seeks to document the effects of the pandemic on the subconscious of Londoners, as they work through some of the struggles and anxieties of the crisis in their sleep. The curator, Foteini Aravani, says people's testimonies will help to provide a more emotional and personal narrative for future generations. Just as many people might be feeling disappointed, frustrated and worried by the new tier system for England, so are MPs, with many in the House of Commons feeling the same way, says BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg. Some of the government's own Conservative MPs might even vote against the plan when it goes before them in the middle of next week. But ""while it might be bumpy"", there is ""not a realistic chance"" of it being blocked in any way. ""Like it or not, this is what is due to come in next Wednesday as the government tries to get control of this disease,"" she adds. Ski lifts stand idle at the resort of Les Menuires in the French Alps Would-be skiers in France have been left baffled after the prime minister said that winter resorts could open in the Alps and Pyrenees for the Christmas period - but that ski lifts would have to remain shut. Jean Castex said that mountain holidays were still a possibility, but that skiing was effectively ruled out. Hotels at resorts would be able to open when the country's national lockdown is lifted on 15 December, he said, while bars and restaurants will remain shut until January at the earliest. French President Emmanuel Macron said earlier this week thatFrance's ski resorts may have to remain closed until next yearbecause the current risks associated with the virus made it difficult for such sports to resume. He said he would discuss the issue with other European leaders and keep the decision under review. Ski resorts were responsible for numerous outbreaks of Covid-19 cases across Europe in the early days of the pandemic. Italy, Austria and Germany have all ordered lifts - even the high-altitude ones - at ski resorts to remain closed for the time being. But Switzerland is allowing ski resorts to remain open as long as they have strict safety measures in place, the health minister said today. David PittamBBC News Online Lia
Primrose (pictured left) is studying health and social care at college. The 17-year-old said: ""It
just feels like a bit of a kick in the teeth after cases went down so much. I work as a waitress so it'll affect me - I can't go back to work now. ""We

""I know it's not the biggest issue but we're both nearly 18 and we won't be able to go out and have a drink to celebrate. It's just a bit sad."" Mass testing was piloted in Liverpool Liam Thorp of the Liverpool Echo asks whether Boris Johnson will increase funding for people who are self-isolating. He also notes that the city hasn't had the best relationship with the Conservatives in the past and asks the PM if he will remember Liverpool's efforts in the future when making funding decisions. ""What's happened in Liverpool has been fantastic,"" replies the prime minister. He says it is not just the testing programme but the way ""everyone pulled together to get the virus down"". ""We are going to keep supporting you throughout Covid and beyond,"" he promises. And that is the last question of today's press conference. Ben Glaze of the Daily Mirror asks if it is a good idea for people to be travelling across the country to hug and kiss elderly relatives. The PM says it has been an ""incredibly difficult decision"" as ministers have to balance people's strong desire to celebrate a family holiday - adding ""which frankly they're going do do anyway"" - and keeping the virus under control. He urges everyone to be ""commonsensical"" and ""do the right thing"". ""Until the vaccine comes on stream, we are not out of the woods yet and we have to be very, very vigilant,"" he adds. Prof Whitty says he would want people to see family, but adds: ""Would I encourage someone to hug and kiss elderly relatives? No, I would not."" He adds while it is not against the law, it does not make sense as you could be carrying the virus. ""The fact you can do something, doesn't mean you should."" Speaking of his own plans for Christmas, he says he will spend it on hospital wards. Sir Patrick Vallance says the key thing is to follow the basic rules of keeping distance where you can, keeping areas well-ventilated and so on. It will not be a normal Christmas and ""hugging elderly relatives is not something to do,"" he adds. They want to survive to be hugged again, adds Whitty.  This video can not be played Coronavirus: 'Take it really seriously during Christmas' Dominic Yeatman of the Metro asks if it is fair that pubs and restaurants forced to close will get support but the businesses that depend on them will not. He also asks if people will still stick to the rules if they believe the end of the virus is in sight. Boris Johnson says closed businesses do deserve protection and cites business grants and the furlough scheme as examples of government help. On the second question, Chris Whitty says he believes people will abide by the rules adding that the ""really heartening thing of this whole dreadful period"" has been the altruism, self-discipline and patience of the British public. ""You can always find some people who haven't followed the rules but they are in the minority,"" he says. Sky News's Beth Rigby asks about the loosening of restrictions over Christmas and whether a rise in cases is anticipated, leading to stricter rules before and afterwards. Prof Chris Whitty says Christmas will increase the risk: ""Everyone knows that, it's not a secret at all."" But it is not the only risk over this next period, he adds, with January and February the most difficult time for the NHS and a ""time of extreme pressure"". It is ""not the time of year where we want to be taking reckless decisions"" because ""things will be difficult for several months"", he adds. Christmas is an element of that but only one element. Christmas can be enjoyed without a spike in cases if people ""take it really seriously"" and ""don't do unnecessary things, just because you can"". People should ""take sensible precautions"", he adds. A number of Conservative MPs have lashed out at the introduction of new tiered Covid restrictions in England. The majority of the country will be placed in the two toughest levels when national lockdown ends on 2 December. The Covid Recovery Group, made up of Tory backbenchers, described the move as ""authoritarianism at work"". The group's deputy chair, Tory MP Steve Baker, called the announcement ""truly appalling"" and questioned if it was ""necessary and proportionate"" to the threat from coronavirus. The government has promised to publish an impact assessment early next week before MPs get a chance to vote on the new rules on Tuesday. But a revolt is brewing among the government's own MPs, including the chair of the influential 1922 committee of backbenchers, Sir Graham Brady. Read more. Military personnel helped at test sites in Liverpool Beth Rigby of Sky News asks how mass testing could be delivered to 40% of the population - asking if the whole British Army would have to be deployed. The PM replies he doesn't ""want to over-sell"" how easy it is to do it, and it ""depends on strong local leadership"" and ""real spirit"" in the local community. It is also ""only part of the panoply of interventions you need to defeat the disease"", he adds. The Army will help and support where necessary, but the key thing is local leaders saying they want the mass testing and the ""local will"" for it to be done. There will be ""adequate personnel"" and there are ""huge stocks"" of the lateral flow tests themselves right now, says Boris Johnson, adding there is hope they'll be made in the UK eventually.  ITV's Robert Peston asks the PM whether he will have to raise taxes and cut spending as a result of the pandemic. He also asks why the government's ""whack-a-mole"" strategy ""didn't work"". On the economy, Boris Johnson says his government is taking steps to ensure the country can ""bounce back from Covid"". ""It will need fiscal prudence - and that you will get from this government,"" he adds. On the lockdown strategy, Chris Whitty says, ""There are tiers that would work in the spring and summer which I would not expect to work at this stage."" Patrick Vallance says implementing weaker restrictions now would mean the government would have to resort to ""much more drastic measures"" later on. ""Madness is doing the same thing twice and expecting different results,"" Whitty adds. Chris MasonPolitical Correspondent The news conference can be summed up like this: the scientists say cases will rise in tier one, they'll hold steady in tier two and they'll fall under tier three. The prime minister wants to offer hope: ""Your tier is not your destiny,"" he says, and, ""By April things will genuinely be much, much better."" But, he adds, we must not ""take our foot off the throat of the beast now"".

"This video can not be played What you need to know about Chancellor Rishi Sunak's speech â in two minutes The ""economic emergency"" caused by Covid-19 has only just begun, according to chancellor Rishi Sunak, as he warned the pandemic would deal lasting damage to growth and jobs. Official forecasts now predict the biggest economic decline in 300 years. The UK economy is expected to shrink by 11.3% this year and not return to its pre-crisis size until the end of 2022. Government borrowing will rise to its highest outside of wartime to deal with the economic impact. The government's independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) expects the number of unemployed people to surge to 2.6 million by the middle of next year. It meansthe unemployment rate will hit 7.5%, its highest level since the financial crisis in 2009. However, fewer jobs are expected to be lost than predicted this summer. Setting out his Spending Review detailing how much would be spent on public services, Mr Sunak said the government was dealing with an ""economic emergency"". He added: ""That's why we have taken, and continue to take, extraordinary measures to protect people's jobs and incomes."" The government hassubsidised the wagesof employees unable to work due to the pandemic, in an effort to protect jobs. It saidextending these schemes to next Marchmeant 300,000 fewer people would be out of work. Mr Sunakconfirmed that around 1.3 million public sector workers - excluding some NHS staff and those earning less than Â£24,000- will have their pay frozen next year. The chancellor said he could not justify an across-the-board increase when many in the private sector had seen their pay and hours cut in the crisis. But Mr Sunak said lower-paid public sector workers would be guaranteed at least a Â£250 pay rise next year. The shadow chancellor, Anneliese Dodds, criticised the pay freeze. She said: ""Earlier this year the chancellor stood on his doorstep and clapped for key workers. Today, his government institutes a pay freeze for many of them. This takes a sledgehammer to consumer confidence."" Civil servant Robert said he was 'deeply disappointed' Robert, a 25-year-old civil servant and representative for the PCS Union, saidhe was ""deeply disappointed"". ""[Civil servants] have spearheaded the response to the pandemic and worked tirelessly to deliver Brexit. We've stepped up and delivered... and I'd like to be recognised for that."" Having worked for various government departments since graduating from university a few years ago, he says he feels ""let down"".

The UK economy remains in rescue mode The minimum wage - which has been rebranded as the National Living Wage - will increase by 2.2% - or 19p - to Â£8.91 an hour, with the rate extended to those aged 23 and over. Other rates were also increased. From next April, 16 and 17 year-olds will see their pay go up to Â£4.62 per hour, from Â£4.55 today. TheUK also ditched its policy of spending 0.7% of national incomeon overseas aid to help deal with the coronavirus crisis at home. Mr Sunak said the new 0.5% target - which adds up to about Â£4bn in savings - will be ""temporary"". Andmillions of retirees will see the future value of their pension cutowing to a planned change in the way payments are calculated from 2030. Mr Sunak said the government had already spent Â£280bn to help support the economy through the coronavirus. It will spend a further Â£55bn next year as part of a package of measures to support the recovery. This includes billions of pounds to help people find jobs. The UK is expected to borrow Â£393.5bn this financial year to help pay for economic relief measures. Borrowing is also forecast by the OBR to remain above Â£100bn-a-year - or 4% of the size of the UK economy - in five years time. In recent years, the government has been able to borrow easily at very low interest rates, which makes its debt more affordable. At the moment it pays just 0.32% interest to borrow for ten years. However, Mr Sunak said long-term scarring meant the economy would be 3% smaller in 2025 than expected in the March budget. What is GDP? Low-paid public sector workers to get Â£250 pay rise Sunak cuts UK overseas aid budget Unemployed predicted to rise to 2.6 million The OBR said the coronavirus pandemic had ""delivered the largest peacetime shock to the global economy on record"", while recent restrictions across the UK had taken ""the wind out of an already flagging recovery"". It said the UK's later and longer lockdown this spring meant it had experienced ""a deeper fall and slower recovery in economic activity"" than some of its European neighbours. The independent forecaster also warned that tax rises or spending cuts would be needed in future years to stabilise the UK's growing debt pile. Richard Hughes, the OBR's chairman said: ""The chancellor will need to find Â£20bn to Â£30bn in spending cuts or tax rises if he wants to balance revenues and day-to-day spending, and stop debt rising by the end of this parliament."" Is that the end of it? The official forecasts assume that 2 December spells the end of lockdown, that we remain in the equivalent of Tier 3 restrictions until the spring - and then the vaccine becomes widely adopted in the second half of 2021. Too cautious - or optimistic? If anything, 2020 has taught us that assumptions can last as long as a disposable face covering. But it'll take longer for economic life to spring back to rude health. Reviving job prospects, investment and consumption will take TLC. Even when the official crystal ball gets misty, in 2025, output is still 3% lower than it was previously expected to be. And that's without the  risk of a no-deal; the OBR says that could mean that output is a further 1.5% by 2025. Some economists think the hit could be greater (indeed, the Governor of the Bank of England says the long term impact of a no- deal could exceed that of a virus). Rishi Sunak has to decide when to turn off the support to the convalescing economy - and when to  start  patching up the public finances by firing up tax rises. The extreme uncertainty underlines how fraught - and costly - that decision could be. House prices are expected to fall in 2021 and 2022. The OBR expects a recent revival in the market to end next year when astamp duty holidaystops in March and more people lose their jobs as government support schemes are pared back. However, the end of the tax break is expected to contribute to a 3.5% fall in house prices next year and a further 2.6% drop in 2022. The OBR added: ""Despite a steady recovery from 2022 onwards, the level of house prices remains around 17% lower (in 2025) compared to our March forecast."" The OBR said the ""unresolved nature"" of the negotiations between the UK and EU over a Brexit deal had ""further clouded"" the economic outlook. It said failure to secure a deal would reduce the size of the UK economy by a further 2% in 2021, with permanent damage to growth and living standards in future years. Under this no-deal scenario, the economy would not return to the size it was before the pandemic hit until the second half of 2023, while unemployment would peak at a higher rate of 8.3%.

"New tough measures for England are the best way of avoiding another national lockdown, PM Boris Johnson tells a No 10 briefing England faces a ""hard winter"" but we must suppress the virus until vaccines ""come to our aid"", he says Chief Scientific Adviser Sir Patrick Vallance says the number of UK cases is still high but have started to ""turn the corner"" New coronavirus tier arrangements for England have been set out by the health secretary in the Commons They mean 55 million people will be in tiers 2 or 3 and remain banned from mixing with other households indoors after 2 December Elsewhere, in a Thanksgiving speech, US President-elect Joe Biden says ""we're at war with a virus, not with one another"" There have been more than 60 million coronavirus cases and 1.4 million deaths across the globe, according to Johns Hopkins University Edited by Sarah Fowler and Martha Buckley Many thanks for joining us today. The live page coverage has been brought to you by: Martha Buckley, Alice Evans, Sarah Fowler, Becky Morton, Mal Siret, Lauren Turner and Kate Whannel. Thanks for joining us today - we will be bringing our live page coverage to a close soon, on what has been a busy day of announcements. Here's a round-up of some of the main headlines. This video can not be played Boris Johnson: 'Your tier is not your destiny' Prime Minister Boris Johnson says the new approach is designed so that regions can move down the scale of restrictions, adding ""your tier is not your destiny"". People have been asked to watch the 94th Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade in New York on their televisions Some of the dayâs key developments from around the world
include:  We have been answering your latest question about the new rules - and where they leave you. They include whether or not you can plan a pub meal on Boxing Day if you live in Warwickshire, and whether a university student returning to their family at Christmas counts as a separate household. Read more here. Danny AeberhardEurope regional editor, BBC World Service The Museum of London has launched an unusual project to capture how the coronavirus pandemic is affecting Londoners' lives - by collecting their dreams. The museum is working with researchers on dreams at a Canadian research institute. Sigmund Freud described dreams as the ""guardians of sleep"" - a description used as the name of the project, which the Museum of London says is the first of its kind. It seeks to document the effects of the pandemic on the subconscious of Londoners, as they work through some of the struggles and anxieties of the crisis in their sleep. The curator, Foteini Aravani, says people's testimonies will help to provide a more emotional and personal narrative for future generations. Just as many people might be feeling disappointed, frustrated and worried by the new tier system for England, so are MPs, with many in the House of Commons feeling the same way, says BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg. Some of the government's own Conservative MPs might even vote against the plan when it goes before them in the middle of next week. But ""while it might be bumpy"", there is ""not a realistic chance"" of it being blocked in any way. ""Like it or not, this is what is due to come in next Wednesday as the government tries to get control of this disease,"" she adds. Ski lifts stand idle at the resort of Les Menuires in the French Alps Would-be skiers in France have been left baffled after the prime minister said that winter resorts could open in the Alps and Pyrenees for the Christmas period - but that ski lifts would have to remain shut. Jean Castex said that mountain holidays were still a possibility, but that skiing was effectively ruled out. Hotels at resorts would be able to open when the country's national lockdown is lifted on 15 December, he said, while bars and restaurants will remain shut until January at the earliest. French President Emmanuel Macron said earlier this week thatFrance's ski resorts may have to remain closed until next yearbecause the current risks associated with the virus made it difficult for such sports to resume. He said he would discuss the issue with other European leaders and keep the decision under review. Ski resorts were responsible for numerous outbreaks of Covid-19 cases across Europe in the early days of the pandemic. Italy, Austria and Germany have all ordered lifts - even the high-altitude ones - at ski resorts to remain closed for the time being. But Switzerland is allowing ski resorts to remain open as long as they have strict safety measures in place, the health minister said today. David PittamBBC News Online Lia
Primrose (pictured left) is studying health and social care at college. The 17-year-old said: ""It
just feels like a bit of a kick in the teeth after cases went down so much. I work as a waitress so it'll affect me - I can't go back to work now. ""We
watched the announcement in class and he actually said tier two first, then said 'Oh sorry, tier three.' It was the biggest heartbreak. ""My age group is in a
weird place - we're at an age where we're expected to get Christmas presents for
people but we don't have the money because we can't work."" Her classmate, Poppi West, also 17, added:"" It's annoying that we keep going in and out - it feels like we're going round in circles. ""I know it's not the biggest issue but we're both nearly 18 and we won't be able to go out and have a drink to celebrate. It's just a bit sad."" Mass testing was piloted in Liverpool Liam Thorp of the Liverpool Echo asks whether Boris Johnson will increase funding for people who are self-isolating. He also notes that the city hasn't had the best relationship with the Conservatives in the past and asks the PM if he will remember Liverpool's efforts in the future when making funding decisions. ""What's happened in Liverpool has been fantastic,"" replies the prime minister. He says it is not just the testing programme but the way ""everyone pulled together to get the virus down"". ""We are going to keep supporting you throughout Covid and beyond,"" he promises. And that is the last question of today's press conference. Ben Glaze of the Daily Mirror asks if it is a good idea for people to be travelling across the country to hug and kiss elderly relatives. The PM says it has been an ""incredibly difficult decision"" as ministers have to balance people's strong desire to celebrate a family holiday - adding ""which frankly they're going do do anyway"" - and keeping the virus under control. He urges everyone to be ""commonsensical"" and ""do the right thing"". ""Until the vaccine comes on stream, we are not out of the woods yet and we have to be very, very vigilant,"" he adds. Prof Whitty says he would want people to see family, but adds: ""Would I encourage someone to hug and kiss elderly relatives? No, I would not."" He adds while it is not against the law, it does not make sense as you could be carrying the virus. ""The fact you can do something, doesn't mean you should."" Speaking of his own plans for Christmas, he says he will spend it on hospital wards. Sir Patrick Vallance says the key thing is to follow the basic rules of keeping distance where you can, keeping areas well-ventilated and so on. It will not be a normal Christmas and ""hugging elderly relatives is not something to do,"" he adds. They want to survive to be hugged again, adds Whitty.  This video can not be played Coronavirus: 'Take it really seriously during Christmas' Dominic Yeatman of the Metro asks if it is fair that pubs and restaurants forced to close will get support but the businesses that depend on them will not. He also asks if people will still stick to the rules if they believe the end of the virus is in sight. Boris Johnson says closed businesses do deserve protection and cites business grants and the furlough scheme as examples of government help. On the second question, Chris Whitty says he believes people will abide by the rules adding that the ""really heartening thing of this whole dreadful period"" has been the altruism, self-discipline and patience of the British public. ""You can always find some people who haven't followed the rules but they are in the minority,"" he says. Sky News's Beth Rigby asks about the loosening of restrictions over Christmas and whether a rise in cases is anticipated, leading to stricter rules before and afterwards. Prof Chris Whitty says Christmas will increase the risk: ""Everyone knows that, it's not a secret at all."" But it is not the only risk over this next period, he adds, with January and February the most difficult time for the NHS and a ""time of extreme pressure"". It is ""not the time of year where we want to be taking reckless decisions"" because ""things will be difficult for several months"", he adds. Christmas is an element of that but only one element. Christmas can be enjoyed without a spike in cases if people ""take it really seriously"" and ""don't do unnecessary things, just because you can"". People should ""take sensible precautions"", he adds. A number of Conservative MPs have lashed out at the introduction of new tiered Covid restrictions in England. The majority of the country will be placed in the two toughest levels when national lockdown ends on 2 December. The Covid Recovery Group, made up of Tory backbenchers, described the move as ""authoritarianism at work"". The group's deputy chair, Tory MP Steve Baker, called the announcement ""truly appalling"" and questioned if it was ""necessary and proportionate"" to the threat from coronavirus. The government has promised to publish an impact assessment early next week before MPs get a chance to vote on the new rules on Tuesday. But a revolt is brewing among the government's own MPs, including the chair of the influential 1922 committee of backbenchers, Sir Graham Brady. Read more. Military personnel helped at test sites in Liverpool Beth Rigby of Sky News asks how mass testing could be delivered to 40% of the population - asking if the whole British Army would have to be deployed. The PM replies he doesn't ""want to over-sell"" how easy it is to do it, and it ""depends on strong local leadership"" and ""real spirit"" in the local community. It is also ""only part of the panoply of interventions you need to defeat the disease"", he adds. The Army will help and support where necessary, but the key thing is local leaders saying they want the mass testing and the ""local will"" for it to be done. There will be ""adequate personnel"" and there are ""huge stocks"" of the lateral flow tests themselves right now, says Boris Johnson, adding there is hope they'll be made in the UK eventually.  ITV's Robert Peston asks the PM whether he will have to raise taxes and cut spending as a result of the pandemic. He also asks why the government's ""whack-a-mole"" strategy ""didn't work"". On the economy, Boris Johnson says his government is taking steps to ensure the country can ""bounce back from Covid"". ""It will need fiscal prudence - and that you will get from this government,"" he adds. On the lockdown strategy, Chris Whitty says, ""There are tiers that would work in the spring and summer which I would not expect to work at this stage."" Patrick Vallance says implementing weaker restrictions now would mean the government would have to resort to ""much more drastic measures"" later on. ""Madness is doing the same thing twice and expecting different results,"" Whitty adds. Chris MasonPolitical Correspondent The news conference can be summed up like this: the scientists say cases will rise in tier one, they'll hold steady in tier two and they'll fall under tier three. The prime minister wants to offer hope: ""Your tier is not your destiny,"" he says, and, ""By April things will genuinely be much, much better."" But, he adds, we must not ""take our foot off the throat of the beast now"". Boris Johnson knows there is a noisy collection of his own backbenchers who are spitting with anger over what the government's announced. And Labour are yet to commit to backing the government in next week's vote on this - they're expected to decide early next week once they have had the chance to speak to the government's experts. So this is Mr Johnson's case for why his plan is both necessary and, in his view, sensible. Laura Kuenssberg, political editor at BBC News, asks what the point of the national lockdown was if people are now moving to tougher restrictions. Boris Johnson replies it is ""very important"" for everyone to understand that ""this is not continuing the lockdown,"" with shops, hairdressers, gyms and places of worship among the venues reopening. ""This is a very different thing,"" he adds. ""What we have to do is keep eyes on the prize. In a few months we will have a vaccine, I'm absolutely convinced of it now. ""By April things will generally be much, much better."" He warns of relaxing too much now - taking our ""foot off the throat of the beast"" - when we are in a ""much better place"" than before the national lockdown. There are long months ahead but we are not abandoning the fight, he says. He stresses there is now option of mass testing, especially for tier-three communities ""who feel they have endured so much for so long"". Whitty is asked why more areas were not moved to tier three - and he replies that the government was keen to do enough to keep the R below one - but not to do anything unnecessary. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent It's clear the government now has greater confidence about the
impact the regional tiers will have. Research by the University of East Anglia
has shown that tier three is effective at suppressing the virus and tier two
stopped it from rising. Both of these tiers have been beefed up â in particular
around hospitality. The hope of government is that by going in hard and
placing nearly all of England in one of the top two tier, then in the coming
months areas will be able to drop down the tiers. The example of Liverpool is one that offers hope - it has
been placed in tier two, down from tier three before lockdown. The city used the new tool in the armoury â rapid mass
testing. The availability of these tests â which do not need to be
sent to the lab to be processed â is, ministers believe, a way of avoiding a
third lockdown and making progress during winter. Richard from Lancaster asks if the new vaccine will still work if Covid mutates. Patrick Vallance replies, ""This virus doesn't mutate as often as the flu virus but it does mutate."" He says none of the Covid mutations so far have changed in a way that would make the vaccines less effective but it is possible that future mutations might require new vaccines. He adds that making new vaccines would be possible, and points out this is what happens with flu vaccines every year. Â© 2025 BBC.

"The covid crisis is on track to cut average pay packets by Â£1,200 a year by 2025, according to new analysis. The prediction comes from the Resolution Foundation, a think tank focused on improving living standards for people on low-to-middle incomes. It comes a day after Chancellor Rishi Sunak warned unemployment could surge to 2.6 million by mid-2021. The economic downturn will continue to squeeze living standards in Britain warned the foundation. ""The Covid crisis is causing immense damage to the public finances, and permanent damage to family finances too, with pay packets on track to be Â£1,200 a year lower than pre-pandemic expectations,"" warned Torsten Bell, chief executive of the Resolution Foundation. Rishi Sunak warns 'economic emergency has only just begun' Spending Review: Unemployed predicted to rise to 2.6 million Coronavirus: Retail workers 'scared' as cases surge Its new research published on Thursday, Here Today, Gone Tomorrow, says that ""the combined effects of weaker pay growth and higher unemployment will serve to prolong Britain's living standards squeeze"". Its analysis shows household incomes have been growing at a slower pace even before the pandemic. They are on course to grow just 10% during the 15 years from the start of the 2008 global financial crisis until 2023. But household incomes grew by a much higher 40% in the 15 years leading up to the financial crisis. This video can not be played What you need to know about Chancellor Rishi Sunak's speech â in two minutes The Resolution Foundation says further pressure will come next April, when about six million households will lose more than Â£1,000 through reduced Universal Credit payments. It also warned the bulk of the government's extra spending to deal with the ""economic emergency"" will need to come from tax rises. ""While the priority now is to support the economy, the permanent damage to the public finances mean taxes will rise in future,"" added Mr Bell. ""The pandemic is just the latest of three 'once in a lifetime' economic shocks the UK experienced in a little over a decade, following the financial crisis and Brexit,"" he added. ""The result is an unprecedented 15-year living standards squeeze."" In Mr Sunak's Spending Review he pledged Â£280bn this year to help get the country through the pandemic downturn. ""But which taxes those will be, like which Brexit we can expect, are questions the chancellor left for another day."" The chancellor told MPs the UK economy is predicted to shrink by 11.3% in 2020, which has been described as the ""largest fall in output for more than 300 years"".

"Extra funding announced for care services falls ""alarmingly short"" of the amount needed to meet demand, council directors in England have said. The Association of Directors of Adult Social Services (ADASS) said the Â£1bn the chancellor announced for social care was ""fragmented"" and ""short-term"". It said Covid-19 had led to a huge surge in demand for care services. Councils will getÂ£300m in new money for adult and children's servicesand be allowed to raise more in tax. Local authorities will be able to levy an additional adult social care charge on council tax bills of up to 3%, specifically for the care of older and disabled people. In his Spending Review on Wednesday, Rishi Sunak said these measures would mean councils had access to an extra Â£1bn to fund social care. Care providers 'will go to the wall' without cash Spending Review: Key points at-a-glance Â£3bn for NHS but Sunak warns of 'economic shock' He said this was on top of the additional Â£1bn social care grant provided by the government this year, which would be maintained into 2021. ADASS has previously warned of""catastrophic consequences""without immediate investment in the social care sector. It said councils could run out of cash and care providers could go to the wall, with increased costs due to coronavirus pandemic exacerbating an existing crisis. In a statement issued on Wednesday, ADASS president James Bullion said the organisation had hoped for a settlement that would have helped it ""stabilise"" care and support services, as well as greater equality with NHS staff. ""While we are still examining the detail, it seems as if the fragmented short-term funding announced by the chancellor falls alarmingly short,"" he said. Mr Bullion said funding was needed to ensure ""care providers remain in business, staff are are paid a national care wage that properly rewards them for their amazing work, and carers get the vital breaks they need to keep going"".

"Chief Medical Officer Dr Michael McBride said 2020 cannot be a normal Christmas People should limit their contact with others before Covid-19 restrictions are relaxed at Christmas, Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill has said. Across the UK,three households can mix for five daysfrom 23-27 December. However, Ms O'Neill said it was important to reduce Covid-19 transmission ""as low as possible"". First Minister Arlene Foster said the next two weeks ""are crucial... so that we can all have the safest and the happiest Christmas possible"". From midnight, Northern Ireland enters a two-week circuit breaker, with the closure of many businesses in the retail, leisure and hospitality sectors. NI Covid-19 restrictions: Your Questions Answered How many people can get together at Christmas? The deputy first minister also said a ""number of things need clarified"" around Christmas arrangements which will be the focus of the executive's meeting on Tuesday. She said these included care home arrangements, students coming home and the definition of a household. ""There is a different in approach across all the jurisdictions in terms of, for example, what a household looks like and it's important that we define that for ourselves,"" the deputy first minister added. In Scotland, a three household bubble should contain no more than eight people over the age of 11. Arlene Foster and Michelle O'Neill gave a briefing at Stomont after the executive meeting on Thursday The executive also announced that a Covid-19 Taskforce was being establishedto oversee the roll-out of the vaccine and testing programmes. The deputy first minister said it will be chaired by a new interim head of the Civil Service and will also be responsible for public messaging to improve compliance. Mrs Foster said therate of transmissionwas currently believed to be ""just below 1"". She said she commended ""all those who are re-doubling their efforts to make our high street as Covid secure as possible for their reopening on 11 December"". ""I want to pay tribute to our scientists, our academics, medics and health workers who are providing us with the pathways out of this pandemic through mass vaccination and testing programmes,"" she continued. The broadcast press conferences from Stormont that follow executive meetings have understandably often been sombre occasions. The news of daily deaths and increased hospital admissions bring home the reality of Covid-19. The news that many families are suffering shows that eight months on, we are still struggling with this pandemic. Whilst this is bleak and painful, today's press conference did offer some shades of light for the future. The news of a vaccination programme offers hope that could save lives and end talk of lockdown and restrictions. There was also news that Northern Ireland'sR valueis just below one - lower than England and Wales. The first and deputy first ministers also offered some hope to the hospitality sector who desperately want to get back into business on 11 December. Conversations with the Chief Medical Officer Dr McBride and the Chief Scientific Adviser Professor Ian Young about lifting the trading restrictions are ongoing. Much depends on how the next fortnight pans out. Today offered some glimpses of the future and for some at least there is hope on the horizon. On Thursday, eight further deaths linked to Covid-19 in Northern Ireland were reported by the Department of Health, bringing its total to 962. The department also recorded 442 new cases of coronavirus. Five hospitals are currently operating beyond their bed capacity. They are the Causeway, Mater, Royal Victoria, Ulster and South West Acute. There are confirmed outbreaks of Covid-19 in 139 care homes. The UK government has said anyone travelling to or from Northern Ireland can travel on 22 and 28 December, but ""only meet with their Christmas bubble"" between 23 and 27 December.

"Britain's major pub groups and brewers have pleaded with Prime Minister Boris Johnson to save an industry facing the ""darkest of moments"". Executives at Fuller's, Carlsberg UK, Greene King, and Heineken UK are among more than 50 signatories of a letter warning of huge job losses. They call on him to publish the evidence justifying the coronavirus restrictions on the industry. A Downing Street spokesperson said they would respond in due course. The letter says: ""The pub is clearly being singled out for exceptionally harsh and unjustified treatment and unless your government changes course, and soon, huge portions of this most British of institutions will simply not be there come the spring. ""We believe it is in the interests of openness and transparency that any evidence showing pubs to be the source of outbreaks of the virus, and thereby justifying these extra restrictions, must be published immediately."" Covid pub rules 'killing Christmas not saving it' One in three hospitality firms fear collapse New jobs in UK hospitality sector 'non existent' The letter comes ahead of a planned announcement on Thursday that could see two-thirds of the country placed into tiers two or three when the current lockdown lifts next month. Pubs in tier two areas will be able to serve drinks only to customers having a substantial meal, and those in tier three will not be able to open. Pubs, and the hospitality industry generally, have been among the hardest-hit sectors during lockdown. More than a third of hospitality firms say they have little or no confidence of surviving the next three months, according to data collected by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) earlier this month. Other signatories to the letter include executives at Adnams, Marston's, Budweiser UK, Punch Pubs, Shepherd Neame and Young's. They tell the PM they employ ""hundreds of thousands of people and contribute billions of pounds of economic value to the UK economy - all of this is at risk today"".

""How can it be that people mixing in unregulated private homes is deemed safer than gathering in limited numbers in larger, regulated and ultimately Covid-secure venues like pubs? There is no logic to this decision. ""It is clear that pubs are being scapegoated despite a lack of available evidence that they are any more responsible for outbreaks than other types of venue. We cannot stand idly by and allow these measures to destroy our businesses."" If restrictions cannot be relaxed, the pubs are demanding, among other things, financial support in line with the first lockdown, immediate changes to business rates, and a cut in the ""punitively high"" beer duty rate.

"The now-scrapped relief road was proposed as a solution to tackling congestion on the M4 around Newport Â£800m should be invested in public transport to help ease traffic jams on the M4, a report has recommended. A commission was set upafter Welsh ministers scrapped plans to build a Â£1.6bn relief roadaround Newport. To encourage people out of their cars, its report suggested considering a ""workplace parking levy"" and ensuring public transport was ""affordable for all"". The panel was told not to consider plans for another motorway. TheM4 around Newport is the fourth most congested stretch of road in the UK. The South East Wales Transport Commission recommended tripling the number of train stations between Cardiff and the River Severn, from three to nine, as well as establishing bus and cycle route networks in Newport. If all the recommendations were acted on, it suggested more than 90% of people in Cardiff and Newport would live ""within one mile of a rail station or rapid bus corridor"". The report recommended better integration and coordination of rail and bus networks and integrated tickets across all services. Services should run every 15 minutes and stations should be more accessible on foot and for cyclists. Currently, common M4 journeys are poorly served by public transport alternatives, it said, with Newport served particularly poorly by rail. It said ""flexible office hubs"" should be established in major towns and cities, in order to support remote working. Although most M4 journeys cannot be substituted by walking or cycling because of their distance, the report said active travel had ""a key role"". Newport M4 traffic jams: Average 50mph limit recommended Call for public transport boost to ease M4 jams The commission suggested making walking or cycling the ""natural choice"" for the first and last mile of public transport journeys and recommend establishing ""a major cycleway"" linking Cardiff and Newport. Although travel habits have changed due to Covid-19, the report said those changes ""do not fundamentally alter"" the need for more transport options and claimed the pandemic provided ""an opportunity to prepare significant transport improvements while demand is reduced"". A 20% reduction in flow on the M4 would have a significant positive impact on journey times, it said. This video can not be played ""Everything outside gets dirty and it affects our chests - it's dreadful."" The commission, chaired by Lord Burns, described its recommendations as ""ambitious yet achievable"". It said its ""fast track"" recommendations - made in a progress update in December 2019 - were ""consistent"" with their final recommendations. This included the introduction of a 50mph average speed control and more lane guidance on the westbound approach to the Brynglas tunnels in Newport. The report said the cost of the recommendations would be between Â£600m and Â£800m: The majority of the cost would be in developing the rail network on the south Wales main line - costing between Â£390m and Â£540m Developments on the line would include new stations on Newport Road in Cardiff and a new Cardiff Parkway station in St Mellons, plans for which have already been developed by a private company In Newport, the report suggested creating a Newport West station near Tredegar Park, and a Newport East station in Somerton, as well as stations at Llanwern and Magor A bike hire scheme, similar to Nextbike in Cardiff, should be established in Newport too At peak times, between 3,000 and 5,000 vehicles approach the Brynglas tunnels every hour. Alleviating congestion on the M4 by moving commuters and travellers on to public transport would benefit goods and services traffic which are less able to switch to other modes of transport, according to the report. Could UK government build an M4 relief road? Welsh road tolls and charging to be considered in review Environmentalists had long-opposed the plans for the scrapped relief road First Minister Mark Drakefordscrapped plansto build a Â£1.6bn relief road last year after declaring a climate emergency because of its environmental impact, as well as the effect on the public purse. Welsh Secretary Simon Hart said in October theUK government had not ruled out bypassingthe Welsh Government to build to road. The commission said in principle it was in favour of road charging, but was not recommending this due to the absence of a UK-wide scheme, but said it should be considered again in future. The UK government said it continued to believe that a relief road remained the ""most viable solution to the ongoing congestion problems"" around Newport. A spokesman added: ""The report is welcome and highlights the undoubted necessity for improvements in south Wales' transport infrastructure. ""The need to make improvements for people using the road and rail network is why the UK government launched its Union Connectivity Review last month.""

"A statue of Sir Thomas Picton was boxed up in preparation for its removal from Cardiff City Hall Wales has 209 streets, buildings, portraits or monuments commemorating people directly involved with the slave trade or who opposed its abolition. An audit also found ""commemoration of people of colour"" to be ""negligible"". The review was ordered by First Minister Mark Drakeford following protests prompted by thekilling of George Floyd in the US. Mr Drakeford said the audit ""helps us establish an honest picture of our history"". Commemorations identified included: 13 monuments, buildings or street names commemorating people who took part in the African slave trade 56 monuments, buildings or street names commemorating people who owned or directly benefited from plantations or mines worked by slaves 120 monuments, buildings or street names commemorating people who opposed abolition of the slave trade or slavery 20 monuments, buildings or street names commemorating people accused of crimes against black people, notably in colonial Africa The audit, led by Gaynor Legall, found commemorations of people connected with the slave trade were often shown without any accompanying interpretation to address matters of contention, so the figures were presented solely as role models rather than representatives of challenging aspects of the past. The audit also unearthed commemorations to anti-slavery activists across Wales, such as Henry Richard in Tregaron, Ceredigion, street names for Samuel Romilly and the Pantycelyn halls of residence at Aberystwyth University, Ceredigion. The Thomas Picton obelisk is on Picton Terrace in Carmarthen The report said: ""It is striking that the only sculpture depicting people of black heritage is not a monument to named individuals, but an anonymous statue group in Cardiff Bay."" A statue to celebrate the life and contributions of Wales'first black headteacher Betty Campbellis set to be placed in Cardiff, but not until next year. There have been widespread calls for the statues of slave owners and those who supported the slave trade to be removed, but some have opposed the idea. In July, a statue of a 19th Century slave owner Sir Thomas Pictonin Cardiff City Hall was covered over. In Denbigh, people will be consulted on removing a statuehonouring Victorian adventurer Henry Morton Stanleywho opponents claim had links to slavery. Ysgol Goronwy Owen in Benllech on Anglesey is mentioned in the audit as its namesake poet owned slaves. A statue of Henry Morton Stanley was installed in Denbigh town centre in 2010 ""While the tragic killing of George Floyd happened almost 4,000 miles away, it sparked global action that shone a light on racial inequality in society today,"" Mr Drakeford said. ""That inequality exists in Welsh society too and we must work towards a Wales which is more equal. ""This audit provides important evidence which helps us establish an honest picture of our history. ""This is not about rewriting our past or naming and shaming. It is about learning from the events of the past."" He said the audit was the ""first stage of a much bigger piece of work""  to ""consider how we move forward with this information as we seek to honour and celebrate our diverse communities"". The audit was led by Gaynor Legall, who was the first black woman city councillor in Wales Speaking to Claire Summers on BBC Radio Wales, Ms Legall said: ""We certainly were careful not to make recommendations - different people have different views, some feel more strongly than others. ""We would like to see some more commemorations of people of colour. ""We would like to see that this work is carried on, and perhaps incorporated into the new work around the curriculum, so that people in Wales - children, young people in particular - can have a true picture of where its economy grew from.""

"Abdalraouf Abdallah was convicted of terror offences in 2016 A convicted terrorist organiser, who has refused to tell an inquiry about his contact with the Manchester Arena bomber, is to be released from jail. Abdalraouf Abdallah, 27, was jailed in 2016 after being found guilty of helping people travel to Syria to join the Islamic State group. The Manchester Arena Inquiry heard he was in touch with bomber Salman Abedi in the months leading up to the attack. The BBC understands he will be released on licence later this week. A source said his licence conditions would be among the strictest imposed on a released prisoner. Arena attacker calls 'on terror inmate's phone' Paraplegic man guilty of terror charge The road to the Manchester Arena bombing The Manchester Arena Inquiry, which is investigating all aspects of the attack carried out by Salman Abedi in May 2017 that killed 22 people, has heard that Abdallah is a ""witness with important evidence to give"". But, when interviewed in prison this summer by inquiry lawyers, Abdallah refused to answer any questions in case he incriminated himself. Abdallah, who moved to the UK as a child and grew up in south Manchester, was paralysed from the waist down while fighting in the Libyan revolution of 2011. In July 2016 he was jailed for five years and six months,having been convicted following a trial, but time spent on remand and on curfew at home means that his custodial sentence expires this week. When released, he will spend a further four years on licence. His trial heard that, from his wheelchair and mainly using a mobile phone, Abdallah arranged for the movement of money and fighters to Syria. When Abdallah was sentenced, the judge said ""there was no evidence of indoctrinating of others"". However, the Arena inquiry has heard that when Abdallah had been arrested in 2014, his phone containedcorrespondence with Abedi about suicide, martyrdom - including the death of a senior al-Qaeda figure - and ""maidens of paradise"". Those who knew Abedi considered Abdallah to be a radicalising influence on him. Abedi visited Abdallah in prison and spoke to him on an illegally held mobile phone during the period in early 2017 when the bomb was being prepared. The prison authorities confiscated Abdallah's phone before the attack and - when analysed - it was found to have been used to make calls and attempted calls to Abedi's number. That a man jailed for terrorist organising via a phone was able to obtain a mobile in prison, which he used to speak to a known extremist like Abedi, is a focus for the inquiry. The bombing after an Ariana Grande concert killed 22 people and injured hundreds more Paul Greaney QC, counsel to the public inquiry, has said the relationship between Abdallah and Abedi seemed to have been of ""some significance in the period prior to the bombing and we are determined to get to the bottom of it"". Lawyers for bereaved families have said the ""failure to recognise the association between Salman Abedi and Abdalraouf Abdallah was a real missed opportunity"". Like Abdallah, the Abedi family have refused to answer questions posed by the inquiry, with eldest brother Ismail Abedi also asserting a claimed privilege against self-incrimination. It is understood that Abdallah's licence conditions will be similar to those imposed on the hate preacher Anjem Choudary,who was released on licence two years ago. The measures are understood to include: Being placed in supervised probation accommodation not in Manchester, wearing a GPS tag, obeying a curfew and reporting in several times a day, as well as engaging with the government's ""desistance and disengagement"" de-radicalisation scheme Barring him from Manchester city centre, where the inquiry is taking place, as well as Moss Side and surrounding areas in the south of the city, where he previously lived A ban on unsupervised internet use, limits on phone use, surrender of his passport, and not being allowed to give talks or sermons He will also not be allowed contact with any serving prisoner or anyone convicted of a terrorism offence, nor unsupervised contact with anyone under 18 There has been significant public debate over the past the year following attacks in London - atFishmongers' HallandStreatham- by recently released prisoners convicted of terror-related offences. An independent review has highlighted a catalogue of failings in how offenders are managed after release,making 45 recommendations for how the system needs to improve. A Ministry of Justice statement said: ""Terrorists released on licence are supervised by the probation service, with the support of police and the security services, and subject to strict conditions including restrictions on their internet use, movements and contact with others. ""If they break those conditions they can be brought back to prison.""

"Diego Maradona scored 34 goals in 91 appearances for Argentina Dazzling, infamous, extraordinary, genius, outrageous. Diego Maradona. A flawed football icon. One of the game's most gifted players, the Argentine boasted a rare combination of flair, flamboyance, vision and speed which mesmerised fans. He also outraged supporters with his controversial 'Hand of God' goal and plunged into a mire of drug abuse and personal crises off the pitch. Born 60 years ago in a Buenos Aires shanty town, Diego Armando Maradona escaped the poverty of his youth to become a football superstar considered by some to be even greater than Brazil's Pele. The Argentine, who scored 259 goals in 491 matches, pipped his South American rival in a poll to determine the greatest player of the 20th Century, before Fifa changed the voting rules so both players were honoured. Maradona showed prodigious ability from a young age, leading Los Cebollitas youth team to a 136-game unbeaten streak and going on to make his international debut aged just 16 years and 120 days. Short and stocky, at just 5ft 5in, he was not your typical athlete. But his silky skills, agility, vision, ball control, dribbling and passing more than compensated for lack of pace and occasional weight problems. He may have been a whizz at running rings round hostile defenders but he found it harder to dodge trouble. Maradona beat Shilton to the ball - and the goal was allowed to stand in 1986 Maradona's 34 goals in 91 appearances for Argentina tell only part of the story of his rollercoaster international career. He led his country to victory at the 1986 World Cup in Mexico and a place in the final four years later. In the quarter-final of the earlier tournament, there was a foretaste of the controversy that would later engulf his life. The match against England already had an extra friction, with the Falklands War between the two countries having taken place only four years beforehand. That on-field edge was to become even more intense. With 51 minutes gone and the game goalless, Maradona jumped with opposing goalkeeper Peter Shilton and scored by punching the ball into the net. This video can not be played Argentina legend Maradona explains his infamous 'Hand of God' goal He later said the goal came thanks to ""a little with the head of Maradona and a little with the hand of God"". Four minutes later, he scored what has been described as the 'goal of the century' - collecting the ball in his own half before embarking on a bewitching, mazy run that left several players trailing before he rounded Shilton to score. ""You have to say that is magnificent. There is no doubt about that goal. That was just pure football genius,"" said BBC commentator Barry Davies. England pulled one back but Argentina went through, with Maradona saying it was ""much more than winning a match, it was about knocking out the English"". Maradona broke the world transfer record twice - leaving Boca Juniors in his home country for Spanish side Barcelona for Â£3m in 1982 and joining Italian club Napoli two years later for Â£5m. There were more than 80,000 fans in the Stadio San Paolo when he arrived by helicopter. A new hero. He played the best club football of his career in Italy, feted by supporters as he inspired the side to their first league titles in 1987 and 1990 and the Uefa Cup in 1989. A party to celebrate the first triumph lasted five days with hundreds of thousands on the streets, but Maradona was suffocated by the attention and expectation. ""This is a great city but I can hardly breathe. I want to be free to walk around. I'm a lad like any other,"" he said. Maradona became an icon at Napoli, where he scored 81 times in 188 games He became inextricably linked to the Camorra crime syndicate, dragged down by a cocaine addiction and embroiled in a paternity suit. After losing 1-0 to Germany in the final of Italia 90, a positive dope test the following year triggered a 15-month ban. He returned and arrested his slide, appearing to get his act together to play in the 1994 World Cup in the USA. But he alarmed viewers with a maniacal full-face goal celebration into a camera and was withdrawn midway through the tournament after he was found to have taken the banned substance ephedrine. Maradona timeline 1977:Debut for Argentina v Hungary 1991:15-month ban after positive drugs test 1984:Joins Napoli after two-year spell with Barcelona 1994:Plays in fourth World Cup but is ejected after positive test 1986:Wins World Cup with Argentina 1997:Retires from playing after third positive test 1990:World Cup runner-up with Argentina. Second league title at Napoli 2010:Ends two-year spell as Argentina manager after World Cup quarter-final exit After his third positive test three years later, he retired from football on his 37th birthday, but continued to be plagued by problems. Maradona was given a suspended jail sentence of two years and 10 months for an earlier incident where he shot at  journalists with an air rifle. His cocaine habit and alcoholism led to several health issues. He put on weight, rising to 128kg (20 stone) at one point, and suffered a major heart attack in 2004, which left him in intensive care. He had gastric-bypass surgery to help stem his obesity, and  sought sanctuary in Cuba while battling to overcome his drug addiction. Maradona visited Cuba and met president Fidel Castro Despite all this, Maradona was named manager of the Argentina national team in 2008 and took the side to the World Cup quarter-finals two years later before his reign ended with a 4-0 defeat by Germany in the quarter-finals. Various managerial roles followed for a figure who continued to divide opinion, and continued to make headlines. He needed reconstructive surgery on his lip after one of his pet shar pei dogs bit him, and publicly recognised his son Diego Armando Junior who was born from an extra-marital affair. A snapshot of his chaotic lifestyle came when he attended Argentina's match against Nigeria at the 2018 World Cup in Russia. He unveiled a banner of himself, danced with a Nigeria fan, prayed to the heavens before the game, wildly celebrated Lionel Messi's opener, fell asleep and gave a double middle finger salute after Argentina's second goal. Some reports suggested he needed medical treatment afterwards. Disgraceful, inspired, entertaining, great, over the top. Diego Maradona. A life less ordinary.

"Police Federation chairman John Apter called the pay freeze a ""disgrace"" Union leaders have reacted with fury after Chancellor Rishi Sunak imposed a pay freeze on at least 1.3 million public sector workers. The GMB union said it had fought a public sector pay cap before ""and we busted it"", while the civil service and rail unions warned of strike action. Frontline NHS staff and lower paid workers will get pay rises, Mr Sunak said in Wednesday's Spending Review. But Mr Sunak said rises for others in the public sector were being ""paused."" This includes civil servants, teachers, police, firefighters, the armed forces, and council staff Rehana Azam, national officer of the GMB union, said the freeze ""will hit key workers who have risked everything during the pandemic"". ""This attempt to divide and rule will put him on a direct collision course with public service workers, and he should know that we fought the public sector pay cap before and we busted it,"" she said. ""GMB will not accept more pay cuts for our members at a time when the whole country is relying on them. Economic emergency has only just begun, says Sunak Low-paid public sector workers to get Â£250 pay rise Millions face cut in value of company pensions Mark Serwotka, general secretary of the Public and Commercial Services union (PCS) said: ""Civil servants and other public sector staff will feel a deep sense of betrayal at today's pay freeze. ""Despite keeping the country running during the Covid crisis, supplying Universal Credit and helping businesses access the furlough scheme, the chancellor has justified a pay freeze by pointing to lower wages in the private sector."" He said the news ""has intensified long-standing anger at a decade of pay restraint and increased the likelihood of industrial unrest in the public sector."" Mick Cash, leader of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union (RMT), also warned that members will ""have no hesitation in taking strike action"", while Unison general secretary Dave Prentis said: ""This is austerity, plain and simple."" Rishi Sunak said he was targeting resources at those who needed it most Other union leaders also lined up to condemn the freeze, including Unite, Prospect, and the Fire Brigades Union. The Treasury has estimated that the pay announcement will directly affect 1.3 million workers, less than 25% of the total number of 5.5 million in the public sector. However, that figure mainly covers people working for central government. The total rise could be much higher if local government and devolved pay agreements are frozen. In his Spending Review, Mr Sunak highlighted a disparity between public sector and private sector wages, adding he ""cannot justify a significant, across-the-board"" pay increase for all public sector workers in the circumstances. ""Instead, we are targeting our resources at those who need it most,"" he said. He said 2.1 million public sector workers earning below the median wage of Â£24,000 were ""guaranteed a pay rise of at least Â£250"". More than a million NHS workers will also get a raise, he said. Meanwhile, the National Living Wage will increase by 2.2% - or 19p - to Â£8.91 an hour, with the rate extended to 23 and 24 year olds for the first time.
