"Mr Maassen works in the shadows - but now he is in the spotlight Germany's domestic intelligence chief, Hans-Georg Maassen, has been told to quit and move to a senior post at the interior ministry. The government decision came amid a row over Mr Maassen's response to far-right unrest in Chemnitz, eastern Germany. Anti-migrant ""hunts"" were reported there on 26 August after a German man was killed in a brawl with migrants. Mr Maassen doubted that foreign-looking people had been hounded. Chancellor Angela Merkel was urged to sack him. Critics said his scepticism downplayed the seriousness of far-right violence and intimidation in Chemnitz. Mr Maassen will leave the BfV spy service and become a state secretary in the interior ministry. German media report that he will actually move to a higher pay grade. It is not yet clear who will replace him. Several xenophobic assaults were reported in the eastern city after the fatal stabbing of Daniel Hillig. They were described as racist ""hunts"", and images emerged showing demonstrators chasing people and flinging bottles and fireworks. Controversially, spy chief Mr Maassen said hisFederal Office for Constitutional Protection (BfV),external- which is similar to the British MI5 - had ""no reliable information about such hunts taking place"" in Chemnitz. He also questioned whether a video posted by ""Antifa Zeckenbiss"" - meaning ""anti-fascist tick bite"" - really showed, as claimed, a ""hunt in Chemnitz"" on 26 August. Allow Twitter content?

"A 14-month-old child suffering from malnutrition receives treatment at a clinic in the city of Amran A further one million children are at risk of famine in Yemen, the charity Save the Children has warned. Rising food prices and the falling value of the country's currency as a result of a civil war are putting more families at risk of food insecurity. But another threat comes from fighting around the key port city of Hudaydah, which is the principal lifeline for almost two-thirds of the population. Save the Children says a total of 5.2 million children now face famine. Yemen's civilians pay price of blockade Witnessing Yemen's desperate suffering Why battle for Yemen's Hudaydah matters This video can not be played The conflict in Yemen has been raging for years - but what is it all about? Yemen has been devastated by a conflict that escalated in early 2015, when the rebel Houthi movement seized control of much of the west of the country and forced President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi to flee abroad. Alarmed by the rise of a group they saw as an Iranian proxy, Saudi Arabia and eight other Arab states intervened in an attempt to restore the government. They have received logistical and intelligence support from the US, UK and France. Many families in rebel-held Yemen are reliant on food handouts from aid groups At least 6,660 civilians have been killed and 10,563 injured in the conflict, according to the UN. Thousands more civilians have died from preventable causes, including malnutrition, disease and poor health. The fighting and a partial blockade by the coalition have also left 22 million people in need of humanitarian aid, created the world's largest food security emergency, and led to a cholera outbreak that is thought to have affected 1.1 million people. The war has also led to severe delays in paying the salaries of teachers and public servants, with some people receiving no wages for almost two years. Those who are paid face food prices which are 68% more expensive than when the war began. This video can not be played The BBC travels deep into rebel held Yemen, to see starvation caused by war Meanwhile, the Yemeni riyal has lost almost 180% of its value over the same period, according to Save the Children. Earlier this month, the currency reached its lowest value in history, placing a further burden on population. Fears also remain of potential damage to or a blockade of Hudaydah's port as a result of the fighting. The UN has warned that in a worst-case scenario, the battle for Hudaydah could cost up to 250,000 lives, as well as cut off aid supplies to millions of people living in rebel-held areas. Families of bus strike victims despair at global response Yemen conflict: Who is fighting whom? Ending Yemenâs never-ending war ""Millions of children don't know when or if their next meal will come,"" the chief executive of Save the Children International, Helle Thorning-Schmidt, said in a statement. ""In one hospital I visited in north Yemen, the babies were too weak to cry, their bodies exhausted by hunger. Hudaydah's port is the lifeline for just under two-thirds of Yemen's population ""This war risks killing an entire generation of Yemen's children who face multiple threats, from bombs to hunger to preventable diseases like cholera,"" she added. Earlier this month, Save the Children said that more than 36,000 children could die from extreme hunger before the end of the year.

"This video can not be played The bus crashed into a branch of Sainsbury's A bus driver who crashed into a shop, killing two people, was driving dangerously when he caused the deaths, a trial of facts has found. The double-decker bus driven by Kailash Chander smashed into a Sainsbury's supermarket in October 2015. Rowan Fitzgerald, seven, and Dora Hancox, 76, died when the bus crashed in Trinity Street, Coventry. Mr Chander, 80, from Leamington Spa, was judged unfit to plead or stand trial at Birmingham Crown Court. The former town mayor was diagnosed with dementia after the crash. The court heard Mr Chander had been warned about his ""erratic"" driving by bus company Midland Red after four crashes in the previous three years. He had worked for more than 70 hours in the week leading up to the crash. Mr Chander mistook the accelerator for the brake before the fatal smash, prosecutors said. Kailash Chander has been judged medically unfit to enter a plea or stand trial He had also been the subject of eight warning letters triggered by a ""spy-in-the-cab"" system installed by Midland Red in 2014 to monitor braking, acceleration and speeding. Seven months before the crash, Mr Chander was referred to the company's driving school, which sent an anonymous assessor to report on his driving. The instructor said the journey was ""uncomfortable and erratic"" and ""would not have been good enough"" to pass an initial training driving test. Midlands Live: Addresses searched in terror investigation; Prince William visit - ""he's not the ginger one"" Jurors were also shown CCTV footage of Mr Chander - who struggled to punch a ticket moments before the crash as his hands were shaking - steering the bus as it careered over a pavement into the supermarket. Passenger Casper Mudenhatold the court it felt like ""the bus was out of control"". Rowan, a primary school pupil from Leamington, died of a head injury. He had been sitting at the front of the upper deck at the time of the crash on 3 October 2015. Rowan Fitzgerald attended St Anthony's Catholic Primary School in Leamington Spa In a statement Rowan's family said ""no sentence would ever stop the hurt that we feel"" for his loss and called for a change in the law preventing people driving buses in old age. Pedestrian Ms Hancox, from Nuneaton, was struck by the bus and a falling lamppost. Jurors deliberated for around three hours on Tuesday before finding Mr Chander was driving dangerously when he caused the two deaths and serious injury to two other passengers, including Rowan's eight-year-old cousin. They were not asked to return verdicts of guilty because Mr Chander was mentally unfit to take part in the hearing. Mr Chander's dementia diagnosis meant he was deemed unfit to plea or stand trial His dementia diagnosis may have meant he was unable to ""break out"" of a state of hyper-vigilance as he pressed the accelerator instead of the brake. The court also heard while no brake lights were seen during the 12-second journey of the bus, the lights became illuminated seven seconds after the crash. He had experienced suicidal thoughts, was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder and depression, and was ""very preoccupied"" by the crash, the court heard. The jury was instead invited to rule on whether Mr Chander ""did the acts"" alleged. Dora Hancox was one of two people killed in the crash Defence lawyers acting for Mr Chander had argued his conduct was careless because it did not fall far below the standard expected of a competent driver. But prosecution QC Andrew Thomas told the jury: ""In the scale of driver errors, nothing could be more obvious, and nothing could be more devastating, than putting your foot down on the throttle pedal and accelerating over a prolonged period of time when you are supposed to be braking."" This video can not be played CCTV captures Coventry bus crash which killed two people Mr Chander could face a supervision order at a further hearing due to take place in November. Bus company Midland Red (South), which has pleaded guilty to health and safety law breaches, faces an unlimited fine and will be sentenced on Friday. A spokesman said: ""We are deeply sorry for the heartache of those affected, particularly the families of Rowan Fitzgerald and Dora Hancox."" A member of the public who saw the bus speeding towards the supermarket and told pedestrians to get out of the way has been commended for bravery by the police. ""I am certain that his bravery on the day saved many other lives,"" Sgt Alan Wood said of 35-year-old Tiel Portlock, who can be seen waving his arms urging people to move in CCTV footage of the crash.

"Mylee Billingham died after being found stabbed at her father's home A man stabbed his ""trusting and defenceless"" eight-year-old daughter to death after threatening to kill her mother, a court has heard. Mylee Billingham died after being found with a knife wound to her chest at her father's home near Walsall in January. William Billingham, 55, was struggling to cope with his ex-partner's decision to start a relationship with another woman, Birmingham Crown Court was told. He denies murder and making a threat to kill. Midlands Live: Railway worker 'trapped in machinery'; Fire engulfs 1930s cinema Opening the case, prosecutor Karim Khalil QC said moments before Mylee was attacked on 20 January, Tracey Taundry had arrived to collect her daughter from Mr Billingham's house in Valley View, Brownhills. ""Whilst at the front door the defendant threatened to kill Tracey with the same knife and she had run off a short distance,"" he said. Mr Billingham met Miss Taundry when she was 19 and he was 40 and the relationship had initially caused tensions between her and his older children, the court heard. In 2010 she called police alleging he had struck her and thrown things around their flat, but she chose not pursue charges. Miss Taundry's bisexuality had often been a cause for light-hearted banter between her and Mr Billingham, the court heard. She met a woman who became her regular partner and the prosecutor said the fact this seemed to be getting more serious was something the defendant ""seemed to be struggling to deal with"". Mr Khalil told the jury: ""We say his actions were plainly hostile to this new situation."" Mr Billingham eventually moved out, with Miss Taundry describing them as initially remaining ""friends with benefits"". Mr Khalil said jury members were likely to have to consider Mr Billingham's mental state when Mylee was fatally injured at his house. ""The defendant did provide an account in interview of the time leading up to these terrible events, but he claimed to have no memory of the events themselves,"" he said. ""He has therefore provided little by way of explanation for what he did. ""Whether or not he can remember the events does not affect his responsibility for them."" The trial continues.

"These ads were among those directed only at men on Facebook, according to the complaint Van driving, roofing, police work - all jobs for men. At least, thatâs what a cluster of job ads placed on Facebook seemed to suggest. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) on Tuesdaysubmitted a complaint,externalto the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) alleging that Facebookâs advertising system allows employers to target job ads based on gender - a practice the ACLU says is illegal. Specifically, the complaint refers to three women in the states of Ohio, Pennsylvania and Illinois who were not shown advertisements for what have traditionally been considered male-dominated professions. The complaint highlights 10 different employers who posted job adverts on Facebook - for roles such as mechanic, roofer and security engineer - but used the social networkâs targeting system to control who saw the ad. In one example, that targeting meant one job was promoted to âmenâ who were âages 25 to 35â, and lived ""or were recently near Philadelphia, Pennsylvaniaâ. A separate investigation by ProPublica,externaldiscovered what it said were more examples showing a similar pattern. Earlier this year the investigative journalism site released a tool which readers could use to collect data on the Facebook ads they had seen, and send that information directly to ProPublica for analysis. Using that method, the site said it discovered men were targeted specifically in dozens of cities around the US for driving jobs with Uber. This conclusion was based on 91 ads placed by Uber's recruitment arm, only one of which was targeted specifically at women, with three not targeting any particular gender. The rest were designed to be seen by men only. In a statement, Uber said: ""We use a variety of channels to reach prospective drivers - both offline and online - with the goal of enabling more people, not fewer, to earn on their own schedule."" However, this data should be treated with caution. It is not clear that any broad conclusions can be made about perceived discrimination on Facebook. While one advertisement in isolation may be targeting men specifically, there may have been an equivalent advertisement targeting women running in the same time frame - ads that may not have been picked up by ProPublica's tool. Furthermore, if a user clicks on an ad to see why it has been targeted - as in the ACLU complaint - they will be told why they specifically saw the ad, but not details on the entire audience for the ad. The BBC understands Facebook is in the process of putting together data to dispute the findings and respond to the ACLU's complaint. While targeting users based on gender may seem relatively harmless when it comes to, for instance, clothing brands, doing so for job advertisements may be against US law. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 specifically prohibits discriminating against a person because of ""race, colour, religion, sex, or national originâ. The law applies to every stage of employment, including recruitment. Facebook said it was looking into the complaint ""When employers in male-dominated fields advertise their jobs only to men, it prevents women from breaking into those fields,â said Galen Sherwin, from the ACLUâs Womenâs Rights Project, arguing that ânon-binaryâ people, those who choose not to identify with a specific gender, are also excluded. ""Whatâs more, clicking on the Facebook ads brought viewers to a page listing numerous other job opportunities at these companies for which job seekers might be qualified. ""Because no women saw these ads, they were shut out of learning not only about the jobs highlighted in the ads, but also about any of these other opportunities.â Facebook said it was reviewing the ACLUâs complaint and looked forward to âdefending our practicesâ. ""There is no place for discrimination on Facebook,â said spokesman Joe Osborne. ""Itâs strictly prohibited in our policies, and over the past year, weâve strengthened our systems to further protect against misuse.â The company has recently removed over 5,000 targeting options for advertisers. The move was prompted by a lawsuit accusing the firm of unlawfully targeting users based on race or sexual orientation.

"Khalid Masood drove his hire car into pedestrians before crashing it into the railings around Parliament Security at the Palace of Westminster ""completely failed"" the unarmed police officer killed in the terror attack on its grounds, an inquest has heard. Khalid Masood stabbed PC Keith Palmer to death on 22 March 2017 in New Palace Yard, after mowing down and killing four pedestrians on Westminster Bridge. The latest instructions for armed officers told them to focus on the gate where PC Palmer was stationed. But the Old Bailey inquest heard this system had ""not functioned for years"". PC Lee Ashby - one of two authorised firearms officers (AFOs) on duty in the yard at the time of the attack - said he would have fired at Masood if he had had a clear shot from a fixed post at the gate. Instead, he and his colleague PC Nicholas Sanders were positioned at the other side of the yard where they could not see or hear the carnage unfolding, and no AFOs had been near the gates for almost an hour. It meant Masood was able to run from his car towards the Houses of Parliament, where he was confronted by PC Palmer. After stabbing the officer to death, Masood was shot and killed by armed police. PC Ashby, an experienced marksman, accepted it was not possible to provide effective cover for the gates on his patrol and agreed the system left unarmed officers unprotected at the entrance ""more often than not"". He said an opportunity to save PC Palmer's life had ""possibly"" been lost. PC Ashby said he was responsible for patrolling ""sector three"" of the courtyard, which included the Members' Entrance, Carriage Gates and College Green. The court heard that the most recent instructions for New Palace Yard dated from 2015 and ordered them to focus on the Carriage Gates. But PC Ashby told the Old Bailey he had never seen the up-to-date ""post instructions"" for where to be stationed and that officers worked from a map posted on a wall that dated from 2012. An email chain, which included the chief inspector of operations for the palace, Nick Aldworth, revealed concerns had been raised over the positioning of armed officers as early as February 2015. PC Ashby said he was unaware of the guidance and instead followed instructions given by his sergeants in daily briefings. The lawyer representing PC Palmer's widow Michelle, Dominic Adamson, said: ""The system of security at the Palace of Westminster completely failed to protect PC Palmer on that day?"" PC Ashby said: ""It would seem so, sir."" The barrister continued: ""Because it had not functioned for years?"" ""Based on the sector three map, which I was responsible for, yes,"" the officer replied. Westminster attack: What happened Victims of the Westminster terror attack Who was attacker Khalid Masood? PC Ashby and his colleague PC Nicholas Sanders faced a misconduct investigation after the attack but no formal action was taken. The investigation highlighted ""poor practice"" from a ""misjudged interpretation"" of what they were allowed to do on patrol, but said ""this practice was not unique to these officers"". Mr Adamson suggested it was an ""extraordinary situation"" where armed officers ""had no idea what they were supposed to be doing"" and that ""lax"" security arrangements had persisted for years. ""The sector area, sector three, was too big, too large for two officers,"" PC Ashby replied. Earlier, the inquest heard from pathologists on how the victims from the bridge had been killed. Kurt Cochran, 54, Leslie Rhodes, 75, Aysha Frade, 44, and Andreea Cristea, 31, were all hit by Masood's car. Consultant pathologist Ashley Fegan-Earl told the inquest the vehicle was as ""lethal as a knife or a gun"" and caused them ""unsurvivable"" injuries. Ms Cristea, an interior designer from Romania, was thrown 10ft into the air after being hit by the car, then fell 41ft into the River Thames below. She had been lying face down and unconscious in the water for five minutes before being pulled out and died in hospital two weeks later. Mr Fegan-Earl said her head injuries were ""highly likely"" to have killed her, even if she had not gone into the water. Asked if she might have survived if she had been lifted out of the water sooner by the crew of a tourist boat, he answered: ""I suspect not."" Clockwise from top left - PC Keith Palmer, Aysha Frade, Leslie Rhodes, Andreea Cristea and Kurt Cochran all lost their lives American tourist Mr Cochran pushed his wife Melissa out of the way moments before he was hit and fell head-first over a railing and onto the pavement, the court heard. He suffered multiple bruises, fractures and brain injuries and his ""survival period would have been brief"", said pathologist Dr Simon Poole. A lawyer for Mr Cochran's sister asked why medics had not given him chest compressions at the scene, and whether it could have made a difference. Dr Poole said: ""I don't think so."" He added that the seriousness of Mr Cochran's head injuries were ""unsurvivable"". The inquest heard Mr Rhodes also suffered a ""devastating"" head injury when he was struck by the car, before being thrown onto the road. He was taken to King's College Hospital in London but died around 24 hours later. Dr Fegan-Earl said: ""The injury was devastating, unsurvivable and, in my opinion, it would have rendered him deeply unconscious straight away. ""There was no issue with the medical treatment he received and the formal cause of death was given as head injury."" Asked if Mr Rhodes could have survived if he had been transported by air ambulance, he replied, ""In my opinion, no."" Ms Frade's death ""would have been near instantaneous and in my opinion without suffering"" when she was struck from behind, thrown into the air and under the wheels of a double-decker bus, said Dr Fegan-Earl. He said she suffered a ""devastating, unsurvivable head injury"", as well as ""devastating internal injuries"" and fractures to her lower limbs. She would have been rendered unconscious immediately when she was hit, he added.

"Police said the cordon in the centre of Salisbury was a ""precautionary measure"" Two people who fell ill in a restaurant in Salisbury were not exposed to any kind of nerve agent, police have said. Wiltshire Police declared a major incident after a man, 42, and a woman, 30, became ill at Prezzo in High Street on Sunday evening. The force has now said the incident was ""not being treated as suspicious"" following tests on the pair. A spokesman said: ""We are not linking their illness to the recent poisonings in Salisbury and Amesbury."" Inquiries into what caused the man and woman to fall ill are ongoing. A cordon around Prezzo remains in place and tests are continuing In March, Russian Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia collapsed in Salisbury having been exposed to the nerve agent Novichok. After weeks in hospital they were released, but in June two Amesbury residents fell ill after being exposed to the same nerve agent.Dawn Sturgess, 44, diedand a murder inquiry was launched. Russian spy poisoning: What we know so far What are Novichok nerve agents? The UK government has accused two Russian men, Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov, of attempting to kill the Skripals.

"The Il-20 aircraft was returning to a Russian base on the north-western coast of Syria (file photo) The leaders of Russia and Israel have sought to defuse tension after a Russian plane was shot down by Syrian forces amid an Israeli air raid. In a call to Vladimir Putin, Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu expressed regret at the loss of 15 Russian personnel, but stressed again that Syria was to blame. Mr Putin had earlier called the incident ""a chain of tragic accidental circumstances"". The Il-20 plane was downed over the Mediterranean Sea on Monday evening. What will be the fallout of the Russian deaths? A tour of Syria - with the Russian military Russia is supporting President Bashar al-Assad in Syria's civil war. Mr Putin and Mr Netanyahu spoke by telephone on Monday, shortly after the Russian president had made his conciliatory statement in Moscow. Mr Putin said at a media briefing: ""It looks most likely in this case that it was a chain of tragic chance events, because an Israeli aircraft did not shoot down our aircraft. But, without any doubt we need to seriously get the bottom of what happened."" Mr Netanyahu addressed that issue in the telephone call, offering to provide ""all necessary information"" in the investigation of the incident, as well as expressing regret over the fatalities. In the call, Mr Putin urged Mr Netanyahu ""not to let such a situation happen in the future"" and told him Israeli air operations breached Syrian sovereignty, Russian media said. Russia's Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu had earlier said that Moscow ""reservesÂ the right to take further steps in response"". But Mr Putin said the ""retaliatory measures"" would be ""aimed first and foremost at further ensuring the safety of our military personnel"". The BBC's defence and diplomatic correspondent, Jonathan Marcus, says the crisis will almost certainly blow over as Israel and Russia have a remarkably close relationship and Moscow has until now not interfered with Israeli operations. Russia's Tass news agency said an Ilyushin Il-20 reconnaissance plane had ""disappeared during an attack by four Israeli F-16 jets on Syrian facilities in Latakia province"". Photos 'reveal' Russia jet damage at Hmeimim base Why is there a war in Syria? The downing was reported to have occurred about 35km (22 miles) from the Syrian coast as the Il-20 aircraft was returning to Russia's Hmeimim airbase near Latakia. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said its aircraft were targeting Syrian military facilities ""from which systems to manufacture accurate and lethal weapons were about to be transferred on behalf of Iran to Hezbollah in Lebanon"". The Lebanese Shia militant group and Iran are both allies of the Syrian government. Israel has reportedly hit more than 200 Iranian targets in Syria over the past 18 months. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group said some Israeli missiles did find the target and two people were killed on the ground. However, it could not confirm their identity and Syria has made no official comment. Both the Russians and Israelis agree it was Syrian anti-aircraft fire, although Syria has not commented. Russia said it was given less than a minute's warning by Israel ahead of the strikes, which was not enough time to get the military surveillance plane out of the way. It also said the Israeli planes had ""used the Russian airplane as a cover"", putting it ""in the line of fire coming from Syrian air defence systems"". Israel disputes this.In a rare statement detailing its operations over Syria,external, the IDF said: ""The Russian plane that was hit was not within the area of the operation... when the Syrian army launched the missiles that hit the Russian plane, (Israeli) jets were already within Israeli airspace."" The Russian defence ministry said body fragments, personal belongings and the plane's debris had been found by search ships in the Mediterranean on Tuesday. Israel was adamant. The IDF said: ""Israel holds the Assad regime, whose military shot down the Russian plane, fully responsible for this incident."" The statement also laid blame on Iran and Hezbollah. In his phone call with Mr Putin, Mr Netanyahu insisted that Israel would continue to target Iran inside Syria. Russia and Turkey to create Syria buffer zone In an initial statement, Russia said: ""The Israeli planes deliberately created a dangerous situation for surface ships and aircraft in the area. ""As a result of the irresponsible actions by the Israeli military, 15 Russian servicemen have died."" Analysis by Jonathan Marcus, BBC Defence Correspondent Russia is clearly angry. It has lost an aircraft and the lives of its 15-person crew. It needs to register its displeasure but is also reluctant to condemn its regional ally Syria. Israel and Russia have a remarkably close relationship and a clear understanding about Israel Defense Forces (IDF) operations in the region. So might this episode change this? I think that is doubtful. For one thing the air campaign in Syria is seen by Israel as a vital strategic necessity to thwart, as they see it, Iran's growing influence. And for Russia to try to physically interfere with Israeli operations would go entirely against the policy pursued by Moscow up till now. Read more from Jonathan Russia began military strikes in Syria in 2015 after a request from President Assad, who has stayed in power despite seven years of civil war which has so far killed more than 350,000 people. Hmeimim is Russia's main base for air strikes on rebel groups in Syria - strikes that have enabled President Assad's forces to recover much lost ground since 2015. Russia says its air strikes only target ""terrorists"", but activists have said they mainly hit mainstream rebel fighters and civilians. According to The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group, at least 7,928 civilians and 10,069 combatants have been killed in Russian strikes. Russia has also suffered personnel losses, including the deaths of 39 people whena Russian military transport plane crashed as it attempted to landat Hmeimim in March.

"A photograph of a boy weeping next to his father's body moved Indian social media users to raise more than three million rupees ($43,829; Â£33,350) for his family in a day.

By some estimates, about 100 sewer workers die in India every year. Unions have alleged that this is because they are not given proper safety equipment. Shiv Sunny, a reporter at The Hindustan Times, who tweeted the picture on Monday, told the BBC that he was ""shaken"" by the sight of the man's grieving son, who is 11. Allow Twitter content?

He added that while even Bollywood actors reached out to him to ask how they could help Anil's family, what was really moving was that poorer people had donated sums of money as small as 10 rupees. The numerous questions and comments about the family on social media prompted him to go back and find out more about them. Mr Sunny also spoke to the grieving son, who told him that he would sometimes accompany his father to work and ""wait outside guarding his clothes and shoes from thieves"". ""My father would say it still wasn't yet time for me to enter the sewers,"" Mr Sunny quoted the boy as saying in the Hindustan Times. Police told the NDTV news website that an investigation into Anil's death had revealed thatthe rope was not strong enough and that Anil had not been wearing protective gear,external.

"Staff at McDonald's restaurants in 10 US cities walked out on Tuesday over claims the fast food giant is not doing enough to prevent sexual harassment. The strike comes after 27 women filed complaints against the chain, alleging it failed to enforce company rules against abuse. The women said they were ignored after reporting incidents including groping, indecent exposure and lewd comments. McDonald's said there was ""no place for harassment"" at its restaurants. The strike was planned to last for one hour around lunch time and targeted multiple restaurants in cities including Chicago, Los Angeles and Miami. Hundreds of cashiers and cooks walked out, protest organisers said. They were joined by other labour activists. Has #MeToo divided women? How can businesses tackle sexual harassment? McDonald's has a company-wide sexual harassment policy but the protestors - who are backed by the Time's Up Legal Defense Fund - want to see improvements. They say procedures for responding to harassment complaints are inadequate and that all staff should undergo anti-harassment training. Since 2016, more than two dozen McDonald's workers have filed complaints with the US National Labor Relations Board, alleging their reports of harassment were ignored, mocked or met with retaliation. The complaints named both McDonald's franchisees and the company itself. However, the firm regards its franchisees as independent business owners. In one example, Breauna Morrow, a 15-year-old cashier in St Louis, said that she had been ""repeatedly harassed"" by a co-worker using ""graphic, sexual language"". However, when she reported the incident her ""supervisors did nothing"". In another incident, an employee said she had reported being groped by a co-worker at a New Orleans outlet. Instead of taking action, her managers mocked the woman and said ""she was probably giving the worker 'sex appeal'"". McDonald's spokeswoman Andrea Abate said: ""We have policies, procedures and training in place that are specifically designed to prevent sexual harassment at our company and company-owned restaurants, and we firmly believe that our franchisees share this commitment."" McDonald's also continues to face pressure from labour unions over the wages it pays it staff. The Fight for $15, a national movement seeking to increase the minimum wage, has been pressurising the chain to increase wages and improve working conditions. The campaign also helped to organise Tuesday's protest. How can businesses tackle sexual harassment? Has a feminist movement divided women?

"Pyotr Verzilov arrived in Berlin on a special medical transport plane An activist with Russian protest group Pussy Riot who was taken ill after a court hearing last week was probably the victim of a poisoning attempt, German doctors treating him have said. Pyotr Verzilov, 30, was flown to Berlin from Moscow on Saturday after arriving at hospital in a serious condition. His symptoms reportedly included losing his sight and the ability to speak. Mr Verzilov is best known for taking part in a protest at the Football World Cup Final earlier this year.

Mr Verzilov holds both Russian and Canadian citizenship. Earlier this week Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the situation was a ""concern, obviously, given actions of recent months by the Russians in the UK"" -referring to the poisoning of a Russian ex-spy and others in Salisbury. Mr Verzilov's case is not the first suspected poisoning of those who have criticised the Kremlin or senior Russian figures. Russian authorities often blame their symptoms on medical conditions or allergic reactions. 2017:Pro-democracy journalist Vladimir Kara-Murza survives a suspected poisoning, two years after he suffered multiple organ failure in a similar incident. 2004:Ukraine's former President Viktor Yushchenko is poisoned with toxic chemical dioxin while running against Russia's preferred candidate.

"MPs will have ""multiple"" opportunities to give the public the final say over whether the UK leaves the EU, the People's Vote campaign group has said. Theresa May has ruled out a referendum on the outcome of the Brexit negotiations under any circumstances. But People's Vote said there were six plausible scenarios in which Parliament could legislate for another vote. It said there should be a choice for voters between leaving with or without a deal or staying on current terms. The prime minister says the UK made its choice to leave in 2016 and that her plan for future co-operation with the EU - based on the Chequers blueprint agreed in July - respects the referendum result. She has said the choice facing Parliament is between leaving with or without a comprehensive agreement. But in a report calledRoadmap to a People's Vote,externalthe group campaigning for a referendum on any Brexit deal said there were no practical or legal barriers to giving the public the final say through a referendum and urged MPs not to hide behind ""logistical arguments"". Brexit is not inevitable - Cable It's my Brexit deal or no deal, May says Kuenssberg: Taking stock The British public voted to leave the EU by a margin of 51.89% to 48.11% in a referendum in June 2016. The UK is scheduled to leave on 29 March 2019, under the terms of the two-year Article 50 process. Negotiations on the terms of the UK's withdrawal, the so-called divorce settlement, as well as the shape of future relations between the two sides are now at a critical stage. European leaders meeting in Salzburg on Wednesday are expected to agree to hold a special summit in November at which any deal sealed in the next six weeks could be approved. Parliament will then be expected to vote on the terms of any agreement before the end of the year. People's Vote said this Commons showdown, when it happened, could be a catalyst for securing a referendum. The six ways it believes a referendum could be delivered are: Using a Commons motion when MPs vote on a Brexit deal the government has negotiated If MPs reject the deal or there is no deal by 21 January 2019 If MPs approve the deal - by amending the necessary legislation to make it conditional on a referendum Theresa May could decide to call a referendum herself if MPs reject the deal She might also call one if there's no deal, in the hope of securing a mandate to take the UK out of the EU on that basis In the ""possible chaos"" of a snap general election called by Mrs May or any possible successor Lord Kerr, the former top civil servant who wrote the report, said MPs who wanted a referendum faced a ""high bar"" given the government's control of the Parliamentary timetable. But he pointed out that Mrs May, who relies on the Democratic Unionist Party for her slim Commons majority, had already suffered two Brexit defeats and if Parliament did not act ""it will not be due to procedural impediments or a lack of time but because MPs have not chosen to take these opportunities"". Theresa May has said a new referendum will not be held in any circumstances The cross-bench peer said the government could easily seek an extension of the Article 50 process to allow for a referendum by ""withdrawing"" the letter sent on 29 March 2017 notifying the EU of its intention to leave. ""The die is not irrevocably cast,"" he wrote. ""There is still time. If there is a majority in Parliament for a People's Vote, there are multiple routes to securing one and, as the process unfolds, more opportunities for the House of Commons to assert its will may emerge."" In terms of what question would be asked, People's Vote said it did not rule out having three options on the ballot paper - namely any deal agreed by the two sides, leaving without a deal or staying in on current terms. But it said this was unlikely to get the backing of MPs and a ""binary choice"" between two options would be clearer, simpler and quicker. While there was a case for giving 16-year olds the vote and allowing EU nationals living in the UK to take part, it said there might be ""practical limits"" on any changes to the franchise given the timescale involved. The Lib Dems, the SNP and a growing number of Labour MPs back the idea of a referendum but Jeremy Corbyn has not committed to one as yet and only a handful of Tories support it.

"China has hit back at President Donald Trump by announcing new trade tariffs on $60bn of US goods. It comes after the US slapped duties on $200bn of Chinese imports to take effect from next Monday, escalating its trade war with Beijing. China will target goods such as liquefied natural gas, produced in states loyal to the US president. However, in a tweet, Mr Trump warned Beijing against seeking to influence the upcoming US midterm elections. ""There will be great and fast economic retaliation against China if our farmers, ranchers and/or industrial workers are targeted!"" he said. Earlier he had suggested that this would mean further US tariffs on another $267bn worth of Chinese products. Such a move would mean roughly all of China's exports to the US would be subject to new duties. The Chinese commerce ministry said it would impose its tariffs from 24 September - the date the US duties come into effect - but at lower rates than previously expected. It will place an additional 5% in duty on US products including smaller aircraft, computers and textiles, and an extra 10% on goods such as chemicals, meat, wheat and wine. By contrast, the US duties will apply to almost 6,000 items, making them the biggest round of trade tariffs yet from Washington. They will affect handbags, rice and textiles, although some items such as smart watches and high chairs have been exempted. They will start at 10% and increase to 25% from the start of next year unless the two countries agree a deal. China and trade: Playing dirty or misunderstood victim? Trade wars, tariffs and protectionism explained The early victims of Trump's trade war Trade row: What has happened so far? Six ways China could retaliate in a trade war On Monday Mr Trump said the latest round of tariffs was in response to China's ""unfair trade practices"". ""We have been very clear about the type of changes that need to be made, and we have given China every opportunity to treat us more fairly. But, so far, China has been unwilling to change its practices,"" he said. Yes. In fact, the latest round of US duties marks the third set of tariffs put into motion so far this year. In July, the White House increased charges on $34bn worth of Chinese products. Then last month, the escalating trade war moved up a gear whenthe US brought in a 25% tax on a second wave of goods worth $16bn. This latest round means that about half of all Chinese imports to the US are now subject to the new duties. Unlike the earlier rounds, the list also targets consumer goods such as luggage and furniture. That means households may start to feel the impact from higher prices. US companies have already said they are worried about the effect of higher costs on their businesses and warned of the risk of job cuts. Trump tariffs will hurt global growth, IMF warns Will Trump's tariffs stop Chinese espionage? Many everyday items such as suitcases, handbags, toilet paper and wool are included in this latest round of tariffs. The list also includes food items,externalfrom frozen cuts of meat, to almost all types of fish, soybeans, various types of fruit and cereal and rice. The Apple Watch is one of the items to escape the tariffs The list of Chinese products slated for tariffs originally included more than 6,000 items, but US officials later removed about 300 types of items, including smart watches, bicycle helmets, play pens, high chairs and baby car seats. The changes come after fierce opposition from US companies including Apple and Dell, which fear the tariffs will increase their costs as many of their products are made in China. Earlier this month, Apple wrote to US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer warning that consumers would have to pay more for its products as a result of the proposed tariffs. At the time, Mr Trump replied with a tweet urging Apple: ""Make your products in the United States instead of China."" US tech firms ask for protection from next Trump tariffs This video can not be played Why the US-China trade war will hit most of our pockets The White House says its tariffs are a response to China's ""unfair"" trade policies. The import charges will make Chinese-made products more expensive - a move intended to convince US businesses and consumers to buy elsewhere. US officials hope the risk to the Chinese economy willconvince Beijing to change its policies. But many US businesses are critical of the tariffs with farmers, manufacturers, retailers and other industry groups calling them taxes on American families. Before its latest round of tariffs, China had previously imposed duties on $50bn of US products in retaliation, targeting key parts of the president's political base, such as farmers. The aim is to put pressure on businesses in states that supported Donald Trump in the 2016 US presidential election. The European Union has also used the tactic in its trade skirmishes with the US. Not really. Talks between high-level officials ended in May without resolving the matter and efforts to restart discussions have failed. US and China officials had discussed a new round of talks over the past week, but Mr Trump's latest move is likely to sour relations further. Andrew Walker, BBC economics correspondent The immediate objective of President Trump's action against China is to address what he calls the theft of American companies' technology, but it also plays into his wider concern about the US trade deficit. He sees it as something that needs to be corrected and as the result of bad trade agreements and unfair trading by other countries. The trouble is that a trade deficit is generally regarded as being the result of savings and investment decisions rather than trade policy. A country that spends more than it earns has a trade deficit. President Trump's other policies include tax cuts that could increase government borrowing, which is equivalent to cutting national saving and could create a bigger trade deficit. What Mr Trump hopes is that the tax cuts will boost economic activity so much that they will generate more revenue - and ""pay for themselves"". That's another area of economic controversy.

"A report says there should be no limit on the number of high-skilled workers, such as doctors, coming to the UK to work The cap on the number of high-skilled migrants coming to the UK should be scrapped, according toa key report commissioned by the government ahead of Brexit,external. The Migration Advisory Committee says these workers make a more positive contribution to the public finances. It suggests EU workers should be subject to the same visa rules as other migrants. But it notes the UK might offer them special status under a Brexit deal. The government has said it will ""carefully consider"" the committee's proposals. How has EU migration changed the UK? Labour backed the report, calling for an ""end to discrimination"" against non-EU migrants. Under the current system, workers from the European Economic Area (EEA) - which includes all EU countries including the UK, as well as Norway, Iceland and Lichtenstein - enjoy freedom of movement, travelling and working within the area without visas. The committee recommends a policy allowing greater access for higher-skilled migration while restricting access for lower-skilled workers. It suggests extending the current scheme for high-skilled non-EEA migrants - known as a Tier 2 visa - to those from EEA countries as well. As part of this process, the cap on the total amount of workers allowed to enter under Tier 2 should be abolished and the range of jobs eligeable for the visas expanded, the committee says. Current policy is to allow 20,700 high-skilled workers into the UK each year on Tier 2 visas. The current salary threshold for such visas is Â£30,000, which the report says should be retained. Top priority is given to jobs on a ""shortage occupation list,external"". Examples include: Geophysicists Mining engineers 3D computer animators Games designers Cyber security experts Emergency medicine consultants Paediatric consultants With regard to low-skilled workers, the committee says it is ""not convinced there needs to be a work route for low-skilled workers"" from the EU to fill jobs in industries such as catering or hospitality. The ""possible exception"" to this rule could be for seasonal agriculture, where 99% of the workers come from EU countries. Reality Check: Who are the low-skilled EU workers? It also does not recommend that there should be exceptions for workers coming to the UK to work in the public sector. The committee - which is made up of independent experts, says it does not seen any ""compelling reasons to offer a different set of rules"" for workers from the EEA than those from other countries - unless such a position has been arrived at as part of the Brexit negotiations. ""A migrant's impact depends on factors such as their skills, employment, age and use of public services, and not fundamentally on their nationality,"" it says. Do we really know how many people come to the UK? Taking stock of where we are with Brexit Brexit: All you need to know The report goes on to say there is no evidence that increased European migration has damaged life in the UK. It concludes that EU migrants pay more in tax than they receive in benefits, contribute more to the NHS workforce than the healthcare they access, and have no effect on crime rates. It says the impact of all EEA migration to the UK since 2004 was almost certainly less than that of the fall in the value of the pound following the referendum vote. By Dominic Casciani, BBC home affairs correspondent The report says there should be no route to ensure low-skilled workers can come in from the EU Ministers commissioned this report because they needed clear facts on the role of European workers in the country - and the implications of ending their freedom of movement. But it's too soon to know how many of the committee's recommendations will be adopted because of the Brexit elephant in the room. So while the experts want no special immigration deal for future EU workers (the report does not concern those who are already living in the UK), it doesn't consider whether a special deal would be good or bad for Britain. Such a deal is a possibility. The prime minister's Chequers plan proposes a ""mobility framework"" - a system allowing British and EU citizens to study and work in each other countries, potentially linked to a trade deal. So if the ministers offer special access for future EU workers, in return for something they want for the UK, this report won't help us know whether it is worth it. The MAC was asked to do the research in July 2017 by then Home Secretary Amber Rudd. It is thought it could shape the government's post-Brexit immigration policy. BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith said Mrs May might start ""sketching out"" her plans for this at October's Conservative Party conference. He added that the report would increase pressure on her to not compromise on freedom of movement during the Brexit negotiations. Please upgrade your browser Stephen Clarke, senior economic analyst at the Resolution Foundation, said if the recommendations were adopted, it would signal ""the biggest change to the UK labour market in a generation"" and would represent a ""huge shift"" for sectors such as hotels and food manufacturing. He said: ""If enacted, these proposals would effectively end low-skilled migration, while prioritising mid- and high-skill migration in areas where we have labour shortages. The Royal College of Nursing welcomed the recommendations, saying the UK had long depended on recruiting nursing professionals from around the world. But Lord Green of Deddington, chairman of Migration Watch UK, said the report was ""blind to the impact"" of EU migration to a number of communities. He said the proposals would ""permit continued high levels of immigration"" and ""the overall outcome would be to weaken immigration control"". The government says it will listen to the report and bring in an immigration system that works for the whole of the UK, adding: ""EU citizens play an important and positive role in our economy and society and we want that to continue after we leave"". Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said the UK's immigration policy should be ""based on our economic needs, while meeting our legal obligations and treating people fairly"". ""[This] means ending the discrimination against non-EU migrants, especially from the Commonwealth,"" she added. But Yvette Cooper, Labour MP and chair of the Home Affairs Select Committee, said the report was ""puzzling"" with ""significant gaps"" between the MAC's research and recommendations. ""The MAC admit they have ignored the crucial relationship between immigration and trade,"" she said. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Mylee Billingham died after being found stabbed at her father's home A man stabbed his ""trusting and defenceless"" eight-year-old daughter to death after threatening to kill her mother, a court has heard. Mylee Billingham died after being found with a knife wound to her chest at her father's home near Walsall in January. William Billingham, 55, was struggling to cope with his ex-partner's decision to start a relationship with another woman, Birmingham Crown Court was told. He denies murder and making a threat to kill. Midlands Live: Railway worker 'trapped in machinery'; Fire engulfs 1930s cinema Opening the case, prosecutor Karim Khalil QC said moments before Mylee was attacked on 20 January, Tracey Taundry had arrived to collect her daughter from Mr Billingham's house in Valley View, Brownhills. ""Whilst at the front door the defendant threatened to kill Tracey with the same knife and she had run off a short distance,"" he said. Mr Billingham met Miss Taundry when she was 19 and he was 40 and the relationship had initially caused tensions between her and his older children, the court heard. In 2010 she called police alleging he had struck her and thrown things around their flat, but she chose not pursue charges. Miss Taundry's bisexuality had often been a cause for light-hearted banter between her and Mr Billingham, the court heard. She met a woman who became her regular partner and the prosecutor said the fact this seemed to be getting more serious was something the defendant ""seemed to be struggling to deal with"". Mr Khalil told the jury: ""We say his actions were plainly hostile to this new situation."" Mr Billingham eventually moved out, with Miss Taundry describing them as initially remaining ""friends with benefits"". Mr Khalil said jury members were likely to have to consider Mr Billingham's mental state when Mylee was fatally injured at his house. ""The defendant did provide an account in interview of the time leading up to these terrible events, but he claimed to have no memory of the events themselves,"" he said. ""He has therefore provided little by way of explanation for what he did. ""Whether or not he can remember the events does not affect his responsibility for them."" The trial continues.

L/Cpl Edward Maher, 31, L/Cpl Craig Roberts, 24, and Cpl James Dunsby, 31, died after the trek during which they carried up to 27kg (4st) on their backs on one of the hottest days of 2013. A serving officer and former warrant officer, who faced court martial, denied negligence on the 16-mile march. The judge said they had no case to answer at Bulford Military Court. Following the case, one lawyer said the pair had been ""scapegoats for those at the top"" and criticised the fact that the Ministry of Defence (MoD) is immune from prosecution under health and safety legislation. Cpl Dunsby's widow Bryher Dunsby said the court martial ""revealed the shocking reality that there is still no official guidance for those conducting endurance training marches in the British Army on heat illness"" five years after the men died following the march in the Brecon Beacons. The savage beauty of the Brecon Beacons How dangerous is military training allowed to be? ""This is beyond unacceptable, and shows blatant ignorance to a vital need, where apparently three deaths are not enough to incite change,"" she said, speaking after the hearing. ""Nothing highlights this more than since the inquest in 2015 there have been yet further incidents from heat in training, even on Brecon."" Mrs Dunsby has called on the British Army's new chief of staff Mark Carleton-Smith to ""prioritise and put extra resources behind completing and implementing new guidelines for endurance marches and heat illness"". Cpl James Dunsby, L/Cpl Edward Maher and L/Cpl Craig Roberts died in July 2013 The Army said it had made a ""number of changes, particularly in relation to heat stress and training"". L/Cpl Roberts, from Conwy county, and L/Cpl Maher, from Winchester, were pronounced dead on the Welsh mountain range after suffering heatstroke on July 13, 2013. Cpl Dunsby, from Solihull in the West Midlands, died at Birmingham's Queen Elizabeth Hospital from multiple organ failure more than two weeks later. Identifiable only as 1A, a captain in command, and 1B, a warrant officer who has since left the Royal Marines, were the men were overseeing the selection exercise in the Brecon Beacons. Clare Stevens, who represented Cpl Dunsby's father at the inquest and L/Cpl Roberts' following the inquest, said the two put on trial were ""scapegoats for those at the top"". Beacons walker tells of SAS training soldier distress 96 soldiers questioned about mountain exercise ""The MoD is immune from prosecution under health and safety legislation... that is simply not good enough,"" she said. ""Until they are held properly accountable, there is no impetus to change."" Judge Jeff Blackett directed the five-person board at the court martial to acquit them. Following the deaths, a number of inquiries identified systemic failures but prosecutors alleged that the defendants had committed fundamental and basic errors. The march in the beacons took place on one of the hottest days of the year in July 2013 However, Judge Blackett found their lack of training on heat illness and risk assessments meant that other servicemen in their position would not have acted differently. ""I have determined that there is no evidence of negligent performance of duty when the conduct of these defendants is measured against the reasonable serviceman of similar experience, knowledge and training,"" he said. ""A board properly directed could not properly convict and I intend to stop the case now."" The two acquitted men said they ""did their duty diligently and conscientiously"" and have now been vindicated. ""This test was conducted to standards set by a higher authority that could not be changed by them,"" said a statement sent on their behalf. ""The judge has set out in great detail how the defendants did their best to provide a safe test system and even how they tried to stop the marches continuing on to the second day yet were overruled."" The soldiers collapsed during the march while carrying 50lbs (22kg) of equipment Louis Mably QC, prosecuting, said he would not appeal the judge's decision that the defendants had no case to answer. After the hearing, an Army spokesman said its thoughts ""remain with the families and friends"" of the men. ""The safety and wellbeing of our personnel remains our top priority and following these tragic events we have made a number of changes, particularly in relation to heat stress and training, to ensure an incident like this does not happen again,"" he said.

"The Mini factory in Oxford will shut down for a month after Brexit at the end of March to minimise disruption in case of a no-deal outcome. Owner BMW said its summer maintenance shutdown had been brought forward to 1 April to reduce any ""possible short-term parts-supply disruption"". ""While we believe this worst case scenario is an unlikely outcome, we have to plan for it,"" BMW said. The German firm said it ""remained committed"" to its UK operations. The Cowley plant, on the outskirts of Oxford, will remain open in April with maintenance, management and catering staff continuing to work despite no cars being made. It employs 4,500 people and produces 5,000 cars a week. BMW said the downtime would be used to start preparing the plant to make the new electric Mini. The concern is that in the event of the UK leaving the EU without a deal on 29 March, there could be disruption at the borders and shortages of parts. Hundreds of lorries a day arrive at Cowley with parts from across the world, with 60% of components coming from the EU. Theo Leggett, BBC business correspondent Factory shutdowns are common in the car industry. Machinery needs to be repaired or replaced and updates or modifications to production lines carried out. Usually at Mini this happens during the summer and is built into the carmaker's output planning. What BMW has done is simply reschedule that shutdown to coincide with a potential period of serious disruption at the borders after Brexit, if we leave the EU without a deal. If the plant is not actually making cars, then a shortage of imported parts should not be so much of a problem. The company says a no-deal outcome is unlikely, but has to be planned for. Rescheduling the annual shutdown looks like a relatively simple and inexpensive piece of contingency planning. Nevertheless, it does send out a political message. It's a reminder that carmakers are particularly reliant on frictionless borders, to ensure parts arrive where they're needed at exactly the right time. And it shows that BMW is taking the risk of a no-deal Brexit seriously. Add that to comments made by the Jaguar Land Rover boss last week suggesting that the wrong Brexit deal could cost tens of thousands of jobs, and it suggests that people within the industry are getting rather nervous right now. This video can not be played How British is a Mini? Other carmakers with British operations have warned that a bad or no Brexit deal would be damaging for the UK car industry. Earlier on Tuesday, the head of Honda Europe, Ian Howells,told the BBC that a no-deal Brexit would cost his company tens of millions of pounds. ""In terms of administration, we'd probably be looking at something like sixty odd thousand additional bits of documentation we would have to provide to get product to and from Europe,"" Mr Howells told BBC Radio 5 live. ""And clearly if we end up with World Trade Organization tariffs we'd have something like 10% costs in addition on our shipped product back into Europe, and that would certainly run into tens of millions of pounds."" Last week, Jaguar Land Rover boss Ralf Speth warned the government to get ""the right Brexit"" orit could wipe out profits at the carmaker and lead to big job cuts. On Tuesday the company said about 1,000 workers at its Castle Bromwich plant in Birmingham wouldmove from a five-day to a three-day weekfrom October until Christmas. JLR - the UK's largest carmaker - said it was making ""temporary adjustments"" to its production schedules at the factory, which produces Jaguar cars. How British is a Mini?

"The Il-20 aircraft was returning to a Russian base on the north-western coast of Syria (file photo) The leaders of Russia and Israel have sought to defuse tension after a Russian plane was shot down by Syrian forces amid an Israeli air raid. In a call to Vladimir Putin, Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu expressed regret at the loss of 15 Russian personnel, but stressed again that Syria was to blame. Mr Putin had earlier called the incident ""a chain of tragic accidental circumstances"". The Il-20 plane was downed over the Mediterranean Sea on Monday evening. What will be the fallout of the Russian deaths? A tour of Syria - with the Russian military Russia is supporting President Bashar al-Assad in Syria's civil war. Mr Putin and Mr Netanyahu spoke by telephone on Monday, shortly after the Russian president had made his conciliatory statement in Moscow. Mr Putin said at a media briefing: ""It looks most likely in this case that it was a chain of tragic chance events, because an Israeli aircraft did not shoot down our aircraft. But, without any doubt we need to seriously get the bottom of what happened."" Mr Netanyahu addressed that issue in the telephone call, offering to provide ""all necessary information"" in the investigation of the incident, as well as expressing regret over the fatalities. In the call, Mr Putin urged Mr Netanyahu ""not to let such a situation happen in the future"" and told him Israeli air operations breached Syrian sovereignty, Russian media said. Russia's Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu had earlier said that Moscow ""reservesÂ the right to take further steps in response"". But Mr Putin said the ""retaliatory measures"" would be ""aimed first and foremost at further ensuring the safety of our military personnel"". The BBC's defence and diplomatic correspondent, Jonathan Marcus, says the crisis will almost certainly blow over as Israel and Russia have a remarkably close relationship and Moscow has until now not interfered with Israeli operations. Russia's Tass news agency said an Ilyushin Il-20 reconnaissance plane had ""disappeared during an attack by four Israeli F-16 jets on Syrian facilities in Latakia province"". Photos 'reveal' Russia jet damage at Hmeimim base Why is there a war in Syria? The downing was reported to have occurred about 35km (22 miles) from the Syrian coast as the Il-20 aircraft was returning to Russia's Hmeimim airbase near Latakia. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said its aircraft were targeting Syrian military facilities ""from which systems to manufacture accurate and lethal weapons were about to be transferred on behalf of Iran to Hezbollah in Lebanon"". The Lebanese Shia militant group and Iran are both allies of the Syrian government. Israel has reportedly hit more than 200 Iranian targets in Syria over the past 18 months. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group said some Israeli missiles did find the target and two people were killed on the ground. However, it could not confirm their identity and Syria has made no official comment. Both the Russians and Israelis agree it was Syrian anti-aircraft fire, although Syria has not commented. Russia said it was given less than a minute's warning by Israel ahead of the strikes, which was not enough time to get the military surveillance plane out of the way. It also said the Israeli planes had ""used the Russian airplane as a cover"", putting it ""in the line of fire coming from Syrian air defence systems"". Israel disputes this.In a rare statement detailing its operations over Syria,external, the IDF said: ""The Russian plane that was hit was not within the area of the operation... when the Syrian army launched the missiles that hit the Russian plane, (Israeli) jets were already within Israeli airspace."" The Russian defence ministry said body fragments, personal belongings and the plane's debris had been found by search ships in the Mediterranean on Tuesday. Israel was adamant. The IDF said: ""Israel holds the Assad regime, whose military shot down the Russian plane, fully responsible for this incident."" The statement also laid blame on Iran and Hezbollah. In his phone call with Mr Putin, Mr Netanyahu insisted that Israel would continue to target Iran inside Syria. Russia and Turkey to create Syria buffer zone In an initial statement, Russia said: ""The Israeli planes deliberately created a dangerous situation for surface ships and aircraft in the area. ""As a result of the irresponsible actions by the Israeli military, 15 Russian servicemen have died."" Analysis by Jonathan Marcus, BBC Defence Correspondent Russia is clearly angry. It has lost an aircraft and the lives of its 15-person crew. It needs to register its displeasure but is also reluctant to condemn its regional ally Syria. Israel and Russia have a remarkably close relationship and a clear understanding about Israel Defense Forces (IDF) operations in the region. So might this episode change this? I think that is doubtful. For one thing the air campaign in Syria is seen by Israel as a vital strategic necessity to thwart, as they see it, Iran's growing influence. And for Russia to try to physically interfere with Israeli operations would go entirely against the policy pursued by Moscow up till now. Read more from Jonathan Russia began military strikes in Syria in 2015 after a request from President Assad, who has stayed in power despite seven years of civil war which has so far killed more than 350,000 people. Hmeimim is Russia's main base for air strikes on rebel groups in Syria - strikes that have enabled President Assad's forces to recover much lost ground since 2015. Russia says its air strikes only target ""terrorists"", but activists have said they mainly hit mainstream rebel fighters and civilians. According to The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group, at least 7,928 civilians and 10,069 combatants have been killed in Russian strikes. Russia has also suffered personnel losses, including the deaths of 39 people whena Russian military transport plane crashed as it attempted to landat Hmeimim in March.

"A photograph of a boy weeping next to his father's body moved Indian social media users to raise more than three million rupees ($43,829; Â£33,350) for his family in a day. The picture was shared on Twitter more than 7,000 times. Anil, 37, was a sewer worker in the capital Delhi, who died when the rope lowering him into a sewer snapped, causing him to fall inside. By some estimates, about 100 sewer workers die in India every year. Unions have alleged that this is because they are not given proper safety equipment. Shiv Sunny, a reporter at The Hindustan Times, who tweeted the picture on Monday, told the BBC that he was ""shaken"" by the sight of the man's grieving son, who is 11. Allow Twitter content?

He added that while even Bollywood actors reached out to him to ask how they could help Anil's family, what was really moving was that poorer people had donated sums of money as small as 10 rupees. The numerous questions and comments about the family on social media prompted him to go back and find out more about them. Mr Sunny also spoke to the grieving son, who told him that he would sometimes accompany his father to work and ""wait outside guarding his clothes and shoes from thieves"". ""My father would say it still wasn't yet time for me to enter the sewers,"" Mr Sunny quoted the boy as saying in the Hindustan Times. Police told the NDTV news website that an investigation into Anil's death had revealed thatthe rope was not strong enough and that Anil had not been wearing protective gear,external.

"This video can not be played Drew Povey was in the TV series Educating Greater Manchester The head teacher of the school which featured in the TV series Educating Greater Manchester has resigned after claiming his suspension felt like a ""personal vendetta"". Drew Povey, head at Harrop Fold School in Little Hulton, Salford, was suspendedin July. The BBC understands the suspension relates to school record-keeping. Salford City Council denied the allegation that it was a personal vendetta against Mr Povey. Three other members of staff were suspended as part of the investigation. In a tweet,external, Mr Povey said he could no longer sit quietly under the ""threat"" of not being able to comment. He said he understood his suspension related to administrative errors involving a ""very small number of pupils"" about how attendance, exclusions and home schooling were recorded. Mr Povey said he took full responsibility for the errors, but did not believe they ""constitute grounds for me to be pursued in the way that I have been"". ""This feels very much like a personal vendetta and I hope that by removing myself from the situation, that some semblance of normality will return to the school, for the benefit of all,"" he said. He said the ""protracted"" investigation had created uncertainty and had had a ""detrimental impact"" on the school. Lisa Stone, the council's lead member for children's and young people's services, said she was disappointed that Mr Povey had made some details of the investigation public. ""In my experience governors do not launch investigations and suspend senior members of staff for mere administrative errors,"" she said. ""This is an in-depth and wide-ranging investigation into many serious allegations and it will continue in the interests of the school, pupils, parents and the members of staff who remain suspended.

"A report says there should be no limit on the number of high-skilled workers, such as doctors, coming to the UK to work The cap on the number of high-skilled migrants coming to the UK should be scrapped, according toa key report commissioned by the government ahead of Brexit,external. The Migration Advisory Committee says these workers make a more positive contribution to the public finances. It suggests EU workers should be subject to the same visa rules as other migrants. But it notes the UK might offer them special status under a Brexit deal. The government has said it will ""carefully consider"" the committee's proposals. How has EU migration changed the UK? Labour backed the report, calling for an ""end to discrimination"" against non-EU migrants. Under the current system, workers from the European Economic Area (EEA) - which includes all EU countries including the UK, as well as Norway, Iceland and Lichtenstein - enjoy freedom of movement, travelling and working within the area without visas. The committee recommends a policy allowing greater access for higher-skilled migration while restricting access for lower-skilled workers. It suggests extending the current scheme for high-skilled non-EEA migrants - known as a Tier 2 visa - to those from EEA countries as well. As part of this process, the cap on the total amount of workers allowed to enter under Tier 2 should be abolished and the range of jobs eligeable for the visas expanded, the committee says. Current policy is to allow 20,700 high-skilled workers into the UK each year on Tier 2 visas. The current salary threshold for such visas is Â£30,000, which the report says should be retained. Top priority is given to jobs on a ""shortage occupation list,external"". Examples include: Geophysicists Mining engineers 3D computer animators Games designers Cyber security experts Emergency medicine consultants Paediatric consultants With regard to low-skilled workers, the committee says it is ""not convinced there needs to be a work route for low-skilled workers"" from the EU to fill jobs in industries such as catering or hospitality. The ""possible exception"" to this rule could be for seasonal agriculture, where 99% of the workers come from EU countries. Reality Check: Who are the low-skilled EU workers? It also does not recommend that there should be exceptions for workers coming to the UK to work in the public sector. The committee - which is made up of independent experts, says it does not seen any ""compelling reasons to offer a different set of rules"" for workers from the EEA than those from other countries - unless such a position has been arrived at as part of the Brexit negotiations. ""A migrant's impact depends on factors such as their skills, employment, age and use of public services, and not fundamentally on their nationality,"" it says. Do we really know how many people come to the UK? Taking stock of where we are with Brexit Brexit: All you need to know The report goes on to say there is no evidence that increased European migration has damaged life in the UK. It concludes that EU migrants pay more in tax than they receive in benefits, contribute more to the NHS workforce than the healthcare they access, and have no effect on crime rates. It says the impact of all EEA migration to the UK since 2004 was almost certainly less than that of the fall in the value of the pound following the referendum vote. By Dominic Casciani, BBC home affairs correspondent The report says there should be no route to ensure low-skilled workers can come in from the EU Ministers commissioned this report because they needed clear facts on the role of European workers in the country - and the implications of ending their freedom of movement. But it's too soon to know how many of the committee's recommendations will be adopted because of the Brexit elephant in the room. So while the experts want no special immigration deal for future EU workers (the report does not concern those who are already living in the UK), it doesn't consider whether a special deal would be good or bad for Britain. Such a deal is a possibility. The prime minister's Chequers plan proposes a ""mobility framework"" - a system allowing British and EU citizens to study and work in each other countries, potentially linked to a trade deal. So if the ministers offer special access for future EU workers, in return for something they want for the UK, this report won't help us know whether it is worth it. The MAC was asked to do the research in July 2017 by then Home Secretary Amber Rudd. It is thought it could shape the government's post-Brexit immigration policy. BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith said Mrs May might start ""sketching out"" her plans for this at October's Conservative Party conference. He added that the report would increase pressure on her to not compromise on freedom of movement during the Brexit negotiations. Please upgrade your browser Stephen Clarke, senior economic analyst at the Resolution Foundation, said if the recommendations were adopted, it would signal ""the biggest change to the UK labour market in a generation"" and would represent a ""huge shift"" for sectors such as hotels and food manufacturing. He said: ""If enacted, these proposals would effectively end low-skilled migration, while prioritising mid- and high-skill migration in areas where we have labour shortages. The Royal College of Nursing welcomed the recommendations, saying the UK had long depended on recruiting nursing professionals from around the world. But Lord Green of Deddington, chairman of Migration Watch UK, said the report was ""blind to the impact"" of EU migration to a number of communities. He said the proposals would ""permit continued high levels of immigration"" and ""the overall outcome would be to weaken immigration control"". The government says it will listen to the report and bring in an immigration system that works for the whole of the UK, adding: ""EU citizens play an important and positive role in our economy and society and we want that to continue after we leave"". Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said the UK's immigration policy should be ""based on our economic needs, while meeting our legal obligations and treating people fairly"". ""[This] means ending the discrimination against non-EU migrants, especially from the Commonwealth,"" she added. But Yvette Cooper, Labour MP and chair of the Home Affairs Select Committee, said the report was ""puzzling"" with ""significant gaps"" between the MAC's research and recommendations.

"This video can not be played Theresa May on what can be achieved at Salzburg summit Theresa May has said the EU must ""evolve"" its stance on the Irish border as she seeks to persuade fellow leaders about the viability of her Brexit plan. The PM is using a dinner in Salzburg to make the case for her controversial Chequers strategy for future relations. Before the event, she said it was the only credible plan to allay concerns on the Irish border and trade disruption. Austrian chancellor Sebastian Kurz, who is hosting the event, said both sides needed to make compromises. 'Multiple chances' for new Brexit vote It's my Brexit deal or no deal, May says Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop The UK and EU both want to avoid a hard border - meaning any physical infrastructure like cameras or guard posts - between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland but can't agree on how. Mrs May has previously rejected the EU's ""backstop"" plan - which involves keeping Northern Ireland aligned with its trading rules - saying it would divide up the UK. Ahead of the Salzburg summit, the EU's negotiator Michel Barnier said most checks could take place away from border areas, an apparent concession to the UK. Addressing reporters as she arrived for dinner in the Austrian city, Mrs May welcomed what she said was the EU's recognition its initial proposal were ""unacceptable"". ""If we're going to achieve a successful conclusion then, just as the UK has evolved its position, the EU will need to evolve its position too,"" she said. This video can not be played BBC News NI's political reporter Jayne McCormack explains why the border is an issue After Brexit, the 310 mile border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland will become the UK's border with the EU. At the moment, thousands of people cross it every day for both work and pleasure - as do goods, like food and medicines, being delivered across the two countries. As part of the EU single market and customs union, these products do not need to be checked for customs and standards, but when the UK leaves these two arrangements, this all changes. Nobody wants a hard border for the checks - in fact the 1998 Good Friday agreement, which helped bring peace to Northern Ireland, got rid of security checks as part of the deal, and police in Northern Ireland have warned reinstating them could make crossings targets for violence. But there is no agreement between the UK and EU, or between Leavers and Remainers, about the answer. The border between the two countries has hundreds of crossing points Privately, EU officials say those checks could be carried out by British or EU officials, or by health inspectors rather than customs officials, to ""de-dramatise"" the border issue. Mrs May has insisted there needs to be ""friction-free movement of goods"", with no customs or regulatory checks, between Northern Ireland and the Republic, in order to avoid a hard border there. There are just over six months to go before the UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. Negotiations are at a critical stage, with both sides hoping for an agreement on the terms of the UK's withdrawal and future trade relations by the start of November at the latest. Please upgrade your browser Speaking on Tuesday, Mr Barnier said the talks were in the ""home straight"" but there were still significant areas of disagreement - such as on the role of the European Court of Justice in enforcing the withdrawal agreement and intellectual property issues, including geographical protections for food and drink. ""October is the key point in time - it is the moment of truth,"" he added. The EU is still insisting on its own ""legally operationally backstop"" - what it describes as an insurance policy to prevent the return of physical infrastructure on the border in the event no other solution can be found. Will summit mark a Brexit turning point? Brexit: All you need to know At-a-glance: The UK's four Brexit options Brussels put forward a proposal in February that would see Northern Ireland stay aligned with the EU in key areas, effectively staying in the customs union and single market and not needing those border checks. But the UK insisted this was unacceptable as it would split Northern Ireland off from the rest of the UK. On Tuesday Mr Barnier said the backstop should focus on a ""set of technical checks and controls"" to make sure standards are met and customs are paid, and not be about a sea or land border.

""We are ready to improve this proposal,"" he said. ""Work on the EU side is ongoing. We are clarifying which goods arriving in Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK would need to be checked and where, when and by whom these checks could be performed. ""We can also clarify that most checks can take place away from the border at a company premises or at the markets."" BBC Northern Ireland business editor John Campbell said that the fact the EU was prepared to ""improve"" the language of the backstop was not news as it hadbeen talked about before,external- so ""we need to wait and see what any improvements might amount to"". Speaking in Salzburg, Mr Tusk confirmed a special EU summit dedicated to Brexit would take place in mid-November. He welcomed some elements of the Chequers proposals - on security and policing - but said that on the Irish border and economic cooperation they will need to be ""reworked and further negotiated"". It has been reported Mrs May will have ten minutes to update her 27 counterparts At the dinner in Salzburg, Mrs May is expected to appeal for ""goodwill and determination"" from the EU, while stressing that ""no other country"" could accept the EU's backstop plan if they were in the same situation. The UK put forward rival backstop proposals in June, which would see the whole of the UK staying in a customs union with the EU after the end of the proposed Brexit transition period in December 2020. It also says its Chequers blueprint for a future trading relationship - involving a ""common rulebook"" for goods and treating the UK and the EU as a ""combined customs territory"" - would solve the border question. Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab said the EU had to move closer to the UK's position or it would be a ""lose-lose"" for both sides. ""Chequers may not be perfect, but it's the most credible plan,"" he told LBC Radio. ""I think there is an understanding that we're approaching the endpoint of these negotiations, and there will need to be some movement on the EU side."" In an interview with theDaily Express,external, Mrs May said that going back on the 2016 vote to leave the EU would ""destroy trust in politicians"". MPs had decided to give people a vote on EU membership by a large margin, she said: ""People weren't saying it's the choice of the public except if we disagree with the answer we'll ask them again."" The People's Vote campaign wants the final terms of Brexit to be put to a referendum with the option of staying in the EU if it is rejected. ""My answer to the People's Vote is that we've had the people's vote - it was the referendum - and now we should deliver on it,"" the prime minister said. On Tuesday People's Vote set out ways they said a new referendum could be achieved through votes in Parliament.

"Estimates suggest 630,000 immigrated to the UK last year, but how accurate is that number? Latest figures show that net migration from the European Union is at itslowest level since 2012- but how are the numbers gathered, and how reliable are they? The system the UK used to use to estimate long-term migration was, in the words of the Office for National Statistics, ""stretched beyond its purpose"". The system's critics have been a little harsher. They say it offers at best an educated guess - and at worst is deeply flawed. Every three months the Office for National Statistics (ONS) publishes a migration update. And at the heart of that report is theInternational Passenger Survey,external(IPS). This enormous exercise was launched in 1961 to help the government better understand the impact of travel and tourism on the economy - but over the years, it became a rather useful way of estimating who was coming and going for broader political purposes. When the David Cameron government set a net migration target of tens of thousands in 2010, the IPS projection became a very public measure of policy failure. So how does the IPS come up with its figures, and why is it so controversial? For 362 days a year, IPS staff leap in front of travellers at 19 airports, eight ports and the Channel Tunnel rail link. They ask them for a bit of their life story: where they're from, why they're in the UK and how long they might be staying. 10 charts explaining the UK's immigration system Call to review 'tens of thousands' immigration target Migration from EU to UK lowest for four years, ONS figures show Up to 800,000 people a year take part and about 250,000 of those results are put through the statistical mixer to come up with an estimate for the number of people either arriving to live in the UK, or leaving the UK for at least a year - the internationally-agreed definition of a long-term migrant. But the IPS doesn't cover all the ports, all of the time. Take Dover, for example. There are up to 51 ferry arrivals a day - and the IPS only covers four days' worth of them over an entire year. The nationwide sample works out at just over 1% of Heathrow's annual traffic of 78 million people. Within the sample, the number of known migrants is about 5,000. So they are an incredibly small group, within an already small sample, upon which statisticians are expected to give ministers some big answers. The ONS publishes figures that, in layman's terms, show how confident it is in the estimates. Here's how it works. Last July the ONS estimated net migration to be 282,000 a year. But there is a large margin of error. The figure could be wrong by 47,000 either way. So net migration could be as low as 235,000 or as high as 329,000. That is the statistical problem with surveys the world over. And two parliamentary committees in just over a year have concluded that the IPS is now next to useless, on its own, for what ministers need it to do. In 2015, a gap between the number of international students arriving and leaving prompted accusations that a lot of students were illegally over-staying their visas. ""The fact is too many [students] are not returning home as soon as their visas run out,"" Theresa May told that year's Conservative Party conference. ""I don't care what the university lobbyists say. The rules must be enforced. Students, yes; overstayers, no."" It turned out there was no mass over-staying. The first ever experimental deep dive into departure gate data (more on that in a moment) revealed 97% of students went home on time. The gap was all down to the limitations in the IPS. Last year theLords' Economic Affairs Committee,externalwas more scathing still, saying the statistics were so poor that ministries were ""formulating policy in the dark"". Earlier this year, theONS says,,externalit began to use other data sources in its migration estimates. These new sources include Home Office administrative data and National Insurance numbers. ""Taken together"", the ONS says, these ""provide a better indication of trends that any single source alone"". National Insurance numbers can be used to count foreign nationals -  but having a number doesn't prove someone is in the country. People don't cancel them when they leave. Then there is Home Office entry clearance data - the official data from visa applications. That's helpful for most of the world - but it doesn't count EU nationals or British nationals who have been living overseas. The Labour Force Survey (LFS) captures the nationality of people working in the UK. But it doesn't capture people in communal accommodation and doesn't cover short-term migration. And there have been claims that the LFS has been undercounting migrants in specific sectors, such as hospitality. Visa data can be used to measure migration, but not for EU citizens who have visa-free access to the UK What about the UK census? It's the most definite physical count of people we have - so reliable in fact, that the 2011 exercise added almost 350,000 to the net migration estimates for the previous decade. But it's a mammoth undertaking, costing close to Â£500m. And given it only happens once a decade, it's not going to tell you much in an age of mass and rapid migration. A lot of the UK's peers are more advanced in how they come up with migrant counts. New Zealand makes travellers fill in entry and exit cards - including their own nationals - which gives a precise measure of who's where. You can't get in or out of the country until you fill in the card. The UK had a similar system until it was scrapped in the 1990s. Many countries have population registers. Italy, for example, requires migrants to register with their local authority. The big problem with a register? People forget to remove themselves from the list if they move on. Passenger survey:interviewing people at borders, but sample sizes can produce large confidence intervals. Used in the UK and Malta. Visas: the number of people applying for visas to a country, but this does not count those with visa-free travel, such as citizens of the EU. Used in New Zealand, Australia, Canada. Register:making all new migrants to an area register with a municipal hall. But some people don't do it or simply forget to say when they move on. Used in most EU countries. Census: almost all countries do this, but it is expensive, so done at long intervals. The Danes and the Swedes try to resolve that by matching registers with other official sources - and it's this use of ""administration data"" which is now seen as the holy grail of understanding migration. The UK's long, long delayed electronic replacement for exit and entry checks is now operational - although the immigration watchdog recently found the Home Office guilty of ""wishful thinking"" in suggesting it was delivering all it was claimed to do. The prize for statisticians is to take this kind of data and mash it up with new sources, such as those already being used in Denmark and Sweden. And that's now the official plan in the UK. Denmark and Sweden are both seen as countries with better ways to capture migration In the autumn, the Office for National Statistics will publish its first thoughts on how a new far more reliable count of migrants could work. In an ideal world, it would link the movement of real people to tax records and information about their whereabouts from other sources, such as registrations with schools and GP surgeries. Such an approach could give us accurate information on both short-term and ""circular"" migration - people who come and go a number of times. If this system could be made to work, the International Passenger Survey would no longer be the primary source upon which so much policy - and political hot air - is based. We would finally have some accurate numbers which could properly capture migration to and from Britain - information which will be critical if control of immigration remains vitally important to voters after Brexit. Correction: This piece has been amended to reflect recent changes in how the ONS uses other data to draw up migration estimates.

"A key part of the Brexit negotiations has been the border that separates Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The border is a matter of great political, security and diplomatic sensitivity in Ireland. Therefore the UK and EU agreed that whatever happens as a result of Brexit there should be no new physical checks or infrastructure at the frontier. This is where the controversial ""backstop"" comes in. At present, goods and services are traded between the two jurisdictions with few restrictions. That is because the UK and Ireland are part of the EU's single market and customs union, so products do not need to be inspected for customs or standards. But after Brexit, all that could change - the two parts of Ireland could be in different customs and regulatory regimes, which could mean products being checked at the border. The preference of both sides is to prevent this happening through a deep and comprehensive trade deal. However, the UK's ambition to leave the customs union and the single market, could make that very difficult. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. And if both sides couldn't reach agreement on a deal keeping the border as open as it is now - that's where the backstop would come in. So how might it it work? There are several options: This is what the EU originally proposed. It would involve Northern Ireland alone remaining in the EU's single market and customs union, leaving Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) free to strike trade deals. But the DUP - a Northern Ireland unionist party that propped up Theresa May's minority Conservative government - objected to this. It said it would see Northern Ireland treated differently and could threaten the union. Boris Johnson has alsospecifically ruled this out. After the DUP's objections, Mrs May agreed a backstop involving the whole of the UK retaining a very close relationship with the EU - staying in the customs union - for an indefinite period. It would also see Northern Ireland staying even more closely tied to some rules of the EU single market. These arrangements would apply unless and until both the EU and UK agree they are no longer necessary. This video can not be played Would you notice if you crossed the Irish border? (Video from 2017) The backstop would not apply if the UK left the EU without a deal but the potential problems with the border would remain. The backstop plan was agreed by UK-EU negotiators and formed part of Theresa May's withdrawal agreement in November 2018 (often referred to as the Brexit ""divorce deal""). It sparked a backlash from many Conservative MPs (and the DUP) at Westminster and several of her own ministers resigned in protest. Please upgrade your browser They feared that the backstop would be used to permanently trap the UK in the EU customs union, preventing the country from striking its own trade deals. Ultimately, her deal was voted down three times, leading to her resignation. Prime Minister Boris Johnson says he is committed to ""getting rid"" of the backstop, describing it as ""anti-democratic"". His government has instead proposed the idea of a ""single regulatory zone"" on the island of Ireland. That would mean Northern Ireland continuing to follow EU rules on animal health, food safety and manufactured goods. It would effectively mean a new regulatory border in the Irish Sea with checks and controls at ports. The DUP say they can accept this as long as there is a role for the Northern Ireland Assembly to give ongoing consent to these arrangements. On customs, the UK has said Northern Ireland must leave the EU customs union. However the Prime Minister believes checks at the Irish frontier can be avoided by instead having customs processes mainly at company premises. The EU is sceptical about this and the latest negotiations have focused largely on customs. Many Brexit supporters say what are known as ""alternative arrangements"" could be used to avoid checks at the border. The phrase is normally used to refer to technical or technological solutions. These include things like trusted traders schemes and using GPS to track lorries. The EU has committed to working on alternative arrangements but has said no systems which could solve the border problem are currently ""operational"".

"Welcome to Salzburg: Theresa May will be buoyed by the Austrian chancellor's call to avoid a hard Brexit Hype is part and parcel when it comes to EU summits during the Brexit process. How many times have we heard that an upcoming meeting of EU leaders is either a deadline, a turning point or even a last chance in negotiations? Except that invariably this turns out not to be the case and Brexit cans are kicked, once again, down the twist-and-turn path of EU-UK talks. Theresa May fervently hopes so. The informal summit in Salzburg this week is the first time that EU leaders have sat together since she presented them with her by-now-infamous Chequers Brexit proposal. The prime minister and a couple of key ministers invested a lot of time this summer touring European capitals in an attempt to persuade EU leaders to turn their back on what London regards as the overly officious, rules and regulations-obsessed European Commission. Instead they want them to embrace her more ""creative"" plan for the EU-UK post-Brexit relationship. The prime minister believes that time is on her side. Not much room left any more for kicking Brexit cans down the road in Brussels. The time allowed under EU law for negotiations is fast running out. And Theresa May knows EU leaders want a Brexit deal this autumn. Taking stock of where we are with Brexit Brexit: All you need to know Chequers plan 'will avoid hard border' She will have felt further buoyed this weekend, when, following a meeting between Germany's Angela Merkel and Austria's Sebastian Kurz, the Austrian prime minister commented that everything possible must now be done to prevent a no-deal Brexit. Short answer: not really, however much wishful thinking may have been or may still be going on in Downing Street. Yes, EU leaders see the political turmoil in the UK over Brexit. They see Theresa May in trouble and they want to throw her as much of a lifeline as they can - because, as I say above, they really, really, really want a Brexit deal this autumn. More from Katya:EU banks on last-minute Brexit deal As we heard with Sebastian Kurz, EU words are becoming warmer, more encouraging and even softening in tone, but just to be clear, this is more atmospherics than a sea change in the EU's negotiating stance. EU leaders do not appear willing to compromise what they see as key EU principles to get a Brexit deal done. Take Emmanuel Macron, for example, and don't forget: France and Germany still lead in the EU on issues as big as this. Over and over again the French president emphasises that France and the EU as a whole want to keep a deep and close relationship with the UK after Brexit - but, he always insists, this cannot come at the price of compromising the EU itself. While the French president wants a deep relationship with the UK, it will not come at the expense of the EU ""France wants to maintain a strong, special relationship with London but not if the cost is the European Union's unravelling,"" is what he told a gathering of French ambassadors a couple of weeks ago. Despite progress in Brexit negotiations, which will be discussed in Salzburg, Theresa May still insists on her red lines, as she did once again in her BBC interview aired on Monday. No more big payments into the EU budget, no more freedom of movement of EU workers to come to the UK, no more European Court of Justice supremacy over UK laws, no more European single market, etc. But the EU is also refusing to stray from its ""no cherry-picking"" mantra. This video can not be played Theresa May says she believes the alternative to her negotiations ""will be not having a deal"" You're in or you're out, says Brussels; there'll be no partial membership of the single market for the UK after Brexit. EU leaders are also not softening on the key sticking-point in finalising the UK's exit agreement from their club: the Irish border. Brussels isn't backing down from its insistence on a fall-back clause, ensuring that, whatever the post-Brexit relationship between the UK and EU looks like in the end, there will be no hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Comments at the weekend by key Brexiteer and Environment Secretary Michael Gove only serve to make the EU more resolute in getting this Irish border commitment legally binding. Mr Gove said that whatever relationship the UK prime minister might sign up to with the EU now, that could be altered in the future. All that said, don't rush to dismiss Salzburg altogether. The tone and mood there will be important. Theresa May will address EU leaders at dinner on Wednesday night. They are not allowed to negotiate with her - the European Commission has the sole negotiating role for the EU - but it's a valuable opportunity to tell European peers what she needs from them to secure a deal; not only in Brussels, but considering all the political complications in Westminster, at home too. After the prime minister leaves Salzburg on Thursday, the 27 EU leaders will discuss Brexit amongst themselves. May 'irritated' by leadership speculation Reality Check: The UK's Brexit preparations Their chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, will kick off proceedings with an update on negotiations so far. Each EU leader is then expected to give their thoughts on the Irish border, as well as the current deadlock between the UK and EU and possibly ways to break it. This is key. Michel Barnier (C) has sought to ""de-dramatise"" the Irish border issue Downing Street rejects the European Commission's Irish border backstop proposal, which would keep Northern Ireland in the European customs union and parts of the single market. The government says that would break up the constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom. The Commission has been working since the summer on changing the language of its backstop to ""de-dramatise"" it and to show, says Brussels, that its proposal is practical - involving minimal customs checks - and not political at all. The Commission also proposes heavy emphasis on the fact that the backstop is the worst-case scenario, fallback position that neither the EU nor the UK ever want to use. Please upgrade your browser EU sources tell me that could be written prominently in the political declaration on the UK-EU post-Brexit relationship which will accompany the UK's exit agreement as part of the aimed-for autumn deal. Leaders will discuss that non-legally-binding political declaration in Salzburg - how detailed it should or should not be on Ireland, on customs, security and much more. Still, as an informal summit, no formal written conclusions will be published in Salzburg. Brexit-process cynics may groan to hear they'll have to wait till the next EU leaders' summit in October for meat on all those bones. Unlike Salzburg, the October meeting in Brussels is a formal summit and - unlike Salzburg - it comes after the Conservative Party Conference. So, in theory, both the EU and Theresa May are expected to be in a position to reach some big decisions.

"With the UK on course to leave the European Union in March next year, the country faces four possible scenarios. The UK and the EU both insist they want as amicable a divorce as possible, with a legal agreement setting out the kind of relationship they will have when the UK is no longer a member of the club. MP quits as minister over Brexit vote Reality Check: What does the Brexit White Paper reveal? Brexit: All you need to know Prime Minister Theresa May wants to keep close ties with the EU in certain areas, such as trade in agricultural products and allowing skilled migrants access to jobs in the UK. She saysher plan,externalwill allow Britain to take back control of its laws, money and borders, just like people voted for in the 2016 EU referendum, while also allowing as ""frictionless"" trade as possible and avoiding a physical border for Northern Ireland. But it has been attacked as an unworkable compromise by people from both the Remain and Leave ends of the debate. The EU may also decide to reject it, but the two sides are still hoping to strike some kind of deal by the autumn and, despite criticism and ministerial resignations, Mrs May believes this is the best option. A clean break with the EU. The UK would fall back on its membership of the World Trade Organization (WTO), the global body governing international trade. UK exports to the EU would be subject to the same customs checks and taxes the EU currently imposes on countries like the United States. Those arguing for this option - the so-called ""hard Brexiteers"" - say it would create a truly independent nation able to strike its own beneficial trade deals around the world. But opponents say it would be catastrophic for British business and have warned about chaos at the borders, higher food prices and shortages in the shops. The UK has formally triggered the mechanism to leave the EU at 23:00 GMT on 29 March, 2019. To reverse that at this late stage would mean a huge loss of political face, and probably require a new prime minister, with the backing of voters in a general election. European Council President Donald Tusk has said he believes Brexit can be halted - but there is some debate about whether the Article 50 process, the two-year legal mechanism taking the UK out of the EU, is reversible. (You can read a fullBBC Reality Check on the debate here.) If the UK did leave and wanted to immediately rejoin, it would need all the other EU member states to agree. A less formal version of staying in the EU would be if the UK strikes a deal that keeps it in the EU's trade arrangements - the customs union and the single market - and agrees to free movement of people and the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. This would amount to staying in the EU, Brexiteers argue. The UK government has ruled this out but there have been a number of people calling for a fresh vote - includingJustine Greening. Reality Check: How would the UK hold a second EU referendum? With Parliament apparently split over what kind of Brexit it wants, a referendum on the final deal agreed by Theresa May in Brussels might yet end up being the only way to break the deadlock. Those campaigning for another referendum say voters should get the final say, including the option of staying in. Labour's leadership say a general election should be held rather than another referendum.

"A no-deal Brexit would make it harder to protect UK citizens, a leading police officer has warned. The Home Office has given Â£2m to police to work on replacing systems such as the European Arrest Warrant. Sara Thornton, chair of the National Police Chiefs' Council said fallback systems would be slower. She said it could be harder to pursue suspects like those blamed for thepoisoning of a former Russian double agent and his daughter in March. EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier hasruled out Britain using the European Arrest Warrant after Brexit. At the moment, it is used more than 1,500 times a year. UK Police face losing access to 40 law enforcement tools under a no-deal Brexit, such as the Schengen Information System, an intelligence database used 539 million times last year by British authorities to look up suspects and vehicles. The fallback is an Interpol system which is not automated. It takes an average of six days to check whether a foreign national has criminal convictions in their home country under existing systems. Under a no-deal Brexit, that would rise to an estimated 66 days, according to Met Police Deputy Assistant Commissioner Richard Martin. Ms Thornton said: ""The fallbacks we're going to have to use will be slower, will be more bureaucratic and it will make it harder for us to protect UK citizens and make it harder to protect EU citizens. ""We are determined to do everything we can to mitigate that, but it will be hard."" She said the case of the suspected Russian military officers believed to have carried out the Novichok attack in Salisbury illustrated the problem. ""If they are to step out of Russia into Europe there are European Arrest Warrants waiting for them. ""If we lose the European Arrest Warrant on March 29 because there was no deal, no agreement, then we have to rely on the 1957 convention and its longer, more complicated extradition process and they don't always apply in all countries."" Other systems which could be lost include: Europol - the EU law enforcement agency, which was co-ordinating 51 joint investigations involving the UK, as of February 2018. Britain is also one of the biggest contributors of intelligence to the organisation. ECRIS - the European Criminal Records Information System, used for around 173,000 criminal records checks a year by the UK. EMPACT - the European Multidisciplinary Platform Against Crime Threats, which is used in the fight against serious and organised crime, as well as trafficking. Steve Rodhouse, director general of operations at the National Crime Agency, said: ""Our ability to track criminals' movements, monitor sex offenders and locate fugitives will be reduced."" He said UK law enforcement was ""preparing for all possible outcomes"" but that alternative approaches would be ""much more labour-intensive and time-consuming"". The National Police Chiefs' Council has set up a 50-person unit to determine how to replace systems lost with the end of EU agreements. Another team is examining what new pressures policing a hard Brexit might create. These might include transport disruption and changes in patterns of crime and disorder. Chief Constable Charlie Hall, the council's lead for operations, said they were using lessons learned in the riots of 2011 in England.

"Khalid Masood drove his hire car into pedestrians before crashing it into the railings around Parliament Security at the Palace of Westminster ""completely failed"" the unarmed police officer killed in the terror attack on its grounds, an inquest has heard. Khalid Masood stabbed PC Keith Palmer to death on 22 March 2017 in New Palace Yard, after mowing down and killing four pedestrians on Westminster Bridge. The latest instructions for armed officers told them to focus on the gate where PC Palmer was stationed. But the Old Bailey inquest heard this system had ""not functioned for years"". PC Lee Ashby - one of two authorised firearms officers (AFOs) on duty in the yard at the time of the attack - said he would have fired at Masood if he had had a clear shot from a fixed post at the gate. Instead, he and his colleague PC Nicholas Sanders were positioned at the other side of the yard where they could not see or hear the carnage unfolding, and no AFOs had been near the gates for almost an hour. It meant Masood was able to run from his car towards the Houses of Parliament, where he was confronted by PC Palmer. After stabbing the officer to death, Masood was shot and killed by armed police. PC Ashby, an experienced marksman, accepted it was not possible to provide effective cover for the gates on his patrol and agreed the system left unarmed officers unprotected at the entrance ""more often than not"". He said an opportunity to save PC Palmer's life had ""possibly"" been lost. PC Ashby said he was responsible for patrolling ""sector three"" of the courtyard, which included the Members' Entrance, Carriage Gates and College Green. The court heard that the most recent instructions for New Palace Yard dated from 2015 and ordered them to focus on the Carriage Gates. But PC Ashby told the Old Bailey he had never seen the up-to-date ""post instructions"" for where to be stationed and that officers worked from a map posted on a wall that dated from 2012. An email chain, which included the chief inspector of operations for the palace, Nick Aldworth, revealed concerns had been raised over the positioning of armed officers as early as February 2015. PC Ashby said he was unaware of the guidance and instead followed instructions given by his sergeants in daily briefings. The lawyer representing PC Palmer's widow Michelle, Dominic Adamson, said: ""The system of security at the Palace of Westminster completely failed to protect PC Palmer on that day?"" PC Ashby said: ""It would seem so, sir."" The barrister continued: ""Because it had not functioned for years?"" ""Based on the sector three map, which I was responsible for, yes,"" the officer replied. Westminster attack: What happened Victims of the Westminster terror attack Who was attacker Khalid Masood? PC Ashby and his colleague PC Nicholas Sanders faced a misconduct investigation after the attack but no formal action was taken. The investigation highlighted ""poor practice"" from a ""misjudged interpretation"" of what they were allowed to do on patrol, but said ""this practice was not unique to these officers"". Mr Adamson suggested it was an ""extraordinary situation"" where armed officers ""had no idea what they were supposed to be doing"" and that ""lax"" security arrangements had persisted for years. ""The sector area, sector three, was too big, too large for two officers,"" PC Ashby replied. Earlier, the inquest heard from pathologists on how the victims from the bridge had been killed. Kurt Cochran, 54, Leslie Rhodes, 75, Aysha Frade, 44, and Andreea Cristea, 31, were all hit by Masood's car. Consultant pathologist Ashley Fegan-Earl told the inquest the vehicle was as ""lethal as a knife or a gun"" and caused them ""unsurvivable"" injuries. Ms Cristea, an interior designer from Romania, was thrown 10ft into the air after being hit by the car, then fell 41ft into the River Thames below. She had been lying face down and unconscious in the water for five minutes before being pulled out and died in hospital two weeks later. Mr Fegan-Earl said her head injuries were ""highly likely"" to have killed her, even if she had not gone into the water. Asked if she might have survived if she had been lifted out of the water sooner by the crew of a tourist boat, he answered: ""I suspect not."" Clockwise from top left - PC Keith Palmer, Aysha Frade, Leslie Rhodes, Andreea Cristea and Kurt Cochran all lost their lives American tourist Mr Cochran pushed his wife Melissa out of the way moments before he was hit and fell head-first over a railing and onto the pavement, the court heard. He suffered multiple bruises, fractures and brain injuries and his ""survival period would have been brief"", said pathologist Dr Simon Poole. A lawyer for Mr Cochran's sister asked why medics had not given him chest compressions at the scene, and whether it could have made a difference. Dr Poole said: ""I don't think so."" He added that the seriousness of Mr Cochran's head injuries were ""unsurvivable"". The inquest heard Mr Rhodes also suffered a ""devastating"" head injury when he was struck by the car, before being thrown onto the road. He was taken to King's College Hospital in London but died around 24 hours later. Dr Fegan-Earl said: ""The injury was devastating, unsurvivable and, in my opinion, it would have rendered him deeply unconscious straight away. ""There was no issue with the medical treatment he received and the formal cause of death was given as head injury."" Asked if Mr Rhodes could have survived if he had been transported by air ambulance, he replied, ""In my opinion, no."" Ms Frade's death ""would have been near instantaneous and in my opinion without suffering"" when she was struck from behind, thrown into the air and under the wheels of a double-decker bus, said Dr Fegan-Earl. He said she suffered a ""devastating, unsurvivable head injury"", as well as ""devastating internal injuries"" and fractures to her lower limbs. She would have been rendered unconscious immediately when she was hit, he added.

"This video can not be played The bus crashed into a branch of Sainsbury's A bus driver who crashed into a shop, killing two people, was driving dangerously when he caused the deaths, a trial of facts has found. The double-decker bus driven by Kailash Chander smashed into a Sainsbury's supermarket in October 2015. Rowan Fitzgerald, seven, and Dora Hancox, 76, died when the bus crashed in Trinity Street, Coventry. Mr Chander, 80, from Leamington Spa, was judged unfit to plead or stand trial at Birmingham Crown Court. The former town mayor was diagnosed with dementia after the crash. The court heard Mr Chander had been warned about his ""erratic"" driving by bus company Midland Red after four crashes in the previous three years. He had worked for more than 70 hours in the week leading up to the crash. Mr Chander mistook the accelerator for the brake before the fatal smash, prosecutors said. Kailash Chander has been judged medically unfit to enter a plea or stand trial He had also been the subject of eight warning letters triggered by a ""spy-in-the-cab"" system installed by Midland Red in 2014 to monitor braking, acceleration and speeding. Seven months before the crash, Mr Chander was referred to the company's driving school, which sent an anonymous assessor to report on his driving. The instructor said the journey was ""uncomfortable and erratic"" and ""would not have been good enough"" to pass an initial training driving test. Midlands Live: Addresses searched in terror investigation; Prince William visit - ""he's not the ginger one"" Jurors were also shown CCTV footage of Mr Chander - who struggled to punch a ticket moments before the crash as his hands were shaking - steering the bus as it careered over a pavement into the supermarket. Passenger Casper Mudenhatold the court it felt like ""the bus was out of control"". Rowan, a primary school pupil from Leamington, died of a head injury. He had been sitting at the front of the upper deck at the time of the crash on 3 October 2015. Rowan Fitzgerald attended St Anthony's Catholic Primary School in Leamington Spa In a statement Rowan's family said ""no sentence would ever stop the hurt that we feel"" for his loss and called for a change in the law preventing people driving buses in old age. Pedestrian Ms Hancox, from Nuneaton, was struck by the bus and a falling lamppost. Jurors deliberated for around three hours on Tuesday before finding Mr Chander was driving dangerously when he caused the two deaths and serious injury to two other passengers, including Rowan's eight-year-old cousin. They were not asked to return verdicts of guilty because Mr Chander was mentally unfit to take part in the hearing. Mr Chander's dementia diagnosis meant he was deemed unfit to plea or stand trial His dementia diagnosis may have meant he was unable to ""break out"" of a state of hyper-vigilance as he pressed the accelerator instead of the brake. The court also heard while no brake lights were seen during the 12-second journey of the bus, the lights became illuminated seven seconds after the crash. He had experienced suicidal thoughts, was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder and depression, and was ""very preoccupied"" by the crash, the court heard. The jury was instead invited to rule on whether Mr Chander ""did the acts"" alleged. Dora Hancox was one of two people killed in the crash Defence lawyers acting for Mr Chander had argued his conduct was careless because it did not fall far below the standard expected of a competent driver. But prosecution QC Andrew Thomas told the jury: ""In the scale of driver errors, nothing could be more obvious, and nothing could be more devastating, than putting your foot down on the throttle pedal and accelerating over a prolonged period of time when you are supposed to be braking."" This video can not be played CCTV captures Coventry bus crash which killed two people Mr Chander could face a supervision order at a further hearing due to take place in November. Bus company Midland Red (South), which has pleaded guilty to health and safety law breaches, faces an unlimited fine and will be sentenced on Friday. A spokesman said: ""We are deeply sorry for the heartache of those affected, particularly the families of Rowan Fitzgerald and Dora Hancox."" A member of the public who saw the bus speeding towards the supermarket and told pedestrians to get out of the way has been commended for bravery by the police. ""I am certain that his bravery on the day saved many other lives,"" Sgt Alan Wood said of 35-year-old Tiel Portlock, who can be seen waving his arms urging people to move in CCTV footage of the crash.

"This video can not be played Sir Vince Cable: ""Brexit... can and must be stopped."" ""Brexit is not inevitable - it can and it must be stopped,"" Sir Vince Cable has told his party's annual conference. The Lib Dem leader said 29 March next year - the date the UK is set to leave the EU - was ""only a maybe"". He claimed there was a growing realisation that Brexit will be ""costly and painful"", particularly in a no-deal scenario. And he urged Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn to get behind the cross-party campaign for another referendum. Mrs May has said there will not be another referendum ""under any circumstances"" and Mr Corbyn has said he would prefer a general election. It's my Brexit deal or no deal, May says Cable: Lib Dems will oppose Chequers plan EU could give UK more time - Clegg Sir Vince spoke for 45 minutes and received a standing ovation from the party faithful in the Brighton conference centre for what was a sombre, thoughtful address with few jokes. Some of the loudest cheers came when he said Jeremy Corbyn should resign as Labour leader if he does not agree to demands from his own MPs and party members for a referendum on the final Brexit deal at their party conference next week. ""If Jeremy Corbyn will not say 'I will support a People's Vote and I will fight Brexit', Labour members should wave him goodbye,"" said Sir Vince. ""He is currently letting down the many people in Labour's heartland who now see Brexit for what it is. It's a Tory project, pursued for Tory ends, of which working people will be the main victims.""

He described Tory Brexiteers like Jacob Rees-Mogg, as ""fundamentalists"" for which ""the costs of Brexit have always been irrelevant"". He was due to say that ""years of economic pain justified by the erotic spasm of leaving the European Union. Economic pain felt - of course - not by them by those least able to afford it."" However Sir Vince mangled the ""erotic spasm"" line that had grabbed most of the overnight headlines: Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The Lib Dem leader took aim at what he described as Tory ""chancers"" like Michael Gove and Boris Johnson, who he said had only backed Brexit to further their own leadership ambitions. He said Mr Johnson was a ""real danger to Britain"", comparing him with US President Donald Trump. ""He doesn't just resemble Trump - large, loud and blonde - he behaves more like him by the day. ""Their cynical disregard for the truth, their treatment of women, and their inflammatory divisive language make Boris and Donald the 'terrible twins of the rabid right'."" It was Sir Vince's second leader's speech to conference Mr Gove, on the other hand, was the ""ideal man for a penalty shoot out - right to the last moment you never know which way he will go"". The Lib Dem leader, who has said he will step down when Brexit has been ""resolved or stopped"", has put the chances of another referendum at about ""30%"". But he is talking to anti-Brexit Labour and Conservative MPs about how to get a second referendum, possibly by tabling a new bill or an amendment to legislation already going through Parliament, with proposed referendum questions. I'm not the next Lib Dem leader - Miller Do Lib Dem members want a new party? Tax wealthy to tackle inequality - Cable He claimed Theresa May, who voted Remain in the 2016 EU referendum but has vowed to deliver on the will of the people, knows ""deep down"" that Brexit is a ""bad idea"" whose ""time has gone"". He urged her to show ""true leadership"" by admitting that staying in the EU will be better than any deal she can get in Brussels. ""Instead of kowtowing to her enemies in the Conservative Party, she could lead her party and the country by opening her mind to a 'People's Vote' on the final deal"", he said. Sir Vince's predecessor Tim Farron listens to the speech This video can not be played In full: Sir Vince Cable's full speech to 2018 Lib Dem conference The Lib Dem leader also used his speech to set out a vision of a ""liberal future"" for Britain after the ""Brexit nightmare"" has been stopped, vowing to ""restore a sense of fairness and opportunity to a country where both have been lost"". He set out plans, announced at the weekend, to set up a Â£100bn citizens' fund to spread the UK's wealth more evenly, paid for, in part, by abolishing inheritance tax and replacing it with a ""levy on large financial gifts received over a lifetime"". The Lib Dems would also increase taxes on the wealthy, tackle homelessness, solve the housing crisis and combat racism, while controlling immigration, he said, referring to his ""personal experience of racism"" in the late 1960s. ""My wife and children were being denounced as people whose very presence here would lead to rivers foaming with blood. And I was thrown out of the parental home,"" he told his party conference.

"Celia BarquÃ­n Arozamena won the European Amateur Championship in July A homeless man has been charged in the murder of prominent Spanish golfer Celia BarquÃ­n Arozamena, 22, who was found dead on an Iowa golf course. Ms BarquÃ­n won the European Ladies' Amateur championship in July and was a top athlete at Iowa State University. She was found on Monday at the Coldwater Golf Links in the city of Ames, with several stab wounds to her head, neck and upper body, police say. Ms BarquÃ­n is the second female student in Iowa to be killed in recent months. Police in the Iowa city said they had determined that Ms BarquÃ­n died following an assault. Collin Daniel Richards, also 22, has been charged with first-degree murder, police say. He was ordered to be jailed on Tuesday. Ms BarquÃ­n was found on Monday in Ames, about 30 miles (50km) north of Des Moines, after police were called to investigate an unattended golf bag on the course early on Monday. ""It's still very troubling for something like this to happen in broad daylight in a community that is as safe as Ames is,"" Police Cmdr Geoff Huff said at a news conference on Tuesday. Originally from Puente San Miguel in Spain, Ms BarquÃ­n was finishing her degree in civil engineering this semester, the university said. During her time in the US, she rose to prominence as a young golfer and was named Iowa State Female Athlete of the Year. She had also missed the first few weeks of university life in Iowa while participating in the Youth Olympic Games in China. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Her successful amateur career reached its highest point when she won the European Ladies Amateur Championship less than two months before her death. Ms BarquÃ­n shot a course-record 63 at Slovakia's Penati Golf Resort in the third round on her way to a one-shot victory. That came shortly after her win at the Big 12 Championship, a major American collegiate golf event. Her European win had secured her an invitation to the professional Women's British Open next year at Woburn, and she also qualified for the professional 2018 US Women's Open. Allow Twitter content?

Described as an ""outstanding team player"" by the Royal Spanish Golf Federation, she was part of the Spanish team that came third and second at the 2015 and 2016 European Amateur Team Championships. Nacho GervÃ¡s, technical director of the Spanish Golf Federation, told El PaÃ­s newspaper: ""She was a player who was heading for the very top, without a doubt."" Collin Daniel Richards had his first court appearance, lasting only minutes, on Tuesday. According to local media, he had been charged with several crimes in the past,,externalincluding trespassing, public intoxication, and intimidation with a dangerous weapon. Story County Attorney Jessica Reynolds said authorities consider Richards homeless, and believe the crime to be ""a random act of violence"". A police dog tracked BarquÃ­n's scent to a homeless encampment near the course where Richards had been living, according to the complaint. Collin Daniel Richards was found with scratches on his face, police say An acquaintance of Richards told police in recent days he spoke of his ""urge to rape and kill a woman,"" according to the complaint. Police have not said whether Ms BarquÃ­n was sexually assaulted. Richards was later found by officers with ""several fresh scratches on his face consistent with a fight and was attempting to conceal a laceration his left hand,"" added Cmdr Huff. Investigators also found two pairs of shorts with traces of blood and a knife the suspect allegedly gave to two other people after the attack, according to the complaint. Those two people had planned to drive Richards out of town, but the suspect asked to stop at the encampment to collect his tent. It was there officers arrested him. Cmdr Huff said that there was no known relationship between the suspect and the victim. ""We are all devastated,"" said Iowa State's head women's golf coach, Christie Martens. ""Celia was a beautiful person who was loved by all her team-mates and friends."" In a video profile of the young golfer published in April, Ms BarquÃ­n spoke about how Ms Martens had been ""like my second mom, always taking care of me"". Iowa State said she ""was one of the most accomplished players in Cyclone golf history"", referring to the university's sporting nickname. Ms BarquÃ­n will be honoured by the university at a football game on Saturday, a statement said. Her team withdrew from the East & West Match Play tournament in Ann Arbor, Michigan so that her teammates could return to campus to grieve. The European Golf Association paid tribute to ""a delightful young lady who inspired all who met her"". In her native Spain, her death made headlines and many came forward to express their sympathy. Spanish professional golfer Azahara MuÃ±oz posted a photo of the two together on Instagram, writing: ""Waking up to the news that Celia won't be around anymore is heartbreaking.""

"Khalid Masood drove his hire car into pedestrians before crashing it into the railings around Parliament Security at the Palace of Westminster ""completely failed"" the unarmed police officer killed in the terror attack on its grounds, an inquest has heard. Khalid Masood stabbed PC Keith Palmer to death on 22 March 2017 in New Palace Yard, after mowing down and killing four pedestrians on Westminster Bridge. The latest instructions for armed officers told them to focus on the gate where PC Palmer was stationed. But the Old Bailey inquest heard this system had ""not functioned for years"". PC Lee Ashby - one of two authorised firearms officers (AFOs) on duty in the yard at the time of the attack - said he would have fired at Masood if he had had a clear shot from a fixed post at the gate. Instead, he and his colleague PC Nicholas Sanders were positioned at the other side of the yard where they could not see or hear the carnage unfolding, and no AFOs had been near the gates for almost an hour. It meant Masood was able to run from his car towards the Houses of Parliament, where he was confronted by PC Palmer. After stabbing the officer to death, Masood was shot and killed by armed police. PC Ashby, an experienced marksman, accepted it was not possible to provide effective cover for the gates on his patrol and agreed the system left unarmed officers unprotected at the entrance ""more often than not"". He said an opportunity to save PC Palmer's life had ""possibly"" been lost. PC Ashby said he was responsible for patrolling ""sector three"" of the courtyard, which included the Members' Entrance, Carriage Gates and College Green. The court heard that the most recent instructions for New Palace Yard dated from 2015 and ordered them to focus on the Carriage Gates. But PC Ashby told the Old Bailey he had never seen the up-to-date ""post instructions"" for where to be stationed and that officers worked from a map posted on a wall that dated from 2012. An email chain, which included the chief inspector of operations for the palace, Nick Aldworth, revealed concerns had been raised over the positioning of armed officers as early as February 2015. PC Ashby said he was unaware of the guidance and instead followed instructions given by his sergeants in daily briefings. The lawyer representing PC Palmer's widow Michelle, Dominic Adamson, said: ""The system of security at the Palace of Westminster completely failed to protect PC Palmer on that day?"" PC Ashby said: ""It would seem so, sir."" The barrister continued: ""Because it had not functioned for years?"" ""Based on the sector three map, which I was responsible for, yes,"" the officer replied. Westminster attack: What happened Victims of the Westminster terror attack Who was attacker Khalid Masood? PC Ashby and his colleague PC Nicholas Sanders faced a misconduct investigation after the attack but no formal action was taken. The investigation highlighted ""poor practice"" from a ""misjudged interpretation"" of what they were allowed to do on patrol, but said ""this practice was not unique to these officers"". Mr Adamson suggested it was an ""extraordinary situation"" where armed officers ""had no idea what they were supposed to be doing"" and that ""lax"" security arrangements had persisted for years. ""The sector area, sector three, was too big, too large for two officers,"" PC Ashby replied. Earlier, the inquest heard from pathologists on how the victims from the bridge had been killed. Kurt Cochran, 54, Leslie Rhodes, 75, Aysha Frade, 44, and Andreea Cristea, 31, were all hit by Masood's car. Consultant pathologist Ashley Fegan-Earl told the inquest the vehicle was as ""lethal as a knife or a gun"" and caused them ""unsurvivable"" injuries. Ms Cristea, an interior designer from Romania, was thrown 10ft into the air after being hit by the car, then fell 41ft into the River Thames below. She had been lying face down and unconscious in the water for five minutes before being pulled out and died in hospital two weeks later. Mr Fegan-Earl said her head injuries were ""highly likely"" to have killed her, even if she had not gone into the water. Asked if she might have survived if she had been lifted out of the water sooner by the crew of a tourist boat, he answered: ""I suspect not."" Clockwise from top left - PC Keith Palmer, Aysha Frade, Leslie Rhodes, Andreea Cristea and Kurt Cochran all lost their lives American tourist Mr Cochran pushed his wife Melissa out of the way moments before he was hit and fell head-first over a railing and onto the pavement, the court heard. He suffered multiple bruises, fractures and brain injuries and his ""survival period would have been brief"", said pathologist Dr Simon Poole. A lawyer for Mr Cochran's sister asked why medics had not given him chest compressions at the scene, and whether it could have made a difference. Dr Poole said: ""I don't think so."" He added that the seriousness of Mr Cochran's head injuries were ""unsurvivable"". The inquest heard Mr Rhodes also suffered a ""devastating"" head injury when he was struck by the car, before being thrown onto the road. He was taken to King's College Hospital in London but died around 24 hours later. Dr Fegan-Earl said: ""The injury was devastating, unsurvivable and, in my opinion, it would have rendered him deeply unconscious straight away. ""There was no issue with the medical treatment he received and the formal cause of death was given as head injury."" Asked if Mr Rhodes could have survived if he had been transported by air ambulance, he replied, ""In my opinion, no."" Ms Frade's death ""would have been near instantaneous and in my opinion without suffering"" when she was struck from behind, thrown into the air and under the wheels of a double-decker bus, said Dr Fegan-Earl. He said she suffered a ""devastating, unsurvivable head injury"", as well as ""devastating internal injuries"" and fractures to her lower limbs. She would have been rendered unconscious immediately when she was hit, he added.

"Fidel Glasgow died after being stabbed outside a club Police advice to pubs to look out for ""young black males who look as though they are intent on committing disorder"" has been branded inflammatory. A Coventry police officer sent an email to the city's Pubwatch scheme following thefatal stabbing of Fidel Glasgow, the grandson of Specials singer Neville Staple. Race equality think tank the Runnymede Trust said it was racial profiling. West Midlands Police called the wording of the email unfortunate. Midlands Live: Addresses searched in terror investigation; Two injured in Coventry shooting Mr Glasgow was stabbed to death during an incident outside Club M in Coventry on 1 September. Last week an officer emailed publicans and nightclub owners about a heightened alert over black males ""who may be intent on reprisal"". ""Large gatherings of young black males who look as though they are intent on committing disorder should be rung in on either 999s if an incident is occurring or 101,"" the email said. Neville Staple's grandson was stabbed to death in Coventry on 1 September The Runnymede Trust's deputy director Zubaida Haque said: ""A young black male victim was tragically murdered, and instead of being sensitive about how black males in that community might be feeling scared, the police has severely worsened trust in the police by essentially racially profiling them."" Dr Haque said the email was also ""inflammatory"" because it gave responsibility to pub and nightclub door staff to judge what is suspicious. Does profiling make sense - or is it unfair? 'Stopped under a police power I'd never heard of' 'I've been stopped and searched 400 times' ""If you have a gathering of young black men laughing and talking loudly, is that suspicious?"" The Equality and Human Rights Commission, the national equality body, said it expected West Midlands Police to investigate the matter to ensure it is meeting its legal duties. Supt Phil Healy, from Coventry Police, ruled out ""malicious intent"" by the officer who wrote the email, but said the wording would not be repeated. He said: ""This incident underlines the care that's needed when communicating with our communities, to ensure nothing can be taken out of context or cause offence.""

"Amanda Reid competed as a swimmer during the 2012 London Paralympic Games A Paralympic athlete has been accused of exaggerating symptoms, a BBC investigation has found. Amanda Reid (formerly Fowler) won a silver medal in cycling for Australia at the Rio Games in 2016. Her former coach and other athletes who spoke to the BBC's File on 4 said they were highly suspicious about the changes in her condition. Reid and her mother did not respond to detailed BBC questions about the allegations. The Australian Paralympic Committee strongly denied any knowledge of misconduct relating to classification. It said Reid had multiple disabilities and had undergone the same rigorous medical testing as other athletes. Reid, who was then known as Amanda Fowler, was classified as an intellectually disabled swimmer when she competed at the London Paralympics in 2012, finishing fifth. Her new coach after the London Games, Simon Watkins, said Amanda's mother told him that she thought her daughter may have a rare genetic disorder with symptoms similar to cerebral palsy. She enquired whether she might be able to change her classification to a physical disability. He said he was emphatic about his own opinion: ""She doesn't have a physical disability. So there isn't a way that you get a classification for physical disability. There isn't one present."" A fellow swimmer who competed at the same time and who doesn't want to reveal her name agreed. ""There was absolutely no sign of any sort of physical impairment. She was quite boisterous and used her arms quite a bit for emphasis when she was talking,"" she said. Disabled athletes are classified by a panel of volunteers based on how their impairment affects their performance. They are assessed by a technical classifier, often a coach in that sport, and a medical classifier, such as a physiotherapist. Part of their role is trying to spot intentional misrepresentation, where an athlete might exaggerate the level of their disability so they could be placed in a category where it would be easier for them to win medals. At a training camp a few months later, Simon Watkins said an official from the governing body Swimming Australia approached him and expressed concerns that at a physiotherapy session Reid ""was trying to put on an issue with the leg and foot, which we don't believe is a real issue"". Simon Watkins stopped coaching Reid in 2014. When he saw her again in 2015, she was competing as a visually impaired athlete. He said he was amazed as he had never seen any evidence of this before. ""This is a girl who had been driving a car. So now to be with a white stick... was quite unbelievable."" His doubts were shared by the fellow swimmer. She said that in her view, Reid used her white stick as if it were a prop. She would also maintain direct eye contact for long periods and then ""would suddenly almost put on an act as if she couldn't see you and wouldn't be able to meet your eyes directly"". The swimmer says she didn't bother to challenge this as she had come across other athletes she thought were exaggerating symptoms: ""It's almost accepted [that] that's just the way it is and there's almost no point challenging it."" 'I'm heartbroken and handing back my medal' Simon Watkins wrote to Swimming Australia to express his concerns. He told them he believed Amanda Reid's family had made a joke of the classification system and ""the integrity of the system in Australiaâ¦ and makes the country a joke on the international scene"". Swimming Australia told him the classification for Amanda was ongoing. The BBC asked Swimming Australia about this but they did not reply. Reid dropped out of competitive swimming. At the Rio Olympics in 2016 Reid competed as a cyclist in a new classification for physically disabled athletes. In interviews she said she had cerebral palsy,external. She won a silver medal in the sprint and at the medal ceremony now walked with a turned-in foot and holding her arm, seemingly with cerebral palsy-like symptoms. Amanda Reid won a silver medal in the 500m time trial C1-3 during the 2016 Paralympic Games in Rio An athlete in the Australian team said he and others were shocked at the change in her physical appearance and there was scepticism about her success: ""Going from not medalling in swimming to being a silver medallist at a Para Games isâ¦ virtually unheard of, so I guess there's always going to be a dubious aspect to that."" Cycling's governing body, the UCI, said Amanda Reid had followed the normal classification process. They said they would assess whether they needed to investigate the allegations about her classification. File on 4 has obtained video footage from 2017 showing Amanda Reid walking to her car with no apparent physical disabilities and getting into the driver's seat. Robert Shepherd, a former international classifier, watched the footage. ""It is very unlikely that you'll make that degree of improvementâ¦ The presentation that we've seen on these videos makes me doubt that she is of a level that would give her the classification she's got."" Is it possible to make such rapid improvements with cerebral palsy? Richard Grunewald, clinical director of neuroscience at Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, said: ""The damage of cerebral palsy is permanent brain damage, it doesn't come and go."" The Australian Paralympic Committee said Amanda Reid has multiple impairments and can therefore be classified with a physical, visual or intellectual disability. They said such cases are not unique and said that her classifications in both cycling and swimming ""have followed the international classification rules"". Before the Rio Paralympics, the International Paralympic Committee investigated 80 athletes for intentional misrepresentation, but none were found to have deliberately exaggerated their disability. All swimmers are now being reclassified, with the tests in the water being made more rigorous and objective. Some track athletes are also facing reclassification. File on 4 has learned that a British Paralympic medallist, who has not been named publicly, is currently being investigated for possible cheating. As part of their evidence gathering, investigators have spoken to former British Paralympic gold medal swimmer Marc Woods, who has voiced his concerns about classification. He told File on 4 he is worried that young, vulnerable athletes are being manipulated by older coaches to think they are more disabled than they actually are, which he describes as a form of grooming. Paralympic classification: Everyone is cheating system, says former chief executive Para tests involve 'sickening pain' ""It's a word that sends shivers down my spine,"" he said. ""But I think that there can be a process where coaches are using a dialogue, which will eventually lead to an athlete thinking they maybe should be categorised differently."" Ian Braid used to run the British Athletes Commission, which represents 1,500 elite British athletes. He said during his four years in charge he heard growing concerns about abuse of the classification system, which led to a particularly bizarre incident. ""I was told that in one team event members of the British squad were cheering for another nation, another nation's athlete, because they believed that a member of their [own] team was in the wrong class,"" he said. The British Paralympic Association (BPA) introduced a new athlete classification code earlier this year. The BPA's chief executive Tim Hollingsworth doesn't think cheating is happening on any meaningful scale. ""I don't see that from the conversations we have with governing bodies,"" he says. ""I don't see that from the conversations that we have with athletes."" You can hear more on this story onBBC Radio 4's File on 4programme on Tuesday 18 September at 20:00 BST.

"The Mini factory in Oxford will shut down for a month after Brexit at the end of March to minimise disruption in case of a no-deal outcome. Owner BMW said its summer maintenance shutdown had been brought forward to 1 April to reduce any ""possible short-term parts-supply disruption"". ""While we believe this worst case scenario is an unlikely outcome, we have to plan for it,"" BMW said. The German firm said it ""remained committed"" to its UK operations. The Cowley plant, on the outskirts of Oxford, will remain open in April with maintenance, management and catering staff continuing to work despite no cars being made. It employs 4,500 people and produces 5,000 cars a week. BMW said the downtime would be used to start preparing the plant to make the new electric Mini. The concern is that in the event of the UK leaving the EU without a deal on 29 March, there could be disruption at the borders and shortages of parts. Hundreds of lorries a day arrive at Cowley with parts from across the world, with 60% of components coming from the EU. Theo Leggett, BBC business correspondent Factory shutdowns are common in the car industry. Machinery needs to be repaired or replaced and updates or modifications to production lines carried out. Usually at Mini this happens during the summer and is built into the carmaker's output planning. What BMW has done is simply reschedule that shutdown to coincide with a potential period of serious disruption at the borders after Brexit, if we leave the EU without a deal. If the plant is not actually making cars, then a shortage of imported parts should not be so much of a problem. The company says a no-deal outcome is unlikely, but has to be planned for. Rescheduling the annual shutdown looks like a relatively simple and inexpensive piece of contingency planning. Nevertheless, it does send out a political message. It's a reminder that carmakers are particularly reliant on frictionless borders, to ensure parts arrive where they're needed at exactly the right time. And it shows that BMW is taking the risk of a no-deal Brexit seriously. Add that to comments made by the Jaguar Land Rover boss last week suggesting that the wrong Brexit deal could cost tens of thousands of jobs, and it suggests that people within the industry are getting rather nervous right now. This video can not be played How British is a Mini? Other carmakers with British operations have warned that a bad or no Brexit deal would be damaging for the UK car industry. Earlier on Tuesday, the head of Honda Europe, Ian Howells,told the BBC that a no-deal Brexit would cost his company tens of millions of pounds. ""In terms of administration, we'd probably be looking at something like sixty odd thousand additional bits of documentation we would have to provide to get product to and from Europe,"" Mr Howells told BBC Radio 5 live. ""And clearly if we end up with World Trade Organization tariffs we'd have something like 10% costs in addition on our shipped product back into Europe, and that would certainly run into tens of millions of pounds."" Last week, Jaguar Land Rover boss Ralf Speth warned the government to get ""the right Brexit"" orit could wipe out profits at the carmaker and lead to big job cuts. On Tuesday the company said about 1,000 workers at its Castle Bromwich plant in Birmingham wouldmove from a five-day to a three-day weekfrom October until Christmas. JLR - the UK's largest carmaker - said it was making ""temporary adjustments"" to its production schedules at the factory, which produces Jaguar cars. How British is a Mini?

"This video can not be played The 70th annual Emmy awards did not disappoint Claire Foy, Thandie Newton and Charlie Brooker were among the British winners at the 70th Primetime Emmy Awards. Foy won the best actress in a drama series for her role as Queen Elizabeth II in Netflix's royal epic The Crown. Welsh actor Matthew Rhys also took home one of the night's big prizes - best leading actor in a drama series. Game of Thrones won two prizes - best drama series and supporting actor for Peter Dinklage - while The Marvelous Mrs Maisel scooped five comedy awards. However, two hotly-tipped shows - Atlanta and The Handmaid's Tale - failed to replicate their successes from last year and went home empty-handed. Elisabeth Moss had been the pre-show favourite to win best drama actress for the second season of The Handmaid's Tale, but lost out to Foy. The 8 best moments (and 1 that didn't happen) In pictures: The Emmys red carpet The ceremony's winners in full In her acceptance speech, the British star described her time on The Crown as ""the most extraordinary two-and-a-half years of my life"". She said: ""I was given a role I never thought I would ever get a chance to play, and I met people who I will love for ever and ever. ""And the show goes on, which makes me so proud. So I dedicate this to the next cast, the next generation, and I also dedicate this to [her co-star] Matt Smith."" Thandie Newton: ""I don't even believe in God but I'm going to thank her tonight"" Olivia Colman is due to take over the role from Foy as the show enters its third season. Stephen Daldry won best directing for a drama series for The Crown. Newton was awarded best supporting actress in a drama series for her role in Westworld. ""I don't even believe in God but I'm going to thank her tonight,"" the actress said as she took to the stage to collect her trophy. Rhys picked up best leading actor in a drama series for his role in The Americans. Set in suburban Washington DC shortly after Ronald Reagan is elected president, the series tells the story of two KGB spies in an arranged marriage who are posing as Americans. Matthew Rhys won best leading actor in a drama - one of the night's biggest prizes ""Parts like these come along so rarely. I will forever be in your debt,"" he told series creator Joe Weisberg in his speech. Matthew Rhys' accent surprises Welsh fans The Emmy-winning TV shows you've never heard of Charlie Brooker, the British creator of Black Mirror and his co-writer William Bridges won best writing for a limited series. John Oliver added to the British success at the ceremony, picking up the prize for best variety talk series for Last Week Tonight with John Oliver. The Marvellous Mrs Maisel was one of the night's other biggest winners - adding five trophies to the four it wonlast week at the Creative Arts Emmys. The series took home best writing, directing, lead actress and supporting actress in the comedy categories, as well as one of the night's big prizes - best comedy series. Henry Winkler took home a trophy - 42 years after his first nomination The Assassination of Gianni Versace was also one of Monday's big winners - scooping best limited series, best directing for a limited series, and best lead actor in a limited series for Darren Criss. Henry Winkler won his first Emmy - supporting actor in a comedy series for his role in Barry - 42 years after he was first nominated for playing The Fonz in Happy Days. ""Skip Brittenham said to me a long time ago, 'If you stay at the table long enough, the chips come to you,' and tonight I got to clear the table,"" he said in his acceptance speech. Biggest Emmy winners (including Creative Arts awards) Game of Thrones - 9 Saturday Night Live - 8 The Marvelous Mrs Maisel - 8 The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story - 7 Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown - 5 Jesus Christ Superstar Live In Concert - 5 RuPaul's Drag Race - 5 The Crown - 5 Jeff Daniels took home the prize for best supporting actor in a limited series or a television movie for his role in Netflix's Godless - described as a feminist western. In addition to his family and co-workers, Daniels thanked the streaming service for ""letting artists be artists"". He added: ""Little tip for you young actors - when they call and say 'Can you ride a horse?' don't lie. You will find on day one that you're in the Kentucky Derby."" Regina King received the best actress in a limited series award from RuPaul and Leslie Jones Put together with the Creative Arts Emmys handed out last week, this year's awards tally saw Netflix and HBO tied, with 23 awards each. But one of the night's most memorable moments came from Glen Weiss, who proposed to his girlfriend from the stage during his speech. This video can not be played Emmys proposal While accepting outstanding directing for a variety special for The Oscars, he spoke to his partner Jan Svendsen, who was sitting in the audience. ""You wonder why I don't like to call you my girlfriend? Because I want to call you my wife,"" he said as the crowd began cheering. Svendsen, who looked shocked and delighted, then made her way up to the stage to accept his proposal. Weiss said he was giving her the ring ""that my dad put on my mom's finger 67 years ago"". His proposal came just two weeks after the death of his mother, which he also referred to in his speech. Rhys joked about the moment later in the night, telling the audience as he collected his award that his girlfriend had whispered to him: ""If you propose to me I will punch you clean in the mouth."" Sandra Oh's mother rocks hanbok at Emmys Colin Jost and Michael Che are hosting the ceremony The ceremony took place at the Microsoft Theatre in Los Angeles, with Kenan Thompson and Kate McKinnon kicking off proceedings. ""We're celebrating the fact that this year's Emmy Awards has the most diverse group of nominees in Emmy history,"" Thompson said. ""One step closer to a black Sheldon,"" he joked - referring to The Big Bang Theory's most famous character. The pair then embarked on a parody song called We Solved It - suggesting the Emmys had single-handedly fixed Hollywood's lack of diversity - which featured cameo appearances from Sandra Oh and John Legend. John Legend made an appearance in the opening musical number about Hollywood diversity - titled We Solved It Ceremony hosts Colin Jost and Michael Che then took to the stage - referencing the fact that streaming service Netflix received the most nods this year in their opening monologue. ""NBC has the most nominations of any broadcast network,"" Che said, adding: ""Which is kind of like being the sexiest person on life support"". Because the Emmys have a total of 122 categories, the less high profile awards weregiven out last weekend at the Creative Arts Emmys, with 26 awarded on Monday night.

"The Il-20 aircraft was returning to a Russian base on the north-western coast of Syria (file photo) Russia has said Syria shot down one of its military planes - but laid the blame for the deaths of the 15 personnel on board with Israel. The defence ministry said Israeli jets put the Il-20 plane into the path of Syrian air defence systems on Monday after failing to give Moscow enough warning of a strike on Syrian targets. The Il-20 disappeared off the radar at about 23:00 local time (20:00 GMT). The Israel Defence Force (IDF) has expressed ""sorrow"" over the deaths. A tour of Syria - with the Russian military Russia and Turkey to create Syria buffer zone However,in a statement released on Twitter,external, it added: ""Israel holds the [Syrian President Bashar al-]Assad regime, whose military shot down the Russian plane, fully responsible for this incident."" It went on to say its jets were back in Israeli airspace by the time the missiles were launched. Israel - which also blamed Iran and Hezbollah - rarely acknowledges carrying out strikes on Syria, but an Israeli military official recently said it had hit more than 200 Iranian targets in Syria over the past 18 months. The Israeli government is concerned by what it calls Iran's ""military entrenchment"" in Syria, as well as shipments of Iranian weapons to the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, which is fighting alongside Syrian government forces. The details are murky, and Russia's account of the incident has yet to be verified. Monday's incident is reported to have occurred about 35km (22 miles) from the Syrian coast as the Ilyushin Il-20 aircraft was returning to Russia's Hmeimim airbase near the north-western city of Latakia. Russia's Tass news agency says the Il-20 plane ""disappeared during an attack by four Israeli F-16 jets on Syrian facilities in Latakia province"". Reports on Syrian state media spoke of an attack in the area shortly before the plane disappeared. According to Sana news agency, the military said it had intercepted ""enemy missiles coming from the open sea towards the city of Latakia"". Syrian television also reported explosions over the sky in Latakia just before 22:00. Thirty minutes later, the Sana Facebook page reported that Syrian air defences had responded to enemy missiles. In a statement, Russia said Israel's ""irresponsible actions"" were to blame, saying it was given less than a minute's warning ahead of the strikes, which was not enough time to get the military surveillance plane out of the way. ""The Israeli planes deliberately created a dangerous situation for surface ships and aircraft in the area,"" a defence ministry spokesman said. The spokesman accused Israeli pilots of ""using the Russian airplane as a cover"", putting it ""in the line of fire coming from Syrian air defence systems"". Photos 'reveal' Russia jet damage at Hmeimim base Why is there a war in Syria? The plane, the spokesman continued, was shot down by a Syrian missile. ""As a result of the irresponsible actions by the Israeli military, 15 Russian servicemen have died,"" the spokesman said. It is not possible to verify any of these claims. The IDF said its jets were targeting Syrian military facilities ""from which systems to manufacture accurate and lethal weapons were about to be transferred on behalf of Iran to Hezbollah in Lebanon"". It added the Syrian anti-aircraft missiles were ""inaccurate"" and ""extensive"". What's more, it claimed its jets were back in Israeli airspace by the time the missiles were launched. The statement also accused the Syrian military of failing ""to ensure that no Russian planes were in the air"", adding it would share the relevant information with Moscow. In an earlier phone call on Tuesday, Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu told his Israeli counterpart Avigdor Lieberman the blame ""fully rests with Israel"", adding that Russia ""reservesÂ the right to take further steps in response"". Russia later summoned the Israeli ambassador to its foreign ministry. A search-and-rescue operation is under way. Analysis by Jonathan Marcus, BBC Defence Correspondent Russia's anger is real. But the question is, are the Russians attributing blame fairly? The charges are two-fold. Long-standing and up to now effective information-sharing broke down. The Israeli Air Force has Russian-speaking air traffic controllers able to communicate with their Russian opposite numbers. But Moscow says they were informed of the Israeli raid with only one minute's notice. Secondly Russia charges - more seriously - that the Israelis used the large radar signature of the Ilyushin turbo-prop to mask their own aircraft. But the radar signatures of the relatively slow Ilyushin and four nimble F-16 jets are radically different. Furthermore, the Syrian air defences should have known the Russian plane was in-bound, whatever the Israelis were doing. There may be several contributory factors in this tragedy. Russia cannot publicly castigate its Syrian allies. In private things may be rather different. Russia began military strikes in Syria in 2015 after a request from President Bashar al-Assad, who has stayed in power despite seven years of civil war which has so far killed more than 350,000 people. The Russian military said in April of this yearit had also spent 18 months helping to rebuild the air defence system,external, according to the UK's Guardian newspaper. Hmeimim is Russia's main base for air strikes on rebel groups in Syria - strikes that have enabled President Assad's forces to recover much lost ground since 2015. Russia says its air strikes only target ""terrorists"", but activists have said they mainly hit mainstream rebel fighters and civilians. According to The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group, at least 7,928 civilians and 10,069 combatants have been killed in Russian strikes. Russia has also suffered personnel losses, including the deaths of 39 people whena Russian military transport plane crashed as it attempted to landat Hmeimim in March.

"The Il-20 aircraft was returning to a Russian base on the north-western coast of Syria (file photo) The leaders of Russia and Israel have sought to defuse tension after a Russian plane was shot down by Syrian forces amid an Israeli air raid. In a call to Vladimir Putin, Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu expressed regret at the loss of 15 Russian personnel, but stressed again that Syria was to blame. Mr Putin had earlier called the incident ""a chain of tragic accidental circumstances"". The Il-20 plane was downed over the Mediterranean Sea on Monday evening. What will be the fallout of the Russian deaths? A tour of Syria - with the Russian military Russia is supporting President Bashar al-Assad in Syria's civil war. Mr Putin and Mr Netanyahu spoke by telephone on Monday, shortly after the Russian president had made his conciliatory statement in Moscow. Mr Putin said at a media briefing: ""It looks most likely in this case that it was a chain of tragic chance events, because an Israeli aircraft did not shoot down our aircraft. But, without any doubt we need to seriously get the bottom of what happened."" Mr Netanyahu addressed that issue in the telephone call, offering to provide ""all necessary information"" in the investigation of the incident, as well as expressing regret over the fatalities. In the call, Mr Putin urged Mr Netanyahu ""not to let such a situation happen in the future"" and told him Israeli air operations breached Syrian sovereignty, Russian media said. Russia's Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu had earlier said that Moscow ""reservesÂ the right to take further steps in response"". But Mr Putin said the ""retaliatory measures"" would be ""aimed first and foremost at further ensuring the safety of our military personnel"". The BBC's defence and diplomatic correspondent, Jonathan Marcus, says the crisis will almost certainly blow over as Israel and Russia have a remarkably close relationship and Moscow has until now not interfered with Israeli operations. Russia's Tass news agency said an Ilyushin Il-20 reconnaissance plane had ""disappeared during an attack by four Israeli F-16 jets on Syrian facilities in Latakia province"". Photos 'reveal' Russia jet damage at Hmeimim base Why is there a war in Syria? The downing was reported to have occurred about 35km (22 miles) from the Syrian coast as the Il-20 aircraft was returning to Russia's Hmeimim airbase near Latakia. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said its aircraft were targeting Syrian military facilities ""from which systems to manufacture accurate and lethal weapons were about to be transferred on behalf of Iran to Hezbollah in Lebanon"". The Lebanese Shia militant group and Iran are both allies of the Syrian government. Israel has reportedly hit more than 200 Iranian targets in Syria over the past 18 months. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group said some Israeli missiles did find the target and two people were killed on the ground. However, it could not confirm their identity and Syria has made no official comment. Both the Russians and Israelis agree it was Syrian anti-aircraft fire, although Syria has not commented. Russia said it was given less than a minute's warning by Israel ahead of the strikes, which was not enough time to get the military surveillance plane out of the way. It also said the Israeli planes had ""used the Russian airplane as a cover"", putting it ""in the line of fire coming from Syrian air defence systems"". Israel disputes this.In a rare statement detailing its operations over Syria,external, the IDF said: ""The Russian plane that was hit was not within the area of the operation... when the Syrian army launched the missiles that hit the Russian plane, (Israeli) jets were already within Israeli airspace."" The Russian defence ministry said body fragments, personal belongings and the plane's debris had been found by search ships in the Mediterranean on Tuesday. Israel was adamant. The IDF said: ""Israel holds the Assad regime, whose military shot down the Russian plane, fully responsible for this incident."" The statement also laid blame on Iran and Hezbollah. In his phone call with Mr Putin, Mr Netanyahu insisted that Israel would continue to target Iran inside Syria. Russia and Turkey to create Syria buffer zone In an initial statement, Russia said: ""The Israeli planes deliberately created a dangerous situation for surface ships and aircraft in the area. ""As a result of the irresponsible actions by the Israeli military, 15 Russian servicemen have died."" Analysis by Jonathan Marcus, BBC Defence Correspondent Russia is clearly angry. It has lost an aircraft and the lives of its 15-person crew. It needs to register its displeasure but is also reluctant to condemn its regional ally Syria. Israel and Russia have a remarkably close relationship and a clear understanding about Israel Defense Forces (IDF) operations in the region. So might this episode change this? I think that is doubtful. For one thing the air campaign in Syria is seen by Israel as a vital strategic necessity to thwart, as they see it, Iran's growing influence. And for Russia to try to physically interfere with Israeli operations would go entirely against the policy pursued by Moscow up till now.

"This video can not be played Sir Vince Cable: ""Brexit... can and must be stopped."" ""Brexit is not inevitable - it can and it must be stopped,"" Sir Vince Cable has told his party's annual conference. The Lib Dem leader said 29 March next year - the date the UK is set to leave the EU - was ""only a maybe"". He claimed there was a growing realisation that Brexit will be ""costly and painful"", particularly in a no-deal scenario. And he urged Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn to get behind the cross-party campaign for another referendum. Mrs May has said there will not be another referendum ""under any circumstances"" and Mr Corbyn has said he would prefer a general election. It's my Brexit deal or no deal, May says Cable: Lib Dems will oppose Chequers plan EU could give UK more time - Clegg Sir Vince spoke for 45 minutes and received a standing ovation from the party faithful in the Brighton conference centre for what was a sombre, thoughtful address with few jokes. Some of the loudest cheers came when he said Jeremy Corbyn should resign as Labour leader if he does not agree to demands from his own MPs and party members for a referendum on the final Brexit deal at their party conference next week. ""If Jeremy Corbyn will not say 'I will support a People's Vote and I will fight Brexit', Labour members should wave him goodbye,"" said Sir Vince. ""He is currently letting down the many people in Labour's heartland who now see Brexit for what it is. It's a Tory project, pursued for Tory ends, of which working people will be the main victims.""

He described Tory Brexiteers like Jacob Rees-Mogg, as ""fundamentalists"" for which ""the costs of Brexit have always been irrelevant"".

The Lib Dem leader took aim at what he described as Tory ""chancers"" like Michael Gove and Boris Johnson, who he said had only backed Brexit to further their own leadership ambitions. He said Mr Johnson was a ""real danger to Britain"", comparing him with US President Donald Trump. ""He doesn't just resemble Trump - large, loud and blonde - he behaves more like him by the day. ""Their cynical disregard for the truth, their treatment of women, and their inflammatory divisive language make Boris and Donald the 'terrible twins of the rabid right'."" It was Sir Vince's second leader's speech to conference Mr Gove, on the other hand, was the ""ideal man for a penalty shoot out - right to the last moment you never know which way he will go"". The Lib Dem leader, who has said he will step down when Brexit has been ""resolved or stopped"", has put the chances of another referendum at about ""30%"". But he is talking to anti-Brexit Labour and Conservative MPs about how to get a second referendum, possibly by tabling a new bill or an amendment to legislation already going through Parliament, with proposed referendum questions.

Tax wealthy to tackle inequality - Cable He claimed Theresa May, who voted Remain in the 2016 EU referendum but has vowed to deliver on the will of the people, knows ""deep down"" that Brexit is a ""bad idea"" whose ""time has gone"". He urged her to show ""true leadership"" by admitting that staying in the EU will be better than any deal she can get in Brussels. ""Instead of kowtowing to her enemies in the Conservative Party, she could lead her party and the country by opening her mind to a 'People's Vote' on the final deal"", he said. Sir Vince's predecessor Tim Farron listens to the speech This video can not be played In full: Sir Vince Cable's full speech to 2018 Lib Dem conference The Lib Dem leader also used his speech to set out a vision of a ""liberal future"" for Britain after the ""Brexit nightmare"" has been stopped, vowing to ""restore a sense of fairness and opportunity to a country where both have been lost"". He set out plans, announced at the weekend, to set up a Â£100bn citizens' fund to spread the UK's wealth more evenly, paid for, in part, by abolishing inheritance tax and replacing it with a ""levy on large financial gifts received over a lifetime"". The Lib Dems would also increase taxes on the wealthy, tackle homelessness, solve the housing crisis and combat racism, while controlling immigration, he said, referring to his ""personal experience of racism"" in the late 1960s. ""My wife and children were being denounced as people whose very presence here would lead to rivers foaming with blood. And I was thrown out of the parental home,"" he told his party conference. Sir Vince also used his speech to set out plans to transform his party, which has 12 MPs and has languished in the opinion polls since being in coalition with the Tories, into a ""movement for moderates"" and open up its next leadership contest to non-MPs. He said the party was still ""very pale and very male"", adding: ""We must change that and keep growing.""

"Fidel Glasgow died after being stabbed outside a club Police advice to pubs to look out for ""young black males who look as though they are intent on committing disorder"" has been branded inflammatory. A Coventry police officer sent an email to the city's Pubwatch scheme following thefatal stabbing of Fidel Glasgow, the grandson of Specials singer Neville Staple. Race equality think tank the Runnymede Trust said it was racial profiling. West Midlands Police called the wording of the email unfortunate. Midlands Live: Addresses searched in terror investigation; Two injured in Coventry shooting Mr Glasgow was stabbed to death during an incident outside Club M in Coventry on 1 September. Last week an officer emailed publicans and nightclub owners about a heightened alert over black males ""who may be intent on reprisal"". ""Large gatherings of young black males who look as though they are intent on committing disorder should be rung in on either 999s if an incident is occurring or 101,"" the email said. Neville Staple's grandson was stabbed to death in Coventry on 1 September The Runnymede Trust's deputy director Zubaida Haque said: ""A young black male victim was tragically murdered, and instead of being sensitive about how black males in that community might be feeling scared, the police has severely worsened trust in the police by essentially racially profiling them."" Dr Haque said the email was also ""inflammatory"" because it gave responsibility to pub and nightclub door staff to judge what is suspicious. Does profiling make sense - or is it unfair? 'Stopped under a police power I'd never heard of' 'I've been stopped and searched 400 times' ""If you have a gathering of young black men laughing and talking loudly, is that suspicious?"" The Equality and Human Rights Commission, the national equality body, said it expected West Midlands Police to investigate the matter to ensure it is meeting its legal duties. Supt Phil Healy, from Coventry Police, ruled out ""malicious intent"" by the officer who wrote the email, but said the wording would not be repeated. He said: ""This incident underlines the care that's needed when communicating with our communities, to ensure nothing can be taken out of context or cause offence.""

"WBO middleweight world champion Billy Joe Saunders Police are investigating a video which appears to show world boxing champion Billy Joe Saunders offering a woman drugs. The footage shows the boxer inside a Rolls Royce encouraging a woman to punch a passer-by and perform a sex act on his friend in exchange for ""crack"". A Nottinghamshire Police spokesperson said it is aware of the ""sickening"" video and a full investigation will be carried out. The 29-year-old boxer has apologised. Allow Twitter content?

The British Boxing Board of Control has charged the WBO middleweight champion with misconduct and is organising a hearing for next week. In the video, the boxer tells the woman he will give her Â£150 worth of ""crack cocaine"" in exchange for his demands. He asks her if she would be willing to perform a sex act on his friend and punch a man walking past, who he claims is a ""paedophile"". Billy Joe Saunders asks the woman to swear not to tell anyone who gave her the drugs and she agrees. After she hits the passer-by, the boxer tells her the man is not a paedophile and then drives off with his friends laughing. Billy Joe Saunders represented Team GB at the Beijing Olympics in 2008 There is no evidence that Billy Joe Saunders was in possession of any drugs or intended to supply drugs to the woman. A Nottinghamshire Police spokesperson said it is aware of a video circulating where a woman is offered drugs in exchange for committing an act of violence, and potentially committing a sex act in public. ""Officers will be looking to identify and speak to all of those who feature in this sickening video, and a full investigation will be carried out into the number of offences that have been captured on film.""

"China has hit back at President Donald Trump by announcing new trade tariffs on $60bn of US goods. It comes after the US slapped duties on $200bn of Chinese imports to take effect from next Monday, escalating its trade war with Beijing. China will target goods such as liquefied natural gas, produced in states loyal to the US president. However, in a tweet, Mr Trump warned Beijing against seeking to influence the upcoming US midterm elections. ""There will be great and fast economic retaliation against China if our farmers, ranchers and/or industrial workers are targeted!"" he said. Earlier he had suggested that this would mean further US tariffs on another $267bn worth of Chinese products. Such a move would mean roughly all of China's exports to the US would be subject to new duties. The Chinese commerce ministry said it would impose its tariffs from 24 September - the date the US duties come into effect - but at lower rates than previously expected. It will place an additional 5% in duty on US products including smaller aircraft, computers and textiles, and an extra 10% on goods such as chemicals, meat, wheat and wine. By contrast, the US duties will apply to almost 6,000 items, making them the biggest round of trade tariffs yet from Washington. They will affect handbags, rice and textiles, although some items such as smart watches and high chairs have been exempted. They will start at 10% and increase to 25% from the start of next year unless the two countries agree a deal. China and trade: Playing dirty or misunderstood victim? Trade wars, tariffs and protectionism explained The early victims of Trump's trade war Trade row: What has happened so far? Six ways China could retaliate in a trade war On Monday Mr Trump said the latest round of tariffs was in response to China's ""unfair trade practices"". ""We have been very clear about the type of changes that need to be made, and we have given China every opportunity to treat us more fairly. But, so far, China has been unwilling to change its practices,"" he said. Yes. In fact, the latest round of US duties marks the third set of tariffs put into motion so far this year. In July, the White House increased charges on $34bn worth of Chinese products. Then last month, the escalating trade war moved up a gear whenthe US brought in a 25% tax on a second wave of goods worth $16bn. This latest round means that about half of all Chinese imports to the US are now subject to the new duties. Unlike the earlier rounds, the list also targets consumer goods such as luggage and furniture. That means households may start to feel the impact from higher prices. US companies have already said they are worried about the effect of higher costs on their businesses and warned of the risk of job cuts. Trump tariffs will hurt global growth, IMF warns Will Trump's tariffs stop Chinese espionage? Many everyday items such as suitcases, handbags, toilet paper and wool are included in this latest round of tariffs. The list also includes food items,externalfrom frozen cuts of meat, to almost all types of fish, soybeans, various types of fruit and cereal and rice. The Apple Watch is one of the items to escape the tariffs The list of Chinese products slated for tariffs originally included more than 6,000 items, but US officials later removed about 300 types of items, including smart watches, bicycle helmets, play pens, high chairs and baby car seats. The changes come after fierce opposition from US companies including Apple and Dell, which fear the tariffs will increase their costs as many of their products are made in China. Earlier this month, Apple wrote to US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer warning that consumers would have to pay more for its products as a result of the proposed tariffs. At the time, Mr Trump replied with a tweet urging Apple: ""Make your products in the United States instead of China."" US tech firms ask for protection from next Trump tariffs This video can not be played Why the US-China trade war will hit most of our pockets The White House says its tariffs are a response to China's ""unfair"" trade policies. The import charges will make Chinese-made products more expensive - a move intended to convince US businesses and consumers to buy elsewhere. US officials hope the risk to the Chinese economy willconvince Beijing to change its policies. But many US businesses are critical of the tariffs with farmers, manufacturers, retailers and other industry groups calling them taxes on American families. Before its latest round of tariffs, China had previously imposed duties on $50bn of US products in retaliation, targeting key parts of the president's political base, such as farmers. The aim is to put pressure on businesses in states that supported Donald Trump in the 2016 US presidential election. The European Union has also used the tactic in its trade skirmishes with the US. Not really. Talks between high-level officials ended in May without resolving the matter and efforts to restart discussions have failed. US and China officials had discussed a new round of talks over the past week, but Mr Trump's latest move is likely to sour relations further. Andrew Walker, BBC economics correspondent The immediate objective of President Trump's action against China is to address what he calls the theft of American companies' technology, but it also plays into his wider concern about the US trade deficit. He sees it as something that needs to be corrected and as the result of bad trade agreements and unfair trading by other countries. The trouble is that a trade deficit is generally regarded as being the result of savings and investment decisions rather than trade policy. A country that spends more than it earns has a trade deficit. President Trump's other policies include tax cuts that could increase government borrowing, which is equivalent to cutting national saving and could create a bigger trade deficit. What Mr Trump hopes is that the tax cuts will boost economic activity so much that they will generate more revenue - and ""pay for themselves"". That's another area of economic controversy.

"Catrin Pugh suffered 96% burns after a bus crash in the French Alps A woman who was given a one in 1,000 chance of survival after being badly burned in a coach crash has posed at London Fashion Week. Catrin Pugh was part of the Portrait Positive show, featuring women with facial disfigurements and conditions. She was left with 96% burns and had to undergo more than 200 operations after the crash in the French Alps in 2013. Miss Pugh, 24 and from Wrexham, told BBC Radio Wales diversity in fashion was greatly needed. ""You don't often see people with scars and birthmarks, and any kind of facial difference or bodily difference represented,"" she said. The models were photographed by Rankin, and wore clothes designed by Steven Tai as part of a campaign created with charity Changing Faces. Woman recovers from 96% crash burns Alps coach driver 'knew he would crash' Britons in fatal Alps coach crash Miss Pugh was among more than 50 passengers on the coach that crashed as it travelled from the ski resort of Serre Chevalier, killing the 63-year-old driver. Shepreviously toldhow she could remember seeing ""everything going on fire"" and then lying on the roadside ""screaming in pain"". ""The next thing I remember is waking in the burns unit at Whiston three months later,"" she said. The campaigner has had over 200 operations since the crash After also spending three months in a coma as a result of the crash, she now encourages others to celebrate their differences. ""Every single person is different, and you can find beauty in everybody,"" she said.

""There were days when I didn't want to get up I didn't want to do anything, but you have to. There's not something to explain it you just have to get through it."" She adds that she does sometimes still grapples with her appearance, but knows how far she has come: ""I sometimes look at myself and just think, 'Why me?' The scene of the French Alps coach crash ""I know what I looked like when I was 19 compared to now, and the scars... they don't look the same. I know what that smooth, perfect - or implied perfect - skin is supposed to look like, and I don't look like that anymore. ""So it can be difficult, but I do say I'm stronger, I'm a happier as person, which means I do look at myself and just think it proves how far I've come, how hard I've worked and it shows how strong I am.""

"This video can not be played Man who shot planning boss in front of TV cameras has died A man who shot dead a planning officer in view of TV cameras to protect an illegally built bungalow has died in a care home a year after being freed. Albert Dryden gunned down Derwentside Council officer Harry Collinson in Butsfield, County Durham, in June 1991. He was convicted of murder and the attempted murder of a solicitor. Dryden was released from prison last year after suffering a stroke and died, aged 78, at the weekend. He was also convicted of wounding a police officer and BBC journalist Tony Belmont. Alex Watson, leader at the time of the since abolished Derwentside Council, was a lifelong friend of Dryden. Now an independent Durham County Councillor, he said the case was ""tragic"" especially as Dryden and Mr Collinson also knew each other well. Dryden was still building the bungalow on the day he started shooting He said: ""I'd known Albert all my life - he was well known in the area and was very private. ""He loved the countryside like Harry Collinson did. They had interests that they shared and it went on for years. ""Albert would come in and have a cup of tea with Harry and they would talk about the situation. ""But Harry was quite adamant that what Albert was doing (building the bungalow without permission) was wrong."" Dryden opened fire on Mr Collinson and a solicitor, Michael Dunstan, as they led a council operation to demolish the bungalow he had built on a smallholding down a country lane. When Mr Collinson, a 46-year-old divorced father of two, fell wounded into a ditch, Dryden hit him with two further shots. Mr Collinson's older brother, Roy, has dismissed claims Dryden had recently shown remorse for the murder. He said he had received four letters written by his brother's killer from his prison cell, but described them all as the ""ravings of a madman"". ""Not once did he show any remorse, culpability, or regret for what he had done,"" he said. ""He looked to blame everyone but himself. At one stage he even tried to blame the vehicles that were going to knock down his house, claiming they were not taxed or something ridiculous like that. ""I get so annoyed when people try to rewrite history, and look at things from a different angle. No excuses can be made for what Albert Dryden did."" Harry Collinson was shot twice more as he lay in a ditch When asked whether Dryden's death would bring any comfort to his family, Mr Collinson said: ""It's over, but what he has done is going to impact generations of this family to come. Good riddance to the man."" Mr Watson, who had visited Dryden a few weeks before his death, said: ""It was quite tragic - devastating for Harry's family because this was a killing that should never have happened. ""It should have been prevented - the media and the police were there. ""The police were well warned about the situation because Albert had this passion for collecting weapons."" Meet the 107-year-old who fought fires in the Blitz Cat brings home suspected bag of drugs TripAdvisor suspends reviews for tunnel During Dryden's trial at Newcastle Crown Court in April 1992, the former steelworker claimed he was mentally unwell and not responsible for his actions - a claim that was rejected by the jury.

"The UK narrowly voted in favour of Leave in the EU referendum, but with six months to go until Brexit, where does the country stand now? From whether the UK should hold another referendum, to what Brexit means for the economy, the opinion polls reveal a great deal about what the country thinks. Immediately beforelast year's general election, as many people thought the government was handling the negotiations well as felt it was doing so badly. But confidence fell away quickly when Theresa May lost her Commons majority. By last autumn nearly three times as many people thought the government was handling things badly (61%) as believed it was doing a good job (22%). Since thecabinet reached the Chequers agreementon how to handle the UK's future relationship with the EU, that ratio has increased further - to five to one. Leave voters have become much more critical, with only about 20% thinking the government is doing well, compared with 70% who feel it is doing badly. But voters are critical not only of the government. The polling organisation NatCen recently found 57% think the EU is handling the talks badly, while only 16% believe it is doing well. Meanwhile, polls consistently find that voters are still more likely to trust the Conservatives than Labour on the issue. Voters have also become increasingly pessimistic about how good a deal the UK will get. Until last year's general election, more people agreed than disagreed that the prime minister would secure a good deal, but thereafter, monthly polls have suggested that only about a third think the UK will get the right deal, while nearly half do not. Confidence fell yet further after the Chequers agreement. In ORB's most recent poll just 22% agreed that the prime minister will get the right deal, while 59% disagreed. Unsurprisingly, those who voted Remain have long been pessimistic. Even as long ago as September 2016, only 17% thought the UK would secure a good outcome. But doubts are now also widespread among Leave voters. According to NatCen, 40% now think the UK will get a bad deal, while just 22% reckon it will get a good one. More voters think that Brexit will be bad for the economy than believe it will be beneficial. That was also the position before the referendum. However, despite the continuing debate about the economic consequences of Brexit, the balance of opinion has shifted little. According to ICM's most recent poll, 44% of people think Brexit will be bad for the economy. That is an almost identical proportion to the 43% who held that view 18 months ago. But attitudes towards the economic consequences do seem to influence whether voters would vote the same way in another referendum. Only about half of Leave voters who now think that Brexit will be bad for the economy would vote the same way again, a recent NatCen survey found. And only two-fifths of Remain voters who now think the economy will be better off after Brexit would vote to stay in the EU again. How young and old would vote on Brexit now What kind of Brexit do voters want? Have voters changed their minds about Brexit? Immigration was a key issue for many of those who voted Leavein 2016, in part due to the EU's rules on freedom of movement. However, some recent polling has suggested that the level of concern has declined. The proportion of people who think the rules on immigration should be the same for EU residents as those from elsewhere in the world fell from 74% in autumn 2016 to 59% now, according to NatCen. But many polls suggest voters remain more or less evenly divided over whether it is more important for the UK to end freedom of movement or stay inthe EU's single market. While most Remain supporters think it is more important to stay in the single market, most of those who voted Leave think ending freedom of movement is more important. Please upgrade your browser Read the full glossary here Before last year's general election, polls that asked people how they would vote if the referendum question was asked again often found a small majority in favour of Leave. But since then, nearly every poll has found a small majority saying that they would vote Remain. However, there is no consistent evidence suggesting that support for Remain has subsequently increased further. The UK remains more or less evenly divided on the merits of Brexit. Some polls find that those who voted Leave are a little less likely than those who backed Remain to say that they would vote the same way again. But this is not the only reason why there appears to have been a small swing to Remain since the referendum. All polls find that those who did not vote in 2016 - in some cases because they were too young to do so - are more likely to say they would vote Remain rather than Leave. So, should another referendum ever be held, the outcome might well depend on who turns out. More like this Why it's OK to have 'bad manners' Would a bigger house make you happier? Are our online lives about to become 'private' again? What Airbnb really does to a neighbourhood Whether people support a second referendum depends on what they are asked. Polls that ask whether voters should have the final say on Brexit typically find more support for the idea than those that simply ask if there should be another referendum. Similarly, polls that ask whether there should be another ballot tend to find more support than those specifying the choice would be between accepting whatever deal is agreed and remaining in the EU. The question that has been asked most often is: ""Do you think there should be a second referendum to accept or reject the terms of Britain's exit from the EU once they have been agreed?"" This idea has gradually become more popular - even more so in the wake of the Chequers agreement. But there may still not be a majority in favour. Unsurprisingly perhaps, this is an issue on which Remain and Leave supporters disagree. Irrespective of how they ask about it, polls typically find that around two-thirds of Remain voters would like another ballot However, the majority - maybe as many as two-thirds - of those who backed Leave are against the idea.

"Several strawberry brands have been withdrawn from sale Australian police say sewing needles have been found hidden in an apple and a banana, amid a nationwide scare that has tormented the strawberry industry. Since last week, Australians in every state have reported finding needles concealed in strawberry punnets. Health Minister Greg Hunt has called it a ""vicious crime"" and ordered the nation's food watchdog to assist in resolving the scare. Police said the apple and banana cases, both in Sydney, were ""isolated"". But they added to more than 20 scares involving strawberries in New South Wales (NSW) alone, Supt Daniel Doherty said. The first cases emerged in Queensland. In that state, authorities say they are investigating whether the sabotage is due to one person, or several people operating independently. In the most serious case, a man was taken to hospital last week after eating a strawberry that contained a needle. Police have stepped up warnings about copycat incidents, saying perpetrators - and those who make false reports - face up to 10 years in jail. The scare has spread to Victoria, the Australian Capital Territory, South Australia, Tasmania and Western Australia. Several strawberry brands have been withdrawn, while New Zealand's biggest grocers have stopped selling Australian strawberries as a precaution. Health officials have advised Australians to cut up strawberries before eating them. Six of eight states and territories have been affected ""This is a very vicious crime and it's a general attack on the public,"" Mr Hunt said at the weekend. Queensland police say complicated supply chains in the strawberry industry have made for a slow investigation. Two states have offered A$100,000 (Â£55,000; $72,000) rewards for information. In Western Australia, Premier Mark McGowan said the people who tampered with fruit were ""evil"" and risked others' lives. Strawberry prices have already dropped around the country, with prices in Western Australia now below the cost of production, local media reported. The scare - which comes during the peak of production - has affected thousands of workers in an industry worth about A$130m a year, the federal government said. Australia's strawberry needle scare widens Tainted pomegranate kills woman Melon listeria kills three in Australia Queensland has announced a A$1m assistance package for farmers in the state. One manager of berry farms, Gavin Scurr, asked the public to continue buying strawberries. ""There's a handful of cases in 100 million punnets but it's really brought our industry to its knees,"" Mr Scurr, from PiÃ±ata Farms, told radio station 3AW. Strawberry producers had begun ordering metal detectors as a safety precaution, said Strawberry Growers Association of Western Australia president Neil Handasyde.

"Catrin Pugh suffered 96% burns after a bus crash in the French Alps A woman who was given a one in 1,000 chance of survival after being badly burned in a coach crash has posed at London Fashion Week. Catrin Pugh was part of the Portrait Positive show, featuring women with facial disfigurements and conditions. She was left with 96% burns and had to undergo more than 200 operations after the crash in the French Alps in 2013. Miss Pugh, 24 and from Wrexham, told BBC Radio Wales diversity in fashion was greatly needed. ""You don't often see people with scars and birthmarks, and any kind of facial difference or bodily difference represented,"" she said. The models were photographed by Rankin, and wore clothes designed by Steven Tai as part of a campaign created with charity Changing Faces. Woman recovers from 96% crash burns Alps coach driver 'knew he would crash' Britons in fatal Alps coach crash Miss Pugh was among more than 50 passengers on the coach that crashed as it travelled from the ski resort of Serre Chevalier, killing the 63-year-old driver. Shepreviously toldhow she could remember seeing ""everything going on fire"" and then lying on the roadside ""screaming in pain"". ""The next thing I remember is waking in the burns unit at Whiston three months later,"" she said. The campaigner has had over 200 operations since the crash After also spending three months in a coma as a result of the crash, she now encourages others to celebrate their differences. ""Every single person is different, and you can find beauty in everybody,"" she said.

The British fashion designers to watch out for How it feels to be a model at London Fashion Week Despite her positivity, Miss Pugh says there were times when she has struggled to carry on. ""There were days when I didn't want to get up I didn't want to do anything, but you have to. There's not something to explain it you just have to get through it."" She adds that she does sometimes still grapples with her appearance, but knows how far she has come: ""I sometimes look at myself and just think, 'Why me?' The scene of the French Alps coach crash ""I know what I looked like when I was 19 compared to now, and the scars... they don't look the same. I know what that smooth, perfect - or implied perfect - skin is supposed to look like, and I don't look like that anymore. ""So it can be difficult, but I do say I'm stronger, I'm a happier as person, which means I do look at myself and just think it proves how far I've come, how hard I've worked and it shows how strong I am.""

"Jade Owen underwent spinal surgery in America to help stop spasticity A 20-year-old woman with cerebral palsy is finding her feet after an anonymous donor helped fund her bid for spinal surgery in America. Jade Owen has spent years trying to raise funds for treatment, and received just over Â£37,000 towards her cause earlier this year. Jade, who lives in Bridgend, is now able to walk with assistance. She said: ""I would like to say a massive thank you for such an amazing and generous donation. ""Without the person who donated I wouldn't have been able to get where I am now, and I want to thank them for making my wish to walk come true."" Louis Tomlinson gives $10k to help fan You Tuber: My disability is my motivation,external Girl goes to Germany for spinal surgery While in America, Jade underwent aselective dorsal rhizotomy (SDR),external- aimed at reducing spasticity - and two other operations for her cerebral palsy. Jade Owen and her family had to travel to America for surgery The Bridgend College student explained that the identity of the person was still a mystery: ""The donation was just over Â£37,000... I have no idea who it was from!"" Jade, who has needed to use a wheelchair since she was 11 years old, said she was not able to have the treatment on the NHS because of her age and the severity of her condition. Despite her progress after the treatment in America, Jade believes her prognosis may have been better if she had been able to have the surgery earlier. She said: ""I've been told that if I'd had it when I was younger I would be a lot more independent - like walking by now, there wouldn't be the left over spasticity there. ""It's kind of hard because people go for this operation to get rid of the spasticity and not have any, and having some still thereâ¦ it's like if I had it when I was younger then it'd be a lot more easy.""

""Being able to sit without falling over is amazing. I used to sit with loads of pillows around me and now there's just one - that's a massive step for me,"" she added. Jade also had therapy in America The Welsh Government said the NHS in Wales and in England commissioned SDR treatment as part of a trial to evaluate its effectiveness and the full findings were expected by the end of this year. ""This evidence will be used to consider whether the procedure should be routinely available on the NHS in Wales,"" a spokesman said, ""Where treatments such as SDR are not routinely available within NHS Wales, a clinician may submit a request for the treatment to be funded to an Individual Patient Funding Request (IPFR) panel in the appropriate health board."" The Welsh Health Specialised Services Committee (WHSSC) said it is committed to ""the provision of cost-effective new treatments fairly available to all"" and will undertake an interim review next month ""Funding of Â£200,000 was committed by Welsh Government for paediatric patients to trial SDR treatment,"" said a spokesperson.

"Midwives are calling for official guidance on how much weight is healthy for women to put on during pregnancy. One in five women in the UK are obese when they start pregnancy, yet there is no national target for what constitutes normal pregnancy weight gain. Regular weigh-ins fell out of favour in the 1990s when it was suggested that they cause pregnant women unnecessary anxiety for little or no clinical gain. Officials say they are considering whether to reintroduce them. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) is reviewing its weight advice for pregnancy. Itscurrent guidelines,externalsay weight and height should be measured at the first appointment, but not repeatedly during pregnancy as a matter of routine. US guidelines,externaldo recommend keeping track of weight gain, and set clear targets: Underweight  -     gain 28-40lb (12.7-18.1kg) during pregnancy Normal Weight - gain 25-35lb (11.3-15.9kg) Overweight -        gain 15-25lb (6.8-11.3kg) Obese -                gain 11-20lb (5-9.1kg) NICE says it is considering whether to adopt the same recommendations in its new advice, which is still in the early phases of planning - meaning it is unlikely to be published before 2019. Its current guidelines advise against dieting when pregnant, but do say pregnant women should avoid ""eating for two"". Energy needs do not change in the first six months of pregnancy and increase only slightly in the last three months, when mothers-to-be need around 200 extra calories per day. Mandy Forrester from the Royal College of Midwives (RCM) said some UK midwives were already using the US weight guidelines, but that others did not have access to weighing scales. ""There is a clear need for midwives to have the tools, guidance and training they need so they can offer women the best possible support and care. This is especially pressing because of the potentially serious complications that can arise in pregnancy as a result of women being overweight or obese."" Women who are obese (with a BMI over 30) when they become pregnant face an increased risk of complications such as gestational diabetes, miscarriage and pre-eclampsia. Being over or underweight during pregnancy might also have a negative impact on the baby, according to research. The comments from the RCM come as a new study published in the journalDiabetologia,externalsays either too much or too little weight gain during pregnancy is linked with adverse outcomes in children aged seven years. The Hong Kong study looked at 905 mothers and their children, and found health problems such as high blood pressure and poorer blood sugar control.

"Celia BarquÃ­n Arozamena won the European Amateur Championship in July A homeless man has been charged in the murder of prominent Spanish golfer Celia BarquÃ­n Arozamena, 22, who was found dead on an Iowa golf course. Ms BarquÃ­n won the European Ladies' Amateur championship in July and was a top athlete at Iowa State University. She was found on Monday at the Coldwater Golf Links in the city of Ames, with several stab wounds to her head, neck and upper body, police say. Ms BarquÃ­n is the second female student in Iowa to be killed in recent months. Police in the Iowa city said they had determined that Ms BarquÃ­n died following an assault. Collin Daniel Richards, also 22, has been charged with first-degree murder, police say. He was ordered to be jailed on Tuesday. Ms BarquÃ­n was found on Monday in Ames, about 30 miles (50km) north of Des Moines, after police were called to investigate an unattended golf bag on the course early on Monday. ""It's still very troubling for something like this to happen in broad daylight in a community that is as safe as Ames is,"" Police Cmdr Geoff Huff said at a news conference on Tuesday. Originally from Puente San Miguel in Spain, Ms BarquÃ­n was finishing her degree in civil engineering this semester, the university said. During her time in the US, she rose to prominence as a young golfer and was named Iowa State Female Athlete of the Year. She had also missed the first few weeks of university life in Iowa while participating in the Youth Olympic Games in China. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Her successful amateur career reached its highest point when she won the European Ladies Amateur Championship less than two months before her death. Ms BarquÃ­n shot a course-record 63 at Slovakia's Penati Golf Resort in the third round on her way to a one-shot victory. That came shortly after her win at the Big 12 Championship, a major American collegiate golf event. Her European win had secured her an invitation to the professional Women's British Open next year at Woburn, and she also qualified for the professional 2018 US Women's Open. Allow Twitter content?

Described as an ""outstanding team player"" by the Royal Spanish Golf Federation, she was part of the Spanish team that came third and second at the 2015 and 2016 European Amateur Team Championships. Nacho GervÃ¡s, technical director of the Spanish Golf Federation, told El PaÃ­s newspaper: ""She was a player who was heading for the very top, without a doubt."" Collin Daniel Richards had his first court appearance, lasting only minutes, on Tuesday. According to local media, he had been charged with several crimes in the past,,externalincluding trespassing, public intoxication, and intimidation with a dangerous weapon. Story County Attorney Jessica Reynolds said authorities consider Richards homeless, and believe the crime to be ""a random act of violence"". A police dog tracked BarquÃ­n's scent to a homeless encampment near the course where Richards had been living, according to the complaint. Collin Daniel Richards was found with scratches on his face, police say An acquaintance of Richards told police in recent days he spoke of his ""urge to rape and kill a woman,"" according to the complaint. Police have not said whether Ms BarquÃ­n was sexually assaulted. Richards was later found by officers with ""several fresh scratches on his face consistent with a fight and was attempting to conceal a laceration his left hand,"" added Cmdr Huff. Investigators also found two pairs of shorts with traces of blood and a knife the suspect allegedly gave to two other people after the attack, according to the complaint. Those two people had planned to drive Richards out of town, but the suspect asked to stop at the encampment to collect his tent. It was there officers arrested him. Cmdr Huff said that there was no known relationship between the suspect and the victim. ""We are all devastated,"" said Iowa State's head women's golf coach, Christie Martens. ""Celia was a beautiful person who was loved by all her team-mates and friends."" In a video profile of the young golfer published in April, Ms BarquÃ­n spoke about how Ms Martens had been ""like my second mom, always taking care of me"". Iowa State said she ""was one of the most accomplished players in Cyclone golf history"", referring to the university's sporting nickname. Ms BarquÃ­n will be honoured by the university at a football game on Saturday, a statement said. Her team withdrew from the East & West Match Play tournament in Ann Arbor, Michigan so that her teammates could return to campus to grieve. The European Golf Association paid tribute to ""a delightful young lady who inspired all who met her"". In her native Spain, her death made headlines and many came forward to express their sympathy. Spanish professional golfer Azahara MuÃ±oz posted a photo of the two together on Instagram, writing: ""Waking up to the news that Celia won't be around anymore is heartbreaking.""

"Celia BarquÃ­n Arozamena won the European Amateur Championship in July A homeless man has been charged in the murder of prominent Spanish golfer Celia BarquÃ­n Arozamena, 22, who was found dead on an Iowa golf course. Ms BarquÃ­n won the European Ladies' Amateur championship in July and was a top athlete at Iowa State University. She was found on Monday at the Coldwater Golf Links in the city of Ames, with several stab wounds to her head, neck and upper body, police say. Ms BarquÃ­n is the second female student in Iowa to be killed in recent months. Police in the Iowa city said they had determined that Ms BarquÃ­n died following an assault. Collin Daniel Richards, also 22, has been charged with first-degree murder, police say. He was ordered to be jailed on Tuesday. Ms BarquÃ­n was found on Monday in Ames, about 30 miles (50km) north of Des Moines, after police were called to investigate an unattended golf bag on the course early on Monday. ""It's still very troubling for something like this to happen in broad daylight in a community that is as safe as Ames is,"" Police Cmdr Geoff Huff said at a news conference on Tuesday. Originally from Puente San Miguel in Spain, Ms BarquÃ­n was finishing her degree in civil engineering this semester, the university said. During her time in the US, she rose to prominence as a young golfer and was named Iowa State Female Athlete of the Year. She had also missed the first few weeks of university life in Iowa while participating in the Youth Olympic Games in China. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Her successful amateur career reached its highest point when she won the European Ladies Amateur Championship less than two months before her death. Ms BarquÃ­n shot a course-record 63 at Slovakia's Penati Golf Resort in the third round on her way to a one-shot victory. That came shortly after her win at the Big 12 Championship, a major American collegiate golf event. Her European win had secured her an invitation to the professional Women's British Open next year at Woburn, and she also qualified for the professional 2018 US Women's Open. Allow Twitter content?

Described as an ""outstanding team player"" by the Royal Spanish Golf Federation, she was part of the Spanish team that came third and second at the 2015 and 2016 European Amateur Team Championships. Nacho GervÃ¡s, technical director of the Spanish Golf Federation, told El PaÃ­s newspaper: ""She was a player who was heading for the very top, without a doubt."" Collin Daniel Richards had his first court appearance, lasting only minutes, on Tuesday. According to local media, he had been charged with several crimes in the past,,externalincluding trespassing, public intoxication, and intimidation with a dangerous weapon. Story County Attorney Jessica Reynolds said authorities consider Richards homeless, and believe the crime to be ""a random act of violence"". A police dog tracked BarquÃ­n's scent to a homeless encampment near the course where Richards had been living, according to the complaint. Collin Daniel Richards was found with scratches on his face, police say An acquaintance of Richards told police in recent days he spoke of his ""urge to rape and kill a woman,"" according to the complaint. Police have not said whether Ms BarquÃ­n was sexually assaulted. Richards was later found by officers with ""several fresh scratches on his face consistent with a fight and was attempting to conceal a laceration his left hand,"" added Cmdr Huff. Investigators also found two pairs of shorts with traces of blood and a knife the suspect allegedly gave to two other people after the attack, according to the complaint. Those two people had planned to drive Richards out of town, but the suspect asked to stop at the encampment to collect his tent. It was there officers arrested him. Cmdr Huff said that there was no known relationship between the suspect and the victim. ""We are all devastated,"" said Iowa State's head women's golf coach, Christie Martens. ""Celia was a beautiful person who was loved by all her team-mates and friends."" In a video profile of the young golfer published in April, Ms BarquÃ­n spoke about how Ms Martens had been ""like my second mom, always taking care of me"". Iowa State said she ""was one of the most accomplished players in Cyclone golf history"", referring to the university's sporting nickname. Ms BarquÃ­n will be honoured by the university at a football game on Saturday, a statement said. Her team withdrew from the East & West Match Play tournament in Ann Arbor, Michigan so that her teammates could return to campus to grieve. The European Golf Association paid tribute to ""a delightful young lady who inspired all who met her"". In her native Spain, her death made headlines and many came forward to express their sympathy. Spanish professional golfer Azahara MuÃ±oz posted a photo of the two together on Instagram, writing: ""Waking up to the news that Celia won't be around anymore is heartbreaking.""

"Artwork: The BFR spaceship will be able to carry humans on a trip around the Moon Elon Musk's company SpaceX has unveiled the first private passenger it plans to fly around the Moon. Japanese billionaire and online fashion tycoon Yusaku Maezawa, 42, announced: ""I choose to go to the Moon."" The mission is planned for 2023, and would be the first lunar journey by humans since 1972. But it is reliant on a rocket that has not been built yet, and Mr Musk cautioned: ""It's not 100% certain we can bring this to flight.""

The company said the flight on board the Big Falcon Rocket (BFR) - a launch system that was unveiled by Mr Musk in 2016 - represented ""an important step toward enabling access for everyday people who dream of travelling to space"". Earlier on Twitter, Mr Musk had already hintedthat the passenger would be from Japan.,external Mr Maezawa said he would invite up to eight artists to join him in space Mr Maezawa made headlines last year after paying $110.5m (Â£85.4m) for a painting by the late artist Jean-Michel Basquiat at an auction in New York. The art enthusiast said on Monday he would invite six to eight artists from around the world to join him on the trip. ""They will be asked to create something after they return to Earth. These masterpieces will inspire the dreamer within all of us,"" he told reporters. Only 24 humans have visited the Moon - all of them Americans; 12 of them landed on the moon. Nasa's Apollo 17 in December 1972 marked the last time humans landed on the moon, or went beyond low Earth orbit. Mr Maezawa will not land on the moon. He will travel on what is called a ""free return trajectory"", which will bring his BFR ship back to Earth after it has gone around the far side of the satellite. Allow Twitter content?

But in February this year, Mr Musk said SpaceX would concentrate on the BFR for future crewed missions. The BFR has never flown, but Mr Musk has released some technical details about it. The rocket is expected to stand 118m high and have a diameter of 9m.

On Monday, Mr Musk unveiled new artist impressions of the BFR and the spaceship which will carry passengers around the Moon. It appeared to confirm some design changes to the spaceship, including three large fins near the back and a black heat-shield on the craft's underside. Eventually, the BFR should be able to lift a whopping 150 tonnes into low-Earth orbit - that is more than the US Saturn V rockets that lofted the Apollo spacecraft.

"This video can not be played Drew Povey was in the TV series Educating Greater Manchester The head teacher of the school which featured in the TV series Educating Greater Manchester has resigned after claiming his suspension felt like a ""personal vendetta"". Drew Povey, head at Harrop Fold School in Little Hulton, Salford, was suspendedin July. The BBC understands the suspension relates to school record-keeping. Salford City Council denied the allegation that it was a personal vendetta against Mr Povey. Three other members of staff were suspended as part of the investigation. In a tweet,external, Mr Povey said he could no longer sit quietly under the ""threat"" of not being able to comment. He said he understood his suspension related to administrative errors involving a ""very small number of pupils"" about how attendance, exclusions and home schooling were recorded. Mr Povey said he took full responsibility for the errors, but did not believe they ""constitute grounds for me to be pursued in the way that I have been"". ""This feels very much like a personal vendetta and I hope that by removing myself from the situation, that some semblance of normality will return to the school, for the benefit of all,"" he said. He said the ""protracted"" investigation had created uncertainty and had had a ""detrimental impact"" on the school. Lisa Stone, the council's lead member for children's and young people's services, said she was disappointed that Mr Povey had made some details of the investigation public. ""In my experience governors do not launch investigations and suspend senior members of staff for mere administrative errors,"" she said. ""This is an in-depth and wide-ranging investigation into many serious allegations and it will continue in the interests of the school, pupils, parents and the members of staff who remain suspended. ""The governing body is trying to reach a conclusion as quickly as possible. ""It is in no-one's interests to rush through something so serious."" Hundreds of peoplehad signed a petitioncalling for Mr Povey to be reinstated. Some Twitter users have expressed their support for Mr Povey.

"Fed-up House of Fraser customers fear they will end up out of pocket as the company has gone silent about replacing the retailer's gift cards. When it was bought by Sports Direct, concerned customers were told to send in gift cards for ""a replacement"". But a month after the August deal, they have heard nothing and the chain is not responding to questions. Angry Cathy Martin told the BBC: ""They've stolen Â£150 from me - and thousands of others."" If the new owners fail to replace the cards, those who still had them when the department store chain went into administration will join a long queue of other creditors - meaning there will be little chance of getting their money back. House of Fraser customers refused refunds House of Fraser rescue details emerge Ashley makes House of Fraser store promise Sports Direct last weektook a hard lineon shoppers who ordered goods online but were not delivered before the chain was bought last month. They have been told not to expect a refund. The company's PR advisers have failed to respond to emails and phone calls from the BBC, leading to growing fears that they may take an equally hard line with gift cards or vouchers bought before the collapse of the chain in August. Adam French, consumer rights editor at Which? said: ""This is appalling. It's worrying that the House of Fraser has gone silent on this."" Cathy Martin ended up with a House of Fraser gift card in lieu of a refund last year and had not got round to using it by this summer. ""I took it to the Belfast store just after the announcement was made that the Chinese sale had failed and was told the gift cards were no longer being accepted,"" she said. She sent the card to an address provided by the store, but has heard nothing since. ""I honestly feel like going and lifting Â£150 worth of stock and walking out! I mean, it's the same thing, isn't it?; except I'd be arrested and House of Fraser gets away with  pretty much the same thing. They've stolen Â£150 from me - and thousands of others."" The gift card market has doubled in the past five years and is now estimated to be worth more than Â£6bn annually. But many people may have discovered that the card that friends and family have bought them for Christmas or a birthday are now worthless. That's because more retailers are going out of business, leaving gift card holders as creditors, which looks likely to happen to House of Fraser customers. ""When House of Fraser told people to send in their gift cards, we recommended they photocopy them and send them recorded delivery, with proof of postage, so they have some evidence,"" said Mr French of Which? ""Without that evidence they may have difficulty making a claim to the administrator."" You need to make a claim in writing to the administrator with proof of your vouchers or gift cards. Administrators EY said : ""Customers can submit a claim against theHF Stores Realisations Limited,external(formerly House of Fraser (Stores) Limited).  However, this will be treated as an unsecured creditor claim and unfortunately they will only receive a very modest recovery against the amount claimed."" Another route is to claim to a credit card provider, such as your bank, if the gift cards were bought using plastic. Section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act can make credit card providers jointly liable for breaches of contract with a trader when people buy on a credit card. To have a chance of a claim, gift cards need to be worth more than Â£100 and bought on a credit card.

"A report says there should be no limit on the number of high-skilled workers, such as doctors, coming to the UK to work The cap on the number of high-skilled migrants coming to the UK should be scrapped, according toa key report commissioned by the government ahead of Brexit,external. The Migration Advisory Committee says these workers make a more positive contribution to the public finances. It suggests EU workers should be subject to the same visa rules as other migrants. But it notes the UK might offer them special status under a Brexit deal. The government has said it will ""carefully consider"" the committee's proposals. How has EU migration changed the UK? Labour backed the report, calling for an ""end to discrimination"" against non-EU migrants. Under the current system, workers from the European Economic Area (EEA) - which includes all EU countries including the UK, as well as Norway, Iceland and Lichtenstein - enjoy freedom of movement, travelling and working within the area without visas. The committee recommends a policy allowing greater access for higher-skilled migration while restricting access for lower-skilled workers. It suggests extending the current scheme for high-skilled non-EEA migrants - known as a Tier 2 visa - to those from EEA countries as well. As part of this process, the cap on the total amount of workers allowed to enter under Tier 2 should be abolished and the range of jobs eligeable for the visas expanded, the committee says. Current policy is to allow 20,700 high-skilled workers into the UK each year on Tier 2 visas. The current salary threshold for such visas is Â£30,000, which the report says should be retained. Top priority is given to jobs on a ""shortage occupation list,external"". Examples include: Geophysicists Mining engineers 3D computer animators Games designers Cyber security experts Emergency medicine consultants Paediatric consultants With regard to low-skilled workers, the committee says it is ""not convinced there needs to be a work route for low-skilled workers"" from the EU to fill jobs in industries such as catering or hospitality. The ""possible exception"" to this rule could be for seasonal agriculture, where 99% of the workers come from EU countries. Reality Check: Who are the low-skilled EU workers? It also does not recommend that there should be exceptions for workers coming to the UK to work in the public sector. The committee - which is made up of independent experts, says it does not seen any ""compelling reasons to offer a different set of rules"" for workers from the EEA than those from other countries - unless such a position has been arrived at as part of the Brexit negotiations. ""A migrant's impact depends on factors such as their skills, employment, age and use of public services, and not fundamentally on their nationality,"" it says. Do we really know how many people come to the UK? Taking stock of where we are with Brexit Brexit: All you need to know The report goes on to say there is no evidence that increased European migration has damaged life in the UK. It concludes that EU migrants pay more in tax than they receive in benefits, contribute more to the NHS workforce than the healthcare they access, and have no effect on crime rates. It says the impact of all EEA migration to the UK since 2004 was almost certainly less than that of the fall in the value of the pound following the referendum vote. By Dominic Casciani, BBC home affairs correspondent The report says there should be no route to ensure low-skilled workers can come in from the EU Ministers commissioned this report because they needed clear facts on the role of European workers in the country - and the implications of ending their freedom of movement. But it's too soon to know how many of the committee's recommendations will be adopted because of the Brexit elephant in the room. So while the experts want no special immigration deal for future EU workers (the report does not concern those who are already living in the UK), it doesn't consider whether a special deal would be good or bad for Britain. Such a deal is a possibility. The prime minister's Chequers plan proposes a ""mobility framework"" - a system allowing British and EU citizens to study and work in each other countries, potentially linked to a trade deal. So if the ministers offer special access for future EU workers, in return for something they want for the UK, this report won't help us know whether it is worth it. The MAC was asked to do the research in July 2017 by then Home Secretary Amber Rudd. It is thought it could shape the government's post-Brexit immigration policy. BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith said Mrs May might start ""sketching out"" her plans for this at October's Conservative Party conference. He added that the report would increase pressure on her to not compromise on freedom of movement during the Brexit negotiations. Please upgrade your browser Stephen Clarke, senior economic analyst at the Resolution Foundation, said if the recommendations were adopted, it would signal ""the biggest change to the UK labour market in a generation"" and would represent a ""huge shift"" for sectors such as hotels and food manufacturing. He said: ""If enacted, these proposals would effectively end low-skilled migration, while prioritising mid- and high-skill migration in areas where we have labour shortages. The Royal College of Nursing welcomed the recommendations, saying the UK had long depended on recruiting nursing professionals from around the world. But Lord Green of Deddington, chairman of Migration Watch UK, said the report was ""blind to the impact"" of EU migration to a number of communities. He said the proposals would ""permit continued high levels of immigration"" and ""the overall outcome would be to weaken immigration control"". The government says it will listen to the report and bring in an immigration system that works for the whole of the UK, adding: ""EU citizens play an important and positive role in our economy and society and we want that to continue after we leave"". Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said the UK's immigration policy should be ""based on our economic needs, while meeting our legal obligations and treating people fairly"". ""[This] means ending the discrimination against non-EU migrants, especially from the Commonwealth,"" she added. But Yvette Cooper, Labour MP and chair of the Home Affairs Select Committee, said the report was ""puzzling"" with ""significant gaps"" between the MAC's research and recommendations. ""The MAC admit they have ignored the crucial relationship between immigration and trade,"" she said. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"The latest round of Trump tariffs effectively tax half of all Chinese goods exported to the US. President Donald Trump has slapped a third wave of tariffs on $200bn (Â£152bn) of Chinese goods. This means that almost half of all the products the US buys from China will have tariffs on them - equal to 40% of China's exports to the US.Almost half of the products on this list are consumer goods,external- things like suitcases, handbags and cutlery. This seriously raises the stakes. China has already said it will not take this lying down, and talks that were reportedly due to take place between both sides increasingly look like they will be shelved. Each time the Chinese thought they were close to a deal, they were effectively Trumped. US escalates trade war with fresh tariffs The early victims of Trump's trade war The US leader's tweet on Monday illustrates the value he sees in trade tariffs - simply as a bargaining chip. But it is a massive gamble - America has as much, if not more, to lose than the Chinese. The immediate impact of these tariffs is that prices for US consumers will most likely go up, Chinese exporters will probably suffer from lower orders, and both countries will see economic growth rates under pressure. This video can not be played What are tariffs and how do they affect us? I've been in China this week, and have seen for myself just how far apart these two countries' positions are. But I've also seen how intricately intertwined the countries are, and how dependent they have been on each other for growth. The problem is in part down to the each country's understanding of the other's motives - and that lack of understanding is the reason why neither side is willing to budge. Mr Trump says that China has stolen American technology, American jobs, and played a dirty game when it comes to restricting access to the Chinese market for US firms. And while others may not go quite so far, there is some truth to the notion that China hasn't been completely transparent in opening up its economy the way it committed to under the World Trade Organization, says William Zarit, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Beijing. ""A market can be open officially and yet there are still barriers,"" he told me. ""This has been a problem with China for basically the last 30 years."" Six ways China could retaliate in a trade war US-China trade row: What has happened so far? Mr Zarit added, however, that the US business community in China doesn't see tariffs as the best way to solve the structural differences between the two sides. He said the trade tensions have had already had an impact on the treatment American businesses get in China. ""Holding up certifications, extra inspections at a factory, looking very carefully at your tax records for the last five years, holding something in customs until it rots and then you can send it back to America"" he said, describing the sorts of things that American businesses can sometimes face in China. Still, others point to the fact that China is deeply misunderstood by the US - and that's the reason why the two have yet to come to any resolution on the trade war. China has more than three million students studying in the US, compared to the 15,000 or so Americans that are studying in China, Wang Huiyang, president of the Centre for China and Globalisation, told me in Beijing recently. The think tank advises the Chinese government on policy. This lack of people-to-people exchanges means China's story and its economic model isn't convincingly explained to the West. Mr Wang also noted how beneficial the US China relationship over the last 40 years has been for American firms. ""All the major US companies are in China,"" he told me. ""Some are even bigger here than they are in the US. You can't say that is not a success."" So which viewpoint is accurate? Well, the truth - as always - lies somewhere in between. China is changing and opening up - but the government here imposes an inordinate amount of control over how the economy is run. And while it's true in some sectors Chinese companies do operate on a level playing field, there are many parts of the Chinese economy that are still heavily protected. But the US has also benefited from the decades of low prices and record profits operating and manufacturing in China has afforded American consumers and companies. ""I think this trade friction is a wake up call on both sides to see how inseparable we are,"" says Mr Wang. ""It's like a husband and wife - you can quarrel but you cannot divorce."" But it's hard to see how this quarrel might end anytime soon. ""I don't see a way out in the near term,"" said Mr Zarit. ""I would like to see serious negotiations in which the Chinese will address market opening, reciprocal treatment and equivalency."" Given the diametrically opposing views Washington and Beijing have of their problems, this trade war is unlikely to get better before it gets worse - for them, or for any of us.

"Donald Trump campaigned for election on a promise to make trade fairer for the US, and his push to do so has him fighting with some of America's oldest trading partners. The US has been embroiled in a tit-for-tat trade battle on several fronts over the past few months. The one that's creating the most interest is the conflict with China, as the world's two largest economies wrangle for global influence. China has accused the US of launching the ""largest trade war in economic history."" Mr Trump has imposed taxes on imports from China, Mexico, Canada and the EU, to encourage consumers to buy American products. All of these countries have retaliated. The US president's hard line on trade, which also saw himwithdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade pact (TPP) last year, marks a striking change from the free trade policies that have governed the exchange of goods for decades. The US has imposed three rounds of tariffs on Chinese products this year, totalling $250bn worth of goods. The first two rounds placed 25% tariffs on $50bn worth of imports from China, and Beijing retaliated in kind. Washington delivered a sharp escalation in the trade conflict in September withanother set of tariffs, this time on Chinese goods worth $200bn. Those taxes will take effect from 24 September, starting at 10% and increasing to 25% from the start of next year unless the two countries agree a deal. Mr Trump has warned even more could be on the way. The US president said if China retaliates then Washington would impose fresh tariffs on $267bn worth of Chinese products. If Trump goes ahead with that round of import taxes, it would mean virtually all of China's exports to the US would be subject to duties. Mr Trump says he wants to stop the ""unfair transfers of American technology and intellectual property to China"" and protect jobs. Tariffs, in theory, will make US-made products cheaper than imported ones, so encourage consumers to buy American. The idea is they would boost local businesses and support the national economy. But many US companies and industry groups have testified to the US Trade Representative's Office that theirbusinesses are being harmed. China: Trade war victim or player? The early victims of Trump's trade war Six ways China could retaliate in a trade war The dispute dates back to January, whenthe US slapped controversial tariffs on imported washing machines and solar panels. That was considered Mr Trump's most significant trade move since his decision to pull the US out of the TPP and renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta). No. Earlier this year, theUS started charging levieson the imports of steel and aluminium from the European Union, Mexico and Canada. US businesses have to pay a 25% tax when they import steel from those places and a 10% levy to buy aluminium from them. But these tariffs led to retaliation. This video can not be played What are tariffs and how do they affect us? The European Unionimposed tariffs on â¬2.8bn worth of US goodsin June on products such as bourbon whiskey, motorcycles and orange juice. In June,Mexico announced new tariffs on US products,including whiskey, cheese, steel, bourbon, and pork. Canada imposedretaliatory tariffs on 16.6bn Canadian dollars-worth of US productson 1 July. Reality Check: Is Trump right about trade? The International Monetary Fund says an escalation of the tit-for-tat tariffs couldshave 0.5%off global growth by 2020. There are signs that the trade dispute is already affecting the Chinese and US economies. Morgan Stanley has said a full-blown escalation of the trade dispute could knock 0.81 percentage points off global gross domestic product. This scenario would involve the US slapping 25% tariffs on all goods from both China and the EU, and similar measures imposed in response. Among companies,  the car industry seems to have been the most affected so far.Major carmakers recently warnedthat changes to trade policies were hurting performance. Ford and General Motors have lowered profit forecasts for 2018, citing higher steel and aluminium prices caused by new US tariffs. There are also concerns that the trade war could hurt other aspects of US-China relations.Mr Trump recently accused China of manipulating its currency- a sign that the row could be spreading to foreign exchange markets. Smaller Asian countries further down thesupply chaincould also suffer. According to the Economist, 30% of the value of the goods China exports to America originates from third-party countries. Ultimately, China may not have as much firepower as the US to retaliate, given the US buys much more from China than it sells to them. This could mean it would find alternative ways to fight back such as making life difficult for American companies in China by increasing red-tape.

The mission is planned for 2023, and would be the first lunar journey by humans since 1972.

Earlier on Twitter, Mr Musk had already hintedthat the passenger would be from Japan.,external Mr Maezawa said he would invite up to eight artists to join him in space Mr Maezawa made headlines last year after paying $110.5m (Â£85.4m) for a painting by the late artist Jean-Michel Basquiat at an auction in New York. The art enthusiast said on Monday he would invite six to eight artists from around the world to join him on the trip. ""They will be asked to create something after they return to Earth. These masterpieces will inspire the dreamer within all of us,"" he told reporters. Only 24 humans have visited the Moon - all of them Americans; 12 of them landed on the moon. Nasa's Apollo 17 in December 1972 marked the last time humans landed on the moon, or went beyond low Earth orbit. Mr Maezawa will not land on the moon.

"Callum and his two uncles began magnet fishing two years ago Army bomb disposal teams are regularly being called out when magnet fishers have found artillery at the bottom of canals and river beds, the Ministry of Defence has told the BBC. In some cases, live ammunition - such as grenades - has been found. Magnet fishing - trawling for metal objects in the water - is a growing pastime, with many people doing it to clean up the waterways. But the Canal and Rivers Trust called it ""dangerous"". The Ministry of Defence told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme it advises the public ""that if they inadvertently disturb what they believe to be live ordnance, they contact their local police force as a matter of urgency"". Callum, 15, from Leicestershire - whose surname the BBC has chosen not to use - said he had found guns, safes and a live hand grenade in canals. ""It's very exciting, because you wonder what views you'll get,"" he says, referring to his YouTube channel. While the BBC filmed him and his two uncles, it took just 10 minutes before they found a knife in the canal. They also discovered scrap iron, which they gave to a scrap dealer. Some people choose to sell the scrap metal they find. Police were called immediately after the hand grenade was found Some magnet fishers have been praised for cleaning up the environment. Callum's uncle, James, originally took his nephew out to stop him playing video games. He defended what they were doing - including the cost to the taxpayer when bombs or other artillery are found and the authorities have to be called. ""The bombs are probably safer being out (of) the canal, and being in the hands of the bomb squad,"" he said. Magnet fishing for guns in the canal England rugby star James Haskell on why he loves magnet fishing But the Canal and Rivers Trust has warned people to be careful when removing objects that have been underwater for a long time, calling it ""dangerous"". Gillian Renshaw, from the trust, said it had seen a spike in reports of magnet fishing as it continued to grow in popularity on social media. Two men drowned while magnet fishing in Huddersfield, after being pulled into the water. The trust also points to a by-law that prohibits items being taken out of the public canals it owns, which can lead to a Â£25 fine - though that is thought to be rarely enforced. It is not a criminal offence to magnet fish on private land, with permission.

"This video can not be played Sir Vince Cable: ""Brexit... can and must be stopped."" ""Brexit is not inevitable - it can and it must be stopped,"" Sir Vince Cable has told his party's annual conference. The Lib Dem leader said 29 March next year - the date the UK is set to leave the EU - was ""only a maybe"". He claimed there was a growing realisation that Brexit will be ""costly and painful"", particularly in a no-deal scenario. And he urged Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn to get behind the cross-party campaign for another referendum. Mrs May has said there will not be another referendum ""under any circumstances"" and Mr Corbyn has said he would prefer a general election. It's my Brexit deal or no deal, May says Cable: Lib Dems will oppose Chequers plan EU could give UK more time - Clegg Sir Vince spoke for 45 minutes and received a standing ovation from the party faithful in the Brighton conference centre for what was a sombre, thoughtful address with few jokes. Some of the loudest cheers came when he said Jeremy Corbyn should resign as Labour leader if he does not agree to demands from his own MPs and party members for a referendum on the final Brexit deal at their party conference next week. ""If Jeremy Corbyn will not say 'I will support a People's Vote and I will fight Brexit', Labour members should wave him goodbye,"" said Sir Vince. ""He is currently letting down the many people in Labour's heartland who now see Brexit for what it is. It's a Tory project, pursued for Tory ends, of which working people will be the main victims.""

He was due to say that ""years of economic pain justified by the erotic spasm of leaving the European Union. Economic pain felt - of course - not by them by those least able to afford it.""

The Lib Dem leader took aim at what he described as Tory ""chancers"" like Michael Gove and Boris Johnson, who he said had only backed Brexit to further their own leadership ambitions. He said Mr Johnson was a ""real danger to Britain"", comparing him with US President Donald Trump. ""He doesn't just resemble Trump - large, loud and blonde - he behaves more like him by the day. ""Their cynical disregard for the truth, their treatment of women, and their inflammatory divisive language make Boris and Donald the 'terrible twins of the rabid right'."" It was Sir Vince's second leader's speech to conference Mr Gove, on the other hand, was the ""ideal man for a penalty shoot out - right to the last moment you never know which way he will go"". The Lib Dem leader, who has said he will step down when Brexit has been ""resolved or stopped"", has put the chances of another referendum at about ""30%"". But he is talking to anti-Brexit Labour and Conservative MPs about how to get a second referendum, possibly by tabling a new bill or an amendment to legislation already going through Parliament, with proposed referendum questions. I'm not the next Lib Dem leader - Miller Do Lib Dem members want a new party? Tax wealthy to tackle inequality - Cable He claimed Theresa May, who voted Remain in the 2016 EU referendum but has vowed to deliver on the will of the people, knows ""deep down"" that Brexit is a ""bad idea"" whose ""time has gone"". He urged her to show ""true leadership"" by admitting that staying in the EU will be better than any deal she can get in Brussels. ""Instead of kowtowing to her enemies in the Conservative Party, she could lead her party and the country by opening her mind to a 'People's Vote' on the final deal"", he said. Sir Vince's predecessor Tim Farron listens to the speech This video can not be played In full: Sir Vince Cable's full speech to 2018 Lib Dem conference The Lib Dem leader also used his speech to set out a vision of a ""liberal future"" for Britain after the ""Brexit nightmare"" has been stopped, vowing to ""restore a sense of fairness and opportunity to a country where both have been lost"". He set out plans, announced at the weekend, to set up a Â£100bn citizens' fund to spread the UK's wealth more evenly, paid for, in part, by abolishing inheritance tax and replacing it with a ""levy on large financial gifts received over a lifetime"". The Lib Dems would also increase taxes on the wealthy, tackle homelessness, solve the housing crisis and combat racism, while controlling immigration, he said, referring to his ""personal experience of racism"" in the late 1960s. ""My wife and children were being denounced as people whose very presence here would lead to rivers foaming with blood. And I was thrown out of the parental home,"" he told his party conference. Sir Vince also used his speech to set out plans to transform his party, which has 12 MPs and has languished in the opinion polls since being in coalition with the Tories, into a ""movement for moderates"" and open up its next leadership contest to non-MPs. He said the party was still ""very pale and very male"", adding: ""We must change that and keep growing.""

"The inquest is looking at whether Alexander Perepilichnyy died of natural causes or was unlawfully killed The government can keep secret the details of whether there were any links between British spies and a Russian businessman who died in mysterious circumstances, a coroner has ruled. Alexander Perepilichnyy, 44, collapsed in November 2012 when out jogging near his mansion in Surrey. An investigation by Surrey Police later found he died of natural causes. Critics of the police response say a full public inquiry is now needed to establish whether he was poisoned. The coroner at the inquest into his death, judge Nicholas Hilliard QC, upheld an application by Home Secretary Sajid Javid, who is refusing to publicly release documents from MI5 and MI6 relating to Mr Perepilichnyy for security reasons. Mr Perepilichnyy, a millionaire businessman, moved to the UK in 2009 and had been helping the Hermitage Capital hedge fund expose an alleged $230m (Â£176m) money-laundering scheme linked to Russian organised crime. He spent the night before his death in Paris, where a witness said he fallen ill at a sushi restaurant and was sick several times. Forensic tests later found no evidence of toxins in his system, although poisoning could not be completely ruled out. A camera phone photo taken at the scene shows a covered body in the road The coroner said he was ""mindful"" of heightened concern about the case following theattack on Sergei and Yulia Skripalin Salisbury. But he said he agreed with the home secretary that publicly releasing intelligence information would lead to ""a real risk of serious harm to national security"". Judge Hilliard, who has security clearance, was able to view the material in a secret, closed session and said it ""will afford me no assistance in resolving the central question in this inquest of how Mr Perepilichnyy died"". In June, a lawyer representing Mr Perepilichnyy's life insurers Legal and General argued that any information suggesting contact with British spies would be ""very powerful evidence indeed"" that he might have been in particular danger. Last yearan investigation by the Buzzfeed website,externalquoted what it said was a highly classified report on Russian state assassinations, compiled for US Congress, that asserted with ""high confidence"" that Mr Perepilichnyy was murdered in an action sanctioned by President Putin. The coroner said that BuzzFeed had refused to disclose the material on which its investigation was based, but he was now satisfied the suggestion raised in the report was incorrect. The BBC understands that BuzzFeed has spoken again to US intelligence sources and is standing by all aspects of its reporting. The chief executive of Hermitage Capital Management, Bill Browder, says that given the level of ""government intervention"" in the case, a full public inquiry is now needed into Mr Perepilichnyy's death. ""There [are] so many requests that we've made for further investigation which have not been approved that it would be much better if this was a public inquiry,"" he said. Earlier this month the government said police had completed a review of the Perepilichnyy case and 13 other deaths linked to Russia in the aftermath of the Salisbury attack. It concluded there was no need to reopen any investigation. Closing submissions in the inquest on Mr Perepilichnyy are now due to take place on Friday, 21 September at the Old Bailey.

"This video can not be played Man who shot planning boss in front of TV cameras has died A man who shot dead a planning officer in view of TV cameras to protect an illegally built bungalow has died in a care home a year after being freed. Albert Dryden gunned down Derwentside Council officer Harry Collinson in Butsfield, County Durham, in June 1991. He was convicted of murder and the attempted murder of a solicitor. Dryden was released from prison last year after suffering a stroke and died, aged 78, at the weekend. He was also convicted of wounding a police officer and BBC journalist Tony Belmont. Alex Watson, leader at the time of the since abolished Derwentside Council, was a lifelong friend of Dryden. Now an independent Durham County Councillor, he said the case was ""tragic"" especially as Dryden and Mr Collinson also knew each other well. Dryden was still building the bungalow on the day he started shooting He said: ""I'd known Albert all my life - he was well known in the area and was very private. ""He loved the countryside like Harry Collinson did. They had interests that they shared and it went on for years. ""Albert would come in and have a cup of tea with Harry and they would talk about the situation. ""But Harry was quite adamant that what Albert was doing (building the bungalow without permission) was wrong."" Dryden opened fire on Mr Collinson and a solicitor, Michael Dunstan, as they led a council operation to demolish the bungalow he had built on a smallholding down a country lane. When Mr Collinson, a 46-year-old divorced father of two, fell wounded into a ditch, Dryden hit him with two further shots. Mr Collinson's older brother, Roy, has dismissed claims Dryden had recently shown remorse for the murder. He said he had received four letters written by his brother's killer from his prison cell, but described them all as the ""ravings of a madman"". ""Not once did he show any remorse, culpability, or regret for what he had done,"" he said. ""He looked to blame everyone but himself. At one stage he even tried to blame the vehicles that were going to knock down his house, claiming they were not taxed or something ridiculous like that. ""I get so annoyed when people try to rewrite history, and look at things from a different angle. No excuses can be made for what Albert Dryden did."" Harry Collinson was shot twice more as he lay in a ditch When asked whether Dryden's death would bring any comfort to his family, Mr Collinson said: ""It's over, but what he has done is going to impact generations of this family to come. Good riddance to the man."" Mr Watson, who had visited Dryden a few weeks before his death, said: ""It was quite tragic - devastating for Harry's family because this was a killing that should never have happened. ""It should have been prevented - the media and the police were there. ""The police were well warned about the situation because Albert had this passion for collecting weapons."" Meet the 107-year-old who fought fires in the Blitz Cat brings home suspected bag of drugs TripAdvisor suspends reviews for tunnel During Dryden's trial at Newcastle Crown Court in April 1992, the former steelworker claimed he was mentally unwell and not responsible for his actions - a claim that was rejected by the jury.

"This video can not be played How North Korea welcomed the South Korean leader The leaders of North and South Korea are meeting in the North Korean capital for talks centred on the stalled denuclearisation negotiations. North Korea has embarked on an unprecedented series of meetings this year with both the South and the US. But talks with Washington have reached deadlock, with both sides so far agreeing only to very general goals. South Korea's president hopes to be a mediator between the two, as well as boosting the inter-Korean relationship. President Moon Jae-in and his wife Kim Jung-sook arrived in Pyongyang on Tuesday morning for the three-day visit. They were warmly welcomed from the plane by Mr Kim and his wife, Ri Sol-ju. North Koreans lined the streets to welcome Mr Moon to the capital Tens of thousands of North Koreans waved flowers and shouted unification slogans as the leaders rode in an open car through parts of Pyongyang. It's the first trip to the North Korean capital by a leader from the South in a decade. It is Mr Moon's third meeting with the North's Kim Jong-un since their historic summit at the border in April this year. The Korean War ended in 1953 with an armistice- but no formal peace treaty was signed. The two leaders are expected to talk about what practical steps to take to reduce the nuclear threat on the Korean peninsula, but the specifics are not known. Human rights issues are not on the table. This video can not be played Ham Eun-hyeock survived the Cheonan explosion: 'Why are we friendly to them?' For South Korea, there are two main goals: to further inter-Korean co-operation and rapprochement to act as a negotiator between Pyongyang and Washington on the issue of denuclearisation. When the two Korean leaders met for the first time back in April, the simple fact that they were meeting was itself a major step. This time, Mr Moon has to make real progress in persuading the North Koreans to make concrete steps to denuclearise, says BBC Seoul correspondent Laura Bicker. Otherwise, the flurry of inter-Korean summits and the much-hyped Singapore meeting between Mr Kim and President Trump this year will be seen as glossy photo ops, and the US leader may begin to lose patience, she adds. Read more from Laura: The leader caught between Trump and Kim North Korea's sidelined human rights crisis What does 'denuclearisation' mean?,external The April meeting resulted in a joint declaration to improve ties and scale down the nuclear threat. Since then, North and South Korea haveheld a reunion of families separated by Korea's division, and last weekset up a liaison officeat the border to allow direct communication 24/7. The Korean leaders and their wives greeted each other warmly on the tarmac in Pyongyang This week, it's thought they will look at steps towards further co-operation. Developing the economic relationship is expected to be a key theme, but one concrete outcome could also be a scaling-down of the military presence at their border, the heavily guarded Demilitarised Zone (DMZ). Kim Jong-un's faith in Trump 'unchanged' Six months' training for 10 minutes on parade In line with the focus on economic ties, executives from South Korea's big business conglomerates, or chaebols, will form a large part of the South's delegation. Samsung's de facto leader Jay Y Lee is one of several business tycoons travelling with Mr Moon Top personnel from tech and consumer goods giants Samsung and LG will join representatives from car-maker Hyundai and chemical and energy conglomerate SK Group. Why North Korea is in no hurry to please the US Imagine a North Korean family... The stories behind Korean family reunions Economic co-operation between North and South is nothing new. Aside from trade relations, South Korean firms once employed tens of thousands of North Korean workers in a jointly-run industrial park in the town of Kaesong, on the North's side of the border. This video can not be played Emotional reunion for mother and son The project ran for more than 10 years but was suspended in 2016 after North Korea carried out its fourth nuclear test. Seoul is also seeking to deploy its cultural power. K-pop singer Ailee, and Zico, the leader of boy band Block B, are set to perform in Pyongyang. Given the tight international sanctions on North Korea, any new economic co-operation between North and South will depend on an easing of sanctions on the North. This in turn will depend on the progress Pyongyang and Washington will make in their talks. The US and North Korea held their own historic meeting in June when US President Donald Trump and North Korea's Kim Jong-un agreed in broad terms to work towards denuclearisation. Since then though, there's been little progress with no clear process or timeline laid out. Most observers warn that the North has taken no meaningful steps to denuclearise. This video can not be played The nuclear word Trump and Kim can't agree on While the US wants denuclearisation first and an easing of sanctions second, North Korea hopes for a step-by-step process where each concession by Pyongyang will lead to a gradual easing of the sanctions regime. Given that deadlock,the US last month called off a trip by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to North Korea, citing a lack of progress. However, Mr Trump recently said that he and Mr Kim would ""prove everyone wrong"" after hereceived an invitation from the North Korean leader for a second summit. Both sides say they are working on making that meeting happen. In the run-up to Tuesday's inter-Korean talks, South Korean envoys reported thatMr Kim in fact wants to complete denuclearisation within the first term of the Trump administration.

"A report says there should be no limit on the number of high-skilled workers, such as doctors, coming to the UK to work The cap on the number of high-skilled migrants coming to the UK should be scrapped, according toa key report commissioned by the government ahead of Brexit,external. The Migration Advisory Committee says these workers make a more positive contribution to the public finances. It suggests EU workers should be subject to the same visa rules as other migrants. But it notes the UK might offer them special status under a Brexit deal. The government has said it will ""carefully consider"" the committee's proposals. How has EU migration changed the UK? Labour backed the report, calling for an ""end to discrimination"" against non-EU migrants. Under the current system, workers from the European Economic Area (EEA) - which includes all EU countries including the UK, as well as Norway, Iceland and Lichtenstein - enjoy freedom of movement, travelling and working within the area without visas. The committee recommends a policy allowing greater access for higher-skilled migration while restricting access for lower-skilled workers. It suggests extending the current scheme for high-skilled non-EEA migrants - known as a Tier 2 visa - to those from EEA countries as well. As part of this process, the cap on the total amount of workers allowed to enter under Tier 2 should be abolished and the range of jobs eligeable for the visas expanded, the committee says. Current policy is to allow 20,700 high-skilled workers into the UK each year on Tier 2 visas. The current salary threshold for such visas is Â£30,000, which the report says should be retained. Top priority is given to jobs on a ""shortage occupation list,external"". Examples include: Geophysicists Mining engineers 3D computer animators Games designers Cyber security experts Emergency medicine consultants Paediatric consultants With regard to low-skilled workers, the committee says it is ""not convinced there needs to be a work route for low-skilled workers"" from the EU to fill jobs in industries such as catering or hospitality. The ""possible exception"" to this rule could be for seasonal agriculture, where 99% of the workers come from EU countries. Reality Check: Who are the low-skilled EU workers? It also does not recommend that there should be exceptions for workers coming to the UK to work in the public sector. The committee - which is made up of independent experts, says it does not seen any ""compelling reasons to offer a different set of rules"" for workers from the EEA than those from other countries - unless such a position has been arrived at as part of the Brexit negotiations. ""A migrant's impact depends on factors such as their skills, employment, age and use of public services, and not fundamentally on their nationality,"" it says. Do we really know how many people come to the UK? Taking stock of where we are with Brexit Brexit: All you need to know The report goes on to say there is no evidence that increased European migration has damaged life in the UK. It concludes that EU migrants pay more in tax than they receive in benefits, contribute more to the NHS workforce than the healthcare they access, and have no effect on crime rates. It says the impact of all EEA migration to the UK since 2004 was almost certainly less than that of the fall in the value of the pound following the referendum vote. By Dominic Casciani, BBC home affairs correspondent The report says there should be no route to ensure low-skilled workers can come in from the EU Ministers commissioned this report because they needed clear facts on the role of European workers in the country - and the implications of ending their freedom of movement. But it's too soon to know how many of the committee's recommendations will be adopted because of the Brexit elephant in the room. So while the experts want no special immigration deal for future EU workers (the report does not concern those who are already living in the UK), it doesn't consider whether a special deal would be good or bad for Britain. Such a deal is a possibility. The prime minister's Chequers plan proposes a ""mobility framework"" - a system allowing British and EU citizens to study and work in each other countries, potentially linked to a trade deal. So if the ministers offer special access for future EU workers, in return for something they want for the UK, this report won't help us know whether it is worth it. The MAC was asked to do the research in July 2017 by then Home Secretary Amber Rudd. It is thought it could shape the government's post-Brexit immigration policy. BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith said Mrs May might start ""sketching out"" her plans for this at October's Conservative Party conference. He added that the report would increase pressure on her to not compromise on freedom of movement during the Brexit negotiations. Please upgrade your browser Stephen Clarke, senior economic analyst at the Resolution Foundation, said if the recommendations were adopted, it would signal ""the biggest change to the UK labour market in a generation"" and would represent a ""huge shift"" for sectors such as hotels and food manufacturing. He said: ""If enacted, these proposals would effectively end low-skilled migration, while prioritising mid- and high-skill migration in areas where we have labour shortages. The Royal College of Nursing welcomed the recommendations, saying the UK had long depended on recruiting nursing professionals from around the world. But Lord Green of Deddington, chairman of Migration Watch UK, said the report was ""blind to the impact"" of EU migration to a number of communities. He said the proposals would ""permit continued high levels of immigration"" and ""the overall outcome would be to weaken immigration control"". The government says it will listen to the report and bring in an immigration system that works for the whole of the UK, adding: ""EU citizens play an important and positive role in our economy and society and we want that to continue after we leave"". Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said the UK's immigration policy should be ""based on our economic needs, while meeting our legal obligations and treating people fairly"". ""[This] means ending the discrimination against non-EU migrants, especially from the Commonwealth,"" she added. But Yvette Cooper, Labour MP and chair of the Home Affairs Select Committee, said the report was ""puzzling"" with ""significant gaps"" between the MAC's research and recommendations. ""The MAC admit they have ignored the crucial relationship between immigration and trade,"" she said. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"This video can not be played The 70th annual Emmy awards did not disappoint Claire Foy, Thandie Newton and Charlie Brooker were among the British winners at the 70th Primetime Emmy Awards. Foy won the best actress in a drama series for her role as Queen Elizabeth II in Netflix's royal epic The Crown. Welsh actor Matthew Rhys also took home one of the night's big prizes - best leading actor in a drama series. Game of Thrones won two prizes - best drama series and supporting actor for Peter Dinklage - while The Marvelous Mrs Maisel scooped five comedy awards. However, two hotly-tipped shows - Atlanta and The Handmaid's Tale - failed to replicate their successes from last year and went home empty-handed. Elisabeth Moss had been the pre-show favourite to win best drama actress for the second season of The Handmaid's Tale, but lost out to Foy. The 8 best moments (and 1 that didn't happen) In pictures: The Emmys red carpet The ceremony's winners in full In her acceptance speech, the British star described her time on The Crown as ""the most extraordinary two-and-a-half years of my life"". She said: ""I was given a role I never thought I would ever get a chance to play, and I met people who I will love for ever and ever. ""And the show goes on, which makes me so proud. So I dedicate this to the next cast, the next generation, and I also dedicate this to [her co-star] Matt Smith."" Thandie Newton: ""I don't even believe in God but I'm going to thank her tonight"" Olivia Colman is due to take over the role from Foy as the show enters its third season. Stephen Daldry won best directing for a drama series for The Crown. Newton was awarded best supporting actress in a drama series for her role in Westworld. ""I don't even believe in God but I'm going to thank her tonight,"" the actress said as she took to the stage to collect her trophy. Rhys picked up best leading actor in a drama series for his role in The Americans. Set in suburban Washington DC shortly after Ronald Reagan is elected president, the series tells the story of two KGB spies in an arranged marriage who are posing as Americans. Matthew Rhys won best leading actor in a drama - one of the night's biggest prizes ""Parts like these come along so rarely. I will forever be in your debt,"" he told series creator Joe Weisberg in his speech.

This video can not be played Emmys proposal While accepting outstanding directing for a variety special for The Oscars, he spoke to his partner Jan Svendsen, who was sitting in the audience. ""You wonder why I don't like to call you my girlfriend? Because I want to call you my wife,"" he said as the crowd began cheering. Svendsen, who looked shocked and delighted, then made her way up to the stage to accept his proposal. Weiss said he was giving her the ring ""that my dad put on my mom's finger 67 years ago"". His proposal came just two weeks after the death of his mother, which he also referred to in his speech. Rhys joked about the moment later in the night, telling the audience as he collected his award that his girlfriend had whispered to him: ""If you propose to me I will punch you clean in the mouth.""

John Legend made an appearance in the opening musical number about Hollywood diversity - titled We Solved It Ceremony hosts Colin Jost and Michael Che then took to the stage - referencing the fact that streaming service Netflix received the most nods this year in their opening monologue. ""NBC has the most nominations of any broadcast network,"" Che said, adding: ""Which is kind of like being the sexiest person on life support"".

"Artwork: The BFR spaceship will be able to carry humans on a trip around the Moon Elon Musk's company SpaceX has unveiled the first private passenger it plans to fly around the Moon. Japanese billionaire and online fashion tycoon Yusaku Maezawa, 42, announced: ""I choose to go to the Moon."" The mission is planned for 2023, and would be the first lunar journey by humans since 1972. But it is reliant on a rocket that has not been built yet, and Mr Musk cautioned: ""It's not 100% certain we can bring this to flight."" The man hoping to become world's first moon tourist The announcement was made at SpaceX's headquarters in Hawthorne, California, on Tuesday. Allow Twitter content?

The company said the flight on board the Big Falcon Rocket (BFR) - a launch system that was unveiled by Mr Musk in 2016 - represented ""an important step toward enabling access for everyday people who dream of travelling to space"". Earlier on Twitter, Mr Musk had already hintedthat the passenger would be from Japan.,external Mr Maezawa said he would invite up to eight artists to join him in space Mr Maezawa made headlines last year after paying $110.5m (Â£85.4m) for a painting by the late artist Jean-Michel Basquiat at an auction in New York. The art enthusiast said on Monday he would invite six to eight artists from around the world to join him on the trip. ""They will be asked to create something after they return to Earth. These masterpieces will inspire the dreamer within all of us,"" he told reporters. Only 24 humans have visited the Moon - all of them Americans; 12 of them landed on the moon. Nasa's Apollo 17 in December 1972 marked the last time humans landed on the moon, or went beyond low Earth orbit. Mr Maezawa will not land on the moon. He will travel on what is called a ""free return trajectory"", which will bring his BFR ship back to Earth after it has gone around the far side of the satellite. Allow Twitter content?

At the time, SpaceX was to have used its heavy-lift Falcon Heavy rocket and the crewed version of the existing Dragon capsule. But in February this year, Mr Musk said SpaceX would concentrate on the BFR for future crewed missions. The BFR has never flown, but Mr Musk has released some technical details about it. The rocket is expected to stand 118m high and have a diameter of 9m. By comparison, the Falcon Heavy is 70m tall and consists of a central rocket core surrounded by two boosters, each with a diameter of 3.66m. Allow Twitter content?

On Monday, Mr Musk unveiled new artist impressions of the BFR and the spaceship which will carry passengers around the Moon. It appeared to confirm some design changes to the spaceship, including three large fins near the back and a black heat-shield on the craft's underside. Eventually, the BFR should be able to lift a whopping 150 tonnes into low-Earth orbit - that is more than the US Saturn V rockets that lofted the Apollo spacecraft. The SpaceX founder has attracted some uncomfortable headlines of late - he recentlysmoked marijuana during a webcastwith a US comedian. Shares in Tesla have had a turbulent time after the entrepreneur said in a tweet last month that he wanted to take the carmaker private. He abandoned the idea about two weeks later. Earlier on Monday it emergedMr Musk was being sued for defamation over his repeated claims that a British cave diver was a child abuser. The lawsuit brought by Vernon Unsworth, who helped with the rescue of 12 Thai teenagers from a flooded cave in July, seeks $75,000 (Â£57,000) in compensation and an injunction against Mr Musk to stop further allegations.

"A report says there should be no limit on the number of high-skilled workers, such as doctors, coming to the UK to work The cap on the number of high-skilled migrants coming to the UK should be scrapped, according toa key report commissioned by the government ahead of Brexit,external. The Migration Advisory Committee says these workers make a more positive contribution to the public finances. It suggests EU workers should be subject to the same visa rules as other migrants. But it notes the UK might offer them special status under a Brexit deal. The government has said it will ""carefully consider"" the committee's proposals. How has EU migration changed the UK? Labour backed the report, calling for an ""end to discrimination"" against non-EU migrants. Under the current system, workers from the European Economic Area (EEA) - which includes all EU countries including the UK, as well as Norway, Iceland and Lichtenstein - enjoy freedom of movement, travelling and working within the area without visas. The committee recommends a policy allowing greater access for higher-skilled migration while restricting access for lower-skilled workers. It suggests extending the current scheme for high-skilled non-EEA migrants - known as a Tier 2 visa - to those from EEA countries as well. As part of this process, the cap on the total amount of workers allowed to enter under Tier 2 should be abolished and the range of jobs eligeable for the visas expanded, the committee says. Current policy is to allow 20,700 high-skilled workers into the UK each year on Tier 2 visas. The current salary threshold for such visas is Â£30,000, which the report says should be retained. Top priority is given to jobs on a ""shortage occupation list,external"". Examples include: Geophysicists Mining engineers 3D computer animators Games designers Cyber security experts Emergency medicine consultants Paediatric consultants With regard to low-skilled workers, the committee says it is ""not convinced there needs to be a work route for low-skilled workers"" from the EU to fill jobs in industries such as catering or hospitality. The ""possible exception"" to this rule could be for seasonal agriculture, where 99% of the workers come from EU countries. Reality Check: Who are the low-skilled EU workers? It also does not recommend that there should be exceptions for workers coming to the UK to work in the public sector. The committee - which is made up of independent experts, says it does not seen any ""compelling reasons to offer a different set of rules"" for workers from the EEA than those from other countries - unless such a position has been arrived at as part of the Brexit negotiations. ""A migrant's impact depends on factors such as their skills, employment, age and use of public services, and not fundamentally on their nationality,"" it says. Do we really know how many people come to the UK? Taking stock of where we are with Brexit Brexit: All you need to know The report goes on to say there is no evidence that increased European migration has damaged life in the UK. It concludes that EU migrants pay more in tax than they receive in benefits, contribute more to the NHS workforce than the healthcare they access, and have no effect on crime rates. It says the impact of all EEA migration to the UK since 2004 was almost certainly less than that of the fall in the value of the pound following the referendum vote. By Dominic Casciani, BBC home affairs correspondent The report says there should be no route to ensure low-skilled workers can come in from the EU Ministers commissioned this report because they needed clear facts on the role of European workers in the country - and the implications of ending their freedom of movement. But it's too soon to know how many of the committee's recommendations will be adopted because of the Brexit elephant in the room. So while the experts want no special immigration deal for future EU workers (the report does not concern those who are already living in the UK), it doesn't consider whether a special deal would be good or bad for Britain. Such a deal is a possibility. The prime minister's Chequers plan proposes a ""mobility framework"" - a system allowing British and EU citizens to study and work in each other countries, potentially linked to a trade deal. So if the ministers offer special access for future EU workers, in return for something they want for the UK, this report won't help us know whether it is worth it. The MAC was asked to do the research in July 2017 by then Home Secretary Amber Rudd. It is thought it could shape the government's post-Brexit immigration policy. BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith said Mrs May might start ""sketching out"" her plans for this at October's Conservative Party conference. He added that the report would increase pressure on her to not compromise on freedom of movement during the Brexit negotiations. Please upgrade your browser Stephen Clarke, senior economic analyst at the Resolution Foundation, said if the recommendations were adopted, it would signal ""the biggest change to the UK labour market in a generation"" and would represent a ""huge shift"" for sectors such as hotels and food manufacturing. He said: ""If enacted, these proposals would effectively end low-skilled migration, while prioritising mid- and high-skill migration in areas where we have labour shortages. The Royal College of Nursing welcomed the recommendations, saying the UK had long depended on recruiting nursing professionals from around the world. But Lord Green of Deddington, chairman of Migration Watch UK, said the report was ""blind to the impact"" of EU migration to a number of communities. He said the proposals would ""permit continued high levels of immigration"" and ""the overall outcome would be to weaken immigration control"". The government says it will listen to the report and bring in an immigration system that works for the whole of the UK, adding: ""EU citizens play an important and positive role in our economy and society and we want that to continue after we leave"". Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said the UK's immigration policy should be ""based on our economic needs, while meeting our legal obligations and treating people fairly"". ""[This] means ending the discrimination against non-EU migrants, especially from the Commonwealth,"" she added. But Yvette Cooper, Labour MP and chair of the Home Affairs Select Committee, said the report was ""puzzling"" with ""significant gaps"" between the MAC's research and recommendations. ""The MAC admit they have ignored the crucial relationship between immigration and trade,"" she said. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Fed-up House of Fraser customers fear they will end up out of pocket as the company has gone silent about replacing the retailer's gift cards. When it was bought by Sports Direct, concerned customers were told to send in gift cards for ""a replacement"". But a month after the August deal, they have heard nothing and the chain is not responding to questions. Angry Cathy Martin told the BBC: ""They've stolen Â£150 from me - and thousands of others."" If the new owners fail to replace the cards, those who still had them when the department store chain went into administration will join a long queue of other creditors - meaning there will be little chance of getting their money back. House of Fraser customers refused refunds House of Fraser rescue details emerge Ashley makes House of Fraser store promise Sports Direct last weektook a hard lineon shoppers who ordered goods online but were not delivered before the chain was bought last month. They have been told not to expect a refund. The company's PR advisers have failed to respond to emails and phone calls from the BBC, leading to growing fears that they may take an equally hard line with gift cards or vouchers bought before the collapse of the chain in August. Adam French, consumer rights editor at Which? said: ""This is appalling. It's worrying that the House of Fraser has gone silent on this."" Cathy Martin ended up with a House of Fraser gift card in lieu of a refund last year and had not got round to using it by this summer. ""I took it to the Belfast store just after the announcement was made that the Chinese sale had failed and was told the gift cards were no longer being accepted,"" she said. She sent the card to an address provided by the store, but has heard nothing since. ""I honestly feel like going and lifting Â£150 worth of stock and walking out! I mean, it's the same thing, isn't it?; except I'd be arrested and House of Fraser gets away with  pretty much the same thing. They've stolen Â£150 from me - and thousands of others."" The gift card market has doubled in the past five years and is now estimated to be worth more than Â£6bn annually. But many people may have discovered that the card that friends and family have bought them for Christmas or a birthday are now worthless. That's because more retailers are going out of business, leaving gift card holders as creditors, which looks likely to happen to House of Fraser customers. ""When House of Fraser told people to send in their gift cards, we recommended they photocopy them and send them recorded delivery, with proof of postage, so they have some evidence,"" said Mr French of Which? ""Without that evidence they may have difficulty making a claim to the administrator."" You need to make a claim in writing to the administrator with proof of your vouchers or gift cards. Administrators EY said : ""Customers can submit a claim against theHF Stores Realisations Limited,external(formerly House of Fraser (Stores) Limited).  However, this will be treated as an unsecured creditor claim and unfortunately they will only receive a very modest recovery against the amount claimed."" Another route is to claim to a credit card provider, such as your bank, if the gift cards were bought using plastic. Section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act can make credit card providers jointly liable for breaches of contract with a trader when people buy on a credit card. To have a chance of a claim, gift cards need to be worth more than Â£100 and bought on a credit card. But with gift cards often bought by other people, it will mean contacting the giver to get them to chase the cash.

"This video can not be played How North Korea welcomed the South Korean leader The leaders of North and South Korea are meeting in the North Korean capital for talks centred on the stalled denuclearisation negotiations. North Korea has embarked on an unprecedented series of meetings this year with both the South and the US. But talks with Washington have reached deadlock, with both sides so far agreeing only to very general goals. South Korea's president hopes to be a mediator between the two, as well as boosting the inter-Korean relationship. President Moon Jae-in and his wife Kim Jung-sook arrived in Pyongyang on Tuesday morning for the three-day visit. They were warmly welcomed from the plane by Mr Kim and his wife, Ri Sol-ju. North Koreans lined the streets to welcome Mr Moon to the capital Tens of thousands of North Koreans waved flowers and shouted unification slogans as the leaders rode in an open car through parts of Pyongyang. It's the first trip to the North Korean capital by a leader from the South in a decade. It is Mr Moon's third meeting with the North's Kim Jong-un since their historic summit at the border in April this year. The Korean War ended in 1953 with an armistice- but no formal peace treaty was signed. The two leaders are expected to talk about what practical steps to take to reduce the nuclear threat on the Korean peninsula, but the specifics are not known. Human rights issues are not on the table. This video can not be played Ham Eun-hyeock survived the Cheonan explosion: 'Why are we friendly to them?' For South Korea, there are two main goals: to further inter-Korean co-operation and rapprochement to act as a negotiator between Pyongyang and Washington on the issue of denuclearisation. When the two Korean leaders met for the first time back in April, the simple fact that they were meeting was itself a major step. This time, Mr Moon has to make real progress in persuading the North Koreans to make concrete steps to denuclearise, says BBC Seoul correspondent Laura Bicker. Otherwise, the flurry of inter-Korean summits and the much-hyped Singapore meeting between Mr Kim and President Trump this year will be seen as glossy photo ops, and the US leader may begin to lose patience, she adds. Read more from Laura: The leader caught between Trump and Kim North Korea's sidelined human rights crisis What does 'denuclearisation' mean?,external The April meeting resulted in a joint declaration to improve ties and scale down the nuclear threat. Since then, North and South Korea haveheld a reunion of families separated by Korea's division, and last weekset up a liaison officeat the border to allow direct communication 24/7. The Korean leaders and their wives greeted each other warmly on the tarmac in Pyongyang This week, it's thought they will look at steps towards further co-operation. Developing the economic relationship is expected to be a key theme, but one concrete outcome could also be a scaling-down of the military presence at their border, the heavily guarded Demilitarised Zone (DMZ). Kim Jong-un's faith in Trump 'unchanged' Six months' training for 10 minutes on parade In line with the focus on economic ties, executives from South Korea's big business conglomerates, or chaebols, will form a large part of the South's delegation. Samsung's de facto leader Jay Y Lee is one of several business tycoons travelling with Mr Moon Top personnel from tech and consumer goods giants Samsung and LG will join representatives from car-maker Hyundai and chemical and energy conglomerate SK Group. Why North Korea is in no hurry to please the US Imagine a North Korean family... The stories behind Korean family reunions Economic co-operation between North and South is nothing new. Aside from trade relations, South Korean firms once employed tens of thousands of North Korean workers in a jointly-run industrial park in the town of Kaesong, on the North's side of the border. This video can not be played Emotional reunion for mother and son The project ran for more than 10 years but was suspended in 2016 after North Korea carried out its fourth nuclear test. Seoul is also seeking to deploy its cultural power. K-pop singer Ailee, and Zico, the leader of boy band Block B, are set to perform in Pyongyang. Given the tight international sanctions on North Korea, any new economic co-operation between North and South will depend on an easing of sanctions on the North. This in turn will depend on the progress Pyongyang and Washington will make in their talks. The US and North Korea held their own historic meeting in June when US President Donald Trump and North Korea's Kim Jong-un agreed in broad terms to work towards denuclearisation. Since then though, there's been little progress with no clear process or timeline laid out. Most observers warn that the North has taken no meaningful steps to denuclearise. This video can not be played The nuclear word Trump and Kim can't agree on While the US wants denuclearisation first and an easing of sanctions second, North Korea hopes for a step-by-step process where each concession by Pyongyang will lead to a gradual easing of the sanctions regime. Given that deadlock,the US last month called off a trip by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to North Korea, citing a lack of progress. However, Mr Trump recently said that he and Mr Kim would ""prove everyone wrong"" after hereceived an invitation from the North Korean leader for a second summit. Both sides say they are working on making that meeting happen. In the run-up to Tuesday's inter-Korean talks, South Korean envoys reported thatMr Kim in fact wants to complete denuclearisation within the first term of the Trump administration.

"The inquest is looking at whether Alexander Perepilichnyy died of natural causes or was unlawfully killed The government can keep secret the details of whether there were any links between British spies and a Russian businessman who died in mysterious circumstances, a coroner has ruled. Alexander Perepilichnyy, 44, collapsed in November 2012 when out jogging near his mansion in Surrey. An investigation by Surrey Police later found he died of natural causes. Critics of the police response say a full public inquiry is now needed to establish whether he was poisoned. The coroner at the inquest into his death, judge Nicholas Hilliard QC, upheld an application by Home Secretary Sajid Javid, who is refusing to publicly release documents from MI5 and MI6 relating to Mr Perepilichnyy for security reasons. Mr Perepilichnyy, a millionaire businessman, moved to the UK in 2009 and had been helping the Hermitage Capital hedge fund expose an alleged $230m (Â£176m) money-laundering scheme linked to Russian organised crime. He spent the night before his death in Paris, where a witness said he fallen ill at a sushi restaurant and was sick several times. Forensic tests later found no evidence of toxins in his system, although poisoning could not be completely ruled out. A camera phone photo taken at the scene shows a covered body in the road The coroner said he was ""mindful"" of heightened concern about the case following theattack on Sergei and Yulia Skripalin Salisbury. But he said he agreed with the home secretary that publicly releasing intelligence information would lead to ""a real risk of serious harm to national security"". Judge Hilliard, who has security clearance, was able to view the material in a secret, closed session and said it ""will afford me no assistance in resolving the central question in this inquest of how Mr Perepilichnyy died"". In June, a lawyer representing Mr Perepilichnyy's life insurers Legal and General argued that any information suggesting contact with British spies would be ""very powerful evidence indeed"" that he might have been in particular danger. Last yearan investigation by the Buzzfeed website,externalquoted what it said was a highly classified report on Russian state assassinations, compiled for US Congress, that asserted with ""high confidence"" that Mr Perepilichnyy was murdered in an action sanctioned by President Putin. The coroner said that BuzzFeed had refused to disclose the material on which its investigation was based, but he was now satisfied the suggestion raised in the report was incorrect. The BBC understands that BuzzFeed has spoken again to US intelligence sources and is standing by all aspects of its reporting. The chief executive of Hermitage Capital Management, Bill Browder, says that given the level of ""government intervention"" in the case, a full public inquiry is now needed into Mr Perepilichnyy's death. ""There [are] so many requests that we've made for further investigation which have not been approved that it would be much better if this was a public inquiry,"" he said. Earlier this month the government said police had completed a review of the Perepilichnyy case and 13 other deaths linked to Russia in the aftermath of the Salisbury attack. It concluded there was no need to reopen any investigation. Closing submissions in the inquest on Mr Perepilichnyy are now due to take place on Friday, 21 September at the Old Bailey.

"The Il-20 aircraft was returning to a Russian base on the north-western coast of Syria (file photo) Russia has said Syria shot down one of its military planes - but laid the blame for the deaths of the 15 personnel on board with Israel. The defence ministry said Israeli jets put the Il-20 plane into the path of Syrian air defence systems on Monday after failing to give Moscow enough warning of a strike on Syrian targets. The Il-20 disappeared off the radar at about 23:00 local time (20:00 GMT). The Israel Defence Force (IDF) has expressed ""sorrow"" over the deaths. A tour of Syria - with the Russian military Russia and Turkey to create Syria buffer zone However,in a statement released on Twitter,external, it added: ""Israel holds the [Syrian President Bashar al-]Assad regime, whose military shot down the Russian plane, fully responsible for this incident."" It went on to say its jets were back in Israeli airspace by the time the missiles were launched. Israel - which also blamed Iran and Hezbollah - rarely acknowledges carrying out strikes on Syria, but an Israeli military official recently said it had hit more than 200 Iranian targets in Syria over the past 18 months. The Israeli government is concerned by what it calls Iran's ""military entrenchment"" in Syria, as well as shipments of Iranian weapons to the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, which is fighting alongside Syrian government forces. The details are murky, and Russia's account of the incident has yet to be verified. Monday's incident is reported to have occurred about 35km (22 miles) from the Syrian coast as the Ilyushin Il-20 aircraft was returning to Russia's Hmeimim airbase near the north-western city of Latakia. Russia's Tass news agency says the Il-20 plane ""disappeared during an attack by four Israeli F-16 jets on Syrian facilities in Latakia province"". Reports on Syrian state media spoke of an attack in the area shortly before the plane disappeared. According to Sana news agency, the military said it had intercepted ""enemy missiles coming from the open sea towards the city of Latakia"". Syrian television also reported explosions over the sky in Latakia just before 22:00. Thirty minutes later, the Sana Facebook page reported that Syrian air defences had responded to enemy missiles. In a statement, Russia said Israel's ""irresponsible actions"" were to blame, saying it was given less than a minute's warning ahead of the strikes, which was not enough time to get the military surveillance plane out of the way. ""The Israeli planes deliberately created a dangerous situation for surface ships and aircraft in the area,"" a defence ministry spokesman said. The spokesman accused Israeli pilots of ""using the Russian airplane as a cover"", putting it ""in the line of fire coming from Syrian air defence systems"". Photos 'reveal' Russia jet damage at Hmeimim base Why is there a war in Syria? The plane, the spokesman continued, was shot down by a Syrian missile. ""As a result of the irresponsible actions by the Israeli military, 15 Russian servicemen have died,"" the spokesman said. It is not possible to verify any of these claims. The IDF said its jets were targeting Syrian military facilities ""from which systems to manufacture accurate and lethal weapons were about to be transferred on behalf of Iran to Hezbollah in Lebanon"". It added the Syrian anti-aircraft missiles were ""inaccurate"" and ""extensive"". What's more, it claimed its jets were back in Israeli airspace by the time the missiles were launched. The statement also accused the Syrian military of failing ""to ensure that no Russian planes were in the air"", adding it would share the relevant information with Moscow. In an earlier phone call on Tuesday, Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu told his Israeli counterpart Avigdor Lieberman the blame ""fully rests with Israel"", adding that Russia ""reservesÂ the right to take further steps in response"". Russia later summoned the Israeli ambassador to its foreign ministry. A search-and-rescue operation is under way. Analysis by Jonathan Marcus, BBC Defence Correspondent Russia's anger is real. But the question is, are the Russians attributing blame fairly? The charges are two-fold. Long-standing and up to now effective information-sharing broke down. The Israeli Air Force has Russian-speaking air traffic controllers able to communicate with their Russian opposite numbers. But Moscow says they were informed of the Israeli raid with only one minute's notice. Secondly Russia charges - more seriously - that the Israelis used the large radar signature of the Ilyushin turbo-prop to mask their own aircraft. But the radar signatures of the relatively slow Ilyushin and four nimble F-16 jets are radically different. Furthermore, the Syrian air defences should have known the Russian plane was in-bound, whatever the Israelis were doing. There may be several contributory factors in this tragedy. Russia cannot publicly castigate its Syrian allies. In private things may be rather different. Russia began military strikes in Syria in 2015 after a request from President Bashar al-Assad, who has stayed in power despite seven years of civil war which has so far killed more than 350,000 people. The Russian military said in April of this yearit had also spent 18 months helping to rebuild the air defence system,external, according to the UK's Guardian newspaper. Hmeimim is Russia's main base for air strikes on rebel groups in Syria - strikes that have enabled President Assad's forces to recover much lost ground since 2015. Russia says its air strikes only target ""terrorists"", but activists have said they mainly hit mainstream rebel fighters and civilians. According to The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group, at least 7,928 civilians and 10,069 combatants have been killed in Russian strikes. Russia has also suffered personnel losses, including the deaths of 39 people whena Russian military transport plane crashed as it attempted to landat Hmeimim in March.

"The â¬1bn European Space Agency mission is set to launch in February 2020 It's taken a little longer than expected but the Solar Orbiter probe is built and ready to begin testing. UK engineers are putting the finishing touches to the satellite this week before sending it to Germany to begin a year-long test campaign. Such attention to detail is necessary because of the punishing conditions the spacecraft will experience when studying our star's inner workings. SolO is going to fly to within 43 million km of the solar surface. In doing so, the heatshield on the front of the European Space Agency (Esa) satellite will have to cope with temperatures of up to 600C. If you're thinking, ""but I thought we just launched a probe to study the Sun"" - you'd be right. That was the US space agency's (Nasa) Parker satellite, which left Earth in August. The two missions actually have very similar goals - and on many occasions will be working hand in glove, trying to understand what drives our star's activity. Nasa gets lift-off in Sun mission 'Cheesegrater' radar launches to space Mercury mission ready for 'pizza oven' This video can not be played Tim Horbury: ""The poles of the Sun are really important"" Parker will do it by going even closer than SolO, to within 7 million km of the solar surface. This will allow the American probe to sit directly in and sample the Sun's outer atmosphere, or corona. This is the place where the ""solar wind"" - the storm of charged particles (plasma) and the magnetic fields they carry - get accelerated and blown out into space. Solar Orbiter, on the other hand, will stand back somewhat to provide the wider context for what Parker is sensing. Daniel MÃ¼ller is the Esa SolO project scientist: ""The overarching science question we're trying to tackle is about how the Sun creates this plasma bubble around it, and how solar activity changes in time and also changes this bubble we all live in."" SolO can make very similar measurements to Parker from its ""gentler"" vantage point. But, crucially, it will also be taking pictures. The Esa mission's heatshield has peepholes that give telescopes an opportunity to spy the Sun's broiling surface. Parker can't do this. If any telescope tried to look past its shield, the hardware would rapidly melt in temperatures that exceeded 1,000C. ""We go close enough with Solar Orbiter that we can co-locate with some surfaces of the Sun,"" explains Helen O'Brien, an instrument manager from Imperial College London. ""We'll get to hover over a section to see how it develops, plus how the atmosphere coming out of that region behaves as it goes past us in space."" The diffuse corona is only visible to us on Earth during a total solar eclipse And there's another aspect to SolO's mission which is very different to Parker. The European satellite is going to use a series of flybys of Venus to gravitationally manoeuvre itself into an inclined orbit so that it can look down on the Sun's poles. This would be a first - we've never had pictures of these regions. ""Although we can't see them, the poles are where the Sun's magnetic field is really important,"" says Imperial's Tim Horbury, a principal investigator on SolO. ""The Sun's magnetic field is central to its dynamics; the magnetic field drives all the activity on the Sun."" Solar Orbiter was due to launch this year along with Parker, but a number of technical set-backs mean the European probe won't now set off until February 2020. The delay is disappointing but it shouldn't harm the research. SolO and Parker are still expected to be able to conduct joint science for a number of years. And at the end of it all, scientists should have a much clearer idea of the underlying motors for the Sun's 11-year cycles of behaviour. That's important because the biggest outbursts from our star will rattle the Earth's magnetic field. In the process, communications may be disrupted, satellites in orbit around the planet can be knocked offline, and power grids will be vulnerable to electrical surges. Missions like SolO and Parker should improve the tools used for forecasting these kinds of disturbances. SolO's heatshield has peepholes for the telescopes to look through Solar Orbiter has been assembled by Airbus in Stevenage. There's satisfaction at the aerospace giant that the build phase of the project has come to a close. Engineers have had to work hard to keep SolO as clean as possible, ensuring there is nothing on the spacecraft that might introduce electrical or magnetic interference to the probe's 10 instruments - and to ward off dust. ""If you get dust on the telescopes' lenses and then expose them to the Sun, you'll effectively bake that dust on to their surfaces, and you'll lose science,"" says integration manager Michelle Sprake. ""We've had challenges and have had to come up with solutions."" The Stevenage team is currently boxing up the probe for shipment to the IABG company in Munich where it will be alternately baked and frozen (parts of the probe in shadow in space can go down to minus 180C) to demonstrate its readiness for thermal extremes. SolO will also be shaken, and ""shouted at"" by big loudspeakers. This will prove it can handle the violence of riding on top of a rocket. Assuming Solar Orbiter comes through these trials, the satellite will then be despatched to Florida where Nasa has booked an Atlas vehicle to hurl the mission towards the Sun.

"The US and China: poles apart? As a US-led trade war rages on, some companies are starting to feel the pain. The US has been embroiled in a tit-for-tat trade battle on several fronts over the past few months. The one that's creating the most interest is the one with China, as the world's two largest economies wrangle for global influence. Some say President Trump is trying to raise pressure on China ahead of key mid-term elections at home in November. In the latest move, China said on Friday that it would levynew tariffs on more than 5,200 US productsif the US goes ahead with its latestthreat to impose 25% tariffs on $200bn(Â£152bn) of Chinese goods. Six ways China could retaliate in a trade war How a US-China trade war could hurt us all US-China trade row: What has happened so far? Earlier this year, the US also started charging levies on the imports of steel and aluminium, including from the European Union, Mexico, and Canada.These countries have retaliated. Here are some of the main sectors finding themselves victims of the trade war so far. The car industry seems to have been the most affected so far, withthree major automakers recently warningthat changes to trade policies are hurting performance. Ford and General Motors lowered profit forecasts for 2018, citing higher steel and aluminium prices caused by new US tariffs. Fiat Chrysler also cut its 2018 revenue outlook after sales in China slumped, as buyers postponed purchases in anticipation of lower car tariffs. In May, China announced that it would cut tariffs on imported cars from 25% to 15% on 1 July in a move seen as an attempt to reduce trade tensions with the US. But shortly after, on 6 July, it increased tariffs on US-made cars to 40% in retaliation to the US's move to tax $34bn of Chinese products. Jaguar Land Rover, the UK's biggest car firm, also recently reported a lossfor the first time in three years after sales slowed down in China. Among the reasons, it said many consumers had delayed purchases due to a change in Chinese import duties. JLR has seen sales slow in China European and US car companies are also responding by increasing prices in China. BMW recently said it would raise prices on two of its models from 30 July due to the increased import duty on US-made cars in China. Tesla has also reportedlyincreased prices on two of its models,external. However, there has also been a positive impact for China, as Anna-Marie Baisden, head of autos research at Fitch Solutions, points out. ""We have seen a number of carmakers, including Tesla, accelerating plans to invest in local production facilities to avoid import tariffs,"" she says. Other firms in the broader industry are also considering their options. ""Ironically some of the hardest-hit companies are American or producing in the US, even though the tariffs imposed by the US are intended to help domestic companies,"" says Ms Baisden. US motorcyle makerHarley-Davidson plans to shift some production awayfrom the US to avoid the ""substantial"" burden of European Union tariffs, imposed in retaliation to US duties on steel and aluminium. Some companies in the food and drinks industry are also lowering their outlooks and putting up their prices to cope with the new status quo. Tyson Foods recently cut its profit forecast,saying retaliatory duties on US pork and beef exports had lowered US meat prices. US spirits and wine giant Brown-Forman has said it will increase the price of Jack Daniel's and other whiskeys in some European countries, according to media reports. Coca-Cola has also said it will increase prices,externalin North America this year to compensate for higher freight rates and metal prices, according to the Wall Street Journal. Coca-Cola is raising its prices in the US in response to higher costs Other companies are seeking to do less business with China,externalas a way of avoiding the tariffs. Toymaker Hasbro is moving more production out of China, US conglomerate Honeywell wants to use more supply chain sources from countries outside China and home furnishing company RH expects to cut the amount of goods sourced from China, according to Reuters. Meanwhile, US equipment maker Caterpillar recently said strong demand had allowed it to hike prices to offset $100m-$200m in higher steel and aluminium costs. The International Monetary Fund says an escalation of the tit-for-tat tariffscould shave 0.5% off global growth by 2020. Separate releases recently showed growth inChina's manufacturing sector slowing in July,externalandone measure of US consumer sentiment falling,externaldue to tariff concerns, according to media reports. Morgan Stanley estimates that a full-blown escalation of the trade dispute could knock 0.81 percentage points off global gross domestic product. This scenario would involve the US slapping 25% tariffs on all goods from both China and the EU, and them responding with similar measures. The bank said most of the effect from tariff hikes on growth would probably be seen only in 2019. Most of the impact - or almost 80% - would come through a disruption of domestic and international supply chains, the bank added.

"The US is threatening to escalate its trade war with China. It imposed tariffs on $34bn of Chinese goodson 6 July and only days laterlisted another $200bn of additional productsit intends to target. US President Donald Trump has said more than $500bn worth could be hit - almost the entire value of China's goods exports to the US last year. The US buys nearly four times as much from China as it sells to them.,externalGiven that China has limited room to retaliate through trade, it could seek other ways to get back at the US. US firms generate about $300bn of sales domestically in China so they are a potential target, says Julian Evans-Pritchard from Capital Economics. He highlights the likes of Apple, which have significant sales and operations there. He says China could make life difficult for US companies by slowing down customs clearance for their imports, delaying or denying visa applications, or using health and safety checks as a way of temporarily shutting down a firm's operations. There could also be more subtle measures. US companies may benefit less from Chinese efforts to open up its services sector (in areas such as finance and healthcare) than European and Japanese counterparts, says Julia Wang from HSBC. Gary Hufbauer of the Peterson Institute for International Economics (PIIE) in Washington reckons China ""will pick out US companies that are not well connected, and burden them with all kinds of regulatory red-tape"". But he says, ""this will hurt the Chinese economy, a lot"", as US companies contribute to China's economic growth. How a US-China trade war could hurt us all Charting the US-China trade battle US-China trade row: What has happened so far? Although the US has a big trade deficit with China, the US sells more services to China than it buys from them.Its services trade surplus with China hit $38bn in 2016.,external Part of that is overseas spending by tourists from China.More than 130 million people travelled out of China in 2016.,externalThose tourists, whose long-haul destinations included the US, spent around $260bn that year. So China could restrict tourism to the US. It wouldn't be the first time China has taken such an action.Last year it banned travel agencies from selling package tours to Korea last yearin protest at Seoul allowing a US missile defence system. However, some think this could be too disruptive. ""These measures will inflict pain on Chinese people,"" Mr Hufbauer says. Lowering the value of the yuan would help exports by making Chinese goods cheaper for other countries to import, and could offset the rise in prices caused by the US tariffs. Analysts say the fact China's central bank has not supported the currency during its recent fall shows they are leaving things to market forces for now. Given the yuan has fallen to a one-year low against the dollar, analysts also see little need for the central bank to intervene at this time. ""There is obviously some willingness to allow the currency to weaken to dampen the effect of the tariffs,"" Mr Evans-Pritchard says. ""I don't expect them to engineer a major devaluation of the currency."" China owns more than $1tn of US government bonds,external, which some worry gives Beijing influence over the US economy. But if China sold US bonds in bulk, it would hurt China. Why? Because that would reduce the value of an asset China holds a lot of, and it would have to switch to other, less liquid foreign bond markets. Also the impact on the US is likely to be limited, asUS debt sold by China is likely to be bought by other countries.,external ""We think this is very unlikely, as falling prices of US treasury securities would also be a loss for China,"" Nomura said in a research note. ""In addition, we believe it is very difficult for China to re-invest its US dollar holdings in a sensible way after selling US treasuries."" Mr Trump has suggested China may be interfering in US efforts to denuclearise North Korea. He recently tweeted he had confidence that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un would honour their agreement, but added: ""China, on the other hand, may be exerting negative pressure on a deal because of our posture on Chinese Trade-Hope Not!"".

PIIE recently wrote thatChina had ""formidable"" weapons in a trade war,externaland could use leverage in areas outside the economic sphere. ""This is a card China could easily play - just signal to the North Koreans to do what comes naturally - stall,"" PIIE's Mr Hufbauer says. ""The big drawback is that such action escalates the trade dispute into a geopolitical dispute of unknown magnitude."" China could focus on domestic growth, by making sure it has the tools to keep the economy growing during tougher times and by expanding its trade and investment relations with other countries. Mr Evans-Pritchard says China's ""best option"" in responding to tariffs is to be ready to prop up the economy.  He notes there are signs that earlier moves to slow credit growth and rein in debt levels are changing already. HSBC's Julia Wang says China will try to expand trade with countries other than the US. China recently hosted EU officials and discussed free trade. ""I think China has already been trying to diversify its trade and investment relationship away from the US since a few years ago, and now they will undoubtedly accelerate,"" she added.

"Mr Maassen works in the shadows - but now he is in the spotlight Germany's domestic intelligence chief, Hans-Georg Maassen, has been told to quit and move to a senior post at the interior ministry. The government decision came amid a row over Mr Maassen's response to far-right unrest in Chemnitz, eastern Germany. Anti-migrant ""hunts"" were reported there on 26 August after a German man was killed in a brawl with migrants. Mr Maassen doubted that foreign-looking people had been hounded. Chancellor Angela Merkel was urged to sack him. Critics said his scepticism downplayed the seriousness of far-right violence and intimidation in Chemnitz. Mr Maassen will leave the BfV spy service and become a state secretary in the interior ministry. German media report that he will actually move to a higher pay grade. It is not yet clear who will replace him. Several xenophobic assaults were reported in the eastern city after the fatal stabbing of Daniel Hillig. They were described as racist ""hunts"", and images emerged showing demonstrators chasing people and flinging bottles and fireworks. Controversially, spy chief Mr Maassen said hisFederal Office for Constitutional Protection (BfV),external- which is similar to the British MI5 - had ""no reliable information about such hunts taking place"" in Chemnitz. He also questioned whether a video posted by ""Antifa Zeckenbiss"" - meaning ""anti-fascist tick bite"" - really showed, as claimed, a ""hunt in Chemnitz"" on 26 August. Allow Twitter content?

German public broadcaster ARD said in a ""fact-check"",externalthat Antifa Zeckenbiss is an anonymous Twitter account, active since February, posting anti-fascist messages and ""there is nothing to indicate that it is a fake account"". There were more far-right rallies in Chemnitz after 26 August, and smaller counter-demonstrations by leftists. Mr Maassen was also criticised over his contacts with far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) politicians.

Tuesday's decision was a compromise between Mrs Merkel and her coalition partners - Interior Minister Horst Seehofer, of the right-wing Bavarian CSU, and centre-left Social Democrat (SPD) leader Andrea Nahles. Mr Seehofer defended Mr Maassen's actions over Chemnitz, but Ms Nahles wanted him dismissed. AfD's Beatrix von Storch tweeted scornfully:,external""This gives the SPD what it wanted in theory, Seehofer can remain spineless and Merkel gets some peace."" Investigations over the murder of Daniel Hillig are ongoing. Earlier on Tuesday, an Iraqi man identified as Yousif A was released from custody, three weeks after he was arrested and detained over the killing. His lawyer Ulrich Dost-Roxin said the detention had been ""illegal"", and accused officials and politicians of using him for political ends. ""No witness accused my client of involvement in the crime,""he said in a statement.,external A far-right crowd in central Chemnitz on 27 August - further rallies were held recently A Syrian man is still in custody, and police are still looking for a third suspect. The Maassen controversy has fuelled fears that Germany's main state security body may be soft on far-right extremism. AfD is now the main opposition party, with 92 seats in the 709-seat Bundestag. It backs the far-right protests, arguing that violent asylum-seekers should be expelled from Germany. AfD is furious with Mrs Merkel for having let in more than a million migrants in 2015-2016. Mr Maassen's predecessor was forced to quit over BfV shortcomings in the notorious NSU neo-Nazi case, in whicha terrorist cell killed 10 peoplein a racially-motivated campaign in 2000-2007. The BfV and police were found to have neglected or ignored racism as a motive. It has about 3,100 staff who, along with regional intelligence services, monitor groups acting against Germany's democratic order. It was created in 1950 by the Allied powers in Germany to guard against communist and pro-Nazi groups. It is part of the federal interior ministry and is overseen by the Bundestag. The BfV cannot make arrests. It says most of its intelligence is gathered from open or public sources, including press reports. It can only spy on groups - not private individuals - engaged in anti-constitutional behaviour. Separate BfV departments spy on radical left-wingers, far-right extremists and militant Islamists. The BfV also runs counter-espionage operations, watching foreign spies in Germany. But overseas intelligence-gathering is done by the BND spy service.

"Four major US tech companies have written to the US Trade Representative (USTR) asking for protection from the proposed third round of Trump tariffs. Dell, Cisco, Juniper Networks and Hewlett Packard Enterprise warn the new taxes could result in US job losses. The firms are worried the tariffs will increase their costs since many of their components come from China. They say a duty of between 10-25% ""would cause broad, disproportionate economic harm to US interests"". The last-ditch effort came as US public hearings on the upcoming tariffs ended. The hearings examining the potential impact of the taxes wrapped up on Thursday, setting expectations that another round of tariffs could be imposed on $200bn (Â£154.7bn) of Chinese products as early as Friday. Typically, however, the US has implemented tariffs within weeks, not days, of the end of public consultations. The four tech firms are concerned that tariffs will increase the cost of items such as hard drives, servers and networking equipment, which could hit profits and result in job cuts in the US. ""Over time the reduced profits that the duties could cause could lead to hiring freezes, stagnant wages, and even job losses, as well as harm to investors such as reduced dividends and erosion of shareholder value,"" the companies wrote in the letter to the USTR, Robert Lighthizer. Bikes, cots and fridges: the imports hit by Trump's tariffs US-China trade row: What has happened so far? The early victims of Trump's trade war They warned that an additional duty of up to 25% ""would cause broad, disproportionate economic harm to US interests"", including reduced spending on research and development and a slow down in innovations such as cloud computing and the rollout of 5G networks in the US. The impact could be wide-ranging since the four firms make equipment commonly used by other tech companies, the government, and institutions such as schools and hospitals. President Trump's trade war with China moved up a gear last month when theUS brought in a 25% tax on a second wave of goods worth $16bn. Tariffs had already been imposed on $34bn of Chinese goods in July. China has retaliated on both occasions with tariffs on the equivalent value of US goods. In an interview with the BBC's Asia Business Report programme, HPE's chief executive Antonio Neri said the firm had ""weathered the impact of the first two rounds of tariffs very well because it has a flexible and large scale supply chain"". While the firm stressed it was confident it would be able to make changes necessary to mitigate any impact of the tariffs, an HPE spokesperson said: ""Changes to a tariff system that has worked well for decades is not the way to go for our country."" 8 goods to be hit by Trump's tariffs New US-China tariffs heat up trade war 'Our voices will drown amongst the giants' Six ways China could retaliate in a trade war New fire erupts in Hollywood Hills and threatens landmarks as chaos grips LA Paris Hilton among stars 'heartbroken' as she watches home 'burn to ground' Commuters warned of icy roads as cold snap continues to freeze UK Sound Of 2025: Ezra Collective are 'keeping music real' The Papers: 'Apocalypse' LA and 'Reeves faces extra tax rises' How Australia's beach cabana drama sparked a turf war H-1B: Visa row under Trump fuels anxiety for Indian dreamers 'I thought I was going to die': Jailed Venezuelan activist details brutality of prison life The man who could become Canada's future PM 'Trump 2.0' looms large over the global economy A politician was shot dead in Bangkok.

"Donald Trump campaigned for election on a promise to make trade fairer for the US, and his push to do so has him fighting with some of America's oldest trading partners. The US has been embroiled in a tit-for-tat trade battle on several fronts over the past few months. The one that's creating the most interest is the conflict with China, as the world's two largest economies wrangle for global influence. China has accused the US of launching the ""largest trade war in economic history."" Mr Trump has imposed taxes on imports from China, Mexico, Canada and the EU, to encourage consumers to buy American products. All of these countries have retaliated. The US president's hard line on trade, which also saw himwithdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade pact (TPP) last year, marks a striking change from the free trade policies that have governed the exchange of goods for decades. The US has imposed three rounds of tariffs on Chinese products this year, totalling $250bn worth of goods. The first two rounds placed 25% tariffs on $50bn worth of imports from China, and Beijing retaliated in kind. Washington delivered a sharp escalation in the trade conflict in September withanother set of tariffs, this time on Chinese goods worth $200bn. Those taxes will take effect from 24 September, starting at 10% and increasing to 25% from the start of next year unless the two countries agree a deal. Mr Trump has warned even more could be on the way. The US president said if China retaliates then Washington would impose fresh tariffs on $267bn worth of Chinese products. If Trump goes ahead with that round of import taxes, it would mean virtually all of China's exports to the US would be subject to duties. Mr Trump says he wants to stop the ""unfair transfers of American technology and intellectual property to China"" and protect jobs. Tariffs, in theory, will make US-made products cheaper than imported ones, so encourage consumers to buy American. The idea is they would boost local businesses and support the national economy. But many US companies and industry groups have testified to the US Trade Representative's Office that theirbusinesses are being harmed. China: Trade war victim or player? The early victims of Trump's trade war Six ways China could retaliate in a trade war The dispute dates back to January, whenthe US slapped controversial tariffs on imported washing machines and solar panels. That was considered Mr Trump's most significant trade move since his decision to pull the US out of the TPP and renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta). No. Earlier this year, theUS started charging levieson the imports of steel and aluminium from the European Union, Mexico and Canada. US businesses have to pay a 25% tax when they import steel from those places and a 10% levy to buy aluminium from them. But these tariffs led to retaliation. This video can not be played What are tariffs and how do they affect us? The European Unionimposed tariffs on â¬2.8bn worth of US goodsin June on products such as bourbon whiskey, motorcycles and orange juice. In June,Mexico announced new tariffs on US products,including whiskey, cheese, steel, bourbon, and pork. Canada imposedretaliatory tariffs on 16.6bn Canadian dollars-worth of US productson 1 July. Reality Check: Is Trump right about trade? The International Monetary Fund says an escalation of the tit-for-tat tariffs couldshave 0.5%off global growth by 2020. There are signs that the trade dispute is already affecting the Chinese and US economies. Morgan Stanley has said a full-blown escalation of the trade dispute could knock 0.81 percentage points off global gross domestic product. This scenario would involve the US slapping 25% tariffs on all goods from both China and the EU, and similar measures imposed in response. Among companies,  the car industry seems to have been the most affected so far.Major carmakers recently warnedthat changes to trade policies were hurting performance. Ford and General Motors have lowered profit forecasts for 2018, citing higher steel and aluminium prices caused by new US tariffs. There are also concerns that the trade war could hurt other aspects of US-China relations.Mr Trump recently accused China of manipulating its currency- a sign that the row could be spreading to foreign exchange markets. Smaller Asian countries further down thesupply chaincould also suffer. According to the Economist, 30% of the value of the goods China exports to America originates from third-party countries. Ultimately, China may not have as much firepower as the US to retaliate, given the US buys much more from China than it sells to them. This could mean it would find alternative ways to fight back such as making life difficult for American companies in China by increasing red-tape.

"US company AMSC had its wind turbine software stolen by its one-time Chinese partner Sinovel Windpower Dan McGahn says it was a case of attempted murder. The victim was his business American Superconductor (AMSC), and the perpetrator was a Chinese company called Sinovel Windpower. The two firms had been partners, but Sinovel bribed an insider to steal AMSC's key wind turbine technology. As a result Massachusetts-based AMSC saw its sales collapse, its market value plummet by $1bn (Â£770m), and it had to lay off hundreds of employees. ""It was attempted corporate homicide,"" says Mr McGahn. This act of industrial espionage was uncovered back in 2011, and after a seven-year legal fight,a US judge last month fined Sinovel just $1.5m, the maximum currently possible.,external While Sinovel is also continuing to pay AMSC an agreed settlement of $57.5m, the US firm is getting back just a fraction of the losses it endured. Dan McGahn, boss of AMSC, urges US firms to be cautious when doing business in China The case of AMSC is perhaps exactly what President Trump has in mind when he rages against Chinese industrial espionage. At the start of last month the US government introduced tariffs on $34bn worth of Chinese exports, saying they were a result of China's ""unfair trade practices"", which included stealing US intellectual property. A few days later the White House warned that the tariffs could be extended to $200bn worth of Chinese products. Then three weeks agoTrump threatened to put tariffs on all $500bn worth of annual Chinese exports to the US. Will such a blanket tactic get Chinese firms to stop carrying out acts of industrial espionage, or should the US switch to a more targeted approach? Firstly though, exactly how did Sinovel bribe an AMSC worker? More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade: The country built on trade barriers The precious metal sparking a new gold rush The deepening China-Israel trade ties How the US is waging its trade war with China Australia's mega-mines When AMSC's wind power division first went into partnership with Sinovel back in 2007, it was applauded for its global ambition and business nous at a time when countries around the world were rushing to build more and more wind farms. AMSC knew that tying up with a Chinese firm came with risks, so it used all kinds of strategies to limit this, such as encrypting the software codes or ""brains"" that operated its turbines. Yet without warning, in 2011 Sinovel said it didn't need any more shipments of the turbine technology it had been buying from AMSC. Despite the American firm's best efforts to defend its secrets, Sinovel had bribed an AMSC employee, a Serbian national employed at its office in Austria, to hand over the key software. The man in question - Dejan Karabasevic - had been offered money, a job, an apartment, a whole new life in China. Hewas found guilty by a court in Austria in 2011,external. President Trump has been vocal in his attacks on Chinese business and trading practices AMSC's case is far from unique, and US firms in sectors from metals to microchips, and telecoms and transport have complained about Chinese rivals stealing their technology. Even US biscuit stable Oreo cookies faced a Chinese copycat. The situation is said to be so bad that the Commission on the Theft of American Intellectual Property, an independent US body including representatives from the public and private sectors, estimatesthat $600bn worth of US intellectual property is stolen every year,external, led by China. Mr McGahn points out that the rules on foreign investment in China - such as the need to partner with a Chinese company - make it difficult for even the most careful overseas companies to protect their trade secrets. He says the whole system for investing in China is set up for local firms to win. Just a few months into Mr Trump's presidency, experts convened at the White House - technical specialists, policy wonks, cabinet members and academics - to discuss how to tackle the problem. Following a seven-month investigation a White House report accused Beijing of ""state-led, market-distorting forced technology transfers"". The wind turbine sector has seen business soar over the past decade as countries around the world have rushed to build wind farms The Chinese government always says it is doing its best to prevent infringement of intellectual property, and in 2015 it pledged to clean up those firms not playing by the rules. But Derek Scissors, China expert at the American Enterprise Institute think tank, says China has long been a ""technology leech"". In his view Beijing stands squarely behind the Chinese firms committing the thefts. ""The idea that these firms are engaging in mass industrial espionage without the blessing of the Chinese government is not the slightest bit believable,"" says Mr Scissors, who was one of the experts who advised the White House on the issue. ""The Chinese monitor everything."" Other observers suggest that it is a more subtle process. Mara Hvistendahl, a fellow of the New America think tank and author of a forthcoming book on industrial espionage, says that Beijing simply ""looks the other way when companies steal in order to deliver [technological breakthroughs]"". An increasing amount of industrial espionage is said to be done by remote hacking of computers Both agree though that prosecuting spies who are caught red-handed is no longer enough. It is the equivalent of arresting drug-mules, rather than the masterminds, when tackling the illegal drug trade, Ms Hvistendahl says. Moreover, espionage is increasingly taking place in cyberspace, allowing perpetrators to remain thousands of miles beyond the reach of law enforcers. Skilful hackers may not even leave a trace of their break in. The other obstacle to successful legal prosecutions is a lack of plaintiffs willing to face the exposure, points out Professor Mark Button, director of the Centre for Counter Fraud Studies at Portsmouth University in the UK. ""Imagine a big pharma company has a wonder drug; if that information is lost to a competitor that can have big financial implications,"" he says. ""It can be embarrassing and it can have implications for the share price."" For that reason Prof Button speculates that the lack of high profile cases in Europe in recent years, probably disguises a hidden iceberg of incidents below the surface. The only really effective counterespionage strategy may be better defence at the company-level, he suggests. But Prof Button has some sympathy with Mr Trump's massive tariffs approach in confronting China over their practices, in precipitating ""a showdown"" over the problem. The Chinese government has always denied orchestrating industrial espionage Derek Scissors is much more sceptical: ""The solution we've come up with is completely misguided."" He says blanket tariffs fail to distinguish between firms that have benefited from espionage and those that have not. ""You have to punish the guilty or you don't get a change of behaviour,"" he says. Instead he'd like to see sanctions targeted against specific firms - ones that are clearly reproducing American technology that they haven't developed themselves. He believes that would be more effective than ""the quick fix"" chosen by the administration. But targeting and punishing individual companies is a tough road to travel as AMSC's experience shows. While AMSC continues to rebuild its business, Sinovel is continuing to thrive.

"The US and China: poles apart? As a US-led trade war rages on, some companies are starting to feel the pain. The US has been embroiled in a tit-for-tat trade battle on several fronts over the past few months. The one that's creating the most interest is the one with China, as the world's two largest economies wrangle for global influence. Some say President Trump is trying to raise pressure on China ahead of key mid-term elections at home in November. In the latest move, China said on Friday that it would levynew tariffs on more than 5,200 US productsif the US goes ahead with its latestthreat to impose 25% tariffs on $200bn(Â£152bn) of Chinese goods. Six ways China could retaliate in a trade war How a US-China trade war could hurt us all US-China trade row: What has happened so far? Earlier this year, the US also started charging levies on the imports of steel and aluminium, including from the European Union, Mexico, and Canada.These countries have retaliated. Here are some of the main sectors finding themselves victims of the trade war so far. The car industry seems to have been the most affected so far, withthree major automakers recently warningthat changes to trade policies are hurting performance. Ford and General Motors lowered profit forecasts for 2018, citing higher steel and aluminium prices caused by new US tariffs. Fiat Chrysler also cut its 2018 revenue outlook after sales in China slumped, as buyers postponed purchases in anticipation of lower car tariffs. In May, China announced that it would cut tariffs on imported cars from 25% to 15% on 1 July in a move seen as an attempt to reduce trade tensions with the US. But shortly after, on 6 July, it increased tariffs on US-made cars to 40% in retaliation to the US's move to tax $34bn of Chinese products. Jaguar Land Rover, the UK's biggest car firm, also recently reported a lossfor the first time in three years after sales slowed down in China. Among the reasons, it said many consumers had delayed purchases due to a change in Chinese import duties. JLR has seen sales slow in China European and US car companies are also responding by increasing prices in China. BMW recently said it would raise prices on two of its models from 30 July due to the increased import duty on US-made cars in China. Tesla has also reportedlyincreased prices on two of its models,external. However, there has also been a positive impact for China, as Anna-Marie Baisden, head of autos research at Fitch Solutions, points out. ""We have seen a number of carmakers, including Tesla, accelerating plans to invest in local production facilities to avoid import tariffs,"" she says. Other firms in the broader industry are also considering their options. ""Ironically some of the hardest-hit companies are American or producing in the US, even though the tariffs imposed by the US are intended to help domestic companies,"" says Ms Baisden. US motorcyle makerHarley-Davidson plans to shift some production awayfrom the US to avoid the ""substantial"" burden of European Union tariffs, imposed in retaliation to US duties on steel and aluminium. Some companies in the food and drinks industry are also lowering their outlooks and putting up their prices to cope with the new status quo. Tyson Foods recently cut its profit forecast,saying retaliatory duties on US pork and beef exports had lowered US meat prices. US spirits and wine giant Brown-Forman has said it will increase the price of Jack Daniel's and other whiskeys in some European countries, according to media reports. Coca-Cola has also said it will increase prices,externalin North America this year to compensate for higher freight rates and metal prices, according to the Wall Street Journal. Coca-Cola is raising its prices in the US in response to higher costs Other companies are seeking to do less business with China,externalas a way of avoiding the tariffs. Toymaker Hasbro is moving more production out of China, US conglomerate Honeywell wants to use more supply chain sources from countries outside China and home furnishing company RH expects to cut the amount of goods sourced from China, according to Reuters. Meanwhile, US equipment maker Caterpillar recently said strong demand had allowed it to hike prices to offset $100m-$200m in higher steel and aluminium costs. The International Monetary Fund says an escalation of the tit-for-tat tariffscould shave 0.5% off global growth by 2020. Separate releases recently showed growth inChina's manufacturing sector slowing in July,externalandone measure of US consumer sentiment falling,externaldue to tariff concerns, according to media reports. Morgan Stanley estimates that a full-blown escalation of the trade dispute could knock 0.81 percentage points off global gross domestic product. This scenario would involve the US slapping 25% tariffs on all goods from both China and the EU, and them responding with similar measures. The bank said most of the effect from tariff hikes on growth would probably be seen only in 2019. Most of the impact - or almost 80% - would come through a disruption of domestic and international supply chains, the bank added.

"The US is threatening to escalate its trade war with China. It imposed tariffs on $34bn of Chinese goodson 6 July and only days laterlisted another $200bn of additional productsit intends to target. US President Donald Trump has said more than $500bn worth could be hit - almost the entire value of China's goods exports to the US last year. The US buys nearly four times as much from China as it sells to them.,externalGiven that China has limited room to retaliate through trade, it could seek other ways to get back at the US. US firms generate about $300bn of sales domestically in China so they are a potential target, says Julian Evans-Pritchard from Capital Economics. He highlights the likes of Apple, which have significant sales and operations there. He says China could make life difficult for US companies by slowing down customs clearance for their imports, delaying or denying visa applications, or using health and safety checks as a way of temporarily shutting down a firm's operations. There could also be more subtle measures. US companies may benefit less from Chinese efforts to open up its services sector (in areas such as finance and healthcare) than European and Japanese counterparts, says Julia Wang from HSBC. Gary Hufbauer of the Peterson Institute for International Economics (PIIE) in Washington reckons China ""will pick out US companies that are not well connected, and burden them with all kinds of regulatory red-tape"". But he says, ""this will hurt the Chinese economy, a lot"", as US companies contribute to China's economic growth. How a US-China trade war could hurt us all Charting the US-China trade battle US-China trade row: What has happened so far? Although the US has a big trade deficit with China, the US sells more services to China than it buys from them.Its services trade surplus with China hit $38bn in 2016.,external Part of that is overseas spending by tourists from China.More than 130 million people travelled out of China in 2016.,externalThose tourists, whose long-haul destinations included the US, spent around $260bn that year. So China could restrict tourism to the US. It wouldn't be the first time China has taken such an action.Last year it banned travel agencies from selling package tours to Korea last yearin protest at Seoul allowing a US missile defence system. However, some think this could be too disruptive. ""These measures will inflict pain on Chinese people,"" Mr Hufbauer says. Lowering the value of the yuan would help exports by making Chinese goods cheaper for other countries to import, and could offset the rise in prices caused by the US tariffs. Analysts say the fact China's central bank has not supported the currency during its recent fall shows they are leaving things to market forces for now. Given the yuan has fallen to a one-year low against the dollar, analysts also see little need for the central bank to intervene at this time. ""There is obviously some willingness to allow the currency to weaken to dampen the effect of the tariffs,"" Mr Evans-Pritchard says. ""I don't expect them to engineer a major devaluation of the currency."" China owns more than $1tn of US government bonds,external, which some worry gives Beijing influence over the US economy. But if China sold US bonds in bulk, it would hurt China. Why? Because that would reduce the value of an asset China holds a lot of, and it would have to switch to other, less liquid foreign bond markets. Also the impact on the US is likely to be limited, asUS debt sold by China is likely to be bought by other countries.,external ""We think this is very unlikely, as falling prices of US treasury securities would also be a loss for China,"" Nomura said in a research note. ""In addition, we believe it is very difficult for China to re-invest its US dollar holdings in a sensible way after selling US treasuries."" Mr Trump has suggested China may be interfering in US efforts to denuclearise North Korea. He recently tweeted he had confidence that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un would honour their agreement, but added: ""China, on the other hand, may be exerting negative pressure on a deal because of our posture on Chinese Trade-Hope Not!"".

PIIE recently wrote thatChina had ""formidable"" weapons in a trade war,externaland could use leverage in areas outside the economic sphere. ""This is a card China could easily play - just signal to the North Koreans to do what comes naturally - stall,"" PIIE's Mr Hufbauer says. ""The big drawback is that such action escalates the trade dispute into a geopolitical dispute of unknown magnitude."" China could focus on domestic growth, by making sure it has the tools to keep the economy growing during tougher times and by expanding its trade and investment relations with other countries. Mr Evans-Pritchard says China's ""best option"" in responding to tariffs is to be ready to prop up the economy.  He notes there are signs that earlier moves to slow credit growth and rein in debt levels are changing already. HSBC's Julia Wang says China will try to expand trade with countries other than the US. China recently hosted EU officials and discussed free trade. ""I think China has already been trying to diversify its trade and investment relationship away from the US since a few years ago, and now they will undoubtedly accelerate,"" she added.

"China has hit back at President Donald Trump by announcing new trade tariffs on $60bn of US goods. It comes after the US slapped duties on $200bn of Chinese imports to take effect from next Monday, escalating its trade war with Beijing. China will target goods such as liquefied natural gas, produced in states loyal to the US president. However, in a tweet, Mr Trump warned Beijing against seeking to influence the upcoming US midterm elections. ""There will be great and fast economic retaliation against China if our farmers, ranchers and/or industrial workers are targeted!"" he said. Earlier he had suggested that this would mean further US tariffs on another $267bn worth of Chinese products. Such a move would mean roughly all of China's exports to the US would be subject to new duties. The Chinese commerce ministry said it would impose its tariffs from 24 September - the date the US duties come into effect - but at lower rates than previously expected. It will place an additional 5% in duty on US products including smaller aircraft, computers and textiles, and an extra 10% on goods such as chemicals, meat, wheat and wine. By contrast, the US duties will apply to almost 6,000 items, making them the biggest round of trade tariffs yet from Washington. They will affect handbags, rice and textiles, although some items such as smart watches and high chairs have been exempted. They will start at 10% and increase to 25% from the start of next year unless the two countries agree a deal. China and trade: Playing dirty or misunderstood victim? Trade wars, tariffs and protectionism explained The early victims of Trump's trade war Trade row: What has happened so far? Six ways China could retaliate in a trade war On Monday Mr Trump said the latest round of tariffs was in response to China's ""unfair trade practices"". ""We have been very clear about the type of changes that need to be made, and we have given China every opportunity to treat us more fairly. But, so far, China has been unwilling to change its practices,"" he said. Yes. In fact, the latest round of US duties marks the third set of tariffs put into motion so far this year. In July, the White House increased charges on $34bn worth of Chinese products. Then last month, the escalating trade war moved up a gear whenthe US brought in a 25% tax on a second wave of goods worth $16bn. This latest round means that about half of all Chinese imports to the US are now subject to the new duties. Unlike the earlier rounds, the list also targets consumer goods such as luggage and furniture. That means households may start to feel the impact from higher prices. US companies have already said they are worried about the effect of higher costs on their businesses and warned of the risk of job cuts. Trump tariffs will hurt global growth, IMF warns Will Trump's tariffs stop Chinese espionage? Many everyday items such as suitcases, handbags, toilet paper and wool are included in this latest round of tariffs. The list also includes food items,externalfrom frozen cuts of meat, to almost all types of fish, soybeans, various types of fruit and cereal and rice. The Apple Watch is one of the items to escape the tariffs The list of Chinese products slated for tariffs originally included more than 6,000 items, but US officials later removed about 300 types of items, including smart watches, bicycle helmets, play pens, high chairs and baby car seats. The changes come after fierce opposition from US companies including Apple and Dell, which fear the tariffs will increase their costs as many of their products are made in China. Earlier this month, Apple wrote to US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer warning that consumers would have to pay more for its products as a result of the proposed tariffs. At the time, Mr Trump replied with a tweet urging Apple: ""Make your products in the United States instead of China."" US tech firms ask for protection from next Trump tariffs This video can not be played Why the US-China trade war will hit most of our pockets The White House says its tariffs are a response to China's ""unfair"" trade policies. The import charges will make Chinese-made products more expensive - a move intended to convince US businesses and consumers to buy elsewhere. US officials hope the risk to the Chinese economy willconvince Beijing to change its policies. But many US businesses are critical of the tariffs with farmers, manufacturers, retailers and other industry groups calling them taxes on American families. Before its latest round of tariffs, China had previously imposed duties on $50bn of US products in retaliation, targeting key parts of the president's political base, such as farmers. The aim is to put pressure on businesses in states that supported Donald Trump in the 2016 US presidential election. The European Union has also used the tactic in its trade skirmishes with the US. Not really. Talks between high-level officials ended in May without resolving the matter and efforts to restart discussions have failed. US and China officials had discussed a new round of talks over the past week, but Mr Trump's latest move is likely to sour relations further. Andrew Walker, BBC economics correspondent The immediate objective of President Trump's action against China is to address what he calls the theft of American companies' technology, but it also plays into his wider concern about the US trade deficit. He sees it as something that needs to be corrected and as the result of bad trade agreements and unfair trading by other countries. The trouble is that a trade deficit is generally regarded as being the result of savings and investment decisions rather than trade policy. A country that spends more than it earns has a trade deficit. President Trump's other policies include tax cuts that could increase government borrowing, which is equivalent to cutting national saving and could create a bigger trade deficit. What Mr Trump hopes is that the tax cuts will boost economic activity so much that they will generate more revenue - and ""pay for themselves"". That's another area of economic controversy.

"Last December, Christine Lagarde was in a more positive mood. Globally, economies were growing at a ""reasonable"" pace. Recent progress on the Brexit negotiations between the UK and the rest of the European Union were ""welcome"". Both sides had just agreed the outline of the withdrawal agreement and divorce bill. Nine months on and todaya much bleaker assessment from the International Monetary Fund (IMF)and its managing director. The challenges on Brexit were ""daunting"", the IMF said. A ""no deal"" would have a significant and negative shock effect on the UK economy. And any Brexit deal, Chequers or otherwise, was also likely to mean a smaller economy in the future. There was still no solution to the Ireland border question. An economic ""Brexit dividend' - relied on by Theresa May to pay for at least some of the extra funding promised for the NHS - was unlikely to arrive quickly enough. Brexit: Where has the process got to? Brexit: All you need to know Yes, exports had been boosted by the fall in the value of sterling after the referendum, but not by enough to offset other negative effects. And such was the level of uncertainty around the Brexit process there was even a warning for the Bank of England on interest rates. ""Further withdrawal of monetary stimulus should await clear confirmation of a durable rise in domestic cost pressures,"" the IMF said. Which, in plainer language, means don't increase interest rates until it is crystal clear that inflation - prices - are going up too strongly for the economy to cope. The IMF says the challenges of Brexit are ""daunting"" Before Ms Lagarde made her speech this morning, Philip Hammond made a short statement. ""We must heed the warnings of the IMF about not reaching a deal,"" he said. The chancellor is clear. His political colleagues, he believes, need to focus on the economic effects of a ""no deal"" as outlined today by the IMF. And not flirt with the idea that, somehow, it might not have the negative economic effects outlined today. ""No-one voted to be poorer,"" he said last year. The Treasury believes the IMF's analysis is correct. A ""no deal"" would carry significant economic costs. IMF says no-deal Brexit will hit UK economy It's my Brexit deal or no deal, May says Taking stock of where we are with Brexit What happens now that a deal's been done?

"The Bank of England has left interest rates on hold at 0.75% as expected but flagged ""greater uncertainty"" around the Brexit negotiations. The Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted 9-0 to leave rates unchanged. A quarter of a percentage point rise last monthtook rates to the highest level since March 2009. The European Central Bank also kept eurozone interest rates unchanged at 0% on Thursday. The MPC said in the minutes of its September meeting there were mounting fears about the UK leaving with the EU without a deal agreed. ""Since the committee's previous meeting, there had been indications, most prominently in financial markets, of greater uncertainty about future developments in the withdrawal process,"" it said. The Bank's regional staff reported that businesses were cracking down on costs and holding back on investment ahead of Brexit. UK wages rise faster than expected World Cup and hot weather boost UK growth However, it raised the forecast for UK economic growth in the third quarter from 0.4% to 0.5%, partly due to stronger consumer spending over the unusually warm summer. The MPC flagged heightened risks to global growth following trade tensions between the US and China and turbulence in some emerging markets. Sterling was flat at $1.3051 and â¬1.1221 after the decision was announced. England basked in record temperatures this summer, which boosted consumer spending The minutes showed recent rises in economic and wages growth had not affected the MPC's commitment to ""gradual"" and ""limited"" rate rises in the coming years, said Samuel Tombs at Pantheon Macroeconomics. Ruth Gregory at Capital Economics said expected two rate rises next year and another two in 2020, bringing rates to 1.75%, assuming a Brexit deal was struck and the economy held up well. ""That would be above the market expectation for just two hikes over the next three years - but still consistent with the MPC's guidance,"" she said. Ben Brettell at Hargreaves Lansdown said: ""Policymakers are firmly in 'wait-and-see' mode having raised rates last month, and will be reluctant to even consider another move until they have a clear idea of what Brexit will look like. ""Realistically May next year looks the first available opportunity to raise rates to 1%."" Last month the Bank signalled that rates would need to rise by about 0.25 percentage points over the next two or three years to bring inflation, which stands at 2.5%, back to target. September's MPC minutes also revealed that the recent energy price cap announced by Ofgem would reduce inflation by more than expected over the course of 2019.
