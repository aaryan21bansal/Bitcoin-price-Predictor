"Thousands of flights have been cancelled worldwide as airlines struggle to cope with a slump in demand caused by the coronavirus outbreak. Ryanair will stop services to and from Italy from Friday until 8 April, with BA scrapping its routes until 4 April as the country goes into lockdown. EasyJet has cancelled all of its flights to and from Italy between 10 March and 3 April. It has said it will operate ""rescue flights"" in the coming days. Norwegian Air has also said it will cut about 3,000 flights in the next three months, about 15% of its capacity. It also plans to temporarily lay off ""a significant share"" of its workforce. ""We have initiated formal consultations with our unions regarding temporary layoffs for flying crew members as well as employees on the ground and in the offices,"" said chief executive Jacob Schram. While the restrictions on travel to Italy and China have meant some services have stopped completely, there has also been a general fall in demand as holiday-makers put their plans on hold and firms instruct staff to limit travel. British Airways: All of its Italy routes are cancelled until 4 April EasyJet: In the process of cancelling all of its Italy flights between 10 March and 3 April Ryanair: Scrapped all Italy flights from this Friday until 8 April Norwegian Air: Will cut 15% of its global schedule for a month American Airlines: Cutting 7.5% of its domestic flights in April Behind the scenes, the government is talking to airlines to make sure that there are enough routes operating from Italy so that British nationals who need to get home can do so. So Ryanair is not suspending all of its Italy flights until this Friday. Anyone with a flight after then can rebook to an earlier flight this week. A handful of EasyJet ""rescue flights"" in the coming days will also be designed to get people back to Britain, and to allow essential travel to Italy. So far there is no talk of an official repatriation programme, but a co-ordinated response is under way to try and ensure that no-one is left stranded. If you're concerned about your flight, the usual advice applies: check with your airline. Someairlines had continued to operate near-empty flightsin order to protect their rights to take-off and landing slots. Under EU ""use it or lose it"" rules they were required to run services on busy routes or forfeit them to other operators. However, European Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen has announced that airlines will be allowed to keep their slots even if they are not flying routes. ""This is a temporary measure, and this temporary measure helps both our industry, but it also helps our environment,"" she said. ""It will relieve the pressure on the aviation industry and in particular, on smaller airline companies. But it will also decrease emissions by avoiding so-called ghost flights.""

Australia's Qantas is reducing international flights by nearly 25% Australia's Qantas airline has said it will reduce international flights by nearly 25% as it sees demand fall from passengers worried about coronavirus. Qantas and its budget airline Jetstar will reduce operations for the next six months. ACI Europe, which represents European airports, said its ""initial assessment"" was that passenger numbers between January and March would drop 14% due to the coronavirus. ""The Covid-19 epidemic is turning into a shock of unprecedented proportions for our industry,"" said director general Olivier Jankovec. Aviation consultant John Strickland said how hard an airline will be hit depends on two things: ""Firstly, its exposure to affected markets such as China or Italy."" ""Secondly, as we saw with Flybe, some airlines, particularly smaller ones, can bleed through money quite quickly. Although they've cancelled flights, they aren't making up those revenues because of falling customer demand."" Mr Strickland added that governments ""often give warm words"" about the aviation industry, but said ""now is the time to act"".

"Railways will be among the infrastructure to see a boost in funding after Wednesday's budget The government will promise to raise infrastructure spending to its highest in decades in Wednesday's Budget. It will pledge to triple the average net investment made over the last 40 years into rail and road, affordable housing, broadband and research. The Treasury told the BBC it would lead to the ""highest levels [of investment] in real terms since 1955"" - more than Â£600bn over the five-year Parliament.

"Joe Biden has won Mississippi, Missouri and Michigan, CBS projects These victories mean he tightens his grip on the Democratic race for the White House Democrats are choosing a candidate to run against Republican Donald Trump in November Bernie Sanders is his only challenger but his path to the nomination is narrowing But some of the best states for Sanders lie ahead tonight Idaho and Washington stop voting at 23:00 ET (03:00 GMT) Votes are still being counted in N Dakota Tom Geoghegan, Paulin Kola, Holly Honderich and Ben Bevington We're winding down our coverage of the Democratic presidential primaries. Joe Biden claimed victory in Michigan, Mississippi and Missouri - vaulting the former vice-president further ahead of rival Bernie Sanders. It's not yet clear who will win the remaining states - North Dakota, Washington and Idaho. What is clear is that Joe Biden now has tightened his grip on victory. Now that polls have closed. we're looking to see which of the two leading candidates - Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders - have won each of the six states that voted today. But the number that really matters is thedelegate count. The primaries and caucuses are all about winning delegates - party members from a state who pledge to endorse a candidate at the party conventions in July. The number of delegates varies from state to state. The target for any candidate is to reach an unbeatable majority of1,990 delegates. As of now - and this will change as results trickle in - Joe Biden boasts813 delegates, a sturdy lead over Bernie Sander's656. Need a little background? Looking for some context? Here are some great explainers: BIG PICTURE:All you need to know about presidential race SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the primaries and caucuses? ISSUES:See how Biden and Sanders compare to Clinton, Obama and LBJ TURNOUT:Why don't more young people vote? BIDEN:Five areas where he's vulnerable SANDERS:Do his spending plans add up?  The US is facing an outbreak of coronavirus across the country, and two states voting today have been affected. One confirmed case has been reported inMissouriandWashingtonhas the highest number of reported cases - 270 - of any US state. But the show (election) must go on. As that AOC speech shows, no-one in the Democratic race has been able to harness youth support like Sanders. The BBC's Anthony Zurcher writes: Once
again, he performed best with ages 17 to 29,
according to exit polls. He carried it 82-15 in Michigan and 76-19 in Missouri,
and only lost it by 4% in Mississippi, despite being routed in the state. The
problem for the Vermont senator, however, was that the age group averaged only
12.5% of the electorate in those three states - not nearly enough to save the
day for Sanders. The epitaph for his campaign may be that it was premised, in
part, on the passion of new young voters who simply did not show up in
sufficient numbers at the polling booths. While
this may be good news in the short term for Biden, it is a flashing warning
sign for the general election if he is the nominee. Young voters were a key
part of the coalition that delivered the White House to Barack Obama in 2008,
as he won them by a record 34% over John McCain. If the former vice-president
does not find some way to improve his standing with this age demographic, he
may suffer the same fate as Hillary Clinton, who only won the youth vote by
18%. Read more: Why don't more young people vote?  New York Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez - progressive darling and Bernie Sanders' star surrogate - took to Instagram Live this evening as tonight's results looked increasingly dim for her candidate. ""There's no sugar coating it,"" she said to the nearly 10,000 users watching. ""Tonight's a tough night for the movement overall."" Describing a ""stark"" generational divide"" - younger voters for Sanders, older voters for Biden - Ocasio-Cortez told followers it was time to ""leverage"" support for Sanders and his policies, like Medicare for All. âNow is the time to ask for
accountability. And now is the time to ask for commitments - real commitments - not just gestures.â The final polls of the night - Idaho and Washington - have closed. Votes are still being counted in North Dakota. It is still too early to call the results for any of these three contests. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter On a
cool Tuesday evening at the University of South Florida campus in Tampa,
Florida, Bernie Sanders supporters gathered to plan and give themselves a pep
talk for the final week before the stateâs primary. A young
campaign worker told the crowd of students that the establishment - Democratic
rivals, the media and big corporations - were organising against their
candidate. But while they couldnât control what happened on Super Tuesday last
week or in Michigan, Washington and other states tonight, they are the ones
that get to decide whether Sanders wins in Florida and in their town and their
precincts. After another rought night tonight, his back will be to the wall,
and heâll need a good result in Florida, as well as other big states holding
primaries next week, such as Illinois and Ohio. Maria
Zamora and Sharman Hashmi, who attended the event, say they are still
optimistic about Sandersâ chances. âSanders
really stands behind the people who havenât had a voice for a long time,â
Zamora, who is on staff at the university, says. ""I feel like those people
are going to support him no matter what."" In the midst of another promising night - compounding his already commanding lead - Joe Biden thanked supporters and celebrated his political comeback. Just a week ago, pundits declared this campaign dead, he said. ""Now we're very much alive. ""It's a comeback for the soul of this nation. ""I take nothing for granted, I want to earn every single vote in every single state."" Earlier we brought you their healthcare and education differences. The third and final policy to explore is the one many believe to be the most important of all - climate change. They both believe cimate change is real, and that President Trump's decision to withdraw from the international Paris climate agreement was wrong. But their solutions differ. Mr Sanders has been touting his ""Green New Deal"" - a $16.3tn (Â£12.5tn) package that he says would create 20 million jobs and pay for itself over 15 years. Mr Biden's plan envisages eliminating net greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 - with targets going beyond Mr Obama's goals. His plan would cost $1.7tn for the first decade, alone. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter Mississippi
was the first state to be called for Biden on Tuesday, and it was only the
latest example of the strengths of his campaign - and another reason why the
former vice-president appears to be in the driverâs seat as the primary season
unfolds. As in
South Carolina - the state that started Bidenâs political revival - more than 60%
of the Mississippi electorate is black. And, as in South Carolina, the former
vice-president dominated that demographic, to the tune of 86-11. The common
refrain that a Democrat canât win the nomination without the support of black
voters, somewhat in doubt after Sandersâ dominating win in the Nevada caucuses,
now seems to once again be an ironclad rule. The
Mississippi result is also important because of what it means for the delegate
calculations that will determine the nomination. Biden isnât just winning the
state, heâs dominating it. Heâs going to win the lionâs share of the stateâs 36
delegates to the national convention, further extending his delegate lead.
Given that delegates are awarded proportionally, to catch up Sanders
would have to start winning in some states by similarly large margins. Barring
some sort of drastic change in the race, that seems unlikely in the extreme.
With every state Sanders loses, he falls farther behind - and the more
improbable his comeback would be. Bernie Sanders will not address his supporters tonight, says CBS. The news comes during a disappointing night so far for the Vermont senator - he has lost to Joe Biden in all three states to report results. Results from three potentially more favourable states - North Dakota, Idaho and Washington - are to come. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Senator Sanders is promising a revolution in the US. His supporters see his policy goals as the kind of overhaul the country needs to fix deep-seated problems. But his critics have accused him of trying to turn the country of free enterprise into a socialist state-run republic that entrusts the government with a lot more than Americans are used to. For instance, nationalised universal health care, cancelling student debt, and plans to tackle climate change would cost an additional $40tn in government spending over the next decade alone. Sanders says he will raise money through new taxes and the savings earned from his reforms are massive. Critics say his costing figures do not add up. Do they? The BBC's Reality Check did the maths. Read here what they found out. Polls inIdahoclose in 40 minutes. Generally a Republican-safe state in presidential elections, it was the nationâs fastest-growing state last year, bringing its population to nearly 1.8 million. With such a surge, some wonder if the added voters could turn this red state (meaning Republican-leaning) a little more blue (favouring Democrats). Idaho Democrats will also be participating in a primary for the first time - theyâve used caucuses in the past - which may have an impact on voter turnout, and the results overall. Either way, results today could give us a hint of what is to come in Novemberâs general election.   Bernie Sanders is projected to lose Michigan, a state where he drew an adoring crowd of about 10,000 just two days ago. Jonathan Turley, a law professor and BBC contributor who was visiting the college campus in Ann Arbor, spoke to supporters. He found clues that explain both the senator's popularity with young people - and also the limits of his appeal with his own older generation. Now, he has not just the numbers but the movement that he always dreamt of. Indeed, he is the movement. While some might not want socialism, everyone in this crowd desperately wants Sanders. Arden Shapiro and Hazel Gordon are precisely why the Democratic establishment is so worried about this movement - and so seemingly incapable of tapping into its energy. While they would vote for Biden if forced to in an election against Trump, they see Sanders as the only true and clear voice in the race. Arden said that she was ""really angry"" about the level of corporate control in our system perpetrated by both parties. A trans woman, Hazel said that she saw Sanders as the only person truly fighting to help people secure medical insurance, particularly mental health coverage. Hazel said that she viewed Biden as taking the side of corporations and did not support anything she believed in. Arden would later help introduce Sanders at the rally and called on her fellow students to bring five friends to the polling places to secure a win in Michigan over the establishment. Others were even more direct. There were the guys distributing ""Eat the Rich"" T-shirts. Another supporter carried a sign reading ""Make Racists Afraid Again"". Those images unnerve many traditional Democratic voters who see this movement as potentially careening out of control. Read Jonathan's full viewpoint piece. Let's take a step back from the horse race tonight and take a wider view on the election. Here are some great explainers: BIG PICTURE:All you need to know about presidential race SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the primaries and caucuses? ISSUES:See how Biden and Sanders compare to Clinton, Obama and LBJ TURNOUT:Why don't more young people vote? BIDEN:Five areas where he's vulnerable SANDERS:Do his spending plans add up?     Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter Four
years ago, Michigan gave Bernie Sanders a surprise win - albeit a narrow, 49-48
one - breathing new life into a campaign that was struggling after Hillary
Clinton dominated Super Tuesday. This
time around, the mid-western state could mark the beginning of the end for his
campaign. The
difference, according to exit polls, were white voters, union voters and college
graduates. Sanders won all three groups in 2016. On Tuesday night, Biden put
them in his column. He carried college graduates 51-44, whites 51-45 and union
members - 30% of the primary electorate - 54-42. Add that
to Bidenâs already strong performance among black voters, late-deciders and
those who are looking for someone who can beat Donald Trump, and itâs the
recipe for a comfortable win for the vice-president. The ease
of the result will raise new questions about whether the 2016 Michigan primary was
a reflection more of Clintonâs weakness rather than Sandersâ strength. At the
very least, itâs evidence that rather than improving on his 2016 performance,
the Vermont senator is falling short. And if heâs falling short in Michigan,
his window to the Democratic nomination is on the verge of slamming shut. Former Democratic candidate and self-declared ""Asian math guy"" Andrew Yang has endorsed Joe Biden for the nomination. This race is about ""getting real solutions in place,"" Yang said, adding that Biden called him last week. ""We had a really great conversation."" ""I wanted to let the Democratic process play out and I believe it has,"" Yang said, explaining why he had not endorsed earlier. ""We need to come together as a party, starting tonight.""

For voters in Washington - the centre of the US coronavirus outbreak - the vote may be overshadowed by the ongoing spread of Covid-19. So will it hurt turnout? There's good reason to think it won't: Washington is one of a handful of states thatconducts elections entirely by mail. All registered voters get a ballot sent to their address about two weeks before election day and they have two weeks to send it back in - meaning there are no polling places, door handles, or necessary physical contact. Still, Covid-19 hasn't been forgotten - officials have urged voters not to seal their envelopes with a lick. Because of all the postal votes to count, we might not get a result called from Washington state tonight. As results come in across six US states, Donald Trump's campaign released a statement calling Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders ""two sides of the same coin"". ""The Democrat candidate for president will be
running on a big government socialist agenda regardless of the name on the
ballot."" ""Either way, President Trump is on an unstoppable drive toward
re-election.â As expected, Trump has won the Republican contests in Mississippi, Missouri and Michigan. Technically, he is not the official Republican candidate until it is announced at the convention. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Coronavirus is spreading in the UK and the government is seeking ways to minimise its spread. Without drastic measures - which could be in place for weeks, or even months - it is feared that more than 250,000 people could die. All members of the public should reduce the time they spend with others: Everyone should stop non-essential contact with others. This is particularly important for people over 70, those with underlying health conditions and pregnant women People should work from home if they can Cafes, pubs and restaurants are being closed from Friday night - except for take-away food - to tackle coronavirus People should stop all unnecessary travel Those most at risk - about 1.5 million who've had organ transplants, have severe respiratory conditions or some cancers - should not go out for 12 weeks, and will be given essential supplies if they don't have a support system of their own Everyone should continue to regularly wash their hands and avoid contacting the NHS unless it's essential. The strongest warnings are in place for those who are ill and the people close to them: Anyone with a fever or persistent cough should stay at home for seven days Anyone who lives with someone displaying coronavirus symptoms should also stay at home for 14 days.People who have to isolate themselvesshould ask others for help The government's thinking has changed quickly. It started off trying to contain coronavirus by isolating people who tested positive and asking anyone who had close contact with them to self-isolate too. Ministers then introduced policies to delay and reduce the peak, when the most cases are expected. The idea was that by pushing it back to the summer it would allow the NHS to cope. But modelling from Imperial College London prompted a change in approach. It warned the policy of a managed spread could lead to more than 250,000 deaths, with hospital intensive care units getting overwhelmed. Ministers are now seeking to suppress the spread completely. They hope this will keep deaths below 20,000. We are in uncharted territory - so it is impossible to tell. However, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has suggested that""we can turn the tide within the next 12 weeks"". But the problem with trying to suppress the virus is that as soon as you lift those measures the fear is it could quickly return. One option from experts advising the government is to go through a cycle of lifting and reapplying restrictions, using demand on intensive care as a guide. There will be close attention paid to China, which is now looking at how it lifts restrictions. It is not realistic to think that if you temporarily break the spread of coronavirus it will go away. Then you have to consider the social and economic factors at play. Businesses are going to struggle and people are going to lose their jobs. And how long are the public going to put up with being told they cannot go out, need to work from home and can no longer watch sport or go to festivals? It leaves the government with some very difficult decisions to take. EASY STEPS:What can I do? A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash The whole of the NHS has been put on an emergency footing. From mid-April all routine operations, such as knee and hip replacements, are being cancelled for three months. Hospitals have plans to keep coronavirus patients separate and supply staff with protective masks and suits. All hospital patients with flu-like symptoms are being tested. Patients with mild symptoms - a high temperature or new and persistent cough - are being asked to self-isolate at home. Community teams will keep an eye on them if need be. But people are being advised not to ring NHS 111 to report their symptoms unless they are worried. Currently there is no treatment or cure, so hospitals are trying to relieve the symptoms. Specialist ECMO breathing equipment is at five units for patients whose lungs fail. There are between 4,000 and 5,000 intensive care beds. But NHS officials said they can effectively increase that to between 11,000 and 12,000 by using ventilators reserved for planned surgery and those available in the private sector, Ministry of Defence, new ones being made and old stocks that are no longer used. Ministers are also working with private companies to ramp up production. A third of patients who need hospital care require intensive care support, evidence from China and Italy suggests. Doctors warn that some difficult decisions may need to be made about which patients get treatment. What questions do you have about the UK's coronavirus plans?

"Joe Biden has won Mississippi, Missouri and Michigan, CBS projects These victories mean he tightens his grip on the Democratic race for the White House Democrats are choosing a candidate to run against Republican Donald Trump in November Bernie Sanders is his only challenger but his path to the nomination is narrowing But some of the best states for Sanders lie ahead tonight Idaho and Washington stop voting at 23:00 ET (03:00 GMT) Votes are still being counted in N Dakota Tom Geoghegan, Paulin Kola, Holly Honderich and Ben Bevington We're winding down our coverage of the Democratic presidential primaries. Joe Biden claimed victory in Michigan, Mississippi and Missouri - vaulting the former vice-president further ahead of rival Bernie Sanders. It's not yet clear who will win the remaining states - North Dakota, Washington and Idaho. What is clear is that Joe Biden now has tightened his grip on victory. Now that polls have closed. we're looking to see which of the two leading candidates - Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders - have won each of the six states that voted today. But the number that really matters is thedelegate count. The primaries and caucuses are all about winning delegates - party members from a state who pledge to endorse a candidate at the party conventions in July. The number of delegates varies from state to state. The target for any candidate is to reach an unbeatable majority of1,990 delegates. As of now - and this will change as results trickle in - Joe Biden boasts813 delegates, a sturdy lead over Bernie Sander's656. Need a little background? Looking for some context? Here are some great explainers: BIG PICTURE:All you need to know about presidential race SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the primaries and caucuses? ISSUES:See how Biden and Sanders compare to Clinton, Obama and LBJ TURNOUT:Why don't more young people vote? BIDEN:Five areas where he's vulnerable SANDERS:Do his spending plans add up?  The US is facing an outbreak of coronavirus across the country, and two states voting today have been affected. One confirmed case has been reported inMissouriandWashingtonhas the highest number of reported cases - 270 - of any US state. But the show (election) must go on. As that AOC speech shows, no-one in the Democratic race has been able to harness youth support like Sanders. The BBC's Anthony Zurcher writes: Once
again, he performed best with ages 17 to 29,
according to exit polls. He carried it 82-15 in Michigan and 76-19 in Missouri,
and only lost it by 4% in Mississippi, despite being routed in the state. The
problem for the Vermont senator, however, was that the age group averaged only
12.5% of the electorate in those three states - not nearly enough to save the
day for Sanders. The epitaph for his campaign may be that it was premised, in
part, on the passion of new young voters who simply did not show up in
sufficient numbers at the polling booths. While
this may be good news in the short term for Biden, it is a flashing warning
sign for the general election if he is the nominee. Young voters were a key
part of the coalition that delivered the White House to Barack Obama in 2008,
as he won them by a record 34% over John McCain. If the former vice-president
does not find some way to improve his standing with this age demographic, he
may suffer the same fate as Hillary Clinton, who only won the youth vote by
18%. Read more: Why don't more young people vote?  New York Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez - progressive darling and Bernie Sanders' star surrogate - took to Instagram Live this evening as tonight's results looked increasingly dim for her candidate. ""There's no sugar coating it,"" she said to the nearly 10,000 users watching. ""Tonight's a tough night for the movement overall."" Describing a ""stark"" generational divide"" - younger voters for Sanders, older voters for Biden - Ocasio-Cortez told followers it was time to ""leverage"" support for Sanders and his policies, like Medicare for All. âNow is the time to ask for
accountability. And now is the time to ask for commitments - real commitments - not just gestures.â The final polls of the night - Idaho and Washington - have closed. Votes are still being counted in North Dakota. It is still too early to call the results for any of these three contests. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter On a
cool Tuesday evening at the University of South Florida campus in Tampa,
Florida, Bernie Sanders supporters gathered to plan and give themselves a pep
talk for the final week before the stateâs primary. A young
campaign worker told the crowd of students that the establishment - Democratic
rivals, the media and big corporations - were organising against their
candidate. But while they couldnât control what happened on Super Tuesday last
week or in Michigan, Washington and other states tonight, they are the ones
that get to decide whether Sanders wins in Florida and in their town and their
precincts. After another rought night tonight, his back will be to the wall,
and heâll need a good result in Florida, as well as other big states holding
primaries next week, such as Illinois and Ohio. Maria
Zamora and Sharman Hashmi, who attended the event, say they are still
optimistic about Sandersâ chances. âSanders
really stands behind the people who havenât had a voice for a long time,â
Zamora, who is on staff at the university, says. ""I feel like those people
are going to support him no matter what."" In the midst of another promising night - compounding his already commanding lead - Joe Biden thanked supporters and celebrated his political comeback. Just a week ago, pundits declared this campaign dead, he said. ""Now we're very much alive. ""It's a comeback for the soul of this nation. ""I take nothing for granted, I want to earn every single vote in every single state."" Earlier we brought you their healthcare and education differences. The third and final policy to explore is the one many believe to be the most important of all - climate change. They both believe cimate change is real, and that President Trump's decision to withdraw from the international Paris climate agreement was wrong. But their solutions differ. Mr Sanders has been touting his ""Green New Deal"" - a $16.3tn (Â£12.5tn) package that he says would create 20 million jobs and pay for itself over 15 years. Mr Biden's plan envisages eliminating net greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 - with targets going beyond Mr Obama's goals. His plan would cost $1.7tn for the first decade, alone. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter Mississippi
was the first state to be called for Biden on Tuesday, and it was only the
latest example of the strengths of his campaign - and another reason why the
former vice-president appears to be in the driverâs seat as the primary season
unfolds. As in
South Carolina - the state that started Bidenâs political revival - more than 60%
of the Mississippi electorate is black. And, as in South Carolina, the former
vice-president dominated that demographic, to the tune of 86-11. The common
refrain that a Democrat canât win the nomination without the support of black
voters, somewhat in doubt after Sandersâ dominating win in the Nevada caucuses,
now seems to once again be an ironclad rule. The
Mississippi result is also important because of what it means for the delegate
calculations that will determine the nomination. Biden isnât just winning the
state, heâs dominating it. Heâs going to win the lionâs share of the stateâs 36
delegates to the national convention, further extending his delegate lead.
Given that delegates are awarded proportionally, to catch up Sanders
would have to start winning in some states by similarly large margins. Barring
some sort of drastic change in the race, that seems unlikely in the extreme.
With every state Sanders loses, he falls farther behind - and the more
improbable his comeback would be. Bernie Sanders will not address his supporters tonight, says CBS. The news comes during a disappointing night so far for the Vermont senator - he has lost to Joe Biden in all three states to report results. Results from three potentially more favourable states - North Dakota, Idaho and Washington - are to come. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Senator Sanders is promising a revolution in the US. His supporters see his policy goals as the kind of overhaul the country needs to fix deep-seated problems. But his critics have accused him of trying to turn the country of free enterprise into a socialist state-run republic that entrusts the government with a lot more than Americans are used to. For instance, nationalised universal health care, cancelling student debt, and plans to tackle climate change would cost an additional $40tn in government spending over the next decade alone. Sanders says he will raise money through new taxes and the savings earned from his reforms are massive. Critics say his costing figures do not add up. Do they? The BBC's Reality Check did the maths. Read here what they found out. Polls inIdahoclose in 40 minutes. Generally a Republican-safe state in presidential elections, it was the nationâs fastest-growing state last year, bringing its population to nearly 1.8 million. With such a surge, some wonder if the added voters could turn this red state (meaning Republican-leaning) a little more blue (favouring Democrats). Idaho Democrats will also be participating in a primary for the first time - theyâve used caucuses in the past - which may have an impact on voter turnout, and the results overall. Either way, results today could give us a hint of what is to come in Novemberâs general election.   Bernie Sanders is projected to lose Michigan, a state where he drew an adoring crowd of about 10,000 just two days ago. Jonathan Turley, a law professor and BBC contributor who was visiting the college campus in Ann Arbor, spoke to supporters. He found clues that explain both the senator's popularity with young people - and also the limits of his appeal with his own older generation. Now, he has not just the numbers but the movement that he always dreamt of. Indeed, he is the movement. While some might not want socialism, everyone in this crowd desperately wants Sanders. Arden Shapiro and Hazel Gordon are precisely why the Democratic establishment is so worried about this movement - and so seemingly incapable of tapping into its energy. While they would vote for Biden if forced to in an election against Trump, they see Sanders as the only true and clear voice in the race. Arden said that she was ""really angry"" about the level of corporate control in our system perpetrated by both parties. A trans woman, Hazel said that she saw Sanders as the only person truly fighting to help people secure medical insurance, particularly mental health coverage. Hazel said that she viewed Biden as taking the side of corporations and did not support anything she believed in. Arden would later help introduce Sanders at the rally and called on her fellow students to bring five friends to the polling places to secure a win in Michigan over the establishment. Others were even more direct. There were the guys distributing ""Eat the Rich"" T-shirts. Another supporter carried a sign reading ""Make Racists Afraid Again"". Those images unnerve many traditional Democratic voters who see this movement as potentially careening out of control. Read Jonathan's full viewpoint piece. Let's take a step back from the horse race tonight and take a wider view on the election. Here are some great explainers: BIG PICTURE:All you need to know about presidential race SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the primaries and caucuses? ISSUES:See how Biden and Sanders compare to Clinton, Obama and LBJ TURNOUT:Why don't more young people vote? BIDEN:Five areas where he's vulnerable SANDERS:Do his spending plans add up?     Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter Four
years ago, Michigan gave Bernie Sanders a surprise win - albeit a narrow, 49-48
one - breathing new life into a campaign that was struggling after Hillary
Clinton dominated Super Tuesday. This
time around, the mid-western state could mark the beginning of the end for his
campaign. The
difference, according to exit polls, were white voters, union voters and college
graduates. Sanders won all three groups in 2016. On Tuesday night, Biden put
them in his column. He carried college graduates 51-44, whites 51-45 and union
members - 30% of the primary electorate - 54-42. Add that
to Bidenâs already strong performance among black voters, late-deciders and
those who are looking for someone who can beat Donald Trump, and itâs the
recipe for a comfortable win for the vice-president. The ease
of the result will raise new questions about whether the 2016 Michigan primary was
a reflection more of Clintonâs weakness rather than Sandersâ strength. At the
very least, itâs evidence that rather than improving on his 2016 performance,
the Vermont senator is falling short. And if heâs falling short in Michigan,
his window to the Democratic nomination is on the verge of slamming shut. Former Democratic candidate and self-declared ""Asian math guy"" Andrew Yang has endorsed Joe Biden for the nomination. This race is about ""getting real solutions in place,"" Yang said, adding that Biden called him last week. ""We had a really great conversation."" ""I wanted to let the Democratic process play out and I believe it has,"" Yang said, explaining why he had not endorsed earlier. ""We need to come together as a party, starting tonight.""

"The giraffes lived in an unfenced conservancy Two extremely rare white giraffes have been killed by poachers in north-eastern Kenya, conservationists say. Rangers had found the carcasses of the female and her calf in a village in north-eastern Kenya's Garissa County. A third white giraffe is still alive. It is thought to be the only remaining one in the world, the conservationists added. Their white appearance is due to a rare condition called leucism, which causes skin cells to have no pigmentation. News of the white giraffes spread across the world after they were photographed in 2017. Africa Live: Updates on this and other stories Giraffes given greater protection Giraffes added to vulnerable list The manager of the Ishaqbini Hirola Community Conservancy, Mohammed Ahmednoor, said the two killed giraffes were last spotted more than three months ago. ""This is a very sad day for the community of Ijara and Kenya as a whole. We are the only community in the world who are custodians of the white giraffe,"" Mr Ahmednoor said in a statement. ""Its killing is a blow to the tremendous steps taken by the community to conserve rare and unique species and a wake-up call for continued support to conservation efforts,"" he added. The poachers have not yet been identified, and their motive is still unclear. The Kenya Wildlife Society, the main conservation body in the East African state, said it was investigating the killings. What is leucism? Leucism inhibits pigmentation in some skin cells It is different to albinism where no melanin is produced at all Animals with leucism may have darker pigment in their soft tissue Giraffes with leucism retain their dark eyes, whereas animals with albinism have pink eyes Birds, lions, fish, peacocks, penguins, eagles, hippos, moose and snakes have all displayed traits of leucism The conservancy is in a vast unfenced area. There are also villages within the conservancy. White giraffes were first spotted in Kenya in March 2016,external, about two months after a sighting in neighbouring Tanzania, the conservancy says on its website. Some 40% of the giraffe population has disappeared in the last 30 years and poaching for meat and skin continues,according to the Africa Wildlife Foundation,external. The population went from around 155,000 in 1985 to 97,000 in 2015, according to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN).

"Railways will be among the infrastructure to see a boost in funding after Wednesday's budget The government will promise to raise infrastructure spending to its highest in decades in Wednesday's Budget. It will pledge to triple the average net investment made over the last 40 years into rail and road, affordable housing, broadband and research. The Treasury told the BBC it would lead to the ""highest levels [of investment] in real terms since 1955"" - more than Â£600bn over the five-year Parliament. Chancellor Rishi Sunak will present the Budget less than a month into the job. It comes as the government faces calls for increased investment in a number of sectors to help tackle the coronavrius outbreak. On Sunday, Mr Sunak told the BBC's Andrew Marrthe NHS would get ""whatever resources it needs"" during the crisis. The chancellor also said he was looking at extra financial help for individuals and businesses if measures against the virus meant they were out of pocket. Budget 2020: The economy must be vaccinated Your essential guide to the Budget Government to pledge billions for filling potholes The BBC understands Mr Sunak will promise a gross amount of over Â£600bn for capital spending - money put into projects like roads and rail - by the middle of 2025. The chancellor said: ""We have listened and will now deliver on our promise to level up the UK, ensuring everyone has the same chances and opportunities in life, wherever they live. ""By investing historic amounts in British innovation and world-class infrastructure, we will rebalance opportunities and lay the foundations for a decade of growth for everybody."" BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the decision marked a significant increase in the amount of spending on capital projects compared to the period since Margaret Thatcher came to power in 1979. However, she said it was not yet clear if the government would stick to its own fiscal rules set out in its manifesto. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said the plans were ""exaggerated claims"". He added: ""We've heard it all before. ""The Chancellor seems to have forgotten we have to dig ourselves out of the Â£192bn hole in our infrastructure spend created by his government. ""Boris Johnson has a track record of boastful claims followed by non delivery and it looks like he is running true to form."" If you wondered what the government's new buzz phrase of ""levelling up"" was meant to mean, the Conservatives will try to provide the answer tomorrow. In his first budget, the Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, will commit to the biggest increase on spending on capital - roads, rail, research - that there has been in generations. He's expected to promise to sign a hypothetical cheque of more than Â£600bn of gross public sector investment, to be cashed by the middle of 2025, we understand. And the Treasury tonight claims it will push public investment in real terms to levels not seen since 1955. But it's wise to be careful with the historical claims. The economy is totally different to that era. Read more from Laura here. The government is also set to pledgeÂ£2.5bn to fixing potholes in Englandas part of the Budget. The Treasury said the funding package would also be available to local authorities to start resurfacing works, preventing potholes from appearing in the first place.

"Joe Biden has won Mississippi, Missouri and Michigan, CBS projects These victories mean he tightens his grip on the Democratic race for the White House Democrats are choosing a candidate to run against Republican Donald Trump in November Bernie Sanders is his only challenger but his path to the nomination is narrowing But some of the best states for Sanders lie ahead tonight Idaho and Washington stop voting at 23:00 ET (03:00 GMT) Votes are still being counted in N Dakota Tom Geoghegan, Paulin Kola, Holly Honderich and Ben Bevington We're winding down our coverage of the Democratic presidential primaries. Joe Biden claimed victory in Michigan, Mississippi and Missouri - vaulting the former vice-president further ahead of rival Bernie Sanders. It's not yet clear who will win the remaining states - North Dakota, Washington and Idaho. What is clear is that Joe Biden now has tightened his grip on victory. Now that polls have closed. we're looking to see which of the two leading candidates - Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders - have won each of the six states that voted today. But the number that really matters is thedelegate count. The primaries and caucuses are all about winning delegates - party members from a state who pledge to endorse a candidate at the party conventions in July. The number of delegates varies from state to state. The target for any candidate is to reach an unbeatable majority of1,990 delegates. As of now - and this will change as results trickle in - Joe Biden boasts813 delegates, a sturdy lead over Bernie Sander's656. Need a little background? Looking for some context? Here are some great explainers: BIG PICTURE:All you need to know about presidential race SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the primaries and caucuses? ISSUES:See how Biden and Sanders compare to Clinton, Obama and LBJ TURNOUT:Why don't more young people vote? BIDEN:Five areas where he's vulnerable SANDERS:Do his spending plans add up?  The US is facing an outbreak of coronavirus across the country, and two states voting today have been affected. One confirmed case has been reported inMissouriandWashingtonhas the highest number of reported cases - 270 - of any US state. But the show (election) must go on. As that AOC speech shows, no-one in the Democratic race has been able to harness youth support like Sanders. The BBC's Anthony Zurcher writes: Once
again, he performed best with ages 17 to 29,
according to exit polls. He carried it 82-15 in Michigan and 76-19 in Missouri,
and only lost it by 4% in Mississippi, despite being routed in the state. The
problem for the Vermont senator, however, was that the age group averaged only
12.5% of the electorate in those three states - not nearly enough to save the
day for Sanders. The epitaph for his campaign may be that it was premised, in
part, on the passion of new young voters who simply did not show up in
sufficient numbers at the polling booths. While
this may be good news in the short term for Biden, it is a flashing warning
sign for the general election if he is the nominee. Young voters were a key
part of the coalition that delivered the White House to Barack Obama in 2008,
as he won them by a record 34% over John McCain. If the former vice-president
does not find some way to improve his standing with this age demographic, he
may suffer the same fate as Hillary Clinton, who only won the youth vote by
18%. Read more: Why don't more young people vote?  New York Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez - progressive darling and Bernie Sanders' star surrogate - took to Instagram Live this evening as tonight's results looked increasingly dim for her candidate. ""There's no sugar coating it,"" she said to the nearly 10,000 users watching. ""Tonight's a tough night for the movement overall."" Describing a ""stark"" generational divide"" - younger voters for Sanders, older voters for Biden - Ocasio-Cortez told followers it was time to ""leverage"" support for Sanders and his policies, like Medicare for All. âNow is the time to ask for
accountability. And now is the time to ask for commitments - real commitments - not just gestures.â The final polls of the night - Idaho and Washington - have closed. Votes are still being counted in North Dakota. It is still too early to call the results for any of these three contests. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter On a
cool Tuesday evening at the University of South Florida campus in Tampa,
Florida, Bernie Sanders supporters gathered to plan and give themselves a pep
talk for the final week before the stateâs primary. A young
campaign worker told the crowd of students that the establishment - Democratic
rivals, the media and big corporations - were organising against their
candidate. But while they couldnât control what happened on Super Tuesday last
week or in Michigan, Washington and other states tonight, they are the ones
that get to decide whether Sanders wins in Florida and in their town and their
precincts. After another rought night tonight, his back will be to the wall,
and heâll need a good result in Florida, as well as other big states holding
primaries next week, such as Illinois and Ohio. Maria
Zamora and Sharman Hashmi, who attended the event, say they are still
optimistic about Sandersâ chances. âSanders
really stands behind the people who havenât had a voice for a long time,â
Zamora, who is on staff at the university, says. ""I feel like those people
are going to support him no matter what."" In the midst of another promising night - compounding his already commanding lead - Joe Biden thanked supporters and celebrated his political comeback. Just a week ago, pundits declared this campaign dead, he said. ""Now we're very much alive. ""It's a comeback for the soul of this nation. ""I take nothing for granted, I want to earn every single vote in every single state."" Earlier we brought you their healthcare and education differences. The third and final policy to explore is the one many believe to be the most important of all - climate change. They both believe cimate change is real, and that President Trump's decision to withdraw from the international Paris climate agreement was wrong. But their solutions differ. Mr Sanders has been touting his ""Green New Deal"" - a $16.3tn (Â£12.5tn) package that he says would create 20 million jobs and pay for itself over 15 years. Mr Biden's plan envisages eliminating net greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 - with targets going beyond Mr Obama's goals. His plan would cost $1.7tn for the first decade, alone. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter Mississippi
was the first state to be called for Biden on Tuesday, and it was only the
latest example of the strengths of his campaign - and another reason why the
former vice-president appears to be in the driverâs seat as the primary season
unfolds. As in
South Carolina - the state that started Bidenâs political revival - more than 60%
of the Mississippi electorate is black. And, as in South Carolina, the former
vice-president dominated that demographic, to the tune of 86-11. The common
refrain that a Democrat canât win the nomination without the support of black
voters, somewhat in doubt after Sandersâ dominating win in the Nevada caucuses,
now seems to once again be an ironclad rule. The
Mississippi result is also important because of what it means for the delegate
calculations that will determine the nomination. Biden isnât just winning the
state, heâs dominating it. Heâs going to win the lionâs share of the stateâs 36
delegates to the national convention, further extending his delegate lead.
Given that delegates are awarded proportionally, to catch up Sanders
would have to start winning in some states by similarly large margins. Barring
some sort of drastic change in the race, that seems unlikely in the extreme.
With every state Sanders loses, he falls farther behind - and the more
improbable his comeback would be. Bernie Sanders will not address his supporters tonight, says CBS. The news comes during a disappointing night so far for the Vermont senator - he has lost to Joe Biden in all three states to report results. Results from three potentially more favourable states - North Dakota, Idaho and Washington - are to come. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Senator Sanders is promising a revolution in the US. His supporters see his policy goals as the kind of overhaul the country needs to fix deep-seated problems. But his critics have accused him of trying to turn the country of free enterprise into a socialist state-run republic that entrusts the government with a lot more than Americans are used to. For instance, nationalised universal health care, cancelling student debt, and plans to tackle climate change would cost an additional $40tn in government spending over the next decade alone. Sanders says he will raise money through new taxes and the savings earned from his reforms are massive. Critics say his costing figures do not add up. Do they? The BBC's Reality Check did the maths. Read here what they found out. Polls inIdahoclose in 40 minutes. Generally a Republican-safe state in presidential elections, it was the nationâs fastest-growing state last year, bringing its population to nearly 1.8 million. With such a surge, some wonder if the added voters could turn this red state (meaning Republican-leaning) a little more blue (favouring Democrats). Idaho Democrats will also be participating in a primary for the first time - theyâve used caucuses in the past - which may have an impact on voter turnout, and the results overall. Either way, results today could give us a hint of what is to come in Novemberâs general election.   Bernie Sanders is projected to lose Michigan, a state where he drew an adoring crowd of about 10,000 just two days ago. Jonathan Turley, a law professor and BBC contributor who was visiting the college campus in Ann Arbor, spoke to supporters. He found clues that explain both the senator's popularity with young people - and also the limits of his appeal with his own older generation. Now, he has not just the numbers but the movement that he always dreamt of. Indeed, he is the movement. While some might not want socialism, everyone in this crowd desperately wants Sanders. Arden Shapiro and Hazel Gordon are precisely why the Democratic establishment is so worried about this movement - and so seemingly incapable of tapping into its energy. While they would vote for Biden if forced to in an election against Trump, they see Sanders as the only true and clear voice in the race. Arden said that she was ""really angry"" about the level of corporate control in our system perpetrated by both parties. A trans woman, Hazel said that she saw Sanders as the only person truly fighting to help people secure medical insurance, particularly mental health coverage. Hazel said that she viewed Biden as taking the side of corporations and did not support anything she believed in. Arden would later help introduce Sanders at the rally and called on her fellow students to bring five friends to the polling places to secure a win in Michigan over the establishment. Others were even more direct. There were the guys distributing ""Eat the Rich"" T-shirts. Another supporter carried a sign reading ""Make Racists Afraid Again"". Those images unnerve many traditional Democratic voters who see this movement as potentially careening out of control. Read Jonathan's full viewpoint piece. Let's take a step back from the horse race tonight and take a wider view on the election. Here are some great explainers: BIG PICTURE:All you need to know about presidential race SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the primaries and caucuses? ISSUES:See how Biden and Sanders compare to Clinton, Obama and LBJ TURNOUT:Why don't more young people vote? BIDEN:Five areas where he's vulnerable SANDERS:Do his spending plans add up?     Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter Four
years ago, Michigan gave Bernie Sanders a surprise win - albeit a narrow, 49-48
one - breathing new life into a campaign that was struggling after Hillary
Clinton dominated Super Tuesday. This
time around, the mid-western state could mark the beginning of the end for his
campaign. The
difference, according to exit polls, were white voters, union voters and college
graduates. Sanders won all three groups in 2016. On Tuesday night, Biden put
them in his column. He carried college graduates 51-44, whites 51-45 and union
members - 30% of the primary electorate - 54-42. Add that
to Bidenâs already strong performance among black voters, late-deciders and
those who are looking for someone who can beat Donald Trump, and itâs the
recipe for a comfortable win for the vice-president. The ease
of the result will raise new questions about whether the 2016 Michigan primary was
a reflection more of Clintonâs weakness rather than Sandersâ strength. At the
very least, itâs evidence that rather than improving on his 2016 performance,
the Vermont senator is falling short. And if heâs falling short in Michigan,
his window to the Democratic nomination is on the verge of slamming shut. Former Democratic candidate and self-declared ""Asian math guy"" Andrew Yang has endorsed Joe Biden for the nomination. This race is about ""getting real solutions in place,"" Yang said, adding that Biden called him last week. ""We had a really great conversation."" ""I wanted to let the Democratic process play out and I believe it has,"" Yang said, explaining why he had not endorsed earlier. ""We need to come together as a party, starting tonight."" Want to know more about the Yang Gang? Read about the political novice and his devoted base here.  For voters in Washington - the centre of the US coronavirus outbreak - the vote may be overshadowed by the ongoing spread of Covid-19. So will it hurt turnout? There's good reason to think it won't: Washington is one of a handful of states thatconducts elections entirely by mail. All registered voters get a ballot sent to their address about two weeks before election day and they have two weeks to send it back in - meaning there are no polling places, door handles, or necessary physical contact. Still, Covid-19 hasn't been forgotten - officials have urged voters not to seal their envelopes with a lick. Because of all the postal votes to count, we might not get a result called from Washington state tonight. As results come in across six US states, Donald Trump's campaign released a statement calling Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders ""two sides of the same coin"". ""The Democrat candidate for president will be
running on a big government socialist agenda regardless of the name on the
ballot."" ""Either way, President Trump is on an unstoppable drive toward
re-election.â As expected, Trump has won the Republican contests in Mississippi, Missouri and Michigan. Technically, he is not the official Republican candidate until it is announced at the convention. Â© 2025 BBC.

"The tiny forest in Witney is said to be the first of its kind in the UK A ""tiny forest"" - said to be the first of its kind in the UK - is being planted in Oxfordshire in a bid to tackle urban wildlife loss. Six-hundred native trees will fill a 200-sq-m plot - about the size of a tennis court - in Witney, Oxfordshire. The small, fast-growing and dense forest, planted by environmental charity Earthwatch and Witney Town Council, will mimic native woodland. The charity said plans were already under way to create another in Oxford. Tiny forests are based on forest management methods developed in the 1970s by Japanese botanist Dr Akira Miyawaki. The trees, which are being planted by council staff and volunteers, are able to store carbon, soak up water to reduce flooding, attract wildlife, reduce dust, improve air quality and cut noise pollution. Earthwatch is bringing the scheme to the UK with the help of Dutch organisation IVN Nature Education, which has planted nearly 100 tiny forests in the Netherlands. Earthwatch Europe's senior research lead, Victor Beumer, said: ""We are excited to be planting a tiny forest, the first of its kind in the UK, in partnership with Witney Town Council. ""At a time when it seems impossible to overcome the enormous challenge of the climate and ecological crisis, tiny forests offer a collaborative natural solution with far-reaching benefits. ""We hope to inspire individuals, businesses and government to take environmental action, by supporting a tiny forest in their local area."" 'Stand up and say upskirting is wrong' My dark past growing up in a rural English commune Villagers buy their own 999 vehicle Witney town councillor Vicky Gwatkin said: ""The global environmental crisis focuses the mind but also provides a tremendous opportunity to think outside the box, giving us the confidence to experiment and try new things.

ISSUES:See how Biden and Sanders compare to Clinton, Obama and LBJ TURNOUT:Why don't more young people vote? BIDEN:Five areas where he's vulnerable SANDERS:Do his spending plans add up?     Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter Four
years ago, Michigan gave Bernie Sanders a surprise win - albeit a narrow, 49-48
one - breathing new life into a campaign that was struggling after Hillary
Clinton dominated Super Tuesday. This
time around, the mid-western state could mark the beginning of the end for his
campaign. The
difference, according to exit polls, were white voters, union voters and college
graduates. Sanders won all three groups in 2016. On Tuesday night, Biden put
them in his column. He carried college graduates 51-44, whites 51-45 and union
members - 30% of the primary electorate - 54-42. Add that
to Bidenâs already strong performance among black voters, late-deciders and
those who are looking for someone who can beat Donald Trump, and itâs the
recipe for a comfortable win for the vice-president. The ease
of the result will raise new questions about whether the 2016 Michigan primary was
a reflection more of Clintonâs weakness rather than Sandersâ strength. At the
very least, itâs evidence that rather than improving on his 2016 performance,
the Vermont senator is falling short. And if heâs falling short in Michigan,
his window to the Democratic nomination is on the verge of slamming shut. Former Democratic candidate and self-declared ""Asian math guy"" Andrew Yang has endorsed Joe Biden for the nomination. This race is about ""getting real solutions in place,"" Yang said, adding that Biden called him last week. ""We had a really great conversation."" ""I wanted to let the Democratic process play out and I believe it has,"" Yang said, explaining why he had not endorsed earlier. ""We need to come together as a party, starting tonight.""

For voters in Washington - the centre of the US coronavirus outbreak - the vote may be overshadowed by the ongoing spread of Covid-19. So will it hurt turnout? There's good reason to think it won't: Washington is one of a handful of states thatconducts elections entirely by mail. All registered voters get a ballot sent to their address about two weeks before election day and they have two weeks to send it back in - meaning there are no polling places, door handles, or necessary physical contact. Still, Covid-19 hasn't been forgotten - officials have urged voters not to seal their envelopes with a lick. Because of all the postal votes to count, we might not get a result called from Washington state tonight. As results come in across six US states, Donald Trump's campaign released a statement calling Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders ""two sides of the same coin"". ""The Democrat candidate for president will be
running on a big government socialist agenda regardless of the name on the
ballot."" ""Either way, President Trump is on an unstoppable drive toward
re-election.â As expected, Trump has won the Republican contests in Mississippi, Missouri and Michigan. Technically, he is not the official Republican candidate until it is announced at the convention. Â© 2025 BBC.

"The giraffes lived in an unfenced conservancy Two extremely rare white giraffes have been killed by poachers in north-eastern Kenya, conservationists say. Rangers had found the carcasses of the female and her calf in a village in north-eastern Kenya's Garissa County. A third white giraffe is still alive. It is thought to be the only remaining one in the world, the conservationists added. Their white appearance is due to a rare condition called leucism, which causes skin cells to have no pigmentation. News of the white giraffes spread across the world after they were photographed in 2017. Africa Live: Updates on this and other stories Giraffes given greater protection Giraffes added to vulnerable list The manager of the Ishaqbini Hirola Community Conservancy, Mohammed Ahmednoor, said the two killed giraffes were last spotted more than three months ago. ""This is a very sad day for the community of Ijara and Kenya as a whole. We are the only community in the world who are custodians of the white giraffe,"" Mr Ahmednoor said in a statement. ""Its killing is a blow to the tremendous steps taken by the community to conserve rare and unique species and a wake-up call for continued support to conservation efforts,"" he added. The poachers have not yet been identified, and their motive is still unclear. The Kenya Wildlife Society, the main conservation body in the East African state, said it was investigating the killings. What is leucism? Leucism inhibits pigmentation in some skin cells It is different to albinism where no melanin is produced at all Animals with leucism may have darker pigment in their soft tissue Giraffes with leucism retain their dark eyes, whereas animals with albinism have pink eyes Birds, lions, fish, peacocks, penguins, eagles, hippos, moose and snakes have all displayed traits of leucism The conservancy is in a vast unfenced area. There are also villages within the conservancy. White giraffes were first spotted in Kenya in March 2016,external, about two months after a sighting in neighbouring Tanzania, the conservancy says on its website. Some 40% of the giraffe population has disappeared in the last 30 years and poaching for meat and skin continues,according to the Africa Wildlife Foundation,external. The population went from around 155,000 in 1985 to 97,000 in 2015, according to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN).

"Residents of New Rochelle have been taking precautions New York's governor has announced that troops will be sent into a town not far from Manhattan in an attempt to contain the spread of the coronavirus. The National Guard will deliver food to some individuals told to isolate in New Rochelle. Though the city is not under quarantine, a one-mile (1.6km) ""containment zone"" will be enforced. The area has seen ""the largest cluster"" of US cases, Andrew Cuomo said as he announced the measures on Tuesday. There are more than 1,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the US so far. New York state has 173 active cases, the most in the US, and 108 of them are in Westchester County where New Rochelle is located. China - where the virus was first detected - has seen a total of 80,754 confirmed cases and 3,136 deaths.But it recorded its lowest number of new infections, just 19, on Tuesday. In other developments: A UK health minister, Nadine Dorries, said she had tested positivefor coronavirus and was self-isolating at home Music festivals and other major events, including Coachellafestival in California, were cancelled or postponed Thousands of flights were cancelledworldwide as airlines struggled to cope with a slump in demand EASY STEPS:What can I do?

MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash New York City has 36 confirmed cases of the virus. But New Rochelle, which has a population of just 77,000, is believed to have at least twice as many. ""[It's] a particular problem,"" Mr Cuomo said. ""It's a phenomenon."" A synagogue is reported to be at the centre of the New Rochelle outbreak and around 1,000 people associated with the temple are now in quarantine. Mr Cuomo announced a string of measures on Tuesday afternoon in a bid to quell the spread of the virus in the area. He said the ""dramatic action"" was a ""matter of life and death"". Schools, gathering places and businesses in the virus hot spot will be closed for two weeks. Officials will also set up a coronavirus testing facility at a local hospital. The National Guard will be deployed to help clean schools and public spaces as well as deliver food to the individuals quarantined. But Mr Cuomo stressed there would be no travel restrictions in the town. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo says travel is not restricted in and out of the city Twenty-nine people have died in the country as a result of the virus - 24 in Washington state, two in California, two in Florida and one in New Jersey. The director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr Anthony Fauci, urged Americans to start taking the risk of infection seriously. ""We would like the country to realise that as a nation, we can't be doing the kinds of things we were doing a few months ago,"" he said at a White House briefing. Senior Republicans self-quarantine over virus Coachella music festival postponed Concerns deepened amid the sharp rise in the number of cases reported in the first week of March. Infections were disclosed in New York, Washington, New Jersey and Tennessee in quick succession. High medical costs make the virus particularly problematic - many Americans avoid doctor's visits because of unaffordable charges. A lack of paid sick leave is another concern, as are fears about the number of available tests. But Vice-President Mike Pence, who is in charge of the task force co-ordinating the response to the crisis, has said that ""any American can be tested, no restrictions, subject to doctor's orders"". This video can not be played Trump says he would get tested for coronavirus Meanwhile, President Donald Trump said he had been told he did not need a coronavirus test after appearing at a conference last month that was attended by an infected individual. Five senior Republicans, including Mark Meadows - the president's newly appointed chief of staff - announced they would be self-quarantining after interacting with the unidentified person. Mr Trump and some of his fellow Republicans have been accused of racism for referring to the disease as the ""China Virus"" and the ""Wuhan virus"". The disease was widely referred to by those terms after it was first reported in China in December But US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Robert Redfield told a congressional hearing on Tuesday that it was wrong to refer to the virus as Chinese. Analysis by Natalie Sherman, BBC Business, New York Economists say the coronavirus outbreak presents the greatest risk to the US economy in more than a decade, but for now it is not clear whether the tools being mobilised are up to the task. Spurred on by plunging financial markets, the president has promised relief, proposing a payroll tax cut which would reduce the amount of money deducted from worker pay cheques to pay for social programmes. A bit of extra cash in people's pockets could help boost confidence but economists say much more needs to be done. They have called for paid sick leave, relief for state health programmes, loan deferrals and money mailed directly to families, among other stimuli. For now, even Mr Trump's fellow Republicans seem unconvinced a payroll tax cut is the most effective response. As Jay Shambaugh, director of the Hamilton Project at the Brookings Institution, told me: ""If we don't do enoughâ¦ there's going to be unnecessary pain in the economy that we know ways to prevent."" Italy is one of the countries worst hit by the virus, and deaths there rose to 631 on Tuesday as the authorities placed the whole country in lockdown. The latest increase in deaths - 168 - is the biggest the country has recorded in a single day. The total number of cases in Italy now sits at 10,149. This video can not be played What life looks like under Italy's coronavirus lockdown Also on Tuesday, French President Emmanuel Macron described the spread of the virus in Europe as an ""exceptional crisis which required an exceptional response"". He said France was ""just at the beginning"" of its outbreak. Mr Macron was speaking after a video conference of European Union leaders in which they discussed the crisis. ""We will use all the tools at our disposal to make sure that the European economy weathers this storm,"" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said following the conference. Turkey also confirmed its first case, saying one of its citizens had been infected in ""Europe"" and his family members were now under observation. In the UK, the number of cases reached 373as a sixth person was confirmed to have died. Coachella music festival delayed amid virus fears How can I tell if I've got Covid?

"The government has defeated the first rebellion from its own MPs over plans to allow Huawei to be used in the UK's 5G mobile network. Thirty-eight Conservative rebels backed an amendment to end the Chinese firm's participation in the project by the start of 2023. Despite promises from the government of a new bill to address their concerns, rebel MPs pushed their plan to a vote. But with a large Commons majority, the government defeated it by 24 votes. Culture Minister Matt Warman said the government had heard the points ""loud and clear"". He added: ""We will now engage intensively with colleagues across the House to make sure that we will make our case at every possible levelâ¦and we will underline that we will always put national security at the very top of our agenda."" China warns of Huawei 5G 'witch-hunt' What is Huawei and how could it be a security threat? Huawei 5G verdict is decision 'with few good options' The use of Huawei technology in the 5G network was signed off by No 10 and security experts earlier this year, with the caveats of keeping the kit out of the most sensitive areas and capping its market share at 35%. But Tory critics say the firm is an arm of the Chinese state and a risk to UK security - claims the firm rejects. Other countries, including the US and Australia, have banned Huawei from their own networks and criticised the UK's decision. After the Commons vote, Huawei vice president Victor Zhang, said: ""An evidence-based approach is needed, so we were disappointed to hear some groundless accusations asserted. ""The industry and experts agree that banning Huawei equipment would leave Britain less secure, less productive and less innovative."" Today's revolt on Huawei leaves Boris Johnson with one king-sized political headache. It will likely prompt a bout of teeth gnashing in Downing Street that so many Tories should be ready to defy the PM so soon after he delivered them a whopping election victory. But it will also sting that their ranks were made up of some of the most senior Tory MPs, including a solid block of former cabinet ministers. In other words, these are not the sort of MPs who No 10 might expect to be able to bully back into line. And this matters because the rebellion could pave the way for an even bigger one in the summer that could yet overturn the Huawei decision, with several Tory MPs making clear they are ready to join the rebels once the key 5G legislation comes back to the Commons. A defeat for Mr Johnson over such a high profile issue would be a deeply wounding blow - all the more so since he went out on a limb to give his personal go-ahead to Huawei despite the fury of the White House and other allies. Time perhaps for the PM to root out the paracetamol. A group of Tory MPs, led by the party's former leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith, put forward an amendment to the Telecommunications Infrastructure Bill to try and stop Huawei's involvement. The amendment would have seen firms classified as ""high-risk vendors"" by the National Cyber Security Centre be banned entirely from the UK's 5G project by 31 December 2022. Sir Iain said he and his colleagues were ""genuinely concerned that this country has got itself far too bound in to a process in which we are reliant on untrusted vendors"". Speaking in the Commons, the backbencher accused the Chinese government of spending 20 years ""underbidding"" other technology firms until Huawei dominated the market, and the outcome was a risk to the UK's security. He said using Huawei's technology was a ""statement of absence of thought by any government"", adding: ""If defence of the realm is our number one priority, then this becomes demi-defence of the realm, and I am simply not prepared to put up with that."" This video can not be played IDS warns UK ""in thrall"" to untrusted telecoms providers Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden tried to reassure the group of backbenchers with the promise of bringing forward a Telecoms Security Bill before the summer recess ""so all honourable members will be able to debate these points extensively"". He also said the government wanted to work with itsFive Eyes security partners- including the US - on alternative solutions so the UK could ""get to a position where we do not have to use high-risk vendors at all"". But Mr Dowden could not give a timetable for the exclusion of such companies, except to say it would be ""in this Parliament"" - meaning within the next five years. As a result, Sir Iain pushed his amendment to a vote, marking the first Tory rebellion against the government since Boris Johnson won the election in December. However, while 282 MPs from across the House voted in favour of the amendment, 306 MPs voted against, defeating it. There were 38 Conservative MPs who rebelled against their government by voting for the amendment - including former international trade secretary Liam Fox, ex-Brexit secretary David Davis and former housing minister Esther McVey. Conservative MP and Foreign Affairs Committee chairman, Tom Tugendhat, also voted in favour of the amendment, saying he did ""not get the commitments"" he wanted from the government. ""I am sorry that I could not support the government. I hope the policy will change before we come to the main Telecoms Security Bill before the summer.""

"Checks began on Tuesday at the Brenner Pass between Italy and Austria Austria has banned people entering the country from Italy unless they carry a medical certificate, in an attempt to stop coronavirus spreading. Speaking after the Italian government imposed travel restrictions across the country, Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said Austrians returning from Italy would have to self-isolate for two weeks. Austria has seen 158 cases of coronavirus so far. By contrast, Italy has had more than 10,000 cases and 631 deaths. The number of cases in Italy continues to rise and 168 more fatalities over the previous 24 hours were announced on Tuesday evening. Health officials said 8,514 people were currently infected, a rise of 529, while a further 1,004 had now recovered. Mr Kurz said the number of cases in Austria was still very low, but the disease was deadly. Austria and Italy share a border north of Italy's South Tyrol region. On Tuesday, South Tyrol, in common with the rest of Italy, closed all cultural centres and restricted access to bars and cafes to daytime hours. Italy's nationwide lockdown limits travel to those with ""verifiable work requirements or situations of necessity"". All sporting events have been suspended, and schools and universities have been shut until 3 April. Employees have been urged either to work from home or take annual leave. Hotel and tourist accommodation operators in South Tyrol have ended their winter holiday season early and agreed to delay the spring tourist season.

Five mobile teams began health checks on the Brenner Pass as well as two other routes between the two countries on Tuesday. Austria is introducing further restrictions. University teaching is being suspended, as well as indoor events involving more than 100 people and outdoor events with more than 500. ""The fewer social contacts there are, the better prepared the hospitals will be,"" said Mr Kurz. The health minister said Austrians had to change their lives for the next few months. Many of Italy's cities were described as quiet on Tuesday. Bars and restaurants in Rome were open but there were few tourists around. Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte has urged Italians to stay at home, and the effect on the nation's cultural life has been immediate. Gyms, cinemas, swimming pools and schools have closed, and the Serie A football championship has ground to a halt, but public transport is still operating. In a decision that appeared to go against the grain of the Italian measures, Pope Francis urged Catholic priests to visit people infected by the virus. ""May they accompany healthcare professionals, volunteers in the work they are doing,"" he said during a Mass for visiting clergy at the Vatican. The virus is most deadly for Italy's elderly, according to figures from coronavirus emergency commissioner Angelo Borelli, who said the latest fatalities involved people already suffering from other illnesses. Seventy-seven were aged 70-89, while just 10% were aged 50-69. The remainder were over 90.

EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? GETTING READY:How prepared is the UK? MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak TRAVEL PLANS:What are your rights? Earlier, Dr Harries said the vast majority of those diagnosed with coronavirus in Britain are ""pretty well"" but that they may ""feel a bit rough for a few days"". She told BBC Breakfast new government measures could follow as UK cases begin to rise rapidly over the next two weeks. She added that people with flu-like symptoms will be advised to self-isolate within 10 to 14 days and, at the same time, significant increases in the number of cases are likely to begin. Dr Harries said cancelling big outdoor events like football matches would not necessarily be a decision supported by science. ""The virus will not survive very long outside,"" she said. ""Many outdoor events, particularly, are relatively safe."" In other developments: The UK Foreign Office warned Britons against all but essential travel to Italyafter the country extended its coronavirus measures,including travel restrictions Italian tourists have been told to self-isolate on arrival in Britain as several UK airlines cancelled flights to and from Italian airports The owner of Nottingham Forest FC, Evangelos Marinakis,has tested positiveafter returning from Greece Royal Bank of Scotland said it would allow customers to defer mortgage payments if needed The NHS partnered with technology firms to help promote official health advice online And new research showed that, on average, it took five daysfor people to show symptoms of the virus Italy's extended quarantine measures require residents to stay home, seek permission for essential travel, and justify leaving the country. On Sunday, a 60-year-old man from Greater Manchester became the third person to die after contracting coronavirus after recently visiting northern Italy. The son said his father fell ill ""instantly"" after returning to the UK at the end of February. He turned up at a local health centre for a routine appointment and, when he said he had been to Italy, ""panic broke out"". His father was taken to North Manchester General Hospital and the rest of the family were told to self-isolate - with Public Health England sending daily texts asking if they are showing symptoms. ""Since we cannot go outside we regularly called the ward where he was ill,""the man's son told BBC Bengali.""And on a daily basis and we asked them how he was. They did not allow me to speak to him directly. The son said his father - who had underlying conditions - was ""healthy"" by his own standards ""The first couple of days he was fairly stable but after that they were saying his blood was not oxygenated enough. Also his heartbeat was not stable either."" The son said they received a phone call from the hospital saying his father - who had underlying conditions including arthritis, heart problems, and cholesterol -  had died. ""Obviously I could not believe it because two months ago this thing didn't even exist and today it took away my father. ""It took me quite a long time to process the whole thing that I'm not going to be able to see him anymore."" British Airways has cancelled all of its flights to and from Italy until 4 April, and has asked staff to take voluntary unpaid leave. Ryanair will cancel all its flights to and from Italy from Saturday until 8 April, while Easyjet cancelled the majority of its flights to and from the country and Jet2 cancelled its Italian routes until 26 April. BA said customers due to fly to or from Italy before 4 April can rebook to a later date until the end of May, move their destination to Geneva or Zurich, or receive a full refund. A Foreign Office spokesman said: ""The advice is that anyone who arrives from Italy subsequent to the Italian government decision should now self-isolate for 14 days."" Downing Street said Italians arriving in the UK were being given the same advice as Britons to self-isolate and that the government had facilities available to accommodate them. Meanwhile airline Norwegian, which operates from several UK airports, said it was cutting 3,000 flights and reducing staff numbers after a fall in demand it attributed to coronavirus. This video can not be played Steps the NHS says you should take to protect yourself from Covid-19 The NHS has unveiled a range of measures as part of its response to try to stop fake news being spread about coronavirus on the internet. Searches for ""coronavirus"" on Google, Facebook and YouTube will now promote information from the National Health Service or the World Health Organization. The NHS saidit had worked with Twitter to take down an account claiming to be a hospital and spreading false information, while it is also speaking out against homeopaths promoting false treatments online. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the actions meant the public could access accurate health information ""which is more crucial than ever as we continue our response to coronavirus"". All of Italy placed under coronavirus lockdown UK supermarket delivery hours extended Unit set up to counter false coronavirus claims The UK is currently in the first phase - ""containment"" - ofthe government's four-part plan,external. Asked about statutory sick pay for workers who are not currently eligible, Health Secretary Matt Hancock told MPs that ""whatever the status of people"" who are employed, the government will ""ensure that they will get the support so they're not penalised for doing the right thing"". On Monday, health officials said people who showed ""even minor"" signs of respiratory tract infections or a fever would - within the next 14 days - be told to self-isolate for a week in an effort to tackle the outbreak. The UK government has also announced it is to extend shop delivery hoursto ensure that supermarkets have basic items, amid stockpiling concerns. The environment department, Defra, said by allowing night-time deliveries - currently restricted to avoid disturbing locals - stock would be able to move more quickly from warehouses to shelves.

"Checks began on Tuesday at the Brenner Pass between Italy and Austria Austria has banned people entering the country from Italy unless they carry a medical certificate, in an attempt to stop coronavirus spreading. Speaking after the Italian government imposed travel restrictions across the country, Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said Austrians returning from Italy would have to self-isolate for two weeks. Austria has seen 158 cases of coronavirus so far. By contrast, Italy has had more than 10,000 cases and 631 deaths. The number of cases in Italy continues to rise and 168 more fatalities over the previous 24 hours were announced on Tuesday evening. Health officials said 8,514 people were currently infected, a rise of 529, while a further 1,004 had now recovered. Mr Kurz said the number of cases in Austria was still very low, but the disease was deadly. Austria and Italy share a border north of Italy's South Tyrol region. On Tuesday, South Tyrol, in common with the rest of Italy, closed all cultural centres and restricted access to bars and cafes to daytime hours. Italy's nationwide lockdown limits travel to those with ""verifiable work requirements or situations of necessity"". All sporting events have been suspended, and schools and universities have been shut until 3 April. Employees have been urged either to work from home or take annual leave. Hotel and tourist accommodation operators in South Tyrol have ended their winter holiday season early and agreed to delay the spring tourist season.

Bavaria will ban events involving more than 1,000 people Denmark has recommended avoiding public transport during the rush hour and banned flights from northern Italy, part of Austria, Iran and areas of South Korea and China Czech schools will shut from Wednesday and authorities are looking for dozens of customers of a Czech Uber driver who tested positive for the virus 'People are paranoid' - Life on lockdown in Italy In pictures: Life under lockdown in Italy As well as barring Italians from entering the country, ""regarding Austrians in Italy, we are currently organising a repatriation of these Austrians"", Mr Kurz told reporters in Vienna. Five mobile teams began health checks on the Brenner Pass as well as two other routes between the two countries on Tuesday. Austria is introducing further restrictions. University teaching is being suspended, as well as indoor events involving more than 100 people and outdoor events with more than 500. ""The fewer social contacts there are, the better prepared the hospitals will be,"" said Mr Kurz. The health minister said Austrians had to change their lives for the next few months. Many of Italy's cities were described as quiet on Tuesday. Bars and restaurants in Rome were open but there were few tourists around. Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte has urged Italians to stay at home, and the effect on the nation's cultural life has been immediate. Gyms, cinemas, swimming pools and schools have closed, and the Serie A football championship has ground to a halt, but public transport is still operating. In a decision that appeared to go against the grain of the Italian measures, Pope Francis urged Catholic priests to visit people infected by the virus. ""May they accompany healthcare professionals, volunteers in the work they are doing,"" he said during a Mass for visiting clergy at the Vatican. The virus is most deadly for Italy's elderly, according to figures from coronavirus emergency commissioner Angelo Borelli, who said the latest fatalities involved people already suffering from other illnesses. Seventy-seven were aged 70-89, while just 10% were aged 50-69. The remainder were over 90.

Meanwhile,airlines have cutthousands of flights including to and from Italy after the country was put on lockdown. And GPs are warning routine appointments at surgeries may have to stop as the number of coronavirus cases rises. The British Medical Associationsaid routine monitoring of long-term health conditions might have to stopto enable GPs to ""focus on the sickest patients"". Earlier, England's deputy chief medical officer defended the decision to delay closing schools and introducing other stringent measures, saying experts were assessing new cases on an hourly basis to achieve a ""balanced response"". Dr Jenny Harries saidshe expected significant increases in the number of cases in the UK beginning in about 10 to 14 days time, at which point people with flu-like symptoms would be advised to self-isolate.

Meanwhile, the UK Foreign Office has warned Britons against all but essential travel to Italy, which is experiencing the worst outbreak outside China,after it introduced strict travel restrictions. Italians are being told to stay home, seek permission for essential travel, and give justification if they want to leave the country. The Foreign Office is advising anyone arriving in the UK from Italy since Monday evening to self-isolate for 14 days. The government says it has facilities to accommodate Italian visitors to the UK who need to self-isolate. British Airways has cancelled all of its flights to and from Italy until 4 April, and has asked staff to take voluntary unpaid leave.

"The tiny forest in Witney is said to be the first of its kind in the UK A ""tiny forest"" - said to be the first of its kind in the UK - is being planted in Oxfordshire in a bid to tackle urban wildlife loss. Six-hundred native trees will fill a 200-sq-m plot - about the size of a tennis court - in Witney, Oxfordshire. The small, fast-growing and dense forest, planted by environmental charity Earthwatch and Witney Town Council, will mimic native woodland. The charity said plans were already under way to create another in Oxford. Tiny forests are based on forest management methods developed in the 1970s by Japanese botanist Dr Akira Miyawaki. The trees, which are being planted by council staff and volunteers, are able to store carbon, soak up water to reduce flooding, attract wildlife, reduce dust, improve air quality and cut noise pollution. Earthwatch is bringing the scheme to the UK with the help of Dutch organisation IVN Nature Education, which has planted nearly 100 tiny forests in the Netherlands. Earthwatch Europe's senior research lead, Victor Beumer, said: ""We are excited to be planting a tiny forest, the first of its kind in the UK, in partnership with Witney Town Council. ""At a time when it seems impossible to overcome the enormous challenge of the climate and ecological crisis, tiny forests offer a collaborative natural solution with far-reaching benefits.

"Railways will be among the infrastructure to see a boost in funding after Wednesday's budget The government will promise to raise infrastructure spending to its highest in decades in Wednesday's Budget. It will pledge to triple the average net investment made over the last 40 years into rail and road, affordable housing, broadband and research. The Treasury told the BBC it would lead to the ""highest levels [of investment] in real terms since 1955"" - more than Â£600bn over the five-year Parliament. Chancellor Rishi Sunak will present the Budget less than a month into the job. It comes as the government faces calls for increased investment in a number of sectors to help tackle the coronavrius outbreak. On Sunday, Mr Sunak told the BBC's Andrew Marrthe NHS would get ""whatever resources it needs"" during the crisis. The chancellor also said he was looking at extra financial help for individuals and businesses if measures against the virus meant they were out of pocket. Budget 2020: The economy must be vaccinated Your essential guide to the Budget Government to pledge billions for filling potholes The BBC understands Mr Sunak will promise a gross amount of over Â£600bn for capital spending - money put into projects like roads and rail - by the middle of 2025. The chancellor said: ""We have listened and will now deliver on our promise to level up the UK, ensuring everyone has the same chances and opportunities in life, wherever they live. ""By investing historic amounts in British innovation and world-class infrastructure, we will rebalance opportunities and lay the foundations for a decade of growth for everybody."" BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the decision marked a significant increase in the amount of spending on capital projects compared to the period since Margaret Thatcher came to power in 1979. However, she said it was not yet clear if the government would stick to its own fiscal rules set out in its manifesto. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said the plans were ""exaggerated claims"". He added: ""We've heard it all before. ""The Chancellor seems to have forgotten we have to dig ourselves out of the Â£192bn hole in our infrastructure spend created by his government. ""Boris Johnson has a track record of boastful claims followed by non delivery and it looks like he is running true to form."" If you wondered what the government's new buzz phrase of ""levelling up"" was meant to mean, the Conservatives will try to provide the answer tomorrow. In his first budget, the Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, will commit to the biggest increase on spending on capital - roads, rail, research - that there has been in generations. He's expected to promise to sign a hypothetical cheque of more than Â£600bn of gross public sector investment, to be cashed by the middle of 2025, we understand. And the Treasury tonight claims it will push public investment in real terms to levels not seen since 1955. But it's wise to be careful with the historical claims. The economy is totally different to that era. Read more from Laura here. The government is also set to pledgeÂ£2.5bn to fixing potholes in Englandas part of the Budget. The Treasury said the funding package would also be available to local authorities to start resurfacing works, preventing potholes from appearing in the first place. But Mr McDonnell said the policy was part of a ""gimmicky grab-bag of projects"".

"Taxpayer-owned bank RBS will allow people affected by the coronavirus outbreak to defer mortgage and loan repayments for up to three months. TSB and Lloyds said they would also allow a mortgage window, and the banks said savers could close fixed-term savings accounts without charge. This is designed to allow people to access cash if they need it as the impact of the virus is felt. Banks are also announcing extra support for affected businesses. Cases of mortgage repayment holidays are being taken on a case-by-case basis, and the length of any suspension can vary between banks. Other support for individuals facing financial difficulties owing to the virus includes: Refunds on credit card cash advance fees The option of applying for an temporarily increased credit card borrowing limit Asking for an increased cash withdrawal limit of up to Â£500 The measures are similar to those already in place for people facing financial difficulties. ""We understand that there may be circumstances where a personal customer may fall into financial difficulty as a result of the impacts of coronavirus, for instance, loss of income,"" a spokesman for RBS said. ""We will look to understand each customer's situation on a case-by-case basis and can offer a number of options to help them manage their finances."" UK Finance, which represents the major banks, said that all banks would consider increasing overdrafts or allowing repayment relief for loan or mortgage repayments for those affected by the virus. ""We would encourage customers who think they may be affected to contact their provider as soon as possible to discuss the support available to them,"" said its chief executive, Stephen Jones. Offering to let personal customers put off paying the mortgage for three months is inherently un-commercial - the sort of thing that would seriously damage your credit record if you did it without agreement. Similarly offering to convert capital repayment loans into interest-only loans for up to a year will cost the banks money. Because they are expensive, the measures raise practical questions - above all, how will the banks establish that customers are truly affected by the virus rather than other factors? A doctor's letter? They haven't answered that question yet. Before taking up any such help, customers, business or personal, would be wise to get it in writing from the bank that it won't harm their credit records. Changes to mortgage agreements in some way mirror the situation in Italy, one of the areas most affected by the outbreak. With significant restrictions on the population in place, Laura Castelli, Italy's deputy economy minister, saidmortgage payments would be suspendedacross Italy. RBS said on Monday that it was offering more flexibility over loans to businesses. LIVE:Follow the latest updates EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? GETTING READY:How prepared is the UK? MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak Other banks are following suit. Barclays said it was offering 12-month capital repayment holidays on existing loans over Â£25,000, and would also offer extended or new overdraft facilities to business customers. ""Our network of relationship managers has been reaching out to SMEs across the UK to see if they require additional support during this time, as we do regularly when we see any events which may have an impact on our clients,"" said Ian Rand, chief executive of Barclays Business Banking. ""Barclays is ready to help, whether that is with managing cash-flow or any other support, and we encourage any customer who needs guidance to call us or contact their relationship manager."" Lloyds Banking Group said it would be open to requests from small businesses for overdraft extensions and other support.

"The newly identified Omicron variant of Covid has led to more disruption for international travellers. Quarantine is being reintroduced for people arriving from some African countries, flights have been cancelled and PCR tests will be mandatory within 48 hours of arrival to the UK from 30 November. If the government announces that travel to a particular country is not advised, then airlines and travel companies are likely to cancel any pre-booked flights or holidays there. For example, that is already the case for some flights to and from South Africa as a result of risks associated with the Omicron variant. What are the UK's new travel rules? If your flight is cancelled, you are entitled to a full refund and you can choose to receive that refund in cash rather than as a voucher. An airline should refund the money within seven days, although some people have waited longer. A package holiday should be refunded, in full, within 14 days. This is far less clear-cut. If you cancel, rather than your travel provider, then you have no automatic right to a refund. In this situation, it is worth contacting the airline/holiday provider to see what options you have. EasyJet, for example, has announced that it will extend its ""freedom to change"" service - which allows passengers to change flights up to two hours before departure for free  - until 31 March, 2022. Some may charge a fee to transfer to another date or destination, but some may allow it without charging a fee. You would have to pay the difference if the alternative flight is more expensive. They may give you a voucher, or they may allow you to cancel and get a refund. That may be trickier, according to Rory Boland, travel editor at Which? who said that the property's specific policy will determine whether refunds would be given. ""If your trip is several weeks or months away, travellers should at this stage do nothing as the situation may change,"" he said. ""Those booking a trip should do so through holiday providers with good, flexible booking policies in case it cannot go ahead."" People who have booked a package holiday will be refunded in full, including accommodation, if it is cancelled by the operator. Operators do not have to refund you if you are unexpectedly forced to self-isolate. It is best to study their policies before booking, or see whether they can offer some support if you have already booked and want to cancel. Travel insurers are offering different levels of cover. In part, this depends on how much you pay for a policy. The majority, but not all, will pay out if you test positive for Covid and have to cancel before you travel. Importantly, if the Foreign Office advises against travel to a country - as it is for some in southern Africa at the moment, then all but a handful of travel insurance policies would be invalid if you still decide to go. Rules are inevitably going to be complex, given the risk of Covid varies so much between countries. The government haspublished a charter,externalthat ""clearly sets out consumer rights and responsibilities when booking travel while Covid-19 measures remain in place"". It says it expects travel operators to be ""flexible"" with customers, given the circumstances, and theCompetition and Markets Authority (CMA) has warned package holiday firmsthey must stick to refund rules. â¨ How are travel rules being relaxed?

"The man was in isolation at North Manchester General Hospital A coronavirus patient died in quarantine before his family got to say goodbye, his son has said. The 60-year-old man, the third person with the virus to die in the UK, had recently returned from Italy. He was put in isolation at North Manchester General Hospital after a visit to his GP, but died five days later. His son told the BBC relatives, who have been advised to self-isolate, were unable to schedule a funeral. ""When they broke the news to me that he passed away - obviously I could not believe it,"", the man's son said. ""We all burst into tears. ""I can't express how it feels to know that I won't be able to see him again,"" he added. ""Two months ago, this thing didn't even exist and now it took away my father."" The son, who does not want to be named, said ""panic broke out"" when his father turned up for a regular check-up at his GP's surgery wearing a mask.

He told staff he'd been on a two-week holiday in Italy where the family used to live and returned on 29 February for his scheduled appointment. The 60-year-old, who is originally from Bangladesh, suffered from cholesterol, arthritis, heart problems, liver problems and shortness of breath. He was immediately put into isolation and his family advised to quarantine themselves. ""The first couple of days, he was fairly stable but after that they were saying his blood was not oxygenated enough,"" said his son. ""Since we cannot go outside, we regularly called the ward and we asked daily how he was. They did not allow me to speak to him directly."" He said the family receive daily texts from Public Health England asking if they are showing signs of the virus. ""So farâ¦ none of us have shown any symptoms,"" he added.

"The mansion at The Bishops Avenue is the family home of Nurali Aliyev The BBC has won a challenge to identify a London mansion at the heart of the latest Unexplained Wealth Order (UWO). The property is the family home of one of the members of Kazakhstan's political elite, Nurali Aliyev. The home on The Bishops Avenue, Hampstead - known as ""Billionaires' Row"" - is owned by offshore companies. It is one of three homes worth more than Â£80m owned for the benefit of Mr Aliyev and his leading Kazakh politician mother, Dariga Nazarbayeva. The National Crime Agency suspects all three of the mega properties in London were bought with riches embezzled by Mr Aliyev's notorious and now dead father. Rakhat Aliyev once styled himself ""Godfather-in-law"" and was accused of crimes including murder, before his own death in prison. Mr Aliyev and Dr Nazarbayeva have denied all wrongdoing - saying they can prove independent and legitimate wealth for their UK property investments. Mr Aliyev's late father, Rakhat, wrote a book in 2009 Unexplained Wealth Orders are one of the UK's newest tools in the fight against suspected criminal money invested in property. National Crime Agency investigators can use UWOs to require owners to disclose how they managed to buy a luxury home. If they do not agree with the explanation, they can then ask the courts to confiscate it. Super-apartment: Chelsea development in this building worth up to Â£40m A high security mansion at 33 The Bishops Avenue - one of the most expensive roads in Britain. The 10-bedroom home has an underground pool, ""tropical showers"", a glass domed roof, a dedicated cinema and separate quarters for staff A mega apartment in a luxury secure development at 21 Manresa Road, Chelsea, constructed following a multi-million pound merger of two already enormous flats Another secure mansion at 32 Denewood Road, Highgate, a private cul-de-sac with views over one of London's most exclusive golf clubs The properties were identified in an investigation by BBC News,Finance Uncovered,externalandTransparency International,externalinto the ownership of London property by members of Kazakhstan's political elite. Each of the homes is owned by companies incorporated in three tax havens - Panama, Anguilla and Curacao in the Caribbean. The properties' fate will be decided in a major court battle that began at the High Court on Tuesday. Dr Nazarbayeva with The Queen and Prince Andrew in 2015 Mr Aliyev describes himself as a tech entrepreneur and investor. His grandfather, Nursultan Nazarbayev, was president of the oil and gas-rich nation for three decades. Former president Nazarbayev's daughter, Dr Dariga Nazarbayeva, married Rakhat Aliyev. The opera-singing multi-lingual former business woman is now the chair of Kazakhstan's senate - and is tipped to possibly become president of Kazakhstan in the future. Rakhat Aliyev, her ex-husband, was once a senior figure in the government. However, he fell out with the president, split from his wife and was accused of major crimes - driving him into de facto exile. In 2015 Rakhat Aliyev was found dead in an Austrian prison cell. He had apparently killed himself while awaiting trial for the alleged murder of two bankers in Kazakhstan. Denewood: Third massive property under NCA scrutiny Court papers show that the National Crime Agency suspects that Rakhat Aliyev and members of his family were involved in serious crime in Kazakhstan. ""I suspect that Rakhat Aliyev has been involved in... bribery, corruption, blackmail, conspiracy to defraud, forgery and money laundering,"" says a statement from an investigator. ""I also believe that members of his family - including Nurali Aliyev - have been involved in money laundering."" The NCA says the companies that own the properties in London are part of a pattern of ""extreme secrecy"" to hide assets. In statements on Tuesday morning, the mother and son said they wanted to swiftly clear their names and were frustrated with how the NCA had targeted them. They both say they had no contact with Rakhat after the family split. Clare Montgomery QC, lawyer for some of the companies that own the properties, told the court that the NCA's case was ""tissue thin"". She said Mrs Nazarbayeva had offered clearly to answer the NCA's questions by providing proof of her own independent finances and wealth - and the details of how her acrimonious and public split from her late husband showed she had nothing to do with his criminality. Conservationist: Mr Aliyev campaigning for snow leopards She accused the NCA of ""an absurdly patriarchal view of the world"". Instead, she argued, ""there is a woman who is economically active throughout the period who might just have conceivably earned her own money."" The family and lawyers say they gave the NCA detailed evidence of how Dr Nazarbayeva managed her wealth and organised their ownership of homes in a tax efficient manner. ""The NCA has refused to engage with the material that has been provided,"" Ms Montgomery told the court. ""They insist that the application is made in court, in public, for reasons that do not reflect well on their ability to review the decisions they have made in this case.""

"The government has defeated the first rebellion from its own MPs over plans to allow Huawei to be used in the UK's 5G mobile network. Thirty-eight Conservative rebels backed an amendment to end the Chinese firm's participation in the project by the start of 2023. Despite promises from the government of a new bill to address their concerns, rebel MPs pushed their plan to a vote. But with a large Commons majority, the government defeated it by 24 votes. Culture Minister Matt Warman said the government had heard the points ""loud and clear"". He added: ""We will now engage intensively with colleagues across the House to make sure that we will make our case at every possible levelâ¦and we will underline that we will always put national security at the very top of our agenda."" China warns of Huawei 5G 'witch-hunt' What is Huawei and how could it be a security threat? Huawei 5G verdict is decision 'with few good options' The use of Huawei technology in the 5G network was signed off by No 10 and security experts earlier this year, with the caveats of keeping the kit out of the most sensitive areas and capping its market share at 35%. But Tory critics say the firm is an arm of the Chinese state and a risk to UK security - claims the firm rejects. Other countries, including the US and Australia, have banned Huawei from their own networks and criticised the UK's decision. After the Commons vote, Huawei vice president Victor Zhang, said: ""An evidence-based approach is needed, so we were disappointed to hear some groundless accusations asserted. ""The industry and experts agree that banning Huawei equipment would leave Britain less secure, less productive and less innovative."" Today's revolt on Huawei leaves Boris Johnson with one king-sized political headache. It will likely prompt a bout of teeth gnashing in Downing Street that so many Tories should be ready to defy the PM so soon after he delivered them a whopping election victory. But it will also sting that their ranks were made up of some of the most senior Tory MPs, including a solid block of former cabinet ministers. In other words, these are not the sort of MPs who No 10 might expect to be able to bully back into line. And this matters because the rebellion could pave the way for an even bigger one in the summer that could yet overturn the Huawei decision, with several Tory MPs making clear they are ready to join the rebels once the key 5G legislation comes back to the Commons. A defeat for Mr Johnson over such a high profile issue would be a deeply wounding blow - all the more so since he went out on a limb to give his personal go-ahead to Huawei despite the fury of the White House and other allies. Time perhaps for the PM to root out the paracetamol. A group of Tory MPs, led by the party's former leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith, put forward an amendment to the Telecommunications Infrastructure Bill to try and stop Huawei's involvement. The amendment would have seen firms classified as ""high-risk vendors"" by the National Cyber Security Centre be banned entirely from the UK's 5G project by 31 December 2022. Sir Iain said he and his colleagues were ""genuinely concerned that this country has got itself far too bound in to a process in which we are reliant on untrusted vendors"". Speaking in the Commons, the backbencher accused the Chinese government of spending 20 years ""underbidding"" other technology firms until Huawei dominated the market, and the outcome was a risk to the UK's security. He said using Huawei's technology was a ""statement of absence of thought by any government"", adding: ""If defence of the realm is our number one priority, then this becomes demi-defence of the realm, and I am simply not prepared to put up with that."" This video can not be played IDS warns UK ""in thrall"" to untrusted telecoms providers Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden tried to reassure the group of backbenchers with the promise of bringing forward a Telecoms Security Bill before the summer recess ""so all honourable members will be able to debate these points extensively"". He also said the government wanted to work with itsFive Eyes security partners- including the US - on alternative solutions so the UK could ""get to a position where we do not have to use high-risk vendors at all"". But Mr Dowden could not give a timetable for the exclusion of such companies, except to say it would be ""in this Parliament"" - meaning within the next five years. As a result, Sir Iain pushed his amendment to a vote, marking the first Tory rebellion against the government since Boris Johnson won the election in December. However, while 282 MPs from across the House voted in favour of the amendment, 306 MPs voted against, defeating it. There were 38 Conservative MPs who rebelled against their government by voting for the amendment - including former international trade secretary Liam Fox, ex-Brexit secretary David Davis and former housing minister Esther McVey. Conservative MP and Foreign Affairs Committee chairman, Tom Tugendhat, also voted in favour of the amendment, saying he did ""not get the commitments"" he wanted from the government. ""I am sorry that I could not support the government. I hope the policy will change before we come to the main Telecoms Security Bill before the summer."" The Telecommunications Infrastructure Bill later passed without needing a vote. China warns of Huawei 5G 'witch-hunt' What is Huawei and what threat does it pose?

"A cleaner sanitises an empty classroom in Turin At the San Cosimato playground in Rome, parents have that unmistakeable look of ""how on Earth am I going to entertain them?"" The perennial problem has struck early this year: with schools and universities now closed across Italy until at least 15 March, in an effort to contain the spread of coronavirus, some 8.4 million children are out of class well before the Easter break. It's an unprecedented response by Europe's worst-hit country. Malvina Diletti watches her eight-year-old, Edoardo, play on the climbing frame. ""We think 10 days off is totally useless, it's not even enough to discover if you're sick,"" she says. ""So they'll probably extend it, which is bad as it's tiring to have them home all the time. They may be happy today - it's the first day - but they'll get bored eventually."" They are heading home for lunch with six other children, as parents are taking it in turn to host, sharing the babysitting load during this difficult period. ""It's so we avoid grandparents having to stay with us,"" Malvina tells me, ""because if more elderly got sick, hospitals would just crash."" On Thursday the Italian authorities reported 41 deaths from the virus in the past 24 hours, raising the total death toll to 148 in Italy. Currently 3,296 people are infected in the country. This was the first country in Europe to ban all flights to China; the first to cordon off entire towns; and now it's the first to close all schools and universities, a dramatic effort to limit a worsening outbreak. ""Maybe they've done it to protect the older teachers,"" says Malvina, ""since the children are still mixing out of school. ""It doesn't really make sense - but we accept it and will do it for the community."" Edoardo says he's enjoying being off school, ""but it's strange because it's the first time"". I ask if he understands why it's happening. ""Yes,"" he replies, ""it's to stop us getting sick."" LATEST:Live coverage of developments EASY STEPS:What can I do? A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms?

In the northern town of Busto Arsizio, part of the region worst hit by the virus, the Tosi High School is using web-learning to stream classes. ""Our lessons continue uninterrupted,"" says Amanda Ferrario, the headteacher. ""The teacher enters a virtual classroom, does the roll call and can see students connected on their devices. They can work in groups, make presentations and show videos."" The school is part of a network, Ashoka Changemakers, whose investment in the resource is paying off. ""This could be a turning point in Italian education,"" she says, ""and a chance to create innovative methods. ""Other schools may struggle because perhaps their teachers aren't trained. We're supporting those that ask for our help, as there are very few like us."" Some schools are recording entire lessons on WhatsApp, while others are incorporating the news into their lessons, one teacher telling an Italian newspaper that she'd asked pupils to come up with stories about ""the monster of coronavirus"". She added that ""facing coronavirus helps overcome fear"". Rome in crisis: A pedestrian area near St Peter's Square is almost deserted Italians are adjusting to the crisis - but the reality is hitting hard. And while there doesn't appear to be panic about the spread of cases itself, there is deepening concern about the economic impact. At the Royal Santina Hotel beside Rome's Termini Station, just 20 of the 120 rooms are occupied, and 90% of bookings for March have been cancelled. The corridors feel eerily quiet. ""This is the worst I've seen in my 35 years here,"" says owner Giuseppe Roscioli. ""It's the first time that we've lost almost all the international market - from the US, Asia and the Middle East - as well as the domestic market from Italian tourists and group bookings."" What will happen if the situation continues? ""I have the key - I can lock the door,"" he says. Empty shelves in a Milan shop: The scare has triggered some panic-buying Italy's tourism sector is now predicted to lose â¬7.4bn (Â£6.4bn; $8.3bn) as a result of the outbreak. From the Colosseum to the Trevi Fountain, Rome's must-see sights are being seen by so few. ""I thought it would be fuller than it is,"" says Jill Saunderson from the UK, while enjoying St Peter's Square. ""All the waiters we've spoken to are petrified for their livelihoods. We wanted to come - we're quite healthy and we think there's a lot of scaremongering going on."" Health, the economy, even Italians' way of life: all are now facing an unparalleled challenge. There is shock here at seeing how vulnerable this economy is to events beyond Italy's control. And for many the most damaging thing is not knowing when this uncertainty will pass.

"Rebecca Evans: ""We are ready for this and it is important that funding is based on need"" Emergency aid to tackle coronavirus should be based on the demands of Wales' older population, the Welsh Government's finance minister has said. It follows a meeting Rebecca Evans held with UK Chief Secretary to the Treasury Stephen Barclay ahead of the budget. She also said the number of Welsh manufacturing jobs means many people will not be able to work from home. The budget, on Wednesday, is expected to be dominated by dealing with the immense challenges of the outbreak. Calm returns to markets after share turmoil Should we expect a coronavirus Budget? Budget: 'First-time buyers need more help' Ms Evans joined her counterparts from the UK's other devolved governments in the meeting with Mr Barclay, in Westminster, on Tuesday. After the talks, she told BBC Wales she looked forward to learning what steps to deal with coronavirus were being introduced by Chancellor Rishi Sunak in his first budget. ""We are working really well across governments,"" she said. ""This is a real challenge but it is an issue we are prepared for. ""We are ready for this and it is important that funding is based on need. ""We have a very large proportion of older people in Wales, more manufacturing jobs in Wales and all of that needs to be taken into consideration."" EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? GETTING READY:How prepared is the UK? MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak TRAVEL PLANS:What are your rights? The minister said she hoped there would be measures to give businesses longer to pay taxes as consequence of coronavirus and ensure swift payments for those claiming Universal Credit. She also stressed the need for extra UK government funding to help communities hit by the recent floods. Mr Sunak has insisted UK ministers will take ""whatever action is required"" to deal with the Covid-19 outbreak. Stephen Barclay is the chancellor's deputy at the Treasury Meanwhile the Treasury has confirmed the broadcaster S4C will be allowed to claim back VAT on costs incurred from 2021 - putting it back on the same tax footing as ITN (Independent Television News) and the BBC. S4C's tax status was changed in 2019, requiring it to pay VAT on costs. The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport at the time agreed to foot the bill in Westminster until the rules were changed so that S4C would again be allowed to recover its VAT payments. The Wales Office estimates that, had S4C been required to foot the bill itself, it would have cost S4C up to Â£15m a year - and S4C has welcomed the announcement saying it would have amounted to a 20% cut in its budget.

"The decision to delay closing schools and introduce other strict measures to combat coronavirus has been defended by England's deputy chief medical officer. Dr Jenny Harries said experts are assessing new cases on an hourly basis to achieve a ""balanced response"". It comes as a man in his early 80s became the sixth person with the virus to die in the UK. Meanwhile, manyairlines cutthousands of flights, including to and from Italy, in the wake of the outbreak. According to the latest figures, there were373 confirmed cases as of 09:00 GMT,externalon Tuesday. Of them, 324 are in England. Northern Irelandannounced,externalfour more cases, bringing its total to 16, and Scotlandconfirmed another,externalfour cases, increasing its number to 27. The latest death happened on Monday evening and was a man with underlying health conditions who was being looked after at Watford General Hospital, the West Hertfordshire Hospitals NHS Trust said. He caught the virus in the UK and officials are trying to trace who he was in contact with, the country's chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty said. EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? GETTING READY:How prepared is the UK? MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak TRAVEL PLANS:What are your rights? Earlier, Dr Harries said the vast majority of those diagnosed with coronavirus in Britain are ""pretty well"" but that they may ""feel a bit rough for a few days"". She told BBC Breakfast new government measures could follow as UK cases begin to rise rapidly over the next two weeks. She added that people with flu-like symptoms will be advised to self-isolate within 10 to 14 days and, at the same time, significant increases in the number of cases are likely to begin. Dr Harries said cancelling big outdoor events like football matches would not necessarily be a decision supported by science. ""The virus will not survive very long outside,"" she said. ""Many outdoor events, particularly, are relatively safe."" In other developments: The UK Foreign Office warned Britons against all but essential travel to Italyafter the country extended its coronavirus measures,including travel restrictions Italian tourists have been told to self-isolate on arrival in Britain as several UK airlines cancelled flights to and from Italian airports The owner of Nottingham Forest FC, Evangelos Marinakis,has tested positiveafter returning from Greece Royal Bank of Scotland said it would allow customers to defer mortgage payments if needed The NHS partnered with technology firms to help promote official health advice online And new research showed that, on average, it took five daysfor people to show symptoms of the virus Italy's extended quarantine measures require residents to stay home, seek permission for essential travel, and justify leaving the country. On Sunday, a 60-year-old man from Greater Manchester became the third person to die after contracting coronavirus after recently visiting northern Italy. The son said his father fell ill ""instantly"" after returning to the UK at the end of February. He turned up at a local health centre for a routine appointment and, when he said he had been to Italy, ""panic broke out"". His father was taken to North Manchester General Hospital and the rest of the family were told to self-isolate - with Public Health England sending daily texts asking if they are showing symptoms. ""Since we cannot go outside we regularly called the ward where he was ill,""the man's son told BBC Bengali.""And on a daily basis and we asked them how he was. They did not allow me to speak to him directly. The son said his father - who had underlying conditions - was ""healthy"" by his own standards ""The first couple of days he was fairly stable but after that they were saying his blood was not oxygenated enough. Also his heartbeat was not stable either."" The son said they received a phone call from the hospital saying his father - who had underlying conditions including arthritis, heart problems, and cholesterol -  had died. ""Obviously I could not believe it because two months ago this thing didn't even exist and today it took away my father. ""It took me quite a long time to process the whole thing that I'm not going to be able to see him anymore."" British Airways has cancelled all of its flights to and from Italy until 4 April, and has asked staff to take voluntary unpaid leave. Ryanair will cancel all its flights to and from Italy from Saturday until 8 April, while Easyjet cancelled the majority of its flights to and from the country and Jet2 cancelled its Italian routes until 26 April. BA said customers due to fly to or from Italy before 4 April can rebook to a later date until the end of May, move their destination to Geneva or Zurich, or receive a full refund. A Foreign Office spokesman said: ""The advice is that anyone who arrives from Italy subsequent to the Italian government decision should now self-isolate for 14 days."" Downing Street said Italians arriving in the UK were being given the same advice as Britons to self-isolate and that the government had facilities available to accommodate them. Meanwhile airline Norwegian, which operates from several UK airports, said it was cutting 3,000 flights and reducing staff numbers after a fall in demand it attributed to coronavirus. This video can not be played Steps the NHS says you should take to protect yourself from Covid-19 The NHS has unveiled a range of measures as part of its response to try to stop fake news being spread about coronavirus on the internet. Searches for ""coronavirus"" on Google, Facebook and YouTube will now promote information from the National Health Service or the World Health Organization. The NHS saidit had worked with Twitter to take down an account claiming to be a hospital and spreading false information, while it is also speaking out against homeopaths promoting false treatments online. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the actions meant the public could access accurate health information ""which is more crucial than ever as we continue our response to coronavirus"". All of Italy placed under coronavirus lockdown UK supermarket delivery hours extended Unit set up to counter false coronavirus claims The UK is currently in the first phase - ""containment"" - ofthe government's four-part plan,external. Asked about statutory sick pay for workers who are not currently eligible, Health Secretary Matt Hancock told MPs that ""whatever the status of people"" who are employed, the government will ""ensure that they will get the support so they're not penalised for doing the right thing"". On Monday, health officials said people who showed ""even minor"" signs of respiratory tract infections or a fever would - within the next 14 days - be told to self-isolate for a week in an effort to tackle the outbreak. The UK government has also announced it is to extend shop delivery hoursto ensure that supermarkets have basic items, amid stockpiling concerns. The environment department, Defra, said by allowing night-time deliveries - currently restricted to avoid disturbing locals - stock would be able to move more quickly from warehouses to shelves.

There were 142 British people on the ship, whichspent five days stranded off the coastof California. However, one of the Britons on board, Jackie Bissell, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme she had yet to hear from the ship's captain about her departure. ""They haven't said anything about when we can go,"" she said. ""It's very unnerving to be left out here when we don't know what's going to happen."" What's the risk on public transport? Can you stop people stockpiling? Coronavirus symptoms 'take five days to show' Elsewhere, crowds exceeding 60,000 are expected on all four days of horse racing's Cheltenham Festival, which starts on Tuesday afternoon. It comes after Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said there was no reason to cancel such events due to coronavirus, although many other sporting fixtures,including the Six NationsandFormula One, have been affected.

"Checks began on Tuesday at the Brenner Pass between Italy and Austria Austria has banned people entering the country from Italy unless they carry a medical certificate, in an attempt to stop coronavirus spreading. Speaking after the Italian government imposed travel restrictions across the country, Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said Austrians returning from Italy would have to self-isolate for two weeks. Austria has seen 158 cases of coronavirus so far. By contrast, Italy has had more than 10,000 cases and 631 deaths. The number of cases in Italy continues to rise and 168 more fatalities over the previous 24 hours were announced on Tuesday evening. Health officials said 8,514 people were currently infected, a rise of 529, while a further 1,004 had now recovered. Mr Kurz said the number of cases in Austria was still very low, but the disease was deadly. Austria and Italy share a border north of Italy's South Tyrol region. On Tuesday, South Tyrol, in common with the rest of Italy, closed all cultural centres and restricted access to bars and cafes to daytime hours. Italy's nationwide lockdown limits travel to those with ""verifiable work requirements or situations of necessity"". All sporting events have been suspended, and schools and universities have been shut until 3 April. Employees have been urged either to work from home or take annual leave. Hotel and tourist accommodation operators in South Tyrol have ended their winter holiday season early and agreed to delay the spring tourist season.

Five mobile teams began health checks on the Brenner Pass as well as two other routes between the two countries on Tuesday. Austria is introducing further restrictions. University teaching is being suspended, as well as indoor events involving more than 100 people and outdoor events with more than 500. ""The fewer social contacts there are, the better prepared the hospitals will be,"" said Mr Kurz. The health minister said Austrians had to change their lives for the next few months. Many of Italy's cities were described as quiet on Tuesday. Bars and restaurants in Rome were open but there were few tourists around. Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte has urged Italians to stay at home, and the effect on the nation's cultural life has been immediate. Gyms, cinemas, swimming pools and schools have closed, and the Serie A football championship has ground to a halt, but public transport is still operating. In a decision that appeared to go against the grain of the Italian measures, Pope Francis urged Catholic priests to visit people infected by the virus. ""May they accompany healthcare professionals, volunteers in the work they are doing,"" he said during a Mass for visiting clergy at the Vatican. The virus is most deadly for Italy's elderly, according to figures from coronavirus emergency commissioner Angelo Borelli, who said the latest fatalities involved people already suffering from other illnesses. Seventy-seven were aged 70-89, while just 10% were aged 50-69. The remainder were over 90.

"The government has defeated the first rebellion from its own MPs over plans to allow Huawei to be used in the UK's 5G mobile network. Thirty-eight Conservative rebels backed an amendment to end the Chinese firm's participation in the project by the start of 2023. Despite promises from the government of a new bill to address their concerns, rebel MPs pushed their plan to a vote. But with a large Commons majority, the government defeated it by 24 votes. Culture Minister Matt Warman said the government had heard the points ""loud and clear"". He added: ""We will now engage intensively with colleagues across the House to make sure that we will make our case at every possible levelâ¦and we will underline that we will always put national security at the very top of our agenda."" China warns of Huawei 5G 'witch-hunt' What is Huawei and how could it be a security threat? Huawei 5G verdict is decision 'with few good options' The use of Huawei technology in the 5G network was signed off by No 10 and security experts earlier this year, with the caveats of keeping the kit out of the most sensitive areas and capping its market share at 35%. But Tory critics say the firm is an arm of the Chinese state and a risk to UK security - claims the firm rejects. Other countries, including the US and Australia, have banned Huawei from their own networks and criticised the UK's decision. After the Commons vote, Huawei vice president Victor Zhang, said: ""An evidence-based approach is needed, so we were disappointed to hear some groundless accusations asserted. ""The industry and experts agree that banning Huawei equipment would leave Britain less secure, less productive and less innovative."" Today's revolt on Huawei leaves Boris Johnson with one king-sized political headache. It will likely prompt a bout of teeth gnashing in Downing Street that so many Tories should be ready to defy the PM so soon after he delivered them a whopping election victory. But it will also sting that their ranks were made up of some of the most senior Tory MPs, including a solid block of former cabinet ministers. In other words, these are not the sort of MPs who No 10 might expect to be able to bully back into line. And this matters because the rebellion could pave the way for an even bigger one in the summer that could yet overturn the Huawei decision, with several Tory MPs making clear they are ready to join the rebels once the key 5G legislation comes back to the Commons. A defeat for Mr Johnson over such a high profile issue would be a deeply wounding blow - all the more so since he went out on a limb to give his personal go-ahead to Huawei despite the fury of the White House and other allies. Time perhaps for the PM to root out the paracetamol. A group of Tory MPs, led by the party's former leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith, put forward an amendment to the Telecommunications Infrastructure Bill to try and stop Huawei's involvement. The amendment would have seen firms classified as ""high-risk vendors"" by the National Cyber Security Centre be banned entirely from the UK's 5G project by 31 December 2022. Sir Iain said he and his colleagues were ""genuinely concerned that this country has got itself far too bound in to a process in which we are reliant on untrusted vendors"". Speaking in the Commons, the backbencher accused the Chinese government of spending 20 years ""underbidding"" other technology firms until Huawei dominated the market, and the outcome was a risk to the UK's security. He said using Huawei's technology was a ""statement of absence of thought by any government"", adding: ""If defence of the realm is our number one priority, then this becomes demi-defence of the realm, and I am simply not prepared to put up with that."" This video can not be played IDS warns UK ""in thrall"" to untrusted telecoms providers Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden tried to reassure the group of backbenchers with the promise of bringing forward a Telecoms Security Bill before the summer recess ""so all honourable members will be able to debate these points extensively"". He also said the government wanted to work with itsFive Eyes security partners- including the US - on alternative solutions so the UK could ""get to a position where we do not have to use high-risk vendors at all"". But Mr Dowden could not give a timetable for the exclusion of such companies, except to say it would be ""in this Parliament"" - meaning within the next five years. As a result, Sir Iain pushed his amendment to a vote, marking the first Tory rebellion against the government since Boris Johnson won the election in December. However, while 282 MPs from across the House voted in favour of the amendment, 306 MPs voted against, defeating it. There were 38 Conservative MPs who rebelled against their government by voting for the amendment - including former international trade secretary Liam Fox, ex-Brexit secretary David Davis and former housing minister Esther McVey. Conservative MP and Foreign Affairs Committee chairman, Tom Tugendhat, also voted in favour of the amendment, saying he did ""not get the commitments"" he wanted from the government. ""I am sorry that I could not support the government. I hope the policy will change before we come to the main Telecoms Security Bill before the summer."" The Telecommunications Infrastructure Bill later passed without needing a vote. China warns of Huawei 5G 'witch-hunt' What is Huawei and what threat does it pose?

"This video can not be played Italians queued at supermarkets after the nationwide lockdown was announced Italy has extended its emergency coronavirus measures, which include travel restrictions and a ban on public gatherings, to the entire country. On Monday, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte ordered people to stay home and seek permission for essential travel. He said the measures were designed to protect the most vulnerable. ""There is no more time,"" he said in a TV address. Italy's coronavirus death toll jumped from 366 to 463 on Monday. It is the worst-hit country after China. The number of confirmed infection also increased by 24% from Sunday, official figures showed. Cases of the virus have been confirmed in all 20 Italian regions. Latest updates here Mr Conte said the best thing was for people to stay at home. ""We're having an important growth in infection... and of deaths,"" he said in an evening address. ""The whole of Italy will become a protected zone,"" he added. EASY STEPS:What can I do? A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? IMMUNITY:Are women and children less affected? MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:How to self isolate ""We all must give something up for the good of Italy. We have to do it now. ""This is why I decided to adopt even more strong and severe measures to contain the advance... and protect the health of all citizens."" 'Italy lockdown cut me off from my husband' In an earlier interview with La Repubblica newspaper, Mr Conte said of the outbreak: ""I have been thinking about the old speeches of [Winston] Churchill - it is our darkest hour, but we will make it"". Italians have been ordered to stay at home in an attempt to contain the spread of the virus Mr Conte described the measures as ""I stay home"" - with people forbidden to gather in public. ""No more nightlife; we can't allow this anymore since they are occasions for contagion,"" he said. All sporting events - including football matches - are suspended nationwide. Schools and universities will remain closed until 3 April. Coronavirus symptoms 'take five days to show' The government said only those with a valid work or family reason that cannot be postponed will be allowed to travel. Passengers departing on flights will have to justify themselves, as will all those who arrive by plane. There are controls at train stations to check the temperatures of passengers. Cruise ships are also forbidden to dock at various ports. Earlier on Monday, seven inmates died amid riots at prisons across the country after authorities suspended all visits as part of attempts to control the spread of the disease. The trouble began in the northern city of Modena at the Sant'Anna prison. It is thought that at least two of the dead lost their lives to drug overdoses after they raided a prison hospital for the heroin substitute methadone. Relatives of inmates at the Rebibbia prison in Rome protest at being denied entry At San Vittore prison in Milan, detainees set fire to a cell block, then climbed onto the roof through windows and started waving banners, officials said. At a prison in the southern city of Foggia, dozens of inmates broke out of the building during protests. Many were quickly recaptured, Italy's Ansa news agency reported. Nine are still missing. There were also riots at other prisons in northern Italy and at facilities in Naples and  Rome. Officers guard the entrance of the Sant'Anna prison in Modena as prisoners' relatives protest The number of infections worldwide is now more than 111,000, with about 3,890 deaths. Everyone arriving in Israel will be required to self-quarantinefor 14 days, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced. Iranhas reported 43 new deaths related to the disease in the past 24 hours.At least 237 people have died and 7,161 have been infectedacross the country since mid-February, although the real figures are believed to be far higher. China, which has recorded the highest number of fatalities, reported just 40 new cases of Covid-19, the lowest since 20 January. Although this indicates that the spread there is slowing, senior officials warned against reducing vigilance. In other developments: TheWorld Health Organization(WHO) has warned that the threat of a pandemic is ""very real"" Canadahas confirmed the first death related to the virus - an elderly male patient in a care home in Vancouver, British Columbia InFrance, Culture Minister Franck Riester has become the first member of the government to be infected with the virus.

"Rebecca Evans: ""We are ready for this and it is important that funding is based on need"" Emergency aid to tackle coronavirus should be based on the demands of Wales' older population, the Welsh Government's finance minister has said. It follows a meeting Rebecca Evans held with UK Chief Secretary to the Treasury Stephen Barclay ahead of the budget. She also said the number of Welsh manufacturing jobs means many people will not be able to work from home. The budget, on Wednesday, is expected to be dominated by dealing with the immense challenges of the outbreak. Calm returns to markets after share turmoil Should we expect a coronavirus Budget? Budget: 'First-time buyers need more help' Ms Evans joined her counterparts from the UK's other devolved governments in the meeting with Mr Barclay, in Westminster, on Tuesday. After the talks, she told BBC Wales she looked forward to learning what steps to deal with coronavirus were being introduced by Chancellor Rishi Sunak in his first budget. ""We are working really well across governments,"" she said. ""This is a real challenge but it is an issue we are prepared for. ""We are ready for this and it is important that funding is based on need. ""We have a very large proportion of older people in Wales, more manufacturing jobs in Wales and all of that needs to be taken into consideration."" EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? GETTING READY:How prepared is the UK? MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak TRAVEL PLANS:What are your rights? The minister said she hoped there would be measures to give businesses longer to pay taxes as consequence of coronavirus and ensure swift payments for those claiming Universal Credit. She also stressed the need for extra UK government funding to help communities hit by the recent floods. Mr Sunak has insisted UK ministers will take ""whatever action is required"" to deal with the Covid-19 outbreak. Stephen Barclay is the chancellor's deputy at the Treasury Meanwhile the Treasury has confirmed the broadcaster S4C will be allowed to claim back VAT on costs incurred from 2021 - putting it back on the same tax footing as ITN (Independent Television News) and the BBC. S4C's tax status was changed in 2019, requiring it to pay VAT on costs. The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport at the time agreed to foot the bill in Westminster until the rules were changed so that S4C would again be allowed to recover its VAT payments. The Wales Office estimates that, had S4C been required to foot the bill itself, it would have cost S4C up to Â£15m a year - and S4C has welcomed the announcement saying it would have amounted to a 20% cut in its budget.

"Taxpayer-owned bank RBS will allow people affected by the coronavirus outbreak to defer mortgage and loan repayments for up to three months. TSB and Lloyds said they would also allow a mortgage window, and the banks said savers could close fixed-term savings accounts without charge. This is designed to allow people to access cash if they need it as the impact of the virus is felt. Banks are also announcing extra support for affected businesses. Cases of mortgage repayment holidays are being taken on a case-by-case basis, and the length of any suspension can vary between banks. Other support for individuals facing financial difficulties owing to the virus includes: Refunds on credit card cash advance fees The option of applying for an temporarily increased credit card borrowing limit Asking for an increased cash withdrawal limit of up to Â£500 The measures are similar to those already in place for people facing financial difficulties. ""We understand that there may be circumstances where a personal customer may fall into financial difficulty as a result of the impacts of coronavirus, for instance, loss of income,"" a spokesman for RBS said. ""We will look to understand each customer's situation on a case-by-case basis and can offer a number of options to help them manage their finances."" UK Finance, which represents the major banks, said that all banks would consider increasing overdrafts or allowing repayment relief for loan or mortgage repayments for those affected by the virus. ""We would encourage customers who think they may be affected to contact their provider as soon as possible to discuss the support available to them,"" said its chief executive, Stephen Jones. Offering to let personal customers put off paying the mortgage for three months is inherently un-commercial - the sort of thing that would seriously damage your credit record if you did it without agreement. Similarly offering to convert capital repayment loans into interest-only loans for up to a year will cost the banks money. Because they are expensive, the measures raise practical questions - above all, how will the banks establish that customers are truly affected by the virus rather than other factors? A doctor's letter? They haven't answered that question yet. Before taking up any such help, customers, business or personal, would be wise to get it in writing from the bank that it won't harm their credit records. Changes to mortgage agreements in some way mirror the situation in Italy, one of the areas most affected by the outbreak. With significant restrictions on the population in place, Laura Castelli, Italy's deputy economy minister, saidmortgage payments would be suspendedacross Italy. RBS said on Monday that it was offering more flexibility over loans to businesses. LIVE:Follow the latest updates EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? GETTING READY:How prepared is the UK? MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak Other banks are following suit. Barclays said it was offering 12-month capital repayment holidays on existing loans over Â£25,000, and would also offer extended or new overdraft facilities to business customers. ""Our network of relationship managers has been reaching out to SMEs across the UK to see if they require additional support during this time, as we do regularly when we see any events which may have an impact on our clients,"" said Ian Rand, chief executive of Barclays Business Banking. ""Barclays is ready to help, whether that is with managing cash-flow or any other support, and we encourage any customer who needs guidance to call us or contact their relationship manager."" Lloyds Banking Group said it would be open to requests from small businesses for overdraft extensions and other support.

"The report says people will need to fly less The UK cannot go climate neutral much before 2050 unless people stop flying and eating red meat almost completely, a report says. But it warns that the British public do not look ready to take such steps and substantially change their lifestyle. The report challenges the views of campaign group Extinction Rebellion. It believes the UK target of climate neutrality by 2050 will result in harm to the climate. The claim comes from the government-funded research group Energy Systems Catapult, whose computer models are used by the Committee on Climate Change, which advises government. Its report says: ""A number of groups have called for net zero to be accelerated to 2025, 2030 or 2040. ""Achieving net zero significantly earlier than 2050 in our modelling exceeds even our most speculative measures, with rates of change for power, heat and road transport that push against the bounds of plausibility."" A really simple guide to climate change Big lifestyle changes 'needed to cut emissions' But the authors offer some optimism too. They calculate that the UKcancut emissions fast enough to be climate neutral by 2050 â but only if ministers act much more quickly. They say the government urgently needs to invest in three key technologies: carbon capture and storage with bioenergy crops; hydrogen for a wide variety of uses; and advanced nuclear power. The report modelled options for society to 2050. It concluded that if decisions are made early, the cost of climate neutrality can be held down to 1-2% of national wealth - GDP. Scenarios rely on some technologies still in their infancy, which will be controversial. For instance, it draws heavily on burning energy crops, capturing the carbon emissions and burying them underground. It says hydrogen use will need to grow to supply industry, heat and heavy transport. Electricity generation will need to double with heavy reliance on solar power and offshore wind.

Modular reactors are much smaller than conventional reactors, and brought to a site in a kit of parts to be assembled. It warns that livestock production for dairy and meat may need to be cut by 50% rather than the 20% currently envisaged by the Committee on Climate Change. And people will need to eat less meat and dairy by the same amount. The reportâs author, Scott Milne, said: âWhichever pathway the UK takes, innovation, investment and inducements across low-carbon technology, land use and lifestyle are essential to achieve net zero. Adopting new technologies, such as hydrogen energy, will be crucial ""And there are massive economic opportunities for the UK to lead the world in these areas."" However, the report warns that the public do not appear ready for substantial lifestyle changes. It warns, for instance, that if peopleâs homes are better insulated, they may choose to spend the same amount on heating to deliver a warmer home. It says: âEarly evidence suggests a general willingness to adopt new technologies (such as new heating or mobility) as long as these can deliver the same experiences as before. âConversely, approaching the subject of dietary change or aviation often elicits a more resistant and emotional response.â Some experts will be critical of the reportâs expectation that new technologies such as carbon capture and storage will be rapidly adopted. A recent report said it was unrealistic to expect that carbon capture and hydrogenwill develop fast enough to achieve the net zero target. A spokesperson for Extinction Rebellion told BBC News: ""The global response to coronavirus shows we can radically address crises if we put our minds to it. Meanwhile, the net zero date has not been put to the people of the UK. ""The science tells us that net zero by 2050 means a hell of a lot worse than giving up flying and red meat - people are dying now around the world as you read this due to governmental inaction."" The report was not welcomed by the National Beef Association. Its spokesman Neil Shand told BBC News that scientific studies typically underestimate the role of livestock in capturing carbon in the soil. He said: âIt does seem rather unfortunate that the report links beef production and aviation in this way. âThe timing is more than a little ironic; the shops are full of people panic-buying and it seems clear that the nationâs food sector relies very heavily on imports, and the associated transport that brings them into the UK. ""Food produced on their own doorstep, using a system where animal and non-animal foods are symbiotic requires very little air travel, and makes excellent use of the resources our beautiful country provides. Foreign travel does not have the same necessity."" In addition, a report from a group of environmentally-minded business leaders has called on the government to show increased ambition and delivery of carbon-cutting policies to get the UK on track to meet climate goals. It said there was an urgent need especially for policies to bring low-carbon heating to people's homes.

"Shares in the US enjoyed a late-afternoon boost on Tuesday as a rise in oil prices helped markets to recover some ground one day after the biggest falls since the 2008 financial crisis. The three main US indexes closed more than 4.9% higher. Earlier, shares in Europe slipped into negative territory, despite initial bounce-backs. London's FTSE 100 ended almost flat, after a 7.7% drop the day before. In France and Germany, the main indexes dropped more than 1.4%. Markets were battered on Mondayin reaction to the threat of an oil price war between Russia and Saudi Arabia. But after falling as much as 30% on Monday, oil prices rebounded slightly, with Brent crude more than 8% higher. Analysts said US markets were helped along by promises from the White House to take steps to protect the US economy against the impact of the coronavirus outbreak. ""Obviously there has been concern voiced in the market that this is not being contained and more needs to be done,"" said William Foster, vice president and lead US analyst for Moody's Investors Service. ""Now we're starting to see a response from the US federal government, the administration and Congress that. I think that's going to be part of the solution to supporting the economy... and ultimately stabilising the markets."" Earlier, shares in Japan rose after Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said his government would work closely with the central bank to boost the economy. Japan's benchmark index, the Nikkei 225, had started Tuesday more than 3% down but bounced back following Mr Abe's comments to end 1% higher. In Hong Kong, the main Hang Seng market rose 1.4% buoyed by Japan's moves to calm investors. The index had fallen more than 4% on Monday. London's FTSE index was 0.23% higher at the end of Tuesday at 5,979. The optimism on Tuesday was helped by a slowdown in reported cases of coronavirus in China, according to Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK. ""This optimism, along with expectations around further central bank actions is, for now, offsetting the news that the whole of Italy has gone into lockdown and the Spanish government has taken the decision to close all schools and universities in Madrid,"" he said. Monday saw the steepest declines in many global financial markets since the 2008 financial crisis. The major US stock indexes fell so sharply at the start of trading that the buying and selling of shares was halted for 15 minutes, as a so-called ""circuit breaker"" aimed at curbing panicky selling came into effect. The dramatic falls in response to fears over the impact of the coronavirus were typical of market behaviour, said Kathleen Brooks, director at Minerva Analysis. ""Markets are so emotional, it's unbelievable,"" she said. ""Act first, think later. This was the same in 2008, you have these massive declines and then the market is on pause."" Coronavirus: What are your travel rights? A problem unlike any Donald Trump has faced She said she thought markets would recover eventually, as ""if you look at long-term charts they always recover"". However, in the short term, ""we could see another decline if we don't see the stimulus that's required. We need to hear more positive things because that's when stock markets go up."" Many people's initial reaction to ""the markets"" is that they are not directly affected, because they do not invest money. Yet there are millions of people with a pension - either private or through work - who will see their savings (in what is known as a defined contribution pension) invested by pension schemes. The value of their savings pot is influenced by the performance of these investments. So big rises or falls can affect your pension, but the advice is to remember that pension savings, like any investments, are usually a long-term bet. Read more here. Major central banks have pledged to pump cash into the financial system while governments are mulling stimulus measures to tackle the economic hit. These include cuts to interest rates to encourage companies to borrow money and expand. However, former Bank of England governor Mervyn King told BBC 5 live'sWake Up to Money: ""I don't think that a cut in interest rates now is actually going to do a great deal to help the situation, it maybe a sign of reassurance but it is not more than that. ""What is needed now are targeted measures to help business deal with a short-term crisis and collapse of their cash flow, and I think the Bank of England understands that very well.""

"Jack Merritt was killed in the London Bridge attack last year The Prison Officers' Association has called for a ""fundamental review"" of the UK's de-radicalisation programmes. Dave Merritt, father of London Bridge attack victim Jack Merritt, toldBBC Radio 4's File on 4that ""something was going wrong"" with the current system. His son's attacker, the convicted terrorist Usman Khan, previously took part intwo Home Office de-radicalisation programmes. The government said it had ""tough measures"" to tackle prison extremism. But Sudesh Amman, who injured passers-by in a knife attack in Streatham in Februaryis reported to have refused to engage,externalwith attempts to turn him away from violence. And Mark Fairhurst, national chair of the POA, said those who did take part in government schemes may be going ""through the motions"" to ""make us think that they've conformed and rehabilitated themselves and de-radicalised"". How do you deradicalise someone? Why was Usman Khan released from prison? The government said that, between January 2013 and December 2019, only 3% of offenders convicted under terrorism laws went on to commit a further terror offence. The latest government figures show that there are 224 prisoners in British jails who have been convicted of terrorist offences, around three quarters of whom are associated with Islamist extremism. Around 60 terror offenders are currently being managed by probation services in England and Wales. Armed police at the scene of the London Bridge attack Many prisoners will be offered Health Identity Intervention (HII), a programme developed with psychologists and prison staff, and introduced into prisons over the last decade. This is supplemented by the Desistance and Disengagement Programme (DDP), which can be offered to both prisoners and those released on licence. According to the Home Office, it is ""part psychological, part ideological, part theological"". These schemes have been criticised because London Bridge attacker Khan participated in both HII and DDP, yet went on to launch the attack at London Bridge less than a year after his release from prison for plotting terrorist attacks. Neither the HII nor the DDP courses have undergone any formal evaluation process. A short-term outcome evaluation of the HII is underway and will end next year. Mr Merritt said the Streatham and London Bridge attacks indicated that ""something was going wrong"". He added: ""Something is clearly not working if people are being let out and going on very soon afterwards to commit serious offences. ""One thing we are keen to point out is that longer sentences in themselves are not a solution to anything because those prisoners will be released eventually. ""I think the important thing is that steps are taken to address their offending while they're in prison."" Mark Fairhurst of the Prison Officers' Association Mr Fairhurst added: ""The question has to be asked, are we dealing now with a different dynamic? ""Are we dealing with people who are effectively sleeper cells who go through the motions, who make us think that they've conformed and rehabilitated themselves and de-radicalised? ""I would say it's very easy to fake anything in a prison. We need stricter guidelines. let's not play games with people's lives."" He called for a ""fundamental review"" of these rehabilitation schemes. Since the Streatham attack, the government has introduced emergency legislation that will ensure offenders convicted of terrorist offences will now have to serve at least two thirds of their sentence,  before being eligible for a Parole Board assessment. Independent Reviewer of Terrorism Legislation Jonathan Hall QC told File on 4 he was concerned by additional, proposed legislation forcing ""the most dangerous extremist prisoners"" to serve the full length of their sentence without any possibility of parole. He said: ""Someone will go into prison having committed a very serious offence and say to themselves, 'I've got no reason to admit my offending to address the risk factors', and come out after 12 years, perhaps as dangerous as when they went in. ""I'm hoping that the government will think again about those possible consequences."" The government said: ""Robust supervision or monitoring arrangements will be in place for all offenders upon release. ""We have tough and world-leading measures in place to prevent extremist prisoners from spreading their poisonous ideology and do not hesitate to take action when needed. ""This work is led by a nationwide network of counter-terrorism specialists embedded throughout the prison and probation service, while 29,000 staff have received enhanced training to spot the signs of extremism."" File on 4's Extreme Measures: Can Extremists be De-radicalised? is on BBC Radio 4 on Tuesday 10 March at 20:00and available afterwards on BBC Sounds.

"The decision to delay closing schools and introduce other strict measures to combat coronavirus has been defended by England's deputy chief medical officer. Dr Jenny Harries said experts are assessing new cases on an hourly basis to achieve a ""balanced response"". It comes as a man in his early 80s became the sixth person with the virus to die in the UK. Meanwhile, manyairlines cutthousands of flights, including to and from Italy, in the wake of the outbreak. According to the latest figures, there were373 confirmed cases as of 09:00 GMT,externalon Tuesday. Of them, 324 are in England. Northern Irelandannounced,externalfour more cases, bringing its total to 16, and Scotlandconfirmed another,externalfour cases, increasing its number to 27. The latest death happened on Monday evening and was a man with underlying health conditions who was being looked after at Watford General Hospital, the West Hertfordshire Hospitals NHS Trust said. He caught the virus in the UK and officials are trying to trace who he was in contact with, the country's chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty said. EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? GETTING READY:How prepared is the UK? MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak TRAVEL PLANS:What are your rights? Earlier, Dr Harries said the vast majority of those diagnosed with coronavirus in Britain are ""pretty well"" but that they may ""feel a bit rough for a few days"". She told BBC Breakfast new government measures could follow as UK cases begin to rise rapidly over the next two weeks. She added that people with flu-like symptoms will be advised to self-isolate within 10 to 14 days and, at the same time, significant increases in the number of cases are likely to begin. Dr Harries said cancelling big outdoor events like football matches would not necessarily be a decision supported by science. ""The virus will not survive very long outside,"" she said. ""Many outdoor events, particularly, are relatively safe."" In other developments: The UK Foreign Office warned Britons against all but essential travel to Italyafter the country extended its coronavirus measures,including travel restrictions Italian tourists have been told to self-isolate on arrival in Britain as several UK airlines cancelled flights to and from Italian airports The owner of Nottingham Forest FC, Evangelos Marinakis,has tested positiveafter returning from Greece Royal Bank of Scotland said it would allow customers to defer mortgage payments if needed The NHS partnered with technology firms to help promote official health advice online And new research showed that, on average, it took five daysfor people to show symptoms of the virus Italy's extended quarantine measures require residents to stay home, seek permission for essential travel, and justify leaving the country. On Sunday, a 60-year-old man from Greater Manchester became the third person to die after contracting coronavirus after recently visiting northern Italy. The son said his father fell ill ""instantly"" after returning to the UK at the end of February. He turned up at a local health centre for a routine appointment and, when he said he had been to Italy, ""panic broke out"". His father was taken to North Manchester General Hospital and the rest of the family were told to self-isolate - with Public Health England sending daily texts asking if they are showing symptoms. ""Since we cannot go outside we regularly called the ward where he was ill,""the man's son told BBC Bengali.""And on a daily basis and we asked them how he was. They did not allow me to speak to him directly. The son said his father - who had underlying conditions - was ""healthy"" by his own standards ""The first couple of days he was fairly stable but after that they were saying his blood was not oxygenated enough. Also his heartbeat was not stable either."" The son said they received a phone call from the hospital saying his father - who had underlying conditions including arthritis, heart problems, and cholesterol -  had died. ""Obviously I could not believe it because two months ago this thing didn't even exist and today it took away my father. ""It took me quite a long time to process the whole thing that I'm not going to be able to see him anymore."" British Airways has cancelled all of its flights to and from Italy until 4 April, and has asked staff to take voluntary unpaid leave. Ryanair will cancel all its flights to and from Italy from Saturday until 8 April, while Easyjet cancelled the majority of its flights to and from the country and Jet2 cancelled its Italian routes until 26 April. BA said customers due to fly to or from Italy before 4 April can rebook to a later date until the end of May, move their destination to Geneva or Zurich, or receive a full refund. A Foreign Office spokesman said: ""The advice is that anyone who arrives from Italy subsequent to the Italian government decision should now self-isolate for 14 days."" Downing Street said Italians arriving in the UK were being given the same advice as Britons to self-isolate and that the government had facilities available to accommodate them. Meanwhile airline Norwegian, which operates from several UK airports, said it was cutting 3,000 flights and reducing staff numbers after a fall in demand it attributed to coronavirus. This video can not be played Steps the NHS says you should take to protect yourself from Covid-19 The NHS has unveiled a range of measures as part of its response to try to stop fake news being spread about coronavirus on the internet. Searches for ""coronavirus"" on Google, Facebook and YouTube will now promote information from the National Health Service or the World Health Organization. The NHS saidit had worked with Twitter to take down an account claiming to be a hospital and spreading false information, while it is also speaking out against homeopaths promoting false treatments online. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the actions meant the public could access accurate health information ""which is more crucial than ever as we continue our response to coronavirus"". All of Italy placed under coronavirus lockdown UK supermarket delivery hours extended Unit set up to counter false coronavirus claims The UK is currently in the first phase - ""containment"" - ofthe government's four-part plan,external. Asked about statutory sick pay for workers who are not currently eligible, Health Secretary Matt Hancock told MPs that ""whatever the status of people"" who are employed, the government will ""ensure that they will get the support so they're not penalised for doing the right thing"". On Monday, health officials said people who showed ""even minor"" signs of respiratory tract infections or a fever would - within the next 14 days - be told to self-isolate for a week in an effort to tackle the outbreak. The UK government has also announced it is to extend shop delivery hoursto ensure that supermarkets have basic items, amid stockpiling concerns. The environment department, Defra, said by allowing night-time deliveries - currently restricted to avoid disturbing locals - stock would be able to move more quickly from warehouses to shelves.

There were 142 British people on the ship, whichspent five days stranded off the coastof California. However, one of the Britons on board, Jackie Bissell, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme she had yet to hear from the ship's captain about her departure. ""They haven't said anything about when we can go,"" she said. ""It's very unnerving to be left out here when we don't know what's going to happen."" What's the risk on public transport?

"The report says people will need to fly less The UK cannot go climate neutral much before 2050 unless people stop flying and eating red meat almost completely, a report says. But it warns that the British public do not look ready to take such steps and substantially change their lifestyle. The report challenges the views of campaign group Extinction Rebellion. It believes the UK target of climate neutrality by 2050 will result in harm to the climate. The claim comes from the government-funded research group Energy Systems Catapult, whose computer models are used by the Committee on Climate Change, which advises government. Its report says: ""A number of groups have called for net zero to be accelerated to 2025, 2030 or 2040. ""Achieving net zero significantly earlier than 2050 in our modelling exceeds even our most speculative measures, with rates of change for power, heat and road transport that push against the bounds of plausibility."" A really simple guide to climate change Big lifestyle changes 'needed to cut emissions' But the authors offer some optimism too. They calculate that the UKcancut emissions fast enough to be climate neutral by 2050 â but only if ministers act much more quickly. They say the government urgently needs to invest in three key technologies: carbon capture and storage with bioenergy crops; hydrogen for a wide variety of uses; and advanced nuclear power. The report modelled options for society to 2050. It concluded that if decisions are made early, the cost of climate neutrality can be held down to 1-2% of national wealth - GDP. Scenarios rely on some technologies still in their infancy, which will be controversial. For instance, it draws heavily on burning energy crops, capturing the carbon emissions and burying them underground. It says hydrogen use will need to grow to supply industry, heat and heavy transport. Electricity generation will need to double with heavy reliance on solar power and offshore wind. GRETA THUNBERG:What does she want? A TO Z:Climate-related words and phrases explained YOUR HOME:How much warmer is your city?,external FOOD:What is your diet's carbon footprint? IN CHARTS:How warm has the world got? Controversially, it calls forsmall, modular nuclear reactorsto support three-quarters of heating in cities through district heating systems. Modular reactors are much smaller than conventional reactors, and brought to a site in a kit of parts to be assembled. It warns that livestock production for dairy and meat may need to be cut by 50% rather than the 20% currently envisaged by the Committee on Climate Change. And people will need to eat less meat and dairy by the same amount. The reportâs author, Scott Milne, said: âWhichever pathway the UK takes, innovation, investment and inducements across low-carbon technology, land use and lifestyle are essential to achieve net zero. Adopting new technologies, such as hydrogen energy, will be crucial ""And there are massive economic opportunities for the UK to lead the world in these areas."" However, the report warns that the public do not appear ready for substantial lifestyle changes. It warns, for instance, that if peopleâs homes are better insulated, they may choose to spend the same amount on heating to deliver a warmer home. It says: âEarly evidence suggests a general willingness to adopt new technologies (such as new heating or mobility) as long as these can deliver the same experiences as before. âConversely, approaching the subject of dietary change or aviation often elicits a more resistant and emotional response.â Some experts will be critical of the reportâs expectation that new technologies such as carbon capture and storage will be rapidly adopted. A recent report said it was unrealistic to expect that carbon capture and hydrogenwill develop fast enough to achieve the net zero target. A spokesperson for Extinction Rebellion told BBC News: ""The global response to coronavirus shows we can radically address crises if we put our minds to it. Meanwhile, the net zero date has not been put to the people of the UK. ""The science tells us that net zero by 2050 means a hell of a lot worse than giving up flying and red meat - people are dying now around the world as you read this due to governmental inaction."" The report was not welcomed by the National Beef Association. Its spokesman Neil Shand told BBC News that scientific studies typically underestimate the role of livestock in capturing carbon in the soil. He said: âIt does seem rather unfortunate that the report links beef production and aviation in this way. âThe timing is more than a little ironic; the shops are full of people panic-buying and it seems clear that the nationâs food sector relies very heavily on imports, and the associated transport that brings them into the UK. ""Food produced on their own doorstep, using a system where animal and non-animal foods are symbiotic requires very little air travel, and makes excellent use of the resources our beautiful country provides. Foreign travel does not have the same necessity."" In addition, a report from a group of environmentally-minded business leaders has called on the government to show increased ambition and delivery of carbon-cutting policies to get the UK on track to meet climate goals. It said there was an urgent need especially for policies to bring low-carbon heating to people's homes.

"The government has defeated the first rebellion from its own MPs over plans to allow Huawei to be used in the UK's 5G mobile network. Thirty-eight Conservative rebels backed an amendment to end the Chinese firm's participation in the project by the start of 2023. Despite promises from the government of a new bill to address their concerns, rebel MPs pushed their plan to a vote. But with a large Commons majority, the government defeated it by 24 votes. Culture Minister Matt Warman said the government had heard the points ""loud and clear"". He added: ""We will now engage intensively with colleagues across the House to make sure that we will make our case at every possible levelâ¦and we will underline that we will always put national security at the very top of our agenda."" China warns of Huawei 5G 'witch-hunt' What is Huawei and how could it be a security threat? Huawei 5G verdict is decision 'with few good options' The use of Huawei technology in the 5G network was signed off by No 10 and security experts earlier this year, with the caveats of keeping the kit out of the most sensitive areas and capping its market share at 35%. But Tory critics say the firm is an arm of the Chinese state and a risk to UK security - claims the firm rejects. Other countries, including the US and Australia, have banned Huawei from their own networks and criticised the UK's decision. After the Commons vote, Huawei vice president Victor Zhang, said: ""An evidence-based approach is needed, so we were disappointed to hear some groundless accusations asserted. ""The industry and experts agree that banning Huawei equipment would leave Britain less secure, less productive and less innovative."" Today's revolt on Huawei leaves Boris Johnson with one king-sized political headache. It will likely prompt a bout of teeth gnashing in Downing Street that so many Tories should be ready to defy the PM so soon after he delivered them a whopping election victory. But it will also sting that their ranks were made up of some of the most senior Tory MPs, including a solid block of former cabinet ministers. In other words, these are not the sort of MPs who No 10 might expect to be able to bully back into line. And this matters because the rebellion could pave the way for an even bigger one in the summer that could yet overturn the Huawei decision, with several Tory MPs making clear they are ready to join the rebels once the key 5G legislation comes back to the Commons. A defeat for Mr Johnson over such a high profile issue would be a deeply wounding blow - all the more so since he went out on a limb to give his personal go-ahead to Huawei despite the fury of the White House and other allies. Time perhaps for the PM to root out the paracetamol. A group of Tory MPs, led by the party's former leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith, put forward an amendment to the Telecommunications Infrastructure Bill to try and stop Huawei's involvement. The amendment would have seen firms classified as ""high-risk vendors"" by the National Cyber Security Centre be banned entirely from the UK's 5G project by 31 December 2022. Sir Iain said he and his colleagues were ""genuinely concerned that this country has got itself far too bound in to a process in which we are reliant on untrusted vendors"". Speaking in the Commons, the backbencher accused the Chinese government of spending 20 years ""underbidding"" other technology firms until Huawei dominated the market, and the outcome was a risk to the UK's security. He said using Huawei's technology was a ""statement of absence of thought by any government"", adding: ""If defence of the realm is our number one priority, then this becomes demi-defence of the realm, and I am simply not prepared to put up with that."" This video can not be played IDS warns UK ""in thrall"" to untrusted telecoms providers Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden tried to reassure the group of backbenchers with the promise of bringing forward a Telecoms Security Bill before the summer recess ""so all honourable members will be able to debate these points extensively"". He also said the government wanted to work with itsFive Eyes security partners- including the US - on alternative solutions so the UK could ""get to a position where we do not have to use high-risk vendors at all"". But Mr Dowden could not give a timetable for the exclusion of such companies, except to say it would be ""in this Parliament"" - meaning within the next five years. As a result, Sir Iain pushed his amendment to a vote, marking the first Tory rebellion against the government since Boris Johnson won the election in December. However, while 282 MPs from across the House voted in favour of the amendment, 306 MPs voted against, defeating it. There were 38 Conservative MPs who rebelled against their government by voting for the amendment - including former international trade secretary Liam Fox, ex-Brexit secretary David Davis and former housing minister Esther McVey. Conservative MP and Foreign Affairs Committee chairman, Tom Tugendhat, also voted in favour of the amendment, saying he did ""not get the commitments"" he wanted from the government. ""I am sorry that I could not support the government. I hope the policy will change before we come to the main Telecoms Security Bill before the summer."" The Telecommunications Infrastructure Bill later passed without needing a vote. China warns of Huawei 5G 'witch-hunt' What is Huawei and what threat does it pose?

Three-year-old Dalmatian Lottie was taken from Chloe Hopkins' home in Peatling Parva, Leicestershire, in early December. An appeal to find the dog was widely shared on social media and was backedby TV presenter Chris Packham. Chloe's mother, Gemma Hopkins, posted on a Facebook page about the appeal that Lottie's body had been found. She told the BBC the family was given the news on Sunday after Lottie's microchip was scanned by a vet. Leicestershire Police said the dog was found in a layby in Countesthorpe - about four miles (6.4km) away from the family's home - on Sunday morning. Chloe told her mum all she wanted for Christmas was to get Lottie back Lottie - who required specialist food for a liver condition - vanished on 1 December when thieves broke into the family home. Following the theft, Mrs Hopkins described the dog as her daughter's ""best friend"", saying she helped to keep her calm. She wrote on Facebook: ""Having to identify her was the hardest thing I've done. ""I've now got to break my 12-year-old's heart tonight. ""We never wanted this ending. We kept hopeful. Goodbye my crazy bunch of spots."" She told the BBC her daughter had since been given the news. Hundreds of people have shared their condolences on social media.

"New South Wales Police Minister David Elliott fires a submachine gun in 2018 Australian authorities are investigating whether a state police minister broke the law by firing two banned weapons at a prison's gun range. New South Wales lawmaker David Elliott referred his own case to police after photos emerged showing him with the guns at a 2018 opening for the range. Australia bans civilian use of semi-automatic and automatic weapons but exceptions can be made with permission. Both Mr Elliott and prison officials blamed it on an ""administrative error"".

Such weapons can be used by the military and elite police and prison officers. Police Minister David Elliott (left) posted the pictures on his Facebook account Mr Elliott shared pictures from the event in a Facebook post at the time, saying he had dedicated the range to a prison guard who had died. Both he and the man's widow had fired an ""official shot"" in tribute, he added. Mr Elliott said he had ""acted in good faith"" and used the weapons under ""strict supervision"", believing that prison authorities had signed off on necessary paperwork.

"The report says people will need to fly less The UK cannot go climate neutral much before 2050 unless people stop flying and eating red meat almost completely, a report says. But it warns that the British public do not look ready to take such steps and substantially change their lifestyle. The report challenges the views of campaign group Extinction Rebellion. It believes the UK target of climate neutrality by 2050 will result in harm to the climate. The claim comes from the government-funded research group Energy Systems Catapult, whose computer models are used by the Committee on Climate Change, which advises government. Its report says: ""A number of groups have called for net zero to be accelerated to 2025, 2030 or 2040. ""Achieving net zero significantly earlier than 2050 in our modelling exceeds even our most speculative measures, with rates of change for power, heat and road transport that push against the bounds of plausibility."" A really simple guide to climate change Big lifestyle changes 'needed to cut emissions' But the authors offer some optimism too. They calculate that the UKcancut emissions fast enough to be climate neutral by 2050 â but only if ministers act much more quickly. They say the government urgently needs to invest in three key technologies: carbon capture and storage with bioenergy crops; hydrogen for a wide variety of uses; and advanced nuclear power. The report modelled options for society to 2050. It concluded that if decisions are made early, the cost of climate neutrality can be held down to 1-2% of national wealth - GDP. Scenarios rely on some technologies still in their infancy, which will be controversial. For instance, it draws heavily on burning energy crops, capturing the carbon emissions and burying them underground. It says hydrogen use will need to grow to supply industry, heat and heavy transport. Electricity generation will need to double with heavy reliance on solar power and offshore wind. GRETA THUNBERG:What does she want? A TO Z:Climate-related words and phrases explained YOUR HOME:How much warmer is your city?,external FOOD:What is your diet's carbon footprint? IN CHARTS:How warm has the world got? Controversially, it calls forsmall, modular nuclear reactorsto support three-quarters of heating in cities through district heating systems. Modular reactors are much smaller than conventional reactors, and brought to a site in a kit of parts to be assembled. It warns that livestock production for dairy and meat may need to be cut by 50% rather than the 20% currently envisaged by the Committee on Climate Change. And people will need to eat less meat and dairy by the same amount. The reportâs author, Scott Milne, said: âWhichever pathway the UK takes, innovation, investment and inducements across low-carbon technology, land use and lifestyle are essential to achieve net zero. Adopting new technologies, such as hydrogen energy, will be crucial ""And there are massive economic opportunities for the UK to lead the world in these areas."" However, the report warns that the public do not appear ready for substantial lifestyle changes. It warns, for instance, that if peopleâs homes are better insulated, they may choose to spend the same amount on heating to deliver a warmer home. It says: âEarly evidence suggests a general willingness to adopt new technologies (such as new heating or mobility) as long as these can deliver the same experiences as before. âConversely, approaching the subject of dietary change or aviation often elicits a more resistant and emotional response.â Some experts will be critical of the reportâs expectation that new technologies such as carbon capture and storage will be rapidly adopted. A recent report said it was unrealistic to expect that carbon capture and hydrogenwill develop fast enough to achieve the net zero target. A spokesperson for Extinction Rebellion told BBC News: ""The global response to coronavirus shows we can radically address crises if we put our minds to it. Meanwhile, the net zero date has not been put to the people of the UK. ""The science tells us that net zero by 2050 means a hell of a lot worse than giving up flying and red meat - people are dying now around the world as you read this due to governmental inaction."" The report was not welcomed by the National Beef Association. Its spokesman Neil Shand told BBC News that scientific studies typically underestimate the role of livestock in capturing carbon in the soil. He said: âIt does seem rather unfortunate that the report links beef production and aviation in this way. âThe timing is more than a little ironic; the shops are full of people panic-buying and it seems clear that the nationâs food sector relies very heavily on imports, and the associated transport that brings them into the UK. ""Food produced on their own doorstep, using a system where animal and non-animal foods are symbiotic requires very little air travel, and makes excellent use of the resources our beautiful country provides. Foreign travel does not have the same necessity."" In addition, a report from a group of environmentally-minded business leaders has called on the government to show increased ambition and delivery of carbon-cutting policies to get the UK on track to meet climate goals. It said there was an urgent need especially for policies to bring low-carbon heating to people's homes.

"The Welsh Government overruled Newport council to allow this development on a flood plain Building new homes on flood plains in Wales must stop, campaigners have said. Figures show more than 2,000 houses were granted planning permission in flood risk areas in Wales between 2016 and 2019. However, damage caused by storms Ciara and Dennis has left residents counting the cost of that policy and raised concerns over plans to build more. The Welsh Government is toughening rules but some blame ministers and the assembly for overruling councils. While applications tobuild 2,159 homes on flood plains,externalwere granted by councils in Wales over the past three years, plans for just 246 were rejected. In addition, more than 3,000 acres of land were also approved for non-residential use in these areas - with more to be requested. Heavy rain brings flooding and travel disruption Dr Doug Parr, chief scientist at Greenpeace UK, said the policy was ""literally planning for disaster"". ""Why are we planning to build more homes in high-risk flood areas when we know that the situation is only going to get worse because of the climate emergency? ""We need to rethink where and how we build homes, giving more powers to environmental watchdogs to keep developers in check, and invest more in preventing floods from happening."" Natural Resources Wales (NRW) has warned the recent floods prove the consequences of building houses on high-risk areas ""are just too great"". Many parts of Wales were affected by flooding last month The Welsh Government has pointed the finger at local councils in itsplanning services annual review,external. It said the latest number of approvals - 652 in 2018-19 - showed a ""concerning willingness by local authorities"" to grant planning permission for residential development in areas at risk of flooding. Of those 652 properties, 167 are in areas with no flood defence. Environmental consultant Future Climate Info said the growing pressure to meet housing demands has led to an increasing number of new homes being built in areas at risk from flooding. Recent developments in flood zones include 33 flats alongside the Afon Rheidol as part of theredevelopment of Aberystwyth Football Club'sPark Avenue ground and 10 houses near Glynneath recreation ground in Neath Port Talbot. Plans to build another77 homes on a new housing estate previously hit by floodingwill be heard by Denbighshire council on Wednesday. The Glasdir estate flooded in 2012 Planning officers say the Glasdir Estate development, on a flood plain of the River Clwyd in Ruthin, should go ahead. That is despite work being delayed after 120 new homes were damaged by flooding in 2012. House buyers claimed, at the time, they had been assured the risk was low. However, some councillors and residents have turned the tables on the Welsh Government - accusing ministers of ignoring local concerns and advice. Storms 'a taste of things to come' for Wales Households 'must get insured and plan for floods' Can more be done to combat flooding? Plans for more than 130 homes in Rossettwere unanimously rejectedby Wrexham councillors in January 2019. Among the council's concerns was the regularflooding from the nearby River Alyn. But last month, they were notified in a letter signed by Welsh minister for housing, Julie James, that their decision had been overturned. A planning inspector found it was not on a flood plain though recommended drainage conditions due to concerns over surface water. Villagers are now hoping to take their protest to a judicial review. Planning officers had said the scheme in Rossett would help meet future housing needs The site last month ""The Welsh Government says one thing but does another,"" said local councillor Hugh Jones. ""It's an inexplicable decision that ignores it's own declaration of a climate emergency, given theâland continues to flood on a regular basis. ""People living nearby are finding it virtually impossible to get household insurance and the situation is only going to get worse."" The Flood Re scheme was developed between the UK government and insurance companies, where the cost of flood insurance is linked to a property's council tax band. However, the scheme does not cover houses built after 1 January 2009 to ""avoid incentivising the building of new homes"" in flood risk areas. Chief executive Andy Bord said: ""Government guidance is very clear that new properties should not be built where they will be at risk from flooding."" Flooding close to land where planning for 130 houses has been granted by Monmouthshire council for Caldicot The minister for planning usually decides whether to ""call-in"" a planning application and makes a decision based on a report and recommendation from a planning inspector. Previously the decision was determined by the cross-party assembly planning decision committee. One person already counting the cost of that committee allowing construction on a flood plain is Leigh Adams, 46. How dangerous is floodwater? In pictures: Storm Dennis brings flooding to Wales Storm Ciara: 'Our village is drowning' He and his family had to run from their new house in Bassaleg, near Newport, as the River Ebbw, swollen by heavy rainfall during Storm Dennis,swept away his garden,external. About 25ft (7.6m) of land, including property and their patio, was washed away and the foundations of the house built just 20 months earlier are now exposed. The green area in front of the house (left) has disappeared after Storm Dennis (right) ""A neighbour was knocking on our front door at 6am and we saw the bank slowly collapsing,"" said Mr Adams. ""I rushed to get my seven-year-old daughter and wife Simone out of the house. ""I told them 'we have to get out now' as I watched the ground crumble towards the back door. I was petrified. It was distressing and we're all still in a state of shock. ""No-one is taking responsibility for why my house was built there."" The house is part of a development that will eventually total 150 new homes on the former Tredegar Park golf course. Newport council refused planning permission amid flooding concerns and the loss of a natural floodplain. A subsequent planning inquiry agreed. However, those rulings wereoverturned by the assembly committee,external, in 2007, when it judged the risk of flooding was not ""unacceptable"" and was satisfied the developer would improve flood defences. That ruling has paved the way for other developments on areas at risk of flooding, including Bettws and Caerleon in Newport. Future Climate Info identified 17 of a sample of 50 developments around Newport located within flood plains putting communities ""at a significant risk"". The river has exposed the foundations of Mr Adams' newly-built house It has also warned house buyers and those renting private properties to check the flood risks beforehand. ""A significant proportion of the UK population may have little or no idea whether they are situated within an area prone to flood risk and therefore vulnerable to the significant cost and upheaval that a flood event could bring,"" said managing director Tim Champney. Developer Redrow said it was paying for Mr Adams' family to stay in a hotel until the end of the month, but denied responsibility for the land damaged. Kate Lacey, head of customer services, added: ""There are 108 occupied homes on the site and the Adams' home is the only affected property as a result of the storm damage."" Newport council is investigating and a spokeswoman said the authority was working to ""protect people and property"" following the ""devastating"" flooding last month. Roads and gardens in Crickhowell, Powys, were turned into lakes, after the river burst its banks The Environment Agency in England has saidbuilding homes on flood plains should be resistedand homes made more resilient. Environment Minister Lesley Griffiths declareda climate emergency in Wales in April 2019, saying she hoped it would ""trigger a wave of action at home and internationally"". The Welsh Government is in the process of strengthening itsplanning policy,external""partly in response to the high number of homes permitted in flood risk areas since 2015"". It said it wants to make sure new developments, homes and communities are protected from flood risk, take climate risks into account and encourage climate change adaptation. This will see new flood risk maps drawn up by NRW to ""better understand future risk"". ""New developments should be not be in areas which are at high risk of flooding, the consequences are just too great - as recent events have shown,"" said Jeremy Parr, NRW head of flood incident risk management. ""Where it is considered, only those developments where the risks are  shown to be manageable should be located within areas at risk of flooding.""

"Kaila, centre right, and her husband Raffaele with their family Kaila Haines is a US citizen married to an Italian man and has been living in Italy for 30 years. She lives in Monfalcone, east of Venice, where her husband is undergoing self-imposed quarantine after exhibiting flu-like symptoms, but is currently stuck in Milan, where she was working when the quarantine came into force. Here she describes the situation: I work in Milan Monday to Friday and go back on the weekend. My husband is a university professor in Venice. In recent months we've been hearing about these cases but it's been pretty much business as usual. About one in 10 people have been in masks, but it's been very laid-back despite all the hype and doom and gloom on the news. But then at the beginning of last week, my husband came down with the fever. EASY STEPS:What can I do? A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? IMMUNITY:Are women and children less affected? MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash The health ministry has asked anybody who has a fever or flu-like symptoms just to isolate themselves. Let's not take any chances, stay home for 20 days. So that's what he did. I was supposed to be going home this past weekend and did not because he was sick and in isolation. Then I got stuck here in Milan because over the weekend they imposed this shutdown in the Lombardy region. So I'm here until 3 April but he'll come out of isolation on 20 March. It's very surreal. I went out yesterday morning to the grocery store because I was kind of curious to see if everyone was making a run on pasta and things like that. You read the newspapers and that's what everyone is saying. The situation was quite tense because there was a person on the loudspeaker who was reminding everyone in the store every 30 seconds that they had to keep their one-metre distance from each other. Quarantined inside Italy's red zone Northern Italy quarantines 16 million people Britons urged not to visit Italy quarantine areas They were quite aggressively inviting everyone to keep their distance. That was quite an unusual feeling. But overall there was no run on the supermarket. Everyone was just like me, running out of milk and getting a few things they needed for the weekend. From that respect it was pretty relaxed. Then I walked down one of the main shopping roads and about 70% of the stores were closed. The bars were open. It was a gorgeous day so everyone was out on their bicycles. Most of the bars have tables outside and I could see they had distanced the tables, so there are less tables than there used to be. There were people having their coffee on the sidewalk at their little cafe, so it was very relaxed. Kaila Haines with her family in Milan in happier times There wasn't a sense of panic or urgency. I think it might take a while for people to realise they need to be a little more careful in keeping their distance and things like that. This week I'm on vacation but I will have to work from home. I'm taking it in my stride. My husband only had a fever for a few days. He has a little bit of a cough and he's going a little stir crazy. We have neighbours who are doing the grocery shopping and leaving it at the door for him. He said he's going to have to learn how to cook -  he doesn't know how to cook. We celebrated our 30th anniversary in September. It's not been easy. It's been a challenging year for us in general because I got a promotion and now we see each other on the weekends, but now it's tough.

"The government has defeated the first rebellion from its own MPs over plans to allow Huawei to be used in the UK's 5G mobile network. Thirty-eight Conservative rebels backed an amendment to end the Chinese firm's participation in the project by the start of 2023. Despite promises from the government of a new bill to address their concerns, rebel MPs pushed their plan to a vote. But with a large Commons majority, the government defeated it by 24 votes. Culture Minister Matt Warman said the government had heard the points ""loud and clear"". He added: ""We will now engage intensively with colleagues across the House to make sure that we will make our case at every possible levelâ¦and we will underline that we will always put national security at the very top of our agenda."" China warns of Huawei 5G 'witch-hunt' What is Huawei and how could it be a security threat? Huawei 5G verdict is decision 'with few good options' The use of Huawei technology in the 5G network was signed off by No 10 and security experts earlier this year, with the caveats of keeping the kit out of the most sensitive areas and capping its market share at 35%. But Tory critics say the firm is an arm of the Chinese state and a risk to UK security - claims the firm rejects. Other countries, including the US and Australia, have banned Huawei from their own networks and criticised the UK's decision. After the Commons vote, Huawei vice president Victor Zhang, said: ""An evidence-based approach is needed, so we were disappointed to hear some groundless accusations asserted. ""The industry and experts agree that banning Huawei equipment would leave Britain less secure, less productive and less innovative."" Today's revolt on Huawei leaves Boris Johnson with one king-sized political headache. It will likely prompt a bout of teeth gnashing in Downing Street that so many Tories should be ready to defy the PM so soon after he delivered them a whopping election victory. But it will also sting that their ranks were made up of some of the most senior Tory MPs, including a solid block of former cabinet ministers. In other words, these are not the sort of MPs who No 10 might expect to be able to bully back into line. And this matters because the rebellion could pave the way for an even bigger one in the summer that could yet overturn the Huawei decision, with several Tory MPs making clear they are ready to join the rebels once the key 5G legislation comes back to the Commons. A defeat for Mr Johnson over such a high profile issue would be a deeply wounding blow - all the more so since he went out on a limb to give his personal go-ahead to Huawei despite the fury of the White House and other allies. Time perhaps for the PM to root out the paracetamol. A group of Tory MPs, led by the party's former leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith, put forward an amendment to the Telecommunications Infrastructure Bill to try and stop Huawei's involvement. The amendment would have seen firms classified as ""high-risk vendors"" by the National Cyber Security Centre be banned entirely from the UK's 5G project by 31 December 2022. Sir Iain said he and his colleagues were ""genuinely concerned that this country has got itself far too bound in to a process in which we are reliant on untrusted vendors"". Speaking in the Commons, the backbencher accused the Chinese government of spending 20 years ""underbidding"" other technology firms until Huawei dominated the market, and the outcome was a risk to the UK's security. He said using Huawei's technology was a ""statement of absence of thought by any government"", adding: ""If defence of the realm is our number one priority, then this becomes demi-defence of the realm, and I am simply not prepared to put up with that."" This video can not be played IDS warns UK ""in thrall"" to untrusted telecoms providers Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden tried to reassure the group of backbenchers with the promise of bringing forward a Telecoms Security Bill before the summer recess ""so all honourable members will be able to debate these points extensively"". He also said the government wanted to work with itsFive Eyes security partners- including the US - on alternative solutions so the UK could ""get to a position where we do not have to use high-risk vendors at all"". But Mr Dowden could not give a timetable for the exclusion of such companies, except to say it would be ""in this Parliament"" - meaning within the next five years. As a result, Sir Iain pushed his amendment to a vote, marking the first Tory rebellion against the government since Boris Johnson won the election in December. However, while 282 MPs from across the House voted in favour of the amendment, 306 MPs voted against, defeating it. There were 38 Conservative MPs who rebelled against their government by voting for the amendment - including former international trade secretary Liam Fox, ex-Brexit secretary David Davis and former housing minister Esther McVey. Conservative MP and Foreign Affairs Committee chairman, Tom Tugendhat, also voted in favour of the amendment, saying he did ""not get the commitments"" he wanted from the government. ""I am sorry that I could not support the government. I hope the policy will change before we come to the main Telecoms Security Bill before the summer.""

"New South Wales Police Minister David Elliott fires a submachine gun in 2018 Australian authorities are investigating whether a state police minister broke the law by firing two banned weapons at a prison's gun range. New South Wales lawmaker David Elliott referred his own case to police after photos emerged showing him with the guns at a 2018 opening for the range. Australia bans civilian use of semi-automatic and automatic weapons but exceptions can be made with permission. Both Mr Elliott and prison officials blamed it on an ""administrative error"". Australian media reported he fired a submachine gun and a semi-automatic pistol at the newly refurbished range in Sydney in September 2018. In NSW, someone who uses an unauthorised firearm can be jailed for up to 14 years. The revived gun ownership debate in Australia Australian party 'courted US pro-gun group' Opposition MPs criticised Mr Elliott for being unaware of legal requirements. ""You'd have to wonder what is going through the mind of a senior ministerâ¦ to go and pick up a lethal weapon like this without checking if they had a lawful capacity to do that,"" said Greens lawmaker David Shoebridge. Such weapons can be used by the military and elite police and prison officers. Police Minister David Elliott (left) posted the pictures on his Facebook account Mr Elliott shared pictures from the event in a Facebook post at the time, saying he had dedicated the range to a prison guard who had died. Both he and the man's widow had fired an ""official shot"" in tribute, he added. Mr Elliott said he had ""acted in good faith"" and used the weapons under ""strict supervision"", believing that prison authorities had signed off on necessary paperwork. He said he contacted police this week after being advised the prison authority - Corrective Services NSW -  may have potentially broken the law ""with respect to potentially hundreds of individuals, including myself, who have used the range"". How mass shootings have changed gun laws Why a 2019 Australian mass shooting was 'unusual' Australian amnesty yields 57,000 guns Corrective Services NSW apologised to Mr Elliott for ""any embarrassment caused"". Mr Elliott, who is also the minister for emergency services, has been under fire from political opponents in recent times.

"The decision to delay closing schools and introduce other strict measures to combat coronavirus has been defended by England's deputy chief medical officer. Dr Jenny Harries said experts are assessing new cases on an hourly basis to achieve a ""balanced response"". It comes as a man in his early 80s became the sixth person with the virus to die in the UK. Meanwhile, manyairlines cutthousands of flights, including to and from Italy, in the wake of the outbreak. According to the latest figures, there were373 confirmed cases as of 09:00 GMT,externalon Tuesday. Of them, 324 are in England. Northern Irelandannounced,externalfour more cases, bringing its total to 16, and Scotlandconfirmed another,externalfour cases, increasing its number to 27. The latest death happened on Monday evening and was a man with underlying health conditions who was being looked after at Watford General Hospital, the West Hertfordshire Hospitals NHS Trust said. He caught the virus in the UK and officials are trying to trace who he was in contact with, the country's chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty said. EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? GETTING READY:How prepared is the UK? MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak TRAVEL PLANS:What are your rights? Earlier, Dr Harries said the vast majority of those diagnosed with coronavirus in Britain are ""pretty well"" but that they may ""feel a bit rough for a few days"". She told BBC Breakfast new government measures could follow as UK cases begin to rise rapidly over the next two weeks. She added that people with flu-like symptoms will be advised to self-isolate within 10 to 14 days and, at the same time, significant increases in the number of cases are likely to begin. Dr Harries said cancelling big outdoor events like football matches would not necessarily be a decision supported by science. ""The virus will not survive very long outside,"" she said. ""Many outdoor events, particularly, are relatively safe."" In other developments: The UK Foreign Office warned Britons against all but essential travel to Italyafter the country extended its coronavirus measures,including travel restrictions Italian tourists have been told to self-isolate on arrival in Britain as several UK airlines cancelled flights to and from Italian airports The owner of Nottingham Forest FC, Evangelos Marinakis,has tested positiveafter returning from Greece Royal Bank of Scotland said it would allow customers to defer mortgage payments if needed The NHS partnered with technology firms to help promote official health advice online And new research showed that, on average, it took five daysfor people to show symptoms of the virus Italy's extended quarantine measures require residents to stay home, seek permission for essential travel, and justify leaving the country. On Sunday, a 60-year-old man from Greater Manchester became the third person to die after contracting coronavirus after recently visiting northern Italy. The son said his father fell ill ""instantly"" after returning to the UK at the end of February. He turned up at a local health centre for a routine appointment and, when he said he had been to Italy, ""panic broke out"". His father was taken to North Manchester General Hospital and the rest of the family were told to self-isolate - with Public Health England sending daily texts asking if they are showing symptoms. ""Since we cannot go outside we regularly called the ward where he was ill,""the man's son told BBC Bengali.""And on a daily basis and we asked them how he was. They did not allow me to speak to him directly. The son said his father - who had underlying conditions - was ""healthy"" by his own standards ""The first couple of days he was fairly stable but after that they were saying his blood was not oxygenated enough. Also his heartbeat was not stable either."" The son said they received a phone call from the hospital saying his father - who had underlying conditions including arthritis, heart problems, and cholesterol -  had died. ""Obviously I could not believe it because two months ago this thing didn't even exist and today it took away my father. ""It took me quite a long time to process the whole thing that I'm not going to be able to see him anymore."" British Airways has cancelled all of its flights to and from Italy until 4 April, and has asked staff to take voluntary unpaid leave. Ryanair will cancel all its flights to and from Italy from Saturday until 8 April, while Easyjet cancelled the majority of its flights to and from the country and Jet2 cancelled its Italian routes until 26 April. BA said customers due to fly to or from Italy before 4 April can rebook to a later date until the end of May, move their destination to Geneva or Zurich, or receive a full refund. A Foreign Office spokesman said: ""The advice is that anyone who arrives from Italy subsequent to the Italian government decision should now self-isolate for 14 days."" Downing Street said Italians arriving in the UK were being given the same advice as Britons to self-isolate and that the government had facilities available to accommodate them. Meanwhile airline Norwegian, which operates from several UK airports, said it was cutting 3,000 flights and reducing staff numbers after a fall in demand it attributed to coronavirus. This video can not be played Steps the NHS says you should take to protect yourself from Covid-19 The NHS has unveiled a range of measures as part of its response to try to stop fake news being spread about coronavirus on the internet. Searches for ""coronavirus"" on Google, Facebook and YouTube will now promote information from the National Health Service or the World Health Organization. The NHS saidit had worked with Twitter to take down an account claiming to be a hospital and spreading false information, while it is also speaking out against homeopaths promoting false treatments online. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the actions meant the public could access accurate health information ""which is more crucial than ever as we continue our response to coronavirus"". All of Italy placed under coronavirus lockdown UK supermarket delivery hours extended Unit set up to counter false coronavirus claims The UK is currently in the first phase - ""containment"" - ofthe government's four-part plan,external. Asked about statutory sick pay for workers who are not currently eligible, Health Secretary Matt Hancock told MPs that ""whatever the status of people"" who are employed, the government will ""ensure that they will get the support so they're not penalised for doing the right thing"". On Monday, health officials said people who showed ""even minor"" signs of respiratory tract infections or a fever would - within the next 14 days - be told to self-isolate for a week in an effort to tackle the outbreak. The UK government has also announced it is to extend shop delivery hoursto ensure that supermarkets have basic items, amid stockpiling concerns. The environment department, Defra, said by allowing night-time deliveries - currently restricted to avoid disturbing locals - stock would be able to move more quickly from warehouses to shelves.

There were 142 British people on the ship, whichspent five days stranded off the coastof California. However, one of the Britons on board, Jackie Bissell, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme she had yet to hear from the ship's captain about her departure. ""They haven't said anything about when we can go,"" she said. ""It's very unnerving to be left out here when we don't know what's going to happen."" What's the risk on public transport? Can you stop people stockpiling? Coronavirus symptoms 'take five days to show' Elsewhere, crowds exceeding 60,000 are expected on all four days of horse racing's Cheltenham Festival, which starts on Tuesday afternoon.

"Shares in the US enjoyed a late-afternoon boost on Tuesday as a rise in oil prices helped markets to recover some ground one day after the biggest falls since the 2008 financial crisis. The three main US indexes closed more than 4.9% higher. Earlier, shares in Europe slipped into negative territory, despite initial bounce-backs. London's FTSE 100 ended almost flat, after a 7.7% drop the day before. In France and Germany, the main indexes dropped more than 1.4%. Markets were battered on Mondayin reaction to the threat of an oil price war between Russia and Saudi Arabia. But after falling as much as 30% on Monday, oil prices rebounded slightly, with Brent crude more than 8% higher. Analysts said US markets were helped along by promises from the White House to take steps to protect the US economy against the impact of the coronavirus outbreak. ""Obviously there has been concern voiced in the market that this is not being contained and more needs to be done,"" said William Foster, vice president and lead US analyst for Moody's Investors Service. ""Now we're starting to see a response from the US federal government, the administration and Congress that. I think that's going to be part of the solution to supporting the economy... and ultimately stabilising the markets."" Earlier, shares in Japan rose after Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said his government would work closely with the central bank to boost the economy. Japan's benchmark index, the Nikkei 225, had started Tuesday more than 3% down but bounced back following Mr Abe's comments to end 1% higher. In Hong Kong, the main Hang Seng market rose 1.4% buoyed by Japan's moves to calm investors. The index had fallen more than 4% on Monday. London's FTSE index was 0.23% higher at the end of Tuesday at 5,979. The optimism on Tuesday was helped by a slowdown in reported cases of coronavirus in China, according to Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK. ""This optimism, along with expectations around further central bank actions is, for now, offsetting the news that the whole of Italy has gone into lockdown and the Spanish government has taken the decision to close all schools and universities in Madrid,"" he said. Monday saw the steepest declines in many global financial markets since the 2008 financial crisis. The major US stock indexes fell so sharply at the start of trading that the buying and selling of shares was halted for 15 minutes, as a so-called ""circuit breaker"" aimed at curbing panicky selling came into effect. The dramatic falls in response to fears over the impact of the coronavirus were typical of market behaviour, said Kathleen Brooks, director at Minerva Analysis. ""Markets are so emotional, it's unbelievable,"" she said. ""Act first, think later. This was the same in 2008, you have these massive declines and then the market is on pause."" Coronavirus: What are your travel rights? A problem unlike any Donald Trump has faced She said she thought markets would recover eventually, as ""if you look at long-term charts they always recover"". However, in the short term, ""we could see another decline if we don't see the stimulus that's required. We need to hear more positive things because that's when stock markets go up."" Many people's initial reaction to ""the markets"" is that they are not directly affected, because they do not invest money. Yet there are millions of people with a pension - either private or through work - who will see their savings (in what is known as a defined contribution pension) invested by pension schemes. The value of their savings pot is influenced by the performance of these investments. So big rises or falls can affect your pension, but the advice is to remember that pension savings, like any investments, are usually a long-term bet. Read more here. Major central banks have pledged to pump cash into the financial system while governments are mulling stimulus measures to tackle the economic hit. These include cuts to interest rates to encourage companies to borrow money and expand. However, former Bank of England governor Mervyn King told BBC 5 live'sWake Up to Money: ""I don't think that a cut in interest rates now is actually going to do a great deal to help the situation, it maybe a sign of reassurance but it is not more than that. ""What is needed now are targeted measures to help business deal with a short-term crisis and collapse of their cash flow, and I think the Bank of England understands that very well.""
