The Frenchman has signed a two-year deal and says his side canchallenge for the Premier League titlenext term. Forward Sanchez and midfielder Ozil are entering the final year of their deals. ""If they have to say cheerio to those two players, then that is the right decision,"" Keown told BBC Radio 5 live. Hear more from Keown speaking to BBC Radio 5 live Wenger targets Premier League title after signing new deal Listen to the latest Football Daily podcast Chile striker Sanchez scored 24 goals and provided 10 assists for the Gunners last season while Germany player Ozil netted eight goals and laid on nine assists. Wenger's side finished fifth in the league, missing out on Champions League football for the first time in 20 years. The north London club went out of this year's competition at the last-16 stage followinga 10-2 aggregate defeatby Bayern Munich. Sanchez has reportedlybeen offered,externala new Â£300,000-a-week contract, while Ozil has reportedlyrefused to sign,externala Â£250,000-a-week deal. Arsene Wenger has won three Premier League titles and seven FA Cups in 21 years at Arsenal ""They have been overindulged at times this season and they let Arsenal down in the period when they lost twice to Bayern Munich, conceding 10 goals. That is the level of the problem,"" said Keown, who played more than 300 games for Arsenal. ""The manager needs to make some really tough decisions now. Sanchez's contract needs to get 100% secured. Is that going to happen? Will Ozil leave? ""I am sure both players want to go elsewhere because they want to win the Champions League, win the Premier League and maybe they do not feel it can be done at Arsenal. The club is bigger than two individuals."" Arsene staying is 'good news' - Lauren Arsenal a 'long way behind' - Lineker 21 years, 162 players, Â£700m spent, 16 trophies - and counting Can Arsene write a new chapter in Arsenal's history? Wenger has said his side are ""two players"" off challenging for the title, and the club are expected to spend at least Â£100m on new players in the upcoming transfer window - which opens on 1 July - having also spent about that figure last summer. Ex-captain Tony Adams, who played more than 500 games in a one-club career at Arsenal, feels the current group of players are not good enough to challenge for major honours. ""Maybe he thinks they can win the league in the next two years or get back into the Champions League. Looking at this squad, I don't think they can,"" Adams told BBC Wiltshire. ""But I can understand the frustration of the fans that want a league title and want to be competitive. ""We need to start being competitive and seen as number one by number one players instead of number four players on the pecking list."" Russian billionaire Alisher Usmanov owns a 30% stake in the club and hada Â£1bn bid to wrest controlfrom majority shareholder Stan Kroenke rejected. He issued a statement on Wednesday which called on the board to support Wenger. ""He has a great opportunity to deliver the success that the fans deserve and the legacy that his long contribution merits. However, without the right support there remains a real risk that his legacy will be tarnished,"" he added. Adams added he does not want Wenger's job to ""end in tears"". ""I just do not want it to all fall apart in the next two years and Arsene is seen as a villain, a bad man for Arsenal. that would be wrong. He has been so brilliant for the club,"" he said. Wenger joined the club in 1996 and has won three league titles - the last in their unbeaten season of 2003-04 - andseven FA Cup titles- a record for any manager. But last season saw regular protests from some supporters, who called for him to end his long tenure at the club. Arsenal Supporters' Trust spokesperson Tim Payton told BBC Sport that fans have ""a right to a voice"". Arsenal Fan TV presenter Robbie Lyle says the atmosphere at Emirates Stadium could become ""toxic"" again next season if they lose back-to-back games. Arsenal fans protested regularly against manager Arsene Wenger this season Keown added: ""Whether the fans want this decision or not, they have to get behind the manger. You cannot have a situation like last season, where there was a really difficult environment for the players to go in to. ""Coming off the bus there were people hurling abuse, all the 'Wenger Out' placards. It is time now they got behind the manager for the next two years and if that is going to be the send-off, then that is what he deserves.""

"Arsene Wenger won a record seventh FA Cup on Saturday but has faced pressure from Arsenal fans this season Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger is targeting next season's Premier League title after signing a new two-year deal at the club. The agreement does not include a break clause and, should it be completed, will extend his reign to 23 years. Neither Arsenal nor Wenger, 67, see this as definitely being his final contract. ""I love this club and I am looking forward to the future with optimism and excitement,"" said Wenger. Sell 'overindulged' Sanchez and Ozil - Keown 21 years, 162 players, Â£700m spent, 16 trophies - and counting Listen to the latest Football Daily podcast Arsenal are expected to spend at least Â£100m on new players in the upcoming transfer window - which opens on 1 July - having also spent around that figure last summer. ""This is a strong group of players and with some additions we can be even more successful,"" Wenger told the club website. ""We're committed to mounting a sustained league challenge and that will be our focus this summer and next season."" This video can not be played Arsene Wenger: Arsenal boss calls for togetherness from the fans The Gunners finished fifth in the Premier League this season, the first time they have finished outside the top four since the Frenchman joined in 1996. They finished 18 points behind champions Chelsea, butbeat the Blues 2-1to win the FA Cup at Wembley on Saturday. Wenger met club owner Stan Kroenke on Monday to determine his future, with the decision relayed to directors at a Tuesday board meeting. Following Wednesday's official announcement, chief executive Ivan Gazidis said: ""There is no complacency anywhere at this club. ""Our goal is to compete for and win trophies here and in Europe. Everything we do is designed to make that happen and we will be working hard on and off the pitch this summer to improve and make a strong challenge next season."" American majority owner Kroenke said the Gunners' ambition was to win the Premier League and ""other major trophies in Europe"" under Frenchman Wenger. ""It's what the fans, players, staff, manager and board expect and we won't rest until that is achieved - Arsene is the best person to help us make that happen,"" he added. Uzbek-born Russian billionaire Alisher Usmanov, who madea Â£1bn bid to wrest controlof the club from Kroenke earlier this month, said he was ""pleased"" Wenger was staying ""as he is one of the very best coaches in Europe"". However, Usmanov added it was ""of paramount importance that he receives the full support of the board and majority shareholder"". The metals magnate owns 30% of Arsenal's shares but is not on the board and plays no part in the decision-making at the club. ""If the support is not forthcoming, we stand ready to step in and do everything we can to deliver success on and off the field,"" he added. Arsene staying is 'good news' - Lauren Arsenal a 'long way behind' - Lineker Can Arsene write a new chapter in Arsenal's history? Although Arsenal may have Â£100m to spend, the issue is that they already have a high wage bill and their revenues are not as large as Europe's very biggest clubs. And that's before you factor in dropping down from the Champions League to the Europa League. They need to be careful when it comes to Financial Fair Play, meaning they will inevitably have to sell some players to free up funds for wages rather than transfer fees. It will be a busy few months at the Emirates. Decision to stay:""I identify myself so much with the club. When you can be where you love to be, that's easy. It's difficult because you want to respond to the demands of all the people who love this club."" The fans:""Let's be together to support our players, to support the club and all give our absolute best to be at the level that we want to be. We can move up to the next level, I'm convinced of that, by having faith in the way we want to play football and by supporting the players we have already."" Kroenke:""Our ambitions are unlimited. We live in a very competitive world where you need the support of the owner. He's highly ambitious and supportive as well so, on that front, we are all united with exactly the same targets."" New signings:""We have a very heavy squad at the moment so maybe we might lose some players. We will work very hard to find the additions of top, top quality. I believe that our squad is very strong and we will only look for top-class people who can strengthen our team now."" This video can not be played Lack of respect towards me a disgrace - Wenger Wenger led the Gunners to three Premier League titles and four FA Cups in his first nine seasons in charge. In 2003-04, he became the first manager since 1888-89 to lead a team through an entire top-flight season unbeaten. But after winning the 2005 FA Cup, they had to wait another nine years - or 3,283 days - for their next silverware. It came as they beat Hull City to win the 2014 FA Cup, before winning the trophy again the following year. Arsenal are have not won the Premier League in 13 years and in 11 of those seasons have finished 10 or more points adrift of the champions. BBC Sport chief football writer Phil McNulty Arsenal have not qualified for the Champions League for the first time in 20 years - and many would believe an FA Cup triumph would be the perfect parting point, allowing Wenger to go out on a high and a successor to usher in the new era. Wenger does not think in those terms. He is the eternal optimist who has never felt Arsenal were far away from recreating a title-winning team, even though the evidence against has piled up before him. A section of Arsenal's support have organised protest marches and made their discontent clear as Wenger's side once again failed to halt a barren title sequence stretching back to ""The Invincibles"" season of 2003/04 - with the manager describing some of his treatment as ""a disgrace"". However, he is committed as ever, even after 1,175 games as Arsenal manager, 676 wins and a remarkable win percentage of 57.5% - but did Saturday start a new era of success that can emulate his early glories, or will he simply face the same criticism again at the first sign of trouble next season? This video can not be played 'Arsene Who?' - Wenger remembers joining Arsenal Match of the Day presenter and former England striker Gary Lineker:""Arsenal have got a long way to go at the moment. If you ask me now whether they are going to be in the top four next season, I would say most probably not. They are further behind than Wenger thinks. ""The only other example of a manager that decides when and where he goes is Sir Alex Ferguson, but he was still winning league titles. ""Arsene Wenger was still winning FA Cups and until this season he had always got in the top four, but now that's changed."" Former Arsenal goalkeeper Bob Wilson:""Without the Champions League, the only way is if you can compete salary-wise to attract the players. ""Chelsea bought the best player available last season in N'Golo Kante and Arsenal went for him too but came nowhere near the salary that Chelsea pay. ""Arsenal cannot compete with Manchester United, or Chelsea with all the money Roman Abramovich has, or Sheikh Mansour has at Manchester City - these are clubs who can manage to go into huge debt."" This video can not be played Arsenal have nucleus of really great squad - Wilson Arsenal Supporters' Trust spokesperson Tim Payton:""The reaction is very mixed - we recently surveyed our membership and 78% thought it was time for a change. ""We all want to see Arsenal win and we will get behind the team, but they need to get on top of this summer. They've got the contracts of star players Mesut Ozil and Alexis Sanchez ending and they've not got a good track record of being decisive and quick in the transfer market. ""No one should be abused but every supporter has a right to a voice and it is concerning to see Wenger challenging his own fans and if I look across the football world it's never ended well when a manger falls out with his supporters."" Arsenal Fan TV founder and presenter Robbie Lyle:""Now the announcement has been made, fans might start to get behind Wenger. ""It's all going to depend on what kind of summer Arsenal can have and whether they can bring in some transfers that excite the fans. We need to add to the squad but he do have a lot of quality players and it's vitally important to keep Ozil and Sanchez. ""But what about the first time we lose back-to-back games next season - if that happens, will the atmosphere become toxic again?"" We asked youon Sportsdayto complete the sentence above: Ally McIntosh:""He's purely in it to try and pass Sir Alex Ferguson's 26 years. Not to win things."" Si Hawkes:""We'll be having this same conversation in two years after he's signed yet another two-year deal."" James Tall:""Another two years of inconsistency and fan frustration."" Alex Maple:""More work for pilots of small planes and banner makers."" We also asked you on Tuesday to vote on whether Wenger staying is a good thing for Arsenal. There were more than 250,000 votes - 58% said yes and 42% said no.

"GB's Aljaz Bedene loses 3-6 3-6 6-4 3-6 to Jiri Vesely Rafael Nadal beats Haase 6-1 6-4 6-3 Djokovic beats Sousa in straight sets Muguruza through to women's third round Matthew Henry and Tom Rostance Vesely 6-3 6-3 4-6 6-3 Bedene So there are just two British players left standing. Andy Murray and Kyle Edmund. Both are in action tomorrow and we'll be back then to take you through it. See you then. Vesely 6-3 6-3 4-6 6-3 Bedene That's difficult to sum up for Aljaz Bedene. In the first two sets he was outclassed but after fighting back in the third he had a host of chances to take it to a decider. He just couldn't take any of them and in the end he is the third Briton to fall at this year's French Open. *Vesely 6-3 6-3 4-6 5-3 Bedene Heartbreak for Bedene. Match point. He thinks he has a winner to stay alive. The line judge agrees. But Vesely has a look at the mark in the clay and it shows the ball landed out. Bedene's face is a picture of disappointment. A tough way to lose. *Vesely 6-3 6-3 4-6 5-3 Bedene Oh Aljaz! This game should be over and in the Briton's favour he misses a smash at the net on break point. Both players are clearly feeling the pressure. A chance for the match goes by for Vesely. This game has lasted more than 11 minutes. Does either player want to win it? *Vesely 6-3 6-3 4-6 5-3 Bedene More good play from Bedene gets us back to deuce. He just can't produce the same tennis on the break points. Maybe this time? Vesely puts a volley wide and Bedene has another chance to keep himself in this... *Vesely 6-3 6-3 4-6 5-3 Bedene A risky drop shot from Bedene is gobbled up by Vesely. Here's his firstmatch point... *Vesely 6-3 6-3 4-6 5-3 Bedene The next two points are shared. Deuce. The crowd clap rhythmically in anticipation. *Vesely 6-3 6-3 4-6 5-3 Bedene Is Vesely nervous? Maybe. He double faults to hand Bedene another point. Top stuff from the Czech this time as he comes out on top of a 27-shot rally. 30-30. *Vesely 6-3 6-3 4-6 5-3 Bedene What can Bedene conjure up here? He must win this game. Excellent start. Backhand winner 0-15. Ace from Vesely. Can't do much with that. 15-15. *Vesely 6-3 6-3 4-6 5-3 Bedene Oh dear. Oh dear. Oh dear. Bedene double faults at the worst possible time. Is that it? Vesely is now serving for a place in the third round. Vesely 6-3 6-3 4-6 4-3 Bedene* Jiri Vesely hasn't come out on top of many lengthy rallies in this set but now he has and Bedene is under pressure on serve for the first time in a while. 0-30. Uh oh. The British number three nets. Two break points Vesely... Vesely 6-3 6-3 4-6 4-3 Bedene* That's the most comfortable hold for Vesely in this set. Bedene still managed to chip away at his opponent though, playing a lovely drop shot that will surely take more out of the legs of Vesely. A man in the crowd stands and applauds the point from the Briton. He was impressed. *Vesely 6-3 6-3 4-6 3-3 Bedene With him serving second in this fourth set there is a bit of pressure on Bedene every time he steps up to the baseline as he's always trailing until he can find that break. A 17-shot rally at 30-30 ends with a beautiful backhand winner from Bedene. Those just weren't landing in the first two sets. Bedene levels again. Vesely 6-3 6-3 4-6 3-2 Bedene* Vesely's game looked to have deserted him in this game but the serve returns to dig him out of trouble. Three games in a row now Britain's Bedene has had break points and he hasn't taken any of them. That surely has to be frustrating? *Vesely 6-3 6-3 4-6 2-2 Bedene Vesely is struggling now. First a double fault and then a forehand that barely gets halfway up the net. The crowd seem to be slightly in his favour and give him a cheer of encouragement. Here are two more break points for Aljaz Bedene... *Vesely 6-3 6-3 4-6 2-2 Bedene Many of you will not be familiar with Jiri Vesley but he is a tall chap, just two centimetres short of two metres, and he has to use all that height to reach a Bedene lob. He wins that point but gives away the other four with errors. A good, quick service game for Bedene. It was almost like he puffed his cheeks and said ""I'm feeling fine, Jiri. How are you?"" Vesely 6-3 6-3 4-6 2-1 Bedene* Big hold from Vesely. That will give him extra bounce as he heads to his chair. A quick couple of minutes to regain some energy. #bbctennis or 81111 Kyle Utterson:After seeing the first 2 sets I couldn't see a  comeback happening but all credit to Bedene for hanging in there. With the confidence Bedene has with the form he is in this year and with the momentum he has now, he has every chance  *Vesely 6-3 6-3 4-6 1-1 Bedene Another double fault from Vesely. A sign of tiredness in the legs? The errors are coming off his racquet far more often than in the early stages. A chance for Bedene, here's a break point. Bang. 130mph serve down the 'T' from Vesely. We're still at deuce in the longest game of this match so far... *Vesely 6-3 6-3 4-6 1-1 Bedene This court is almost fully in shade now as we head into late evening. If this one goes the distance I'd fancy Bedene, he looks the fresher player. Vesely tries to buy himself a little too much time between serves and receives a time violation from the umpire. A double fault from the Czech takes us to deuce. Another opening from Bedene? Â© 2025 BBC.

" “Kilnasaggart Bridge” was a whispered curse on the lips of train travellers in the days of Northern Ireland’s Troubles. It nudges up close to the border that separates the six counties of Ulster in the United Kingdom from the Republic of Ireland. The bridge was such a popular target for IRA bombers that uninterrupted travel from north to south was often impossible. A groan would go up as the tinny tannoy announced that, because of problems on the line, all passengers would disembark at the Newry halt, travel by bus across the border and then clamber back on the train at Dundalk in the Republic of Ireland. We trundled on, we trundled off. It added at least an hour and more like two to the journey. So much for the “express”. But at least we knew we had crossed the border. Now, commuters sip posh coffee and sail past this once troubled spot, blissfully unaware of where the north ends, and where the Republic of Ireland begins. The border is there, but it is not there and the bombs are history. Drive along the modern motorway that links Belfast to Dublin and the only clue that you have crossed is the subtle switch from signposts in miles to those in kilometres. Keen-eyed, you might spot the change in the markings on the sides of the road. It is a child’s guessing game - north or south, are we there, aren’t we here? About 50 years ago, it was easier. The good roads were in Northern Ireland - you knew you had hit the Republic when the potholes rattled the car. The road signs in the south were more dramatic than the north. They came in sets and block capitals: SLOW; SLOWER; SLOWER STILL. The Killeen border checkpoint near Newry, 1987 This border is 310 miles (499km) long and meanders from Carlingford Lough in the east to Lough Foyle in the west. It was never a neat line. It is a squiggle across the map of Ireland – like an awkward child taking their crayon for a walk. That line divides rivers, slices fields, cuts bridges in two and even, occasionally, divides the odd house. Carlingford Lough marks the easternmost point of the border There are homes where you can have your breakfast in the north and go to sleep in the south. There are places where mobile phone reception in just one house fluctuates between north and south. The days of the Troubles are behind us - days lived in the dark shadow of watchtowers and turrets are vanished. But now the UK is getting ready to leave the EU, and the people of the borderlands are uneasy. Up to 35,000 people commute across the border every day. Hospital patients and schoolchildren and cross-border workers are among those who have to make the daily journey. None of them wants a hard border, but the EU has stressed that there will have to be some form of customs control. What is a “soft” border? Will thousands of people find themselves cursing daily in long queues at border points? The village of Muff lies close to the border between Donegal and County Londonderry. During the Troubles, cars queued at the Army checkpoint, where twitchy young soldiers with rifles rattled out the usual questions. Where are you coming from? Where are you going to? Get out and open your boot, sir. Then it was on down a twist in the road and the Irish customs men were on their marks waiting to catch the locals with the contraband. Now, you’d hardly know you were crossing. A black corrugated hut at the old customs post is boarded up - weeds sprout from the chimney. Over the bridge and you’re into the one-street village. It is tiny but boasts four petrol stations. The Derry-Donegal crossing point at Muff There is what used to be an old Irish ballroom - a big, squat building called Borderland. When Derry city burned in riots and bombings, Borderland was the escape – the dance hall down the road, where you jived your way into another world. Marie Lindsay was born in Muff, but the city of Derry is centre stage in her heart. She lives in the hills just outside the village and has a foot in both camps. Each morning she gets into her car in Donegal, in the Republic, and drives up through a little wood. Then it’s on through a housing estate and into Derry, where she’s principal of a girls' school, St Mary’s College. Marie Lindsay, principal of St Mary's College, Derry She has lived her life along this border. Like thousands of others, she feels she has a double identity. Marie Lindsay in the art room at St Mary's College “I’m Donegal, born and bred. Donegal is in my DNA, but Derry is my home city, I feel I belong there,” she says. Her journey to work is seamless these days – down what was once an “unapproved” road - spiked, so that people could not drive across. As the Troubles in Northern Ireland escalated in the 1970s, the Army and police blocked and cratered the smaller roads to make all but the approved checkpoint routes impassable, and to stop paramilitaries crossing. Lindsay has known a hard border - the interminable waits at checkpoints. They were dark days that no-one really wants to recall. She has now grown used to peace and the ease of life. The spot marking the border is often nearly invisible On the evening drive home from work, she points out the spot where you have crossed. “The road signs switch from miles to kilometres, the road markings change, but that’s it,” she says. She carries two purses – a sterling purse for the north and a euro purse for the south. But both sides take each other’s currency at a decent rate. Many people carry two mobile phones – one north, one south. Talk to any of the girls in St Mary’s, says Lindsay, and you’ll soon find they have roots in Donegal – a granny in Malin, an aunty from Carndonagh. All down the years, city dwellers have taken a Sunday drive from Northern Ireland over the border to feast their eyes on the beauty of Five Fingers Strand, to nurse a pint in Buncrana, to treat the children to a ride on the swing boats by the shore. But the links amount to much more than a Sunday stroll. There are good schools in the city of Derry and the health service is free. Many people in Donegal send their children to school north of the border or are treated by the National Health Service -  some officially, some unofficially. There are pressing questions about students. Many from Northern Ireland travel to university in Dublin, Galway and Cork. Others from the Republic of Ireland cross the border to go to Queen’s in Belfast and to Derry’s Magee College and the North West Regional College. Magee College campus, Derry Lindsay is also concerned for the Donegal students who cross the border to go to the city’s further education college. “They could end up having to make the 40-minute drive to Letterkenny whereas before it was just 10 to 15 minutes into college in Derry.” On 23 June, 76p bought you one euro, but by the second week after the Brexit vote, that figure had shot up to 86p. It would reach a high of 90p last October, before falling back slightly since. For all those living in Donegal and working in Derry, the value of their sterling pay packets has plunged. In recent years, Lindsay’s Donegal village has played host to young families from Northern Ireland, lured by affordable housing. It has been a breath of fresh air – new life for the local primary school, tills ringing in the shops, a bustling community in the border village. But Brexit is making border folk start to think twice. Betty Holmes, Donegal Action for Cancer Care Betty Holmes is a member of Donegal Action for Cancer Care. The group is based in the Republic of Ireland but campaigns to access nearby health facilities in Northern Ireland. She is passionate about getting the best cancer care close at hand. It’s a deeply personal campaign. Her father died of lung cancer a week after her seventh birthday - he had never smoked. Her mother died from breast cancer three years later. When a new state-of-the-art radiotherapy centre opened recently in Altnagelvin Hospital, Derry, there was a sigh of relief from families on both sides of the border. No more two-hour treks over the mountain pass from Derry to Belfast for those living with cancer in Northern Ireland’s western region. No more five-hour treks from Donegal to Galway for cancer patients living in the Republic of Ireland. “It is a good 308km to Galway and what sort of a journey is that when there is radiotherapy sitting a few miles across the border?” asks Holmes. The journey to Altnagelvin Hospital is as little as 45 minutes from the top end of Donegal at Malin Head, she says. The Irish government has invested in the new services in Northern Ireland. The Prince of Wales opened Altnagelvin's new cancer centre earlier this month Agreements in place between the UK and Irish governments mean there are currently places for 385 cancer patients coming across the border. But Brexit weighs heavily on Betty Holmes’s mind. “Our concern is what happens in three to five years when the real effect of Brexit is starting to be felt,” she says. If you are the parent of one of the children from Northern Ireland who would travel to Dublin for paediatric cardiac care, then you might be asking what impact Brexit could have for those children?” “Will the Irish government be in a position to pay what [is set] down as the cost of treating a cancer patient at Altnagelvin? Will that number be reduced from 385 to 200 initially and will it go down from there?” The sharing of medical services across the border is not a one-way street. “If you are the parent of one of the children from Northern Ireland who would travel to Dublin for paediatric cardiac care, then you might be asking what impact Brexit could have for those children?” Ciaran Crilly woke up to the news of Brexit last June  and immediately worried about his business. Just up from Cloughoge church on the Newry border, where the Army posts once cast long shadows on the high hill, is the sweet factory – a family business set up in the 1970s. Ten years before that Ciaran Crilly’s father, Peter, left for a sugary fact-finding mission, taking in the Mars factory in Slough, and then Blackpool to uncover the secret of getting the name through the stick of rock. In the 1970s, as the Troubles raged in Northern Ireland, he came home, put his head down and set up a business. Now his son has the reins. Before Spanish holidays were the norm, the Crillys made seaside rock, selling it from Portrush in Northern Ireland to Bundoran and Bray in the Republic. This was the time when traditional sweets - bags of clove rock, bull’s eyes and brandy balls - still cast their spell. On both sides of the border, they still love their sweets. But Brexit was a blow. “It was terrible. Our business has been going superbly this last 10 years, year-on-year growth, no issues. Then you have this shock and you ask why did it need to happen?” Ciaran Crilly, Crillys Sweets The company was doing 75% of its business with the Republic of Ireland. When the UK exits Europe, if a trade deal isn’t reached, it could potentially face a 30% tariff in line with World Trade Organisation rules. That would be a worst-case scenario, says Crilly, but possible. For a while, Crilly considered upping sticks and moving a few miles down the road to set up in the Republic. Instead, they decided to stay put and look at new markets. In January, Crilly’s Sweets had a stand at a trade show in Germany and picked up business in Australia and China. They have been inundated with requests. Every emigrant craves the comforting taste of home. “We gained a lot of business through expats in Australia. People miss the kola cubes, pear drops, clove rock, mixed balls and even the jelly babies and wine gums,” he says. And, given the response from across the globe, perhaps Brexit could prove a blessing. But it’s an anxious time. “Half of our staff are from EU countries, such as Latvia and Poland. Will they stay?” Crilly doesn’t know. Drive on for an hour along the border and it’s sheep day at Enniskillen mart. The yard is a long line of muddy Land Rovers hauling trailers full of sheep and ewes. Men in flat caps, jeans and wellington boots meander about. Denzil Brady is 84 but wiry and keen-eyed. In all his years working on his father's farm in the hills around Enniskillen, he has had little time for the European Union. Denzil Brady “They're the greatest set of rogues in Brussels,” he says. “They have farms nearly out of business with the whole pile of paperwork. “With all those regulations, I fear for the young farmers in their 40s and how they'll suffer lives of misery.” Hugh Maguire has a different view. He has farmed for more than 50 years up by the famous Marble Arch Caves. His land straddles the border and he's had his share of headaches. He has cows and sheep, but some of them belong to the north and some belong to the Republic. It makes for two sets of paperwork and a few headaches. Woe betide the Irish sheep that sets a hoof over the border and vice versa. But Maguire believes the EU did a lot of good and Brexit is not welcome. He remembers the old days of smuggling across the border. He remembers the hard border, the checkpoints and queues and he just asks himself what lies ahead now. It could be a big step backwards, he says. “Farmers cannot farm without the European single farm payment,” he says. This is the agricultural subsidy payment, based on the area of a farmer's land, to offset the cost of producing food. James Johnston is the mart director - it's a family business that goes back to his grandfather's day. He's a young man and he admits that, personally, he is no fan of Europe. At its heart, [the EU]'s quite an undemocratic system. So I can understand reasons for pulling out.” “The EC originally was very good in terms of promoting free trade and promoting peace and security within Europe. “But I do think it has overstepped the mark as it has grown. Legislation-wise, it has just mushroomed. At its heart, it's quite an undemocratic system. So I can understand reasons for pulling out,”  he says. “However, where we are, here in this part of Ireland, in Fermanagh, we border with four of the southern counties, an open border is absolutely critical to peace and general well-being on both sides - free movement of people and goods.” Johnston argues that it must be maintained, however Brexit pans out. He'd like a more open border with the Republic of Ireland even than exists now. “It's exceptionally difficult, virtually impossible to bring livestock across the border, sell them in this mart and for traders to buy them and bring them home again. “It's easier for us to send cattle from the mart here to England and Scotland after a sale than to send them 10 or 12 miles down the road a stone's throw away across the southern border.” The problem lies with animal health and biosecurity, he says. Different policies exist on each side of the border. And now there will be more change. For farmers, the best-case scenario would be a post-Brexit free trade agreement, says Phelim O'Neill, a markets specialist for the Irish Farmers Journal. The worst-case scenario would see a very heavy tariff on agriculture products traded between the UK and the EU. “In terms of where will hit hard for Northern Ireland, somewhere between a quarter and a third of milk produced in Northern Ireland dairy farms goes to Ireland for processing,” he says. “So if you are one of those farmers, your milk will be hit with a very high tariff – it would not be viable to send it. “It is the same for sheep. About 400,000 sheep each year go from NI to factories in Ireland for processing. If the WTO tariffs apply, then it simply would not be viable.” Colm McKenna People who own petrol stations along the border know all about boom and bust - trade depends on currency fluctuations and significantly lower fuel duty rates in the Republic of Ireland. Enda McColgan, manager of the Texaco in Muff, says 90% of the garage’s customers come from Northern Ireland to top up. Business is booming. There was one stage when demand was so great they even had to employ somebody to manage the traffic on the road outside. Enda McColgan: Business is booming Garage owner Colm McKenna remembers bombings, the checkpoints and the days of soldiers in ditches. “If we had a hard border then we’d be going back 30 years in six weeks to six months,” he says. It’s not hard to imagine who might target such a border, he points out. Some have warned that a hard border could be used as a justification for violence by dissident republicans who do not support the current peace agreements in Northern Ireland. Kevin Melarkey Not far away, at another crossing, Kevin Melarkey is the egg man on the border at Bridgend near Derry. He's there at the farm shop seven days a week - in a small hut - selling eggs and bags of spuds. He has a good thick coat and a pair of mountain boots to keep out the cold. When he gets a minute, he can stand outside his hut and rest his eyes on the blue hills of Donegal. He's too young to remember much more than the queues at the checkpoints on a Sunday when half of the city decamped across the border to Buncrana or to buy cheap petrol. Like everyone else, he does not know what Brexit will bring. “We're in limbo, it's just a waiting game,” he sighs. Brexit and border changes will be more significant for Northern Ireland, says Katie Daughen, head of Brexit Research and Support Services to the British/Irish Chamber of Commerce. Every year 31% of NI exports are to the Republic and 27% of its imports come from there. The main sector to be affected is food and agriculture. “It’s worth over £4.5bn to the economy in the north and it’s by far the most exposed.” Katie Daughen: Changes will be more significant north of the border Daughen lists a couple of examples of the all-island nature of the economy: • Wheat grown in the south is processed in north•    40% of chicken produced in the south is processed in the north One of Ireland’s most famous exports faces similar problems. Guinness is brewed in Dublin in the Republic of Ireland. But it’s sent north of the border to be bottled or canned before returning to Dublin for export to the world. But it is not all doom and gloom.  There are opportunities out there too. The border’s disappearance was a gradual shift - like ice melting. After the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, things moved slowly. But the dragon’s teeth  - ugly concrete blocks squatting on hundreds of country roads linking north and south -  were suddenly yanked. The soldiers in their camouflage passed out of view. In 2003, they took away the checkpoint at Newry. They pulled down the ugly iron cage, the military turret high on the hill above the church at Cloughoge. The tower above Cloughoge The people who felt safer for the presence of the Army on the hilltop called it a watchtower. Those who resented the Army, and their high power cameras, preferred “spy post”. It was close to that Newry border where Lord Justice Gibson and his wife Cecily were killed by an IRA bomb in 1987. 1987: Wreckage from the explosion which killed Lord Justice Gibson and his wife A year later, Robin and Maureen Hanna and their son, David, six, died in an IRA explosion after crossing the border. The family from Hillsborough in the north were returning from holiday when their vehicle was mistaken for one belonging to a senior judge. The big military turret went up on the hill after that. It was a stretch of road that became a no-man’s land between north and south. It was not a place for a friendly chat - there was tension in the air, the soldiers were edgy. Crossings were never easy. Many resented the waiting and the questioning. People were afraid they might get caught up, a sitting target for a bomber. Or scared that a soldier might even get trigger happy. But there was another side to the old border too. The game of “catch me if you can” with the customs officers still raises a smile. A customs post on the Belfast-Dublin road in the 1950s Butter was cheaper  on one side – hide it in the pram and sit the child on top. It was all the sweeter for being illicit. Young couples from the north took the train to Dublin to buy the wedding ring. There are tales of dangling the ring out of the train window on a thread on the way home to evade the keen eye of the customs man. In Fermanagh, drive down past the town of Enniskillen and on to the border towns of Belcoo and Blacklion and you see how past and present merge. The stone bridge marks the crossing point between north and south. The bus stop in Belcoo has two sets of signs – a blue and white sign for the Ulsterbus and a green one with a greyhound for Bus Éireann. The street signs are in both English and Irish. Harold Johnston has an old-fashioned shop just over the bridge in Blacklion. His grandmother opened it in 1901. “She was a trained seamstress and had five dressmakers upstairs at one time. She used to do wedding dresses and red flannel petticoats.” A century later, her grandson presides over an Aladdin’s cave. It is a drapery and a clothes shop and a wool shop and whatever you like. The shoe boxes are piled high, there are rolls of oilskin tablecloth propped up. From the door, Johnston can look left to where the customs post and Irish gardaí once stood, checking the cars coming south. “There were 43 guards and six sergeants at that border,” he says. “We had 24-hour cover and two shifts. We had patrol cars patrolling the back roads. “They were stationed in the barracks on the left.  The young lads were sent up from Dublin for training along the border.” In the 1930s, the Depression hit hard but on 3 September 1939 trade exploded on his side of the bridge when war was declared. “They were putting restrictions in the north and it was scarcity this and scarcity that. But we had lots of butter and sugar.” Harold Johnston Smuggling was rife. Johnston tells a story about the undertaker in Blacklion in the Republic who was running short on shrouds, but had a friend across the border in Belcoo who knew another man that could get him some. The problem was getting them over the bridge from north to south. “Yer man came into the bar in Blacklion and said the parcel had arrived and he had it with him,” Johnston says. “So he went into the kitchen and he had on a coat three times too big and he opened it and he had put all the shrouds on himself and walked over the border like that. “As he took the shrouds off in the kitchen at the back, yer man looked at him and said: ‘It’s the first time I’ve ever seen a man taking a shroud off’.” During the Troubles, there were just 20 official border crossings between Northern Ireland and the Republic. The British Army shut down, spiked or cratered the rest. With peace, the country relaxed, breathed a sigh of relief, and unspiked the roads. Trade and business became more fluid – it blossomed. Businesses in Northern Ireland set up offices in the Republic and vice versa. Seamus Leheny from the Northern Ireland Freight Transport Association knows the pain of those whose businesses may be disrupted by Brexit. An Irish revenue commissioner has said up to 8% of freight crossing the border might be subject to checks after Brexit. With a minimum of 6,000 lorries trundling over the border every day, you begin to see the scale of the problem. “That makes at least 500 lorries that could be checked every day,"" says Leheny. ""Added to that is the thought that drivers selected for checking might have to drive away from the main flow of traffic to a specific post – and distance costs money. Even if there are to be checks it doesn't necessarily follow that there will be a string of traditional border posts with long queues of lorries. The head of the Irish tax authorities has said he is ""practically 100% certain"" there will be no new customs posts along the border after Brexit. Niall Cody said businesses, however, must assume there will be “some form of customs” post-Brexit - it might be that people would be allowed to make declarations online. Ongoing analysis of cross-border trade increasingly shows that most goods transported between the jurisdictions will not need to be physically checked, Cody suggested. Still, there are those who might be less than scrupulous and could take advantage by shipping goods into Belfast and straight into the EU via Dublin – without paying the tariffs. Then, think about the large retailers who treat the island of Ireland as an entity – one market. They get the goods to Belfast, use distribution centres to sort and store, and send them on by lorry on to Galway, Cork and Dublin. “They may ship directly rather than go through a whole bureaucratic process. Jobs could be lost in Northern Ireland,” Leheny says. Eamon O'Farrell, a former customs officer in Donegal who spent 30 years patrolling the border, says the Irish authorities are “ill equipped” to deal with border checks. It's not the main roads, it's the hundreds of unapproved roads. “I cannot figure out how they're going to do this with the resources that I understand they have,” he says. “You wouldn't get 12 people across the whole border who know where the actual border is. We're talking about the revenue risk, tax evasion, various types of smuggling - goods and people.” On the ground, people are thinking ahead. There are cross-border meetings and countless committees working out the logistics of a border that is longer than the length of the island of Ireland. At government level, civil servants in London are getting their heads around the conundrum of Northern Ireland. One thing that looks likely to continue is the Common Travel Area (CTA), the bilateral UK-Ireland agreement that allows for free movement of UK and Irish citizens between Ireland, Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. The arrangement allows Irish and UK citizens the right to work, to access public services and to vote in certain elections, and Brexit Secretary David Davis has described the continuation of the CTA as ""non-negotiable"". Jane Morrice, former head of the European Commission office in Northern Ireland, helped broker the Good Friday Agreement during her time as a politician. She wants to maintain the status quo on the island of Ireland. She is proposing that Northern Ireland should have honorary membership of the EU after the UK's departure. “We've made such good progress since the Good Friday Agreement. Removing the border and removing borders in mind as well as geographically has been hugely successful and we cannot allow ourselves to halt that or reverse it in any way,” she says. “The role played by the EU in the peace process was instrumental.” Border dwellers are hardy as the weeds and thistles sprouting from the old huts at the customs posts. They have come through partition and war and the Troubles. Harold Johnston tells the story of a villager in the 1920s who travelled up the road to Enniskillen in Northern Ireland for his groceries every week. Partition hit home on the very day of his weekly shop. On his return journey, a fresh new customs hut had sprung up at the border and a man in a starched uniform was waiting for him. “You can’t bring those goods into the Free State,” said the customs man. “But I always have,” said the man. “Well, you can’t now,” said the new officer. The man turned back for a sit and a think in nearby Belcoo, Northern Ireland. What did he do? Johnston pauses and smiles. “He sat and waited for the customs officer to shut up shop for the night and sure didn’t he just walk over the border.” There is always a way.

"The Islamic State militant group (IS) is fighting on many fronts against those seeking to defeat it. One of those fronts is a digital one. Its use of social media has been thrown into the spotlight again after it used messaging app Telegram to claim responsibility for Saturday night's terror attack in London. IS puts media warfare on a par with its battle on the ground and often glorifies ""media martyrs"" - people who are killed while creating videos and other digital content for the group. Like many other such groups, IS has been an enthusiastic user of social media and the web, broadcasting propaganda about its successes and using it as a recruitment tool. Although a long-time user of social media, IS activities took a significant turn in September 2015 when the group's official media outlets took to Telegram. The move to the encrypted messaging service came after a long-running conflict with Twitter, which regularly shut down IS accounts, and some experimentation with less well-known platforms from which it was also expelled. The timing was significant because that was the moment when Telegram set up the ""channel"" feature, letting users broadcast to an unlimited number of other users - a tool that many online jihadists were quick to exploit. IS's official outlet logo, Nashir, (L) and Nashir News Agency's logo (R) The move to Telegram did not go unnoticed and IS went underground in August 2016 after its official accounts were repeatedly suspended. But IS media operatives set up lots of separate channels that simply repeated or mirrored what appeared on the official channel. These channels simultaneously stream material produced by IS's central media operation, including its self-styled news agency Amaq, and are described as being dedicated to distributing official IS news. The mirror channels, called the Nashir News Agency, have also regularly been suspended. To circumvent this, their administrators use a stealthy approach in which they set up a user or channel and allow it to build up a substantial following before suddenly switching it to the easily recognisable IS mirror brand. The channels continuously promote new join-up links for their proliferating replica versions, calling on IS supporters to distribute them further. Some channels, whose promotion on popular social media platforms is prohibited, are designed to maintain a lower profile to avoid suspension. IS supporters enjoy relative freedom to post material on Telegram This enables them to attract a significant number of followers but the channels are usually removed before this exceeds 1,000. Such numbers suffice to get IS's message out for distribution by online supporters. Prominent pro-IS figures reliably stream the group's propaganda alongside other content. But IS's strong media branding renders the group's material easily recognisable among other fare. This was seen on Sunday, when the IS news outlet Amaq said on Telegram that ""a security unit of Islamic State fighters carried out the London attacks of yesterday"". Telegram does not allow comprehensive searches of public content, which means that the number of pro-jihad users cannot be accurately gauged. Nashir agency boasted that it had 100 replica channels on Telegram In mid-April, the Nashir agency published a poster congratulating itself on setting up 100 mirror accounts - and there are now said to be more than 130. This was shortly followed by a campaign to celebrate 12 months of Nashir agency's operation. As part of the campaign, the outlet called for admirers and readers to send in articles and images praising its work, which they did in large numbers. These promotional campaigns appeared to be an effort to buoy morale among IS supporters who enjoy relative freedom to post material on Telegram. The BBC has asked Telegram to comment on IS-related activity on its service but has not received a reply. Telegram has advertised its daily efforts to take down pro-IS channels since December last year. Nashir agency recently trumpeted the anniversary of its online presence In another recent move, Nashir agency has switched from just being a mouthpiece for IS to urging its followers on Telegram to spread content via Twitter and Facebook. It has advertised its own accounts on those platforms, which have repeatedly been suspended. It has also launched accounts on Instagram and set up English-language feeds for the first time. Five people were killed in the Westminster attack The outlet now posts IS material in Arabic and English translation via its main feeds - the latest step of an initiative to post in English that began after the Westminster attack on 22 March. These moves by Nashir agency to expand its reach have followed criticism by IS supporters on Telegram that pro-IS channels were preaching to the converted and should step up their efforts on other platforms. IS has sought to cultivate the commitment of virtual foot-soldiers by highlighting their importance in its war. IS supporters are encouraged to spread the group's propaganda on popular social media platforms Charlie Winter of the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation and Political Violence (ICSR) acknowledges the success IS has had with Telegram. He says the messaging service's action against pro-IS channels ""seems to be very haphazard"". Home Secretary Amber Rudd has also named Telegram among tech firms she wants to be tougher on pro-jihad users. Mr Winter adds that IS's efforts to expose unsuspecting audiences to its propaganda on other, more popular platforms now meet with much less success. IS might regularly post content specifically designed for Twitter, but this attempt at ""amplification"" no longer goes well, he says. The group is still most successful on Telegram but its reliance on it could come at a cost, as supporters flock to the app instead of pushing the IS message to audiences elsewhere.

"The concert, which features Justin Bieber and Grande, will be broadcast on BBC One A benefit concert in aid of the victims of the Manchester bombing is being organised for Sunday, but how much work goes into planning an event in so little time? ""To be honest, it's possibly the hardest task I've ever had to undertake,"" says Melvin Benn in an interview with the BBC about the One Love Manchester concert he is co-producing. Benn, boss of Live Nation subsidiary Festival Republic, is the man behind some of the UK's biggest music festivals, including  Latitude, Reading and Leeds, Wireless and Download. ""We started the conversations on Friday evening, here we are on Wednesday and the concert is on Sunday. It's eight-and-a-half days to put it together. It's an incredible amount of work,"" he says. Stars to join Grande for Manchester gig Talent final moved to avoid Grande clash Fans' concerns over Ariana Grande tickets Everything you need to know about the concert One Love takes place at the Emirates Old Trafford in Manchester on Sunday, and will feature in its line-up Justin Bieber, Coldplay, Katy Perry, Miley Cyrus, Pharrell Williams, Usher, Take That and Niall Horan. Ariana Grande will also perform for the first time since last Monday, when 22 people were killed and 116 injured in asuicide bombingafter a concert she played a concert at Manchester Arena. Coldplay will also perform at the concert this Sunday Free tickets are being offered to those who attended the original gig, with proceeds from sales to the general public raising money for Red Cross's Manchester Emergency Fund. ""Clearly there are some families suffering bereavement or who have family members in hospital, and we're trying to do as much as we can to look after them as a priority, as well as all the rest of the fans that came,"" Benn says. ""We felt offering free tickets to everybody that was there on that night was the minimum we could do. The rest of the people that are coming will be the people who will be providing the money for the fundraising, but for those fans that were there we felt this was a good way of honouring those that lost their lives."" The gig will naturally require a great deal of logistical organisation, but Benn says ""everybody is pulling together"". Miley Cyrus will join Katy Perry and The Black Eyed Peas at Sunday's concert ""Greater Manchester Police, Trafford Borough Council, Manchester City Council, Transport for Greater Manchester, all pulling in the same direction to make this work, as well as the music industry and all the pop stars, it's incredible really,"" he says. ""The way Manchester has responded [to the attack] has been phenomenal, and I think that's been part of the inspiration for Ariana, to want to come back so quickly.""

"The Green Party is proposing a maximum four-day week. It's one of the policies included in theGreen Guarantee,external. The first thing to say is that it's not quite as radical as it sounds - the maximum number of hours worked a week would be 35, which is the same as has applied in France since 2000, although the exceptions in the French system mean that their average number of hours worked per week is actually a bit above 35,according to the OECD,external. Also, we already have a number of four-day weeks each year thanks to bank holidays. Explaining the policy on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show last month, Green Party co-leader Caroline Lucas said: ""I think there's a lot of evidence that suggests that when people are exhausted their productivity goes down. ""People are working ever more hours, getting ever more stressed, getting ever more ill-health - mental health problems as well."" The manifesto also said that the 35-hour week would be phased in. In the UK, the current limit is 48 hours a week, although you can opt out of it and various jobs are excluded. This video can not be played Should we work a four day week? Theaverage number of paid hours,externalworked by full-time employees in the UK in 2016 was 39.2. While it is relatively straightforward to impose a maximum number of hours worked in the week for employees, it is harder to do so for the self-employed and harder still to legislate to force people to work a four-day week, especially because not everybody could take the same days off and there would presumably need to be some flexibility about when the hours were worked. The idea is that working fewer hours would boost productivity, which is the value created by each hour worked. The UK has comparatively low productivity. The UK's national income per hour worked is 22.7% below that of France, which means that if we could be as productive as the French then we could work a four-day week and not lose much output. There are varioussuggestions in the parties' manifestoson what to do about UK productivity. Trying to boost productivity by reducing hours worked would not be without its costs. France has higher unemployment than the UK. It is likely that its more restrictive labour laws have meant that companies have invested more in machinery to reduce the number of people they need. Also, aworking paper from the International Monetary Fund,externalsuggested that the 35-hour week in France had reduced employment and not made workers any happier. But it's not just about maintaining economic growth - part of the idea of the four-day week is that to create a more sustainable economy we need to stop being obsessed by growth and start thinking about having a lower impact on the environment. The left of centre think tank, the New Economics Foundation, did some work on the idea of a more radical21-hour working week,external. It said that in addition to reducing environmental impact, a 21-hour week would distribute work more evenly across the population, reducing both the problems of over-work and unemployment, as well as evening up the amount of unpaid work done by men and women. It identified potential problems with the introduction of such a system such as increased poverty by reducing the number of hours worked by low-paid workers and increased unemployment. Some businesses would also be likely to resent the extra regulation. The Green Party maintains that working fewer hours would reduce stress and ill-health.

"Four international investment groups have called on investors to quit the tobacco industry. Axa, Calpers, Scor and AMP Capital have already sold or are selling their tobacco investments. The companies launched their appeal on the annual World No Tobacco Day (WNTD). Along with 50 other firms with investments totalling $3.8tn, they have pledged ""to openly support the tobacco control measures being taken by governments around the world"". Thestatement,externalreads: ""We in the investment community are becoming increasingly aware of the important role we can play in helping to address the health and societal impacts of tobacco. ""We strive within our own scope of action to support the ambition of the World Health Organisation (WHO) in line with our commitment to the positive role finance can play in sustainable development more broadly."" Last year, when Axa announced it was selling its tobacco investments, its chief executive Thomas Buberl told the BBC: ""The business case is positive. It makes no sense for us to continue our investments within the tobacco industry. The human cost of tobacco is tragic - its economic cost is huge."" A growing industry WNTD is one of eight official global public health campaigns marked by the WHO. ItsTobacco Fact Sheet,externalexplains: ""Tobacco kills more than seven million people each year. More than six million of those deaths are the result of direct tobacco use, while around 890,000 are the result of non-smokers being exposed to second-hand smoke. ""Nearly 80% of the world's more than one billion smokers live in low and middle-income countries."" In the developing world, tobacco markets are still growing, largely through ignorance of the dangers.A 2009 survey in China,externalrevealed that only 38% of smokers knew that smoking caused coronary heart disease and only 27% knew that it caused strokes. WNTD is the only one of the WHO's health campaigns that pits itself against a specific industry. The tobacco business remains a formidable adversary.  It has been one of the best investments of the last decade, indeed possibly of the post-Second World War era. The shares in companies listed in the Bloomberg tobacco producers index have risen 351% since 2009, compared with just over 101% for the MSCI global index. A 2009 survey in China showed only 38% of smokers knew that smoking causes coronary heart disease Despite the growing aversion of the big investors, many believe there is more growth to come. Dan Caplinger, of the financial services company The Motley Fool, wrote in January: ""As a new year begins, there are reasons to believe that 2017 could be a great year to invest in tobacco stocks."" He goes on to explain that mergers and a move into non-traditional tobacco products, such as e-cigarettes and""heat-not-burn"" tobacco products,external, could boost share prices further. The success of the industry is all the more remarkable, bearing in mind the forces ranged against Big Tobacco. These include multinational agencies, lobby groups, governments and the global medical establishment, as well as the stark fact, as formulated by the WHO, that ""tobacco kills up to half of its users"". The regulations are getting tighter, specifically in the way companies can advertise tobacco products. Even so, only 29 countries, representing just 12% of the world's population, have completely banned all forms of tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship. For instance, the European Union's Tobacco Products Directive forced tobacco companies to cover 65% of their packets with health warnings and clamped down on e-cigarette advertising. The tobacco companies have fought back, complaining that they are being unlawfully deprived of the right to display their brands. But last month, they lost a High Court challenge in the UK against new plain packaging rules. These mean all cigarette packets must now look the same, with the same green colour, font, size, case and alignment of text on boxes. The move by investors against tobacco is part of a wider trend in so-called ethical investing, which seems to be gathering pace. The US-based Forum for Sustainable and Responsible Investmentestimates that there has been 33% growth in what it calls sustainable, responsible and impact investing,external(SRI) over the past two years, and a 14-fold increase since 1995. Its 2016 report says: ""SRI investing continues to expand - now accounting for more than one out of every $5 under professional management in the United States."" The report is only talking about US-domiciled assets, but that's still $8.72tn. Of that, $1.97tn is invested with specific instructions to avoid tobacco and alcohol.

"Ian Paterson has been jailed after being convicted of intentionally wounding patients Breast surgeon Ian Paterson is beginning a jail sentence after being convicted of intentionally wounding patients and carrying out unnecessary operations. Here, more of his victims share their stories. Lisa Lloyd had two operations to remove her milk ducts Lisa Lloyd was 31 when she experienced a nipple bleed. She underwent two operations in 2007 to remove her milk ducts, at the private Spire Parkway Hospital, after being told by Paterson they could be pre-cancerous growths. The procedure left her unable to breastfeed. Years later when Mrs Lloyd was pregnant with her second child, she went for a check-up where a scan picked up something in her right breast. She was advised by Paterson to go under the knife - a procedure, she says, which would have put her unborn child at risk. ""I spoke to my specialist and they said you would probably wait, because it wasn't a definite cancer diagnosis, it was just that there was something there. ""For the rest of my pregnancy I was thinking, 'will it turn into full-blown cancer?', and I'm going to die and not see my girls. It really spoilt the latter part of the pregnancy. Mrs Lloyd was operated on at Spire Parkway Hospital in Solihull ""I think if I had had the operation at 22 or 24 weeks and gone into labour, she wouldn't have survived."" An ultrasound after the birth discovered the growth had disappeared. A sonographer put it down to ""hormones"". Mrs Lloyd, 42, from Redditch, Worcestershire, later discovered that the second milk duct removal procedure and subsequent six-monthly check ups had been unnecessary. ""Some people said it was acting like God, but I think it was for financial gain,"" she said. ""I just can't believe he would put people at risk. ""What he was prepared to do to me while I was pregnant, I will never forget."" Ian Paterson: Breast surgeon 'played God' with women's bodies Surgeon was 'psychopathic like Shipman' Breast surgeon Ian Paterson needlessly harmed patients Gill Dallow lost 11 pints of blood during a routine laparoscopy Gill Dallow was one of Paterson's earliest victims. During a routine laparoscopy in 1996, Paterson cut through an artery, causing her to lose 11 pints of blood and be on a life-support machine for three days. ""Apparently he went in so hard he bounced off my spine,"" she said. ""[The scalpel] hit the bone, that's how hard he went in. No wonder he went through everything."" Yet despite being suspended by managers at Sutton Coldfield's Good Hope Hospital following an investigation into the incident, Paterson was still taken on in 1998 by Solihull Hospital, where he would go on to operate on hundreds of patients. A2013 report by legal expert Sir Ian Kennedy,externalfound that when Paterson was appointed by Heart of England NHS Trust - which ran Solihull Hospital - a senior manager at Good Hope telephoned a Heart of England medical director to alert him to Paterson. It is unclear whether these details were passed on to those appointing Paterson, who wanted to recruit him to help clear a backlog of surgery. A review had been commissioned by the Royal College of Surgeons, which recommended that Paterson should undergo a period of supervised practice before recommencing unsupervised laparoscopic surgery. This was completed and Paterson returned to unsupervised practice. ""We were told he was going to have to be supervised for everything that he did,"" said Mrs Dallow. ""Then we found out he'd just left the hospital. ""If something had been done then, when this happened, none of the other women would have suffered. That's what hurts me the most."" She said more should have been done to stop him practising and he should have been struck off. ""I had massive internal bleeding and they had to open me up and repair everything,"" said Mrs Dallow, now 54, of Lichfield, Staffordshire. ""I was told that I did have my heart pumped by somebody with their hand, which was scary. If it hadn't been for the theatre staff next door who came in, I wouldn't be here."" Mrs Dallow was awarded Â£40,000 in damages in 2001, but said: ""It's knocked my confidence. I don't really have any friends. I don't go out. I had to stop work. I used to be a registered child minder at the time and had to stop that because I just couldn't cope."" Mrs Dallow underwent the procedure at Good Hope Hospital in Sutton Coldfield James Fernihough believed he was in the ""safest hands"" with Paterson James Fernihough had three lumpectomies in 12 months. He later learned the procedures were unnecessary. What made his experience even worse was that he had once worked with the surgeon. Mr Fernihough, 43, of Wall Heath, West Midlands, had taken a job as a trainee theatre practitioner at Little Aston Hospital in 1994. He later left and in 2003 found a lump on his left side, just below the nipple. His GP recommended he see a specialist, and, recognising Paterson 's name on a list of consultants, he made an appointment to see him at Spire Little Aston, where he was greeted like a friend. ""It was as though we hadn't lost any contact,"" said Mr Fernihough. ""He knew exactly who I was; he remembered. To me I was in the safest hands."" Paterson told him that the lump could be ""sinister"" and should be removed. Mr Fernihough said: ""Alarm bells rang because two to three months beforehand I told Ian Paterson that I had lost my father to heart disease and lung cancer. What's going through my mind is, 'get it out of me'."" Afterwards he was told it was a fatty build-up of tissue. He had two further procedures and was later told all three should not have been carried out and he should have been offered a biopsy. ""As you can imagine, my world did implode a little and I found it quite difficult to understand why he did what he did,"" said Mr Fernihough. ""He was using cancer as a way of making money. This isn't a ['playing God'] thing. He took a pound of flesh off me for money."" Surgeon 'psychopathic like Shipman' Surgeon 'played God' with women's bodies What is cleavage-sparing surgery?

"Marco Antonio dos Santos has spent his whole life working as an orange farmer Brazil is the world's biggest producer of both oranges and orange juice, but changing breakfast tastes, especially in Europe, mean the country's reliance on the fruit may have to change. Marco Antonio dos Santos says he was not born under an orange tree. But that's about the only event in his life not linked to oranges, he jokes. The 54-year-old is from the city of Taquaritinga, in the state of Sao Paulo. He has dedicated his entire life - as have several generations of his family before him - to making Brazil the world's largest producer of the citrus fruit. And it has paid off. One in every three oranges in the world is now grown in a relatively small area in the states of Sao Paulo and Minas Gerais. Half of all orange juice drunk worldwide is from Brazil too. The country's unquestionable global dominance would suggest that orange producers like Mr Santos have little to worry about, but recent numbers suggest otherwise. Three years ago Brazil produced 400 million boxes of oranges. In the latest harvest for 2016-17 that number had fallen to just 242 million boxes. ""About 15 years ago, I remember we had about 20,000 orange producers in our region. Now we are down to about 6,000,"" says Mr Santos. Brazil began exporting oranges in the 1960s and soon came to dominate the sector Much of the decrease can be linked to changes in breakfast tastes, particularly in Europe, putting the future of what was once the world's most dominant breakfast beverage in jeopardy. More stories from the BBC's global trade series looking at trade from an international perspective: Why a $1.6bn car plant has been left to decay 'You don't have to be a squillionaire to buy art' The slimming pills that put me in hospital How Scottish salmon conquered the world Read more global trade series here. Brazil started exporting oranges in the 1960s when Florida, previously the world's biggest orange producer, was hit by a citrus greening disease, which makes the fruit unpalatable and eventually kills the trees. By the 1980s,Brazilian orange producers,externalhad achieved a global dominance that remains to this day. Giant Brazilian juice firms Cutrale and Citrosuco built factories in the US and Portugal as well as modern terminals in major ports such as Ghent and Rotterdam. The scale and low costs achieved by these investments made it virtually impossible for new players to rival them. Brazilians drink far less orange juice than people in the US and Europe Yet increasinglyBrazil's dominance in the sector,externalis becoming a hindrance. One problem is that it puts too many oranges in only one basket: the external market. More than 95% of its production is shipped abroad, the majority of it in the form of orange juice. So when there are fluctuations in the exchange rate, the price of the commodity or changes in habits abroad, manufacturers have nowhere else to sell their product. ""This much concentration on external markets is unusual,"" says Ibiapaba Netto, who heads CitrusBR, the association that represents the big orange juice players. ""If you take the Brazilian meat industry, for example, they only export about 20% of their production. The other 80% is sold domestically. So they are never too exposed to problems abroad."" But turning towards their home market wouldn't solve the problem for orange producers either, because Brazilians just don't drink enough orange juice. In Brazil a typical individual drinks just 15 litres a year compared to the 22 litres of an average European or American. But the biggest threat to Brazilian orange producers is that orange juice has become less popular in Europe, especially in the UK. For most of the post-World War Two era, orange juice was the dominant breakfast beverage. But not anymore. ""Modern life has a new rhythm and many people are now skipping breakfast, or getting drinks on the go. The cereal industry is facing the same issue,"" says Mr Netto. Fruit juices are also losing their reputation as a healthy option, with some nutritionists claiming they can be as unhealthy as fizzy drinks. As a result consumers have flocked to new breakfast drinks, such as smoothies and vegetable-based ""detox"" juices. Smoothies and coconut water are beginning to rival the popularity of orange juice One winner in the ""juice battle"" is coconut water, which has less than half the calories of orange juice. Between 2012 and 2015 in the UK, orange juice consumption fell by 100 million litres, while consumption of coconut water rose by 80 million litres, according to CitrusBR. Despite changing trends, orange is still juice drinkers' preferred choice and has a 30% market share. A better harvest in Brazil and low international stocks could also see orange production rebound this season. According to the government, there will be a 50% increase in the number of boxes produced in the 2017-18 harvest. Brazilian growers are also fighting back. For each box of oranges they produce this season, farmers will pay six cents (of a Brazilian real) towards a UK and US marketing campaign promoting the virtues of their produce abroad. Unsurprisingly, they disagree that orange juice is unhealthy. But for many orange producers in Brazil it is too little too late. Brazilian orange growers are now backing a US and UK marketing campaign Many in Sao Paulo and Minas Gerais have already abandoned orange production, with some now planting lemons and guava for domestic markets instead. In 2015,Cutrale bought US banana company Chiquita,externalto try to diversify. But Mr Santos and other traditional orange growers are not willing to lose a fight their families have fought for generations. ""Things will never go back to being what they used to be like. We won't ever have that many mouths for our oranges anymore. But the market is reaching a new equilibrium.""

"This video can not be played BBC's Tajuden Soroush was a passenger in the car with Mohammed Nasir when bomb exploded BBC driver Mohammed Nazir was among scores of victims of Wednesday's bombing in Kabul's secure central zone. As Afghanistan  mourns those killed, the editor of the BBC's Afghan service Waheed Massoud, remembers a friend and colleague caught up in an all too familiar scenario. I woke to a phone call telling me that ""a BBC minibus"" had been caught up in the Kabul truck bomb attack. But we did not know for sure how bad it was, and how many of our colleagues were hurt. As things stand at least 90 were killed, but this toll will undoubtedly rise with hundreds injured. The immediate feeling was so familiar: a racing heart beat and a thousand simultaneous thoughts going through my head. My heart felt heavier. I felt it was sinking down to my feet. I desperately made phone calls any way I could - through Viber, WhatsApp, Facebook, and my mobile -  but to no avail. Kabul bomb: Afghan leader condemns 'cowardly' attack In pictures: Kabul explosion Afghanistan country profile The whole network was down, another indication that something horrendous had happened. I was torn between hope and fear. Fearing the loss of another dear one and hoping that all would be fine. It is devastating when fear wins over hope; I soon found out that one dear colleague, Mohammed Nazir, our driver, had been killed and four other colleagues wounded. Thetruck bomb exploded close to Kabul's ""Green Zone"", the most secure place in the heart of the city protected by guards, blast walls and security boom gates. It killed and wounded dozens of people. Injured Afghans run from the site of the blast I can imagine what Nazir's family, his wife and children, were going through as they were waiting for news from BBC colleagues who were searching hospitals and morgues to find him. As they prayed for good news, they too were battling fears and hopes. And they are not the only ones. The friends and family of the hundreds of victims of today's attack, like those of Mohammed Nazir, will have had the same experience. Mohammed Nazir was young. He was the father of three children and the only breadwinner in his family. He had a gentle smile and a warm personality. I knew Nazir for years and I worked with him most days of the week. BBC journalists, support staff and visitors remember him as an honest and reliable person. Most colleagues deploying from Kabul to dangerous provinces would prefer to go with Nazir. The irony is he survived decades of war, conflict and hostile environments but was killed by a bomb in the most secure diplomatic enclave in the heart of Kabul. Many BBC colleagues find it hard to believe that the smiling face that drove them to work this morning will be buried by the end of the same day. The thought that he is no longer with us is hanging over everyone. We think of his children, his wife and extended family and how they will survive without him in a country that does not have a welfare system. Afghanistan has no welfare system, adding to the agony for families who lose a breadwinner At least Nazir's family will receive financial support from the BBC. But what will happen to those of the others killed and wounded? The attack today not only took lives, and caused injury. It also in an instant changed the future for hundreds of families. Soon, the carnage of today will linger only as another casualty figure from yet another attack. Life will carry on. But what happened here in Kabul is simply a reflection of what Afghanistan has been experiencing over the past 38 years in various different forms and guises. Afghan security personnel were deployed to guard the bomb site in Kabul The early post-2001 years were a brief period of hope when many believed the country would finally be able to breathe a sigh of relief from constant chaos. But it did not last long. Today, Afghanistan is as much a battleground for proxy wars and regional arm wrestling as it was decades ago, with ordinary Afghans feeling like victims of an unchosen fate. Although Nato military boots on the ground are present to provide training and support to the Afghan security forces and the government, the situation has not improved. The insurgents enjoy similar covert support today from regional players. As Wednesday's devastating events proved, security, even in the most protected areas, is fragile. Vulnerabilities in the security forces, or the sophistication of the insurgent groups, or both, could be to blame . But for the public the situation represents one continuous, and lifelong, nightmare.

"Snapping turtles were among those caught up in the roadkill ""slaughter"" For anyone on a long drive on a country road, one of the bleakest sights is the amount of roadkill you see punctuating the passing miles. It shows the fatal incompatibility between our need to get to places quickly and wildlife trying to get across a road. In terms of the odds being stacked up against an animal, it's particularly bad news for the slow-moving turtle. They're not exactly going to sprint away from danger. But research published by academics at McMaster University in Ontario, Canada, reports on the major success of a scheme to reduce roadkill. The findings are claimed to provide lessons for the global problem of animal deaths on roads. The project focused on a road claimed to have one of the worst roadkill rates in the world. Long Point Causeway, a road beside Lake Erie in Ontario, runs through a nature reserve - a Unesco ""biosphere reserve"" - which is home to a number of endangered species of turtles. Until the protection project, the road beside Lake Erie was a notorious hotspot for roadkill But this mix of slow animals and fast traffic has meant a terrible rate of attrition. On a stretch of road less than three miles long, 10,000 animals, from 100 different species were being crushed each year, including many rare turtles. Turtles are relatively slow to reproduce - some species can be 20 years old before they lay their first eggs. It means that generations are replaced only slowly and the survival of turtle populations can be threatened by such loss of life from passing traffic. Global education University of Birmingham to open campus in Dubai Apple expands its European academy to tackle digital skills gap 'Mesearch': An innovative form of research or academic narcissism? Battle over Hungarian university becomes symbolic struggle Get in touch with Sean Coughlan (sean.coughlan@bbc.co.uk) with any ideas The study, Mitigating Reptile Road Mortality, examined the Â£1.6m, Long Point Causeway Improvement Project, that tested different ways to stop turtles and snakes becoming roadkill. Could drivers be persuaded to behave differently? Researchers found that permanent road warning signs made little difference - as drivers soon stopped paying any attention. More effective has been the use of a temporary electronic message board, put on display only during the peak summer months for animal road deaths. ""It's quite common now for people to stop and help a turtle across the road rather than run over it,"" said project co-ordinator, Rick Levick. But a separate study, using dummy rubber turtles and snakes, had also shown that some drivers deliberately tried to hit the animals. Slow-moving turtles were being hit on a stretch of road claiming 10,000 roadkill deaths per year So rather than urging drivers to be more careful, the big challenge has been stopping turtles getting on to the road in the first place. Culverts were dug below the surface to allow turtles and snakes to cross safely, and fences and barriers were constructed along the road to force them to use these underpasses. This was not straightforward. In some parts of the road it was sometimes difficult to put in adequate fencing, such as where the land was very marshy. And the study found that partial fencing could be worse than being completely unfenced, with animals in large numbers going through the gaps. Once the stretch of road had been completely sealed off with purpose-designed, plasticised fencing, turtles and snakes then had to be persuaded to go down these culverts. Regular concrete was too cold, so a specially adapted type of warmer polymer material was used, with a design allowing in enough light to make the animals confident that there really was light at the end of the tunnel. They also had to be no more than 150m apart, because any more would be beyond the roaming range of the lumbering turtles. Radio-tagged turtles were followed to find the best combinations of materials and locations. Deer are among the most common roadkill victims in the US and UK The last of the turtle crossings were installed earlier this year - and the study is claiming a major improvement. ""The average number of turtles venturing on to the road has dropped by 89% and snake numbers are down 28%,"" said Chantel Markle, a biologist at McMaster University. ""At many stages during the project, we have found ourselves at the leading edge of both the science and technology in this field,"" said Mr Levick. The findings echoed another international roadkill research study published last year, which showed that crossings under roads made little difference, unless there was secure fencing. Another point raised by researchers is the lack of accurate data about what are claimed as ""hundreds of millions"" of roadkill deaths each year. Populations of turtles can be threatened by high levels of road deaths There are a number of attempts to gather more evidence. The California Roadkill Observation System asks volunteers to report animal deaths - with deer, raccoon and skunk the most common fatalities. Project Splatter, based at the University of Cardiff, is gathering evidence in the UK. Also in the UK, a Freedom of Information request last month found that deer, badgers and foxes were the most typical animals found beside motorways and major main roads. Highways England had removed the bodies of more than 600 deer from these major roads in 2016-17. But the AA has published much higher figures for the overall road network, saying 42,000 deer were killed by traffic. In Canada, on the road beside Lake Erie, Mr Levick said they had decided something had to change. ""We all agreed that it was time to put an end to the slaughter.""

"The Trump Organization made only one change: replacing the word ""Integrity"" with the word ""Trump"" It may not be the most dramatic scandal facing Donald Trump this week, but the US president has been accused of branding his US commercial properties with a stolen coat of arms. Mr Trump's heraldic arms is a near-identical copy of one registered in 1939 by Joseph Edward Davies,the New York Times reported,external. The copy, printed on everything from golf carts to socks, made a single small change: where the original said ""Integritas"", now it says ""Trump"". Davies was an American diplomat and husband to Marjorie Merriweather Post, who built the Mar-a-Lago resort that now belongs to the president, and where presumably he first saw the coat of arms. The similarity was spotted by Davies' grandson, former US senator Joseph Tydings, on a visit to the resort. He told the Times he had not given permission to the Trump Organization to use the arms. It drew the attention of heraldic officials in Scotland when Mr Trump attempted to brand a new golf course in Aberdeen with the adulterated arms. They noticed that he hadn't registered it with the Court of the Lord Lyon, which approves all applications for arms and has authority to litigate against anyone using a design improperly. An application to trademark the Trump copy with the College of Arms, the authority for England, Wales and Northern Ireland, was rejected after the college noted that the design had been lifted from an existing coat of arms. The motto, changed by the Trump organisation, does not technically form part of the design, making the two identical in the eyes of the authorities. ""We would never allow this as a new coat of arms,"" said John Petrie, Rouge Croix Pursuivant of Arms at the college. ""There needs to be at least two lineal differences from something that's been granted in the past."" The fact that Mr Trump had changed the colours of the crest to black and gold was not considered sufficient, Mr Petrie said. Trump has made liberal use of the borrowed crest at his US resorts Coats of arms date to the 12th Century, where they were first worn on battle shields. They were adopted by members of the royal family and spread among the wider nobility, granted by the monarch to a male member of the family and passed down the male line. Nowadays, if you consider yourself to be part of an eminent family or institution, you can make your case to the College of Arms. Your status, and any design ideas you submit, will be reviewed and if approved, you will be granted a letters patent by the most senior herald, the Kings of Arms. Design remains a matter of taste, however. Modern day symbols of wealth ""would not be appropriate"", said Mr Petrie. ""A design for a coat of arms needs to be suitable, tasteful, and timeless,"" he said. ""Modern day apparel and equipment may not look very good in 50 or 100 years."" There has been some modernisation in design over the years, Mr Petrie said. ""We can include a little more than would have been allowed in the past, including national flowers, some national symbols or different animals that might not have been known before."" An adapted Trump crest on display at his Turnberry golf resort in Scotland It is illegal in the UK to assume another family's coat of arms, but someone doing so in England, Wales or Northern Ireland is unlikely to feel the long arm of the law. London's High Court of Chivalry - the special court dedicated to the task - last sat in 1954. But in Scotland, where Mr Trump used the borrowed design on promotional materials for his golf course, he could still have faced legal action. Mr Tydings told the Times he had talked his family out of taking legal action. ""I just told the other members of my family that you can't win on this,"" he said. ""You'll borrow for two generations to sue him."" In the end, after a challenge by the Court of the Lord Lyon, the Trump Organisation altered the design it had taken from Mr Davies and was granted its own Scottish patent. Here's how a Trump spokeswomandescribed,externalthe new coat of arms: ""Three chevronels are used to denote the sky, sand dunes and sea - the essential components of the [golf resort] site - and the double-sided eagle represents the dual nature and nationality of Trump's heritage."" She added: ""The eagle clutches golf balls, making reference to the great game of golf, and the motto 'Numquam Concedere' is Latin for 'Never Give Up' - Trump's philosophy."" But in the US, where the heraldic laws are less stringent, Mr Trump simply trademarked the Davies family design and plastered it across golf resorts, hotels and assorted merchandise. In Britain it would not be the done thing, said Mr Petrie. ""It's certainly not proper to use the arms of another family,"" he said. ""In this country it is always considered preferable to petition for your own.""

"This video can not be played Dua Lipa dishes the dirt Last time we spoke to Dua Lipa, we called her ""a pop star in waiting"". But we didn't expect the wait would be so long. The pop star had the misfortune of launching her career just as streaming tightened its grip on the charts. Soon, it became obvious that people would rather listen to Ed Sheeran's Galway Girl 245 million times (fact!) than type a new artist's name into the search bar. So Dua saw early singles likeLast Dance,externalandBlow Your Mind (Mwah),externalstall outside the top 20; while her debut album, originally due last September, was delayed three times. The tide finally turned in February, when the 21-year-old scored no less than three singles in the top 15 - two of which were features (withSean Paul,externalandMartin Garrix,external), while her own track,Be The One,external, climbed inside the top 10. In the same week, she won best new artist at the NME Awards. The star says delays to her debut album ""gave me the opportunity to show people there's more to my music"" During her long, slow rise, Dua kept writing, shuffling tracks on and off her album ""so it still feels really fresh,"" she says. Among the last minute additions were duets with R&B star Miguel and Coldplay's Chris Martin - with the end result that Dua's debut has all the confidence and authority of most artists' second or third album. And, with six hit singles spread across the 17-track deluxe edition, the quality rarely dips. ""I've been counting down the days 'til it comes out,"" she says. ""It comes in waves where I get really nervous then I'm really excited. And then nervous and then excited and thenreallyexcited. ""Basically, I'm excited."" With the release just days away, Dua talks about the relationships that inspired the record; hooking up with Chris Martin; and why Katy Perrymightbe a robot. It's been interesting to watch this album come together over the last nine months. Pop artists don't usually get to road-test their music, but you've played these songs all over Europe. Did that influence the tracklisting? Yeah, it was actually just research for me. I'd get to see how fans would react to new songs and it was really fun. On the flipside, I've seen fans complain their favourite songs aren't on the album. That's the downside. Some of those tracks got really, really good live and the fans loved them, but I never really got round to finishing them off because I was always writing new songs and expressing where I was in different points in my life There are two songs, calledRunning,externalandWant To,external, which fans are really upset about, so I'm eventually going to release a live version of those songs - because that's the best version they're in. Homesick, Dua's duet with Chris Martin, is the closing track on her debut album How did you end up working with Chris Martin? I was in a meeting and someone asked, ""Who would you love to work with?"" and I said, ""I'd love to write a song with Chris Martin."" One of the ladies in the room said, ""Oh, I've been working with him for a while - I'll happily send him some of your music.""  So I picked a few songs but I didn't really know what to expect. It was a leap of faith. Then I got an email saying, ""Chris would love to meet you. Why don't you come to his studio in Malibu?"" I was really nervous and really excited at the same time. I didn't know how to act. Did he shake your hand, or go straight in for a hug? I think it was a shaking hands sort of introduction. But I felt really, really at ease and really calm. We sat down and had a chat, and I started playing him tracks from the album. He would really listen really attentively, and write down the title of every song. Eventually he said, ""Great, why don't we try and get another song for your album?"" And then and there, he just got up on the piano, and we set up some mics and started making up melodies. It came together really organically and quickly. I think it's a really beautiful song I like the way his vocals are subtly woven around yours. A lot of people would have been tempted to give him a solo verse and put ""FEATURING CHRIS MARTIN"" on the album cover. Yeah, it's like we sing together. I'm just really, really proud of it. I feel very lucky to have an artist that I really admire on my first album. ""Buy my album, or the rabbit gets it"" Why do you thinkco-writing has become so prevalentin pop music? When I started writing, I had lots of ideas and I knew how to get my thoughts out [but] I didn't know how to build a proper song. Having someone help me make sense of that was how it all started. And now I've made such good friends with the people I work with, I just go back and tell them about my life and we're like, ""Okay, let's start writing!"" And then a million people hear it in a song! A lot of the album is about heartbreak. Does sadness inspire you more than happiness? I find sadness way more inspiring. It's the stuff that lingers the longest. I guess that's where I'm at in my life. Relationships are tough but without a little bit of heartbreak, I don't think I'd be able to write good songs. IDGAF describes a boyfriend who was caught cheating on you. Is that a true story? Yes and no. Bits of it are very true. It's about this person that, a long time after you've broken up, comes back to say ""hi"" and you think to yourself, ""What gives him the right to call me now and see how I'm doing? Does he not realise the damage he's done?"" Dua has already played a sold-out headline tour of the UK and takes to the road again this autumn What inspired the song New Rules? It's about keeping your distance from someone who's bad for you. I'm setting some rules down so [that I] won't go back to that person. Can you clarify the rules? One: Don't pick up the phone, you know he's only calling 'cause he's drunk and alone. Two: Don't let him in, you'll have to kick him out again. Three: Don't be his friend, you're only going to wake up in his bed in the morning. And if you're under him, you ain't over him! Amazing. If this whole pop thing fails, you've got a second career as an agony aunt. Do you know what? It's good advice for a teen magazine. Judging by yourInstagram,external, you're seeing a great reaction in Europe. It's been amazing. I feel like the shows keep topping one another. The star played a massive homecoming show to 15,000 fans in Pristina, Kosovo last summer Have you ever had a stage invasion? I've created monsters! When I play Blow Your Mind, I get all the fans to come up on stage with me. We've created this routine where we shake our bums, and then we turn back to the crowd and go ""mwah!"" At my very last show in 2016, in Holland, I wasn't ready to invite anyone up - but the second the song started, all of them jumped on. I was swarmed by a million fans. They nearly floored me! Is it true that you once crashed another pop star's show? I invaded Katy Perry's stage at the Hammersmith Apollo, when she was doing the Teenage Dream tour! She was singing I Wanna Dance With Somebody and she was like, ""OK, who wants to get on stage with me?' and I made sure I got up. I climbed over everyone, over the barrier, up on the stage and dived around. She was wearing this beautiful rhinestone bodysuit which was absolutely amazing. So I went up to touch it and it was rock solid. Are you telling me Katy Perry is a robot? She might be a robot. Yeah, maybe. You're not denying it! That's the closest I've ever come to her so, sure, why not? Dua Lipa's self-titled debut album is released on Friday, 2 June by Warner Bros.

"The Lions' squad will play 10 games in New Zealand on this tour The British and Irish Lions are not only one of the biggest sporting names in rugby union, they are also arguably its premier commercial brand. This weekend Warren Gatland's squad kick off their tour of New Zealand, home of the World Cup holders. It will be their first visit since 2005, in what should be a mouth-watering series of clashes. Each Lions tour generates millions of pounds in turnover, with revenues pouring in from major sponsorship deals, tourism and other events such as high-profile gala dinners.  It is estimated that the Lions turn over about $50m (Â£39m) in each four-year cycle between tours. Meanwhile, some 35,000 fans are expected to make the journey from around the world, with close to half buying packages from the in-house travel operator, Lions Rugby Travel. This commercial power of the tour, which takes in 10 games - including three Test matches against the All Blacks - means it will generate significant revenues for the development of the sport in the UK and Ireland. ""The value of the Lions is actually so much greater than what you might see on a tour. It is the fusion of the professional and amateur eras, it embodies all the good qualities of the game,"" Charlie McEwen, British and Irish Lions chief operating officer, tells me. ""And that means that supporting and growing the presence of rugby union is a very important part of what we do.  The Lions is a subsidiary of the four home rugby unions and any profits are distributed back to the home unions, with the ultimate aim of growing the game."" Charlie McEwen says the Lions combine the commercial with the sporting, for the good of the game As part of that mission, at the end of March the Lions also unveiled its own separate grassroots programme. It will see some of the money they raise go directly into a standalone Lions-directed programme. ""With the support of the home unions we will be running programmes for existing youth players to keep them in the game,"" says Mr McEwen. ""It will be using the inspiration of the Lions brand to keep them playing at an age - late teens and early twenties - where there is a high drop-off rate."" The Lions' financial machine that generates those funds for developing the game is largely sponsor-driven. In total there are 11 major commercial backers - from shirt sponsors Standard Life to brewery Doom Bar, the official beer of the Lions. Some three-quarters of the Lions income is from sponsorship, a much bigger proportion than that enjoyed by England's RFU or any of the other home unions. ""We hold sponsors and partners very dear,"" says Mr McEwen. ""We look to find brands that reflect our values and everything we stand for. Standard Life is one of a number of big name sponsors of the Lions' tour ""We try to ensure we deliver against what they need, but also to make sure they don't compromise our values, or ability to perform on the field. If we are not competitive on the field then the whole concept of the Lions is brought into question."" As well as Standard Life, which replaced HSBC as shirt sponsors, other big name backers include Land Rover, Qantas, Gillette, EY, and Canterbury. In a changing sporting and leisure landscape, he insists that the Lions are not an anachronism but are as relevant now as they were when they first set out across the globe in the late 19th Century. In 2014 the Lions itself underwent an internal ""strategic brand review"", conducted with players from the 1950s to the present day, and also including coaches, broadcasters, commercial partners and consumer experts. Mr McEwen said that it was realised that if the players did not still have the desire to be selected for the Lions ahead of their sporting peers, then the brand was no longer relevant. He said that after a thorough analysis that drive among players to be selected was still there. Sam Warburton will captain the Lions for a second successive tour And he says that from a rugby follower's perspective, the Lions are also still hugely important. ""We are far and away the second most desirable proposition in rugby for fans, after attending a World Cup match,"" says Mr McEwen. ""We have a big fan base, who hold us dear, and that extends to people in New Zealand, Australia and South Africa. Everyone wants the Lions to stick around."" This year's Lions tour will be the last to feature 10 games, with future tours reduced to eight matches, in what is an increasingly crowded rugby union international calendar. Meanwhile, for this year's host nation, it is hoped the visit of the star-studded Lions squad will provide such a buzz of excitement it will help New Zealand Rugby (NZR) towards balancing its books, after reporting a loss of NZ$7.5m (Â£4m) for 2016. A Lions tour is a financial bonanza for the host country. NZR had matchday revenues of NZ$9.2m in 2004, and NZ$11.2m in 2006, but in the Lions tour year of 2005 revenues were NZ$33.9m. The Lions have not won a series in New Zealand since 1971 NZR has not specified how much the tour will generate, but expects demand to exceed that of the Lions' last visit in 2005, when travelling fans contributed tens of millions towards the wider New Zealand economy. ""We only tour New Zealand every 12 years, and that breeds value,"" says Mr McEwen. ""Lions tours are right up there as a live sporting proposition. People get excited about the rugby and football world cups, and this is also something that people want to be part of - whether in the stadium or on TV - at the top echelon of sport. ""The great thing about the Lions is the great amount of interest in them. ""The ultimate purpose for the team is winning - but our focus as a business is growing the game.""

"Arsene Wenger won a record seventh FA Cup on Saturday but has faced pressure from Arsenal fans this season Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger is targeting next season's Premier League title after signing a new two-year deal at the club. The agreement does not include a break clause and, should it be completed, will extend his reign to 23 years. Neither Arsenal nor Wenger, 67, see this as definitely being his final contract. ""I love this club and I am looking forward to the future with optimism and excitement,"" said Wenger. Sell 'overindulged' Sanchez and Ozil - Keown 21 years, 162 players, Â£700m spent, 16 trophies - and counting Listen to the latest Football Daily podcast Arsenal are expected to spend at least Â£100m on new players in the upcoming transfer window - which opens on 1 July - having also spent around that figure last summer. ""This is a strong group of players and with some additions we can be even more successful,"" Wenger told the club website. ""We're committed to mounting a sustained league challenge and that will be our focus this summer and next season."" This video can not be played Arsene Wenger: Arsenal boss calls for togetherness from the fans The Gunners finished fifth in the Premier League this season, the first time they have finished outside the top four since the Frenchman joined in 1996. They finished 18 points behind champions Chelsea, butbeat the Blues 2-1to win the FA Cup at Wembley on Saturday. Wenger met club owner Stan Kroenke on Monday to determine his future, with the decision relayed to directors at a Tuesday board meeting. Following Wednesday's official announcement, chief executive Ivan Gazidis said: ""There is no complacency anywhere at this club. ""Our goal is to compete for and win trophies here and in Europe. Everything we do is designed to make that happen and we will be working hard on and off the pitch this summer to improve and make a strong challenge next season."" American majority owner Kroenke said the Gunners' ambition was to win the Premier League and ""other major trophies in Europe"" under Frenchman Wenger. ""It's what the fans, players, staff, manager and board expect and we won't rest until that is achieved - Arsene is the best person to help us make that happen,"" he added. Uzbek-born Russian billionaire Alisher Usmanov, who madea Â£1bn bid to wrest controlof the club from Kroenke earlier this month, said he was ""pleased"" Wenger was staying ""as he is one of the very best coaches in Europe"". However, Usmanov added it was ""of paramount importance that he receives the full support of the board and majority shareholder"". The metals magnate owns 30% of Arsenal's shares but is not on the board and plays no part in the decision-making at the club. ""If the support is not forthcoming, we stand ready to step in and do everything we can to deliver success on and off the field,"" he added. Arsene staying is 'good news' - Lauren Arsenal a 'long way behind' - Lineker Can Arsene write a new chapter in Arsenal's history? Although Arsenal may have Â£100m to spend, the issue is that they already have a high wage bill and their revenues are not as large as Europe's very biggest clubs. And that's before you factor in dropping down from the Champions League to the Europa League. They need to be careful when it comes to Financial Fair Play, meaning they will inevitably have to sell some players to free up funds for wages rather than transfer fees. It will be a busy few months at the Emirates. Decision to stay:""I identify myself so much with the club. When you can be where you love to be, that's easy. It's difficult because you want to respond to the demands of all the people who love this club."" The fans:""Let's be together to support our players, to support the club and all give our absolute best to be at the level that we want to be. We can move up to the next level, I'm convinced of that, by having faith in the way we want to play football and by supporting the players we have already."" Kroenke:""Our ambitions are unlimited. We live in a very competitive world where you need the support of the owner. He's highly ambitious and supportive as well so, on that front, we are all united with exactly the same targets."" New signings:""We have a very heavy squad at the moment so maybe we might lose some players. We will work very hard to find the additions of top, top quality. I believe that our squad is very strong and we will only look for top-class people who can strengthen our team now."" This video can not be played Lack of respect towards me a disgrace - Wenger Wenger led the Gunners to three Premier League titles and four FA Cups in his first nine seasons in charge. In 2003-04, he became the first manager since 1888-89 to lead a team through an entire top-flight season unbeaten. But after winning the 2005 FA Cup, they had to wait another nine years - or 3,283 days - for their next silverware. It came as they beat Hull City to win the 2014 FA Cup, before winning the trophy again the following year. Arsenal are have not won the Premier League in 13 years and in 11 of those seasons have finished 10 or more points adrift of the champions. BBC Sport chief football writer Phil McNulty Arsenal have not qualified for the Champions League for the first time in 20 years - and many would believe an FA Cup triumph would be the perfect parting point, allowing Wenger to go out on a high and a successor to usher in the new era. Wenger does not think in those terms. He is the eternal optimist who has never felt Arsenal were far away from recreating a title-winning team, even though the evidence against has piled up before him. A section of Arsenal's support have organised protest marches and made their discontent clear as Wenger's side once again failed to halt a barren title sequence stretching back to ""The Invincibles"" season of 2003/04 - with the manager describing some of his treatment as ""a disgrace"". However, he is committed as ever, even after 1,175 games as Arsenal manager, 676 wins and a remarkable win percentage of 57.5% - but did Saturday start a new era of success that can emulate his early glories, or will he simply face the same criticism again at the first sign of trouble next season? This video can not be played 'Arsene Who?' - Wenger remembers joining Arsenal Match of the Day presenter and former England striker Gary Lineker:""Arsenal have got a long way to go at the moment. If you ask me now whether they are going to be in the top four next season, I would say most probably not. They are further behind than Wenger thinks. ""The only other example of a manager that decides when and where he goes is Sir Alex Ferguson, but he was still winning league titles. ""Arsene Wenger was still winning FA Cups and until this season he had always got in the top four, but now that's changed."" Former Arsenal goalkeeper Bob Wilson:""Without the Champions League, the only way is if you can compete salary-wise to attract the players. ""Chelsea bought the best player available last season in N'Golo Kante and Arsenal went for him too but came nowhere near the salary that Chelsea pay. ""Arsenal cannot compete with Manchester United, or Chelsea with all the money Roman Abramovich has, or Sheikh Mansour has at Manchester City - these are clubs who can manage to go into huge debt."" This video can not be played Arsenal have nucleus of really great squad - Wilson Arsenal Supporters' Trust spokesperson Tim Payton:""The reaction is very mixed - we recently surveyed our membership and 78% thought it was time for a change. ""We all want to see Arsenal win and we will get behind the team, but they need to get on top of this summer. They've got the contracts of star players Mesut Ozil and Alexis Sanchez ending and they've not got a good track record of being decisive and quick in the transfer market. ""No one should be abused but every supporter has a right to a voice and it is concerning to see Wenger challenging his own fans and if I look across the football world it's never ended well when a manger falls out with his supporters."" Arsenal Fan TV founder and presenter Robbie Lyle:""Now the announcement has been made, fans might start to get behind Wenger. ""It's all going to depend on what kind of summer Arsenal can have and whether they can bring in some transfers that excite the fans.

" “Kilnasaggart Bridge” was a whispered curse on the lips of train travellers in the days of Northern Ireland’s Troubles. It nudges up close to the border that separates the six counties of Ulster in the United Kingdom from the Republic of Ireland. The bridge was such a popular target for IRA bombers that uninterrupted travel from north to south was often impossible. A groan would go up as the tinny tannoy announced that, because of problems on the line, all passengers would disembark at the Newry halt, travel by bus across the border and then clamber back on the train at Dundalk in the Republic of Ireland. We trundled on, we trundled off. It added at least an hour and more like two to the journey. So much for the “express”. But at least we knew we had crossed the border. Now, commuters sip posh coffee and sail past this once troubled spot, blissfully unaware of where the north ends, and where the Republic of Ireland begins. The border is there, but it is not there and the bombs are history. Drive along the modern motorway that links Belfast to Dublin and the only clue that you have crossed is the subtle switch from signposts in miles to those in kilometres. Keen-eyed, you might spot the change in the markings on the sides of the road. It is a child’s guessing game - north or south, are we there, aren’t we here? About 50 years ago, it was easier. The good roads were in Northern Ireland - you knew you had hit the Republic when the potholes rattled the car. The road signs in the south were more dramatic than the north. They came in sets and block capitals: SLOW; SLOWER; SLOWER STILL. The Killeen border checkpoint near Newry, 1987 This border is 310 miles (499km) long and meanders from Carlingford Lough in the east to Lough Foyle in the west. It was never a neat line. It is a squiggle across the map of Ireland – like an awkward child taking their crayon for a walk. That line divides rivers, slices fields, cuts bridges in two and even, occasionally, divides the odd house. Carlingford Lough marks the easternmost point of the border There are homes where you can have your breakfast in the north and go to sleep in the south. There are places where mobile phone reception in just one house fluctuates between north and south. The days of the Troubles are behind us - days lived in the dark shadow of watchtowers and turrets are vanished. But now the UK is getting ready to leave the EU, and the people of the borderlands are uneasy. Up to 35,000 people commute across the border every day. Hospital patients and schoolchildren and cross-border workers are among those who have to make the daily journey. None of them wants a hard border, but the EU has stressed that there will have to be some form of customs control. What is a “soft” border? Will thousands of people find themselves cursing daily in long queues at border points? The village of Muff lies close to the border between Donegal and County Londonderry. During the Troubles, cars queued at the Army checkpoint, where twitchy young soldiers with rifles rattled out the usual questions. Where are you coming from? Where are you going to? Get out and open your boot, sir. Then it was on down a twist in the road and the Irish customs men were on their marks waiting to catch the locals with the contraband. Now, you’d hardly know you were crossing. A black corrugated hut at the old customs post is boarded up - weeds sprout from the chimney. Over the bridge and you’re into the one-street village. It is tiny but boasts four petrol stations. The Derry-Donegal crossing point at Muff There is what used to be an old Irish ballroom - a big, squat building called Borderland. When Derry city burned in riots and bombings, Borderland was the escape – the dance hall down the road, where you jived your way into another world. Marie Lindsay was born in Muff, but the city of Derry is centre stage in her heart. She lives in the hills just outside the village and has a foot in both camps. Each morning she gets into her car in Donegal, in the Republic, and drives up through a little wood. Then it’s on through a housing estate and into Derry, where she’s principal of a girls' school, St Mary’s College. Marie Lindsay, principal of St Mary's College, Derry She has lived her life along this border. Like thousands of others, she feels she has a double identity. Marie Lindsay in the art room at St Mary's College “I’m Donegal, born and bred. Donegal is in my DNA, but Derry is my home city, I feel I belong there,” she says. Her journey to work is seamless these days – down what was once an “unapproved” road - spiked, so that people could not drive across. As the Troubles in Northern Ireland escalated in the 1970s, the Army and police blocked and cratered the smaller roads to make all but the approved checkpoint routes impassable, and to stop paramilitaries crossing. Lindsay has known a hard border - the interminable waits at checkpoints. They were dark days that no-one really wants to recall. She has now grown used to peace and the ease of life. The spot marking the border is often nearly invisible On the evening drive home from work, she points out the spot where you have crossed. “The road signs switch from miles to kilometres, the road markings change, but that’s it,” she says. She carries two purses – a sterling purse for the north and a euro purse for the south. But both sides take each other’s currency at a decent rate. Many people carry two mobile phones – one north, one south. Talk to any of the girls in St Mary’s, says Lindsay, and you’ll soon find they have roots in Donegal – a granny in Malin, an aunty from Carndonagh. All down the years, city dwellers have taken a Sunday drive from Northern Ireland over the border to feast their eyes on the beauty of Five Fingers Strand, to nurse a pint in Buncrana, to treat the children to a ride on the swing boats by the shore. But the links amount to much more than a Sunday stroll. There are good schools in the city of Derry and the health service is free. Many people in Donegal send their children to school north of the border or are treated by the National Health Service -  some officially, some unofficially. There are pressing questions about students. Many from Northern Ireland travel to university in Dublin, Galway and Cork. Others from the Republic of Ireland cross the border to go to Queen’s in Belfast and to Derry’s Magee College and the North West Regional College. Magee College campus, Derry Lindsay is also concerned for the Donegal students who cross the border to go to the city’s further education college. “They could end up having to make the 40-minute drive to Letterkenny whereas before it was just 10 to 15 minutes into college in Derry.” On 23 June, 76p bought you one euro, but by the second week after the Brexit vote, that figure had shot up to 86p. It would reach a high of 90p last October, before falling back slightly since. For all those living in Donegal and working in Derry, the value of their sterling pay packets has plunged. In recent years, Lindsay’s Donegal village has played host to young families from Northern Ireland, lured by affordable housing. It has been a breath of fresh air – new life for the local primary school, tills ringing in the shops, a bustling community in the border village. But Brexit is making border folk start to think twice. Betty Holmes, Donegal Action for Cancer Care Betty Holmes is a member of Donegal Action for Cancer Care. The group is based in the Republic of Ireland but campaigns to access nearby health facilities in Northern Ireland. She is passionate about getting the best cancer care close at hand. It’s a deeply personal campaign. Her father died of lung cancer a week after her seventh birthday - he had never smoked. Her mother died from breast cancer three years later. When a new state-of-the-art radiotherapy centre opened recently in Altnagelvin Hospital, Derry, there was a sigh of relief from families on both sides of the border. No more two-hour treks over the mountain pass from Derry to Belfast for those living with cancer in Northern Ireland’s western region. No more five-hour treks from Donegal to Galway for cancer patients living in the Republic of Ireland. “It is a good 308km to Galway and what sort of a journey is that when there is radiotherapy sitting a few miles across the border?” asks Holmes. The journey to Altnagelvin Hospital is as little as 45 minutes from the top end of Donegal at Malin Head, she says. The Irish government has invested in the new services in Northern Ireland. The Prince of Wales opened Altnagelvin's new cancer centre earlier this month Agreements in place between the UK and Irish governments mean there are currently places for 385 cancer patients coming across the border. But Brexit weighs heavily on Betty Holmes’s mind. “Our concern is what happens in three to five years when the real effect of Brexit is starting to be felt,” she says. If you are the parent of one of the children from Northern Ireland who would travel to Dublin for paediatric cardiac care, then you might be asking what impact Brexit could have for those children?” “Will the Irish government be in a position to pay what [is set] down as the cost of treating a cancer patient at Altnagelvin? Will that number be reduced from 385 to 200 initially and will it go down from there?” The sharing of medical services across the border is not a one-way street. “If you are the parent of one of the children from Northern Ireland who would travel to Dublin for paediatric cardiac care, then you might be asking what impact Brexit could have for those children?” Ciaran Crilly woke up to the news of Brexit last June  and immediately worried about his business. Just up from Cloughoge church on the Newry border, where the Army posts once cast long shadows on the high hill, is the sweet factory – a family business set up in the 1970s. Ten years before that Ciaran Crilly’s father, Peter, left for a sugary fact-finding mission, taking in the Mars factory in Slough, and then Blackpool to uncover the secret of getting the name through the stick of rock. In the 1970s, as the Troubles raged in Northern Ireland, he came home, put his head down and set up a business. Now his son has the reins. Before Spanish holidays were the norm, the Crillys made seaside rock, selling it from Portrush in Northern Ireland to Bundoran and Bray in the Republic. This was the time when traditional sweets - bags of clove rock, bull’s eyes and brandy balls - still cast their spell. On both sides of the border, they still love their sweets. But Brexit was a blow. “It was terrible. Our business has been going superbly this last 10 years, year-on-year growth, no issues. Then you have this shock and you ask why did it need to happen?” Ciaran Crilly, Crillys Sweets The company was doing 75% of its business with the Republic of Ireland. When the UK exits Europe, if a trade deal isn’t reached, it could potentially face a 30% tariff in line with World Trade Organisation rules. That would be a worst-case scenario, says Crilly, but possible. For a while, Crilly considered upping sticks and moving a few miles down the road to set up in the Republic. Instead, they decided to stay put and look at new markets. In January, Crilly’s Sweets had a stand at a trade show in Germany and picked up business in Australia and China. They have been inundated with requests. Every emigrant craves the comforting taste of home. “We gained a lot of business through expats in Australia. People miss the kola cubes, pear drops, clove rock, mixed balls and even the jelly babies and wine gums,” he says. And, given the response from across the globe, perhaps Brexit could prove a blessing. But it’s an anxious time. “Half of our staff are from EU countries, such as Latvia and Poland. Will they stay?” Crilly doesn’t know. Drive on for an hour along the border and it’s sheep day at Enniskillen mart. The yard is a long line of muddy Land Rovers hauling trailers full of sheep and ewes. Men in flat caps, jeans and wellington boots meander about. Denzil Brady is 84 but wiry and keen-eyed. In all his years working on his father's farm in the hills around Enniskillen, he has had little time for the European Union. Denzil Brady “They're the greatest set of rogues in Brussels,” he says. “They have farms nearly out of business with the whole pile of paperwork. “With all those regulations, I fear for the young farmers in their 40s and how they'll suffer lives of misery.” Hugh Maguire has a different view. He has farmed for more than 50 years up by the famous Marble Arch Caves. His land straddles the border and he's had his share of headaches. He has cows and sheep, but some of them belong to the north and some belong to the Republic. It makes for two sets of paperwork and a few headaches. Woe betide the Irish sheep that sets a hoof over the border and vice versa. But Maguire believes the EU did a lot of good and Brexit is not welcome. He remembers the old days of smuggling across the border. He remembers the hard border, the checkpoints and queues and he just asks himself what lies ahead now. It could be a big step backwards, he says. “Farmers cannot farm without the European single farm payment,” he says. This is the agricultural subsidy payment, based on the area of a farmer's land, to offset the cost of producing food. James Johnston is the mart director - it's a family business that goes back to his grandfather's day. He's a young man and he admits that, personally, he is no fan of Europe. At its heart, [the EU]'s quite an undemocratic system. So I can understand reasons for pulling out.” “The EC originally was very good in terms of promoting free trade and promoting peace and security within Europe. “But I do think it has overstepped the mark as it has grown. Legislation-wise, it has just mushroomed. At its heart, it's quite an undemocratic system. So I can understand reasons for pulling out,”  he says. “However, where we are, here in this part of Ireland, in Fermanagh, we border with four of the southern counties, an open border is absolutely critical to peace and general well-being on both sides - free movement of people and goods.” Johnston argues that it must be maintained, however Brexit pans out. He'd like a more open border with the Republic of Ireland even than exists now. “It's exceptionally difficult, virtually impossible to bring livestock across the border, sell them in this mart and for traders to buy them and bring them home again. “It's easier for us to send cattle from the mart here to England and Scotland after a sale than to send them 10 or 12 miles down the road a stone's throw away across the southern border.” The problem lies with animal health and biosecurity, he says. Different policies exist on each side of the border. And now there will be more change. For farmers, the best-case scenario would be a post-Brexit free trade agreement, says Phelim O'Neill, a markets specialist for the Irish Farmers Journal. The worst-case scenario would see a very heavy tariff on agriculture products traded between the UK and the EU. “In terms of where will hit hard for Northern Ireland, somewhere between a quarter and a third of milk produced in Northern Ireland dairy farms goes to Ireland for processing,” he says. “So if you are one of those farmers, your milk will be hit with a very high tariff – it would not be viable to send it. “It is the same for sheep. About 400,000 sheep each year go from NI to factories in Ireland for processing. If the WTO tariffs apply, then it simply would not be viable.” Colm McKenna People who own petrol stations along the border know all about boom and bust - trade depends on currency fluctuations and significantly lower fuel duty rates in the Republic of Ireland. Enda McColgan, manager of the Texaco in Muff, says 90% of the garage’s customers come from Northern Ireland to top up. Business is booming. There was one stage when demand was so great they even had to employ somebody to manage the traffic on the road outside. Enda McColgan: Business is booming Garage owner Colm McKenna remembers bombings, the checkpoints and the days of soldiers in ditches. “If we had a hard border then we’d be going back 30 years in six weeks to six months,” he says. It’s not hard to imagine who might target such a border, he points out. Some have warned that a hard border could be used as a justification for violence by dissident republicans who do not support the current peace agreements in Northern Ireland. Kevin Melarkey Not far away, at another crossing, Kevin Melarkey is the egg man on the border at Bridgend near Derry. He's there at the farm shop seven days a week - in a small hut - selling eggs and bags of spuds. He has a good thick coat and a pair of mountain boots to keep out the cold. When he gets a minute, he can stand outside his hut and rest his eyes on the blue hills of Donegal. He's too young to remember much more than the queues at the checkpoints on a Sunday when half of the city decamped across the border to Buncrana or to buy cheap petrol. Like everyone else, he does not know what Brexit will bring. “We're in limbo, it's just a waiting game,” he sighs. Brexit and border changes will be more significant for Northern Ireland, says Katie Daughen, head of Brexit Research and Support Services to the British/Irish Chamber of Commerce. Every year 31% of NI exports are to the Republic and 27% of its imports come from there. The main sector to be affected is food and agriculture. “It’s worth over £4.5bn to the economy in the north and it’s by far the most exposed.” Katie Daughen: Changes will be more significant north of the border Daughen lists a couple of examples of the all-island nature of the economy: • Wheat grown in the south is processed in north•    40% of chicken produced in the south is processed in the north One of Ireland’s most famous exports faces similar problems. Guinness is brewed in Dublin in the Republic of Ireland. But it’s sent north of the border to be bottled or canned before returning to Dublin for export to the world. But it is not all doom and gloom.  There are opportunities out there too. The border’s disappearance was a gradual shift - like ice melting. After the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, things moved slowly. But the dragon’s teeth  - ugly concrete blocks squatting on hundreds of country roads linking north and south -  were suddenly yanked. The soldiers in their camouflage passed out of view. In 2003, they took away the checkpoint at Newry. They pulled down the ugly iron cage, the military turret high on the hill above the church at Cloughoge. The tower above Cloughoge The people who felt safer for the presence of the Army on the hilltop called it a watchtower. Those who resented the Army, and their high power cameras, preferred “spy post”. It was close to that Newry border where Lord Justice Gibson and his wife Cecily were killed by an IRA bomb in 1987. 1987: Wreckage from the explosion which killed Lord Justice Gibson and his wife A year later, Robin and Maureen Hanna and their son, David, six, died in an IRA explosion after crossing the border. The family from Hillsborough in the north were returning from holiday when their vehicle was mistaken for one belonging to a senior judge. The big military turret went up on the hill after that. It was a stretch of road that became a no-man’s land between north and south. It was not a place for a friendly chat - there was tension in the air, the soldiers were edgy. Crossings were never easy. Many resented the waiting and the questioning. People were afraid they might get caught up, a sitting target for a bomber. Or scared that a soldier might even get trigger happy. But there was another side to the old border too. The game of “catch me if you can” with the customs officers still raises a smile. A customs post on the Belfast-Dublin road in the 1950s Butter was cheaper  on one side – hide it in the pram and sit the child on top. It was all the sweeter for being illicit. Young couples from the north took the train to Dublin to buy the wedding ring. There are tales of dangling the ring out of the train window on a thread on the way home to evade the keen eye of the customs man. In Fermanagh, drive down past the town of Enniskillen and on to the border towns of Belcoo and Blacklion and you see how past and present merge. The stone bridge marks the crossing point between north and south. The bus stop in Belcoo has two sets of signs – a blue and white sign for the Ulsterbus and a green one with a greyhound for Bus Éireann. The street signs are in both English and Irish. Harold Johnston has an old-fashioned shop just over the bridge in Blacklion. His grandmother opened it in 1901. “She was a trained seamstress and had five dressmakers upstairs at one time. She used to do wedding dresses and red flannel petticoats.” A century later, her grandson presides over an Aladdin’s cave. It is a drapery and a clothes shop and a wool shop and whatever you like. The shoe boxes are piled high, there are rolls of oilskin tablecloth propped up. From the door, Johnston can look left to where the customs post and Irish gardaí once stood, checking the cars coming south. “There were 43 guards and six sergeants at that border,” he says. “We had 24-hour cover and two shifts. We had patrol cars patrolling the back roads. “They were stationed in the barracks on the left.  The young lads were sent up from Dublin for training along the border.” In the 1930s, the Depression hit hard but on 3 September 1939 trade exploded on his side of the bridge when war was declared. “They were putting restrictions in the north and it was scarcity this and scarcity that. But we had lots of butter and sugar.” Harold Johnston Smuggling was rife. Johnston tells a story about the undertaker in Blacklion in the Republic who was running short on shrouds, but had a friend across the border in Belcoo who knew another man that could get him some. The problem was getting them over the bridge from north to south. “Yer man came into the bar in Blacklion and said the parcel had arrived and he had it with him,” Johnston says. “So he went into the kitchen and he had on a coat three times too big and he opened it and he had put all the shrouds on himself and walked over the border like that. “As he took the shrouds off in the kitchen at the back, yer man looked at him and said: ‘It’s the first time I’ve ever seen a man taking a shroud off’.” During the Troubles, there were just 20 official border crossings between Northern Ireland and the Republic. The British Army shut down, spiked or cratered the rest. With peace, the country relaxed, breathed a sigh of relief, and unspiked the roads. Trade and business became more fluid – it blossomed. Businesses in Northern Ireland set up offices in the Republic and vice versa. Seamus Leheny from the Northern Ireland Freight Transport Association knows the pain of those whose businesses may be disrupted by Brexit. An Irish revenue commissioner has said up to 8% of freight crossing the border might be subject to checks after Brexit. With a minimum of 6,000 lorries trundling over the border every day, you begin to see the scale of the problem. “That makes at least 500 lorries that could be checked every day,"" says Leheny. ""Added to that is the thought that drivers selected for checking might have to drive away from the main flow of traffic to a specific post – and distance costs money. Even if there are to be checks it doesn't necessarily follow that there will be a string of traditional border posts with long queues of lorries. The head of the Irish tax authorities has said he is ""practically 100% certain"" there will be no new customs posts along the border after Brexit. Niall Cody said businesses, however, must assume there will be “some form of customs” post-Brexit - it might be that people would be allowed to make declarations online. Ongoing analysis of cross-border trade increasingly shows that most goods transported between the jurisdictions will not need to be physically checked, Cody suggested. Still, there are those who might be less than scrupulous and could take advantage by shipping goods into Belfast and straight into the EU via Dublin – without paying the tariffs. Then, think about the large retailers who treat the island of Ireland as an entity – one market. They get the goods to Belfast, use distribution centres to sort and store, and send them on by lorry on to Galway, Cork and Dublin. “They may ship directly rather than go through a whole bureaucratic process. Jobs could be lost in Northern Ireland,” Leheny says. Eamon O'Farrell, a former customs officer in Donegal who spent 30 years patrolling the border, says the Irish authorities are “ill equipped” to deal with border checks. It's not the main roads, it's the hundreds of unapproved roads. “I cannot figure out how they're going to do this with the resources that I understand they have,” he says. “You wouldn't get 12 people across the whole border who know where the actual border is. We're talking about the revenue risk, tax evasion, various types of smuggling - goods and people.” On the ground, people are thinking ahead. There are cross-border meetings and countless committees working out the logistics of a border that is longer than the length of the island of Ireland. At government level, civil servants in London are getting their heads around the conundrum of Northern Ireland. One thing that looks likely to continue is the Common Travel Area (CTA), the bilateral UK-Ireland agreement that allows for free movement of UK and Irish citizens between Ireland, Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. The arrangement allows Irish and UK citizens the right to work, to access public services and to vote in certain elections, and Brexit Secretary David Davis has described the continuation of the CTA as ""non-negotiable"". Jane Morrice, former head of the European Commission office in Northern Ireland, helped broker the Good Friday Agreement during her time as a politician. She wants to maintain the status quo on the island of Ireland. She is proposing that Northern Ireland should have honorary membership of the EU after the UK's departure. “We've made such good progress since the Good Friday Agreement. Removing the border and removing borders in mind as well as geographically has been hugely successful and we cannot allow ourselves to halt that or reverse it in any way,” she says. “The role played by the EU in the peace process was instrumental.” Border dwellers are hardy as the weeds and thistles sprouting from the old huts at the customs posts. They have come through partition and war and the Troubles. Harold Johnston tells the story of a villager in the 1920s who travelled up the road to Enniskillen in Northern Ireland for his groceries every week. Partition hit home on the very day of his weekly shop. On his return journey, a fresh new customs hut had sprung up at the border and a man in a starched uniform was waiting for him. “You can’t bring those goods into the Free State,” said the customs man. “But I always have,” said the man. “Well, you can’t now,” said the new officer. The man turned back for a sit and a think in nearby Belcoo, Northern Ireland. What did he do? Johnston pauses and smiles. “He sat and waited for the customs officer to shut up shop for the night and sure didn’t he just walk over the border.” There is always a way.
