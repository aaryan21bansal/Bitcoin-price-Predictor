"Heathrow Airport has criticised Border Force after passengers faced ""unacceptable queuing times"". Images on social media showed packed queues at the west London airport on Friday night, with travellers complaining of waits of several hours. A Heathrow spokesman apologised for the delays, but blamed Border Force for not providing enough staff at immigration. The Home Office, which has responsibility for Border Force, said the wait times were ""unacceptable"". It said Border Force was ""rapidly reviewing its rosters and capacity and flexibly deploying our staff across the airport to improve waiting times"". Travel changes make little difference - airport boss Which countries have been added to the green list? What is the EU vaccine 'passport' and can I use it? Travellers at Heathrow used social media to complain about lengthy queues with inadequate ventilation, while some claimed people had fainted while they were waiting. One Twitter user said: ""There are people collapsing in Terminal 5 Arrivals due to overcrowding and no ventilation. Some Covid secure measuresâ¦"" Another said: ""Horrendous kettling at Heathrow Terminal 5 arrivals tonight. No Border Force. No ventilation. No fire exits. No explanation. Held there for over an hour. People fainting. Panicked skeleton Heathrow ground team not knowing what to do."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

On Saturday morning, Heathrow Airporttweeted,externalthat it was unable to say how long travellers would have to queue for immigration. In a subsequent statement, the airport said it had ""escalated"" the issue with Border Force and expected it to provide a better service over the weekend. A Heathrow spokesperson said: ""We are very sorry that passengers faced unacceptable queuing times in immigration due to too few Border Force officers on duty. ""Border Force were aware of the extra demand from families and we are very disappointed that they did not provide sufficient resource. ""We have additional Heathrow colleagues to support in managing queues and to hand out passenger welfare including water, but we need every immigration desk to be staffed at peak times. ""We have escalated this with Border Force and expect them to provide a better service over the remainder of the weekend."" The Home Office said it was the busiest weekend of the year for returning passengers, with particularly high numbers of families with children under the age of 12 who cannot use e-gates. E-gates allow travellers with biometric passports to bypass manual inspections when they cross border control. A Home Office spokesman said: ""Throughout the pandemic we have been clear that queue times may be longer as we ensure all passengers are compliant with the health measures put in place to keep the UK public safe. However, the very long wait times we saw at Heathrow last night are unacceptable... ""Border Force is rapidly reviewing its rosters and capacity and flexibly deploying our staff across the airport to improve waiting times."" The Home Office added that Border Force was working closely with Heathrow Airport and its airlines and was committed to ensuring passengers had ""a safe and hassle-free journey"". The ISU union, which represents borders, immigration and customs staff, said Border Force had been ""chronically under-funded for years"" at major airports, with new recruits directed to inland and international trade to address issues arising from Brexit. Speaking about the scenes on Friday, an ISU spokeswoman said: ""It will happen again. Not just at Terminal 5 but potentially at any large airport."" More people have travelled overseas after the government relaxed some travel restrictions The UK's travelling restrictions were eased for many on 19 July, when the government dropped the requirement to quarantine after returning from amber list destinations for children and fully vaccinated adults. Most countries - including the UK's most popular holiday destinations - are on the amber list. Travellers coming from green list countries do not need to quarantine when they come back to the UK - whether or not they have had two doses of a coronavirus vaccine. However, travellers from green and amber destinations must have one test before returning to Britain and another two days after they get back. Only British nationals can enter the UK directly from a red list country, and they must pay to quarantine in government-approved hotels and be tested. The travel industry has criticised the UK's changing travel rules, with airlines saying the system risked making international travel ""more expensive, burdensome and uncertain compared to other countries"". Travel lists are currently updated every three weeks and the system is similar for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Countries are placed on different coloured listsdepending on the Covid situationin each nation Green list countriesare said tocarry the lowest risk for travellers- and so isolation is not required, though testing pre-arrival and on day two is needed Most countries - including the UK'smost popular holiday destinations- are on the amber list Amber list arrivalsdo not need to isolateif they are fully vaccinatedor under-18 - buttesting is requiredpre-arrival and on day two after landing Those who haveyet to have both jabswill need to isolate and take additional Covid tests Only British nationals can enter the UK directly from ared list countryandthey must pay to quarantine in special hotelsand be tested.

"More than 8,700 chain stores closed in British High Streets, shopping centres and retail parks in the first six months of this year, research suggests. That is an average of nearly 50 outlets a day as the impact of the pandemic and changing shopping habits continue to hit many towns and city centres. But despite some high-profile retail failures, the number of closures has fallen compared with a year earlier. City centres have suffered the worst, while retail parks are faring better. The store closure figures were collected by the Local Data Company on behalf of accountancy firm PwC. ""After an acceleration in store closures last year couple with last minute Christmas tier restrictions and lockdowns extending into 2021, we might have expected a higher number of store closures this year,"" says Lisa Hooker, consumer markets lead at PwC. She believes continued government support combined with resilient consumer spending has helped many operators weather the storm and survive the pandemic. UK loses 83% of department stores over five years The experiences replacing closed High Street stores The Local Data Company tracked more than 200,000 stores operated by businesses with more five outlets across Great Britain. These include everything from retail and restaurants, to cafes, banks and gyms. As the chart below shows, although 3,488 stores opened in the first six months of 2021 the closures were far greater. A total of 8,739 shops shut creating a net decline of 5,251 outlets - a huge number, but 750 less than this time last year. Fashion retailers recorded the biggest decline reflecting the collapse of Sir Philip Green's retail empire which saw his brands, including TopShop and Dorothy Perkins, disappear from the High Street. More than 120 department stores also shut for good. There was also a decline in car showrooms, betting shops and banks, providing yet more evidence of changing shopping behaviour and the shift to online. Data also shows that store openings were at their lowest level for six years. Leisure dominated the growth with takeaway chains leading the way. And it is city centres that are still suffering the most, declining faster than suburban areas which are being supported by people working from home. London, for instance, has gone from being the best performing region in 2016 to the worst for two years running. Retail parks have fared best of all. Many are anchored by supermarkets, DIY and furniture retailers which have all done well during the pandemic. Footfall at these sites is almost back to pre-pandemic levels, showing how shoppers seem happier to drive to bigger shops than visit High Streets and shopping centres in towns. However, there is still an appetite for new space on the High Street. Gail's Bakery has just opened a new outlet in Kew, a suburb in south west London, in what was once a branch of Barclays bank.  The chain has opened four bakeries during the pandemic, seizing the opportunity to take advantage of cheaper rents and a change in consumer behaviour. Gail's co-founder and chief executive Tom Molnar ""I definitely think people are eating better food more often and more often at home and I think that's a great trend for us,"" says co-founder and chief executive, Tom Molnar. ""Instead of using Gail's as a treat, they're using it more as a staple, ""When rents go down, more creative-based businesses can survive... I do have some confidence that new ideas will come in [to the High Street],"" he says. So is the worst now over from the turmoil of the last few years? These latest closures follows the loss of more than 17,500 chain outlets last year. ""There are promising signs that the speed of the decline we were tracking across the worst of the pandemic is slowing,"" says Lucy Stainton, head of retail and strategic partnerships at the Local Data Company. ""That being said, the compound impact of multiple lockdowns can't be ignored and whilst a slowdown in store closures is certainly welcome, the volume of empty units across Great Britain is at a record high with no sign that the demand will ever be there to meet the supply."" The next six months will be make or break for many chains, according to PwC's Lisa Hooker. ""Operators are far from out of the woods... particularly with the reinstatement of full business rates for all but the smallest operators, the winding-down of furlough support and agreement yet to be reached between many operators and landlords on rent arrears, "" she says. ""But the good news is that there are some green shoots of optimism. Consumers still want a shopping experience and a number of chain stores and restaurants are opening.""

"Emma Raducanu has reached the last 16 in back-to-back Grand Slams US Open 2021 Venue:Flushing Meadows, New YorkDate:30 August-12 September Coverage:Daily radio commentaries on BBC Radio 5 Live Sports Extra/BBC Sport website and app, with selected live text commentaries and match reports on the website and app British teenager Emma Raducanu thrashed Spain's Sara Sorribes Tormo in a one-sided US Open encounter and will face American Shelby Rogers in the last 16. Raducanu, 18, won 6-0 6-1 against world number 41 Sorribes Tormo as her overseas Grand Slam debut continued with an extraordinary win in New York. She will play Rogers on Monday after the world number 43stunned Australian top seed Ashleigh Barty. ""My game is just getting better with each match,"" said Raducanu. After bursting on to the Grand Slam scene with a stunning run to the Wimbledon last 16 as a wildcard, the world number 150 has now matched that breakout display at Flushing Meadows. Sorribes Tormo is the highest-ranked player Raducanu has beaten in her fledgling professional career. ""I was playing very well and I know Sara is a tough opponent so I had to be on my game and worked so hard,"" said Raducanu, who won in one hour nine minutes. ""I'm happy I maintained and stayed consistent."" Djokovic fights back to beat Nishikori and reach fourth round Andreescu and Sakkari through to fourth round Stephens reveals '2,000-plus' messages of abuse after loss Salisbury & Skupski both reach doubles last eight The manner of the teenager's victory was scarcely believable, overwhelming an industrious opponent who has reached a career-high ranking after winning 29 tour matches this year. Raducanu's power and precision was too much for Sorribes Tormo to handle. The Briton walloped 23 winners and served solidly throughout, too. Fittingly she sealed victory with another thunderous forehand winner before taking the acclaim of a New York crowd which appears to realise they are watching a star in the making. ""I had to hit through her and hit the corners,"" said Raducanu, whose number of winners outweighed 16 unforced errors. ""If you trade against her you come second best and I took the game to her and I hit more winners than errors."" Raducanu has been a popular attraction for US Open fans on the outside courts Three months ago, few outside British tennis knew Raducanu. Then she was ranked 361 in the world. After her stunning run at Wimbledon she became a household name in the UK and is now attracting plenty of attention from the New York crowd, many of whom who wanted selfies and autographs after she beat Sorribes Tormo. Victory also means the Kent teenager is on the verge of climbing into the world's top 100. Raducanu qualified for her first major last week and, unfazed by the magnitude of playing in her first overseas Grand Slam, has continued to create a buzz at Flushing Meadows. In three qualifying matches and three main-draw matches, she has not dropped a set. ""It was an unbelievably impressive performance from such a young player. She has absolutely nothing to lose,"" former British number one Laura Robson said on BBC Radio 5 Live Sports Extra. ""We kept bigging this match up as a tough opponent - and it is a tough opponent. Sorribes Tormo has won so many matches against top players and has the game to really get you in trouble. ""But she was never in it. She didn't have the chance to play her game because Emma hit her off the court."" Raducanu quickly stamped her authority in the opening stages, breaking 24-year-old Sorribes Tormo's serve at the third attempt in a lengthy second game. From then on it was one-way traffic as the Briton won 29 of the 42 points played in the first set. Former British number one Tim Henman called Raducanu's first-set performance ""a ball-striking clinic"". She continued to press in the second set, breaking serve at the first opportunity for a 2-0 lead. With her head in her hands, Sorribes Tormo looks shell-shocked as she trailed 3-0 at the changeover. Raducanu refused to ease off as she chased a second set to love, maintaining her intensity as the Spaniard battled to get on the scoreboard. There was a huge cheer as Sorribes Tormo did hold serve for 5-1, after fighting off a match point, but could not further delay the inevitable as Raducanu maintained her composure to serve out a one-sided victory. ""The level was silly,"" added Robson, who also reached the US Open fourth round as an 18-year-old in 2012. ""A lot of young players can hit the ball hard, but to be this consistent and be able to back yourself is unbelievable."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"High numbers of workers in restaurants and hotels have been furloughed but many are now returning to work Job creation looks set to remain strong after the furlough scheme ends, but a fresh rise in unemployment is still likely, a think tank has said. Thanks to the success of furlough, an expected pandemic-driven surge in joblessness has not materialised, said the Resolution Foundation. But it warned that about 900,000 people are still expected to be on the scheme when it finishes on 30 September. As a result, ""huge uncertainty"" surrounds what might happen next. ""The Foundation expects many of these employees to return to their previous role - especially those on partial furlough - upon the scheme's closure,"" it said in its latest labour market report. ""But with the number of people starting new jobs already at record highs - and potentially hitting two million for the time ever this autumn - firms are unlikely to have the capacity to immediately take on all previously furloughed staff who do lose their job."" What's happening with the people still on furlough? BA warns of serious cost problems as furlough ends Furlough was introduced in spring 2020, to stop people being laid off by their employers during lockdown. It applies across the UK. The government initially paid 80% of the wages of people who could not work, or whose employers could no longer afford to pay them, up to a monthly limit of Â£2,500. In July 2021, employers were required to pay 10% of salaries - with the government's contribution falling to 70%. In August and September, the government's contribution reduced further: it now pays 60% and employers pay 20%. The government says 11.6 million jobs have been supported since the scheme began. The Resolution Foundation said it was possible that unemployment would rise from its current level of 4.4% to about 4.9% in the autumn, with another 150,000 workers unemployed. ""Faced with this uncertainly,"" it said, ""employment support schemes, such as Kickstart and Restart, will prove particularly important in protecting vulnerable groups. ""Restart will be particularly important for older workers, who are now the most likely age group to be on furlough, and who are most likely to have been on the scheme for at least six months."" It added that there would be a need to maintain wider economic support, including keeping the Â£20-a-week boost to Universal Credit that is set to end at the same time as the furlough scheme. Hannah Slaughter, economist at the Resolution Foundation, said the furlough scheme had ""prevented an unemployment catastrophe"". ""But with the scheme ending in less than four weeks' time, there is huge uncertainty about what will happen next to the jobs market,"" she said. Ms Slaughter added: ""With firms already reporting 'hiring bottlenecks', even a fresh surge in job starts is unlikely to be enough to prevent unemployment rising this autumn. ""Given the uncertainty surrounding the labour market, the chancellor should maintain the Â£20-a-week uplift to Universal Credit. Cutting support while unemployment is rising is bad politics, bad economics, and bad for living standards."" The government has declined to extend furlough again or reverse the Universal Credit cut, saying that as the economy opens up, the focus needs to shift to getting people back to work.

"Tuna swim long distances as they migrate Tuna are starting to recover after being fished to the edge of extinction, scientists have revealed. Numbers are bouncing back following a decade of conservation efforts, according to the official tally of threatened species. But some tuna stocks remain in severe decline, said the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), which compiles the extinction Red List. It said pressures on marine life are continuing to grow. And almost four in ten sharks and rays are now threatened with extinction. Meanwhile, on land, the Komodo dragon is moving closer to oblivion. The heaviest lizard on Earth faces threats from climate change, with fears its habitat could be affected by rising sea levels. One in three wild trees face extinction Poaching drives elephants closer to the brink 'Hedge trimmer' fish facing global extinction Komodo dragons are rapidly losing range in the wild The revised list of the world's endangered plants and animals was released at the start of the world's leading conservation congress, which is taking place in the French city of Marseille from 3 to11 September. The news is a ""powerful sign"" that despite increasing pressure on our oceans, species can recover, if states commit to sustainable practices, said IUCN Director General, Dr Bruno Oberle. Those gathered for the IUCN World Conservation Congress ""must seize the opportunity to boost ambition on biodiversity conservation"", he said. The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species is the ""gold standard"" for measuring how close animal and plant species are to dying out. Some 139,000 species have been assessed over the last half-century, with nearly 39,000 now threatened with extinction, while 902 have gone extinct. Tuna are top predators, keeping other populations healthy The latest update - the second this year - revealed encouraging signs for four of seven tuna species: The Atlantic bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus) moved from Endangered to Least Concern; The Southern bluefin tuna (Thunnus maccoyii) moved from Critically Endangered to Endangered; The albacore (Thunnus alalunga) and yellowfin tunas (Thunnus albacares) both moved from Near Threatened to Least Concern. Tuna stocks in some areas remain of concern, such as bluefin tuna in western parts of the Atlantic and yellowfin in the Indian Ocean. ""The take home message for the general public is that things like albacore tuna - which is the one that is widely on supermarket shelves - is of least concern now - it means that what they're eating has been sustainably caught and is well managed,"" Craig Hilton-Taylor, who heads the IUCN Red List, told BBC News. But he said while some marine species are recovering many others are under huge pressure. ""We can't sit back - this is a wake-up call to the world that we need to do much more about our oceans and the biodiversity in them."" Tuna have been at the forefront of efforts to make fishing practices more sustainable. The likes of skipjack, yellowfin, bigeye and albacore tuna are consumed by millions of people across the world and one of the most commercially valuable fish. Sharks are threatened by overfishing Most types of tuna were deemed at threat of extinction in 2011. After a decade of efforts from conservationists and industry, including strict fishing quotas and a crack-down on illegal fishing, populations in some parts of the ocean appear to be recovering. However, populations of sharks and rays are continuing to plummet. When the group was assessed in 2014, around a third were deemed threatened, but this has risen to 37%, due to pressures from fishing for meat and fins, climate change and pollution. ""The alarm bells couldn't be ringing louder for sharks and rays,"" said Dr Andy Cornish, shark programme leader at the conservation group, WWF. ""We are losing this ancient group of creatures - starting to lose it species by species right here, right now - we desperately need urgent action."" The World Conservation Congress is being held for the first time in five years after being postponed last year due to the pandemic. Over nine days, government ministries, NGOs and indigenous peoples, backed by a network of 16,000 scientists, will hammer out conservation proposals that could set the agenda for upcoming UN summits on biodiversity and climate change. Issues in the spotlight include wildlife trafficking, plastic pollution and protection of the Amazon. A new council will be elected that will set the future direction of the IUCN. Susan Lieberman, vice president of the Wildlife Conservation Society, who is a conference veteran, said the release of the latest update would drive government and multi-lateral action to save threatened and endangered species. She said the meeting, postponed since 2020 and taking place both online and in-person, was crucial for determining the future direction of conservation policy amid the crises of climate change, biodiversity loss and the pandemic.

"More than 8,700 chain stores closed in British High Streets, shopping centres and retail parks in the first six months of this year, research suggests. That is an average of nearly 50 outlets a day as the impact of the pandemic and changing shopping habits continue to hit many towns and city centres. But despite some high-profile retail failures, the number of closures has fallen compared with a year earlier. City centres have suffered the worst, while retail parks are faring better. The store closure figures were collected by the Local Data Company on behalf of accountancy firm PwC. ""After an acceleration in store closures last year couple with last minute Christmas tier restrictions and lockdowns extending into 2021, we might have expected a higher number of store closures this year,"" says Lisa Hooker, consumer markets lead at PwC. She believes continued government support combined with resilient consumer spending has helped many operators weather the storm and survive the pandemic. UK loses 83% of department stores over five years The experiences replacing closed High Street stores The Local Data Company tracked more than 200,000 stores operated by businesses with more five outlets across Great Britain. These include everything from retail and restaurants, to cafes, banks and gyms. As the chart below shows, although 3,488 stores opened in the first six months of 2021 the closures were far greater. A total of 8,739 shops shut creating a net decline of 5,251 outlets - a huge number, but 750 less than this time last year. Fashion retailers recorded the biggest decline reflecting the collapse of Sir Philip Green's retail empire which saw his brands, including TopShop and Dorothy Perkins, disappear from the High Street. More than 120 department stores also shut for good. There was also a decline in car showrooms, betting shops and banks, providing yet more evidence of changing shopping behaviour and the shift to online. Data also shows that store openings were at their lowest level for six years. Leisure dominated the growth with takeaway chains leading the way. And it is city centres that are still suffering the most, declining faster than suburban areas which are being supported by people working from home. London, for instance, has gone from being the best performing region in 2016 to the worst for two years running. Retail parks have fared best of all. Many are anchored by supermarkets, DIY and furniture retailers which have all done well during the pandemic. Footfall at these sites is almost back to pre-pandemic levels, showing how shoppers seem happier to drive to bigger shops than visit High Streets and shopping centres in towns. However, there is still an appetite for new space on the High Street. Gail's Bakery has just opened a new outlet in Kew, a suburb in south west London, in what was once a branch of Barclays bank.  The chain has opened four bakeries during the pandemic, seizing the opportunity to take advantage of cheaper rents and a change in consumer behaviour. Gail's co-founder and chief executive Tom Molnar ""I definitely think people are eating better food more often and more often at home and I think that's a great trend for us,"" says co-founder and chief executive, Tom Molnar. ""Instead of using Gail's as a treat, they're using it more as a staple, ""When rents go down, more creative-based businesses can survive... I do have some confidence that new ideas will come in [to the High Street],"" he says. So is the worst now over from the turmoil of the last few years? These latest closures follows the loss of more than 17,500 chain outlets last year. ""There are promising signs that the speed of the decline we were tracking across the worst of the pandemic is slowing,"" says Lucy Stainton, head of retail and strategic partnerships at the Local Data Company. ""That being said, the compound impact of multiple lockdowns can't be ignored and whilst a slowdown in store closures is certainly welcome, the volume of empty units across Great Britain is at a record high with no sign that the demand will ever be there to meet the supply."" The next six months will be make or break for many chains, according to PwC's Lisa Hooker. ""Operators are far from out of the woods... particularly with the reinstatement of full business rates for all but the smallest operators, the winding-down of furlough support and agreement yet to be reached between many operators and landlords on rent arrears, "" she says. ""But the good news is that there are some green shoots of optimism. Consumers still want a shopping experience and a number of chain stores and restaurants are opening.""

"The Northern Ireland Protocol prevents a hard border with Ireland but some products need to be checked as they arrive from Great Britain. The UK does not want to ""sweep away"" the Northern Ireland Protocol, but the deal risks creating ""cold mistrust"" with the European Union, the UK's Brexit minister has said. Lord Frost repeated calls for Brussels to accept a ""substantial and significant change"" to the deal. The protocol keeps Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods. It prevents a hard border with Ireland but some products need to be checked as they arrive from Great Britain. Not all the checks have been implemented due to what are known as grace periods. What next for the Northern Ireland Protocol? Unionist parties have expressed opposition to the protocol, arguing it has damaged east-west trade and harms the union. On Tuesday, DUP Economy Minister Gordon Lyons called for further delays to Irish Sea border checks. Speaking at the British-Irish Association conference in Oxford, Lord Frost said: ""The stakes are high. The arguments can be bitter. ""And I worry this process is capable of generating a sort of cold mistrust between us and the EU which could spread across the relationship. ""It's holding back the potential for a new era of co-operation between like-minded states in a world which needs us to work together effectively."" Lord Frost reiterated the view that the ""threshold"" for triggering Article 16, which would effectively tear up the protocol, has been met The Conservative peer reiterated the UK's position that the ""threshold"" for triggering Article 16 to effectively tear up parts of protocol has been met. But he added: ""Some would like us to sweep all the existing arrangements away. That is not our position. ""It is obvious there will always need to be a dedicated UK-EU treaty relationship covering Northern Ireland. It is a question of finding the right balance."" Grace periods mean that the introduction of all checks and controls on businesses have not yet been fully implemented. It is to allow industry more time to adapt and prepare. Some significant grace periods are due to expire on 1 October, and at that point some Great Britain-made meat products would be prohibited in Northern Ireland - what has become known as ""the sausage ban"". Another protocol grace period is due to end in January, which could potentially affect theimportation of medicines to Northern Ireland. Northern Ireland gets most of its medicines from distributors in Great Britain, but is still covered by EU medicines rules. The health department has been notified 910 medicines are due to be withdrawn, with a further 2,400 are at risk. It is the deal agreed by the UK and EU to prevent a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland after Brexit. It does this by keeping Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods. This means goods don't have to checked as they cross the Irish border, instead some checks and controls are required on goods entering Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK. This has caused difficulties for some businesses and is opposed by unionist parties in Northern Ireland, which say it undermines Northern Ireland's constitutional position as part of the UK. In July the UK published a ""command paper"" proposing radical changes to the protocol but the EU says it will not renegotiate. The headline on this article was amended on 6 September 2021.

"This video can not be played NZ PM Jacinda Ardern: ""This was a violent attack. It was senseless"" New Zealand PM Jacinda Ardern has vowed to toughen anti-terror laws following Friday's knife attack in Auckland by a man who was under police surveillance. ""We must be willing to make the changes that we know may not necessarily have changed history, but could change the future,"" she said at a news briefing. The man, a Sri Lankan national, stabbed seven people in a supermarket. Three of them are in a critical condition. The attacker, a known supporter of Islamic State, was shot dead by police. He has now been identified as Ahamed Aathil Mohamed Samsudeen, a 32-year-old Tamil, who arrived in New Zealand in 2011 and sought refugee status. Ms Ardern, who described the stabbings as a ""terrorist attack"", said she expected that changes to the country's counter-terrorism legislation would be backed by parliament by the end of September. The legislation is expected to make it easier to convict someone for planning a terror attack. Samsudeen had been arrested a number of times before Friday's incident. But Ms Ardern said that every legal avenue to keep him out of the community had been exhausted. Samsudeen, whose identity was suppressed by court order until now due to his refugee status, arrived in New Zealand on a student visa in 2011. He became a person of national security interest in 2016. As a member of the Tamil minority community, he claimed he and his father had been persecuted in Sri Lanka. He had been under round-the-clock monitoring and heavy surveillance due to concerns about his ideology. Samsudeen was known to multiple agencies, and was also on a terror watchlist. Local media reports said he had recently been sentenced to one year of supervision for possessing IS propaganda. Prosecutors had accused him of plotting a ""lone wolf"" terror attack using knives, but the judge ruled that planning a terror attack was not in itself an offence under existing laws. His internet search history and bookmarks included heroes of Islamic State, Islamic State dress, and New Zealand prison clothes and food, according to Stuff. Questions have been raised about why action against the attacker was not taken before the stabbings - especially since he was under close surveillance. The attacker's family were ""shocked and grieving"", lawyer Davoud Mansouri-Rad, who represented the man in relation to his immigration matters, told Stuff. It happened at the Countdown supermarket at LynnMall in the Auckland district of New Lynn on Friday afternoon. A surveillance team and a specialist tactics group had followed Samsudeen from his home to the supermarket. But while there were concerns about him, officials said they had no reason to think he was planning an attack on Friday. The team believed he was going to do his grocery shopping. After entering the store, however, the Samsudeen got hold of a knife and went on a stabbing spree. Police shot dead the attacker within 60 seconds of the incident Shopper Michelle Miller told Stuff that the man was ""running around like a lunatic"" and attacking people. ""All I heard was a lot of screaming,"" she said. ""[People were] running out, hysterically, just screaming, yelling, scared,"" another witness said, adding that he saw an elderly man lying on the ground with a stab wound. Witnesses also said the attacker had shouted ""Allahu akbar"" (God is greatest). Police commissioner Andrew Coster said said police rushed over upon hearing the commotion and shot and killed the attacker when he charged at the officers with the knife. This happened within 60 seconds of the attack. Were you in the area? Did you witness the incident? If it is safe to do so please share your experiences by emailinghaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external.

"This video can not be played Prof Anthony Harnden, deputy chairman of the JVCI, says there ""isn't a right or wrong answer"" The government believes there is a ""strong case"" for offering Covid jabs to healthy 12-15 year-olds, a source has told the BBC, as it awaits advice from the UK's chief medical officers. On Friday vaccine experts did not recommend a rollout as the benefits on health grounds alone were ""marginal"". They have now asked the chief medical officers to consider the wider implications of extending vaccinations to younger pupils. A decision is expected within days. Government sources believe vaccinating younger children could reduce disruption in schools and help keep infection rates down as winter approaches. Up until now the advice of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) with regards which groups should get the Covid jab has been followed across the UK. On Friday theJCVI recommended widening the existing vaccine programme,externalto include an extra 200,000 12-15 year-olds with specific underlying conditions. But they stopped short of advising in favour of vaccinating healthy children in that age group, saying ""the margin of benefit is considered too small to support universal vaccination... at this time"". What do parents think about vaccinating children? How are schools being kept Covid-safe this term? Why vaccinating all teens is a difficult decision 'Still a chance' healthy teens could be vaccinated Prof Anthony Harnden, the JCVI's deputy chairman, was asked on BBC Breakfast about the potential now for parents to soon be faced with having to make a decision on whether or not to have their child vaccinated when different experts had offered varying opinions. He replied that past decisions on widening the rollout had been ""fairly clear cut"" but for this age group for healthy children there was not a ""right or wrong"". Prof Harnden added: ""We have done our job. We have looked at the data, we have resisted a lot of pressure in terms of people making pronouncements - but we have actually coldly looked at the data."" Should the jab rollout be extended, he said ""parents need to understand what the risks are, what the benefits are and make up their own mind about whether they offer consent or not... vaccinating 12-15 year-olds is not a black and white decision"". Health Secretary Sajid Javid has asked the chief medical officers to consider the rollout of the vaccine to the new age group ""from a broader perspective"". This means the rate of transmission will also be a key consideration for the four chief medical officers. Labour said there was a ""strong case for vaccination to prevent further disruption to children's learning"" and the government must ""move urgently to make a decision"" once the chief medical officers have given their advice. Ministers have let it be known they are keen on getting this age group vaccinated - both through public pronouncements and privately behind the scenes. The argument is that it could reduce school disruption and keep infection levels low. But there's still plenty to consider. Giving this age group jabs would mean time out of class and possibly off school recovering from common side effects such as a mild fever. This is not like the flu jab, which is a simple nasal spray. Its ability to curb spread may be less than first assumed too. It is thought about half of this age group may have been infected already and therefore have natural immunity. The emergence of the Delta variant also means the vaccine is less effective at stopping infection than previously - its main benefit is to prevent serious disease and as these healthy children are at incredibly low risk of that the benefits, as the JCVI points out, are marginal. It is worth remembering that there are six million adults - twice the number in this age group - who still remain completely unvaccinated. Perhaps there's a disproportionate amount of attention given to children? Prof Jason Leitch, Scotland's national clinical director, told the BBC the chief medical officers have been asked for ""advice in the round - not just about the individual risk per kid, but also look at the educational environment, the time off school, the safety of schools"". In Scotland, pupils started returning to the classroom from 11 August. However,cases doubled in a week, with the surge blamed partly on the return of schools after the holidays. And last year, the surge that led to England's second nationwide lockdown gathered pace in September as firstly schools and secondly universities reopened. This video can not be played ""My parents won't let me get the Covid vaccine"" The government has maintained throughout the pandemic that it will follow the advice of scientists. While scientists on the JCVI make recommendations, the chief medical officers directly have the ear of ministers. Prof Chris Whitty is England's chief medical officer, with Dr Frank Atherton, Dr Gregor Smith and Dr Michael McBride holding the roles in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland respectively. Sandra Charleton said her son Charlie had recovered from Covid but she could not be sure he would not have side effects from a vaccine Sandra Carleton said she did not want her 12 year-old son Charlie to have the vaccine. ""He has just recovered from Covid so giving him the vaccine most certainly poses more of a risk than a benefit,"" she said. ""He is fine following Covid but I am not so sure he would have been after the vaccine."" Meanwhile, Sue in Yorkshire says she wanted her children, aged 12 and 13, to have the jab ""as soon as possible"". ""The JCVI is unusually cautious about a vaccine and yet completely incautious about this virus and its impact on children."" Readmore views from parents here. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""If the guidance is this will reduce the disruption for all those young people, yes, we will absolutely back that. ""We have to look at the broader pictureâ¦ In England. specifically, where we have got so few measures now, this is going to be one of the most reassuring ways of telling those 12 to 15 year olds... that is going to minimise the disruption for you."" The new JCVI advice recommends widening the rollout to children with chronic heart, lung and liver conditions who were at much higher risk of Covid than healthy children. The decision not to recommend the vaccine to all healthy children was partly based on concern overan extremely rare side effect of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines that causes heart inflammation, and can lead to palpitations and chest pain. Data from the US, where millions of young teenagers have been vaccinated, suggested there have been 60 cases of the heart condition for every million second doses given to 12 to 17-year-old boys (compared to eight in one million girls). France, Italy, Israel and Ireland have also been offering the vaccine to all children in this age group. But as children are at such low risk from the virus, the JCVI decided vaccination would offer only ""marginal gain"" and, therefore, there was ""insufficient"" evidence to offer mass vaccination to this age group. The JCVI said it was difficult to factor in long Covid in its advice because of the uncertainty over how common it was in children, although it appeared to be less prevalent than in adults. Paediatricians say healthy children with Covid end up in intensive care at a rate of two in one million, but this rises to 100 in one million for children with certain health problems. On Saturday, 37,578 cases of coronavirus werereported in the UK,externaland 120 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. As a parent, how do you feel about your 12-15 year-old being vaccinated?

"The romantic moment that won over so many people online A passing photographer who captured a man's proposal to his girlfriend has tracked down the couple after they melted hearts online. Off-duty soldier Rhian Goddard snapped the moment at a north Wales beauty spot when Daniel Doran asked girlfriend Debbie Walker to marry him. Showing Daniel on bended knee with ring in hand, the romantic image at Conwy castle was a hit on social media. The couple have now asked Rhian to be the photographer at their wedding. Rhian was on leave from the Army Air Corps (AAC) over the bank holiday weekend when she was taking photos of her dog near the castle at sunset. ""I was changing lenses at the time and, as I turned, I saw him [Daniel] getting on one knee and producing the ring box,"" said Rhian. ""I thought, 'Oh my God' I need to be really quick. By the time I got the lens on and lifted the camera I got that one shot before he got back up and hugged Debbie."" Fascinating moments caught on camera Why did people start to kiss? 'We got engaged after 24 hours' Eager to share the snap with the couple while not spoiling any announcements, Rhian waited a few days before taking to social media with the faint hope of finding them. ""With it being a bank holiday weekend, there were so many tourists around and I thought they could be from anywhere so the chances of reaching them were really slim,"" she said. ""But I guess it tugged on the heartstrings of so many people that it was shared thousands of times."" Allow Facebook content? This article contains content provided by Facebook.

As it turned out, the couple were also from north Wales and had recently celebrated their first anniversary of dating. ""We'd just been to a spa in Conwy and Dan asked if I wanted to go for a meal, but I said I'd rather go for a walk,"" said Debbie, 38. ""He was acting strange, dragging me around trying to go up the wall around the castle, even though I was knackered ""Then we sat on a bench and he got on one knee."" Daniel and Debbie are busy planning their engagement party She added: ""I'm still blown away by the reaction. I've had so many messages and the last week has been a whirlwind. ""The photo is lovely. It really captures the moment of what Dan did. It was a beautiful night."" Now the couple, from Deeside in Flintshire, have invited Rhian to their engagement party next month and are even hoping she will be their wedding photographer, when they set a date. Debbie said: ""We've spoken about it. It all depends on whether she can get the time off to do it and hopefully they can come to the party.""

"Accolade, the wine giant that makes Hardys, has warned that truck driver shortages could hit the busy festive season and push up costs. Robert Foye, its boss, said the firm was being hit by external staff shortages, especially among suppliers, in distribution and delivery. Companies operating in the UK are having to deal with a shortage of lorry drivers. Firms including Wetherspoons and McDonald's have been affected. Lorry driver shortages have also have been blamed on EU workers leaving the UK following Brexit as well as during the pandemic and tax changes making it more expensive for drivers from elsewhere in Europe to work or be employed in the UK. Mr Foye said: ""These shortages, if they continue, could definitely impact Christmas. We are trying to get ahead of it, but it does depend on the situation for the entire transport and trucking industry in the UK."" Mr Foye also warned that shortages could push up costs. ""The only way we can mitigate this is if we work very closely with our trucking and transport suppliers and our customers. We have done some of that and are managing well so far, but ultimately costs will go up."" Australia's Accolade, the UK's largest wine firm and the world's fifth biggest, delivers 35 million cases to 143 countries every year. Wetherspoons runs low on some beer brands Bin collection delays linked to driver shortage How serious is the HGV driver shortage? Its brands include Hardys, Echo Falls, Kumala, Banrock Station and Stowells. ""Staff shortages are definitely there and there's a whole new group of employees that need to be trained, from truck drivers to restaurant staff,"" Mr Foye added. Consumers are seeing the impact of driver shortages and supply chain strains, from McDonalds halting milkshake sales to supermarkets running out of Diet Coke. The Road Haulage Association (RHA) estimates there is a shortage of about 100,000 drivers. Marc Ostwald, chief economist at ADM ISI, said Western Europe and the US were experiencing similar shortages. ""All the anecdotal evidence suggests that the large pay rises and even signing-on bonuses have done little to alleviate the problem,"" he said. ""Christmas supply delivery problems are highly probable, above all due to the extensive lockdowns over the past two months in China and much of eastern Asia."" Accolade's large Â£100m Park facility in Bristol is the largest wine distribution centre in Europe, with capacity to fill over a million bottles per year and distribute more than 180 million litres of wine annually. The industry has felt the effect of global lockdowns that restricted large swathes of the hospitality industry. Mr Foye said that despite the lifting of UK restrictions, business was taking longer to get back to pre-Covid levels. ""In the UK you're 100% opened up, but because of the effect of Covid, because people's habits have changed and some outlets gone out of business, you're really only at 65% of the level of 2019 levels. We think it's going to take two years to get back to 90-95% level in the UK."" He added: ""Jump over to US, they're opening extremely fast and are at the 90% level."" The firm, which pioneered wine blending back in 1853, predicts rising demand for low alcohol wine - defined as 9.9% alcohol content or less by Accolade - and is about to launch a zero-alcohol wine. ""No or low alcohol will grow 20% plus per year for the next five years and eventually be 15-20% of all wine,"" he said. Australian wine makers are also weathering trade tensions with China after Beijing levied 200% tariffs on Australian wine in March. China is the world's biggest red wine market and was the top buyer of Australian wine before the tariffs hit.

"Lee Cain with the prime minister during the 2019 election campaign Government communications are ""failing in many of its most basic functions"" and need to be overhauled, a former No 10 communications director has said. Lee Cain - who worked for Boris Johnson from 2019 to 2020 - says inexperienced staff and ""endemic"" leaking damaged the government's Covid response. This, he argues in a paper, led to the public receiving mixed messages ""at a critical time"". A UK government spokesperson said: ""These claims are misleading"". In a statement they said: ""[The] Government Communication Service is internationally recognised as a world leader in public communications demonstrated by our work across the globe in over 25 countries."" Mr Cain previously worked on communications for the Vote Leave team during the Brexit referendum and as a special adviser at the Department for Food and Rural Affairs and the Foreign Office. He quit his Downing Street role in December 2020 amid reports of internal tensions. Top Johnson aide quits amid infighting at No 10 Dominic Cummings: The most explosive claims Downing Street scraps White House-style briefings Unlike his ally and former No 10 colleague Dominic Cummings, Mr Cain has been less vocal in his condemnation of how government is run since stepping down. However, his paper for the Institute for Government is strongly critical of the way Whitehall handles media relations and its publicity campaigns. He says the pandemic put the structure under ""increasing pressure"" and that the initial Covid campaigns were ""poor"" because staff did not have an ""adequate understanding of strategic communications or campaigns"". While praising the efforts of many civil servants, he also accuses some press officers of being ""afraid"" to pick up the phone to journalists. Responding to these claims, the government said it had ""set out clear, targeted and effective communications to help the public protect themselves, directly preventing millions of infections and saving thousands of lives"". It said its Covid campaigns were ""reaching an estimated 95% of adults on average 17 times per week at the peak, using every means possible including social media, influencers, radio, TV and widespread digital marketing"". Prior to entering No 10, Lee Cain spent time as a journalist which included a stint following David Cameron around dressed as a chicken Mr Cain proposes cutting the number of communications officers in Whitehall from 8,000 to 2,000, but also suggests improving the training available. Specifically he says staff need to be trained so they can produce video clips, use social media and design graphics. He noted that in the early days of the pandemic, ""put starkly, there was nobody with the ability to create slides for the daily press conference"" and that often the slides were only sent ""moments before press conferences were due to begin"". The daily press conferences were introduced at the start of the pandemic, and the government had planned to implement daily televised briefings covering all its business. In April the plan was scrapped, but Mr Cain argues there is an ""increased demand"" for content and that ""change is inevitable"". He says the PM should continue doing televised news briefings after the end of the pandemic in a bid to improve improve transparency and accountability. Mr Cain also expresses concern about the ""millions of pounds of public money"" being ""squandered annually"". He notes that in 2020/21, Â£600m was spent on 160 campaigns that have ""little impact on the public and simply weren't needed"".

"This video can not be played NZ PM Jacinda Ardern: ""This was a violent attack. It was senseless"" New Zealand PM Jacinda Ardern has vowed to toughen anti-terror laws following Friday's knife attack in Auckland by a man who was under police surveillance. ""We must be willing to make the changes that we know may not necessarily have changed history, but could change the future,"" she said at a news briefing. The man, a Sri Lankan national, stabbed seven people in a supermarket. Three of them are in a critical condition. The attacker, a known supporter of Islamic State, was shot dead by police. He has now been identified as Ahamed Aathil Mohamed Samsudeen, a 32-year-old Tamil, who arrived in New Zealand in 2011 and sought refugee status. Ms Ardern, who described the stabbings as a ""terrorist attack"", said she expected that changes to the country's counter-terrorism legislation would be backed by parliament by the end of September. The legislation is expected to make it easier to convict someone for planning a terror attack. Samsudeen had been arrested a number of times before Friday's incident. But Ms Ardern said that every legal avenue to keep him out of the community had been exhausted. Samsudeen, whose identity was suppressed by court order until now due to his refugee status, arrived in New Zealand on a student visa in 2011. He became a person of national security interest in 2016. As a member of the Tamil minority community, he claimed he and his father had been persecuted in Sri Lanka. He had been under round-the-clock monitoring and heavy surveillance due to concerns about his ideology. Samsudeen was known to multiple agencies, and was also on a terror watchlist. Local media reports said he had recently been sentenced to one year of supervision for possessing IS propaganda. Prosecutors had accused him of plotting a ""lone wolf"" terror attack using knives, but the judge ruled that planning a terror attack was not in itself an offence under existing laws. His internet search history and bookmarks included heroes of Islamic State, Islamic State dress, and New Zealand prison clothes and food, according to Stuff. Questions have been raised about why action against the attacker was not taken before the stabbings - especially since he was under close surveillance. The attacker's family were ""shocked and grieving"", lawyer Davoud Mansouri-Rad, who represented the man in relation to his immigration matters, told Stuff. It happened at the Countdown supermarket at LynnMall in the Auckland district of New Lynn on Friday afternoon. A surveillance team and a specialist tactics group had followed Samsudeen from his home to the supermarket. But while there were concerns about him, officials said they had no reason to think he was planning an attack on Friday. The team believed he was going to do his grocery shopping. After entering the store, however, the Samsudeen got hold of a knife and went on a stabbing spree. Police shot dead the attacker within 60 seconds of the incident Shopper Michelle Miller told Stuff that the man was ""running around like a lunatic"" and attacking people. ""All I heard was a lot of screaming,"" she said. ""[People were] running out, hysterically, just screaming, yelling, scared,"" another witness said, adding that he saw an elderly man lying on the ground with a stab wound. Witnesses also said the attacker had shouted ""Allahu akbar"" (God is greatest). Police commissioner Andrew Coster said said police rushed over upon hearing the commotion and shot and killed the attacker when he charged at the officers with the knife. This happened within 60 seconds of the attack. Were you in the area? Did you witness the incident? If it is safe to do so please share your experiences by emailinghaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external.

"Yeovil Town footballer Lee Collins died in March The partner of a professional footballer who killed himself is backing calls for welfare officers for players. Yeovil Town captainLee Collins was found dead in a hotel room on 31 March. His partner Rachel Gibbon said he was nearing the end of his 14-year career and was worried over what to do next. The Professional Footballers Association (PFA) says it is committed to continually improving its education and wellbeing support for players. The idea of welfare officers was first suggested by a former teammate of Mr Collins from his time at Port Vale, Adam Yates, whowrote an open letter to the PFAon the matter. Mr Yates explained: ""It's somebody who can be there for a conversation, a little bit of guidance and who can escalate it to a someone more professional outside of football."" Ms Gibbon said there had been ""no support"" for her partner, who had three children. Recalling the period before his death, she said: ""Towards the end he was a different Lee. He was down, he was insecure, he was shy, he was broken. ""Football is all he's ever known from coming through the academies at [Wolverhampton Wanderers] - he's never had a 'proper job' per se. ""He didn't want to go into coaching or management of the game, that wasn't Lee, so what to do next was a real worry."" Lee was a fantastic dad, his partner Rachel Gibbon said Ms Gibbon said the welfare officer role could be fulfilled by ex-footballers. ""It also gives past players who aren't too sure what they want to do in the future the opportunity of a role to stay within the football community but not be attached to coaching or management."" She said: ""We now have to live with the consequences of no support, not being enough opportunity for players to speak to somebody. If this helps just one player, then it's 100% worth it."" A PFA spokesperson said: ""We have identified a wide range of football-specific areas that can adversely impact a player's mental health. ""We are committed to continually improving our education and wellbeing support, which also includes evaluating the way football as a whole supports players.""

Yeovil Town captainLee Collins was found dead in a hotel room on 31 March. His partner Rachel Gibbon said he was nearing the end of his 14-year career and was worried over what to do next. The Professional Footballers Association (PFA) says it is committed to continually improving its education and wellbeing support for players. The idea of welfare officers was first suggested by a former teammate of Mr Collins from his time at Port Vale, Adam Yates, whowrote an open letter to the PFAon the matter. Mr Yates explained: ""It's somebody who can be there for a conversation, a little bit of guidance and who can escalate it to a someone more professional outside of football."" Ms Gibbon said there had been ""no support"" for her partner, who had three children. Recalling the period before his death, she said: ""Towards the end he was a different Lee. He was down, he was insecure, he was shy, he was broken. ""Football is all he's ever known from coming through the academies at [Wolverhampton Wanderers] - he's never had a 'proper job' per se. ""He didn't want to go into coaching or management of the game, that wasn't Lee, so what to do next was a real worry."" Lee was a fantastic dad, his partner Rachel Gibbon said Ms Gibbon said the welfare officer role could be fulfilled by ex-footballers. ""It also gives past players who aren't too sure what they want to do in the future the opportunity of a role to stay within the football community but not be attached to coaching or management.""

"This video can not be played Prof Anthony Harnden, deputy chairman of the JVCI, says there ""isn't a right or wrong answer"" The government believes there is a ""strong case"" for offering Covid jabs to healthy 12-15 year-olds, a source has told the BBC, as it awaits advice from the UK's chief medical officers. On Friday vaccine experts did not recommend a rollout as the benefits on health grounds alone were ""marginal"". They have now asked the chief medical officers to consider the wider implications of extending vaccinations to younger pupils. A decision is expected within days. Government sources believe vaccinating younger children could reduce disruption in schools and help keep infection rates down as winter approaches. Up until now the advice of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) with regards which groups should get the Covid jab has been followed across the UK. On Friday theJCVI recommended widening the existing vaccine programme,externalto include an extra 200,000 12-15 year-olds with specific underlying conditions. But they stopped short of advising in favour of vaccinating healthy children in that age group, saying ""the margin of benefit is considered too small to support universal vaccination... at this time"". What do parents think about vaccinating children? How are schools being kept Covid-safe this term? Why vaccinating all teens is a difficult decision 'Still a chance' healthy teens could be vaccinated Prof Anthony Harnden, the JCVI's deputy chairman, was asked on BBC Breakfast about the potential now for parents to soon be faced with having to make a decision on whether or not to have their child vaccinated when different experts had offered varying opinions. He replied that past decisions on widening the rollout had been ""fairly clear cut"" but for this age group for healthy children there was not a ""right or wrong"". Prof Harnden added: ""We have done our job. We have looked at the data, we have resisted a lot of pressure in terms of people making pronouncements - but we have actually coldly looked at the data."" Should the jab rollout be extended, he said ""parents need to understand what the risks are, what the benefits are and make up their own mind about whether they offer consent or not... vaccinating 12-15 year-olds is not a black and white decision"". Health Secretary Sajid Javid has asked the chief medical officers to consider the rollout of the vaccine to the new age group ""from a broader perspective"". This means the rate of transmission will also be a key consideration for the four chief medical officers. Labour said there was a ""strong case for vaccination to prevent further disruption to children's learning"" and the government must ""move urgently to make a decision"" once the chief medical officers have given their advice. Ministers have let it be known they are keen on getting this age group vaccinated - both through public pronouncements and privately behind the scenes. The argument is that it could reduce school disruption and keep infection levels low. But there's still plenty to consider. Giving this age group jabs would mean time out of class and possibly off school recovering from common side effects such as a mild fever. This is not like the flu jab, which is a simple nasal spray. Its ability to curb spread may be less than first assumed too. It is thought about half of this age group may have been infected already and therefore have natural immunity. The emergence of the Delta variant also means the vaccine is less effective at stopping infection than previously - its main benefit is to prevent serious disease and as these healthy children are at incredibly low risk of that the benefits, as the JCVI points out, are marginal. It is worth remembering that there are six million adults - twice the number in this age group - who still remain completely unvaccinated. Perhaps there's a disproportionate amount of attention given to children? Prof Jason Leitch, Scotland's national clinical director, told the BBC the chief medical officers have been asked for ""advice in the round - not just about the individual risk per kid, but also look at the educational environment, the time off school, the safety of schools"". In Scotland, pupils started returning to the classroom from 11 August. However,cases doubled in a week, with the surge blamed partly on the return of schools after the holidays. And last year, the surge that led to England's second nationwide lockdown gathered pace in September as firstly schools and secondly universities reopened. This video can not be played ""My parents won't let me get the Covid vaccine"" The government has maintained throughout the pandemic that it will follow the advice of scientists. While scientists on the JCVI make recommendations, the chief medical officers directly have the ear of ministers. Prof Chris Whitty is England's chief medical officer, with Dr Frank Atherton, Dr Gregor Smith and Dr Michael McBride holding the roles in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland respectively. Sandra Charleton said her son Charlie had recovered from Covid but she could not be sure he would not have side effects from a vaccine Sandra Carleton said she did not want her 12 year-old son Charlie to have the vaccine. ""He has just recovered from Covid so giving him the vaccine most certainly poses more of a risk than a benefit,"" she said. ""He is fine following Covid but I am not so sure he would have been after the vaccine."" Meanwhile, Sue in Yorkshire says she wanted her children, aged 12 and 13, to have the jab ""as soon as possible"". ""The JCVI is unusually cautious about a vaccine and yet completely incautious about this virus and its impact on children."" Readmore views from parents here. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""If the guidance is this will reduce the disruption for all those young people, yes, we will absolutely back that. ""We have to look at the broader pictureâ¦ In England. specifically, where we have got so few measures now, this is going to be one of the most reassuring ways of telling those 12 to 15 year olds... that is going to minimise the disruption for you."" The new JCVI advice recommends widening the rollout to children with chronic heart, lung and liver conditions who were at much higher risk of Covid than healthy children. The decision not to recommend the vaccine to all healthy children was partly based on concern overan extremely rare side effect of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines that causes heart inflammation, and can lead to palpitations and chest pain. Data from the US, where millions of young teenagers have been vaccinated, suggested there have been 60 cases of the heart condition for every million second doses given to 12 to 17-year-old boys (compared to eight in one million girls). France, Italy, Israel and Ireland have also been offering the vaccine to all children in this age group. But as children are at such low risk from the virus, the JCVI decided vaccination would offer only ""marginal gain"" and, therefore, there was ""insufficient"" evidence to offer mass vaccination to this age group. The JCVI said it was difficult to factor in long Covid in its advice because of the uncertainty over how common it was in children, although it appeared to be less prevalent than in adults. Paediatricians say healthy children with Covid end up in intensive care at a rate of two in one million, but this rises to 100 in one million for children with certain health problems. On Saturday, 37,578 cases of coronavirus werereported in the UK,externaland 120 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. As a parent, how do you feel about your 12-15 year-old being vaccinated?

"""Why are you travelling without a mahram?"" the Taliban guard asks a young Afghan woman about her missing male escort. She sits on her own in the back of a beat-up Kabul yellow taxi as it pulls up to the checkpoint marked, like all the others, by the white Taliban flag with black script. What is allowed now in Kabul, and what is not? The turbaned Talib, rifle slung over shoulder, tells her to call her husband. When she explains she doesn't have a phone, he instructs another taxi driver to take her home to get her husband and bring them back. Once completed, all is resolved. Kabul is still a city of a grinding traffic gridlock, wooden market carts groaning with Afghan green grapes and deep purple plums, and street kids in tattered tunics threading through the melee. Kabul's markets are still open On the surface, the city seems much the same. It's not. It's a capital governed by Taliban statements, and some Taliban on the streets. ""Be careful in how you deal with your people. This nation has suffered a lot. Be gentle,"" urged spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid in an impromptu press conference, flanked by fighters in full combat gear, the first day after the last US soldier flew home. Some things don't need saying. As soon as the Taliban swept, with surprising speed, into Kabul last month, Afghans knew what to do during Taliban rule 2.0. Men stopped shaving to allow beards to grow; women switched bright scarves to black ones and checked the length of their dresses and cloaks. So much else is uncertain, unnerving. ""What should I do?"" many Afghans ask in urgent cries for advice, and assistance to escape, tumbling by the hour onto my phone and computer, and those of countless others around the world. Maryam Rajaee knew what to do when Kabul collapsed. On 15 August, as Taliban fighters surged into the streets, she was conducting a long- awaited workshop for female prosecutors in the attorney general's office. ""We must continue,"" her eager students implored her when she flagged the looming threat. But her class soon resigned itself to this sudden reversal. Since then, Rajaee has been moving from one safe house to the next with her family including two young children. Maryam Rajaee was leading a workshop on female prosecutors when the Taliban took power Her three-year-old daughter, Nilofar, already says she wants to be an engineer; her multi-coloured plastic building blocks sit in the corner of a mud-brick room, a late summer sun streams through the windows. No one is quite sure yet what Taliban leaders mean when they say women and girls will be given ""all their rights within Islam"". Many women, including Rajaee, were told in no uncertain terms, ""don't come back to the office"". Many fear they'll never be allowed to return to the life they lived in a city they no longer feel is their own. ""It is my right to be educated, to have a good job, to participate in society at a high level,"" Rajaee tells us as she sits next to a pile of textbooks for her university degree, and her work heading a unit on gender and human rights awareness. ""All my dreams have been destroyed,"" she reflects, her voice breaking. Two decades of international engagement created a space for new ideas, new identities. Now some lives lived are a liability. ""I have good memories of our Christmas parties, of times we cooked delicious food and we were all so happy,"" reminisces Hameed, who'd been a head chef at the British embassy in Kabul for 13 years. We sit cross-legged on a carpet with his five young children, and a pile of faded photographs and certificates of appreciation for his work. Hameed worked at the British embassy but feels betrayed But Hameed, and some 60 other employees at the embassy were hired through a private contractor. Sources say almost all of the staff directly employed by Britain's foreign office managed to fly out of Kabul before Taliban moved in; contractors were left behind. ""We worked so hard, even during the Covid lockdown. If they don't take us out of here, it is a big betrayal,"" laments Hameed. Britain, like some other Western countries, is promising to find ways to help, in third countries, but for many it's a daunting and dangerous prospect to find new routes out. Some have already fled from this city in haste; some now happily rush in. Taliban fighters stream into Kabul from the provinces. A group from Uruzgan, in central Afghanistan, invite us for a chat as we approach the entrance to Kabul airport. ""I haven't been able to visit Kabul for years,"" says 25-year-old Rafiullah, effusive about his ""great happiness"". Asked about the many educated Afghans his own age who feel their future has disappeared, he waves an olive branch. ""We are all Afghans and the country is now moving toward a good path of peace and prosperity."" ""We are all Afghans,"" the Taliban says In some neighbourhoods, Taliban fighters go house-to-house. There's a knock on the door, a demand to hand over government phones and cars, anything of value from their old job. Sometimes even private cars are seized by Taliban who doubt it could have been afforded without some kind of corruption. In western Kabul, in neighbourhoods like Dasht-e-Barchi, populated largely by members of the minority Hazara community, residents whisper of house searches, of men being taken away. ""I'm scared,"" says one woman who travels into the centre of the city for her job. ""We are telling the Taliban we are our family's only source of income and we have to go to work."" In the heart of Kabul, the queues in front of the banks stretch all the way down the street. Most branches are shut; most have no money. ""It's been a week I have been coming every day to get some money,"" declares one man in the bulging crowd. ""This is a new start just to go backwards."" From rural areas, far from this city in so many ways, come comments of relief that American warplanes have finally left the skies, that fighting has gone. For millions of Afghans who live with deepening hunger and hardship, life hasn't changed one jot in their struggle just to survive. Crowds have been forming outside banks In this time between the collapse of the old order and the creation of the new, many take each day, as it comes. ""Is this history, is this real, I can't believe my eyes what I am seeing,"" says freelance Afghan journalist Ahmed Mangli when we meet by Kabul airport. We talk in a district strewn with rubbish and luggage abandoned during the scramble to board the last military flights during the unprecedented international airlift. Mangli first started working in Kabul when the Taliban were ousted 20 years ago. ""The Taliban spokesman is trying to co-ordinate media but everyone has a weapon, everyone feels they are king,"" he reflects. ""I don't know how long I can take this risk but I want to be part of this history."" Kabul make-up artist: 'Women like me are Taliban targets' The two countries throwing a lifeline to the Taliban Panjshir - the valley trying to hold off the Taliban A historic moment unfolds; a historic past is being undone. Billboards with beaming brides in glittering white gowns and racy red lipstick are now being blacked out. The sweeping street murals of the Art Lords team - which told stories of courageous journalists, committed doctors, a yearning for peace after so much war - are being painted over. The first to go was an image, starkly painted in black and white, to mark the signing of a deal last year in Doha between the Taliban and the United States. A people of poets now struggles to find words. An old friend, Masood Khalili, who's fought on so many fronts over so many years, sends me some verse.
