"Average weekly wages in the UK have reached their highest levels since before the financial crisis. Weekly pay reached Â£512 in the three months to December, which - adjusting for inflation - is the highest since March 2008. Excluding bonuses, earnings grew at an annual rate of 3.2% in the three-month period,official figures show.,external Employment rose by 180,000 to another record high of 32.93 million, while unemployment stayed at 1.29 million. The figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed the number of women in employment increased again - this time by 150,000 in the three months to December to a record high of 15.61 million. Myrto Miltiadou, of the ONS, said: ""In real terms, regular earnings have finally risen above the level seen in early 2008, but pay including bonuses is still below its pre-downturn peak. ""Employment has continued its upward trend, with the rate nudging up to another record high. In particular, the number of women working full-time grew strongly over the past year."" HSBC signals mass job cuts as profits plunge Inflation at lowest for more than three years Employment Minister Mims Davies said: ""As we embark on a new chapter as an independent nation outside the EU, we do so with a record-breaking jobs market and business confidence on the rise. ""With wages still outpacing inflation, UK workers can expect their money to go further as we look ahead to a decade of renewal."" It's always good to have some cheerful news to report, such as the news that wages, after stripping out the effect of inflation, have finally squeaked above their level in March 2008. In other words, your wage can finally buy a little bit more than it could before the banking crisis. So let's celebrate. Hooray. Now let's home in on the amounts. The average wage excluding bonuses is now Â£511.61. In March 2008, the average wage would have bought you Â£510.96 (in 2019 prices). In other words you are 65p better off than you were - 12 years ago. There's always a half-full or a half-empty angle on wage increases. But to many workers, this minor economic landmark will serve less as a cause for celebration and more as a reminder that the past decade has been the worst for improvements in living standards in more than 200 years. The 2008 crisis, caused in part by reckless mismanagement of the banks, is one reason (not the only one) that the average pay packet has failed to do what we used to take for granted - i.e. increase by more than inflation. It used to happen every year. Low-pay think tank the Resolution Foundation points out that if pre-crisis trends for increases in pay in real terms had continued, the average wage would now be Â£141 a week higher. Thomas Pugh, at Capital Economics, said the employment figures proved the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC)was right to leave interest rates unchanged last month. ""The most recent surveys are suggesting that employment growth will continue to pick-up in Q1, which we think will contribute to the MPC keeping rates on hold at its next meeting on 26 March as well,"" he said. However, the Institute of Directors warned: ""The UK jobs market ended last year in fine form, but 2020 may be more challenging for employers. ""As more and more workers enter employment, it becomes harder for firms to recruit the employees they need, with a particular dearth in certain skill sets."" And Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. said: ""The upside surprise to employment growth distracts from an otherwise slightly disappointing report. ""Despite the recovery in business confidence since the general election, the single-month measure of job vacancies was 49,000, or 6%, lower in January than a year earlier, showing no improvement from its recent trend.""

"The European Union has added the Cayman Islands, a UK overseas territory, to its tax havens blacklist. It joins Oman, Fiji and Vanuatu, which have also been accused of failing to crack down on tax abuse. Oxfam, which lobbies for tax reform, said the EU's move was ""encouraging"" but many more places should be blacklisted. As well as the Cayman Islands, additions this year include Panama, Palau and the Seychelles. The EU said the Cayman Islands, which has no income tax, capital gains tax or corporation tax, does not have ""appropriate measures"" in place to prevent tax abuse, allowing firms to register there despite having minimal presence in the territory. The jurisdiction was previously on a ''grey list'' that gave it time to introduce new laws to tackle tax deficiencies. But it did not implement the ""economic substance"" reforms by the deadline as promised,the EU said,external. Cayman Islands' Premier, Alden McLaughlin,,externalsaid the government has approved many reforms sought by the EU and has already contacted the EU about the process of being removed from the blacklist.

Cayman Islands profile UK frustrated in money laundering battle UK told to 'hold fire' on April tech tax The Cayman Islands is the first UK territory to be added to the EU blacklist. Blacklisted countries face difficulties accessing EU funding programmes, while European companies doing business in those jurisdictions have to take additional compliance measures.Â The list, which the EU started in 2017 to put pressure on countries to crack down on tax havens and unfair competition, included 15 countries in 2018 but has shrunk. Officials said that Turkey, which is currently on the ""grey"" list, would not be moved to the blacklist despite concerns about its information sharing with some EU member states. Oxfam, which has campaigned on tax, said other British territories, such as the British Virgin Islands, deserve to be added to the list, as do some places within the EU. ""While it is encouraging that the Cayman Islands has finally been added to the blacklist, the list itself still proves wholly inadequate,"" the organisation said.

"Flood updates from 16-20 February For coverage of flooding across the West Midlands on Friday, as well as all the day's news, sport, travel and weather,follow us on the BBC Midlands Live page. Your local BBC radio station is also following the latest developments.You can listen live on the links below: It comes as more than a month's worth of rain fell in 24 hours in parts of north-west England. The recent flooding is ""scary"" and ""not normal"", warns Environment Agency boss Dave Throup. This is the end of live updates on the flooding today. A couple who run a restaurant in Bridgnorth badly damaged in floods say it could take until the summer before it reopens. The River Severn peaked in the town on Tuesday, leaving a number of homes and businesses flooded. Levels are dropping, but a flood warning remains in force. Joanna Pokorska-Zare and Hamid Zare (pictured), run the Boatyard restaurant and said they hoped this week's floods would soon be nothing but a ""bad memory"". ""At this point we've just got to pick up the pieces and just keep going,"" Joanna said. ""We love the place, we love Bridgnorth, we've got a fantastic community around here so we've had a great response from people willing to help. ""That makes you think 'we've got to make things right'."" A severe flood warning for the River Severn in Ironbridgehas been downgraded by the Environment Agency.,external It's been lowered from the worst level, meaning there's a danger to life, to being a flood warning, meaning flooding is still expected in the area. There are stillfive severe flood warnings in place in the West Midlands,,externaltwo in Herefordshire around Hampton Bishop and three in Worcestershire, covering Upton upon Severn and Uckinghall. Herefordshire has seen the worst flooding ""since records began"" - more than 200 years ago, the council's chief executive said. Alistair Neill said it had been a ""remarkable series of days,"" which had left more than 300 homes flooded across Herefordshire, Shropshire and Worcestershire. ""We think the number will grow,"" he added, ""when we find out in due course."" Forecast rain this week would not be as ""significant in terms of pure volume,"" he said allowing the council to move into ""recovery mode"". ""But there's more rain next week scheduled."" Better flood defences are being called for in Ironbridge after the flooding this week. A severe flood warning remains in force, with the Environment Agency saying there is still a danger to life, although the water has started to recede. TheRiver Severn burst its banks and rose high up the temporary defences earlier this week.,external Council leader Shaun Davies wants fast investment from the government for ""permanent flood barriers designed into the Wharfage and then flood barriers where there aren't any at the moment"". Environment Secretary George Eusticehas said the government was investing Â£2.6bn in flood defences. From the look of the weather forecast for the next 24 hours, while it is an improving picture in terms of rain, we're not completely out of the woods following Storm Dennis. Tonight, the West Midlands will see a few showers which should ease, with milder conditions and rain from the west by dawn. Then tomorrow should be windy, cloudy and mild through much of Friday with rain spreading in at times from the west. Keep up-to-date with the latest forecast for your area with theBBC Weather website. Much of Worcester around the River Severn is still affected by flooding this afternoon, even as levels start to drop. The Environment Agency still hasfive flood warnings covering the city and the surrounding area,externalbut said the river had reached its highest level yesterday. However, with more rain forecast, levels are expected to stay high. The city council's said night shelters willopen again tonight for rough sleepers,externalandapplications for relief funding are open to residents and businesses.,external Calls for more dredging of the River Severn to tackle flooding in Shropshire could do more harm than good, according to a council expert. North Shropshire MP Owen Paterson's called for the action,externalas part of a new flood defence policy, along with more tree planting and soil management. But Dan Wrench, biodiversity officer for Shropshire Council, told BBC Shropshire dredging wasn't the answer. ""In certain places, where there is particular blockages, around bridges and so forth, you need to have some dredging in those areas to ensure free-flow in those spots, but, by and large, dredging is ineffectual and quite harmful in places,"" he said. Peaks on the Rivers Severn and Wye expected tomorrow will be ""significantly less"" than levels registered earlier this week, the Environment Agency has said. At a briefing held to discuss flooding issues across Worcestershire, Herefordshire and Shropshire, the Environment Agency's Dafydd Evans said the rain currently falling in Wales would flow down through Shrewsbury (and beyond to Worcestershire) and Hereford. Forecast rainfall over the next few days will lead to ""normal winter floodsâ, not of the level of Storm Dennis, he said. ""The rainfall total that the Met Office are telling us about are much, much lower than what we had before, so it is saturated and we will see rivers respond to what I would call 'normal winter floods'"". While there are still concerns over further flooding in Ironbridge, Telford and Wrekin Council says works been under way today to clean-up where teams can. It tweeted photos,externalof staff clearing up by the Museum of the Gorge and pumping water from people's homes: There's still a severe flood warning, meaning there's a danger to life,covering the River Severn at the Wharfage, Ironbridge.,external We've seen better weather in general across the West Midlands today but it's worth showing just how much water's still about after Storm Dennis. These two photos are from today in Herefordshire: A flood campaigner urges at risk homes to get insured - and think about how to tackle future events. A sure sign that normal service is starting to return - bins have been collected in the Ironbridge Gorge today.

"Two Britons on the ship, Sally and David Abel, have told their son they have tested positive for the virus Doubts have been raised over whether a British couple on a quarantined cruise ship in Japan have tested positive for coronavirus as earlier believed. The son of Sally and David Abel, from Northamptonshire, told the BBC his parents said they had both tested positive and were going to hospital. However, hours later David Abel suggested on Facebook there had been a ""massive communication error"". The couple are among 74 British nationals on the Diamond Princess ship. The ship, which was quarantined on 3 February, is in the port of Yokohama. On Tuesday, Japanese officials said there were 88 new cases of infection on board the ship, bringing the total to 542 confirmed cases. It is the largest cluster of cases outside China. The Foreign Office said it was ""working to organise a flight back to the UK"" for British nationals and an evacuation is expected to take place within the next two to three days. A spokesman for the Foreign Office said it had ""the utmost concern"" for the British people on the ship and was ""ensuring those who have been diagnosed with coronavirus receive the best possible care in Japan"". China releases largest study on Covid-19 outbreak How do you self-isolate due to coronavirus? Coronavirus: What you need to know Mr and Mrs Abel's son Steve told BBC Breakfast that his father had emailed him on Tuesday morning to tell him they had both tested positive. However, on Tuesday evening,a Facebook post,externalfrom Mr Abel's account explained the confusion over the positive test, saying the Japanese quarantine officials did not speak any English. He added: ""The consulate in Tokyo are being very good with me. I am being listened to and Sally & I feel really well."" This video can not be played Steve Abel, the son of a British couple on board the Diamond Princess, says they are ""in the dark"" Earlier, Steve said he could hear his father vomiting in the bathroom while on the phone to his mother earlier but he believed it was due to ""shock"" rather than a symptom of the disease. The conditions on the ship had made it difficult for his father to manage his type-2 diabetes, he said, adding that he would prefer his parents to be quarantined in the UK ""where the food is more suitable for my dad"". ""I'm not actually that worried about the virus - looking at the recovery stats. It is more about the stress, the diet,"" Steve said. Are coronavirus tests flawed? The noted Wuhan victims of the coronavirus Sport Relief trip moved over coronavirus fear Coronavirus forces Jaguar Land Rover to ship parts in suitcases Steve said the UK government's treatment of his parents had been ""appalling"", adding: ""They haven't got back to us on anything and we have been calling them every day for four or five days."" ""They are very high-spirited people,"" he said. ""But in the last two days I've seen the cracks in the armour and they are getting down."" About 3,700 people are quarantined on board the Diamond Princess Another British passenger on board the ship, Elaine Spencer, said she had been ""very disappointed"" with the UK government's initial response and they should have organised a rescue flight sooner. She told Radio 4's Today programme that British passengers who wanted to get on the rescue flight had to sign an agreement that they would go into quarantine for 14 days on their return to the UK. She said they had received a note from the Foreign Office which told them that if they didn't get on the flight, it was unlikely they would be allowed out of Japan. ""I need to go home, I want to see my family but obviously it's going to be another 14 days (after the flight). I wish that they'd decided to do this last week."" The US chartered two planes to bring back its citizens from the cruise ship The president of Princess Cruises, Jan Swartz, said the company has sent more doctors and nurses on to the ship. There is still uncertainty over whether passengers will be allowed to leave the ship at the end of the 14-day quarantine period on Wednesday. According to official figures on Monday, four Britons with confirmed coronavirus are currently in hospital in Japan. Irish foreign minister Simon Coveney confirmedtwo out of six Irish passengers on the Princess Diamond tested positive for the virusand are being treated in hospital in Japan. Mr Coveney said the passengers have dual citizenship with another EU member state and did not normally live in Ireland - but that the Irish embassy in Tokyo was in contact with them. On Tuesday South Korea joined the list of the countries and territories also planning to get their residents off the ship - a list which already includes Canada, Australia, the UK, Israel and Hong Kong. TheUS has already repatriated more than 300 of its citizensfrom the ship. In a statement in the early hours of Tuesday morning, the Foreign Office said its staff had been making ""necessary arrangements"" with British nationals onboard the ship to organise a flight back to the UK. ""We urge all those who have not yet responded to get in touch immediately,"" it added. Affected British nationals should call the British embassy in Tokyo on +81 3 5211 1100.

Early fears of the ship being affected by the virus meant it was turned away from five ports in Asia.Passengers were allowed off the shipon Friday after no cases were found among the 2,257 people onboard, cruise line firm Holland America said. The 83-year-old American woman tested positive after disembarking from the ship and then travelling to Malaysia. An undisclosed number of Britons who were on the Westerdam are being tested for coronavirus in Cambodia, the Foreign Office said. As of Tuesday at 14:00 GMT,,externalin the UK a total of 4,916 people had been tested for coronavirus. Only nine people have tested positive and the rest have been confirmed negative. In a phone call, President Xi of China thanked Prime Minister Boris Johnson for the UK's donation of ""vital medical equipment"" to help China cope with the virus outbreak, a Downing Street spokeswoman said.

"This video can not be played Leo handed over MDMA and cocaine less than half an hour after being texted How quickly can you get Class A drugs delivered in the UK? In Leeds, students say dealers with business cards can bring them cocaine and ecstasy in half an hour. But as I found out, it can be even quicker than that. I sent the first text to the dealer at 19:35. Twenty minutes later he replied. Seven minutes after that I was passing cash through a car window and being handed two small bags of drugs. Getting hold of cocaine here is quicker - and easier - than ordering a takeaway. And it all started because a dealer approached me and handed over a business card. In the Hyde Park area of Leeds, you don't have to walk far before you're approached. The pattern is repeated again and again: a car pulls up, a card is offered and the man inside promises everything from cannabis to cocaine. ""Coke, weed, MD, pills,"" says the dealer, speaking to me through the window of his white Mercedes. MD is shorthand for MDMA, or ecstasy as it's better known. It's a quick handover. He's gone in 10 seconds, speeding off down a narrow terraced street - and I'm left with a card that has the name Leo printed on it, and a phone number. Student Luke, not his real name, has lived here for a few years now and says it's something that happens all the time - and at one point nearly every time he left his house. ""People [dealers] will usually just pull over in cars, with tinted windows and say something like 'do you guys do coke, do you guys do weed?' And if you say 'yes' they'll just give you a card,"" says Luke. ""I used to live down one of the busier roads, so leaving the house and walking to the shop there would be a lot of people around there handing out cards. ""It would happen a lot. If you went during the right times, it would happen almost every time you went down there."" With so many cards to hand, he found himself texting them a lot. ""It is so easy,"" he says. ""You can just get it - half an hour, max. So all it takes is one impulsive 'right I'm going to do it' and then, half an hour later, it's there."" Leeds has a huge student population - nearly 65,000 people spread across its universities. And lots of them live in Hyde Park. According to the Home Office,external, the number of 16-to-24-year-olds taking Class A drugs is at its highest since 2003. That's mostly driven by an increase in cocaine and ecstasy use. There's a market here. And the dealers know it. ""In our student accommodation, we had post boxes and usually if you opened it to get your post there'd be cards in there,"" CJ says. ""So it wasn't like the first time someone pulled over in a car and handed you one, you'd never seen it before. They were already there."" Some of the business cards being handed out in Leeds I'm standing in Hyde Park when a man walks over and hands me a card. It has a name, a phone number and a ""shh"" emoji printed on it. He's straight in with a list of what he can sell me - and even offers me a price cut if I order from him over one of his rivals. ""We've got loads of MD - Â£15 a gram,"" he says. ""Everyone's doing it at Â£20, but I put it down at Â£15. ""I deliver it: drop-offs, everything. Just give me a text, yeah?"" I spend a few evenings walking around Hyde Park and get handed six cards. All of them are branded differently, seemingly all from different dealers. The bags of cocaine and MDMA sold by Leo Leo, the guy in the white car, had said he could get me ""coke, weed, MD, pills"". So I ask him for some. I text Leo from a bar in Headingley, a Leeds suburb with a big student population about two miles up the road from Hyde Park, and keep my order simple: a gram of MDMA and half a gram of cocaine. He agrees to come to me and doesn't hang about, pulling up on a street outside the bar just seven minutes after answering my text. ""I'm round here all the time,"" Leo told me when he first handed over a card. He looks like a busy guy. After delivering to me, he appears to make two other drops in the same spot that night. Anca Frinculescu from TICTAC Communications But are Leo's drugs what he says they are? People ordering cocaine from a business card in Hyde Park don't have access to testing labs to check what they're buying. Luckily, for the purposes of this BBC Yorkshire investigation, I do. TICTAC Communications helps prisons, the police and the Home Office to identify drugs. If you see a police warning about a high-strength ecstasy pill, chances are it was tested by TICTAC first. Analyst Anca Frinculescu starts by weighing what we've brought. Both samples come in light. Leo has short-changed us by about half a gram. Next they go through a gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer (GC-MS) to check what's in there. ""It separates your sample,"" says Anca. ""If you have more than one substance in your sample, I'm going to get different peaks."" Buying ecstasy 'as easy as buying sweets' What's really in festival drugs? 'The most dangerous time to take MDMA for a generation' The pattern of peaks on the results sheet looks like a seismograph after an earthquake. But in this case the position of the peaks represents different substances. There is a known pattern for cocaine, another for MDMA. If anything else has been cut in then the GC-MS will show that. The testing takes 20 minutes. Both our samples are as advertised: MDMA and cocaine. Drug support worker Nicola Lines fears drugs are becoming normalised Forward Leeds, a local drug and alcohol addiction charity, is where Luke went for help. Nicola Lines, who works for the charity, says business cards have made drugs more accessible. ""Historically if somebody wanted to obtain drugs it would definitely involve some sort of face-to-face interaction with a drug dealer, which some people find quite nerve-wracking,"" she says. ""So it kind of removes a barrier, the fact that you can now call a number... and then have a car come and deliver to your house in less than an hour. ""My fear is that drugs are becoming a lot more normalised."" Luke is two years behind in his studies. He puts a year of that down to mental health problems, exacerbated by drug use. ""It's very easy to feel awful all the time,"" he says. ""And then to have something advertised to you as something that's going to make you feel happy. ""And you take it and it does, and it works - for six hours. And then it's a case of you're drinking more, you're taking more, because it makes you feel better at the time."" Luke was so low he attempted suicide. He's also been in and out of hospital and has needed support. The drug were a response to his mental health problems, he says, but only ""exacerbated it massively"". ""One of the things that shocked me since I stopped is not how much better I feel physically, but how much better I feel mentally,"" he says. West Yorkshire Police has a serious organised crime unit that it says proactively targets drug dealers ""on a daily basis"". ""The situation in Leeds is no different from any other city, where a minority of people very unwisely choose to put their health and wellbeing at risk by taking drugs,"" says Detective Inspector Phil Jackson. ""We have specialist officers who mount operations and painstakingly build up evidence on those involved, leading to convictions and lengthy prison terms, with a particular emphasis on so-called 'ring and bring' drug dealing phone lines. ""Alongside this work, officers from our local neighbourhood policing teams regularly act on community information about drug dealing and execute warrants to arrest and seize drugs on a daily basis. ""Educating young people around the dangers of drugs is also a key focus and we work closely with our partner agencies to that end.""

"Michel Barnier is the EU's chief negotiator for Brexit The UK cannot have the same trade deal with the EU as Canada, according to the bloc's chief negotiator. Michel Barnier said the EU was ready to offer an ""ambitious partnership"" with the UK post-Brexit, but its ""particular proximity"" meant it would be different. It comes after the UK's chief negotiator, David Frost, made a speech in Brussels calling for a ""Canada-Free Trade Agreement-type relationship"". The two sides are due to start negotiations next month. The UK left the EU on 31 January and is now in a transition period - following the majority of the bloc's rules - while a post-Brexit trade deal is hammered out. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has put a deadline of 31 December on agreeing a plan, saying he will not extend the transition period beyond then. Brexit negotiator: UK must be able to set own laws What does the UK sell to the rest of the world? What is a 'Canada-style' trade deal? On his first speech about the trade deal since his general election win, Mr Johnson said he wanted topursue a model similar to that of Canada's, which took seven years to negotiate. Under the agreement, import tariffs on most goods have been eliminated between the two countries, though there are still customs and VAT checks. This video can not be played PM: We want a Canada-style deal with the EU But speaking to reporters as he arrived at the European Parliament, Mr Barnier cast doubt on the possibility. ""We remain ready to offer the UK an ambitious partnership,"" he said. ""A trade agreement that includes in particular fishing and includes a level playing field, with a country that has a very particular proximity - a unique territorial and economic closeness - which is why it can't be compared to Canada or South Korea or Japan."" Mr Barnier said the EU remained ""ready to work very quickly with the UK"" on the basis of the agreement with Mr Johnson ahead of Brexit, adding: ""We remain ready to propose this partnership if the UK wants it."" This is all about what's known as the level playing field. The UK and the EU will become economic competitors, as well as partners, and level playing field rules are about how fair that competition is going to be. Almost all trade agreements include them to some degree, but the EU is demanding particularly strict rules because the UK is a major economy right on its doorstep - therefore a bigger potential competitor than a country like Canada. The EU wants a common set of rules on things like workers' rights, the environmental regulations that businesses have to follow, and, in particular, state aid (or support, including subsidies) for business. It says it will refuse to give British companies tariff-free access to its single market if those companies also have the ability to undercut their rivals based in the EU. But the British response, as articulated by David Frost on Thursday, is that the freedom to diverge from EU rules is the whole point of Brexit. We're going to have high standards, the UK insists, but they won't be your standards. The EU says a promise isn't good enough, and that's the argument we're going to see playing out over the coming months. Speaking in Brussels on Thursday, Mr Frost said the UK ""must have the ability to set laws that suit us"" and not be subject to rulings from European courts. He reiterated Mr Johnson's desire for a Canada-type agreement and said if it could not be agreed, the UK would trade on the basic international terms it currently follows with Australia. Mr Frost said the UK will set out more details of its vision for the future relationship with the EU next week.

"Doctors working on a clinical trial for treatment of heart disease held back key data, Newsnight has been told. The Excel trial tested whether stents were as effective as open heart surgery at treating patients with a heart problem called left main disease. The data suggested more people fitted with stents were dying after three years. It was eventually published - but only after treatment guidelines that partly relied on the trial had been written. These guidelines recommend both stents and heart surgery for certain patients with left main disease. The authors of the trial said it was carried out rigorously and to accepted academic standards. In the trial, sponsored by US stent manufacturer Abbott, half the patients were given stents, the other half had open heart surgery. Not all the patients were recruited at the same time. Some were recruited in 2011, others over the years that followed. So, when the first results were published in 2016, the doctors doing the trial knew there was data about what had happened to some of the patients five years after their stent or heart surgery procedure. But they chose to look only at what happened up to three years after the patients' procedures and publish that data. A spokesman for Abbott said: ""The study's execution, data collection, analysis and interpretation were entirely performed by independent research organisations. The publication of three-year Excel data reflects the original follow-up period and endpoints the study was powered to assess."" Prof Nick Freemantle, a biostatistician at University College London, said: ""If somebody had died three years and one day into the trial, that death wouldn't have been counted in the results. ""I'm absolutely appalled that they've done this,"" he said. ""I've taken a straw poll of my professional colleagues and it draws disbelief that people would do this,"" he said The researchers said the outcomes of the study were analysed and reported according to the protocol. Newsnight has seen information shared between people involved with the safety of the trial that suggested things were starting to look worse for people with stents after three years. More people were dying than those who had had surgery. Emails from the the trial's safety committee warned that all the data about deaths should be viewed by the researchers and published. ""It might be very concerning if in the future, suspicions were raised that already available information on mortality was withheld from the cardiology and thoracic surgery community,"" Dr Lars Wallentin, the head of the safety committee, wrote to the researchers in 2017. He was worried that major European clinical guidelines were being drawn up by heart doctors about how people with left main disease should be treated and the trial results would be used as part of their work. But the doctors on the trial chose not to publish the data when the safety committee asked, despite the warning. They published further data after the guidelines were completed. Even without this additional data, there was disagreement among those writing the guidelines about whether stents or surgery was the better treatment for patients. An external reviewer was brought in by the European Society of Cardiology to look at a number of trials and resolve the debate. Newsnight has seen the review. It said that the evidence suggested stents were worse than surgery for those with left main disease. ""I think most patients would find these differences to be clinically meaningful, I do not believe that both these procedures should receive the same class of recommendation,"" it said. But the review was not shared with everyone who believed they should have seen it. One of those people was Prof Freemantle, who was involved in the European guidelines. He claims that this calls into question the neutrality of the whole process. Stents are a less invasive option than open heart surgery Newsnight has previously reported that the same trial failed to publish certain heart attack data that cast stents in a bad light. The researchers said our leak data was fake and their methodology was the right one. Following Newsnight's previous report, a number of major surgical organisations have called for a review of the trial. The researchers carrying out the trial have agreed to an ""independent"" review of the raw data. Various names have been put forward by the researchers and the European Society of Cardiology about who is doing the analysis. All have ties to the researchers, guidelines process or medical device industry. When approached by the BBC they have all said they are not doing it. Prof John Ioannadis, from Stanford University, an expert on medical research design, said the analysis must be completely independent. ""I think that if you have the same network, the same closed club passing the data from one member to another, that's not really very helpful,"" he said. He believes the trial and guidelines process raise concerns which are indicative of a wider systemic problem with the way medical research is done. All the main doctors working on the trial, and the lead doctor writing the guidelines for left main disease, have declared financial contributions to either themselves or their institutions from companies that manufacture stents. ""You have the same people who run the show at all levels. They design the trials. They set the agenda, they choose what to present. ""They are involved in disseminating the information and running the large conferences that are attended by tens of thousands of people, specialists in the field. And then they also populate the guideline panels that reach the recommendations,"" he said. The organisations involved and researchers have declared the conflicts of interest, and say that they are effective in managing them. The conflict-of-interest declarations are intended to mitigate against conscious or unconscious bias - or the appearance of it. You can watch Newsnight on BBC Two at 22:30 on weekdays.

"Nicky Butt was accused of beating his estranged wife, Shelley Barlow Prosecutors have dropped an assault charge against ex-Manchester United footballer Nicky Butt. The 45-year-old wasaccused of beating his estranged wife Shelley Barlowin Hale, Greater Manchester, on 16 April. He was due to face trial next week but the case has been discontinued after the Crown Prosecution Service offered no evidence. He has accepted a caution. Ms Barlow did not want to give evidence against her husband, the Press Association reported. An investigation was launched after police were called to an address where they found a woman who had suffered a small cut to her hand. Mr Butt, who is head of coaching at the Manchester United youth academy, had previously pleaded not guilty to common assault and causing Â£800 of criminal damage to Ms Barlow's mobile phone. ""We have a duty to keep all cases under review and following the receipt of new material have decided to discontinue this prosecution,"" a spokesman said. ""Mr Butt has agreed to accept a caution for criminal damage."" At a previous hearing, Lisa Roberts QC, said it would be her client Mr Butt's case that he did not know how the complainant came about any injury. A preliminary hearing was due to take place on Wednesday in which his legal team was expected to argue the case should be thrown out as an abuse of process - partly questioning the proportionality of continuing with the prosecution. Mr Butt, from Bowdon, Altrincham, won a string of Premier League titles in his playing career at Old Trafford and also played in the club's dramatic last-gasp 2-1 victory over Bayern Munich in the 1999 Uefa Champions League final.

"Jake Paul has been heavily criticised after telling Twitter followers to ""remember anxiety is created by you"". His comments provoked a strong reaction online, where people suffering from anxiety condemned the ""dangerous"" advice. Others sarcastically thanked him for his suggestions. The YouTuber, who has close to 20 million subscribers on the video-sharing platform, subsequently deleted his tweet. ""Remember anxiety is created by you,"" Paul wrote. ""Sometimes you gotta let life play out and remind yourself to be happy and that the answers will come. ""Chill your mind out. Go for a walk. Talk to a friend."" The remarks triggered an immediate response. Thousands of social media users propelled Jake Paul, who has recently started selling subscriptions to a ""financial freedom movement"", into the top trending terms on Twitter. Allow Twitter content?

Frankie Bridge on mental health: 'I couldn't cope with everyday life' Is young people's mental health getting worse? Mental health at work: How it affected my first job This was what made ""flippant"" comments about anxiety so damaging, mental health campaigner and writer Lucy Nichol, who herself has an anxiety disorder, told BBC News. ""Because we can relate some day-to-day things to mental health conditions like anxiety, it's quite easy to be dismissive,"" she said. ""I've had years and years of therapy. I've been taking anti-depressants. I've had to take beta blockers when it's been really bad. ""One of my worst ever panic attacks occurred when I woke up at 03:00. Within about 30 seconds, I had a very bad panic attack. ""I thought I was going to die. It took about one and a half to two hours. It doesn't help to be told to chill out."" ""It's one of the stereotypes about anxiety that I detest. ""If someone experiences very severe anxiety and sees those sorts of comments, they might not seek help."" Anxiety can cause many different symptoms. It might affect how you feel physically, mentally and how you behave. And it is not always easy to recognise when anxiety is the reason you are feeling or acting differently. Source:NHS,external According to Anxiety UK, anxiety is one of the most prevalent mental health conditions in the UK - one in five people will experience an anxiety condition. ""Everyone regularly experiences anxiety to some degree,"" a representative said. ""When anxiety symptoms become too strong, however, a normal, natural response can develop into an anxiety condition or disorder. ""It is important not to generalise about support as there are many different avenues of support when it comes to anxiety, from self-help techniques and peer support to more professional services that can be accessed both through your GP and privately."" In a later tweet, Paul said he had also suffered from anxiety and had been ""spreading more awareness"". ""Everyone [is] clowning my tweet,""he wrote,external.

"Backpackers in Australia on working holiday visas may now be able to stay longer if they help out on farms that were affected by the bushfires. Previously, these visas let people work in the same place for six months - but that's just been upped to 12. Australia's acting minister for immigration says the new rules are about getting""as many boots on the ground as they need"",external. And the new rules have been introduced with immediate effect. ""These hard-working Australians have been hit by the recent bushfires, but from today they can employ backpackers for six months longer, helping them at a critical time in the recovery effort,"" said Alan Tudge in a statement. ""It means working holiday makers can help rebuild homes, fences and farms, they can get onto properties and help with demolition, land clearing, and repairing dams, roads and railways."" Australia often burns during its bushfire season, but its most recent summer was one of the most extreme ever. A state of emergency was declared in November 2019 and there was no substantial rain until February 2020, when fires in New South Wales were put out - but it also broughtfloods to some parts of Australia. The immigration minister's new rules will not only affect how long backpackers can stay in one place in their first year, it will also help them apply for a visa to spend a second year in Australia. Previously this only applied to people doing paid work in regional areas - which Mr Tudge estimates a third of backpackers in Australia already do. Fires in Australia caused devastation in rural communities He also told radio station 2GB thatconstruction work would now count towards backpackers extending their stay.,external ""They're very practical measures just to get more people on the ground right now, because we need all hands on deck,"" the minister said. He also added that getting more backpackers out to affected areas would bring benefits for wider communities, not just the farmers. ""It brings money into those local communities as well,"" he added. This video can not be played Carrots airdropped to wallabies caught in bushfires ""Backpackers tend to earn the money then go and spend it in a very short amount of time in those local areas as well so they're great for local communities on a number of fronts."" Australia's minister for trade, tourism and investment, Simon Birmingham, says that getting more holiday makers into these communities is essential to ""help protect local jobs and keep local businesses alive"". ""We know tourism businesses in fire-affected communities are doing it tough, and the more tourism dollars that these working holiday makers can inject into these economies, the quicker these businesses can get back on their feet,"" he says.

"The Boy Scouts of America has more than two million members The Boy Scouts of America (BSA) has filed for bankruptcy protection in a move that the group says will allow it to build a compensation fund for sex abuse victims. The move follows a number of lawsuits filed against the organisation over claims of sexual abuse, alleging it failed to prevent hundreds of cases. As a result of the move, all civil lawsuits against it are put on hold. The group is struggling with declining membership as well as abuse claims. ""The BSA cares deeply about all victims of abuse and sincerely apologises to anyone who was harmed during their time in scouting. We are outraged that there have been times when individuals took advantage of our programs to harm innocent children,"" chief executive Roger Mosby said in a statement. A wholesome US institution poisoned by predators Court papers filed in Delaware listed liabilities of up to $1bn (Â£768m) and assets of as much as $10bn, reports say. This video can not be played Boy Scouts of America: Why is it filing for bankruptcy? The filing was made under Chapter 11 of the US bankruptcy code which allows the group to keep operating and pay its creditors over time.

Boy Scouts accused of failing to prevent sex abuse Boy Scouts agree 'inclusive' name change Boy Scouts lift ban on gay leaders The group said it was setting up a trust fund to compensate victims. ""While we know nothing can undo the tragic abuse that victims suffered, we believe the Chapter 11 process - with the proposed trust structure - will provide equitable compensation to all victims while maintaining the BSA's important mission,""Mr Mosby said in a statement,external. The BSA has 261 councils which operate local troops and own assets including land in many states, the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reports. Tuesday's bankruptcy move is designed to protect those councils, which  hold about 70% of all BSA assets,according to the WSJ,external.

"Three men have been jailed after staging a violent raid on a house in Glasgow to steal eight puppies. Liam Kinsella, 27, Samuel Durnion, 21 and Ben Murphy, 19,smashed into the home of Leanne Hodge in Castlemilk last August. They held a machete against the throat of a 10-year-old girl inside the property  before stealing eight three-week old Bull Mastiff puppies. It is not known how many of the dogs, valued at Â£8,000, were returned. The three men were sentenced at the High Court in Glasgow after admitting acting with others in the assault and robbery. Kinsella was jailed for five years and three months while Durnion received a four year prison term. Murphy was sentenced to 30 months Lord Beckett described the raid as ""pre-meditated"" and said it has had a ""profound"" effect on Ms Hodge and others involved. Addressing Kinsella - who also admitted to a similar crime on an ex-boss - the judge said: ""It seems these attacks were carried out on your agenda against others you felt had harmed you and your family."" Durnion will also be supervised for a further two years on his release. The raid on Ms Hodge's home happened on 21 August last year while she was at home with her partner. Three children were also there. The Castlemilk robbery took place in Barlia Drive The robbers stormed in armed with machetes and hammers as a 10-year-old girl made her way downstairs. One of the armed men grabbed the girl and screamed at her, asking where her father was. As the family hid for their safety, the gang took the puppies. A high-profile appeal was later launched to try to find the robbers and the three-week-old pets. When police arrived they found keys belonging to a Volkswagen Polo the gang had driven there. They also recovered a number of items including a letter in the name of Murphy, and his passport. Kinsella was involved in an armed robbery five days earlier at the home of his former boss George Murray in Wishaw. David Nicolson, defending Murphy, said: ""He is a young man who was seduced by the excitement of being involved."" Durnion's advocate Louise Arrol said he was not the person who held the machete at the girl. Prosecutors told the hearing that the Crown ""does not appear to know the perpetrator of that particular act"".

"Mr Bloomberg is looking forward to taking part in the debate, his campaign manager said Democratic presidential candidate Michael Bloomberg will take part in a nomination debate for the first time on Wednesday, his campaign confirmed. In order to take part in the Nevada debate, he had to poll above double digits in four national polls recognised by the Democratic Party. On Tuesday, a NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll found he had support from 19% of those surveyed. The ex-New York Mayor is not competing in the first four nomination contests. Mr Bloomberg, 78, has instead chosen to enter the race on 3 March, known as Super Tuesday, when 14 states will vote. He came in second place in the NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll. Bernie Sanders came in first with 31% support nationally and Joe Biden was in third place with 15%. Meet the voters behind Bloomberg's surge Who is Michael Bloomberg? Can a billionaire win the Democratic race? ""Mike is looking forward to joining the other Democratic candidates on stage and making the case for why he's the best candidate to defeat Donald Trump and unite the country,"" Mr Bloomberg's campaign managerKevin Sheekey said in a statement,external.  31%for Bernie Sanders 19%for Michael Bloomberg 15%for Joe Biden 12%for Elizabeth Warren Billionaire businessman Mr Bloomberg has spent hundreds of millions of dollars on television, radio and digital advertising for his campaign. According to CNN,he has a campaign operation involving more than 2,000 aides,externalin New York and across the country. A 1990 booklet of quotes attributed to the billionaire has been released by the Washington Post newspaper. It includes sexist remarks, such as ""if women wanted to be appreciated for their brains, they'd go to the library instead of [luxury department store] Bloomingdale's"". He also reportedly told a pregnant employee she should ""kill it"", which he has denied under oath. In a recently leaked video clip, Mr Bloomberg appears to justify his controversial stop-and-frisk policy when he was New York mayor by saying ""you want to put those cops where the crime is, which mean in minority neighbourhoods"", before adding that 95% of murderers and murder victims are male minorities. He has apologised. During a 2016 talk, the former mayor suggested that farming and factory work required less ""gray matter"" than information technology jobs. ""I could teach anybody, even the people in this room, no offence intended, to be a farmer,"" Mr Bloomberg said. Vice-President Mike Pence appeared to hit back at the Democratic candidate on Sunday, posting a video with the speech ""So God Made a Farmer"", praising the industry. Mr Bloomberg has been accused by rival candidates Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders of trying to buy the election. He denies the claims and has offered to fund the Democratic effort to beat Republican President Donald Trump even if he does not win the nomination. During a Democratic dinner in Nevada on Saturday, Mr Sanders said: ""I got news for Mr Bloomberg, and that is the American people are sick and tired of billionaires buying elections."" During the debate Mr Bloomberg is expected to face tough questions over some of his policies as mayor. This video can not be played Bloomberg: ""We cannot afford four more years"" He was criticised over his support for the ""stop and frisk"" policy that saw a disproportionate number of black or Latino people questioned and searched by police officers. He has issued apologies, however Joe Biden has vowed to challenge him on the policy. Democratic candidate Amy Klobuchar said she thought Mr Bloomberg should be on the debate stage. She told NBC's Meet the Press: ""He can't hide behind the airwaves. He has to answer questions."" The Democratic 2020 race - in five charts A simple guide to US primaries and caucuses Michael Bloomberg's unprecedented advertising blitz has given him an unfiltered platform to advance his presidential candidacy. It's working out for him just fine so far. On Wednesday in Las Vegas, however, he's going to have to share the stage with his presidential rivals. He should expect a rough ride. It's hard to think of a Democratic opponent who wouldn't benefit from attacking the New York billionaire at this point. The moderates will need to take him down a peg if they hope to gain any footing in the more than a dozen states that hold primary contests in the weeks ahead. For Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, the two left-wing progressives, Bloomberg is the living embodiment of what they view as the corrosive influence big money has on American politics. Despite a slew of negative stories in the news lately, Mr Bloomberg has been riding a wave of near-nonstop media attention and surging poll numbers.

" You might call me an Amazon super-user. I’ve been a customer since 1999, and rely on it for everything from grass seed to birthday gifts. There are Echo speakers dotted throughout my home, Ring cameras inside and out, a Fire TV set-top box in the living room and an ageing Kindle e-reader by my bedside. I submitted a data subject access request, asking Amazon to disclose everything it knows about me Scanning through the hundreds of files I received in response, the level of detail is, in some cases, mind-bending. One database contains transcriptions of all 31,082 interactions my family has had with the virtual assistant Alexa. Audio clips of the recordings are also provided. The 48 requests to play Let It Go, flag my daughter’s infatuation with Disney’s Frozen. Other late-night music requests to the bedroom Echo, might provide a clue to a more adult activity. Clicking on another file reveals 2,670 product searches I had carried out within its store since 2017. There are more than 60 supplementary columns for each one, containing information such as what device I’d been using, how many items I subsequently clicked on, and a string of numbers that hint at my location. One spreadsheet actually triggers a warning message saying it is too big for my software to handle. It contains details of the 83,657 Kindle interactions I’ve had since 2018, including the exact time of day for each tap. An associated document divides up my reading sessions for each e-book, timing each to the millisecond. And on it goes. The endeavour was timed to coincide with a BBC Panorama documentary I’ve been involved with, which tracks Amazon’s rise through the prism of it being a data-collector. “They happen to sell products, but they are a data company,” says James Thomson, one of the former executives interviewed. “Each opportunity to interact with a customer is another opportunity to collect data.” Founder Jeff Bezos frames it in terms of being a “customer obsession”,saying the firm’s first priority is to“figure out what they want, what's important to them”. And he qualifies this by saying Amazon mustn’t violate people’s trust in the process. Yet as the company continues to grow, and expand into new activities, there are calls from both inside and outside Amazon to keep its data-feasting obsession in check.  Sleeping Lady resort is about a two-hour drive from Seattle. The name comes from the shape of the mountains that tower above its wooden cabins. When Bezos bussed Amazon’s staff there for a brainstorm in January 1997, it lived up to its Icicle Road address. A storm meant some missed the first evening’s events. But they’d all arrived when their leader began the next morning’s session, saying he wanted to create “a culture of metrics”. James Marcus was an in-house book reviewer at the time. “This mania for quantification was in Jeff’s heart,” he says. Marcus was grouped with Bezos at the event, as teams scribbled equations on white boards trying to invent ways to measure customer enjoyment. “Jeff’s algorithm wasn’t that much better than anybody’s algorithm that day,” he says. “But he understood that data was in fact very valuable. “The idea that every mouse click and every twist and turn through the website was itself a commodity, was a new sort of thinking for most of the employees - and for me too.” The next challenge was to decide what to sell beyond books. They picked CDs and DVDs. Over the years, electronics, toys and clothing followed, as did overseas expansion. And all this time, Amazon was building a battalion of data-mining experts. Artificial intelligence expert Andreas Weigend was one of the first. Before joining, he had published more than 100 scientific articles, co-founded one of the first music recommendation systems, and worked on an application to analyse online trades in real-time. Amazon made him its first chief scientist. “I had weekly meetings… with people, whoever wanted to stop by, where we just looked at clickstream histories in the evening, with beer and pizza, to wrap our brains around why would people actually do this, why on Earth would they click here,” he remembers. Clickstreams are the digital breadcrumb trail which Amazon follows to see which sites users come from, how they travel through its own pages and where they go to next. (Amazon’s response to my data request didn’t contain my own clickstream history, although the firm has providedsuch records to others in the past. A spokesman could not explain why.) A savvy ad-tech specialist was among Weigend’s recruits. David Selinger quickly climbed the ranks to lead the new Customer Behavior Research unit. Bezos, Weigend (centre) and Selinger (right). Weigend: ""I don’t know how that picture happened, I know that picture is in my bedroom in my bed at my home and nobody really is clear how Jeff Bezos got in my bed"" Bezos, Weigend (centre) and Selinger (right). Weigend: ""I don’t know how that picture happened, I know that picture is in my bedroom in my bed at my home and nobody really is clear how Jeff Bezos got in my bed"" “Our job was to build a customer-based dataset and then prove that there were opportunities, kind of fissures of gold,” Selinger says. Once a week they too delved into individuals' behaviour. “We had to make it actionable,” Selinger continues. “So to do that, we would project on the wall this view [of a] single customer and try to understand who she was. “What was unique about the internet and Amazon at the time was that we were able to take each individual customer and then change the experience.” Their work gave rise to personalisation and targeted recommendations, such as a customised front page for each user, and tailored emails in their inboxes. “I was shocked to see how predictable people are,” says Dr Weigend. “We didn’t think of it as exploiting, we thought about helping people make better decisions.” Weigend and Selinger moved on, but Amazon continued to hire talent to find innovative ways to turn data into dollars. Among them was ex-banker James Thomson. “I had worked for other companies where there was a so-called data warehouse,” says the former Amazon Services business chief. “But Amazon’s is literally the largest. “Amazon knows not just your preferences but the million other preferences of customers that look a lot like you. “So Amazon can basically anticipate what you’re going to need next - size up the inventory of which brands they are going to need in three to six months when you are ready to ‘unexpectedly’ buy those products.” It used to be exotic to talk of “big data”. These days the buzz phrase is “artificial intelligence”. However you frame it, Amazon leads the way in finding patterns in the noise of customer behaviour. But while this fuels its profits, it has also prompted concerns about the elevated positions Bezos and his deputies enjoy as a result. “We find ourselves being shot backward into a kind of feudal pattern where it was an elite, a priesthood, that had all the knowledge and all the rest of the people just kind of groped around in the dark,” says Shoshana Zuboff, a Harvard professor and author of The Age of Surveillance Capitalism. “This narrow priesthood of data scientists and their bosses sits at the pinnacle of a new society. “They are not beholden to us as customers, because in the surveillance capital model we are not customers, we are sources of raw material.” Amazon headquarters Amazon headquarters Not all of Amazon’s big decisions have been based on data. Sometimes Jeff Bezos simply goes with his gut. At the turn of the millennium, he wanted a logo revamp. The old logo showed the website’s address above a simple downturned swoosh. A package design agency pitched the idea of turning the curve upside down to form a smiling arrow pointing from A to Z. Bezos instantly loved it and rejected the need for consumer-testing. “Anyone who doesn’t like this logo doesn’t like puppies,” he said. Source:versionmuseum.com Source:versionmuseum.com The logo not only made Amazon seem friendly, but also highlighted its “everything store” ambitions. Trying to stock everything on its own was out of the question. So, instead it went into business with its competition. One after another, Amazon convinced bigger companies to outsource their e-retail operations to it. ToysRUs, Borders, Waterstones, Marks & Spencer and Target were among household names to sign up. The deals boosted everyone’s earnings in the short term, but Amazon was also making a longer-term play - it recognised the value of its partners’ data. John Rossman headed up the initiative for a time. “At that point people didn’t understand the potential for e-commerce and digital business, and they essentially just viewed it as, ‘Hey here’s additional revenue,’” he recalls. “They really gave away the keys to a kingdom.” Under a strategy named Launch and Learn, Amazon first partnered with rivals, then studied their sector’s value chain, and finally expanded onto their patch. It was years before the older firms realised the value of what they had given away. Some collapsed. Others extricated themselves in time but regretted their error. “They learned a tonne on our dime, and we didn’t learn much,”Target’s ex-chief strategy officer Carl Casey later complained. The other side to Amazon’s strategy was to convince smaller third-parties to sell new and used items via Marketplace - a platform which allowed their goods to be listed on the same pages as its own stock. It had a slow start, but became a massive success. “Third-party sellers are kicking our first-party butt,” the firmgleefully disclosed in its last annual report, referring to the fact that since 2015 independent sellers have accounted for the majority of physical goods sold via its site. Part of Marketplace’s success is down to Amazon’s willingness to share increasing amounts of analytics with the sellers. But only Amazon gets complete access. “Whether you're Target or another big retailer, or whether you’re a small entrepreneur who set up a third-party seller account, in all situations you’re basically renting the Amazon customer,” explains Thomson. “In the end, Amazon collects all that data - and it stays within the Amazon database.” For many merchants this is an acceptable trade-off. Lavinia Davolio says Amazon made it possible to sell her luxury Lavolio sweets across the world, as well as afford a London store. “The main benefit of the Amazon Marketplace is that my product suddenly is more visible to millions and millions of customers,” she says. But when pushed, she acknowledges: “We can’t really communicate directly to them - the customer stays with Amazon.” Most customers are probably happy that sellers can't bombard them with follow-up messages. However, when things go wrong, merchants can feel like they’ve little recourse. Roland Brana’s motorcycle clothing business boomed after he joined Amazon. After years of solid sales, it persuaded him to deepen their relationship and form a retail-manufacturer partnership. In simple terms, he would focus on supplying his Bikers Gear UK goods and Amazon would take care of the selling. Things started well, but then orders dried up. When Brana logged in, he saw something odd - Amazon’s site showed it had recently taken in new stock, but he had not supplied it. “This really sounded the alarm bells,” he remembers. So, he made a test purchase. And on ripping open Amazon’s cardboard packaging, his worst fears were confirmed. Within were biking clothes that resembled his designs, but with a different logo. They had been made by a factory he had previously used but ditched. He tried to resolve the case directly with Amazon to get sole control of the Bikers Gear product pages, including their user reviews. But he says he failed. And facing mounting debts, he decided to walk away. “Through my experience it felt like I was battling with the devil,” he comments. Panorama - Amazon: What They Know About Us Amazon says that “based on information we received it is our understanding that Mr Brana was a reseller of the products”. It says the difficulties in which he had found himself were the result of a dispute between him and his original manufacturer. Amazon’s UK chief Doug Gurr adds: “58% of all physical units that Amazon ships globally are from Marketplace sellers. “So what you can see is that hundreds and thousands of small entrepreneurial businesses and tens of thousands of small entrepreneurial British businesses have been able to find in some cases extraordinary success.” But the matter didn’t end there. A year and a half ago, investigators from the EU’s competition commission made a surprise call. “It was quite refreshing to finally have someone who was interested,” Brana says. In fact, he is just one of about 1,500 merchants Margrethe Vestager’s team of watchdogs has contacted. The European Commission has since launched a formal investigation. The Danish enforcer tells Panorama her focus is to decide whether Amazon is using its Marketplace data “in an unfair way”, particularly with regards to how it picks who gets featured in a page’s prominent “buy box” - a position Amazon often inhabits itself. “We would never accept in a football match that one team was also judging the game,” explains Vestager. “Amazon gets the details of all the retailers and all the shopping that takes place. What you look at, what you look at but don’t buy, what you look at next, how you pay, how you prefer your shipping. All of that rich data. “And you, as the individual retailer, you don’t.” The commission has the power to fine firms up to 10% of their annual global turnover - a potential $28bn penalty in this case - and demand changes. “Our approach is if Amazon is dominant in this market, they have this special responsibility not to misuse their power,” the commissioner adds. Jamie Siminoff knew the numbers didn’t add up. The inventor was on reality TV show Shark Tank to pitch DoorBot - a camera-enabled doorbell that let owners answer via their smartphone. “Think of it as caller-ID for your front door,” he said, triggering a laugh from one of the panel of potential investors. One by one the venture capitalists dropped out, until only one remained. He made an aggressive offer, asking for not just a stake, but also a share of sales. Siminoff declined. “It’ll bleed us of cash,” he said before exiting the stage. “I remember… literally being in tears - I needed the money,” he later remarked. It proved to be a wise calculation. Five years later Amazon swooped in and bought the business - now rebranded as Ring - for $839m (£643m). Ring is part of a wider push by Amazon into services. It also offers new ways to track people’s behaviour. Ring’s privacy notice statesthat personal information is used to “perform analytics including market and consumer research….[and to] operate, evaluate, develop, manage and improve our business,” via in-house tools as well as third-party services. (I asked Ring for my data to see exactly what this involves, but it has yet to provide it.) While much media coverage of Ring has centred on concerns it is helping the police to create a “surveillance state”, campaigners have recently turned their attention to the data it gathers about owners. “Even when this information is not misused and employed for precisely its stated purpose (in most cases marketing), this can lead to a whole host of social ills,” claims the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which carriedout a recent study. Ring counters that the data helps it to deliver better experiences. Those experiences will soon include Alexa. Later this year, the virtual assistant will be able to tell delivery drivers where to leave a package or take a message for the homeowner, if they do not reply themselves. And even smart devices that don’t have Alexa built in, can typically be controlled by it - and in turn provide Amazon with further details about users’ day-to-day activities. “It’s moving unbelievably quickly,” says Daniel Rausch, Amazon’s smart home vice president. “In just the first four months of [2019] we went from 30,000 to 60,000 devices that Alexa is compatible with.” He adds that privacy and security are “at the heart” of the initiative. For example, Alexa-enhanced devices light up to show when they are in listen mode. (It’s worth noting that my data request turned up about 1,400 recordings that appear to have been accidental activations.) Over time, Amazon has made it easier to review and delete voice histories. You can now also opt out of letting humans listen back and check recordings to improve the service. But Prof Zuboff raises concerns about whether people realise just how rich this new stream of data is. Some people use more than one platform, so the figures total more than 100% Some people use more than one platform, so the figures total more than 100% “From voice one can learn so many things about what a person cares about. What they’re thinking, how they’re engaging with their family, what their emotional state is,” says the psychologist. “There are also ways of breaking down and doing voice analysis, where you get things like cadence and pitch and all these other very fine-grained variables that give us insight into human emotion and sentiment. “These things are very highly predictive of future behaviour.” Amazon is open about the fact it is developing speech-emotion detection -and has even made some of its research public. But its scientists suggest much work still needs to be done before it can be deployed. Even so, sceptics say there’s a bigger point: consumers are scattering internet-connected microphones and cameras across their homes without necessarily thinking through the implications. “We all need private spaces where we’re not observed,” says venture capitalist Roger McNamee, who first met Bezos in the mid-90s when he sat in on a pitch Amazon’s leader made to a Silicon Valley fund. “Somewhere we can be our true selves without fear of being exposed or being exploited. “It is the business strategy of Amazon with Alexa, but also with Ring doorbells, to take these sanctuaries and convert them into public spaces. “People think: ‘Hey I give up a little personal data for a service I really like.’ “There was a time when that was [true]. But what’s going on now is much more invasive and much more manipulative.” Amazon, however, says this misrepresents its efforts. Devices chief Dave Limp says if it ever betrayed its customers, they could switch to a rival. Alexa might be the market leader, but it’s far from being the only AI on call. “We all have phones in and around us, and they can do all the [same] things,” he says. “They can wake up when you say their wake-words, they have cameras on them. So that world exists.” And he adds: “We don't collect data for data's sake.” “We would collect data on behalf of customers when we think we can invent something new for them or we can build a feature or service that benefits them in positive ways.”  Today, many of the data-interpreting techniques pioneered by Amazon have become commonplace. That’s in part because it built a business - Amazon Web Services - around selling them. It began as a small initiative to share know-how with other website operators. AWS’s first product manager, who had presented the idea to Amazon’s leaders, recalls that it nearly didn’t get off the ground. ""They thought it was giving away all of our intellectual property,” Robert Frederick says. “People were saying: 'No, no, let’s not do it.' “And [Jeff] said: ‘You know what? Let’s do it and let’s let them surprise us.’” Developers were soon asking AWS to offer them computing power and storage in addition to tools for specific tasks, so it expanded. Frederick likens this to providing the roads and electricity grid for a new country, saving individual enterprises the bother. “Other companies didn’t need to basically go through and recreate everything themselves,” he explains. The CIA and the UK’s Ministry of Justice are now among AWS’s many clients. So are some of Amazon’s biggest rivals, including Sainsbury’s, Apple, Netflix and the BBC. They trust the firm’s assurances that it can’t peek into their data. As a consequence, it’s now practically impossible to go about the day without enriching Amazon in some way. “I bet it’s not impossible,” jokes Matt Garman, one of AWS's current leaders. “You could probably live in a cave or something like that.” To stay ahead of its rivals, AWS continually rolls out new tools. One, a facial recognition service called Rekognition, has become deeply controversial because it has been promoted to law enforcers. It’s not clear how many are using it. But one Oregon-based Sheriff’s office confirmed it’s using the tool to match images obtained of suspects against those of 300,000 mug shots it holds. “Nobody will ever be arrested or detained simply based on a facial-recognition result,” one of its officers says. But civil right activists claim it could lead to wrongful arrests.  It’s proved so contentious that some of the tech firm’sown employees wrote Bezos a protest letter. “We know that [government] agencies surveil and monitor activists,” one told Panorama, asking to remain anonymous. “The wider deployment of facial recognition has a real potential to curb freedom of speech and erase civil liberties.” Amazon says it is mindful of such issues, and would support new regulations so long as they also apply to other providers. “We’ve never had any reported misuse of law enforcement using the facial-recognition technology,"" says AWS chief Andy Jassy. “Simply because the technology could be abused in some way, doesn’t mean that you should ban it. “We believe that governments and the organisations that are charged with keeping our communities safe, have to have access to the most sophisticated, modern technology that exists.” But one British watchdog fears where this could lead. “If the technology of reading people’s lips and understanding what people are saying becomes commonplace, what effect will that have on people?” asks Tony Porter, surveillance camera commissioner for England and Wales. “There are new technologies emerging that can perhaps monitor heartbeats. “It amounts to a very real power to understand, to surveil you in a way you’ve never been surveilled before.” “I want to leave you all with a little glimpse of Amazon’s future,” says Jeff Wilke. Dance music starts pounding through the vast room, cueing an unusually-shaped drone to rise from the stage. It’s the climax to Amazon’s consumer chief’s presentation at an AI-themed conference in Las Vegas. The aircraft’s wings double up as protective shrouds, he explains, so packages can still be transported in gusty conditions, and they also muffle its buzz. But a fortnight later there’s a twistwhen a patent emerges revealing the company has consideredusing its delivery-drones to offer add-on surveillance services, such as scanning properties from overhead to advise how they could be better protected from intruders. Amazon rarely lets a data-gathering opportunity go to waste. But the Prime Air initiative also underlines its willingness to make expensive long-term bets.  “We've had three big ideas,” Bezos once said. “Put the customer first. Invent. And be patient.” He arguably missed a fourth: Pay-offs should be gigantic. “Nobody wants to get involved - unless you’re going to create a multi-billion dollar business,” explains ex-insider James Thomson. “Multi-million dollar businesses are a dime a dozen.” While Amazon waits for its drones to take off, advertising is helping to drive its current growth. It was the fastest-growing segment on the firm’s latest balance sheet, and the company now ranks as the US’s third highest-earning digital ads player, behind Google and Facebook. Much of the action occurs on Amazon’s own website. It’s why when you search for a specific brand, rival products often take precedence on the results page. Referred to as ""sponsored items”, they sometimes crowd out the item you'd looked for unless its maker bid the most to stay on top. Companies also compete for places on rival products’ sales pages. Amazon claims its first priority is still to provide its customers with a useful and relevant experience. So, while it shares data about what keywords are most popular, it doesn’t reveal what individual users are looking for or any of their other personal details. But at least one ex-executive has doubts about the scale of the business. “It’s great to see the other big digital advertising platforms have some competition,” comments John Rossman. “But I do think there are fair questions about the balance. “The top of the list is always advertising-driven. It’s not truly like the highest-rated product or the product that serves my history the best.” There’s also been a backlash from smaller companies. They complain they must now pay to keep their products “above the scroll”. And that means either allowing their own profit to be squeezed, or passing on the extra cost to customers. US competition watchdogs are currently probing Amazon’s treatment of its smaller suppliers, and this could be a flashpoint. So, what’s next? Last year Amazon began a health insurance experiment, offering plans to its own workers and those of a bank via a joint venture called Haven Healthcare. It also acquired PillPack, an US online chemist, and trademarked Amazon Pharmacy in the UK and dozens of other countries. John Doerr - one of Amazon’s first investors - believes Bezos is laying the foundations for a new multi-billion dollar division. “Imagine what it’s going to be like when he rolls out Prime Health, which I’m convinced he will,”he told a Forbes Media conference. James Thomson worries how Amazon might use all that it knows to run this. He describes a message it might send a patient it already provides cholesterol medication to. “You weigh 225lbs, you have Lipitor prescription. “You buy exercise equipment that apparently you don’t use because you never replace it. “You don’t buy very many vegetables because we have all of your grocery shopping history. “We’ve got products for that.” And he predicts this would be a trigger point. “When those types of things start to happen, I believe it will become much more apparent that we have a major major data problem here,” he says. People love convenience and Amazon has prospered by obsessing about how to anticipate our wants before we’re even aware of them. So, society now has a choice: continue letting Amazon learn ever more about us in the name of better service, or consider forcing it to divide up its data - and maybe even itself - to prevent it knowing too much.

"HSBC has said it will axe around 35,000 jobs as it announced profits for 2019 fell by about a third. That has spurred the bank to target $4.5bn (Â£3.5bn) of cost cuts by 2022 as part of a major restructuring. The bank's interim chief executive, Noel Quinn, said HSBC would scale back its headcount from 235,000 to about 200,000 over the next three years. HSBC, which makes the bulk of its revenue in Asia, reported annual profit before tax of $13.35bn (Â£10.3bn). It said the fall in profits was mainly due to $7.3bn in write-offs related to its investment and commercial banking operations in Europe. The 35,000 job losses are deeper than expected, and represent about 15% of the workforce. Analysts had expected about 10,000 jobs to be cut. HSBC restructuring plans fuel fears of job cuts HSBC customers hit by two IT glitches within hours HSBC and Santander customers set for refund The bank currently operates in more than 50 countries across North America, Europe, the Middle East and Asia. It employs more than 40,000 people in the UK, where it has its headquarters. HSBC's global headquarters in Canary Wharf About 10,000 of those are based at its head office in Canary Wharf in London, and another 2,000 work at itsnew UK head officein Birmingham. HSBC has said some of the cutbacks will be in its European and US investment banking businesses, although it has not been specific about where the job cuts will fall. Set up in 1865 to facilitate trade between Asia and Europe, the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, to give it its full name, is moving back to its roots. With most of its profits coming from Asia - and with an expectation that the region is the best bet for long term prospects - the bank's cuts will focus on its European and US operations. At present the bank is not detailing exactly where the cuts will come, but the interim boss, Noel Quinn, says reducing the workforce from the current 235,000 to ""nearer 200,000"" would be consistent with the Â£3bn or so he wants to save by 2022. There are four key areas that are likely to be affected: the UK investment bank, the group's central operations, the US retail banking outfit and - as in many businesses - those areas where jobs are being replaced by technology. With one in seven jobs set to go globally, employees may face an anxious time - but with HSBC seeing a turnover of 25,000 staff per year, the compulsory cuts may not be quite as brutal as they sound. Peter Hahn, banking expert and former dean of the London Institute of Banking & Finance, told the BBC's Today programme: ""I think they were too optimistic about their chances of their success in investment banking. ""The reality is that the biggest investment market in the world is the US, and if you're not big in the US in investment banking it's pretty tough to succeed in that business - and they're not."" The strategy overhaul comes as economic growth is slowing in HSBC's major markets. Asia now accounts for about half of HSBC's revenue and 90% of profits. The bank is also facing the impact of the coronavirus, the UK's protracted withdrawal from the European Union and historically low interest rates around the world. It will be the UK-based bank's third overhaul in a decade as it attempts to lift its profits. Mr Quinn told Reuters that the restructuring would mean ""that our headcount is likely to go from 235,000 to closer to 200,000 over the next three years"". The 57-year-old HSBC veteran was appointed interim chief executive in August last year following the ousting of John Flint. HSBC reiterated that it expects to make a permanent appointment within the next six to 12 months. Addressing the impact of coronavirus, HSBC said the full effect had not been fully accounted for in its latest earnings, raising the possibility that it could increase the amount it expects the outbreak to cost the bank.

"Three men have been jailed after staging a violent raid on a house in Glasgow to steal eight puppies. Liam Kinsella, 27, Samuel Durnion, 21 and Ben Murphy, 19,smashed into the home of Leanne Hodge in Castlemilk last August. They held a machete against the throat of a 10-year-old girl inside the property  before stealing eight three-week old Bull Mastiff puppies. It is not known how many of the dogs, valued at Â£8,000, were returned. The three men were sentenced at the High Court in Glasgow after admitting acting with others in the assault and robbery. Kinsella was jailed for five years and three months while Durnion received a four year prison term. Murphy was sentenced to 30 months Lord Beckett described the raid as ""pre-meditated"" and said it has had a ""profound"" effect on Ms Hodge and others involved. Addressing Kinsella - who also admitted to a similar crime on an ex-boss - the judge said: ""It seems these attacks were carried out on your agenda against others you felt had harmed you and your family."" Durnion will also be supervised for a further two years on his release. The raid on Ms Hodge's home happened on 21 August last year while she was at home with her partner. Three children were also there. The Castlemilk robbery took place in Barlia Drive The robbers stormed in armed with machetes and hammers as a 10-year-old girl made her way downstairs. One of the armed men grabbed the girl and screamed at her, asking where her father was. As the family hid for their safety, the gang took the puppies. A high-profile appeal was later launched to try to find the robbers and the three-week-old pets. When police arrived they found keys belonging to a Volkswagen Polo the gang had driven there. They also recovered a number of items including a letter in the name of Murphy, and his passport. Kinsella was involved in an armed robbery five days earlier at the home of his former boss George Murray in Wishaw. David Nicolson, defending Murphy, said: ""He is a young man who was seduced by the excitement of being involved."" Durnion's advocate Louise Arrol said he was not the person who held the machete at the girl. Prosecutors told the hearing that the Crown ""does not appear to know the perpetrator of that particular act"".

"Dr Peter Hutchinson stopped teaching after an internal investigation in 2015 A Cambridge University academic who was accused of sexual harassment published erotic fiction about students the year complaints were made against him. Dr Peter Hutchinson quit teaching at Trinity Hall in 2015 following an internal investigation into his conduct. It has now emerged he self-published a raunchy book centred around a university in the same year. The don said the book offered a ""progressive"" view of women. Dr Hutchinson, a former lecturer in modern and medieval languages, had agreed to stop teaching and attending social events in 2015 after facing complaints of ""inappropriate"" comments from 10 students. But last year the BBC discoveredhe had retained some college privileges. He then resigned in Novemberafter more than 1,300 students and alumni signed an open letter protesting that he had been allowed to keep his post. Now,following an investigation by Tortoise,external, it has emerged that he published an erotic novel under a pseudonym at the time of the 2015 complaints. Dr Hutchinson has confirmed he is the author of ""First Time: Ooo-la-la!"", which was published under the name ""Barry Able"". The books tells the story of an ""innocent"" first year student called Peter at a fictitious Oxford college who is found guilty of alleged sexual impropriety after a ""series of erotic adventures"". Most of the women students in the book are members of a college sex club called ""The Virgins"" and must sleep with a man - or senior academic - each week to remain in the group. In the opening of the text, a female student is called a ""brazen hussy"" and others are described as being ""well endowed"" in lingerie, suspenders and garter-belts. It also contains references to bondage, voyeurism and public humiliation. Cambridge academic resigns after harassment row Cambridge don readmitted after sexual harassment Ex-uni fellow leaves after sexism apology The front-cover features an image of a woman's leg in stockings, which Dr Hutchinson confirmed belonged to a former Trinity Hall student. Dr Hutchinson said that he did not ""see a problem using an unidentifiable photo"" of a student, adding he was not present when it was taken. Sophie Newbery, 23, who graduated in German and Russian from Trinity Hall in 2018, said she was ""disgusted"" and ""uncomfortable"" by its contents. Sophie Newbery - one of Dr Hutchinson's former students - says she was ""disgusted"" by his book In 2015, she was one of 10 students who complained that Dr Hutchinson had asked them during a seminar if they had ""ever had any love bites"" and, while discussing the subject of a dominatrix in a book, asked a female student: ""Does that turn you on?"". Dr Hutchinson said his book had a ""progressive view of women"" who were ""totally liberated"". Dr Peter Hutchinson was cleared of criminal charges of sexual assault in 2006 after a complaint brought by an ex-student. The book echoes parts of the court case and gives a fictionalised account of the encounter. Ellie Pyemont, now 38, who brought the case, told the BBC she ""recognised"" herself in the pages. ""It is pathetic that he wrote and self-published this misogynistic, crass and deluded story,"" she said. ""The significant point is that the person behind this derisory book was in a position of power over young people at Trinity Hall for decades."" Ellie Pyemont says the erotica was ""misogynistic, crass and deluded"" Dr Hutchinson said it was unlikely Trinity Hall was aware of the book and that its publication had nothing to do with the college. He said the ""recasting is so broad that it bears no relation to real life"". ""It needs to be emphasised that an author rarely thinks the same way as his main character,"" he said.

"New HIV tests that provide results in minutes have been introduced in Glasgow to help tackle the worst outbreak of the infection in decades. Drug users sharing needles are in the group most affected bythe surge of HIV cases in Scotland's biggest city. Previously, test results could take up to two weeks to come back from the laboratory and it could be difficult to trace people to tell them the outcome. The finger-prick blood tests will be available at needle exchanges. About 170 people in Glasgow are believed to have contracted HIV in the current outbreak, but it is feared the actual number may be much higher as many drug users do not engage with needle exchange services. Experts say with each new case of HIV the potential for harm grows because of the vulnerable nature of those involved, many of whom are homeless. John Campbell, of the Glasgow City Health and Social Care Partnership, said getting results in minutes means those with positive results ""can link into treatment instantly"" while those who do not have the infection can be given harm-reduction advice. He said: ""Undoubtedly, the current HIV outbreak is due to people sharing drug-taking equipment. ""Currently, people are injecting outdoors in filthy, sometimes urine-soaked alleyways or on derelict ground. ""Glasgow has some of the best needle exchange services in the world but it is very hard for us to influence people's injecting behaviour unless professionals are present when they inject.""

More than 5,000 people are living with HIV in Scotland and modern antiretroviral drugs mean those with the condition can live long and healthy lives. Rapid HIV tests were first piloted in Glasgow by the Waverley Care charity, but the latest initiative will significantly increase their availability. Nathan Sparling, chief executive of HIV Scotland, believes it will allow people to receive treatment more quickly. He told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme: ""For this particular population, who might not come back into services for a couple of weeks or might be moving around, some people just weren't getting their results. ""Now, these tests mean we can get people into treatment so that they can become undetectable and live well with HIV and not pass it on sexually."" Later this month, two summits to discussScotland's record drug death ratewill take place in Glasgow. The city in the eye of an HIV 'perfect storm' What can be done to halt Glasgow's HIV epidemic? More than 5,000 Scots living with HIV virus Many of the drugs workers and medical staff who try to treat the HIV positive population in Glasgow favour the idea of a drug consumption room - or safe injecting facility. Glasgow City Council and GCHSCP want to open an indoor location where drug users can consume drugs they have bought on the streets in a safe and clean environment. They have the support of the Scottish government but drug laws are reserved to Westminster and a UK government spokeswoman confirmed it has no plans to introduce such centres. But the spokeswoman said discussions on how it can ""most effectively prevent the health-related harms of drugs misuse"" will take place at the drugs summit it is holding in Glasgow on 27 February, a day after a Scottish government summit on the same issue.

"Milly Main died after contracting an infection at the Royal Hospital for Children The death of a child who contracted an infection at Glasgow's super-hospital has been referred to prosecutors. NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde (NHSGGC) confirmed it had passed details of its investigation into the death of Milly Main to the procurator fiscal. The 10-year-old died in August 2017 after treatment for leukaemia at the Royal Hospital for Children (RHC). NHSGGC said it was ""appropriate"" to refer the case due to concerns from her family and public interest in her case. However, Labour MSP Anas Sarwar has described it as ""a cynical attempt"" by the health board to look like it is being proactive. Hospital infection spiked at time of child's death 'Milly would be here' had Glasgow hospital followed advice 'I was let down and lied to over Milly's death' Milly Main had a successful stem cell transplant in July 2017 while she was in remission from leukaemia. She was making a good recovery when the following month her Hickman line, a catheter used to administer drugs, became infected. Stenotrophomonas maltophilia was listed on Milly's death certificate Milly went into toxic shock and died days later. Her death certificate lists a Stenotrophomonas infection of the Hickman line among the possible causes of death. Milly's mother, Kimberly Darroch, has said the family werekept in the dark about a potential linkto contaminated water problems at the hospital. NHSGCC maintains that there has been no link established between the water in the hospital and the patient's death. Mr Sarwar has been supporting the Lanark family since late last year when a whistleblower came forward to reveal the scale of infections linked to the water supply, and it emerged that Milly was one of the patients involved. Ms Darroch and Milly's father Neil Main recently instructed solicitors to send a letter to the Lord Advocate following the revelations about infections linked to the water supply at the hospitals. Anas Sarwar with Milly Main's mother Kimberly Darroch who have called for a fatal accident inquiry According to Mr Sarwar, that letter, which called for a fatal accident inquiry, also acted as a referral of the death to the procurator fiscal, as it was not reported by the health board at the time. NHSGGC has now separately written to Milly's parents, stating that it has since referred the death, citing the public interest. A spokesman for the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal service confirmed that it had received a final report from NHSGGC within the last week. Mr Sarwar said: ""Milly's death should have been reported to the procurator fiscal at the time. ""The way her family has been treated is disgraceful. They were kept in the dark for years and shown no respect by the health board when a brave whistleblower shone a light on the QEUH infection scandal. ""At all times, the health board's priority has been about saving its own skin, not doing what was right by Milly's parents."" The Royal Hospital for Children is next door to the QEUH He added: ""The health board has now decided to refer the case to the procurator fiscal in the knowledge that Milly's parents did so weeks ago. It is a cynical attempt to look like it is being proactive when it has been deliberately evasive up until now."" Mr Sarwar said he believed the Lord Advocate would listen to Milly's parents' demand for a fatal accident inquiry. He said: ""This is a painful experience for Milly's family. It is forcing them to relive her death all over again, nearly three years after her tragic death.Â ""I will not stop until there is justice for Milly's parents, and they receive the answers they deserve."" A spokeswoman for NHSGCC told the BBC that the board was in contact with the procurator fiscal from as early as 19 November last year to discuss the case, following media reporting.Â She said: ""The death of any child is a tragedy and we continue to offer our sympathies to Milly's family for their loss. ""Following recent concerns from Milly's family, the public interest in her death, and discussions with the Cabinet Secretary for Health, we sought advice from the Procurator Fiscal.  Following this advice it was deemed appropriate to refer Milly's case to the Procurator Fiscal which we have now done."" The spokeswoman said that Milly's case was also being considered as part of the review of patient episodes that Professor Marion Bain, director of infection prevention and control, would be overseeing, with the involvement of Milly's family ""in whatever way they wish"".

"Kara said she ""couldn't deal with the thought of further masculisation"" Transgender patients are choosing to self-medicate with hormones bought online from unregulated sources due to waiting times to see NHS specialists, the BBC has learned. In many areas, some patients wait over two years to be seen, new figures show. England's target time is 18 weeks. One woman said she was so low it felt like a choice between self-medicating or suicide. NHS England said it had increased investment to respond to rising demand. Law student Kara told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme she began buying oestrogen - the hormone prescribed to trans women - last summer online, to begin her transition. She has been on an NHS gender identity clinic waiting list now for two years. She admitted she was ""absolutely petrified"" of the effects it could have on her. Many of the websites selling hormones are not based in the UK - and often ask users to pay by Bitcoin or bank transfer. ""I don't know anything about the tablets [that I buy] specifically, if they are what they say they are,"" she said. ""So it's kind of a guessing game with your life."" She told the BBC she felt the waiting times had ""forced"" her to make the choice to buy hormones online. ""I was so low before, it basically felt like a choice between suicide or self-medicating, because I couldn't deal with the thought of further masculisation,"" she added. Dr Grainne Coakley said those who were self-medicating, were putting themselves at risk One expert, Dr Grainne Coakley, from Sheffield's Gender Identity Clinic, said - with both testosterone and oestrogen tablets - there was an added risk of the clotting of the blood, and also a risk of liver problems. ""If that's not being monitored by a GP, somebody not having regular blood tests, then they are putting themselves at risk."" New figures, from a Freedom of Information request by the Victoria Derbyshire programme, show that in many areas some individuals are waiting over two years to be seen by a specialist, from referral. Gender identity clinics in Belfast (166 weeks), Nottinghamshire (145 weeks) and Northumberland (127 weeks) have the longest maximum wait times, data suggests. NHS Highland's gender identity clinic (32 weeks) has the shortest maximum wait. London's Tavistock clinic was not able to provide accurate figures, but anecdotal evidence points to patients waiting up to two years to be seen. More than 13,500 transgender and non-binary adults are on waiting lists for NHS gender identity clinics in England,previous BBC research has found. The Victoria Derbyshire programme bought four testosterone and oestrogen products online, to send to a laboratory for testing. Only three arrived. One, a testosterone sample, was supposed to be made up of four different types of the drug - but this was not the case, indicating it was a counterfeit product from an unknown source. Supplying or selling testosterone, a class C drug, is punishable by an unlimited fine or up to 14 years in jail. But it is not illegal to buy or possess it for personal use, provided it is not brought into the country via the postal system. Oestrogen is a prescription-only product, but if it is for personal use it can be legally imported without a prescription. In both cases experts stress it is only safe to use prescribed drugs, under the ongoing supervision of a medical expert. Lucas, who began transitioning six years ago aged 29, decided to use testosterone bought online after being told he would face a two-and-a-half year wait for a gender identity clinic appointment. He said he knows of at least one person who has taken their own life due to the ""distressing and dehumanising"" wait to be seen. Lucas described self-medicating as ""scary and unpleasant"", and believes the quality of the products was notably lower than those he is now prescribed. ""I suspect a few of the doses were effectively nothing, ""For example, I didn't actually start growing any facial hair at all until I moved onto prescribed testosterone."" NHS England told the BBC in a statement:  ""As more people feel able to seek support and treatment, the demand for gender identity services has greatly increased, and in recent years we've increased investment to respond to the rising demand, with staff working hard to support patients to get the right care as quickly as possible. ""From the spring a new service will be piloted in London that will increase capacity in gender identity services."" It is understood that a lack of medical professionals wanting to specialise in trans healthcare had also added to wait times, for which a new Royal College of Physicians pathway had been established. A Scottish government spokesman said long waiting times for patients were ""unacceptable"", but that health professionals were working hard to reduce them. He added: ""Gender identity clinics are a very specialised resource, and while people are waiting to be assessed they still have access to a full range of community mental health and well-being services appropriate to their situation and needs.""

"The Scottish Police Authority said the deficit of Â£49m will create huge challenges for the force Police Scotland is facing an ""unsustainable"" financial deficit, despite receiving more money than expected in this month's budget. TheScottish budgetallocated an extra Â£37m to the force, almost double what it had expected. But the Scottish Police Authority (SPA) said that still leaves an unsustainable deficit of Â£49m. The concerns are detailed in a paper, which will be discussed at an SPA meeting in Stirling on Wednesday. Reducing police officer numbers, which has been discussed, might help cut costs. But vice-chairman David Crichton said the cash allocated for capital programmes - IT, vehicles and buildings - is not enough to provide investment to achieve efficiencies. He calls for new approaches to non-police work, such as officers helping people in mental health distress, to help maintain core services. Mr Crichton paper's,published ahead of the meeting,external, states: ""Having focused on the budget challenge at our last authority meeting, I do want to acknowledge a settlement that is better than might have been expected. ""However, we still have a responsibility to report that the policing budget remains in deficit and that this is unsustainable going forward. ""Neither the reduction in officer numbers nor the increased funding required to eliminate the deficit will be acceptable or practicable in the short to medium-term. ""The authority will therefore continue to pursue and advocate for changes that enable the deficit to be reduced."" The report states the service needs to see ""faster and more effective transformational change, more robust demand and productivity analysis and detailed workforce planning"". Mr Crichton acknowledged the force has already achieved a great deal in delivering savings and efficiencies but stressed it will be a ""constant process"". He added: ""The anticipated capital allocation, while welcome, will not support the full scope of new investment required to achieve greater efficiencies and improved services. ""And across the wider public service system the level of failure demand which ultimately falls on police officers to resolve, for example in supporting individuals in mental health distress, will continue to draw on resources unless more creative approaches to funding and partnership working across all services are developed. ""These challenges will continue to drive much of the authority's priorities."" Last month, Nicola Sturgeon and Scottish Conservatives leader Jackson Carlawclashed over police fundingat First Minister's Questions. The meeting will also discuss the cost ofpolicing the UN climate change conferencein Glasgow in November, which has now been estimated at Â£250m.

"The number of health and safety incidents reported at Amazon warehouses is on the rise Hundreds of workers have been seriously injured or narrowly escaped an accident at Amazon's UK warehouses over the last three years, new figures claim. GMB union numbers show 240 reports of serious injury or near misses were sent to the Health and Safety Executive last year, and 622 over three years. Amazon is currently running a TV advertising campaign highlighting contented staff. It said critics were determined to present a ""false picture"". The GMB obtained the figures via Freedom of Information requests. For injuries to be included in the figures they need to be serious enough to stop a worker performing their normal duties for at least seven days, or be on a list including fractures, amputation, crushing, scalping or burning. In one London warehouse a worker lost consciousness and appeared to stop breathing after injuring their head, the GMB said. In Manchester, one worker got caught in a gate and fractured their hand. The data shows the number of reports to the HSE has increased every year, from 152 in the 2017 financial year to 240 in 2019. However the figures deal with a period during which the number of warehouses run by Amazon more than doubled from 10 in 2015 to 22 today. Jeff Bezos pledges $10bn to fight climate change Amazon to create 1,000 jobs at new warehouse Mick Rix, GMB national officer, said: ""Amazon are spending millions on PR campaigns trying to persuade people its warehouses are great places to work. But the facts are there for all to see - things are getting worse. ""Hundreds of stricken Amazon workers are needing urgent medical attention. Conditions are hellish. We've tried over and over again to get Amazon to talk to us to try and improve safety for workers. But enough is enough - it's now time for a full parliamentary inquiry."" In December, GMB and the Trades Union Congress (TUC) were joined by members of the shadow cabinet for a demonstration outside Amazon's London offices. The unions and politicians said that Amazon should be paying millions more in taxes, claims denied by the online giant. A spokesman for Amazon said: ""Amazon is a safe place to work. Yet again, our critics seem determined to paint a false picture of what it's like to work for Amazon. They repeat the same sensationalised allegations time and time again. ""Our doors are open to the public, to politicians, and indeed to anyone who truly wants to see the modern, innovate and, most importantly, safe environment we provide to our people.""

"Average weekly wages in the UK have reached their highest levels since before the financial crisis. Weekly pay reached Â£512 in the three months to December, which - adjusting for inflation - is the highest since March 2008. Excluding bonuses, earnings grew at an annual rate of 3.2% in the three-month period,official figures show.,external Employment rose by 180,000 to another record high of 32.93 million, while unemployment stayed at 1.29 million. The figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed the number of women in employment increased again - this time by 150,000 in the three months to December to a record high of 15.61 million. Myrto Miltiadou, of the ONS, said: ""In real terms, regular earnings have finally risen above the level seen in early 2008, but pay including bonuses is still below its pre-downturn peak. ""Employment has continued its upward trend, with the rate nudging up to another record high. In particular, the number of women working full-time grew strongly over the past year."" HSBC signals mass job cuts as profits plunge Inflation at lowest for more than three years Employment Minister Mims Davies said: ""As we embark on a new chapter as an independent nation outside the EU, we do so with a record-breaking jobs market and business confidence on the rise. ""With wages still outpacing inflation, UK workers can expect their money to go further as we look ahead to a decade of renewal."" It's always good to have some cheerful news to report, such as the news that wages, after stripping out the effect of inflation, have finally squeaked above their level in March 2008. In other words, your wage can finally buy a little bit more than it could before the banking crisis. So let's celebrate. Hooray. Now let's home in on the amounts. The average wage excluding bonuses is now Â£511.61. In March 2008, the average wage would have bought you Â£510.96 (in 2019 prices). In other words you are 65p better off than you were - 12 years ago. There's always a half-full or a half-empty angle on wage increases. But to many workers, this minor economic landmark will serve less as a cause for celebration and more as a reminder that the past decade has been the worst for improvements in living standards in more than 200 years. The 2008 crisis, caused in part by reckless mismanagement of the banks, is one reason (not the only one) that the average pay packet has failed to do what we used to take for granted - i.e. increase by more than inflation. It used to happen every year. Low-pay think tank the Resolution Foundation points out that if pre-crisis trends for increases in pay in real terms had continued, the average wage would now be Â£141 a week higher. Thomas Pugh, at Capital Economics, said the employment figures proved the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC)was right to leave interest rates unchanged last month. ""The most recent surveys are suggesting that employment growth will continue to pick-up in Q1, which we think will contribute to the MPC keeping rates on hold at its next meeting on 26 March as well,"" he said. However, the Institute of Directors warned: ""The UK jobs market ended last year in fine form, but 2020 may be more challenging for employers. ""As more and more workers enter employment, it becomes harder for firms to recruit the employees they need, with a particular dearth in certain skill sets."" And Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. said: ""The upside surprise to employment growth distracts from an otherwise slightly disappointing report. ""Despite the recovery in business confidence since the general election, the single-month measure of job vacancies was 49,000, or 6%, lower in January than a year earlier, showing no improvement from its recent trend.""

"David Frost set out the UK's stance ahead of post-Brexit trade talks The UK ""must have the ability to set laws that suit us,"" the PM's chief Brexit negotiator has said in a speech in Brussels. David Frost has set out the UK's stance ahead of post-Brexit trade negotiations, due to start next month. He dismissed the idea an EU court would have a role in future trade disputes, saying: ""We only want what other independent countries have."" It comes as France warns Britain to expect a bruising battle during talks. Acting Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey said: ""Boris Johnson should listen to the views of British businesses who want to maintain the closest possible alignment with the European Union."" France warns UK of bitter post-Brexit trade talks What does the UK sell to the rest of the world? What happens after Brexit? What is the transition period? Addressing students and academics at the UniversitÃ© libre de Bruxelles, Mr Frost said: ""It is central to our vision that we must have the ability to set laws that suit us - to claim the right that every other non-EU country in the world has. ""So to think that we might accept EU supervision on so-called level playing field issues simply fails to see the point of what we are doing."" He said this was not a ""a simple negotiating position which might move under pressure - it is the point of the whole project"". The UK wants aCanada-type free trade agreementwith the EU, Mr Frost said. If this cannot be agreed, then Britain will trade on the basic international terms it currently follows with Australia. He said the UK will set out more details of its vision for the future relationship with the EU next week. Mr Frost also reiterated the government's insistence that it will not extend the transition period beyond the end of this year. The transition period runs until 31 December 2020, during which time the UK continues follow EU rules - including freedom of movement. It is intended to allow time for the UK and the EU to agree a post-Brexit trade agreement. What is a level playing field? Brexit: Will it be a Canadian or an Australian ending? Britain 'will not be aligning with EU rules' - Raab One of the key sticking points could be the idea of ensuring a level playing field - which was referred to by Mr Frost in his speech. The EU wants the UK to sign up to strict rules on fair and open competition - known as level-playing-field guarantees - so if British companies are given tariff-free access to the EU market, they cannot undercut their rivals. The EU has repeatedly warned that the UK cannot expect to enjoy continued ""high-quality"" market access if it insists on diverging from EU social and environmental standards. It also wants the European Court of Justice to have a legal role in policing any free trade agreement reached. But in his speech, Mr Frost asked: ""How would you feel if the UK demanded that, to protect ourselves, the EU dynamically harmonise with our national laws set in Westminster and the decisions of our own regulators and courts? ""The more thoughtful would say that such an approach would compromise the EU's sovereign legal order."" This was a rare public appearance by the man who'll run Boris Johnson's negotiations with the EU. David Frost told the audience at a university in Brussels that the whole point of the UK's departure was so it could set its own laws for its own benefit. And that's why Britain couldn't accept the continued application of European rules or the involvement of Brussels in competition policy as the conditions for an ambitious free trade agreement. The question is whether that can be reconciled with the EU's position that it has to apply more stringent safeguards to its neighbour than it does to Canada, Japan or South Korea. This carefully controlled event in front of some students, a few diplomats and a lot fewer journalists was designed to show the post-Brexit politics of Britain, not to spell out the government's opening negotiating position in detail. That'll come next week, when the EU is expected to do the same. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has previously cast doubt on Boris Johnson's aim to reach a comprehensive agreement by the end of the year Speaking on Sunday, French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian predicted the two sides would ""rip each other apart"" as they strove for advantage in the negotiations. ""But that is part of negotiations, everyone will defend their own interests,"" he added. He also said it would be tough for the UK to achieve its aim of agreeing a free trade deal by the end of the year. Speaking at a security conference in Munich, Mr Le Drian said the two sides were far apart on a range of issues.

"Most clubs in the top two tiers of English football are sponsored by gambling companies Former FA chief executive Mark Palios says football needs to ""wean"" itself off gambling sponsorship. He toldBBC Radio 4's File on 4programme football's links with the betting industry had gone ""too far"". Mr Palios, who chairs Tranmere Rovers FC, said he would not accept gambling sponsorship and had rejected an offer from a major betting company last year. The English Football League said football and the gambling industry worked together responsibly. A spokesman said: ""The EFL itself continues to have a successful relationship with Sky Bet who, as a responsible, properly regulated bookmaker, recognise the importance of having the right safeguards in place. "" Any marketing of the partnership promoted best practice and protected minors and the vulnerable, he added. The Premier League said it did not have a central gambling partner and sponsorship deals were up to individual clubs. In the top two tiers of English football, nearly 60% of clubs are signed up to sponsorship agreements with gambling companies. Mr Palios has helped a number of players with gambling problems Mr Palios said the offer he had rejected had included a plan to place betting terminals inside the ground. ""This is a family club that's firmly rooted in the community and from our perspective it's the wrong thing to do to get associated with the gambling industry,"" he said. ""We can't change the bigger picture in terms of the football industry being involved to the extent it is but from a personal perspective that's what we do. ""Football has to wean itself off the position it is in at the moment - and that's the best verb I can use. ""It's certainly gone too far."" Mr Palios played as a midfielder for Tranmere Rovers for nine years and Crewe Alexandra for three years. He was made chief executive of the Football Association in July 2003. But he resigned in August 2004, following newspaper allegations concerning the then England coach Sven-Goran Eriksson's affair with former FA secretary Faria Alam. Ten years later, he took a controlling interest in Tranmere Rovers and became chief executive. Mr Palios also revealed an employee had stolen from the club to feed their gambling addiction and he had helped a number of players there with gambling problems. He said the demographic of a football club was ""particularly appealing"" to gambling operators. Mr Palios also highlighted a report suggesting most of the betting shops in Wirral - where EFL League One team Tranmere are based - were in the poorest areas, where people spent more than twice as much on gambling as those in the richest areas. ""I see gambling as something that is pernicious. People get hooked into it and it is a hidden addiction,"" he said. ""You see people stealing from their employers as we've seen and it destroys relationships and fundamentally damages family units and family units are a massive part of the community."" The Betting and Gaming Council, which represents most bookmakers in the UK, said it was ""considering"" a voluntary ban on football shirt sponsorship and pitch-side advertising. And last month, the Gambling Commission, the industry regulator, said it was investigating a deal in which FA Cup matches had been shown live via seven betting sites if potential customers had signed up for an account.

"The Scottish Police Authority said the deficit of Â£49m will create huge challenges for the force Police Scotland is facing an ""unsustainable"" financial deficit, despite receiving more money than expected in this month's budget. TheScottish budgetallocated an extra Â£37m to the force, almost double what it had expected. But the Scottish Police Authority (SPA) said that still leaves an unsustainable deficit of Â£49m. The concerns are detailed in a paper, which will be discussed at an SPA meeting in Stirling on Wednesday. Reducing police officer numbers, which has been discussed, might help cut costs. But vice-chairman David Crichton said the cash allocated for capital programmes - IT, vehicles and buildings - is not enough to provide investment to achieve efficiencies. He calls for new approaches to non-police work, such as officers helping people in mental health distress, to help maintain core services. Mr Crichton paper's,published ahead of the meeting,external, states: ""Having focused on the budget challenge at our last authority meeting, I do want to acknowledge a settlement that is better than might have been expected. ""However, we still have a responsibility to report that the policing budget remains in deficit and that this is unsustainable going forward. ""Neither the reduction in officer numbers nor the increased funding required to eliminate the deficit will be acceptable or practicable in the short to medium-term. ""The authority will therefore continue to pursue and advocate for changes that enable the deficit to be reduced."" The report states the service needs to see ""faster and more effective transformational change, more robust demand and productivity analysis and detailed workforce planning"". Mr Crichton acknowledged the force has already achieved a great deal in delivering savings and efficiencies but stressed it will be a ""constant process"". He added: ""The anticipated capital allocation, while welcome, will not support the full scope of new investment required to achieve greater efficiencies and improved services. ""And across the wider public service system the level of failure demand which ultimately falls on police officers to resolve, for example in supporting individuals in mental health distress, will continue to draw on resources unless more creative approaches to funding and partnership working across all services are developed. ""These challenges will continue to drive much of the authority's priorities."" Last month, Nicola Sturgeon and Scottish Conservatives leader Jackson Carlawclashed over police fundingat First Minister's Questions. The meeting will also discuss the cost ofpolicing the UN climate change conferencein Glasgow in November, which has now been estimated at Â£250m.

"Kara said she ""couldn't deal with the thought of further masculisation"" Transgender patients are choosing to self-medicate with hormones bought online from unregulated sources due to waiting times to see NHS specialists, the BBC has learned. In many areas, some patients wait over two years to be seen, new figures show. England's target time is 18 weeks. One woman said she was so low it felt like a choice between self-medicating or suicide. NHS England said it had increased investment to respond to rising demand. Law student Kara told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme she began buying oestrogen - the hormone prescribed to trans women - last summer online, to begin her transition. She has been on an NHS gender identity clinic waiting list now for two years. She admitted she was ""absolutely petrified"" of the effects it could have on her. Many of the websites selling hormones are not based in the UK - and often ask users to pay by Bitcoin or bank transfer. ""I don't know anything about the tablets [that I buy] specifically, if they are what they say they are,"" she said. ""So it's kind of a guessing game with your life."" She told the BBC she felt the waiting times had ""forced"" her to make the choice to buy hormones online. ""I was so low before, it basically felt like a choice between suicide or self-medicating, because I couldn't deal with the thought of further masculisation,"" she added. Dr Grainne Coakley said those who were self-medicating, were putting themselves at risk One expert, Dr Grainne Coakley, from Sheffield's Gender Identity Clinic, said - with both testosterone and oestrogen tablets - there was an added risk of the clotting of the blood, and also a risk of liver problems. ""If that's not being monitored by a GP, somebody not having regular blood tests, then they are putting themselves at risk."" New figures, from a Freedom of Information request by the Victoria Derbyshire programme, show that in many areas some individuals are waiting over two years to be seen by a specialist, from referral. Gender identity clinics in Belfast (166 weeks), Nottinghamshire (145 weeks) and Northumberland (127 weeks) have the longest maximum wait times, data suggests. NHS Highland's gender identity clinic (32 weeks) has the shortest maximum wait. London's Tavistock clinic was not able to provide accurate figures, but anecdotal evidence points to patients waiting up to two years to be seen. More than 13,500 transgender and non-binary adults are on waiting lists for NHS gender identity clinics in England,previous BBC research has found. The Victoria Derbyshire programme bought four testosterone and oestrogen products online, to send to a laboratory for testing. Only three arrived. One, a testosterone sample, was supposed to be made up of four different types of the drug - but this was not the case, indicating it was a counterfeit product from an unknown source. Supplying or selling testosterone, a class C drug, is punishable by an unlimited fine or up to 14 years in jail. But it is not illegal to buy or possess it for personal use, provided it is not brought into the country via the postal system. Oestrogen is a prescription-only product, but if it is for personal use it can be legally imported without a prescription. In both cases experts stress it is only safe to use prescribed drugs, under the ongoing supervision of a medical expert. Lucas, who began transitioning six years ago aged 29, decided to use testosterone bought online after being told he would face a two-and-a-half year wait for a gender identity clinic appointment. He said he knows of at least one person who has taken their own life due to the ""distressing and dehumanising"" wait to be seen. Lucas described self-medicating as ""scary and unpleasant"", and believes the quality of the products was notably lower than those he is now prescribed. ""I suspect a few of the doses were effectively nothing, ""For example, I didn't actually start growing any facial hair at all until I moved onto prescribed testosterone."" NHS England told the BBC in a statement:  ""As more people feel able to seek support and treatment, the demand for gender identity services has greatly increased, and in recent years we've increased investment to respond to the rising demand, with staff working hard to support patients to get the right care as quickly as possible. ""From the spring a new service will be piloted in London that will increase capacity in gender identity services."" It is understood that a lack of medical professionals wanting to specialise in trans healthcare had also added to wait times, for which a new Royal College of Physicians pathway had been established. A Scottish government spokesman said long waiting times for patients were ""unacceptable"", but that health professionals were working hard to reduce them. He added: ""Gender identity clinics are a very specialised resource, and while people are waiting to be assessed they still have access to a full range of community mental health and well-being services appropriate to their situation and needs.""

"Two Britons on the ship, Sally and David Abel, have told their son they have tested positive for the virus Doubts have been raised over whether a British couple on a quarantined cruise ship in Japan have tested positive for coronavirus as earlier believed. The son of Sally and David Abel, from Northamptonshire, told the BBC his parents said they had both tested positive and were going to hospital. However, hours later David Abel suggested on Facebook there had been a ""massive communication error"". The couple are among 74 British nationals on the Diamond Princess ship. The ship, which was quarantined on 3 February, is in the port of Yokohama. On Tuesday, Japanese officials said there were 88 new cases of infection on board the ship, bringing the total to 542 confirmed cases. It is the largest cluster of cases outside China. The Foreign Office said it was ""working to organise a flight back to the UK"" for British nationals and an evacuation is expected to take place within the next two to three days. A spokesman for the Foreign Office said it had ""the utmost concern"" for the British people on the ship and was ""ensuring those who have been diagnosed with coronavirus receive the best possible care in Japan"". China releases largest study on Covid-19 outbreak How do you self-isolate due to coronavirus? Coronavirus: What you need to know Mr and Mrs Abel's son Steve told BBC Breakfast that his father had emailed him on Tuesday morning to tell him they had both tested positive. However, on Tuesday evening,a Facebook post,externalfrom Mr Abel's account explained the confusion over the positive test, saying the Japanese quarantine officials did not speak any English. He added: ""The consulate in Tokyo are being very good with me. I am being listened to and Sally & I feel really well."" This video can not be played Steve Abel, the son of a British couple on board the Diamond Princess, says they are ""in the dark"" Earlier, Steve said he could hear his father vomiting in the bathroom while on the phone to his mother earlier but he believed it was due to ""shock"" rather than a symptom of the disease. The conditions on the ship had made it difficult for his father to manage his type-2 diabetes, he said, adding that he would prefer his parents to be quarantined in the UK ""where the food is more suitable for my dad"". ""I'm not actually that worried about the virus - looking at the recovery stats. It is more about the stress, the diet,"" Steve said. Are coronavirus tests flawed? The noted Wuhan victims of the coronavirus Sport Relief trip moved over coronavirus fear Coronavirus forces Jaguar Land Rover to ship parts in suitcases Steve said the UK government's treatment of his parents had been ""appalling"", adding: ""They haven't got back to us on anything and we have been calling them every day for four or five days."" ""They are very high-spirited people,"" he said. ""But in the last two days I've seen the cracks in the armour and they are getting down."" About 3,700 people are quarantined on board the Diamond Princess Another British passenger on board the ship, Elaine Spencer, said she had been ""very disappointed"" with the UK government's initial response and they should have organised a rescue flight sooner. She told Radio 4's Today programme that British passengers who wanted to get on the rescue flight had to sign an agreement that they would go into quarantine for 14 days on their return to the UK. She said they had received a note from the Foreign Office which told them that if they didn't get on the flight, it was unlikely they would be allowed out of Japan. ""I need to go home, I want to see my family but obviously it's going to be another 14 days (after the flight). I wish that they'd decided to do this last week."" The US chartered two planes to bring back its citizens from the cruise ship The president of Princess Cruises, Jan Swartz, said the company has sent more doctors and nurses on to the ship. There is still uncertainty over whether passengers will be allowed to leave the ship at the end of the 14-day quarantine period on Wednesday. According to official figures on Monday, four Britons with confirmed coronavirus are currently in hospital in Japan. Irish foreign minister Simon Coveney confirmedtwo out of six Irish passengers on the Princess Diamond tested positive for the virusand are being treated in hospital in Japan. Mr Coveney said the passengers have dual citizenship with another EU member state and did not normally live in Ireland - but that the Irish embassy in Tokyo was in contact with them. On Tuesday South Korea joined the list of the countries and territories also planning to get their residents off the ship - a list which already includes Canada, Australia, the UK, Israel and Hong Kong. TheUS has already repatriated more than 300 of its citizensfrom the ship. In a statement in the early hours of Tuesday morning, the Foreign Office said its staff had been making ""necessary arrangements"" with British nationals onboard the ship to organise a flight back to the UK. ""We urge all those who have not yet responded to get in touch immediately,"" it added. Affected British nationals should call the British embassy in Tokyo on +81 3 5211 1100.

Early fears of the ship being affected by the virus meant it was turned away from five ports in Asia.Passengers were allowed off the shipon Friday after no cases were found among the 2,257 people onboard, cruise line firm Holland America said. The 83-year-old American woman tested positive after disembarking from the ship and then travelling to Malaysia. An undisclosed number of Britons who were on the Westerdam are being tested for coronavirus in Cambodia, the Foreign Office said. As of Tuesday at 14:00 GMT,,externalin the UK a total of 4,916 people had been tested for coronavirus. Only nine people have tested positive and the rest have been confirmed negative. In a phone call, President Xi of China thanked Prime Minister Boris Johnson for the UK's donation of ""vital medical equipment"" to help China cope with the virus outbreak, a Downing Street spokeswoman said.

"HSBC has said it will axe around 35,000 jobs as it announced profits for 2019 fell by about a third. That has spurred the bank to target $4.5bn (Â£3.5bn) of cost cuts by 2022 as part of a major restructuring. The bank's interim chief executive, Noel Quinn, said HSBC would scale back its headcount from 235,000 to about 200,000 over the next three years. HSBC, which makes the bulk of its revenue in Asia, reported annual profit before tax of $13.35bn (Â£10.3bn). It said the fall in profits was mainly due to $7.3bn in write-offs related to its investment and commercial banking operations in Europe. The 35,000 job losses are deeper than expected, and represent about 15% of the workforce. Analysts had expected about 10,000 jobs to be cut. HSBC restructuring plans fuel fears of job cuts HSBC customers hit by two IT glitches within hours HSBC and Santander customers set for refund The bank currently operates in more than 50 countries across North America, Europe, the Middle East and Asia. It employs more than 40,000 people in the UK, where it has its headquarters. HSBC's global headquarters in Canary Wharf About 10,000 of those are based at its head office in Canary Wharf in London, and another 2,000 work at itsnew UK head officein Birmingham. HSBC has said some of the cutbacks will be in its European and US investment banking businesses, although it has not been specific about where the job cuts will fall. Set up in 1865 to facilitate trade between Asia and Europe, the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, to give it its full name, is moving back to its roots. With most of its profits coming from Asia - and with an expectation that the region is the best bet for long term prospects - the bank's cuts will focus on its European and US operations. At present the bank is not detailing exactly where the cuts will come, but the interim boss, Noel Quinn, says reducing the workforce from the current 235,000 to ""nearer 200,000"" would be consistent with the Â£3bn or so he wants to save by 2022. There are four key areas that are likely to be affected: the UK investment bank, the group's central operations, the US retail banking outfit and - as in many businesses - those areas where jobs are being replaced by technology. With one in seven jobs set to go globally, employees may face an anxious time - but with HSBC seeing a turnover of 25,000 staff per year, the compulsory cuts may not be quite as brutal as they sound. Peter Hahn, banking expert and former dean of the London Institute of Banking & Finance, told the BBC's Today programme: ""I think they were too optimistic about their chances of their success in investment banking. ""The reality is that the biggest investment market in the world is the US, and if you're not big in the US in investment banking it's pretty tough to succeed in that business - and they're not."" The strategy overhaul comes as economic growth is slowing in HSBC's major markets. Asia now accounts for about half of HSBC's revenue and 90% of profits. The bank is also facing the impact of the coronavirus, the UK's protracted withdrawal from the European Union and historically low interest rates around the world. It will be the UK-based bank's third overhaul in a decade as it attempts to lift its profits. Mr Quinn told Reuters that the restructuring would mean ""that our headcount is likely to go from 235,000 to closer to 200,000 over the next three years"". The 57-year-old HSBC veteran was appointed interim chief executive in August last year following the ousting of John Flint. HSBC reiterated that it expects to make a permanent appointment within the next six to 12 months. Addressing the impact of coronavirus, HSBC said the full effect had not been fully accounted for in its latest earnings, raising the possibility that it could increase the amount it expects the outbreak to cost the bank. HSBC will also reduce the assets it owns by more than $100bn by the end of 2022 as part of sweeping reforms.

"Two Britons on the ship, Sally and David Abel, have told their son they have tested positive for the virus Doubts have been raised over whether a British couple on a quarantined cruise ship in Japan have tested positive for coronavirus as earlier believed. The son of Sally and David Abel, from Northamptonshire, told the BBC his parents said they had both tested positive and were going to hospital. However, hours later David Abel suggested on Facebook there had been a ""massive communication error"". The couple are among 74 British nationals on the Diamond Princess ship. The ship, which was quarantined on 3 February, is in the port of Yokohama. On Tuesday, Japanese officials said there were 88 new cases of infection on board the ship, bringing the total to 542 confirmed cases. It is the largest cluster of cases outside China. The Foreign Office said it was ""working to organise a flight back to the UK"" for British nationals and an evacuation is expected to take place within the next two to three days. A spokesman for the Foreign Office said it had ""the utmost concern"" for the British people on the ship and was ""ensuring those who have been diagnosed with coronavirus receive the best possible care in Japan"". China releases largest study on Covid-19 outbreak How do you self-isolate due to coronavirus? Coronavirus: What you need to know Mr and Mrs Abel's son Steve told BBC Breakfast that his father had emailed him on Tuesday morning to tell him they had both tested positive. However, on Tuesday evening,a Facebook post,externalfrom Mr Abel's account explained the confusion over the positive test, saying the Japanese quarantine officials did not speak any English. He added: ""The consulate in Tokyo are being very good with me. I am being listened to and Sally & I feel really well."" This video can not be played Steve Abel, the son of a British couple on board the Diamond Princess, says they are ""in the dark"" Earlier, Steve said he could hear his father vomiting in the bathroom while on the phone to his mother earlier but he believed it was due to ""shock"" rather than a symptom of the disease. The conditions on the ship had made it difficult for his father to manage his type-2 diabetes, he said, adding that he would prefer his parents to be quarantined in the UK ""where the food is more suitable for my dad"". ""I'm not actually that worried about the virus - looking at the recovery stats. It is more about the stress, the diet,"" Steve said. Are coronavirus tests flawed? The noted Wuhan victims of the coronavirus Sport Relief trip moved over coronavirus fear Coronavirus forces Jaguar Land Rover to ship parts in suitcases Steve said the UK government's treatment of his parents had been ""appalling"", adding: ""They haven't got back to us on anything and we have been calling them every day for four or five days."" ""They are very high-spirited people,"" he said. ""But in the last two days I've seen the cracks in the armour and they are getting down."" About 3,700 people are quarantined on board the Diamond Princess Another British passenger on board the ship, Elaine Spencer, said she had been ""very disappointed"" with the UK government's initial response and they should have organised a rescue flight sooner. She told Radio 4's Today programme that British passengers who wanted to get on the rescue flight had to sign an agreement that they would go into quarantine for 14 days on their return to the UK. She said they had received a note from the Foreign Office which told them that if they didn't get on the flight, it was unlikely they would be allowed out of Japan. ""I need to go home, I want to see my family but obviously it's going to be another 14 days (after the flight). I wish that they'd decided to do this last week."" The US chartered two planes to bring back its citizens from the cruise ship The president of Princess Cruises, Jan Swartz, said the company has sent more doctors and nurses on to the ship. There is still uncertainty over whether passengers will be allowed to leave the ship at the end of the 14-day quarantine period on Wednesday. According to official figures on Monday, four Britons with confirmed coronavirus are currently in hospital in Japan. Irish foreign minister Simon Coveney confirmedtwo out of six Irish passengers on the Princess Diamond tested positive for the virusand are being treated in hospital in Japan. Mr Coveney said the passengers have dual citizenship with another EU member state and did not normally live in Ireland - but that the Irish embassy in Tokyo was in contact with them. On Tuesday South Korea joined the list of the countries and territories also planning to get their residents off the ship - a list which already includes Canada, Australia, the UK, Israel and Hong Kong. TheUS has already repatriated more than 300 of its citizensfrom the ship. In a statement in the early hours of Tuesday morning, the Foreign Office said its staff had been making ""necessary arrangements"" with British nationals onboard the ship to organise a flight back to the UK. ""We urge all those who have not yet responded to get in touch immediately,"" it added. Affected British nationals should call the British embassy in Tokyo on +81 3 5211 1100.

Early fears of the ship being affected by the virus meant it was turned away from five ports in Asia.Passengers were allowed off the shipon Friday after no cases were found among the 2,257 people onboard, cruise line firm Holland America said. The 83-year-old American woman tested positive after disembarking from the ship and then travelling to Malaysia. An undisclosed number of Britons who were on the Westerdam are being tested for coronavirus in Cambodia, the Foreign Office said.

"HSBC has said it will axe around 35,000 jobs as it announced profits for 2019 fell by about a third. That has spurred the bank to target $4.5bn (Â£3.5bn) of cost cuts by 2022 as part of a major restructuring. The bank's interim chief executive, Noel Quinn, said HSBC would scale back its headcount from 235,000 to about 200,000 over the next three years. HSBC, which makes the bulk of its revenue in Asia, reported annual profit before tax of $13.35bn (Â£10.3bn). It said the fall in profits was mainly due to $7.3bn in write-offs related to its investment and commercial banking operations in Europe. The 35,000 job losses are deeper than expected, and represent about 15% of the workforce. Analysts had expected about 10,000 jobs to be cut. HSBC restructuring plans fuel fears of job cuts HSBC customers hit by two IT glitches within hours HSBC and Santander customers set for refund The bank currently operates in more than 50 countries across North America, Europe, the Middle East and Asia. It employs more than 40,000 people in the UK, where it has its headquarters. HSBC's global headquarters in Canary Wharf About 10,000 of those are based at its head office in Canary Wharf in London, and another 2,000 work at itsnew UK head officein Birmingham.

Set up in 1865 to facilitate trade between Asia and Europe, the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, to give it its full name, is moving back to its roots.

There are four key areas that are likely to be affected: the UK investment bank, the group's central operations, the US retail banking outfit and - as in many businesses - those areas where jobs are being replaced by technology. With one in seven jobs set to go globally, employees may face an anxious time - but with HSBC seeing a turnover of 25,000 staff per year, the compulsory cuts may not be quite as brutal as they sound.

The bank is also facing the impact of the coronavirus, the UK's protracted withdrawal from the European Union and historically low interest rates around the world.

"HSBC has said it will axe around 35,000 jobs as it announced profits for 2019 fell by about a third. That has spurred the bank to target $4.5bn (Â£3.5bn) of cost cuts by 2022 as part of a major restructuring. The bank's interim chief executive, Noel Quinn, said HSBC would scale back its headcount from 235,000 to about 200,000 over the next three years. HSBC, which makes the bulk of its revenue in Asia, reported annual profit before tax of $13.35bn (Â£10.3bn). It said the fall in profits was mainly due to $7.3bn in write-offs related to its investment and commercial banking operations in Europe. The 35,000 job losses are deeper than expected, and represent about 15% of the workforce. Analysts had expected about 10,000 jobs to be cut. HSBC restructuring plans fuel fears of job cuts HSBC customers hit by two IT glitches within hours HSBC and Santander customers set for refund The bank currently operates in more than 50 countries across North America, Europe, the Middle East and Asia. It employs more than 40,000 people in the UK, where it has its headquarters. HSBC's global headquarters in Canary Wharf About 10,000 of those are based at its head office in Canary Wharf in London, and another 2,000 work at itsnew UK head officein Birmingham. HSBC has said some of the cutbacks will be in its European and US investment banking businesses, although it has not been specific about where the job cuts will fall. Set up in 1865 to facilitate trade between Asia and Europe, the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, to give it its full name, is moving back to its roots. With most of its profits coming from Asia - and with an expectation that the region is the best bet for long term prospects - the bank's cuts will focus on its European and US operations. At present the bank is not detailing exactly where the cuts will come, but the interim boss, Noel Quinn, says reducing the workforce from the current 235,000 to ""nearer 200,000"" would be consistent with the Â£3bn or so he wants to save by 2022. There are four key areas that are likely to be affected: the UK investment bank, the group's central operations, the US retail banking outfit and - as in many businesses - those areas where jobs are being replaced by technology. With one in seven jobs set to go globally, employees may face an anxious time - but with HSBC seeing a turnover of 25,000 staff per year, the compulsory cuts may not be quite as brutal as they sound. Peter Hahn, banking expert and former dean of the London Institute of Banking & Finance, told the BBC's Today programme: ""I think they were too optimistic about their chances of their success in investment banking. ""The reality is that the biggest investment market in the world is the US, and if you're not big in the US in investment banking it's pretty tough to succeed in that business - and they're not."" The strategy overhaul comes as economic growth is slowing in HSBC's major markets. Asia now accounts for about half of HSBC's revenue and 90% of profits. The bank is also facing the impact of the coronavirus, the UK's protracted withdrawal from the European Union and historically low interest rates around the world. It will be the UK-based bank's third overhaul in a decade as it attempts to lift its profits. Mr Quinn told Reuters that the restructuring would mean ""that our headcount is likely to go from 235,000 to closer to 200,000 over the next three years"". The 57-year-old HSBC veteran was appointed interim chief executive in August last year following the ousting of John Flint. HSBC reiterated that it expects to make a permanent appointment within the next six to 12 months. Addressing the impact of coronavirus, HSBC said the full effect had not been fully accounted for in its latest earnings, raising the possibility that it could increase the amount it expects the outbreak to cost the bank. HSBC will also reduce the assets it owns by more than $100bn by the end of 2022 as part of sweeping reforms.

"This video can not be played This video has been removed for rights reasons Love Island narrator Iain Stirling has said he is ""absolutely devastated"" at the death of his colleague Caroline Flack, in a tribute on the ITV2 show. The message in Monday's episode came after the TV host, 40, wasfound dead in her north London home on Saturday. ""You were a true friend to me,"" Stirling said. He added that Flack's ""warmth and infectious enthusiasm"" were ""crucial"" to the show's success. A lawyer for Flack's family said she had taken her own life. The Love Island episode was the first to air after her death. ITV had cancelled two episodes as a mark of respect for the presenter. Flack was replaced as host of the dating show after being charged with assaulting her boyfriend last year. Speaking at the opening of the show, Stirling said: ""We are absolutely devastated by the tragic news that Caroline, a much-loved member of our Love Island family, has passed away. ""Our thoughts are with her family and friends at this dreadful time. ""Caroline and me were together from the very start of Love Island and her passion, warmth and infectious enthusiasm were a crucial part of what made the show connect with millions of viewers."" If you or someone you know needs support for issues about emotional distress,these organisationsmay be able to help. Stirling's message was broadcast to images of the ocean, in keeping with the usual opening shots at the beginning of each episode - but to mark the tribute there was no background music. Stirling's voice broke as he added: ""Caroline, I want to thank you for all the fun times we had making our favourite show. You were a true friend to me. I'm going to miss you, Caz."" The tribute ended with a photo of Flack on screen. The image was repeated at the end of the episode. Looking back at Caroline Flack's career Presenter attacks trolls over Flack death Flack's boyfriend: 'My heart is broken' In a statement released on Monday, ITV's director of televisionKevin Lygo said staff at the TV station were ""devastated""and ""still trying to process this tragic news"". He said Flack had been part of the dating show ""from the very beginning"", was ""very vocal"" in her support of the show, and that viewers ""could relate to her and she to them"". Lygo stressed that ITV ""made it clear that the door was left open for her to return and the Love Island production team remained in regular contact with her and continued to offer support over the last few months"". It was confirmed on Tuesday that the inquest into the death of the presenter is due open on Wednesday morning at Poplar Coroner's Court in east London. ITV cancelled Monday night's episode of Love Island: Aftersun and said it would not be releasing a Love Island: The Morning After podcast on Tuesday morning.

'Be kind,' social-media users urge after Flack death Who decides whether someone should go on trial? Flack stood down from the show after she was charged with assaulting her boyfriend, Lewis Burton, in December. Her management company said she had been ""under huge pressure"" since then and criticised the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) for refusing to drop the charge, even though Mr Burton said he did not want the case to go ahead. Flack denied the charge and was due to stand trial in March. Bail conditions had stopped Flack having any contact with Mr Burton ahead of the trial On Instagram, Flack's friend Mollie Grosberg shared a picture of Flack taken on Friday night, the last time she saw her The CPS said it would not comment on the specifics of the case but in response to questions about its role, on Sunday it outlinedhow it reached decisions over whether or not to charge someone,external.

"Two Britons on the ship, Sally and David Abel, have told their son they have tested positive for the virus Doubts have been raised over whether a British couple on a quarantined cruise ship in Japan have tested positive for coronavirus as earlier believed. The son of Sally and David Abel, from Northamptonshire, told the BBC his parents said they had both tested positive and were going to hospital. However, hours later David Abel suggested on Facebook there had been a ""massive communication error"". The couple are among 74 British nationals on the Diamond Princess ship. The ship, which was quarantined on 3 February, is in the port of Yokohama. On Tuesday, Japanese officials said there were 88 new cases of infection on board the ship, bringing the total to 542 confirmed cases. It is the largest cluster of cases outside China. The Foreign Office said it was ""working to organise a flight back to the UK"" for British nationals and an evacuation is expected to take place within the next two to three days. A spokesman for the Foreign Office said it had ""the utmost concern"" for the British people on the ship and was ""ensuring those who have been diagnosed with coronavirus receive the best possible care in Japan"". China releases largest study on Covid-19 outbreak How do you self-isolate due to coronavirus? Coronavirus: What you need to know Mr and Mrs Abel's son Steve told BBC Breakfast that his father had emailed him on Tuesday morning to tell him they had both tested positive. However, on Tuesday evening,a Facebook post,externalfrom Mr Abel's account explained the confusion over the positive test, saying the Japanese quarantine officials did not speak any English. He added: ""The consulate in Tokyo are being very good with me. I am being listened to and Sally & I feel really well."" This video can not be played Steve Abel, the son of a British couple on board the Diamond Princess, says they are ""in the dark"" Earlier, Steve said he could hear his father vomiting in the bathroom while on the phone to his mother earlier but he believed it was due to ""shock"" rather than a symptom of the disease. The conditions on the ship had made it difficult for his father to manage his type-2 diabetes, he said, adding that he would prefer his parents to be quarantined in the UK ""where the food is more suitable for my dad"". ""I'm not actually that worried about the virus - looking at the recovery stats. It is more about the stress, the diet,"" Steve said. Are coronavirus tests flawed? The noted Wuhan victims of the coronavirus Sport Relief trip moved over coronavirus fear Coronavirus forces Jaguar Land Rover to ship parts in suitcases Steve said the UK government's treatment of his parents had been ""appalling"", adding: ""They haven't got back to us on anything and we have been calling them every day for four or five days."" ""They are very high-spirited people,"" he said. ""But in the last two days I've seen the cracks in the armour and they are getting down."" About 3,700 people are quarantined on board the Diamond Princess Another British passenger on board the ship, Elaine Spencer, said she had been ""very disappointed"" with the UK government's initial response and they should have organised a rescue flight sooner. She told Radio 4's Today programme that British passengers who wanted to get on the rescue flight had to sign an agreement that they would go into quarantine for 14 days on their return to the UK. She said they had received a note from the Foreign Office which told them that if they didn't get on the flight, it was unlikely they would be allowed out of Japan. ""I need to go home, I want to see my family but obviously it's going to be another 14 days (after the flight). I wish that they'd decided to do this last week."" The US chartered two planes to bring back its citizens from the cruise ship The president of Princess Cruises, Jan Swartz, said the company has sent more doctors and nurses on to the ship. There is still uncertainty over whether passengers will be allowed to leave the ship at the end of the 14-day quarantine period on Wednesday. According to official figures on Monday, four Britons with confirmed coronavirus are currently in hospital in Japan. Irish foreign minister Simon Coveney confirmedtwo out of six Irish passengers on the Princess Diamond tested positive for the virusand are being treated in hospital in Japan. Mr Coveney said the passengers have dual citizenship with another EU member state and did not normally live in Ireland - but that the Irish embassy in Tokyo was in contact with them. On Tuesday South Korea joined the list of the countries and territories also planning to get their residents off the ship - a list which already includes Canada, Australia, the UK, Israel and Hong Kong. TheUS has already repatriated more than 300 of its citizensfrom the ship. In a statement in the early hours of Tuesday morning, the Foreign Office said its staff had been making ""necessary arrangements"" with British nationals onboard the ship to organise a flight back to the UK. ""We urge all those who have not yet responded to get in touch immediately,"" it added. Affected British nationals should call the British embassy in Tokyo on +81 3 5211 1100.

Early fears of the ship being affected by the virus meant it was turned away from five ports in Asia.Passengers were allowed off the shipon Friday after no cases were found among the 2,257 people onboard, cruise line firm Holland America said. The 83-year-old American woman tested positive after disembarking from the ship and then travelling to Malaysia. An undisclosed number of Britons who were on the Westerdam are being tested for coronavirus in Cambodia, the Foreign Office said. As of Tuesday at 14:00 GMT,,externalin the UK a total of 4,916 people had been tested for coronavirus. Only nine people have tested positive and the rest have been confirmed negative.

"Private jet operators have seen a big spike in requests from passengers wanting to charter their own planes during the coronavirus outbreak. With airlines scaling back flights in and out of China, some travellers are stuck inside or outside the country. The wealthy ones are turning to private jet operators to ask them to arrange flights, despite the huge costs. But the companies are having to turn them away due to travel bans and a lack of available planes and crews. Australia-based Darin Voyles, of Paramount Business Jets, said the firm had seen a ''considerable uptick'' in requests, but the majority can't be filled as they can't get the crew or planes. ""Many simply do not want to send their aircraft and crews into mainland China. Aside from the risk of exposure for the crews, the operational and business concern is that when they return from mainland China they will essentially be unable to work for two weeks as they will have to go into quarantine immediately.'' Singapore-based MyJet Asia said it has seen an increase of 80%-90% in the last month. ""A lot of people went away for Chinese New Year and are now struggling to get back to China,"" said Logan Ravishkansar, chief executive of MyJet Asia. Many have asked to be flown back to Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong. This video can not be played Footage appearing to show people held in quarantine in a makeshift facility in Wuhan, has been shared across social media ""But we are massively restricted on where we can fly to, while the airlines are not letting us charter their planes despite the money,"" he added. China accuses US of spreading coronavirus 'panic' Why a global city is so vulnerable to virus spread China coronavirus deaths and cases spike Other travellers are desperate to get out of China. A government client from South America asked PrivateFly, a global booking service for charter flights, ''to set up four flights out of Wuhan for hundreds of passengers,'' according to its chief executive Adam Twidell. The UK-based firm said it has had plenty of other enquiries from private individuals and groups. A ''very light jet'' can take between two and four passengers, and costs up to $2,400 (Â£1,850) per hour according to Paramount Business Jets. A ""super midsize"" jet can seat between eight and 10 people and costs $6,000 an hour. Global private jet firm VistaJet said it has seen double digit growth in enquiries over the past month even though it has stopped operations to and from China. ""While a large portion of the increase can be related to Chinese New Year travel, we also attribute the growth to customers preferring a private flight rather than a commercial option during a delicate time affected by the coronavirus outbreak,"" said Ian Moore, chief commercial officer of VistaJet. Mr Ravishkansar said it was much more straightforward to charter planes during the SARS outbreak of 2003: ""We also saw huge demand back then but it was a lot easier to fly in and out of countries. This time around, governments have put on more controls."" How can I tell if I've got Covid?
