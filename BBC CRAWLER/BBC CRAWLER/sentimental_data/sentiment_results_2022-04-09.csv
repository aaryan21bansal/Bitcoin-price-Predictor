"Danielle has written a book that looks at dwarfism from the viewpoint of children A woman with dwarfism who faces frequent abuse on the street is visiting schools in a bid to stamp out prejudice. Danielle Webb, 23, said changing the minds of ignorant adults was difficult, so her focus was on educating children. Danielle, who is 3ft 11.5in (1.2m), said being called names and laughed at ""just becomes our norm"". Earlier this week, adocumentary about a new drugdeveloped to treat Danielle's condition aired on BBC One. Vosoritide, which has been developed to treat children with the most common form of dwarfismachondroplasia,external, is already available in the US and the NHS has run trials for a potential roll out in the UK. A World Without Dwarfism? Teacher takes on Snow White stereotypes Fats Timbo: 'I thought I was cursed' Every day, when Master of Arts student Danielle leaves her home in Newport to go to the University of South Wales or to work at youth arts organisation Urban Circle, she has to steel herself for the mockery, name-calling, stares and occasionally people trying to take photos that she has come to expect. ""Anyone with dwarfism will tell you the typical is just the stares and the laughs,"" said Danielle, who is originally from Portishead, Somerset. ""'Look at her, what's that all about?' Just like schoolground behaviour. ""I've been called names on the street, we've been in positions as a group where people have tried - not always successfully - to get a photo... where that goes afterwards is obviously completely out of our control."" Danielle works with Newport's Urban Circle to support young people to discover their potential She said she was able to brush it off ""nine times out of 10"", adding: ""There is always that one time where you're like 'I can't do this, this is ridiculous'. ""It is challenging on the bad daysâ¦ [but] it just becomes our norm."" Once she has arrived at work or university it is a challenge not to let it get her down: ""You can't let it break you every single day."" As well as the abuse from strangers, she said she and others like her have to navigate a world built for people of average height. Daily challenges include supermarkets where trolley handles are too high and items are difficult to reach from shelves, as well as out-of-reach cash points, train ticket machines and sinks in public toilets. ""If I sit down and really think about everything I have to overcome in a day or a week, that can kind of scare you,"" she said. All this fires her up to fight for change. Last year her book Mummy There's A New Girl was published and it is being developed for the stage by Thunk-It Theatre in York. It tells the story of a girl who is picked on for her looks before a brave child looks past her differences and learns that size is no big deal. With Wales now at Covidalert level zero,externalshe has begun visiting schools. ""Educating people about my condition has always seemed very daunting,"" said Danielle. ""Most of the time with adults, the ones that listen are the good ones anyway, they're not the ones that actually need educating. ""Instead of channelling my energy into trying to change opinions I need to be there when the opinions are formed."" Danielle's parents are of average height and were told she had dwarfism four weeks before she was born Following a recent visit to Maindee Primary School in Newport, she believes her instincts were right. ""Half way in [the children] didn't really care that I was small, they were like 'yeah, OK, whatever', they were more excited that I was an author and I was someone new,"" she said. ""We did talk about dwarfism but it wasn't really needed because as far as they were concerned, I was just another adult."" Danielle (pictured with a friend) says she is very comfortable in her own skin She is convinced this is the way to end prejudice: ""I have no doubt that every child in that room will grow up accepting and understanding differences, because that's exactly the response that they showed me when I went in."" She said she believed some adults had discriminatory attitudes because ""their questions weren't answered and they weren't exposed to more visible disability when they were younger"". In a recent documentary, five-time Paralympic champion swimmerEllie Simmonds expressed concernsthe drug vosoritide could potentially, ""eradicate dwarfism"" but spoke to others who saw its development as a helpful breakthrough. Danielle said: ""The people who choose to take it should be treated with exactly the same kindness as the people who don't choose to take it. ""Bad days aside, I'm very comfortable in my skin... I wouldn't have the life I do now if I didn't have dwarfism - but do I still understand why someone would chose to take it? Of course."" She said she wanted to see more of a focus on education, social awareness and making the world more accessible to people with dwarfism ""so if the injections come to the UK they aren't seen as the only solution"". Danielle said she knew many people with dwarfism who had achieved success in their professional, personal and academic lives. ""Yes, we live with the challenges out there, but that doesn't mean our quality of life is any different or our abilities in life are any different,"" she said. ""We need to educate the world it's actually something to be promoted and celebrated."" What does Simmonds think about new dwarfism drug?

"There have been urgent calls for investigations into allegations of war crimes in previously Russian-held areas of Ukraine after shocking footage of murdered civilians. But there are wider questions over whether widespread Russian attacks on civilian targets amount to war crimes. We've been looking at a series of attacks in one city - Chernihiv - to see whether they are consistent with Russian tactics across Ukraine and reveal something of their strategy. The following report contains some graphic details. ""They were shooting at us with everything they had,"" says Diana, 20. Within minutes of encountering the Russian tank, half her family would be dead. Diana, her mother Irina, her partner Sasha and his little brother Maxim were fleeing Chernihiv on 9 March after weeks of shelling. They had one simple aim - to reach safety in the west of the country, where relatives were waiting for them. But within minutes of leaving the city heading south they were plunged into danger. As their Volkswagen Golf passed the village of Kolychivka, Sasha saw Russian tanks ahead. One fired at them immediately. He put his foot down, hoping to accelerate through the danger zone - and then the car stalled. Sasha, Diana and Maxim, and Diana with her mother Irina The firing continued, and Sasha shouted for them get out - but 15-year-old Maxim had already been hit. There was a hole in his chest and blood coming from his mouth. Diana, Sasha and Irina crawled into bushes - but soldiers were approaching, shouting to each other, asking where the family were hiding. Bullets cracked towards them. Diana's foot was seriously injured. Sasha tried to bandage it, but then as he turned to help Irina, the horror worsened. ""Irina opened her jacket and we realised that there was nothing to bandage,"" Diana told BBC News. ""A part of her abdomen and intestines had been shot through."" They heard more shooting and Diana turned to Sasha believing these were their final minutes. ""We had time to say that we loved each other,"" she said. ""I asked Sasha, 'Are we going to die here?' He said, 'Probably'. ""My mum crawled with us a little more. I kept turning and saying, 'Mum, crawl, please, please'. She said, 'Yes, yes'. And then she [lay] down on the ground. She died there."" Diana kept crawling, following Sasha as he broke a path for her through the thicket. They went past a burning field and through the forest. Diana and Sasha survived and she made it to a hospital. She has lost four toes from her left foot. Diana has no doubt the attackers were Russian because of their accents, uniforms and the Z symbol daubed on one of the tanks. The BBC's verification team has found no evidence of any legitimate military targets near the site of the attack. Attacks on civilians in cars elsewhere Regional authorities say at least 25 civilians, including six children, have been killed in attacks on cars trying to flee Chernihiv, or attacked in public places, since the start of the conflict Footage filmed by a Ukrainian drone in the Kyiv regionshowed the killing of a man who had raised his armsin the air as he got out of a car. His wife was shot dead inside the vehicle In the Kherson region of southern Ukraine a family of five waskilled by Russian soldiers at a checkpoint, according to relatives Water is the most basic of human necessities and there is evidence of deliberate Russian targeting of the supply in Chernihiv. A pumping station on the outskirts of the city was hit on 14 March. The attack badly damaged a water reservoir and destroyed a control room, according to the head of the water company in Chernihiv, Serhiy Malyavko, who said a worker at the plant - along with three family members - were killed. The family was sheltering there after their home was destroyed by shelling. Satellite imagery shows the damage to the plant, located by Twitter user @obretix in a forested area far away from other buildings. Photos released by the water companyshowed a severely damaged treatment tank,externalwith small craters in the ground. Damage that looks like shrapnel holes pepper the buildings. The sequence of craters visible in a satellite image suggests ground-launched strikes, says Wim Zwijnenburg, an arms researcher at Pax, a Dutch peace organisation. ""The shrapnel impact and blast direction seem to indicate the missiles were fired from the west of the water facility, [which] corresponds with the presence of Russian troop movements located to the west, according to public data on their locations."" Without access to the site itself, the experts we've spoken to say it's not possible to be precise about the weapons used. Rather than missiles, the damage may have been caused by heavy guns or mortars. The Chernihiv Water Company released pictures of other sites that had been attacked The head of the water company says the site was struck three days in a row. ""There was no military target. I'm 100% sure that the Russian troops have been destroying the city's infrastructure so that there would be no gas, no electricity or water supply in the city,"" Mr Malyavko told BBC News. He said two other facilities elsewhere were also destroyed, cutting off water to most of the city's population. The rules of war ban premeditated attacks on targets indispensable to civilian life, such as water supplies. ""This has been done to make the population panic,"" says Mr Malyavko. ""And Russia is probably hoping that if there's a humanitarian catastrophe, the local authorities will agree to start negotiations - and that the city will surrender."" Attacks on water elsewhere Mariupol City Council says Russian forces intentionally targeted pumping stations and the main water pipeline from a reservoir there The Ukrainian government has reported severe damage to several other water utilities and waste-treatment plants across the country It was the morning of 16 March, and Ukrainian journalist Alina Klimenko received news of a much-needed bread delivery to the city. Her father, Vitalii, dashed to join the queue. But after a short while he moved away as a nearby house came under fire. Others, now used to the sound of shelling in the city, stayed. And then the queue itself was hit. Alina ran out to film the aftermath. Her footage showed bodies on the ground and an ambulance racing to the scene. At least 14 civilians died, according to Ukrainian authorities. We have confirmed the authenticity of Alina's video and located it to a residential area in the city. Alina's father, who has a military background, says the incoming fire was from the north-east, consistent with the attack being launched by Russian units operating several kilometres to the north of Chernihiv, according to the mapping team at the Institute for the Study of War (ISW). Weapons expert Mark Cancian looked at the BBC's research. He said the damage was consistent with the impact of a missile with a range of up to 30km (19 miles). A satellite image from 16 March shows Russian forces with this kind of weaponry 14km north-east of the city. The US Embassy in Kyiv initially wrongly reported that Russian forces in the city had shot dead the civilians. This was quickly denied by Moscow who said no Russian troops were present in the city. But the Russians went further, saying the event had either been staged, or that those killed were victims of ""Ukrainian nationalists"". There have been numerous examples of this type of denial from the Russian government. Russian denial of responsibility elsewhere Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov claimed that footage of bodies in Bucha was ""staged"" after the Russians withdrew. Satellite images contradicted this andthe BBC debunked various other claimsmade by Russian officials The Russian embassy in London falsely claimed that the bombing of a maternity hospital in Mariupol in March was staged.The BBC found evidence to disprove their claims An estimated 300 people were killed in an attack on a theatre sheltering civilians in  Mariupol. Russia has denied carrying out the attack, which has been widely condemned A critical factor in any prosecution for war crimes is obtaining clear evidence of a deliberate intent to target civilians. Images and eye-witness statements can be the starting point, says Prof Alex Whiting, a former investigations co-ordinator at the International Criminal Court. But investigators would then need to tackle a series of basic questions: Is there any way these targets could have been perceived to be military? Were there any military targets in the area? Could the targeting have been based on faulty intelligence or even down to a weapons mistake? A hotel and a football stadium in Chernihiv were hit Throughout the conflict, the Ukrainian intelligence services have been releasing allegedly intercepted communications between Russian forces. In one, a man with a Russian accent can be heard being ordered to shoot at a civilian car. The authenticity of these conversations has not been verified by the BBC. But by building a picture of consistent patterns of behaviour, the case for prosecution becomes stronger. Sareta Ashraph, an expert in human-rights law, says investigators would be looking to establish these patterns of behaviour across the country - whether water facilities, hospitals or supermarkets had been regularly hit - in order to build up a picture of military strategy. ""This can show evidence of deliberate targeting, where the intent to bring the civilian population to its knees becomes much clearer,"" she says. As the war continues, Ms Ashraph says she's reminded of Russian tactics in previous conflicts. ""I would say that Russia's actions in Ukraine contain some quite dark echoes of actions in Syria,"" she said. We contacted the Russian defence ministry about all of the cases documented in this article. We have not yet received a response.

"Woman surveys wreckage of Bucha near Kyiv Nato ministers have been meeting in Brussels this past week to discuss how far they should go in providing military equipment to Ukraine. The challenge for Nato throughout this war has been how to give its ally Ukraine enough military support to defend itself without getting drawn into the conflict and finding itself at war with Russia. The Ukrainian government has been explicit in its calls for help. If it is to have any chance of fending off the coming Russian assault on the Donbas region in the east of the country, it says, then it urgently needs a resupply of the West's Javelin, NLAW (next-generation light anti-tank weapon), Stinger and Starstreak anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles that its forces have already been using to such effect in this war. That much is coming. But Ukraine wants more. It wants tanks, warplanes, drones and advanced missile air defence systems to counter Russia's increasing use of air strikes and long-range missiles that are steadily depleting Ukraine's strategic stores of fuel and other essentials. What weapons will US give Ukraine? Has Putin's plan failed? Watch on BBC iPlayer So what exactly, many people may ask, is holding Nato back? The answer is escalation. The risk of Russia resorting to using tactical (ie short range) nuclear weapons or of the conflict spreading beyond Ukraine's borders into a wider European war is constantly in the backs of western leaders' minds and here the stakes are dangerously high. over 30 countries have provided military aid to Ukraine including â¬1bn (Â£800m) from EU and $1.7bn (Â£1.3bn) from US supplies so far limited to arms, ammunition, and defensive equipment like anti-tank and anti-aircraft missile systems they includeJavelinswhich are shoulder-held anti-tank weapons that shoot heat-seeking rockets andStingerswhich are man-portable anti-aircraft weapons most famously used in Afghanistan against Soviet aircraft theStarstreakis a UK-made portable air defence system Nato members fear supplying heavier offensive equipment like tanks and fighter jets could lead to direct open conflict with Russia That hasn't prevented the Czechs from givingT72 tanks President Putin reminded the world early on in this war that Russia is a nuclear weapons power and that he was moving its strategic nuclear deterrent up to a higher degree of readiness. The US did not follow suit as it detected no movement of Russian nuclear warheads out of their secure storage bunkers. But Putin's point was made. He was effectively saying: ""Russia has a massive nuclear arsenal so don't think you can push us around."" Russian military doctrine allows for the early use of low-yield, tactical nuclear warheads on the battlefield, knowing that the West has an abhorrence for nuclear weapons that have not been used in anger for 77 years. Nato strategic planners worry that once the nuclear taboo is broken, even if the damage is limited to a localised target on the Ukrainian battlefield, then the risk of escalation to a catastrophic nuclear exchange between Russia and the West inevitably goes up a notch.  $800min new military assistance, including... 800Stinger anti-aircraft systems that can shoot down planes 2,000Javelins, shoulder-held anti-tank weapons that shoot heat-seeking rockets 6,000AT-4 anti-armor systems, a Swedish-produced, single-use, unguided anti-tank weapon And yet, with every atrocity apparently committed by Russian soldiers, Nato's resolve stiffens and its inhibitions melt away. The Czech Republic has already sent tanks, admittedly outdated Soviet-era T72s, but they are the first Nato country to do so. Slovakia is sending its S300 air defence missile systems. Both such moves would have seemed improbably risky when this war began. Tobias Ellwood MP, who chairs Parliament's Defence Committee, is one of those who believes Putin is bluffing when he raises the spectre of nuclear weapons and that Nato should be doing more. 'We have been over-cautious in the weapons systems we have been willing to provide,"" he says. ""We need a more robust attitude. We're giving the Ukrainians enough to survive but not to win and that must change."" So how exactly could this Russia-Ukraine war escalate into a wider pan-European conflict that drags in Nato? There are a number of potential scenarios which will doubtless be occupying minds in Western defence ministries. Here are just three of them: 1.A Nato-supplied anti-ship missile fired by Ukrainian forces in Odesa hits and sinks a Russian warship offshore in the Black Sea with the loss of nearly 100 sailors and dozens of marines. A death toll of this magnitude in a single strike would be unprecedented and Putin would be under pressure to respond in some form. 2.A Russian strategic missile strike targets a supply convoy of military hardware crossing from a Nato country, like Poland or Slovakia, into Ukraine. If casualties were sustained on Nato's side of the border that could potentially trigger Article 5 of Nato's constitution, bringing the entire alliance to the defence of the country attacked. 3.Amidst fierce fighting in the Donbas an explosion occurs at an industrial facility resulting in the release of toxic chemical gases. While this has already occurred, there were no deaths reported. But were it to result in the sort of mass casualties seen in Syria's use of poison gas at Ghouta and if it were found to have been deliberately caused by Russian forces, then Nato would be obliged to respond. It is perfectly possible that none of these scenarios will materialise. But while Western nations have displayed a rare degree of unity in the strength of their reaction to Russia's invasion, there are suggestions that they are being merely reactive and not thinking through what the endgame should be. This video can not be played This video, shared by Ukrainian armed forces, shows a Russian helicopter being shot down by a missile ""The bigger strategic question,"" says one of Britain's most experienced military officers who asks not to be named, ""is whether our government is engaged in crisis management or actual strategy."" That would require thinking this through to the finish, he adds. ""What we are trying to achieve here is to give Ukraine every bit of help we can, short of World War Three. The problem is, Putin is a better poker player than we are."" Tobias Ellwood MP agrees. ""Russia does this [the threat of escalation] very effectively. And we are spooked. We have lost the ability to control the escalatory ladder.""

"Satellite image of Luninets airfield, Belarus, during the build-up to Russia's attack on Ukraine Traditionally, it is the job of a spy to keep secrets - but as the invasion of Ukraine loomed, Western intelligence officials made the unusual decision to tell the world what they knew. For nearly a dozen days in February, a small group of intelligence officers had been going to bed early. They had seen the intelligence predicting a war and knew that if Russia was really going to invade Ukraine, it would begin in the early hours of the morning. But when the news finally came on 24 February, it still felt unreal, one recalls: ""It was hard to believe it was actually happening until I woke up early that morning and put the radio on."" For months they had been sounding the alarm. ""That day people went from 'Why are you being so hysterical?' to 'Why weren't you more hysterical?'"" says the official. There was no satisfaction in being proved right, another intelligence official adds. But at least they felt they had tried to stop a war whose scale they had been warning of for months. A member of the Ukrainian State Border Guard Service on patrol near the frontier with Russia The run-up to war and the weeks after it started saw American and British intelligence make public some of their most closely held secrets as part of an unprecedented campaign. For decades, intelligence had normally been something to share with as few individuals as possible. No longer. The decision had been taken to make the whole world know about it. This not only marked a dramatic shift in the way Western intelligence had been operating - it also meant confronting the painful legacy of the invasion of Iraq. The first signs of Russia's intentions arrived a year ago. Intelligence from satellite imagery pointed to a Russian troop build-up near Ukraine. But analysts had little understanding of Moscow's true intentions. That changed in mid-2021. ""From summer we saw a small group of senior people planning for a full military invasion of the whole country,"" explains one Western intelligence official. The intelligence-gathering and analysis was a joint US-UK affair, those involved say - one calling it a ""family"" operation. There was no single moment of understanding but rather a picture that became increasingly clear as time passed. The exact provenance of the intelligence remains classified - officials suggest it came from multiple sources. But it provided a picture which continued to build as London and Washington saw invasion plans being finalised. Western agents seek to get inside Putin's head Mystery of alleged Chinese hack on eve of Ukraine invasion Why has Russia invaded Ukraine and what does Putin want? Vladimir Putin seemed to believe he had to act quickly to fulfil his ambition of bringing Ukraine back into Russia's sphere of influence. And he believed the only way to do so was by using force. ""He felt like he had a closing window of opportunity,"" says one person who was directly involved. By autumn, Washington had decided it needed to do something with what it was being told by its spies. That decision, those involved say, was taken at the very highest level of the White House by President Biden. A crucial moment came in early November when CIA Director William Burns travelled to Moscow - to warn that Washington knew what was being planned. The trip was not kept secret. The first time some Russian officials were told that their country might be seriously intending to act against Ukraine was when they heard it from the director of the CIA, one official says. The next stage was to make some of the intelligence public. One individual involved in the discussions, who like others spoke on condition of anonymity, recalls times where it was asked: ""What is the point of knowing all of this, if we can't do something with it?"" In Washington, Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines - who briefed allies at Nato in November - and National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan are credited with pushing for the release of material. Experts on declassification, trained to understand the risks, began to work round the clock to establish what could be shared. ""The Intelligence Community surged personnel and resources to support classification reviews for increased intelligence sharing with allies and partners and declassification reviews for potential release to the public (and) leveraged its established declassification process, which is designed to protect sources and methods,"" Nicole de Haay, a spokeswoman for the US intelligence community, told the BBC. One advantage was being able to use commercially available satellite imagery to support the case. By early December, details of Russia's plans for a 175,000-strong invasion hadappeared,externalin the Washington Post. In London, the intelligence - coming in from GCHQ and MI6 - was met with near-disbelief in some quarters. A common problem inside and outside government was that people simply could not believe a major land war could break out in Europe in the 21st Century. MI6 headquarters - intelligence coming out of the agency was met with near disbelief It was only late in the year - after the material went through a formal assessment process and the Joint Intelligence Committee issued its considered view that an invasion was now ""highly likely"" - that everyone began to realise this was for real. The rigour of that process was a direct result of lessons learned nearly two decades ago when intelligence had been used to make the public case for war in Iraq in a haphazard, improvised way. In 2003, amid accusations of politicisation, the reputation of US and UK spies was damaged - especially after the intelligence proved to be wrong. The ghosts of Iraq have since haunted discussions about using intelligence in public - but Ukraine offered an opportunity to try to put that legacy to bed. New procedures had been put in place to ensure secret information went through a strict assessment process to govern how it could be used. Other allies were also briefed. But many remained sceptical. Because the source of the intelligence could not be shared it was sometimes hard to overcome this incredulity, one official says. Some European partners did not buy the analysis that Russia's build-up was anything more than bluff. A scepticism about Anglo-American intelligence was also another legacy of Iraq's missing weapons of mass destruction. France has recently sacked its head of military intelligence for failing to appreciate what was being planned. The fear for spies in publicising material is that this tips off the other side that they have a leak and potentially closes off that source. This was why, in World War Two, the UK kept the secret of Bletchley Park so tightly. There have been other occasions since Iraq when intelligence has been made public, for instance over the use of chemical weapons in Syria, but never on the scale seen over Ukraine. The release included the UK sharingdetails of Russian plansto install specific individuals as part of a puppet government in Kyiv - and Washington revealing plans by Moscow to stage pretexts for war, so-calledfalse flags, involving dead bodies whom they would falsely claim had been killed by Ukrainians. American and British spies both believe that publicising this material robbed Moscow of the ability to justify the invasion to its own people and other countries as a defensive move. One spy says of those days before the invasion that he had never seen anything like it - highly classified material would be on his desk one day and then emerge in the public domain the next. But the unprecedented outpouring of intelligence was not enough to stop the invasion. The public release had not deterred Moscow. That may never have been possible but officials believe it did disrupt Russia's plans. And it meant the reaction across the West was swifter and more unified than it might otherwise have been, they argue. They say they made it much easier for other countries to rally round tougher measures than if there had been a confused and disputed picture of who was the real aggressor. The release has continued after the invasion in speeches, statements and briefings - the head of GCHQclaimedjust over a week ago that Putin was still not getting the full picture from his own officials and there have beenwarnings,externalof possible ""false flag"" use of chemical weapons. There is also a recognition of a new world in which so-called open-source intelligence - things like commercial satellite imagery and data - has made it more possible to verify or support assertions and that fighting an information war - including through intelligence - is now vital, partly to counter Russian assertions. On one level, much of the intelligence was spot-on. There was, as forecast, a full invasion from multiple directions with the purpose of toppling and replacing the Zelensky government. Western spies also correctly predicted that Moscow had misplaced confidence about the reception it would encounter. ""They genuinely believed there would be flags out to welcome them,"" says a Western intelligence officer. But one assumption did prove wrong - that Moscow's military would prevail in a matter of weeks. Instead, the war would not turn out as many expected, with Ukraine outperforming militarily while Russia underperformed. That is a reminder that intelligence has its limits - particularly in predicting some of the complexities of war and the uncertainties of people's morale and reaction. And for all its success before the war, Western spies concede that intelligence cannot tell them for sure what will happen next.

"UK hauliers carrying perishable goods say products are losing quality and value as they are forced to sit in long queues to cross into Europe at Dover. Bad weather, Easter holidays and P&O Ferries routes being suspended have all led to congestion around the port. The queues eased on Sunday, but the British Meat Processors Association said some of its members had waited for 24 hours or more to cross. The government said traffic management measures were under regular review. However, a Department for Transport spokesperson gave no indication that there would be a change made for those transporting perishable items. As well as the other factors causing congestion, which have led to the traffic management system Operation Brock being put in place, there have also been problems with a key IT system for custom checks at the UK's busiest port after Brexit. Lockerbie-based Eardley International takes fresh meat from the UK into continental Europe, operating 25 trucks at any one time. ""Our products have a very short shelf life,"" company director Graham Eardley told the BBC. ""If we load lamb in the UK on a Monday, we'd expect to deliver that product to Germany on a Tuesday. Now we are seeing delays of 20 to 25 hours to cross the Channel, and the quality and the sale value of that product falls by every hour it is delayed."" Furthermore, haulier regulations mean drivers need to take an 11-hour break when they get to Calais, as they cannot rest while they are in the traffic jam in case they need to move their vehicle. This just adds to the problem. P&O routes are still being suspended due to a shortage of ferry services following itsdismissal of almost 800 staff last month without notice.The company says it plans to resume its operationson the Dover-Calais route next week if it gets regulatory approval. Nick Allen, chief executive of the British Meat Processors Association, said the delays meant that the UK was losing business, as customers were turning to other countries to source goods at a time when their members' products were in hot demand. ""We are told to expect disruption well into next week. With Easter weekend approaching and a very busy time for exporting fresh meat, this is really bad timing."" Graham Eardley says his company's produce loses value for every hour it is delayed For Mr Eardley, the delays mean losing up to Â£800 per truck. He says the abattoirs who use his services are also getting claims for late delivery and loss in value. ""We are paying for the driver to be sitting in the truck not being productive and seeing the loss of the revenue that the vehicle could be making."" Many in the industry argue that hauliers carrying fresh produce should be prioritised for boarding,as they have been before. The Kent Resilience Forum, which manages emergency planning for the county, said they were waiting for the government to advise them of who and what would be allowed to jump the queue. This is causing huge frustration to Mr Eardley, who says that as hauliers register customs forms listing the contents of their lorries, it should be a straightforward process to put in place. Toby Howe, the tactical lead for the forum, explained: ""It is not as simple as saying we will just fast-track meat or anything perishable. ""In 2015 we were given very general guidance and drivers got clever by putting a small amount in the lorry. For EU exit planning, Defra came up with specifics which we were then able to prioritise."" Others believe you cannot retrofit a priority system. In response, the Department for Transport (DfT) said the traffic management measures were regularly reviewed but did not say whether any changes would be made with regard to the transportation of perishable items. It said: ""P&O's unacceptable actions have resulted in its vessels being detained, causing backlogs and traffic jams which would be substantially alleviated if its fleet was operating normally. We are receiving real-time updates as the Kent Resilience Forum, police and regional leaders work around-the-clock to ease disruption and support those affected."" Trade body Logistics UK said it supported prioritising perishable goods, but said the practicalities of facilitating such a policy were currently unclear. Mags Simpson, Logistics UK's head of policy engagement, said: ""The delays are frustrating for industry and Logistics UK is working with DfT and the ports to identify effective solutions that can be introduced as soon as possible."" Shane Brennan, chief executive of the Cold Chain Federation - the trade association that represents businesses which store and move frozen and chilled food - said the poor conditions caused by Operation Brock were fanning the flames of driver shortages, in an already overstretched industry. ""The UK is getting a growing reputation for being a hassle to serve, and that creates problems for my members who can't find the hauliers to take their business because they don't want to take the risk of sitting in traffic on the M20."" Part of the frustration is that hauliers feel like tourist traffic in Dover is being prioritised over freight traffic. Mr Eardley says this further undermines morale. ""Are we saying that it's not fair to have Jimmy and Jonny delayed in their car going on holiday, but that it's acceptable to ask drivers to wait 20 hours or more in their cab? Until there is more understanding of drivers and their experience, we are on the road to ruin."" From July this year, the UK will start imposing Brexit controls on meat and dairy goods coming in from the EU. Industry leaders are concerned that this will be yet another crunch time for Dover.

"Ronaldo appeared to knock a young fan's phone to the ground as he walked down the tunnel at Goodison Merseyside Police are investigating an alleged assault after Manchester United forward Cristiano Ronaldo appeared to break a fan's phone. Footage was shared on social media alongside comments claiming he smashed the device as he left the pitch after his side's1-0 loss at Everton. Ronaldo, 37, later apologised on social media. Merseyside Police said they were investigating ""reports of an alleged assault"" at Goodison Park on Saturday. A spokesperson said they were liaising with both Manchester United and Everton. ""As players were leaving the pitch at 2.30pm, it was reported that a boy was assaulted by one of the away team as they left the pitch,"" they added. ""Inquiries are under way and officers are currently working with Everton to review CCTV footage and are carrying out extensive witness enquiries to establish if an offence has taken place. ""Anyone with information on this incident is asked to contact Merseyside Police social media desk via Twitter MerPolCC or Facebook Merseyside Police contact centre quoting reference number 228 of 9 April 2022."" Manchester United said they were aware of ""an alleged incident"" and would ""co-operate with any police inquiries"". The result damaged United's hopes of qualifying for the Champions League and came against an Everton side who had been one point above the relegation zone before kick-off. ""It's never easy to deal with emotions in difficult moments such as the one we are facing,"" said Portugal international Ronaldo. ""Nevertheless, we always have to be respectful, patient and set the example for all the youngsters who love the beautiful game.

"Extinction Rebellion activists plan to ""flood the streets of London"" for the next week Climate activists are staging a sit-down protest in the heart of London's West End shopping district, to call for no new investment in fossil fuels. Extinction Rebellion has planned protests in the capital every day until Sunday, 17 April. The Metropolitan Police said Oxford Street and Regent Street were blocked. The group said the action was intended to be ""highly disruptive"" and ""designed to disrupt, engage and recruit new rebels"". What is Extinction Rebellion and what are its aims? A really simple guide to climate change What will climate change look like near me? The Met said protesters were disrupting traffic on both streets and said it had specialist teams on standby ""to respond to any protesters who lock or glue themselves to street furniture or complicated structures"". Traffic diversions were being put in place. Extinction Rebellion spokespeople have said they want people to ""flood the streets of London"" and that they will ""create the most roadblocks we ever have with a new action design"". On Saturday, the crowd sat down across Oxford Circus and the famous streets it connects, chanting ""save our planet"" and ""whose streets? Our streets"". They carried banners that read ""I am here for nature and children"", ""navel gazing into disaster"" and ""life on earth is dying"". Extinction Rebellion billed the protest as part of ""the final push in the plan to end fossil fuels"" On Friday, two protesters from the climate movement shut down Tower Bridge by abseiling off the sides of the London landmark and unfurling a huge banner that read ""end fossil fuels now"". The bridge, a main traffic artery across the Thames, was closed to vehicles, causing long queues. London's Labour mayor Sadiq Khan said the protest was ""counter-productive"" adding that demonstrators needed to win over public opinion at the same time as putting pressure on the government.

"Chancellor Rishi Sunak's wife Akshata Murty has said she will pay UK taxes on her overseas income, following a row over her non-domicile status. She owns Â£700m in shares of the Indian IT giant Infosys, founded by her father, from which she received Â£11.6m in dividend income last year. As a non-domiciled (non-dom) UK resident she is not required by law to pay UK taxes on her overseas income. But she told the BBC she did not want to be a ""distraction"" for her husband. Her decision to change her tax arrangements follows accusations of hypocrisy against the chancellor, with opposition parties saying Mr Sunak's family is benefiting at a time when the cost of living is going up. The BBC estimates Ms Murty would have avoided Â£2.1m a year in UK tax through her non-dom status. Ms Murty said her tax arrangements had been ""entirely legal"", but added: ""It has become clear that many do not feel it is compatible with my husband's role as chancellor. ""I understand and appreciate the British sense of fairness and I do not wish my tax status to be a distraction for my husband or to affect my family."" Anon-domis someone who lives in the UK but declares their permanent home to be in another country. Sunak held US green card until last year Smearing my wife to get at me is awful, says Sunak Whatever happened to Sunak's political honeymoon? Mr Sunak has accused political opponents of ""smearing"" his wife to get at him. He has also said she is entitled to use the non-dom arrangement as she is an Indian citizen and plans to move back to her home country in the future to care for her parents. Ms Murty will retain her Indian citizenship and her non-dom status which,as the BBC revealed,allows her family to avoid paying inheritance tax in the UK - which at current valuation could amount to Â£280m. On Thursday, it emerged she pays Â£30,000 a year to maintain her non-dom status. In her statement, Ms Murty also said she would now be paying UK tax ""on all my worldwide income, including dividends and capital gains, wherever in the world that income arises"". ""I do this because I want to, not because the rules require me to. These new arrangements will begin immediately and will also be applied to the tax year just finished (2021-22),"" she added. Labour MP Louise Haigh said Mr Sunak had ""not been transparent"". The shadow transport secretary said: ""It is clear that was legal. ""I think the question many people will be asking is whether it was ethical and whether it was right that the Chancellor of the Exchequer, whilst piling on 15 separate tax rises to the British public, was benefiting from a tax scheme that allowed his household to pay significantly less to the tune of potentially tens of millions of pounds."" Lib Dem Treasury spokesperson Christine Jardine called on the Sunak household to backdate the taxes in full, adding: ""Doing something just because you've been found out isn't good enough."" While one former cabinet minister said he had ""mild sympathy"" for Mr Sunak as he had been subjected to a ""nasty ad hominem"" attack, he added that every leadership candidate, declared or otherwise, should expect this. He was naÃ¯ve if he thought families were ""off-limits for attacks"". His view was that the tax row could be as toxic for the chancellor as partygate has been for Mr Johnson. It was all about a disconnect with ordinary voters. They could not hold a children's birthday party during lockdown, but boozy get-togethers were apparently held at the heart of government. Similarly, their taxes were being put up by the chancellor, while his wife did not pay UK tax on some of her own earnings. Read Iain's full analysishere. Speaking to the Sun newspaper, Mr Sunak said it was unfair to attack his wife as she was a ""private citizen"", adding: ""I'm an elected politician. So I know what I signed up for."" It comes on the same day it was revealed thatthe couple retained their rights to live and work in the USby having green cards - which requires holders to consider America their permanent home - for more than a year after Mr Sunak became chancellor in 2020. He returned his green card in October last year, ahead of his first US trip as a UK government minister. Asked about the issue at a White House daily media briefing, press secretary Jen Psaki said it was a matter for other government departments and declined to comment. A spokeswoman for Mr Sunak said he had filed US tax returns while he held his green card ""in full compliance with the law"". Meanwhile, No 10 has rejected newspaper reports that its staff are leaking damaging stories about Mr Sunak to the media. And Prime Minister Boris Johnson told reporters at a Downing Street news conference: ""If there are such briefings, they are not coming from us in No 10, and heaven knows where they are coming from. I think that Rishi is doing an absolutely outstanding job."" A non-dom is a UK resident who declares their permanent home, or domicile, outside of the UK. A domicile is usually the country his or her father considered his permanent home when they were born, or it may be the place overseas where somebody has moved to with no intention of returning. For proof to the tax authority, non-doms have to provide evidence about their background, lifestyle and future intentions, such as where they own property or intend to be buried. Those who have the status must still pay UK tax on UK earnings but do not need to pay UK tax on foreign income. They can give up their non-dom status at any time. Ms Murty has chosen to be domiciled in India via her father, the billionaire Narayana Murty. Read morehere.

Woods, 46, is one over par after carding a 74, following an opening-round 71 in his first competitive round since a car crash 14 months ago. Fellow American Scheffler, 25, shot 67 to lead on eight under at Augusta. Scheffler, bidding for his first major win, holds a five-shot lead at the top. The US Ryder Cup star has tied the tournament record for the largest 36-hole lead. With no player blowing such an advantage since 1945, he looks primed to continue his dominant form in 2022. Scheffler has won three of his past five starts - the WGC-Dell Technologies Match Play, Arnold Palmer Invitational and Phoenix Open ""I feel my game is in a good spot,"" said Scheffler, who had not won a PGA Tour title before his three victories this year. ""I've done a good job of managing my way around the golf course. I've kept the cards pretty clean which is nice."" Afterwards, Woods said he had been in a ""grind"" at a testing Augusta National, but was happy after his astonishing comeback continued with him making the cut. ""It was a good fight, I'm in the ball game and tomorrow is a big day,"" he said. Masters leaderboard after round two Saturday's third-round pairings and tee-times How to follow the Masters on the BBC Ireland'sShane Lowrycarded a wonderful four-under 68 - only bettered on Friday by Scheffler and Justin Thomas - to sit in a four-way share of second place. Lowry, 35, almost took the position outright but saw a short birdie putt on the 18th dribble past the hole. ""It was one of the best rounds I've ever played, the conditions were difficult,"" said the 2019 Open champion. Defending championHideki Matsuyamaof Japan, South Africa's 2011 winnerCharl Schwartzeland overnight leaderIm Sung-jaeare sat alongside Lowry on three under. England'sDanny Willettstarted the day one shot off South Korea's Im and moved to the top of the leaderboard after an impressive front nine. But three successive bogeys after the turn saw the 2016 champion drop off the pace and he ended on one under after a 74. American veteranStewart Cinkclaimed the first hole-in-one of the tournament, sparking fervent celebrations when he aced the par-three 16th. This video can not be played Cink sinks hole-in-one at 16th for first ace of 2022 Masters After a stunning performance on Thursday which defied expectations, the next question surrounding 46-year-old Woods was how his body would cope with the exertions of another 18 holes on Friday. Again, the physicality of the hilly Augusta terrain - which five-time champion Woods said coming into the tournament would be his toughest opponent - appeared to provide fewer difficulties than feared. But afterwards he said: ""I'm feeling it, I'm definitely feeling it. We have some work ahead of us tonight."" Instead, it was initially the ball-striking which was not quite at the same level as it was during his opening 71. Woods started with four bogeys in his opening five holes - his worst start in 92 career rounds at the Masters - before a birdie on the eighth galvanised the 15-time major champion. It is also served to crank up the noise among the Augusta patrons, who again flocked in huge numbers to watch the former world number one. The atmosphere ramped up further when he sunk another birdie on the 10th, but Woods' progress was checked by successive bogeys on 11 and 12. They were wiped out by two more birdies on 13 and 14, with Woods annoyed at missing chances on 15 and 16 before resiliently holing out two pars to finish. While not as spectacular as his opening round, it was another encouraging performance from Woods - just 409 days after he suffered life-threatening injuries when he crashed his car while speeding in February 2021. This video can not be played 'It's a Bubba special' - Watson escapes from the woods Northern Ireland'sRory McIlroysaid after his round - before Scheffler took command later on - that he felt he was still in contention to land an elusive first Masters, despite replicating his opening 73 on Friday. McIlroy acknowledged he could be a ""few shots better"" as he bids to finally complete the career Grand Slam - eight years after his last major victory. The 32-year-old, who has won the Open, US Open, and two US PGA Championships, looked in danger of being close to the cutline after a double bogey on the newly extended par-four 11th. However, he responded superbly with two birdies in the final seven holes to ensure he did not miss the weekend at Augusta for the second successive year. ""I showed some resilience and character. My game is there,"" McIlroy told Sky Sports. ""You go out on Saturday and you play a decent front nine and all of a sudden you're right in the thick of things. ""I'm in a decent position.""

"This video can not be played Scheffler sets pace, Lowry shines and a hole-in-one - Masters day two best shots Masters 2022 second-round leaderboard -8S Scheffler (US);-3C Schwartzel (SA), H Matsuyama (Jpn), S Lowry (Ire), I Sung-Jae (Kor);-2K Na (US), D Johnson (US), H Varner III (US), C Smith (Aus) Selected others: -1J Thomas (US), C Morikawa (US), D Willett (Eng);EM Fitzpatrick (Eng);+1T Woods (US);+2L Westwood (Eng), R MacIntyre (Sco), S Garcia (Spa), T Hatton (Eng), J Rahm (Spa), R McIlroy (NI) Tiger Woods was unable to match the standard he set on his comeback as world number one Scottie Scheffler dealt with tricky winds to take a commanding halfway lead at the Masters. Woods, 46, is one over par after carding a 74, following an opening-round 71 in his first competitive round since a car crash 14 months ago. Fellow American Scheffler, 25, shot 67 to lead on eight under at Augusta. Scheffler, bidding for his first major win, holds a five-shot lead at the top. The US Ryder Cup star has tied the tournament record for the largest 36-hole lead. With no player blowing such an advantage since 1945, he looks primed to continue his dominant form in 2022. Scheffler has won three of his past five starts - the WGC-Dell Technologies Match Play, Arnold Palmer Invitational and Phoenix Open ""I feel my game is in a good spot,"" said Scheffler, who had not won a PGA Tour title before his three victories this year. ""I've done a good job of managing my way around the golf course. I've kept the cards pretty clean which is nice."" Afterwards, Woods said he had been in a ""grind"" at a testing Augusta National, but was happy after his astonishing comeback continued with him making the cut. ""It was a good fight, I'm in the ball game and tomorrow is a big day,"" he said. Masters leaderboard after round two Saturday's third-round pairings and tee-times How to follow the Masters on the BBC Ireland'sShane Lowrycarded a wonderful four-under 68 - only bettered on Friday by Scheffler and Justin Thomas - to sit in a four-way share of second place. Lowry, 35, almost took the position outright but saw a short birdie putt on the 18th dribble past the hole. ""It was one of the best rounds I've ever played, the conditions were difficult,"" said the 2019 Open champion. Defending championHideki Matsuyamaof Japan, South Africa's 2011 winnerCharl Schwartzeland overnight leaderIm Sung-jaeare sat alongside Lowry on three under. England'sDanny Willettstarted the day one shot off South Korea's Im and moved to the top of the leaderboard after an impressive front nine. But three successive bogeys after the turn saw the 2016 champion drop off the pace and he ended on one under after a 74. American veteranStewart Cinkclaimed the first hole-in-one of the tournament, sparking fervent celebrations when he aced the par-three 16th. This video can not be played Cink sinks hole-in-one at 16th for first ace of 2022 Masters After a stunning performance on Thursday which defied expectations, the next question surrounding 46-year-old Woods was how his body would cope with the exertions of another 18 holes on Friday. Again, the physicality of the hilly Augusta terrain - which five-time champion Woods said coming into the tournament would be his toughest opponent - appeared to provide fewer difficulties than feared. But afterwards he said: ""I'm feeling it, I'm definitely feeling it. We have some work ahead of us tonight."" Instead, it was initially the ball-striking which was not quite at the same level as it was during his opening 71. Woods started with four bogeys in his opening five holes - his worst start in 92 career rounds at the Masters - before a birdie on the eighth galvanised the 15-time major champion. It is also served to crank up the noise among the Augusta patrons, who again flocked in huge numbers to watch the former world number one. The atmosphere ramped up further when he sunk another birdie on the 10th, but Woods' progress was checked by successive bogeys on 11 and 12. They were wiped out by two more birdies on 13 and 14, with Woods annoyed at missing chances on 15 and 16 before resiliently holing out two pars to finish. While not as spectacular as his opening round, it was another encouraging performance from Woods - just 409 days after he suffered life-threatening injuries when he crashed his car while speeding in February 2021. This video can not be played 'It's a Bubba special' - Watson escapes from the woods Northern Ireland'sRory McIlroysaid after his round - before Scheffler took command later on - that he felt he was still in contention to land an elusive first Masters, despite replicating his opening 73 on Friday. McIlroy acknowledged he could be a ""few shots better"" as he bids to finally complete the career Grand Slam - eight years after his last major victory. The 32-year-old, who has won the Open, US Open, and two US PGA Championships, looked in danger of being close to the cutline after a double bogey on the newly extended par-four 11th. However, he responded superbly with two birdies in the final seven holes to ensure he did not miss the weekend at Augusta for the second successive year. ""I showed some resilience and character. My game is there,"" McIlroy told Sky Sports. ""You go out on Saturday and you play a decent front nine and all of a sudden you're right in the thick of things. ""I'm in a decent position.""

"Mykola was forced into a school basement with dozens of others taken from their homes at gunpoint On the white, damp wall of the Yahidne school basement is a crude calendar, drawn in red crayon. It marks a period of unimaginable trauma - from 5 March to 2 April - for the people of this village. Yahidne, 140km (80 miles) north of Kyiv and just outside the city of Chernihiv which is close to the borders with Belarus and Russia, was occupied by Russian soldiers for nearly a month. When they entered, they took men, women and children from their homes at gunpoint and held them in the basement of the local school for four weeks - around 130 people cramped into a room roughly 65 sq m (700 sq ft) in size. Sixty-year-old Mykola Klymchuk was one of them. He offered to show us the basement. As we climbed down a short flight of stairs, we began to smell the stench of disease and decay. The room was dirty - some mattresses, clothes, shoes and books were strewn on the floor, there were four small cots in the centre and a stash of utensils in one corner. Mykola took us straight to the far end of the room. ""This was my half a metre of space. I was sleeping standing up,"" he said. His voice choked up and he started crying. ""I tied myself to the railing here with my scarf so I wouldn't fall over. I spent 25 nights like this."" This video can not be played Watch: Mykola tied himself to a wall so he could sleep standing up Mykola said you couldn't move at all for fear of stepping on people. About 40 or 50 children were among those held captive, including babies. The youngest was just two months old. Russian forces were quick to reach villages such as Yahidne as they launched their assault on Chernihiv. For weeks the city of about 300,000 people was cut off as Russian forces surrounded and bombed it, having met resistance. They also destroyed a bridge on the road to the capital Kyiv, leaving residents with nowhere to flee. Now the Russians have withdrawn following their failure to take Kyiv. The BBC is one of the first news organisations to reach the area and the horror of what happened under both occupation and bombardment can be revealed. So close to the border, people worry too that the Russians could soon return. About 130 people spent four weeks here Fifteen-year-old Anastasiia was in the Yahidne basement along with her father and grandmother. ""There was barely any room. We were living sitting up. We were sleeping sitting up. Not that we slept at all. It was impossible. So many shells were landing around here. It was unbearable,"" she said. The room had no ventilation. Its two windows were boarded up. ""During my time here, 12 people died,"" Mykola said. Most of them were elderly people. It's unclear what they died of, but Mykola believes some suffocated to death. When people died, the bodies couldn't immediately be removed. Russian soldiers would not allow it every day. And because of the constant fighting outside - mortar shelling, explosions and gunfire - it was dangerous as well. This meant that people, including children, lived amidst corpses for hours, and sometimes days, until they could be taken outside. Anastasiia is scared and clearly suffering from the stress of weeks under siege ""It was very scary. I knew the people who died,"" says Anastasiia. ""They treated us very kindly. I felt so sad, they just died here for no reason."" ""In normal conditions, they would not have died. Putin is a war criminal,"" said Mykola. ""My feet had begun to swell up. But I kept thinking to myself, I have to survive. I have to, for my daughter and two granddaughters."" Most of the time people were not allowed to go out even to use a toilet. They were made to use buckets instead. ""Sometimes the soldiers took people out to use them as shields,"" Mykola said. They were allowed to cook on open fires outside twice a day. The village had enough food stocks and a well for water. One of the Russian soldiers told Mykola they had been told they would be in Ukraine for just four days, which would be enough to take over Kyiv. On 3 April, the Russians withdrew from Yahidne. Ukrainian soldiers are now in the village, and most of those who were trapped have been evacuated to areas nearby. ""I wake up many times every night. I feel like I can hear the sound of shooting. I run to my parents, scared,"" says Anastasiia. The Russians occupied villages like Yahidne around Chernihiv in a bid to lay siege to the city and eventually take control of it. They weren't able to enter the city, but there's been extensive destruction to many parts of it and officials say around 350 civilians have been killed. Air strikes destroyed Chernihiv apartment blocks Since Russia's withdrawal from around Chernihiv, volunteers have been burying the dead. One part of the local graveyard is now entirely full of fresh graves, with a placard stuck in each, for the purpose of identification. Families who have been separated have been coming to see if they can find the grave of their loved ones. A local football stadium was bombed, Ukrainian officials say by Russian aircraft. A giant crater can be seen in the centre of the field where one bomb fell. Another destroyed a part of the stands, now a mangled mess of broken plastic seats and metal railings. Next to the stadium, a children's library housed in a historic building has also been badly damaged. As we drove through the city, we passed several residential neighbourhoods which have been almost flattened. Some Chernihiv neighbourhoods have been flattened At Novoselivka, in the north of Chernihiv, destruction is visible as far as the eye can see. Piles of stones and bricks lie where homes must have stood. We saw a child's pink winter jacket, a teddy bear, a stuffed elephant and pieces of Lego on one of the paths going into the residential area. Along the way, we saw more bomb craters. A woman and child on bicycles gestured to us to follow them. Sixty-two-year-old Nina Vynnyk and her grandson, 10-year-old Danylo, wanted to show us their home -  only a shell now, everything in and around it has been destroyed. ""There is nothing left,"" says Nina Nina's daughter and Danylo's mother, 39-year-old Ludmyla, has lost her leg and is in hospital. When Nina's home began to be shelled, they ran to another person's house hoping to seek shelter in their basement. But that was bombed too. ""We were knocked out by the explosion. Someone got a concussion, someone was injured. When we came to our senses, I saw that my daughter was screaming, 'Mummy, mummy I don't have a leg'. It was horrible,"" she said. Ludmyla crawled to safety and was taken to a hospital. ""I feel like this is a terrible nightmare. It can't be true. Why didn't our government warn us? Why didn't they evacuate us,"" said Nina. Four generations of her family lived in the home. ""In one moment, there is nothing left. I don't know where I will live in the winter,"" she said. She can't afford to pay for prosthetics for her daughter. On Russian statements that they have not targeted civilians, she says, ""He [Putin] is full of lies. There is a woman in a hospital without a leg. That is the truth. ""Let Putin pay for her surgery. Let Putin build this house. He wanted it so much, didn't he? Let him pay for all of it now.""

"Yuliia, left, and her mother Tatiana, described how bodies lay in the streets of Mariupol Civilians who have managed to flee Mariupol in recent days have described the increasingly desperate situation inside the besieged city, including accounts of bodies buried in shallow graves, looting by Chechen fighters, and starving residents being killed when they venture out of shelters to find water. The evacuees' accounts are emerging as they reach the town of Zaporizhzhia which is acting as a hub for refugees. They have risked journeys through Russian and Ukrainian lines that the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) describes as an evacuation ""from hell"". Waiting inside one aid facility was Yuliia, with her two daughters and her mother Tatiana. They finally managed to escape the city on Monday. ""There are starving people,"" said Yuliia, who spoke to the BBC on condition that her surname was not used, a frequent request from residents still concerned about their safety. ""People are having mental breakdowns. There is a woman we knew who hanged herself. People are being buried in the streets."" Her mother Tatiana said:  ""[There are] shallow graves, half a metre deep at best, with some earth on top. Dead bodies, all over the streets."" They said many of those with no choice but to remain in basements or wrecked apartment buildings are ""the incapacitated"" - a reference to elderly and disabled people. ""People were starvingâ¦ There was no re-supply. There was no humanitarian aid whatsoever. We were cooking whatever we could on bonfires. No water, no gas, no electricity, no power,"" said Yuliia. Their family survived underground for a month as Tatiana rationed the only food they had. ""Whatever we had in our fridges [when the invasion began], some porridge and butter, that's it. We were just bringing water from a well 3km away,"" Tatiana said. Many who managed to flee from Mariupol found themselves at aid stations in Zaporizhzhia Her other daughter's family have not been able to leave the city. ""There is no communication. We don't know what's happened to our relatives,"" she said. This week, the UK Ministry of Defence warned that the humanitarian crisis was deepening as fierce fighting continued for control of the city and Russian forces blocked aid. The chances of getting out diminished quickly for many residents, according to the accounts to the BBC. As the full extent of the siege took hold in early March, Russian-made Grad rockets ""destroyed a lot of cars"", said Yuliia. ""When we were in Mariupol, Chechens were looting. They were taking people's gold. It was becoming really dangerous, we heard they were raping women,"" she said. ""I was frightened for my kids and I realised we had to get them out in any way possible"". The BBC cannot independently verify the claims. Chechen militants loyal to Moscow have been fighting in Ukraine since the start of the invasion and are reported to have been heavily involved in the siege of Mariupol. Elsewhere in Zaporizhzhia, aid workers have been finding homes and handing out money for evacuated families. Putin demands Mariupol surrender to end shelling Mariupol's refugees carry wounds of battered city At one refugee staging centre, Liubov, aged 61, was waiting with her son Valerii. She had a picture of their apartment block, eviscerated by shelling or an airstrike. ""On some days [there were] 50 planes, on other days 70. Each carrying two bombs. They were hitting the drama theatre, museums, hotels, apartment buildings. They didn't discriminate at all."" When the water supply stopped, Luibov said people had to choose between nothing to drink or a deadly venture outside. Trips for water are laden with danger; Luibov says one man who did so never came back ""Those people who tried to get water got killed. Some people managed to bring small amounts of water for cooking,"" she said. ""We didn't have any water [for weeks]... A man went to get some, he didn't come back."" She said there were up to 300 people in some shelters. ""Russians would take them out from those shelters, take photos of those people and say, 'we came here to liberate you'. People were crying, scared to say anything back. Scared they might get executed or shot. ""The Russians would say: 'See, these are the tears of joy. People are happy to be free from the fascists'."" In the refugee staging centre, Liubov wept as she displayed the pictures on her phone, returning again and again to Mariupol's nightmare: the need for mass burials of the dead. Why Mariupol is so important to Russia's plan 'Russian soldiers held us as human shields' ""They bombed and destroyed Mariupol central market, so people dug a hole in the ground where they would be bringing bodies,"" she said. ""We were told they would be buried there. But we still don't know if that happened."" Liubov and Valerii managed to escape on 19 March. They reached the city of Melekino, also under Russian control, and were searched at a checkpoint where Valerii said the soldiers made him undress. All the men in the centre reported the same thing. Russian soldiers looking for fighters strip them to their underwear searching for tattoos or rifle butt marks on men's shoulders. Mariupol lies in ruins, as seen in this photo of a local resident on 4 April On Wednesday, eight buses carrying evacuees were escorted by the ICRC into Zaporizhzhia. The arrivals had all the belongings they could carry. They looked exhausted and shell-shocked. Some said the communication collapse in Mariupol is so bad they spent weeks not knowing whether the rest of the country had fallen to the Russians. One of the first off the buses was Anna. She had made her own way to the town of Berdyansk about 50 miles (80km) away, the closest the ICRC buses could get to Mariupol. ""Mariupol is a graveyard now. All the neighbourhoods are covered in the graves of civilians,"" she said. ""It was terrifying. People were sourcing water from a well."" ""Unfortunately, not everybody got out. We have relatives in Mariupol who we haven't had communications with since the end of February. We don't know if they are alive or not,"" she added. Anna described her city as a ""graveyard"" Moscow claims it has evacuated civilians held by ""Nazi battalion fighters"" in Mariupol. Ukraine says up to 40,000 people have been forcibly deported to Russia, with some held in ""filtration camps"" where they are investigated. Many people have lost contact with close relatives and have no way of knowing whether they have survived. Yevhenii Lysenko was also waiting at a refugee centre in Zaporizhzhia. He left Mariupol for a work trip before the war started. The invasion happened the day he was due to return home. This video can not be played Watch: Drone footage shows extent of devastation in the city of Mariupol He is stuck in Zaporizhzhia, and hasn't heard from his wife Svetlana since their last contact in early March. ""The message [from her] was we're being bombed,"" he said. He scrolled through pages of text messages to his wife, asking where she was, whether she was safe. ""Last time I talked to her was 2 March. So for over a month I haven't spoken to her. I don't know what happened to her. I don't know whether she's alive."" He had considered trying to make a trip to Mariupol, back across Russian lines. ""[But] if I get caught by the separatists they're going to hand me a rifle and tell me to go and shoot my own peopleâ¦ or execute me if I refuse to do that,"" he said. I asked what he knows about his home. He replied: ""It doesn't exist anymore, it's been destroyed by shelling or an airstrike. So essentially there is nowhere for me to return to.""

Woods, 46, is one over par after carding a 74, following an opening-round 71 in his first competitive round since a car crash 14 months ago. Fellow American Scheffler, 25, shot 67 to lead on eight under at Augusta. Scheffler, bidding for his first major win, holds a five-shot lead at the top. The US Ryder Cup star has tied the tournament record for the largest 36-hole lead. With no player blowing such an advantage since 1945, he looks primed to continue his dominant form in 2022. Scheffler has won three of his past five starts - the WGC-Dell Technologies Match Play, Arnold Palmer Invitational and Phoenix Open ""I feel my game is in a good spot,"" said Scheffler, who had not won a PGA Tour title before his three victories this year. ""I've done a good job of managing my way around the golf course. I've kept the cards pretty clean which is nice."" Afterwards, Woods said he had been in a ""grind"" at a testing Augusta National, but was happy after his astonishing comeback continued with him making the cut. ""It was a good fight, I'm in the ball game and tomorrow is a big day,"" he said. Masters leaderboard after round two Saturday's third-round pairings and tee-times How to follow the Masters on the BBC Ireland'sShane Lowrycarded a wonderful four-under 68 - only bettered on Friday by Scheffler and Justin Thomas - to sit in a four-way share of second place. Lowry, 35, almost took the position outright but saw a short birdie putt on the 18th dribble past the hole. ""It was one of the best rounds I've ever played, the conditions were difficult,"" said the 2019 Open champion. Defending championHideki Matsuyamaof Japan, South Africa's 2011 winnerCharl Schwartzeland overnight leaderIm Sung-jaeare sat alongside Lowry on three under. England'sDanny Willettstarted the day one shot off South Korea's Im and moved to the top of the leaderboard after an impressive front nine. But three successive bogeys after the turn saw the 2016 champion drop off the pace and he ended on one under after a 74. American veteranStewart Cinkclaimed the first hole-in-one of the tournament, sparking fervent celebrations when he aced the par-three 16th. This video can not be played Cink sinks hole-in-one at 16th for first ace of 2022 Masters After a stunning performance on Thursday which defied expectations, the next question surrounding 46-year-old Woods was how his body would cope with the exertions of another 18 holes on Friday. Again, the physicality of the hilly Augusta terrain - which five-time champion Woods said coming into the tournament would be his toughest opponent - appeared to provide fewer difficulties than feared. But afterwards he said: ""I'm feeling it, I'm definitely feeling it. We have some work ahead of us tonight."" Instead, it was initially the ball-striking which was not quite at the same level as it was during his opening 71. Woods started with four bogeys in his opening five holes - his worst start in 92 career rounds at the Masters - before a birdie on the eighth galvanised the 15-time major champion. It is also served to crank up the noise among the Augusta patrons, who again flocked in huge numbers to watch the former world number one. The atmosphere ramped up further when he sunk another birdie on the 10th, but Woods' progress was checked by successive bogeys on 11 and 12. They were wiped out by two more birdies on 13 and 14, with Woods annoyed at missing chances on 15 and 16 before resiliently holing out two pars to finish. While not as spectacular as his opening round, it was another encouraging performance from Woods - just 409 days after he suffered life-threatening injuries when he crashed his car while speeding in February 2021.

McIlroy acknowledged he could be a ""few shots better"" as he bids to finally complete the career Grand Slam - eight years after his last major victory. The 32-year-old, who has won the Open, US Open, and two US PGA Championships, looked in danger of being close to the cutline after a double bogey on the newly extended par-four 11th. However, he responded superbly with two birdies in the final seven holes to ensure he did not miss the weekend at Augusta for the second successive year. ""I showed some resilience and character. My game is there,"" McIlroy told Sky Sports. ""You go out on Saturday and you play a decent front nine and all of a sudden you're right in the thick of things. ""I'm in a decent position."" England'sMatt Fitzpatrickplayed with McIlroy in the opening two rounds and, following a one-over 73 on Friday, is two shots better off than his European Ryder Cup team-mate at level par.

Fellow ScotRobert MacIntyrecontinued his impressive record of making the cut in every major he has played in by carding another 73 to sit two over. MacIntyre, 25, has reached the weekend in all eight of his major appearances. ""It's a brilliant record to have. You never want to miss a cut in a major,"" he said. ""It's brilliant to know that my game stands up in the toughest of tests against the best players. The left-hander, who finished 12th on his Masters debut last year, played solidly during Friday's second round and plans to ""take the reins off"" at the weekend. ""I'm in a good spot. I'm playing solid, I'm putting it decent. I've just not had any magic yet,"" he added. English pairLee WestwoodandTyrrell Hattonare also two over at the halfway stage, while compatriotTommy Fleetwood(+3) is the only other British player to make the cut. Justin Rose,the 2017 runner-up, missed the weekend after shooting another 76 and, another Englishman, amateurLaird Shepherd,propped up the leaderboard at 22 over on his Augusta debut.

"Satellite image of Luninets airfield, Belarus, during the build-up to Russia's attack on Ukraine Traditionally, it is the job of a spy to keep secrets - but as the invasion of Ukraine loomed, Western intelligence officials made the unusual decision to tell the world what they knew. For nearly a dozen days in February, a small group of intelligence officers had been going to bed early. They had seen the intelligence predicting a war and knew that if Russia was really going to invade Ukraine, it would begin in the early hours of the morning. But when the news finally came on 24 February, it still felt unreal, one recalls: ""It was hard to believe it was actually happening until I woke up early that morning and put the radio on."" For months they had been sounding the alarm. ""That day people went from 'Why are you being so hysterical?' to 'Why weren't you more hysterical?'"" says the official. There was no satisfaction in being proved right, another intelligence official adds. But at least they felt they had tried to stop a war whose scale they had been warning of for months. A member of the Ukrainian State Border Guard Service on patrol near the frontier with Russia The run-up to war and the weeks after it started saw American and British intelligence make public some of their most closely held secrets as part of an unprecedented campaign. For decades, intelligence had normally been something to share with as few individuals as possible. No longer. The decision had been taken to make the whole world know about it. This not only marked a dramatic shift in the way Western intelligence had been operating - it also meant confronting the painful legacy of the invasion of Iraq. The first signs of Russia's intentions arrived a year ago. Intelligence from satellite imagery pointed to a Russian troop build-up near Ukraine. But analysts had little understanding of Moscow's true intentions. That changed in mid-2021. ""From summer we saw a small group of senior people planning for a full military invasion of the whole country,"" explains one Western intelligence official. The intelligence-gathering and analysis was a joint US-UK affair, those involved say - one calling it a ""family"" operation. There was no single moment of understanding but rather a picture that became increasingly clear as time passed. The exact provenance of the intelligence remains classified - officials suggest it came from multiple sources. But it provided a picture which continued to build as London and Washington saw invasion plans being finalised. Western agents seek to get inside Putin's head Mystery of alleged Chinese hack on eve of Ukraine invasion Why has Russia invaded Ukraine and what does Putin want? Vladimir Putin seemed to believe he had to act quickly to fulfil his ambition of bringing Ukraine back into Russia's sphere of influence. And he believed the only way to do so was by using force. ""He felt like he had a closing window of opportunity,"" says one person who was directly involved. By autumn, Washington had decided it needed to do something with what it was being told by its spies. That decision, those involved say, was taken at the very highest level of the White House by President Biden. A crucial moment came in early November when CIA Director William Burns travelled to Moscow - to warn that Washington knew what was being planned. The trip was not kept secret. The first time some Russian officials were told that their country might be seriously intending to act against Ukraine was when they heard it from the director of the CIA, one official says. The next stage was to make some of the intelligence public. One individual involved in the discussions, who like others spoke on condition of anonymity, recalls times where it was asked: ""What is the point of knowing all of this, if we can't do something with it?"" In Washington, Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines - who briefed allies at Nato in November - and National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan are credited with pushing for the release of material. Experts on declassification, trained to understand the risks, began to work round the clock to establish what could be shared. ""The Intelligence Community surged personnel and resources to support classification reviews for increased intelligence sharing with allies and partners and declassification reviews for potential release to the public (and) leveraged its established declassification process, which is designed to protect sources and methods,"" Nicole de Haay, a spokeswoman for the US intelligence community, told the BBC. One advantage was being able to use commercially available satellite imagery to support the case. By early December, details of Russia's plans for a 175,000-strong invasion hadappeared,externalin the Washington Post. In London, the intelligence - coming in from GCHQ and MI6 - was met with near-disbelief in some quarters. A common problem inside and outside government was that people simply could not believe a major land war could break out in Europe in the 21st Century. MI6 headquarters - intelligence coming out of the agency was met with near disbelief It was only late in the year - after the material went through a formal assessment process and the Joint Intelligence Committee issued its considered view that an invasion was now ""highly likely"" - that everyone began to realise this was for real. The rigour of that process was a direct result of lessons learned nearly two decades ago when intelligence had been used to make the public case for war in Iraq in a haphazard, improvised way. In 2003, amid accusations of politicisation, the reputation of US and UK spies was damaged - especially after the intelligence proved to be wrong. The ghosts of Iraq have since haunted discussions about using intelligence in public - but Ukraine offered an opportunity to try to put that legacy to bed. New procedures had been put in place to ensure secret information went through a strict assessment process to govern how it could be used. Other allies were also briefed. But many remained sceptical. Because the source of the intelligence could not be shared it was sometimes hard to overcome this incredulity, one official says. Some European partners did not buy the analysis that Russia's build-up was anything more than bluff. A scepticism about Anglo-American intelligence was also another legacy of Iraq's missing weapons of mass destruction. France has recently sacked its head of military intelligence for failing to appreciate what was being planned. The fear for spies in publicising material is that this tips off the other side that they have a leak and potentially closes off that source. This was why, in World War Two, the UK kept the secret of Bletchley Park so tightly. There have been other occasions since Iraq when intelligence has been made public, for instance over the use of chemical weapons in Syria, but never on the scale seen over Ukraine. The release included the UK sharingdetails of Russian plansto install specific individuals as part of a puppet government in Kyiv - and Washington revealing plans by Moscow to stage pretexts for war, so-calledfalse flags, involving dead bodies whom they would falsely claim had been killed by Ukrainians. American and British spies both believe that publicising this material robbed Moscow of the ability to justify the invasion to its own people and other countries as a defensive move. One spy says of those days before the invasion that he had never seen anything like it - highly classified material would be on his desk one day and then emerge in the public domain the next. But the unprecedented outpouring of intelligence was not enough to stop the invasion. The public release had not deterred Moscow. That may never have been possible but officials believe it did disrupt Russia's plans. And it meant the reaction across the West was swifter and more unified than it might otherwise have been, they argue. They say they made it much easier for other countries to rally round tougher measures than if there had been a confused and disputed picture of who was the real aggressor. The release has continued after the invasion in speeches, statements and briefings - the head of GCHQclaimedjust over a week ago that Putin was still not getting the full picture from his own officials and there have beenwarnings,externalof possible ""false flag"" use of chemical weapons. There is also a recognition of a new world in which so-called open-source intelligence - things like commercial satellite imagery and data - has made it more possible to verify or support assertions and that fighting an information war - including through intelligence - is now vital, partly to counter Russian assertions. On one level, much of the intelligence was spot-on. There was, as forecast, a full invasion from multiple directions with the purpose of toppling and replacing the Zelensky government. Western spies also correctly predicted that Moscow had misplaced confidence about the reception it would encounter. ""They genuinely believed there would be flags out to welcome them,"" says a Western intelligence officer. But one assumption did prove wrong - that Moscow's military would prevail in a matter of weeks. Instead, the war would not turn out as many expected, with Ukraine outperforming militarily while Russia underperformed. That is a reminder that intelligence has its limits - particularly in predicting some of the complexities of war and the uncertainties of people's morale and reaction. And for all its success before the war, Western spies concede that intelligence cannot tell them for sure what will happen next.

McIlroy acknowledged he could be a ""few shots better"" as he bids to finally complete the career Grand Slam - eight years after his last major victory. The 32-year-old, who has won the Open, US Open, and two US PGA Championships, looked in danger of being close to the cutline after a double bogey on the newly extended par-four 11th. However, he responded superbly with two birdies in the final seven holes to ensure he did not miss the weekend at Augusta for the second successive year. ""I showed some resilience and character. My game is there,"" McIlroy told Sky Sports. ""You go out on Saturday and you play a decent front nine and all of a sudden you're right in the thick of things. ""I'm in a decent position."" England'sMatt Fitzpatrickplayed with McIlroy in the opening two rounds and, following a one-over 73 on Friday, is two shots better off than his European Ryder Cup team-mate at level par.

Playing in the 100th major championship of his career, the 64-year-old shot a 76 to finish 14 over and miss the cut for the eighth straight year. Fellow ScotRobert MacIntyrecontinued his impressive record of making the cut in every major he has played in by carding another 73 to sit two over. MacIntyre, 25, has reached the weekend in all eight of his major appearances. ""It's a brilliant record to have. You never want to miss a cut in a major,"" he said. ""It's brilliant to know that my game stands up in the toughest of tests against the best players. The left-hander, who finished 12th on his Masters debut last year, played solidly during Friday's second round and plans to ""take the reins off"" at the weekend. ""I'm in a good spot. I'm playing solid, I'm putting it decent. I've just not had any magic yet,"" he added. English pairLee WestwoodandTyrrell Hattonare also two over at the halfway stage, while compatriotTommy Fleetwood(+3) is the only other British player to make the cut. Justin Rose,the 2017 runner-up, missed the weekend after shooting another 76 and, another Englishman, amateurLaird Shepherd,propped up the leaderboard at 22 over on his Augusta debut.
