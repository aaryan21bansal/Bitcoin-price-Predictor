Bernie Sanders and Pete Buttigieg, the two current frontrunners, have an age difference of four decades - Sanders is more than double his rival's age. In his speech in the past hour, Buttigieg mentioned admiring Sanders while he was in high school. Buttigieg was born in 1982. At that time, Sanders was the mayor of Burlington, Vermont - a post he'd hold from 1981 to 1989. When Buttigieg was graduating high school at age 18 in 2000, Sanders was a member of the US House of Representatives. That same year, Buttigiegwon an award for writing an essay about Bernie Sanders,externalwhere he called him an ""outstanding and inspiring example"" of integrity. ""In a climate where even liberalism is considered radical, and Socialism is immediately and perhaps willfully confused with Communism, a politician dares to call himself a socialist? He does indeed."" Buttigieg became South Bend, Indiana, mayor in 2012 - at which point Sanders was in his second term as senator. They're the first states in America to host a caucus and primary election in the long road to the presidency. The states have a decent record for picking the eventual Democratic nominee. So far, they've opted for Pete Buttigieg and Bernie Sanders. Those states' records are a bit more spotty when it comes to picking Republicans. Five out of seven final candidates have won New Hampshire since 1976 and in Iowa, just two since 1980. The 2016 Democratic National Convention had many balloons Clinching victory in New Hampshire by just 2%, Bernie Sanders has currently gained eight delegates from the Granite State, and Pete Buttigieg has seven. So after one caucus and (most of) one primary, where are we sitting with delegate totals?  (This number will change once the final result from New Hampshire comes in) While New Hampshire and Iowa are important for momentum, it's worth remembering they make a small dent in the total delegate count:1,991 delegatesare required for a candidate to become the Democratic White House nominee.

Iowa and New Hampshire don't matter for the numbers, they matter for the symbolism: first in the nation caucus, first in the nation primary. Bernie Sanders has got some momentum but I don't think this is quite as impressive a victory as he won four years ago. Anthony ZurcherBBC News, New Hampshire Four
years ago, Bernie Sanders took the New Hampshire primary with 60% of the vote.
He wonât come close to that mark this time, but given the depth of the field
the achievement is equally impressive. Whatâs
more, the order of the finishers helps Sanders as well. Biden â the only
candidate he trails in national polling - is wounded, perhaps mortally so. Pete
Buttigieg finished a strong second, but his success outside the first two
states is still an open question. Warren, his closest rival for the liberal
left vote, has yet to prove she can finish near Sanders. Amy Klobucharâs
success ensures sheâll stick around and the moderate support will remain
splintered. Four
years ago, Sanders hit an electoral brick wall after New Hampshire. With plenty
of money, a battle-tested national campaign organisation and divided
opposition, his path ahead - while far from certain - looks the brightest of
any in the field.

""The reason we are going to win is that we are putting together and unprecedented, multigenerational, multiracial political movement."" He adds that he is taking on billionaires and candidates funded by billionaires, honing in on the key issues of healthcare and the economy. Bernie Sanders is all smiles as he thanks the crowd of supporters cheering his name for their ""great victory tonight"". ""The reason we won tonight in New Hampshire, that we won last week in Iowa, is because of the hard work of so many volunteers,"" Sanders said.

Two candidates - Andrew Yang and Michael Bennet - dropped out on Tuesday.

"New powers will be given to the watchdog Ofcom to force social media firms to act over harmful content. Until now, firms like Facebook, Tiktok, YouTube, Snapchat and Twitter have largely been self-regulating. The companies have defended their own rules about taking down unacceptable content, but critics say independent rules are needed to keep people safe. It is unclear what penalties Ofcom will be able to enforce to target violence, cyber-bullying and child abuse. There have been widespread calls for social media firms to take more responsibility for their content, especially afterthe death of Molly Russellwho took her own life after viewing graphic content on Instagram. The government has now announced it is ""minded""  to grant new powers to Ofcom - which currently only regulates the media and the telecoms industry, not internet safety. How can governments regulate social media? Doctors demand social media firms hand over data Molly Russell: Instagram bans self-harm drawings Ofcom will have the power to make tech firms responsible for protecting people from harmful content such as violence, terrorism, cyber-bullying and child abuse - and platforms will need to ensure that content is removed quickly. They will also be expected to ""minimise the risks"" of it appearing at all. The regulator has just announced the appointment of a new chief executive, Dame Melanie Dawes, who will take up the role in March. Molly Russell's family found she had been accessing distressing material about depression and suicide on Instagram ""There are many platforms who ideally would not have wanted regulation, but I think that's changing,"" said Digital Secretary Baroness Nicky Morgan. ""I think they understand now that actually regulation is coming."" Julian Knight, chair elect of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee which scrutinises social media companies, called for ""a muscular approach"" to regulation. ""That means more than a hefty fine - it means having the clout to disrupt the activities of businesses that fail to comply, and ultimately, the threat of a prison sentence for breaking the law,"" he said. In a statement, Facebook said it had ""long called"" for new regulation, and said it was ""looking forward to carrying on the discussion"" with the government and wider industry. Communication watchdog Ofcom already regulates television and radio broadcasters, including the BBC, and deals with complaints about them. This is the government's first response to the Online Harms consultation it carried out in the UK in 2019, which received 2,500 replies. The new rules will apply to firms hosting user-generated content, including comments, forums and video-sharing - that is likely to include Facebook, Snapchat, Twitter, YouTube and TikTok. The intention is that government sets the direction of the policy but gives Ofcom the freedom to draw up and adapt the details. By doing this, the watchdog should have the ability to tackle new online threats as they emerge without the need for further legislation. A full response will be published in the spring. Children's charity the NSPCC welcomed the news. ""Too many times social media companies have said: 'We don't like the idea of children being abused on our sites, we'll do something, leave it to us,'"" said chief executive Peter Wanless. ""Thirteen self-regulatory attempts to keep children safe online have failed. ""Statutory regulation is essential."" Seyi Akiwowo set up the campaign group Glitch after experiencing online harassment. Seyi Akiwowo set up the online abuse awareness group Glitch after experiencing sexist and racist harassment online after a video of her giving a talk in her role as a councillor was posted on a neo-Nazi forum. ""When I first suffered abuse the response of the tech companies was below [what I'd hoped],"" she said. ""I am excited by the Online Harms Bill - it places the duty of care on these multi-billion pound tech companies."" UK plans social media and internet watchdog In many countries, social media platforms are permitted to regulate themselves, as long as they adhere to local laws on illegal material. Germany introduced the NetzDG Law in 2018, which states that social media platforms with more than two million registered German users have to review and remove illegal content within 24 hours of being posted or face fines of up to â¬50m (Â£42m). Australia passed the Sharing of Abhorrent Violent Material Act in April 2019, introducing criminal penalties for social media companies, possible jail sentences for tech executives for up to three years and financial penalties worth up to 10% of a company's global turnover. China blocks many western tech giants including Twitter, Google and Facebook, and the state monitors Chinese social apps for politically sensitive content.

Heading to South Carolina tonight shows just how badly he has been doing. Articulating a clear message for why he wants to win in 2020 has been much more problematic than it has been for Sanders. About two-thirds of the New Hampshire votes are in - so where are we? Bernie Sandersis holding on to his lead with 26% of the vote, followed closely byPete Buttigieg, who has 24%. This is a difference of about5,000 votes- the gap has narrowed quite a bit over the past half-hour. Just behind them sitsAmy Klobuchar, at 20%. The three leaders are trailed byElizabeth Warren(9%),Joe Biden(8%) andTom Steyer(4%). Only the top three are on track to claim any delegates. Â© 2025 BBC.

"The Splash has been in private ownership since 2006 One of British artist David Hockney's most famous works, The Splash, has been sold for Â£23.1m at Sotheby's in London. The buyer is not known. It had been estimated to sell for Â£20m-Â£30m - and ended up going for Â£23,117,000. The painting, in Hockney's minimalist style, depicts the moment after a diver hits the water in an LA swimming pool. It is considered one of the stand-out pop art images of the 20th Century and is one of a trio of works alongside A Little Splash and A Bigger Splash. The bewitching allure of Hockney's swimming pools A Bigger Splash is housed in London's Tate Britain while A Little Splash remains in a private collection and has never appeared on the public market. ""Not only is this a landmark work within David Hockney's oeuvre, it's an icon of Pop that defined an era and also gave a visual identity to LA,"" Emma Baker, head of Sotheby's contemporary art evening sale, said in a statement. When it was previously sold to a private owner in 2006 it went for Â£2.9m - a then record price for a Hockney work - and it has remained with that buyer until now. Prior to that, the Â£1.9m sale of A Neat Lawn, also in 2006, had set a precedent for a Hockney. David Hockney was inspired to create his Splash series by his early years in Los Angeles Since then, the growinginterest among the most wealthy in the value-holding investment benefits of high-end contemporary art,externalhave seen auction prices climb. This was illustrated at a 2018 auction at Christie's in New York where Hockney's Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures) sold for just over $90m (Â£70m) - an auction record at the time for a work by a living artist. It's since been beatenby the $91.1m (Â£70.3m) sale in 2019 of a sculpture by US pop artist Jeff Koons. In May 2018, Hockney's Pacific Coast Highway and Santa Monica sold for $28.5m (Â£22m) - which was more than double the previous auction record for the artist. The Splash captures the brief moment just seconds after a swimmer has broken the calm surface of a pool. The painting's protagonist is present, yet absent, hidden by the displaced water. The work is a classic example of Hockney's lifelong fascination with the texture, appearance and depth of water. The Splash series was inspired by the time Hockney spent in Los Angeles following his graduation from art school. He first visited the Californian city in 1964. On returning to London later that year, he began to work on his first pool painting, Picture of a Hollywood Swimming Pool, which fetched $7.2m (Â£5.6m) at an auction at Sotheby's New York in November 2019. In 1966, he went back to Los Angeles and moved into an apartment in the city. It was there that Hockney, in his new sun-soaked environment, created the Splash paintings between 1966 and 1967.

"Challenger bank N26 is closing accounts for UK customers on 15 April, blaming difficulties created by the Brexit process. The bank, which had a significant marketing push after launch, only started offering current accounts in the UK after the EU referendum. However, it said that the ""timing and framework"" of the Withdrawal Agreement made it impossible to continue. With about 200,000 customers, it was one of the smaller operators in the UK. Thomas Grosse, chief banking officer at N26, which has a European banking licence, said: ""While we respect the political decision that has been taken, it means that N26 will be unable to serve our customers in the UK and will have to leave the market."" Accounts will operate as normal until 15 April, by which time funds should be transferred. Will Sorby, general manager for N26 in the UK, said that accounts would be closed automatically on that date after money has been removed. Anyone who has money in an account and fails to move it in time will see the cash shifted into a holding account. Following the closure of the company's UK operations, the majority of its UK staff would move into new roles within the business, the bank said. It is bigger in Germany, where it has its Berlin headquarters, and has recently launched in the US. The move comes on the day that shadow chancellor John McDonnell has said he fears there's a ""risk"" of an exodus from the City if the government does not get a swift deal with the EU on financial services. However, there are no signs as yet of any other challenger or bigger banks following N26 in quitting the UK. Monzo and Starling have a UK banking licence, unlike N26. It remains tough for challenger banks in the UK current account sector, primarily because a large number of customers do not use their products as their main transactional account.

"This video can not be played WATCH: Rory Cellan-Jones and Zoe Thomas puzzle out the Z Flip phone Samsung is making all three models in its new flagship smartphone range 5G-compatible. The top-end Galaxy S20 also introduces a 100x zoom camera. The firm also confirmed a new foldable, the Galaxy Z Flip. It uses ""folding glass"" in its display and small fibres in its hinge to protect itself from damage. Several rivals plan their own handset launches over the coming weeks. But the spread of the coronavirus poses a threat to production. ""The virus is going to affect the supply chain,"" said Ben Wood from the consultancy CCS Insight. ""Although Samsung has diversified its manufacturing into places way beyond China, there will still be components in these phones sourced from China."" Many factories in the country have delayed re-opening after its New Year break because of fears the virus could spread in the workplace. China is also the world's biggest smartphone market, and the outbreak has hit local demand. The S20 handsets come in three sizes with different camera capabilities Samsung has suffered less impact than many of its rivals to date because it makes most of its handsets in Vietnam, and sells relatively few phones to Chinese consumers. But TrendForce - a research firm - still predicts the virus will cause the South Korean firm to produce 3% fewer devices than it might have in the current quarter. ""I'm expecting that to mean some delays in delivering the new handsets,"" added Francisco Jeronimo an analyst at IDC. Samsung told the BBC it was making its ""best effort to minimise impact on our operations"". This video can not be played WATCH: Lara Lewington tests the Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra There are three S20 variants: the basic model with a 6.2in (15.7cm) display. It has three rear cameras: a 64-megapixel telephoto lens, a 12MP wide and a 12MP ultra-wide. It starts at $999/Â£799 the S20+ has a 6.7in (17cm) display. It adds a depth sensor to the basic model's array. It starts at $1,199/Â£999 the S20 Ultra has a 6.9in (17.5cm) display. Its telephoto lens is only 48MP, but the wide-angle lens is bumped up to 108MP. It starts at $1,399/Â£1,199 The S20 Ultra's camera module is thicker than that of the others to incorporate a periscope. This uses a prism to reflect light into the device's interior, allowing the wide-angle option to feature a longer lens and bigger sensor. Although it is possible to take 108MP shots, owners are expected to let the phone automatically merge groups of nine pixels into one most of the time. This aids low-light photography. The 100x ""super-resolution zoom"" facility uses the lower-resolution 48MP camera. Machine-learning techniques stitch together pixels from up to 20 different frames to achieve a better result than would be possible via a simple digital zoom. The S20 Ultra uses a prism to get light to its largest sensor It allows Samsung to boast double the zoom range of Huawei's competing P30 handset, although one expert questioned how usable it was in practice. ""The 100x zoom ends up with a quite blurred image, so I don't think people will turn to it that often"", commented Mr Jeronimo. ""But it should have a wow factor when shown off in stores. And at 20x to 30x you can get a good photo."" The phones also introduce Single Take mode. Samsung said this uses artificial intelligence to simultaneously take a mix of stills and videos via the various cameras, giving the owner a selection to choose from after the fact. Single Take mode takes photos and video clips over a 10 second period using a variety of the cameras ""We want to make sure consumers can really enjoy the moment in front of them... and don't have to worry about adjusting settings,"" explained product manager Mark Holloway. The phones are also among the first to be capable of recording in 8K resolution - four times as many pixels as 4K and 16 as many as 1080p high definition. Most people do not yet own 8K screens, but Samsung suggests this offers a degree of future-proofing as well as the ability to extract high-quality stills from the footage. ""Both the new tech and the more user-friendly user interface should help with how Samsung's camera functionality is perceived,"" commented Carolina Milanesi from Creative Strategies. ""Its results in the past were not quite on a par with competitors, perhaps signalling it wasn't leveraging software to do the heavy-lifting as much as the likes of Apple and Google. This time round there is definitely more 'AI' involved."" The S20 phones are Samsung's first to feature screens that refresh their image 120 times a second, which it says should make games appear smoother Samsung is pitching gaming as one benefit of having 5G connectivity, suggesting that lower latencies will mean that players can see and react to events in online titles split-seconds faster than if they were on 4G. Samsung highlights that 5G offers faster upload and download speeds as well as less lag time when using remote services The phones' Google Duo app also displays video chats in higher quality when on 5G. Samsung surprises with Galaxy Flip Z Oscars reveal 5G mobile networks are not ready for primetime 5G explained in 45 seconds Networks are still in the early stages of deploying the technology, but one consultant said it was still wise to offer it as standard. ""Consumers are holding on to their phones for three or four years, and don't want something that will become obsolete in that lifetime,"" said Ben Wood. ""And this launch represents a unique opportunity: Huawei is on the back foot as it doesn't have access to Google's suite of apps, and Apple currently doesn't have a 5G-capable iPhone."" The Z Flip is the second smartphone Samsung has made with a flexible screen The Z Flip, however, is limited to 4G. Several of its features - including a clamshell design with a small display on the outside and a 6.7in foldable screen on the inside -had already been revealed by Samsung in a TV advert on Sunday. It represents the firm's second attempt at a foldable after the troubled launch of the Galaxy Fold tablet-phone hybrid. This time round, the concept is a tall-screened phone that can be used one-handed when opened, and made wallet-sized when closed. The hinge mechanism has also evolved. It now incorporates tiny brushes to sweep away dirt and dust particles. In addition, it can hold the device partially open, which Samsung is pitching as being helpful for taking selfies or recording vlogs. The firm says it can be opened and closed more than 200,000 times. The Z Flip can be placed part-open on a flat surface The other big change is to the display, which now features a substance Samsung calls ""folding glass"". ""You clearly notice that the screen is much more resistant than the Fold's, which should reduce the risk of scratching,"" said Mr Francisco. ""It's still probably not as resistant as a normal smartphone, but you can feel its quality."" The Z Flip will cost $1,380 in the US and Â£1,300 in the UK and becomes available on 14 February. The original Galaxy Fold had to be re-engineered after several reviewers complained their examples had become damaged It will compete with Motorola's Razr, which has a similar design. But both are expected to sell in far smaller quantities than the S20 range. ""There's a lot of excitement around this new category, but [for most] they are prohibitively expensive,"" said Paolo Pescatore from PP Foresight. 25 January:Lunar New Year, one of the biggest festivals of the year, takes place. Millions of people travel home, and many companies close or slow down production. 27 January:Chinese authorities officially extend the holiday period until 10 February to try and contain the spread of the virus. The move affects suppliers of smartphone components for Samsung, Apple, and others. 30 January-3 February:Apple announces all its stores and offices in china will remain shut until at least 9 February,as does Microsoft and Google, while Samsung closes its flagship store in Shanghai. 7 February:Aspressure mounts from companies around the worldfor China to re-open its production facilities, Apple supplierFoxconn repurposes part of its production line to make surgical masks. 10 February:Foxconn receives permission to reopen two major plants in Zhenghzou and Shenzhen. But Reuters news agency reports that only 10% of workers turned up, citing an unnamed source. Other factories remain closed - and some local authorities tell factories not to reopen until 1 March.

"Michelle O'Neill has been the vice-president of Sinn FÃ©in since 2018 Sinn FÃ©in's deputy leader has said police have told her dissident republicans are planning an attack on herself and party colleague Gerry Kelly. Michelle O'Neill is NI's deputy first minister, and Mr Kelly is the party's policing spokesperson. She said Sinn FÃ©in had received the warning from the PSNI on Tuesday. Ms O'Neill said her party would not be deterred, followingits success in the Irish general election. On Monday, Sinn FÃ©in celebrated its best-ever electoral result, winning 37 seats out of 160 and taking the highest share of first preference votes. ""The backdrop (of the threats) is that 500,000 people have voted for Sinn FÃ©in and voted for change in recent elections,"" she said. ""These people have nothing to offer society, nothing but intent to attack myself, and Gerry and our families. Why is dissident republican activity on the rise? ""Dissident republicans have no strategy, no plan and no progress towards Irish unity. It also comes at a time with a backdrop where we have never been closer to Irish unity. ""I will not be deterred and Sinn FÃ©in will not be deterred."" DUP leader and First Minister Arlene Foster condemned those responsible, saying: ""There is no place for threats or violence. ""We live in a democracy. The ballot box is how we effect change, not through the bomb or bullet. ""Whether in 1970, 1980, 1990 or 2020, violence from every hue must be condemned."" Ms O'Neill said she could not comment further on the nature of the intelligence the PSNI had received, but said she and Mr Kelly had to take measures to protect their families. She and Mr Kellyattended a PSNI recruitment event in Belfast last week, which was described by the Chief Constable Simon Byrne as a positive step forward, regarding a drive to encourage more Catholics to join the force. Last year, there were attempted bomb attacks by dissident republicans on police in Belfast, Craigavon and Fermanagh. The two dissident republican groups involved are the New IRA and the Continuity IRA. Both groups are said to want to demonstrate they continue to exist and that they remain capable of violence, partly as a means to attract recruits - not just young individuals, but those from an older generation. They see themselves as continuing physical force republicanism against British rule.

"This video can not be played Chancellor: 'UK trade will be better outside EU' UK trade will thrive despite the introduction of UK border checks after the Brexit transition period, the chancellor has said. Sajid Javid admitted frictionless trade with the EU would be ""over"" but said that Britain would have a ""better future"". Earlier, an industry body warned border checks on importscould cause fresh food supply problems. But Mr Javid said supply chains ""would be protected"". ""Of course, we are not going to have completely frictionless trade because we have left the [EU] customs union and single market,"" he told BBC economics editor Faisal Islam. ""That is a deliberate decision, because we have a better future as an independent sovereign nation trading with European friends, but also trading more so with the rest of the world."" He said the government would defend automotive and other industries that rely on frictionless trade, promising ""complete equivalence"". ""We are working closely with the car sector,"" he said. ""We've been clear there will be some changes but that can be done in a way that the sector... continues to thrive."" Britain left the EU on 31 January but remains subject to its rules until the end of the transition period on 31 December 2020. The government has vowed to strike a trade deal by then, but some warn it will not have time to reach a comprehensive agreement. Commenting on Britain's goals, Mr Javid said he had urged the EU to consider Britain's financial sector as ""equivalent"", in order to protect its access to the bloc. This was despite the EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, having said earlier on Tuesday that this was not up for discussion. Border delays 'could cause fresh food problems' The chancellor said he was confident the bloc would change its mind: ""Look back at withdrawal agreement, there were things that EU would reject... only to change their mind later on."" He added there had been ""private discussions"" with the EU that made him ""very confident about the future"". Earlier, the British Retail Consortium warned that post-Brexit transition border checks could cause fresh food supply problems unless there was a ""massive upgrade"" in border facilities. It said thousands of trucks, including those carrying fresh food, could be held up at Channel ports. The warning came after the government said the checks would meanextra paperwork for both EU and UK firms.,external Michael Gove, the minister in charge of Brexit preparations, told an event on Monday that the end of frictionless trade was ""inevitable"".

"Prime Minister Boris Johnson has confirmed that the controversial HS2 high-speed rail link will go ahead. It follows a five-month review which he ordered last August, and an election at which the Tories failed to commit fully to the project in their manifesto. The first phase of the route will travel between London and Birmingham, with a second phase going to Manchester and Leeds. The rail link was signed off by MPs in 2017, but has since faced opposition from a variety of quarters. This has ranged between outright opposition on cost or delivery grounds, to local concerns from those MPs whose constituencies are on or near the route. HS2 go-ahead 'controversial and difficult' How much? Six reasons why HS2 is so expensive 'HS2 has completely wrecked our lives' When completed, the rail link will run through about 70 constituencies, most of them currently held by Conservative MPs. Given the government's 80-strong majority, the future of the project is all but assured, but support and criticism within Parliament is bound to continue. After the announcement was made, long-term HS2 critic Dame Cheryl Gillan said she remained convinced HS2 will not deliver ""value for money"". She said that she was also concerned construction would cause ""substantial environmental destruction"" to her Chesham and Amersham constituency, in Buckinghamshire. ""Its construction will prove highly disruptive and by a construction industry who by its own admission lacks the capacity to deliver on alongside other infrastructure projects in the pipeline,"" she added. However fellow Conservative Kieran Mullan, whose constituency will benefit directly from HS2 services calling at Crewe, was more supportive in the Commons. ""The prime minister has well and truly swept the leaves off the line of transport infrastructure investment in this country,"" he told MPs. ""I know businesses in Crewe and Nantwich will benefit locally, not jobs and businesses in London, but locally in Crewe and Nantwich"". However, another MP in the area, Sir Graham Brady, questioned why the planned station for Manchester airport was due to be be built in his Altrincham and Sale West constituency rather than at the airport itself. He also called for an urgent review into a section of the line to Manchester which will cut through a number of villages, which he said would cost more than Â£1bn and prove ""entirely unnecessary"". Nottingham South MP Lilian Greenwood, who used to chair Parliament's transport committee, said the go-ahead for HS2 was ""welcome news"". The Nottingham South MP asked for a guarantee that a later part of the route, from the West Midlands to Leeds via the East Midlands, will be rubber-stamped by Parliament within the next five years. Questioning the PM in the Commons, she expressed concern that this part of the route could be ""delayed further or downgraded to cut costs"". Long-term HS2 critic Andrew Bridgen was the sole Conservative MP during Tuesday's Commons debate to continue to voice outright opposition to the project. The high-speed link, he added, would ""adversely affect"" his constituents in North West Leicestershire. ""HS2 is unloved and unwanted, and has been grossly mismanaged,"" he said. ""Does the prime minister appreciate my and my constituents' concerns that this could well be an albatross around this government's and the country's neck."" However, another previous Conservative critic, Victoria Prentis, signalled that she would now be getting behind the project. ""The last three years have given us a few lessons in what gracious defeat looks like,"" said the MP for Banbury, Oxfordshire. ""Although I remain worried by the environmental, financial and governance issues of the project, I really do wish it all the best."" Labour's Mike Kane, who told MPs that HS2 will run underneath his own house, in Wythenshawe, Greater Manchester, also welcomed the news. Quicker journey times to the north of England, he said, would open up ""a plethora of opportunities for the poor people of the south-east and the great city of Manchester"", said the Wythenshawe and Sale East MP. He did, however, suggest to the prime minister that the project would have benefitted from a change in its starting position. ""If he wants to level up and have a northern powerhouse, why does he not start building the line from Manchester down?"" he asked. How much?

"The government has pledged Â£5bn over the next five years to improve bus and cycling services in England. Boris Johnson said the extra money will provide more frequent services and simpler, more affordable fares. Mr Johnson told MPs that investments in local infrastructure would ""improve quality of life and productivity"". But Labour said the PM's plan ""doesn't make up for deep cuts since 2010"" that have led to thousands of route closures. The announcement comes as the government gave the go-ahead to the HS2 project. Plans for first all-electric bus town revealed Cycling lessons for all children plan Bus funding: Where would it help the most? Mr Johnson set out details of the high speed rail link and the new money for cycling and buses in a statement to the Commons. In addition to improving frequency and fares, he said the Â£5bn of funding will go towards new priority routes for buses and 4,000 ""zero-carbon"" buses in England and Wales. This video can not be played The Cornwall teenager with a two hour bus commute Other planned improvements include: More evening and weekend services to make it easier for people to get around outside peak hours A ""simpler, cheaper and more convenient"" ticketing system for buses Priority schemes to allow buses to pass quickly through congested roads In September, ministers announced Â£220m in extra funding to boost the bus network in England. They hope the cash will enable operators to restore recently withdrawn services, to give passengers in rural areas more choice and to increase the use of contactless payments. Further details will be announced in a new National Bus Strategy to be published later this year. Mr Johnson told MPs that the government's investment plan ""must be local"" to connect left-behind places to the rest of the country. ""We can unite and level up across the country with fantastic local improvements. better rail, less congested roads, beautiful British-built buses, cleaner, greener, quicker, safer, more frequent,"" he said. ""Above all, we can improve the quality of life for people and improve their productivity, make places more attractive to live in and invest in."" Responding to the prime minister, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn described Mr Johnson's plan as ""piecemeal"" and said the planned investment ""doesn't make up for deep cuts since 2010"" in bus services. ""Funding for buses has fallen by Â£645m a year since 2010, 3,300 routes cut or withdrawn and fares have soared,"" he said. ""It's councils that keep bus routes open. We need long-term funding for the local authorities that have suffered such severe cuts and now face a further Â£8bn black hole over this Parliament."" British Chambers of Commerce director general, Adam Marshall, welcomed the funding and said: ""Business communities will want to work with central government, local government and bus operators to ensure that this new funding makes a real difference on the ground."" On cycling, Mr Johnson promised to create ""hundreds of miles"" of new cycle paths and plans to make cycling safer in towns by expanding projects dubbed ""mini Holland"" schemes. The aim of creating ""low-traffic neighbourhoods"" outside of London is part of government plans to double rates of cycling by the 2025. There are plans for more evening and weekend services Campaign group the Walking and Cycling Alliance said ""the emphasis on quality infrastructure is to be applauded"" and that it hoped to work with other groups to ""ensure that this investment is the start of a real transformation in how we get around"". A spokesperson added: ""It has never been more important to make it easier to walk and cycle - to tackle climate change, poor air quality, crippling congestion, and the mental and physical health of the nation. ""The evidence is clear and people want to do it, what has been lacking is the investment and ambition to make it safe and easy for everyone.""

"The Northamptonshire Badger Group rescued and released the badger Staff working in a shop had a shock when they found a badger had fallen through the ceiling and landed behind a counter. The badger came through a ceiling panel in the Superdrug store in Northampton's Grosvenor Centre and then ran under the perfume counter. The Northamptonshire Badger Group was called to rescue the female animal and subsequently set it free. Sally Jones, from the group, said it was ""the oddest rescue we've ever had"". She said she did not know how the young female badger got into the shop on Sunday, which was closed to the public at the time. ""There were four of our members there to catch the badger and we are really perplexed as to how it got into the Grosvenor Centre."" Ms Jones said it was suggested it could have entered via ducts in the back of the shop and staff saw it ""fall through the ceiling"". Staff said the badger hit the floor and it ""trundled off a bit dazed"". Frog from Ecuador found in Tesco bananas Oxygen masks revive cats pulled from fire Police give 'dangerous' Malamute a second chance Ms Jones said by the time the group arrived to rescue the badger ""there were perfume bottles strewn over the floor"".

"This video can not be played WATCH: Rory Cellan-Jones and Zoe Thomas puzzle out the Z Flip phone Samsung is making all three models in its new flagship smartphone range 5G-compatible. The top-end Galaxy S20 also introduces a 100x zoom camera. The firm also confirmed a new foldable, the Galaxy Z Flip. It uses ""folding glass"" in its display and small fibres in its hinge to protect itself from damage. Several rivals plan their own handset launches over the coming weeks. But the spread of the coronavirus poses a threat to production. ""The virus is going to affect the supply chain,"" said Ben Wood from the consultancy CCS Insight. ""Although Samsung has diversified its manufacturing into places way beyond China, there will still be components in these phones sourced from China."" Many factories in the country have delayed re-opening after its New Year break because of fears the virus could spread in the workplace. China is also the world's biggest smartphone market, and the outbreak has hit local demand. The S20 handsets come in three sizes with different camera capabilities Samsung has suffered less impact than many of its rivals to date because it makes most of its handsets in Vietnam, and sells relatively few phones to Chinese consumers. But TrendForce - a research firm - still predicts the virus will cause the South Korean firm to produce 3% fewer devices than it might have in the current quarter. ""I'm expecting that to mean some delays in delivering the new handsets,"" added Francisco Jeronimo an analyst at IDC. Samsung told the BBC it was making its ""best effort to minimise impact on our operations"". This video can not be played WATCH: Lara Lewington tests the Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra There are three S20 variants: the basic model with a 6.2in (15.7cm) display. It has three rear cameras: a 64-megapixel telephoto lens, a 12MP wide and a 12MP ultra-wide. It starts at $999/Â£799 the S20+ has a 6.7in (17cm) display. It adds a depth sensor to the basic model's array. It starts at $1,199/Â£999 the S20 Ultra has a 6.9in (17.5cm) display. Its telephoto lens is only 48MP, but the wide-angle lens is bumped up to 108MP. It starts at $1,399/Â£1,199 The S20 Ultra's camera module is thicker than that of the others to incorporate a periscope. This uses a prism to reflect light into the device's interior, allowing the wide-angle option to feature a longer lens and bigger sensor. Although it is possible to take 108MP shots, owners are expected to let the phone automatically merge groups of nine pixels into one most of the time. This aids low-light photography. The 100x ""super-resolution zoom"" facility uses the lower-resolution 48MP camera. Machine-learning techniques stitch together pixels from up to 20 different frames to achieve a better result than would be possible via a simple digital zoom. The S20 Ultra uses a prism to get light to its largest sensor It allows Samsung to boast double the zoom range of Huawei's competing P30 handset, although one expert questioned how usable it was in practice. ""The 100x zoom ends up with a quite blurred image, so I don't think people will turn to it that often"", commented Mr Jeronimo. ""But it should have a wow factor when shown off in stores. And at 20x to 30x you can get a good photo."" The phones also introduce Single Take mode. Samsung said this uses artificial intelligence to simultaneously take a mix of stills and videos via the various cameras, giving the owner a selection to choose from after the fact. Single Take mode takes photos and video clips over a 10 second period using a variety of the cameras ""We want to make sure consumers can really enjoy the moment in front of them... and don't have to worry about adjusting settings,"" explained product manager Mark Holloway. The phones are also among the first to be capable of recording in 8K resolution - four times as many pixels as 4K and 16 as many as 1080p high definition. Most people do not yet own 8K screens, but Samsung suggests this offers a degree of future-proofing as well as the ability to extract high-quality stills from the footage. ""Both the new tech and the more user-friendly user interface should help with how Samsung's camera functionality is perceived,"" commented Carolina Milanesi from Creative Strategies. ""Its results in the past were not quite on a par with competitors, perhaps signalling it wasn't leveraging software to do the heavy-lifting as much as the likes of Apple and Google. This time round there is definitely more 'AI' involved."" The S20 phones are Samsung's first to feature screens that refresh their image 120 times a second, which it says should make games appear smoother Samsung is pitching gaming as one benefit of having 5G connectivity, suggesting that lower latencies will mean that players can see and react to events in online titles split-seconds faster than if they were on 4G. Samsung highlights that 5G offers faster upload and download speeds as well as less lag time when using remote services The phones' Google Duo app also displays video chats in higher quality when on 5G. Samsung surprises with Galaxy Flip Z Oscars reveal 5G mobile networks are not ready for primetime 5G explained in 45 seconds Networks are still in the early stages of deploying the technology, but one consultant said it was still wise to offer it as standard. ""Consumers are holding on to their phones for three or four years, and don't want something that will become obsolete in that lifetime,"" said Ben Wood. ""And this launch represents a unique opportunity: Huawei is on the back foot as it doesn't have access to Google's suite of apps, and Apple currently doesn't have a 5G-capable iPhone."" The Z Flip is the second smartphone Samsung has made with a flexible screen The Z Flip, however, is limited to 4G. Several of its features - including a clamshell design with a small display on the outside and a 6.7in foldable screen on the inside -had already been revealed by Samsung in a TV advert on Sunday. It represents the firm's second attempt at a foldable after the troubled launch of the Galaxy Fold tablet-phone hybrid. This time round, the concept is a tall-screened phone that can be used one-handed when opened, and made wallet-sized when closed. The hinge mechanism has also evolved. It now incorporates tiny brushes to sweep away dirt and dust particles. In addition, it can hold the device partially open, which Samsung is pitching as being helpful for taking selfies or recording vlogs. The firm says it can be opened and closed more than 200,000 times. The Z Flip can be placed part-open on a flat surface The other big change is to the display, which now features a substance Samsung calls ""folding glass"". ""You clearly notice that the screen is much more resistant than the Fold's, which should reduce the risk of scratching,"" said Mr Francisco. ""It's still probably not as resistant as a normal smartphone, but you can feel its quality."" The Z Flip will cost $1,380 in the US and Â£1,300 in the UK and becomes available on 14 February. The original Galaxy Fold had to be re-engineered after several reviewers complained their examples had become damaged It will compete with Motorola's Razr, which has a similar design. But both are expected to sell in far smaller quantities than the S20 range. ""There's a lot of excitement around this new category, but [for most] they are prohibitively expensive,"" said Paolo Pescatore from PP Foresight. 25 January:Lunar New Year, one of the biggest festivals of the year, takes place. Millions of people travel home, and many companies close or slow down production. 27 January:Chinese authorities officially extend the holiday period until 10 February to try and contain the spread of the virus. The move affects suppliers of smartphone components for Samsung, Apple, and others. 30 January-3 February:Apple announces all its stores and offices in china will remain shut until at least 9 February,as does Microsoft and Google, while Samsung closes its flagship store in Shanghai. 7 February:Aspressure mounts from companies around the worldfor China to re-open its production facilities, Apple supplierFoxconn repurposes part of its production line to make surgical masks. 10 February:Foxconn receives permission to reopen two major plants in Zhenghzou and Shenzhen. But Reuters news agency reports that only 10% of workers turned up, citing an unnamed source. Other factories remain closed - and some local authorities tell factories not to reopen until 1 March.

"A British man linked to 11 coronavirus cases has spoken for the first time, saying he has ""fully recovered"" from the illness. Steve Walsh, who remains quarantined in hospital, says his thoughts are with others who have contracted the virus. He said his family have been asked to isolate themselves ""as a precaution"". Meanwhile, Health Secretary Matt Hancock warned that the spread of the coronavirus would worsen before it improved. ""Dealing with this disease is a marathon, not a sprint,"" he told MPs in the Commons. ""We will do everything that is effective to tackle this virus and keep people safe."" Coronavirus officially named Covid-19, says WHO Can coronavirus be transmitted by door handles? And other questions Bosses 'removed' as virus death toll hits 1,000 Mr Walsh, from Hove, who works for a firm providing gas analysis equipment, caught the virus in Singapore and is thought to have infected 11 others at a French ski resort. Five of the cases linked to Mr Walsh are in England, five are in France and one is in Majorca, Spain. Two of the people who contracted coronavirus at the chalet where Steve Walsh stayed are Bob Saynor and his wife, Catriona Greenwood. She worked as a locum GP at the County Oak medical centre in Brighton, which was temporarily closed on Monday. Eight people have tested positive for the virus in the UK so far. One of those infected is an A&E worker at Worthing Hospital in West Sussex, the Department of Health said on Tuesday. All services at the hospital continue to operate as normal, a spokeswoman for the department said. Public Health England is contacting the very small number of patients who were seen by the A&E worker, who had followed advice to self-isolate. There have now beenmore than 40,000 cases of coronavirus worldwide, which has been declared a global health emergency. The death toll in China stands at 1,016. On Monday, the government issuednew powers in England,externalto keep people in quarantine to stop the virus spreading. Under the Department of Health measures people will not be free to leave quarantine, and can be forcibly sent into isolation if they pose a threat. Mr Hancock said these powers were ""proportionate"" and will ""help us slow down transmission of the virus"". The health secretary also announced that ""a capital facility"" was being launched immediately ""to support any urgent works the NHS needs for the coronavirus response, such as the creation of further isolation areas and other necessary facilities"". Speaking on a visit to Birmingham, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the public had ""every reason to be confident and calm"" about the threat of the virus, adding: ""We have got a fantastic NHS"". Coronavirus labs to begin testing in Scotland How worried should we be? Your questions answered Coronavirus: 'I walk around my block to stay sane' Meanwhile, the government has asked medical suppliers to carry out a risk assessment on the impact of coronavirus and travel restrictions introduced by the Chinese government. Companies have also been asked to retain existing stockpiles of medical supplies, which had been compiled as a contingency measure ahead of Breixt, the Department of Health said. The department said there were no current medicine shortages in the UK linked to the outbreak and the measures were precautionary. Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, described the economic impact of the virus in the UK as ""containable"". In other developments: As of Tuesday afternoon, a total of 1,358 people have been tested for coronavirus, of which eight were confirmed positive Among those quarantined on the Wirral is nine-year-old Jasmine Siddle from Northumberland, who had to spend her birthday in hospital Patcham Nursing Home in Brighton confirmed on Tuesday that it has ""closed to all visitors"" as a precaution after one of the infected GPs visited a patient there Another branch of the County Oak medical centre in Brighton - located less than two miles away in Deneway - was also closed on Tuesday, along with the Haven Practice in Brighton All three surgeries are expected to reopen on Wednesday after deep cleaning The World Health Organization said it nowhas a name for the new coronavirus- Covid-19 County Oak medical centre in Brighton was closed for cleaning on Monday Mr Walsh contracted the coronavirus at a work conference in Singapore, before travelling to a French ski resort for a holiday on his way back to the UK. In a statement from quarantine in Guy's Hospital in London, Mr Walsh, a cub scout leader, thanked the NHS for their care. He said he contacted his GP, NHS 111 and Public Health England, on learning he had been exposed to a confirmed case of coronavirus. He added: ""I was advised to attend an isolated room at hospital, despite showing no symptoms, and subsequently self-isolated at home as instructed. ""When the diagnosis was confirmed I was sent to an isolation unit in hospital, where I remain, and, as a precaution, my family was also asked to isolate themselves."" He thanked friends, family and colleagues for their support, adding: ""I ask the media to respect our privacy."" The main signs of infection are fever (high temperature) and a cough as well as shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. Frequent hand washing with soap or gel, avoiding close contact with people who are ill and not touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands, can help cut the risk of infection. Catching coughs and sneezes in a tissue, binning it and washing your hands can minimise the risk of spreading disease. Anyone experiencing symptoms, even if mild, after travelling from mainland China, Thailand, Japan, Republic of Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia or Macau, is advised to stay indoors and call the NHS 111 phone service. In a statement, Servomex, Mr Walsh's employer, said it continues to ""provide support"" to him and his family. It added that it had enforced travel restrictions and self-isolation for employees who attended the Singapore conference or who have shown symptoms of the virus. Last month,two other people - who are related - were confirmed as having coronavirus after being taken ill at a hotel in York. It was later revealed that one is a student at the University of York.

"The UK economy saw no growth in the final three months of 2019, as manufacturing contracted for the third quarter in a row and the service sector slowed around the time of the election. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the car industry had seen a particularly weak quarter. The ONS figures also showed,externalthe economy grew by 1.4% in 2019, marginally higher than the 1.3% rate in 2018. Recent surveys have suggested that the economy has picked up in the new year. Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics, suggested that the flat growth seen at the end of the year would ""prove to be a low point"". She added: ""The pick-up in the surveys of activity and sentiment suggest the first quarter will be much better. ""The GDP figures were not quite as bad as we had feared in quarter four. The stagnation in GDP beat our forecast of a 0.1% quarter-on-quarter fall."" In December alone the economy grew by 0.3%, the ONS said, reversing the decline seen previously in November. Chancellorâs economic growth goal âunrealisticâ UK rates held as economy shows signs of picking up ""It's likely that political uncertainty and unwinding stockpiles caused the economy to flag at the end of last year,"" said Tej Parikh, chief economist at the Institute of Directors. ""However, firms entered 2020 with more of a spring in their step. Confidence has shot up, while hiring plans and investment intentions have also risen a notch, but the post-election bounce may tail off."" Rob Kent-Smith, the ONS's head of GDP, said: ""There was no growth in the last quarter of 2019 as increases in the services and construction sectors were offset by another poor showing from manufacturing, particularly the motor industry."" The services sector - which accounts for more than three-quarter of the UK economy - grew by just 0.1% in the final quarter of 2019, while the construction sector grew by 0.5%. However, the manufacturing sector saw output fall by 1.1%. That came after some car factories paused work in November in case Britain left the European Union without a deal on 31 October. The ONS revised up the growth figure for the third quarter of 2019 to 0.5% from its previous estimate of 0.4%. The last three months of 2019 also saw the trade deficit in goods and services widen to Â£6.5bn from the Â£4bn deficit seen between July and September. A deficit occurs when the value of a country's imports in goods and services exceeds what it exports. The deficit widened largely because of a shrinking of the surplus in UK trade in services. By contrast, the goods trade deficit shrank in the last three months of 2019. That was mostly accounted for by a Â£2.2bn decrease in machinery and transport equipment imports, which could suggest that orders might have been brought forward to avoid the (postponed) October Brexit deadline. For 2019 as a whole, the trade deficit for goods and services narrowed slightly by Â£0.5bn to Â£29.3bn.

And other questions Bosses 'removed' as virus death toll hits 1,000 Mr Walsh, from Hove, who works for a firm providing gas analysis equipment, caught the virus in Singapore and is thought to have infected 11 others at a French ski resort. Five of the cases linked to Mr Walsh are in England, five are in France and one is in Majorca, Spain. Two of the people who contracted coronavirus at the chalet where Steve Walsh stayed are Bob Saynor and his wife, Catriona Greenwood. She worked as a locum GP at the County Oak medical centre in Brighton, which was temporarily closed on Monday. Eight people have tested positive for the virus in the UK so far. One of those infected is an A&E worker at Worthing Hospital in West Sussex, the Department of Health said on Tuesday. All services at the hospital continue to operate as normal, a spokeswoman for the department said. Public Health England is contacting the very small number of patients who were seen by the A&E worker, who had followed advice to self-isolate. There have now beenmore than 40,000 cases of coronavirus worldwide, which has been declared a global health emergency. The death toll in China stands at 1,016. On Monday, the government issuednew powers in England,externalto keep people in quarantine to stop the virus spreading. Under the Department of Health measures people will not be free to leave quarantine, and can be forcibly sent into isolation if they pose a threat. Mr Hancock said these powers were ""proportionate"" and will ""help us slow down transmission of the virus"". The health secretary also announced that ""a capital facility"" was being launched immediately ""to support any urgent works the NHS needs for the coronavirus response, such as the creation of further isolation areas and other necessary facilities"". Speaking on a visit to Birmingham, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the public had ""every reason to be confident and calm"" about the threat of the virus, adding: ""We have got a fantastic NHS"". Coronavirus labs to begin testing in Scotland How worried should we be? Your questions answered Coronavirus: 'I walk around my block to stay sane' Meanwhile, the government has asked medical suppliers to carry out a risk assessment on the impact of coronavirus and travel restrictions introduced by the Chinese government. Companies have also been asked to retain existing stockpiles of medical supplies, which had been compiled as a contingency measure ahead of Breixt, the Department of Health said. The department said there were no current medicine shortages in the UK linked to the outbreak and the measures were precautionary. Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, described the economic impact of the virus in the UK as ""containable"". In other developments: As of Tuesday afternoon, a total of 1,358 people have been tested for coronavirus, of which eight were confirmed positive Among those quarantined on the Wirral is nine-year-old Jasmine Siddle from Northumberland, who had to spend her birthday in hospital Patcham Nursing Home in Brighton confirmed on Tuesday that it has ""closed to all visitors"" as a precaution after one of the infected GPs visited a patient there Another branch of the County Oak medical centre in Brighton - located less than two miles away in Deneway - was also closed on Tuesday, along with the Haven Practice in Brighton All three surgeries are expected to reopen on Wednesday after deep cleaning The World Health Organization said it nowhas a name for the new coronavirus- Covid-19 County Oak medical centre in Brighton was closed for cleaning on Monday Mr Walsh contracted the coronavirus at a work conference in Singapore, before travelling to a French ski resort for a holiday on his way back to the UK. In a statement from quarantine in Guy's Hospital in London, Mr Walsh, a cub scout leader, thanked the NHS for their care. He said he contacted his GP, NHS 111 and Public Health England, on learning he had been exposed to a confirmed case of coronavirus. He added: ""I was advised to attend an isolated room at hospital, despite showing no symptoms, and subsequently self-isolated at home as instructed. ""When the diagnosis was confirmed I was sent to an isolation unit in hospital, where I remain, and, as a precaution, my family was also asked to isolate themselves."" He thanked friends, family and colleagues for their support, adding: ""I ask the media to respect our privacy."" The main signs of infection are fever (high temperature) and a cough as well as shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. Frequent hand washing with soap or gel, avoiding close contact with people who are ill and not touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands, can help cut the risk of infection. Catching coughs and sneezes in a tissue, binning it and washing your hands can minimise the risk of spreading disease. Anyone experiencing symptoms, even if mild, after travelling from mainland China, Thailand, Japan, Republic of Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia or Macau, is advised to stay indoors and call the NHS 111 phone service. In a statement, Servomex, Mr Walsh's employer, said it continues to ""provide support"" to him and his family. It added that it had enforced travel restrictions and self-isolation for employees who attended the Singapore conference or who have shown symptoms of the virus. Last month,two other people - who are related - were confirmed as having coronavirus after being taken ill at a hotel in York. It was later revealed that one is a student at the University of York.

"The UK economy saw no growth in the final three months of 2019, as manufacturing contracted for the third quarter in a row and the service sector slowed around the time of the election. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the car industry had seen a particularly weak quarter. The ONS figures also showed,externalthe economy grew by 1.4% in 2019, marginally higher than the 1.3% rate in 2018. Recent surveys have suggested that the economy has picked up in the new year. Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics, suggested that the flat growth seen at the end of the year would ""prove to be a low point"". She added: ""The pick-up in the surveys of activity and sentiment suggest the first quarter will be much better. ""The GDP figures were not quite as bad as we had feared in quarter four. The stagnation in GDP beat our forecast of a 0.1% quarter-on-quarter fall."" In December alone the economy grew by 0.3%, the ONS said, reversing the decline seen previously in November. Chancellorâs economic growth goal âunrealisticâ UK rates held as economy shows signs of picking up ""It's likely that political uncertainty and unwinding stockpiles caused the economy to flag at the end of last year,"" said Tej Parikh, chief economist at the Institute of Directors. ""However, firms entered 2020 with more of a spring in their step. Confidence has shot up, while hiring plans and investment intentions have also risen a notch, but the post-election bounce may tail off."" Rob Kent-Smith, the ONS's head of GDP, said: ""There was no growth in the last quarter of 2019 as increases in the services and construction sectors were offset by another poor showing from manufacturing, particularly the motor industry."" The services sector - which accounts for more than three-quarter of the UK economy - grew by just 0.1% in the final quarter of 2019, while the construction sector grew by 0.5%. However, the manufacturing sector saw output fall by 1.1%. That came after some car factories paused work in November in case Britain left the European Union without a deal on 31 October. The ONS revised up the growth figure for the third quarter of 2019 to 0.5% from its previous estimate of 0.4%. The last three months of 2019 also saw the trade deficit in goods and services widen to Â£6.5bn from the Â£4bn deficit seen between July and September. A deficit occurs when the value of a country's imports in goods and services exceeds what it exports. The deficit widened largely because of a shrinking of the surplus in UK trade in services. By contrast, the goods trade deficit shrank in the last three months of 2019. That was mostly accounted for by a Â£2.2bn decrease in machinery and transport equipment imports, which could suggest that orders might have been brought forward to avoid the (postponed) October Brexit deadline. For 2019 as a whole, the trade deficit for goods and services narrowed slightly by Â£0.5bn to Â£29.3bn.

"The government approves the controversial HS2 rail project The PM criticised the HS2 company's management but said that did not detract from the value of the scheme Boris Johnson will appoint a full-time minister to oversee the project The route, to be completed by 2040, will link London to Birmingham, and then Manchester and Leeds Supporters say it will improve travel, create jobs and rebalance the UK's economy Critics point to the project already being over budget, behind schedule and damaging to the environment Simon Read, Marie Jackson and Lauren Turner The Â£106bn project will have an ""overall negative impact on Wales' economy,"" a transport expert says. That's it from Business Live for today. But we'll be back bright and early from 06:00 tomorrow morning with our usual mix of the latest breaking news and analysis from the business world. Do join us then. A proposed design for an HS2 train Here's a quick recap of today's developments.  Conservative former Cabinet minister Lord Young of Cookham was transport secretary in 1996 when HS1 - the fast link between London and the Channel Tunnel - was given the go-ahead. Speaking in the House of Lords today, he recalled: ""That was opposed by local MPs, it was challenged through the courts, people said it was too expensive, it was challenged on environmental grounds, people said we should spend the money on local lines instead. ""Today, I don't think there's a single member of this House who would argue that HS1 was not the right decision to take. ""Will it not be the same in 25 years' time about HS2?"" Transport Minister Baroness Vere of Norbiton added: ""HS1 was a great boon and I believe HS2 will be too."" Ros Jones, Mayor of Doncaster, says she is ""both pleased and concerned"" by today's news. The government has said there will be a review of cost-cutting measures relating to Phase 2B of the plan, which runs from Birmingham, through South Yorkshire and on to Leeds. The mayor says she would like more clarity on this review for affected residents. ""We have always supported the principle of HS2 but it is clear the current Phase 2B route is the wrong solution for South Yorkshire,"" said the mayor. ""It will have a devastating impact on our communities, tear up our landscape, limit our economic potential and cap the future growth of our rail services in our region."" She adds that having a further review into phase two means further uncertainty for affected residents, who do not know if and when their properties will be demolished. While Doncaster Council supports HS2, it is against the current planned route and has called for a South Yorkshire station to be built at Meadowhall.  Friends of the Earth tweets...

Quinn, Balfour Beatty Group boss, is excited about HS2. âHS2 is a
bold regeneration scheme that is ready for implementation and provides a true
legacy for the generations to come,"" he said. ""We must invest in their future: drive new
skills and capabilities, turbo charge small businesses across the country and
show that the UK is determined to meet its carbon reduction targets.â Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham says while he ""warmly"" welcomes the announcement, ""there was a lot of detail lacking"". He says he wanted more information on the timetable for work in the north, for example, and the line of the route. Mr Burnham adds:  We still hear the government prefers an upgrade for Northern Powerhouse rail rather than a new line. We believe this line has got to go from Liverpool through Manchester to Bradford, which would be the new line we need. So he was, I'm afraid, unspecific on all of those things. But as an overall headline, we welcome what he said.  Political leaders in West and South Yorkshire have welcomedthe prime minister's announcement that the HS2 high-speed rail link will go ahead. Dan Jarvis, Mayor of Sheffield City Region, said HS2 was ""crucial to level up the economy and provide vital upgrades to our creaking Victorian infrastructure"". However, he added: ""We need urgent investment in South Yorkshireâs wider transport infrastructure so we see improvements in the short term."" Meanwhile, Bradford Council leader Susan Hinchcliffe said while she welcomed today's announcement, the ""really key decision"" for the district's future was the government's stance on Northern Powerhouse Rail - the proposed east-west rail connection. ""We have made a strong economic case for Bradford to be a stop on a new line between Manchester and Leeds. Stopping at Bradford would add Â£15bn to the economy of the North,"" she said. Birmingham's Grade I-listed Curzon Street Station will be incorporated into plans there for a new HS2 stop. The regenerated facility, planned for a swathe of land in central Birmingham, will be the first brand new intercity terminus station built in Britain since the 19th Century, says the company behind the HS2 project. The existing historic building will be linked to the new station's eastern concourse at New Canal Street. Here's a bit of history: Leeds City Centre (artist's impression) ""HS2 is more than a railway, it has already unlocked training and
job opportunities for thousands of our citizens and is a catalyst for millions
of pounds of investment into our cities,"" says Judith Blake, chair of Core
Cities UK and leader of Leeds City Council. ""It is already attracting blue chip
companies into Birmingham and will make a major contribution to the
largest regeneration project in Europe which will see the doubling in size
of Leeds City Centre,"" she points out. ""HS2 is itself the largest engineering project in Western Europe
and should be seen as a statement of this country's bold post-Brexit ambition. ""Future delay and uncertainty
is not an option."" Alex MossBBC Yorkshire The BBC has been out and about at Leeds Railway Station talking to commuters there about HS2. There was a general air of indifference to the project - but a desire to see local rail services improved. Keith Smith, 81, said: âItâs costing an awful lot of money. Obviously improving journey times is a good thing but I'm not sure the benefits are worth the amount that is being spent. ""I would have thought they'd be better investing in the local infrastructure."" Meanwhile, Darren Wilson 49, from Hull, said: âBy the time itâs built here I probably wonât be alive.â He added: âThey need to make improvements to trains locally, rather than the ones going to London.â BBC Yorkshire's political editor tweets...

Greenpeace UK executive director John Sauven says introducing HS2 would mean the PM had ""the dubious honour of being this century's largest destroyer of ancient woodlands in the UK"". He adds: We're totally in favour of a transport revolution that cuts pollution and carbon emissions, but bulldozing through irreplaceable wildlife and nature sites is not the way to go about it.  Over 100 ancient woodlands will be damaged or destroyed along with 33 sites of special scientific interests and hundreds of local wildlife sites. Giving the go-ahead to such a costly and damaging project is a missed opportunity. The prime minister should have created a first-class regional rail and bus service, up and running across the north in years rather than decades and without adding to the climate and nature emergency.  Steve Rotheram, Metro Mayor for the Liverpool City Region, says the decision announced today is welcome ""but falls short of the full and unequivocal commitment to both HS2 and Northern Powerhouse Rail that the north needs"". He adds: I will continue to push â alongside my fellow Northern leaders â for delivery of the new west-east rail line, fully integrated with HS2, that our city region needs.  Improving rail connectivity is vitally important but, for the vast majority of people, transport is not about big national schemes, they want a local transport system they can rely on every day. Thatâs why later this month I will be announcing my plans to improve our local bus services, as part of my wider ambition to build a London-style transport system for our area.

Alan Lewis says: ""This is a great - and much needed - development for public
transport in our country. It will add considerably capacity to the completely
full rail lines between Birmingham and London. It will take fast inter-city
trains off our old Victorian rail lines and allow room for extra commuter, regional
and freight trains. This should be welcomed by all travellers, businesses and
environmentalists as it will provide additional low carbon transport, which is
much better than building more roads."" Meanwhile John Griffiths says: ""I live in rural Buckinghamshire, about four miles from the
proposed route. It wonât benefit me directly at all but to oppose it is
short-sighted."" Why? ""We will all benefit from the building of this railway,
which will bring much-needed investment and jobs to the economy at a time when
Brexit risks taking it all out,"" he says. ""To delay or cancel is only to put off a bigger cost in
the future. It was always going to have to be built one day, but to do it now
is the right thing to do."" Labour MP Stephen Kinnock has accused the government of showing ""contempt"" to the people of Wales. He says the entire budget for electrifying the railway line to Swansea would be 1% of the HS2 budget. ""Will he commit to electrification or will he continue to hold the people of Wales in contempt?"" he asks. ""North Wales will benefit from the line to Crewe,"" Boris Johnson told him in response. He added that the government has ""already electrified the line to Cardiff"". The RSPB tweets... Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"The Queen's grandson Peter Phillips and his wife Autumn have announced they are to divorce. A statement issued on their behalf said the decision was ""the best course of action for their two children and ongoing friendship"". It confirmed they had separated and will share custody of their children Savannah, nine, and Isla, seven. Both of their families were ""sad"" but ""fully supportive"" of the decision to ""co-parent"", the statement added. The couple told the Queen and other Royal Family members about their decision last year. Mr Phillips, 42, is the son of Princess Anne and her first husband, Captain Mark Phillips. Royal Family tree and line of succession Does a milk advert show Harry and Meghan's future? He is the eldest grandchild of the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh. ""The decision to divorce and share custody came about after many months of discussions and although sad, is an amicable one,"" the statement read. It added: ""Peter and Autumn have requested privacy and compassion for their children while the family continues to adapt to these changes."" Mr Phillips met Canadian management consultant Autumn Kelly, 41, at the Canadian Grand Prix in Montreal in 2003, while he wasworking for the Williams Formula 1 team. The couple married in St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle in 2008 They married in 2008 in St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle - where the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's wedding would take place ten years later - and brought up their children in Gloucestershire. Before the wedding, Mrs Phillips gave up her Catholic faith - a move which, because ofrules on royal successions that were later changed, allowed Mr Phillips to retain his right to the throne. While Mr Phillipsis a member of the Royal Family, he is not a working royal and does not have a title. Last month the Daily Mail revealed thathe featured in a Chinese television advertendorsing milk from Jersey cows. Also on Tuesday, the Queen was photographed at King's Lynn station in Norfolk, where she was returning to London following her winter break at Sandringham.

"The government approves the controversial HS2 rail project The PM criticised the HS2 company's management but said that did not detract from the value of the scheme Boris Johnson will appoint a full-time minister to oversee the project The route, to be completed by 2040, will link London to Birmingham, and then Manchester and Leeds Supporters say it will improve travel, create jobs and rebalance the UK's economy Critics point to the project already being over budget, behind schedule and damaging to the environment Simon Read, Marie Jackson and Lauren Turner The Â£106bn project will have an ""overall negative impact on Wales' economy,"" a transport expert says. That's it from Business Live for today. But we'll be back bright and early from 06:00 tomorrow morning with our usual mix of the latest breaking news and analysis from the business world. Do join us then. A proposed design for an HS2 train Here's a quick recap of today's developments.  Conservative former Cabinet minister Lord Young of Cookham was transport secretary in 1996 when HS1 - the fast link between London and the Channel Tunnel - was given the go-ahead. Speaking in the House of Lords today, he recalled: ""That was opposed by local MPs, it was challenged through the courts, people said it was too expensive, it was challenged on environmental grounds, people said we should spend the money on local lines instead. ""Today, I don't think there's a single member of this House who would argue that HS1 was not the right decision to take. ""Will it not be the same in 25 years' time about HS2?"" Transport Minister Baroness Vere of Norbiton added: ""HS1 was a great boon and I believe HS2 will be too."" Ros Jones, Mayor of Doncaster, says she is ""both pleased and concerned"" by today's news. The government has said there will be a review of cost-cutting measures relating to Phase 2B of the plan, which runs from Birmingham, through South Yorkshire and on to Leeds. The mayor says she would like more clarity on this review for affected residents. ""We have always supported the principle of HS2 but it is clear the current Phase 2B route is the wrong solution for South Yorkshire,"" said the mayor. ""It will have a devastating impact on our communities, tear up our landscape, limit our economic potential and cap the future growth of our rail services in our region."" She adds that having a further review into phase two means further uncertainty for affected residents, who do not know if and when their properties will be demolished. While Doncaster Council supports HS2, it is against the current planned route and has called for a South Yorkshire station to be built at Meadowhall.  Friends of the Earth tweets...

Quinn, Balfour Beatty Group boss, is excited about HS2. âHS2 is a
bold regeneration scheme that is ready for implementation and provides a true
legacy for the generations to come,"" he said. ""We must invest in their future: drive new
skills and capabilities, turbo charge small businesses across the country and
show that the UK is determined to meet its carbon reduction targets.â Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham says while he ""warmly"" welcomes the announcement, ""there was a lot of detail lacking"". He says he wanted more information on the timetable for work in the north, for example, and the line of the route. Mr Burnham adds:  We still hear the government prefers an upgrade for Northern Powerhouse rail rather than a new line. We believe this line has got to go from Liverpool through Manchester to Bradford, which would be the new line we need. So he was, I'm afraid, unspecific on all of those things. But as an overall headline, we welcome what he said.  Political leaders in West and South Yorkshire have welcomedthe prime minister's announcement that the HS2 high-speed rail link will go ahead. Dan Jarvis, Mayor of Sheffield City Region, said HS2 was ""crucial to level up the economy and provide vital upgrades to our creaking Victorian infrastructure"". However, he added: ""We need urgent investment in South Yorkshireâs wider transport infrastructure so we see improvements in the short term."" Meanwhile, Bradford Council leader Susan Hinchcliffe said while she welcomed today's announcement, the ""really key decision"" for the district's future was the government's stance on Northern Powerhouse Rail - the proposed east-west rail connection. ""We have made a strong economic case for Bradford to be a stop on a new line between Manchester and Leeds. Stopping at Bradford would add Â£15bn to the economy of the North,"" she said. Birmingham's Grade I-listed Curzon Street Station will be incorporated into plans there for a new HS2 stop. The regenerated facility, planned for a swathe of land in central Birmingham, will be the first brand new intercity terminus station built in Britain since the 19th Century, says the company behind the HS2 project. The existing historic building will be linked to the new station's eastern concourse at New Canal Street. Here's a bit of history: Leeds City Centre (artist's impression) ""HS2 is more than a railway, it has already unlocked training and
job opportunities for thousands of our citizens and is a catalyst for millions
of pounds of investment into our cities,"" says Judith Blake, chair of Core
Cities UK and leader of Leeds City Council. ""It is already attracting blue chip
companies into Birmingham and will make a major contribution to the
largest regeneration project in Europe which will see the doubling in size
of Leeds City Centre,"" she points out. ""HS2 is itself the largest engineering project in Western Europe
and should be seen as a statement of this country's bold post-Brexit ambition. ""Future delay and uncertainty
is not an option."" Alex MossBBC Yorkshire The BBC has been out and about at Leeds Railway Station talking to commuters there about HS2. There was a general air of indifference to the project - but a desire to see local rail services improved. Keith Smith, 81, said: âItâs costing an awful lot of money. Obviously improving journey times is a good thing but I'm not sure the benefits are worth the amount that is being spent. ""I would have thought they'd be better investing in the local infrastructure."" Meanwhile, Darren Wilson 49, from Hull, said: âBy the time itâs built here I probably wonât be alive.â He added: âThey need to make improvements to trains locally, rather than the ones going to London.â BBC Yorkshire's political editor tweets...

Greenpeace UK executive director John Sauven says introducing HS2 would mean the PM had ""the dubious honour of being this century's largest destroyer of ancient woodlands in the UK"". He adds: We're totally in favour of a transport revolution that cuts pollution and carbon emissions, but bulldozing through irreplaceable wildlife and nature sites is not the way to go about it.  Over 100 ancient woodlands will be damaged or destroyed along with 33 sites of special scientific interests and hundreds of local wildlife sites. Giving the go-ahead to such a costly and damaging project is a missed opportunity. The prime minister should have created a first-class regional rail and bus service, up and running across the north in years rather than decades and without adding to the climate and nature emergency.  Steve Rotheram, Metro Mayor for the Liverpool City Region, says the decision announced today is welcome ""but falls short of the full and unequivocal commitment to both HS2 and Northern Powerhouse Rail that the north needs"". He adds: I will continue to push â alongside my fellow Northern leaders â for delivery of the new west-east rail line, fully integrated with HS2, that our city region needs.  Improving rail connectivity is vitally important but, for the vast majority of people, transport is not about big national schemes, they want a local transport system they can rely on every day. Thatâs why later this month I will be announcing my plans to improve our local bus services, as part of my wider ambition to build a London-style transport system for our area.

""The certainty provided by government will give the sector confidence to invest in much-needed innovation, put in place longer-term financing and take a strategic view of the future.â Richard Scott, partner at Accuracy, added: âHS2 is enormously important to UK contractors and subcontractors, as it is one of just a few major infrastructure projects that the sector is relying on, along with Heathrow expansion and new nuclear. âGiving the line the green light also signals the end to the likelihood of government being caught in years of wrangling over early termination of contracts, and reinstating land on which work has already begun.â While lots of Business Live readers seem unhappy with today's HS2 news, here are some positive views. Alan Lewis says: ""This is a great - and much needed - development for public
transport in our country. It will add considerably capacity to the completely
full rail lines between Birmingham and London. It will take fast inter-city
trains off our old Victorian rail lines and allow room for extra commuter, regional
and freight trains. This should be welcomed by all travellers, businesses and
environmentalists as it will provide additional low carbon transport, which is
much better than building more roads."" Meanwhile John Griffiths says: ""I live in rural Buckinghamshire, about four miles from the
proposed route. It wonât benefit me directly at all but to oppose it is
short-sighted."" Why? ""We will all benefit from the building of this railway,
which will bring much-needed investment and jobs to the economy at a time when

"This video can not be played Tonique Kerr's husband Reshawn Davis was told he would not be on the flight on Monday night A Home Office flight deporting convicted offenders to Jamaica has left the UK, despite a last-minute legal challenge. Downing Street said 17 people were deported, but 25 others had been stopped because of the court order. The court ruling cameon Monday night after concerns that some detainees may not have had access to legal advice. One woman, whose husband was taken off the flight, said there was confusion over what would happen next. All of those being deported are Jamaican nationals who have been convicted of criminal offences and given prison sentences of 12 months or more. In a statement, the prime minister's spokesman said ""we bitterly regret"" the court decision that stopped the 25 people from leaving, and will urgently appeal. ""The offences which these people were responsible for include one manslaughter, one firearms offence, seven violent offences, two which are in the category of rape or sexual offences and 14 drugs offences,"" the spokesman said. He added: ""We make no apology whatsoever for seeking to remove serious foreign national offenders."" Campaigners 'delighted' by Jamaica flight court ruling On Monday,a Court of Appeal judge ruledthe government should not deport detainees from Colnbrooke and Harmondsworth detention centres, near Heathrow, after lawyers argued mobile phone signal problems meant some of the detainees could not get legal advice. The ruling said the government must not deport anyone from those centres unless they had access to a functioning, non-O2 Sim card on or before 3 February. There had been calls for the government to suspend the flight until a report on the Windrush scandal has been published. A leaked draft of the report said the government should consider ending the deportation of foreign-born offenders who came to the UK as children. Campaigners argued that most of the detainees due to be deported had spent the majority of their lives in Britain. Campaigners protested against the flight outside Downing Street on Monday Bella Sankey, director of charity Detention Action, told the BBC News Channel: ""In these cases where people have been here for a long time and are to all intents and purposes British, by deporting individuals like that you are doubly punishing them. ""For many of these individuals deportation is a much harsher sentence than the time they've already served. Imagine being forever banished from the country you grew up in, unable to visit all of your close family and friends."" Immigration lawyer Jacqueline Mckenzie told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme: ""There needs to be a moral debate about this because it cannot be right that we are picking up people in their 30s who arrived at two... and sending them to countries that they don't know, leaving behind all their family."" Call to review foreign-born offender deportations Windrush row over criminal deportation flight Government under pressure over Jamaica flight Tottenham MP David Lammy said it was an ""outrage"" that the flight had departed. ""The government wants to give the impression that everyone who was deported was a hardened violent criminal, but the reality is many of those who were scheduled to be deported had committed non-violent, one-time drugs offences. ""The lessons from Windrush have not been learned. Lives are being ruined because we don't remember our history."" Tonique Kerr said her husband, Reshawn Davis, who has been in the UK for 20 years, was among those told on Monday that he would not be on the flight. ""We don't know what's happening,"" she told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme. Ms Kerr said her husband had been sentenced to 14 months in prison - although only served two months - under the controversial joint enterprise law, after two mobile phones were stolen and he was ""just there when it happened"". ""He came [to the UK] when he was 11,"" she said. ""He's not actually been back since he's come to this country. He's now 30, he's spent most of his life here."" Shabana Mahmood MP said one of her constituents had also been taken off the flight. ""He actually served in the British Armed Forces,"" she said. ""He did two tours of Afghanistan, when he came back he suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder. ""He was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and that sort of began the deterioration of his mental health, after which he was convicted for GBH. ""His mental health has continued to deteriorate and his argument has always been: he's served this country, he hasn't had help for the PTSD he picked up as a serving soldier for our country. ""So it really goes to the heart of our notions of what it is to be a citizen."" The flight had been due to leave for Kingston at 6:30 GMT on Tuesday. Home Secretary Priti Patel said those on the flight included serious offenders Chancellor Sajid Javid said no-one protected by the court ruling was on the flight. ""It is absolutely right that when they have served their sentence that we send them out of the country,"" Mr Javid told BBC Radio 5 Live on Tuesday morning. ""They are not British nationals, they are not members of the Windrush generation, they are all foreign national offenders."" On Tuesday, the Home Office said: ""Today 17 serious foreign criminals were deported from the UK. They were convicted of rape, violent crimes and drug offences and had a combined sentence length of 75 years, as well as a life sentence. ""We make no apology whatsoever for seeking to remove dangerous foreign criminals. ""We will be urgently pursuing the removal of those who were prevented from boarding the flight due to a legal challenge over a mobile network failure."" And the PM's spokesman said: ""The legal process for removing these offenders - which has included repeated appeals and judicial reviews - has already cost the British public tens of thousands of pounds. ""The taxpayer will now be left with an even bigger bill and the prospect of convicts who are considered to pose a threat to the UK being granted bail while this matter is resolved."" The Home Office complied with the court order One of those who had been due to be deported on Tuesday is father-of-five Howard Ormsby. He was jailed for 18 months after he was convicted of possession with intent to supply class A drugs and he was released in December. ""I came here at the age of 15 with my older sister and I've been here 18 years of my life,"" the 32-year-old said, speaking to the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire show from a detention centre at Harmondsworth, west London. ""I've never tried to deny the fact I've made a mistake, but everyone has a chance to right their wrongs. ""I have all my family here - I have no-one in Jamaica.""

"Manchester's plans for HS2, revealed in 2018, include a major upgrade of Piccadilly station The HS2 rail project, which will cut travel times from Manchester to London, could be ""a waste of money"", commuters in the northern city have said. The government isset to approve the project's two stages, though the second one linking Manchester and Birmingham will be reviewed. Manchester passengers said they worried about its environmental costs and the lack of a solution to existing issues. However, the city's council leader said it was ""very, very good news"". Sir Richard Leese added that the UK had ""vastly under-invested in infrastructure for probably half a century and I think we need to adjust our cash registers to recognise we need this investment"". Paul Fletcher said money should be spent improving the existing network At the city's Piccadilly railway station, insurance broker Paul Fletcher said the government ""would be far better spending [the money set aside for it] on improving the lines we've already got"". ""What a waste of money,"" he said. The 49-year-old, who lives in Hyde, Greater Manchester, said he was also concerned about the potential impact on the proposed Northern Powerhouse Rail project,which would improve links from between the West and East coasts. ""Who knows what will happen when they review the line to Manchester and Leeds?"" he said. ""It seems the North is again getting a raw deal."" Ron Baldwin said the government ""should be putting money into normal trains"" Retired engineer Ron Baldwin was in agreement. The 75-year-old had just travelled for nearly two hours from his home in Brough, Cumbria and said that ""yet again, the North seems to be taking a back seat"". ""I am very sceptical that this will ever happen - the costs just seem to be endless. ""They should be putting money into normal trains- I doubt we'll ever see the benefit where I live."" Anne Butterworth was worried about the environmental impact Administrator Anne Butterworth, 56, was also concerned about local services. ""I regularly travel on smaller commuter trains; that's where the money needs going, not HS2,"" she said. ""However, what I really worry about is the environmental impact. Wildlife will suffer because of this. ""They will be knocking down ancient forest to build this and damaging wetlands. I thought we were supposed to be preserving them for the future generation, not harming them."" ""They would be better off spending the money on existing infrastructure,"" Jade Fuller said Southampton-based project manager Jade Fuller, who regularly travels between London and Manchester for work, said she was also concerned about the environmental and financial costs for what could be minimal gain. ""It seems an awful lot of money to spend just to save 20 minutes to get to London,"" the 35-year-old said. ""They would be better off spending the money on existing infrastructure - that's what's really needed."" However, Manchester lawyer Cameron Iqbal, 35, tentatively welcomed the announcement. ""In theory, I think it's a worthwhile project [as] investing in our trains is a good idea, but I do also think they should put more money into our existing trains,"" he said. ""The commuter trains need improving too."" Sir Richard said the project must be ""properly integrated"" with Northern Powerhouse Rail Sir Richard told BBC Radio Manchester it was ""about time"" HS2 got the go-ahead. ""Virtually anywhere else in Europe would have had it built by now,"" he said. ""It's capacity we will need for the rest of this century and beyond, and the fact it's going to go ahead is very, very good news for Manchester and indeed the whole of the North. ""All of our commuter lines are full and there's no room for freight on the existing network, so taking the long-distance trains off the existing network and putting them on their own network means we will have more and more reliable services between Manchester, Birmingham and London and across to Liverpool, Bradford and Leeds."" However, he added that the project needed to be ""properly integrated"" with Northern Powerhouse Rail. ""As a country, we've vastly under-invested in infrastructure for probably half a century and I think we need to adjust our cash registers to recognise we need this investment."" In a statement, Connecting Britain said the North ""needs new rail lines that go north-south and west-east"". The coalition of northern business and political leaders, which includes Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham, said London ""isn't being forced to choose, it's getting Crossrail and HS2"". ""We need HS2 and Northern Powerhouse Rail delivered in full [and] we will not accept a gold-plated high-speed line between London and Birmingham, then once again the North getting the scraps.""

"The government has pledged Â£5bn over the next five years to improve bus and cycling services in England. Boris Johnson said the extra money will provide more frequent services and simpler, more affordable fares. Mr Johnson told MPs that investments in local infrastructure would ""improve quality of life and productivity"". But Labour said the PM's plan ""doesn't make up for deep cuts since 2010"" that have led to thousands of route closures. The announcement comes as the government gave the go-ahead to the HS2 project. Plans for first all-electric bus town revealed Cycling lessons for all children plan Bus funding: Where would it help the most? Mr Johnson set out details of the high speed rail link and the new money for cycling and buses in a statement to the Commons. In addition to improving frequency and fares, he said the Â£5bn of funding will go towards new priority routes for buses and 4,000 ""zero-carbon"" buses in England and Wales. This video can not be played The Cornwall teenager with a two hour bus commute Other planned improvements include: More evening and weekend services to make it easier for people to get around outside peak hours A ""simpler, cheaper and more convenient"" ticketing system for buses Priority schemes to allow buses to pass quickly through congested roads In September, ministers announced Â£220m in extra funding to boost the bus network in England. They hope the cash will enable operators to restore recently withdrawn services, to give passengers in rural areas more choice and to increase the use of contactless payments. Further details will be announced in a new National Bus Strategy to be published later this year. Mr Johnson told MPs that the government's investment plan ""must be local"" to connect left-behind places to the rest of the country. ""We can unite and level up across the country with fantastic local improvements. better rail, less congested roads, beautiful British-built buses, cleaner, greener, quicker, safer, more frequent,"" he said. ""Above all, we can improve the quality of life for people and improve their productivity, make places more attractive to live in and invest in."" Responding to the prime minister, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn described Mr Johnson's plan as ""piecemeal"" and said the planned investment ""doesn't make up for deep cuts since 2010"" in bus services. ""Funding for buses has fallen by Â£645m a year since 2010, 3,300 routes cut or withdrawn and fares have soared,"" he said. ""It's councils that keep bus routes open. We need long-term funding for the local authorities that have suffered such severe cuts and now face a further Â£8bn black hole over this Parliament."" British Chambers of Commerce director general, Adam Marshall, welcomed the funding and said: ""Business communities will want to work with central government, local government and bus operators to ensure that this new funding makes a real difference on the ground.""

"Manchester's plans for HS2, revealed in 2018, include a major upgrade of Piccadilly station The HS2 rail project, which will cut travel times from Manchester to London, could be ""a waste of money"", commuters in the northern city have said. The government isset to approve the project's two stages, though the second one linking Manchester and Birmingham will be reviewed. Manchester passengers said they worried about its environmental costs and the lack of a solution to existing issues. However, the city's council leader said it was ""very, very good news"". Sir Richard Leese added that the UK had ""vastly under-invested in infrastructure for probably half a century and I think we need to adjust our cash registers to recognise we need this investment"". Paul Fletcher said money should be spent improving the existing network At the city's Piccadilly railway station, insurance broker Paul Fletcher said the government ""would be far better spending [the money set aside for it] on improving the lines we've already got"". ""What a waste of money,"" he said. The 49-year-old, who lives in Hyde, Greater Manchester, said he was also concerned about the potential impact on the proposed Northern Powerhouse Rail project,which would improve links from between the West and East coasts. ""Who knows what will happen when they review the line to Manchester and Leeds?"" he said. ""It seems the North is again getting a raw deal."" Ron Baldwin said the government ""should be putting money into normal trains"" Retired engineer Ron Baldwin was in agreement. The 75-year-old had just travelled for nearly two hours from his home in Brough, Cumbria and said that ""yet again, the North seems to be taking a back seat"". ""I am very sceptical that this will ever happen - the costs just seem to be endless. ""They should be putting money into normal trains- I doubt we'll ever see the benefit where I live."" Anne Butterworth was worried about the environmental impact Administrator Anne Butterworth, 56, was also concerned about local services. ""I regularly travel on smaller commuter trains; that's where the money needs going, not HS2,"" she said. ""However, what I really worry about is the environmental impact. Wildlife will suffer because of this. ""They will be knocking down ancient forest to build this and damaging wetlands. I thought we were supposed to be preserving them for the future generation, not harming them."" ""They would be better off spending the money on existing infrastructure,"" Jade Fuller said Southampton-based project manager Jade Fuller, who regularly travels between London and Manchester for work, said she was also concerned about the environmental and financial costs for what could be minimal gain. ""It seems an awful lot of money to spend just to save 20 minutes to get to London,"" the 35-year-old said. ""They would be better off spending the money on existing infrastructure - that's what's really needed."" However, Manchester lawyer Cameron Iqbal, 35, tentatively welcomed the announcement. ""In theory, I think it's a worthwhile project [as] investing in our trains is a good idea, but I do also think they should put more money into our existing trains,"" he said. ""The commuter trains need improving too."" Sir Richard said the project must be ""properly integrated"" with Northern Powerhouse Rail Sir Richard told BBC Radio Manchester it was ""about time"" HS2 got the go-ahead. ""Virtually anywhere else in Europe would have had it built by now,"" he said. ""It's capacity we will need for the rest of this century and beyond, and the fact it's going to go ahead is very, very good news for Manchester and indeed the whole of the North. ""All of our commuter lines are full and there's no room for freight on the existing network, so taking the long-distance trains off the existing network and putting them on their own network means we will have more and more reliable services between Manchester, Birmingham and London and across to Liverpool, Bradford and Leeds."" However, he added that the project needed to be ""properly integrated"" with Northern Powerhouse Rail. ""As a country, we've vastly under-invested in infrastructure for probably half a century and I think we need to adjust our cash registers to recognise we need this investment."" In a statement, Connecting Britain said the North ""needs new rail lines that go north-south and west-east"". The coalition of northern business and political leaders, which includes Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham, said London ""isn't being forced to choose, it's getting Crossrail and HS2"". ""We need HS2 and Northern Powerhouse Rail delivered in full [and] we will not accept a gold-plated high-speed line between London and Birmingham, then once again the North getting the scraps.""

"The government has pledged Â£5bn over the next five years to improve bus and cycling services in England. Boris Johnson said the extra money will provide more frequent services and simpler, more affordable fares. Mr Johnson told MPs that investments in local infrastructure would ""improve quality of life and productivity"". But Labour said the PM's plan ""doesn't make up for deep cuts since 2010"" that have led to thousands of route closures. The announcement comes as the government gave the go-ahead to the HS2 project. Plans for first all-electric bus town revealed Cycling lessons for all children plan Bus funding: Where would it help the most? Mr Johnson set out details of the high speed rail link and the new money for cycling and buses in a statement to the Commons. In addition to improving frequency and fares, he said the Â£5bn of funding will go towards new priority routes for buses and 4,000 ""zero-carbon"" buses in England and Wales. This video can not be played The Cornwall teenager with a two hour bus commute Other planned improvements include: More evening and weekend services to make it easier for people to get around outside peak hours A ""simpler, cheaper and more convenient"" ticketing system for buses Priority schemes to allow buses to pass quickly through congested roads In September, ministers announced Â£220m in extra funding to boost the bus network in England. They hope the cash will enable operators to restore recently withdrawn services, to give passengers in rural areas more choice and to increase the use of contactless payments. Further details will be announced in a new National Bus Strategy to be published later this year. Mr Johnson told MPs that the government's investment plan ""must be local"" to connect left-behind places to the rest of the country. ""We can unite and level up across the country with fantastic local improvements. better rail, less congested roads, beautiful British-built buses, cleaner, greener, quicker, safer, more frequent,"" he said. ""Above all, we can improve the quality of life for people and improve their productivity, make places more attractive to live in and invest in."" Responding to the prime minister, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn described Mr Johnson's plan as ""piecemeal"" and said the planned investment ""doesn't make up for deep cuts since 2010"" in bus services. ""Funding for buses has fallen by Â£645m a year since 2010, 3,300 routes cut or withdrawn and fares have soared,"" he said. ""It's councils that keep bus routes open. We need long-term funding for the local authorities that have suffered such severe cuts and now face a further Â£8bn black hole over this Parliament."" British Chambers of Commerce director general, Adam Marshall, welcomed the funding and said: ""Business communities will want to work with central government, local government and bus operators to ensure that this new funding makes a real difference on the ground.""

"This video can not be played Johnson: Cabinet has given HS2 ""green signal"" Prime Minister Boris Johnson has announced that the controversial HS2 high-speed rail link will be built. The first phase of the route will travel between London and Birmingham, with a second phase going to Manchester and Leeds. ""It has been a controversial and difficult decision,"" Mr Johnson said. The prime minister added he was going to appoint a full-time minister to oversee the project and criticised the HS2 company's management of the scheme. ""I cannot say that HS2 limited has distinguished itself in the handling of local communities. The cost forecasts have exploded, but poor management to date has not detracted from the fundamental value of the project."" The prime minister said that a series of measures would be taken to ""restore discipline to the programme"". Supporters of HS2 say it will improve transport times, increase capacity, create jobs and rebalance the UK's economy. Once it is built, journeys will be shorter. London to Birmingham travel times will be cut from one hour, 21 minutes to 52 minutes, according to the Department for Transport. And while it is being built, it is expected to create thousands of jobs and provide a stimulus to economic growth. The first phase of the high-speed rail link between London and Birmingham was due to open at the end of 2026. But Transport Secretary Grant Shapps told MPs in September thatthe first trains may not run on the route until some time between 2028 and 2031. The second phase to Manchester and Leeds was due to open in 2032-33, but that has been pushed back to 2035-40. However, Mr Johnson told MPs that he hoped if work started immediately that trains ""could be running by the end of the decade"". Mixed reaction from MPs on HS2 route How much? Six reasons why HS2 is so expensive HS2 in Manchester: 'Waste of money' or 'good news'? The spiralling cost of the project has sparked a backlash. The cost set out in the 2015 Budget was set at just under Â£56bn, but one independent estimate puts the cost as high as Â£106bn. Mr Johnson added: ""We will, in line with the review, investigate the current costs to identify where savings can be made in phase one without a total redesign."" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said Mr Johnson did not deserve praise for giving the project the go-ahead. ""The Labour Party supports HS2 as a means to boost regional economies and slash climate emissions. It is essential for boosting rail capacity and freeing up other lines,"" he said. ""But we don't see why the government should get a slap on the back for announcing it is going ahead. ""After all, it's only because of the abject failure of successive Conservative governments to keep on top of the costs, that the project's future was in any doubt.""

The village hall in Burton Green is also due to be torn down for HS2 Meanwhile, residents of a Warwickshire village admitted they were resigned to the final decision to build the rail line - even though it will split their lives in half. Burton Green village, home to 640 people,will effectively be bisected by the line. Rona Taylor, who runs the village's residents' association, said: ""It's a very frustrating day because we have opposed this for 10 years.""

Green Party MP Caroline Lucas said HS2 would ""destroy or damage hundreds of important wildlife sites, areas of ancient woodland and local nature reserves"". Jude Brimble, national secretary of the GMB trade union, which represents HS2 workers, said: ""The reality is that HS2 is happening and the government should get on with it. ""Thousands of skilled jobs depend on the project in construction and the supply chain."" Matthew Fell, of UK employers' group the CBI, said the decision to back HS2 was ""exactly the sort of bold, decisive action required to inject confidence in the economy"". He added: ""It sends the right signal around the world that the UK is open for business. HS2 shows the government's commitment to levelling up the nations and regions of the UK."" Stephen Phipson, chief executive of manufacturers' organisation Make UK, said: ""Industry will applaud this bold, sensible and pragmatic decision which will help change the country for the better.

"HS2 platforms in Manchester Piccadilly would be covered by a folded roof The HS2 high-speed rail link between Birmingham and Manchester will be scrapped, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has said. Another part of the route, between the East Midlands and Leeds,has already been cancelled. Instead, Â£36bn funding will be put into alternative transport projects, Mr Sunak said. HS2 was intended to create high-speed rail links between London and major cities in the Midlands and North of England. That has been pared down to a high-speed link between Birmingham and London. It is aimed at cutting journey times, creating more space on the rail network and more jobs outside London. But HS2 has faced delays, spiralling costs and cuts. HS2 was meant to connectLondonwithBirmingham,ManchesterandLeeds. Lots of work has been done on the section linking London and Birmingham. Butthe government scrapped the Leeds leg in 2021,external. It decided to upgrade existing routes for HS2 trains, instead of building new ones. In June, the government said it would still build HS2 from London Euston to Manchester and the East Midlands. However,Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said recently that costs were getting ""totally out of control"". Now, thealready-delayedBirmingham to Manchester leg has been cancelled. The 13-mile (21km) Golborne Link to connect HS2 and the West Coast Main Line in Cheshire and Greater Manchesterhad already been scrapped. Speaking at the Conservative party conference, Mr Sunak said the latest decision would save Â£36bn, which would be used instead in ""hundreds of new transport projects in the North and the Midlands, and across the country"". This will include road and rail schemes. HS2 will now eventually run from London to Birmingham Interchange, with branches to central Birmingham and Handsacre, near Lichfield. HS2 trains for Manchester, Liverpool and Scotland will join the West Coast Main Line at Handsacre. The government previously said HS2 would cut Birmingham to London journey times from one hour 21 minutes, to 52 minutes. Before the link was scrapped, HS2 was projected to take an hour off Manchester to London journeys - from just over two hours to just over one hour. HS2 trains will still run to Manchester, and journey times will be cut between Manchester, Birmingham and London by up to 30 minutes, Mr Sunak said. HS2 was originally meant to reach Euston in central London, although demolition work was paused due to rising costs. The government said it would ""get a grip"" on plans for the station's ""unaffordable designs"". It has already cut the number of planned platforms for high-speed trains from 11 to six. But if cash is not put forward by private investorsthen the high-speed line will only run from Birmingham to Old Oak Commonin London's western suburbs. It is unclear whether the same capacity across the line will be needed now the HS2 line to Manchester has been discarded. The cost of the project, the biggest of its kind in Europe, has grown. The first estimate in 2010 was for about Â£33bn. The government's most recent official estimate was about Â£71bn in 2019 prices. But this included Â£26bn for Birmingham to Manchester, which will now not be built. The government is currently updating its cost estimates. About Â£24.7bn had been spent on HS2 as of February 2023. This includes at least Â£22.5bn on Phase 1 and Â£2.3bn on Phase 2, including on the purchase of more than 400 properties between Birmingham and Manchester. HS2: Six reasons why the rail route is so expensive HS2 was due to open by 2026. Under current plans, HS2 trains would carry their first passengers between Old Oak Common and Birmingham, between 2029 and 2033. Timescales for when Euston will open have yet to be announced. The government has announced the ""Network North"" scheme, with Â£36bn redirected from HS2 to road and rail projects. This will allow the objectives of the previous ""Northern Powerhouse Rail"" project to be met, it said. ""Network North"" plans including upgraded and electrified lines between Manchester and Sheffield, Sheffield and Leeds, Sheffield and Hull, and Hull and Leeds. In addition, there will be an extra Â£12bn set aside for faster links between Liverpool and Manchester. A section of the HS2 line was due to run from Manchester Airport to Manchester Piccadilly, the city's main station. Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham recently said scrapping the Manchester link ""rips the heart"" out of Northern Powerhouse Rail. However, the government said Northern Powerhouse Rail, including high speed rail links, will be delivered ""as previously planned"". Big decisions await as HS2 row simmers on What is levelling up and who is it helping? Mr Sunak diverting money from HS2 to road schemes ""shows how little he really cares about tackling air pollution, traffic and cutting carbon emissions"", Greenpeace says. Previously the HS2 project said it could provide ""zero carbon rail travel"" and create new wildlife habitats along its route. But environmental campaigners and conservation organisations had objected, saying it would destroy irreplaceable natural habitats. How much?

"This video can not be played Johnson: Cabinet has given HS2 ""green signal"" Prime Minister Boris Johnson has announced that the controversial HS2 high-speed rail link will be built. The first phase of the route will travel between London and Birmingham, with a second phase going to Manchester and Leeds. ""It has been a controversial and difficult decision,"" Mr Johnson said. The prime minister added he was going to appoint a full-time minister to oversee the project and criticised the HS2 company's management of the scheme. ""I cannot say that HS2 limited has distinguished itself in the handling of local communities. The cost forecasts have exploded, but poor management to date has not detracted from the fundamental value of the project."" The prime minister said that a series of measures would be taken to ""restore discipline to the programme"". Supporters of HS2 say it will improve transport times, increase capacity, create jobs and rebalance the UK's economy. Once it is built, journeys will be shorter. London to Birmingham travel times will be cut from one hour, 21 minutes to 52 minutes, according to the Department for Transport. And while it is being built, it is expected to create thousands of jobs and provide a stimulus to economic growth. The first phase of the high-speed rail link between London and Birmingham was due to open at the end of 2026. But Transport Secretary Grant Shapps told MPs in September thatthe first trains may not run on the route until some time between 2028 and 2031. The second phase to Manchester and Leeds was due to open in 2032-33, but that has been pushed back to 2035-40. However, Mr Johnson told MPs that he hoped if work started immediately that trains ""could be running by the end of the decade"". Mixed reaction from MPs on HS2 route How much? Six reasons why HS2 is so expensive HS2 in Manchester: 'Waste of money' or 'good news'? The spiralling cost of the project has sparked a backlash. The cost set out in the 2015 Budget was set at just under Â£56bn, but one independent estimate puts the cost as high as Â£106bn. Mr Johnson added: ""We will, in line with the review, investigate the current costs to identify where savings can be made in phase one without a total redesign."" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said Mr Johnson did not deserve praise for giving the project the go-ahead. ""The Labour Party supports HS2 as a means to boost regional economies and slash climate emissions. It is essential for boosting rail capacity and freeing up other lines,"" he said. ""But we don't see why the government should get a slap on the back for announcing it is going ahead. ""After all, it's only because of the abject failure of successive Conservative governments to keep on top of the costs, that the project's future was in any doubt."" Ron and Anne Ryall have been ordered to leave their home next month Not everybody is benefitting from HS2 being given the go-ahead.

"This video can not be played Tonique Kerr's husband Reshawn Davis was told he would not be on the flight on Monday night A Home Office flight deporting convicted offenders to Jamaica has left the UK, despite a last-minute legal challenge. Downing Street said 17 people were deported, but 25 others had been stopped because of the court order. The court ruling cameon Monday night after concerns that some detainees may not have had access to legal advice. One woman, whose husband was taken off the flight, said there was confusion over what would happen next. All of those being deported are Jamaican nationals who have been convicted of criminal offences and given prison sentences of 12 months or more. In a statement, the prime minister's spokesman said ""we bitterly regret"" the court decision that stopped the 25 people from leaving, and will urgently appeal. ""The offences which these people were responsible for include one manslaughter, one firearms offence, seven violent offences, two which are in the category of rape or sexual offences and 14 drugs offences,"" the spokesman said. He added: ""We make no apology whatsoever for seeking to remove serious foreign national offenders."" Campaigners 'delighted' by Jamaica flight court ruling On Monday,a Court of Appeal judge ruledthe government should not deport detainees from Colnbrooke and Harmondsworth detention centres, near Heathrow, after lawyers argued mobile phone signal problems meant some of the detainees could not get legal advice. The ruling said the government must not deport anyone from those centres unless they had access to a functioning, non-O2 Sim card on or before 3 February. There had been calls for the government to suspend the flight until a report on the Windrush scandal has been published. A leaked draft of the report said the government should consider ending the deportation of foreign-born offenders who came to the UK as children. Campaigners argued that most of the detainees due to be deported had spent the majority of their lives in Britain. Campaigners protested against the flight outside Downing Street on Monday Bella Sankey, director of charity Detention Action, told the BBC News Channel: ""In these cases where people have been here for a long time and are to all intents and purposes British, by deporting individuals like that you are doubly punishing them. ""For many of these individuals deportation is a much harsher sentence than the time they've already served. Imagine being forever banished from the country you grew up in, unable to visit all of your close family and friends."" Immigration lawyer Jacqueline Mckenzie told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme: ""There needs to be a moral debate about this because it cannot be right that we are picking up people in their 30s who arrived at two... and sending them to countries that they don't know, leaving behind all their family."" Call to review foreign-born offender deportations Windrush row over criminal deportation flight Government under pressure over Jamaica flight Tottenham MP David Lammy said it was an ""outrage"" that the flight had departed. ""The government wants to give the impression that everyone who was deported was a hardened violent criminal, but the reality is many of those who were scheduled to be deported had committed non-violent, one-time drugs offences. ""The lessons from Windrush have not been learned. Lives are being ruined because we don't remember our history."" Tonique Kerr said her husband, Reshawn Davis, who has been in the UK for 20 years, was among those told on Monday that he would not be on the flight. ""We don't know what's happening,"" she told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme. Ms Kerr said her husband had been sentenced to 14 months in prison - although only served two months - under the controversial joint enterprise law, after two mobile phones were stolen and he was ""just there when it happened"". ""He came [to the UK] when he was 11,"" she said. ""He's not actually been back since he's come to this country. He's now 30, he's spent most of his life here."" Shabana Mahmood MP said one of her constituents had also been taken off the flight. ""He actually served in the British Armed Forces,"" she said. ""He did two tours of Afghanistan, when he came back he suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder. ""He was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and that sort of began the deterioration of his mental health, after which he was convicted for GBH. ""His mental health has continued to deteriorate and his argument has always been: he's served this country, he hasn't had help for the PTSD he picked up as a serving soldier for our country. ""So it really goes to the heart of our notions of what it is to be a citizen."" The flight had been due to leave for Kingston at 6:30 GMT on Tuesday. Home Secretary Priti Patel said those on the flight included serious offenders Chancellor Sajid Javid said no-one protected by the court ruling was on the flight. ""It is absolutely right that when they have served their sentence that we send them out of the country,"" Mr Javid told BBC Radio 5 Live on Tuesday morning. ""They are not British nationals, they are not members of the Windrush generation, they are all foreign national offenders."" On Tuesday, the Home Office said: ""Today 17 serious foreign criminals were deported from the UK. They were convicted of rape, violent crimes and drug offences and had a combined sentence length of 75 years, as well as a life sentence. ""We make no apology whatsoever for seeking to remove dangerous foreign criminals. ""We will be urgently pursuing the removal of those who were prevented from boarding the flight due to a legal challenge over a mobile network failure."" And the PM's spokesman said: ""The legal process for removing these offenders - which has included repeated appeals and judicial reviews - has already cost the British public tens of thousands of pounds. ""The taxpayer will now be left with an even bigger bill and the prospect of convicts who are considered to pose a threat to the UK being granted bail while this matter is resolved."" The Home Office complied with the court order One of those who had been due to be deported on Tuesday is father-of-five Howard Ormsby. He was jailed for 18 months after he was convicted of possession with intent to supply class A drugs and he was released in December. ""I came here at the age of 15 with my older sister and I've been here 18 years of my life,"" the 32-year-old said, speaking to the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire show from a detention centre at Harmondsworth, west London. ""I've never tried to deny the fact I've made a mistake, but everyone has a chance to right their wrongs. ""I have all my family here - I have no-one in Jamaica.""

"The government has pledged Â£5bn over the next five years to improve bus and cycling services in England. Boris Johnson said the extra money will provide more frequent services and simpler, more affordable fares. Mr Johnson told MPs that investments in local infrastructure would ""improve quality of life and productivity"". But Labour said the PM's plan ""doesn't make up for deep cuts since 2010"" that have led to thousands of route closures. The announcement comes as the government gave the go-ahead to the HS2 project. Plans for first all-electric bus town revealed Cycling lessons for all children plan Bus funding: Where would it help the most? Mr Johnson set out details of the high speed rail link and the new money for cycling and buses in a statement to the Commons. In addition to improving frequency and fares, he said the Â£5bn of funding will go towards new priority routes for buses and 4,000 ""zero-carbon"" buses in England and Wales. This video can not be played The Cornwall teenager with a two hour bus commute Other planned improvements include: More evening and weekend services to make it easier for people to get around outside peak hours A ""simpler, cheaper and more convenient"" ticketing system for buses Priority schemes to allow buses to pass quickly through congested roads In September, ministers announced Â£220m in extra funding to boost the bus network in England. They hope the cash will enable operators to restore recently withdrawn services, to give passengers in rural areas more choice and to increase the use of contactless payments. Further details will be announced in a new National Bus Strategy to be published later this year. Mr Johnson told MPs that the government's investment plan ""must be local"" to connect left-behind places to the rest of the country. ""We can unite and level up across the country with fantastic local improvements. better rail, less congested roads, beautiful British-built buses, cleaner, greener, quicker, safer, more frequent,"" he said. ""Above all, we can improve the quality of life for people and improve their productivity, make places more attractive to live in and invest in."" Responding to the prime minister, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn described Mr Johnson's plan as ""piecemeal"" and said the planned investment ""doesn't make up for deep cuts since 2010"" in bus services. ""Funding for buses has fallen by Â£645m a year since 2010, 3,300 routes cut or withdrawn and fares have soared,"" he said. ""It's councils that keep bus routes open. We need long-term funding for the local authorities that have suffered such severe cuts and now face a further Â£8bn black hole over this Parliament."" British Chambers of Commerce director general, Adam Marshall, welcomed the funding and said: ""Business communities will want to work with central government, local government and bus operators to ensure that this new funding makes a real difference on the ground."" On cycling, Mr Johnson promised to create ""hundreds of miles"" of new cycle paths and plans to make cycling safer in towns by expanding projects dubbed ""mini Holland"" schemes. The aim of creating ""low-traffic neighbourhoods"" outside of London is part of government plans to double rates of cycling by the 2025. There are plans for more evening and weekend services Campaign group the Walking and Cycling Alliance said ""the emphasis on quality infrastructure is to be applauded"" and that it hoped to work with other groups to ""ensure that this investment is the start of a real transformation in how we get around"". A spokesperson added: ""It has never been more important to make it easier to walk and cycle - to tackle climate change, poor air quality, crippling congestion, and the mental and physical health of the nation. ""The evidence is clear and people want to do it, what has been lacking is the investment and ambition to make it safe and easy for everyone.""

"A proposed design for an HS2 train The government is set to approve the controversial High Speed 2 (HS2) rail project, the BBC has learned. An announcement on the route linking London to Birmingham, and then on to Manchester and Leeds, is expected by the prime minister on Tuesday. Supporters of the plan say it will improve transport times, create jobs and rebalance the UK's economy. But the rising cost of the project and accusations of mismanagement have provoked anger from critics. HS2 - which is due to be completed by 2040 - is already over budget and behind schedule. The government is expected to approve the whole line. However, it will try to make changes to the second phase of the project - the routes to Manchester and Leeds - to save money. Adam Marshall, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, told the BBC the train line would help cut overcrowding: ""We need a better backbone for our public transport services, ""The capacity HS2 is going to deliver is absolutely crucial."" Many smaller businesses have also welcomed the plan. Lee Kemp, who runs Vermillion Films in Birmingham, which makes corporate training films, said HS2 is ""really good news for us as a city and as a region"". ""With this actually moving forward people can start making plans around it,"" he told the BBC. Latest reaction to HS2 go-ahead How much? Six reasons why HS2 is so expensive What is the HS2 route and how much will it cost? Just how blow-out is the HS2 budget? HS2 costs out of control, says review's deputy chair However, the building of HS2 has also had its casualties. Ron and Anne Ryallhave been ordered to leave their home in March,because it is on the planned route and is due to be demolished. Ron told the BBC:,external""It's completely wrecked our lives. I'm finding it difficult that someone can just walk into your life and destroy it. My family has lived in this lane for 100 years. I was born here."" A source close to the project has confirmed that Boris Johnson will also announcea series of other transport projectson Tuesday. The projects are aimed at answering critics who fear the high cost of HS2 will mean other infrastructure projects are sidelined. Some of them will be situated in the north of England and the Midlands as part of the government's manifesto promise to ""level up"" the UK by investing more in regions outside of London. This video can not be played HS2: How much work has already been done? Approving the plan could be seen as a risky move for Mr Johnson as there has been opposition to the scheme within the Conservative Party. His chief adviser Dominic Cummings called HS2 a ""disaster zone"" last summer, while several MPs who represent constituencies that could be affected by the building works are also against the project. Transport SecretaryGrant Shapps has defended the right of Tory MPs to oppose the plan,saying they were entitled to represent the views of their constituents. Former Conservative cabinet minister David Lidington, said he feared HS2 was ""20th Century technology and infrastructure for a 21st Century economy"". Labour peer Lord Berkeley - former deputy chairman of the project's independent review - said HS2 would not help commuters in the north, but would be good for people travelling between London and Birmingham. Environmental groups say HS2 will boost carbon emissions and spoil areas of natural beauty. In 2015, it was estimated that the cost of HS2 would be Â£56bn, but a review has warned that it could rise to as much as Â£106bn. Work to prepare the ground for the first phase of HS2 linking London and Birmingham has been going on for years. But a green light from the government means construction of the railway will begin relatively soon. It is also expected that work on the line between Birmingham and Crewe will be rolled into the first phase. It had originally been slated to begin at a later stage. Construction on the second phase of the project, originally planned to link Crewe to Manchester and Birmingham with Leeds, is at a much earlier stage. The BBC has been told that the government will commission a further review of this part of the line to find ways of making it more affordable. It also wants to ensure that these lines can be better integrated into the existing railway network along with other planned upgrades such as Northern Powerhouse Rail, which aims to improve east-west links across the north of England. This video can not be played Working on HS2: ""The opportunities are just immense"" The initial plan was for a new railway line between London and the West Midlands carrying 400m-long (1,300ft) trains, with as many as 1,100 seats per train. The line would enable trains to reach speeds of up to 250mph and would run as often as 14 times an hour in each direction. This would be followed by a V-shaped second phase taking services from Birmingham to Manchester and Leeds. Early work has begun on the first phase of HS2 The Department for Transport (DfT) has saidthat the project will triple the capacity of trains across the entire route. According to the latest estimates, the first stage would be completed between 2028 and 2031 - long after the original opening date of 2026. Meanwhile, the second stage would be ready in 2035-2040. The announcement on High Speed 2 broadly mirrors some of the main recommendations from the government's still unpublished review into the project. I've read the full report and it emphasises that any significant changes to the first phase of HS2, linking London to Birmingham, would have caused further delays. No-one in government wanted that. The Crewe to Manchester and Birmingham to Leeds phase will undergo another review because it is at such an early stage, and ministers believe savings can be found. They also want the high-speed lines to be better integrated with our existing rail network and future infrastructure projects. Politics and pledges to voters in the north of England and the Midlands was a big part of this decision. But so too was the amount of work which has already been done on the first phase of the project. Ultimately, the government felt that turning back wasn't an option. Its much higher price tag has made HS2 politically toxic, so the government is also announcing a massive cash injection for buses and cycling in England. I'm told that figures within government who weren't sold on HS2 wanted those other transport pledges at the same time. Essentially, because they were over-optimistic in the first place. The National Audit Office has warned in successive reports over a number of years thatHS2 had an ""unrealistic timetable"". In its most recent analysis, it said thatthe risks of the project were never properly assessedwhen initial costs were estimated. HS2 began under the Labour government in 2009, but the cost has continued to balloon under subsequent administrations. Once it is built, journeys will be shorter. London-to-Birmingham travel times will be cut from one hour 21 minutes to 52 minutes, according to the DfT. And while it is being built, it is expected to create thousands of jobs and provide a stimulus to economic growth. Darren Caplan, head of the Railway Industry Association. told the BBC that the line would also ""increase capacity on the East Coast Main Line, the Midlands Main Line and the West Coast Main Line.

"This video can not be played Ireland's elections: Five myths explained Fianna FÃ¡il has won the most seats in the Irish general election just one ahead of Sinn FÃ©in, who recorded a historic result. Sinn FÃ©in's haul of 37 seats is an increase of 14 on the 2016 election. Fine Gael, whose party leader Leo Varadkar led the outgoing government as taoiseach (Irish prime minister), finished with 35 seats, down 15 from four years ago. The tight numbers could lead to lengthy negotiations to form a government. The election results were confirmed shortly after midnight when two Fianna FÃ¡il candidates, Brendan Smith and Niamh Smyth, won the last two seats in Cavan-Monaghan. The final results showed that: Sinn FÃ©in had won 37 seats, an increase of 14 on the 2016 election Fianna FÃ¡il had lost six seats since 2016 but became the largest party by one seat Fine Gael lost 15 seats from 2016 The Green Party recorded their best ever election result, winning 12 seats - an improvement of 10 from 2016 The outcome was described as""something of a revolution in the ballot box""by Sinn FÃ©in leader Mary Lou McDonald. With all first preferences counted, the left-wing republican party has taken 24.5% of the vote, compared to 22% for Fianna FÃ¡il and 21% for Fine Gael. Before the election, both Fine Gael and Fianna FÃ¡il had ruled out forging a coalition with left-wing republican party Sinn FÃ©in, citing its tax policies and IRA past as deterrents. On Sunday, taoiseach (Irish PM) and Fine Gael leader Leo Varadkar conceded it would be ""challenging"" to form a government. Fianna FÃ¡il leader MicheÃ¡l Martin did not rule out working with Sinn FÃ©in, but said ""significant incompatibilities"" still existed. Sinn FÃ©in President Mary Lou McDonald, who topped the poll in her four-seat Dublin Central constituency, said Sinn FÃ©in wanted to be in government and was working to establish if the numbers were there to deliver it without Fianna FÃ¡il or Fine Gael. On Monday evening, she said she had not heard from the leaders of those two parties and has instead been speaking to Labour, the Green Party and other smaller parties that make up the DÃ¡il (Irish parliament). ""People want different politics, new politics and better government - a new government - and I believe Sinn FÃ©in will be the core of that,"" she told reporters in Dublin. ""I may well be the next taoiseach,"" she added. As it happened: Irish election results and analysis day two Who is Mary Lou McDonald?

""That consent can only be tested in a unity referendum and we are going to have a unity referendum - and I want us to do it in an orderly, thoughtful democratic and absolutely peaceful manner."" Sinn FÃ©in's vice-president, Michelle O'Neill, said the party would have ""asks in terms of the republican project"", in line with itsrepeated calls for the next government to prepare for Irish unity.

Sinn FÃ©in's best-ever result is the success story of this election. However, with how the overall votes have fallen, we know that Sinn FÃ©in will not necessarily end up in government despite its swathe of victories. The magic number for winning a majority government in the Republic of Ireland is 80 seats. None of the three big parties - Fine Gael, Fianna FÃ¡il and now Sinn FÃ©in - will come close to that figure. Attempts to form a new coalition-of-sorts will formally get under way, although this will be complex.

Fine Gael has been in government since 2011, firstly with the Labour Party and then with independents and since 2016, a confidence-and-supply deal with Fianna FÃ¡il. It looks set to lose seats for the second election in a row, but that does not necessarily rule it out of forming another government. Its share of first preference votes dropped from 25.5% at the last election to 20.9%. The taoiseach said he was ""not really"" disappointed that he did not top the poll in his own constituency.

"There's been growing criticism of how authorities are handling the outbreak China has ""removed"" several senior officials over their handling of the coronavirus outbreak - as the death toll passed 1,000. The party secretary for the Hubei Health Commission, and the head of the commission, are the most senior officials to be demoted so far. The deputy director of the local Red Cross was also removed for ""dereliction of duty"" over ""handling of donations"". Meanwhile the World Health Organization has named the virus Covid-19. The WHO is holding a two-day meeting in Geneva involving top medical, scientific and public health experts, aimed at speeding up the global response to the outbreak. China launches coronavirus 'close contact' app Coronavirus prankster faces jail for metro stunt Coronavirus: 'I walk around my block of flats to stay sane' There are now more than 42,200 confirmed cases across China.The number of deaths has overtaken that of the Sars epidemic in 2003. On Monday, some 103 died in Hubei province alone, a daily record, and the national death toll is now 1,016. But the number of new infections nationally was down almost 20% from the day before, from 3,062 to 2,478. Speaking to Reuters news agency,leading Chinese respiratory expert Zhong Nanshan said the virus was hitting a peak in China this month,externaland that the outbreak may be over by April. He said he was basing the forecast on mathematical modelling, recent events and government action. However, Zhong's previous forecast of an earlier peak turned out to be premature. According to state media, there have been hundreds of sackings, investigations and warnings across Hubei and other provinces during the outbreak. But removal from a certain role - while regarded as a censure - does not always mean the person will be sacked entirely, as it can also mean demotion. As well as being removed from their posts, officials can also be punished by the ruling Communist Party. For example, the deputy head of the government-run Red Cross charity, Zhang Qin, was given ""a serious intra-Party warning as well as a serious administrative demerit"", state media said. The two Hubei party officials will be replaced by a national figure - the deputy director of China's National Health Commission, Wang Hesheng. Earlier this month, the deputy head of the Wuhan bureau of statistics was removed, with similar sanctions for ""violating relevant regulations to distribute face masks"". Coronavirus super-spreaders: Why are they important? How worried should we be? British coronavirus patient recovers from illness Coronavirus: Nissan to shut factory in Japan In recent days, Chinese authorities have increasingly been criticised for their handling of the crisis. The death of a doctor whose early warnings were suppressed by authoritiessparked widespread public anger. Beijing has sent a team from its highest anti-corruption agency to Hubei to investigate the treatment of Dr Li by police. But sources say at least 500 hospital staff had been infected,externalin Wuhan by mid-January, according to the South China Morning Post. Doctors and nurses had been told not to make the extent of infections public, it reports. Analysis by BBC China correspondent, Stephen McDonell, Beijing Somebody was always going to be for the chop following the shambolic early handling of the coronavirus emergency. That early response cost precious weeks, slowing the response while millions of people left Wuhan before the transport blockade was in place. It was only a question of who would go - and when. With the local authorities facing a storm of public anger, the top two officials in Hubei's provincial health commission have been dismissed. Nobody expects it to end there. Possibly sensing that his own head was already on the block, the mayor of Wuhan, Zhou Xianwang, said the reason it took so long to warn the public about the virus was that he didn't have clearance from above. Clearance from above? That could mean permission from the provincial party secretary. It could also be interpreted that he was directing the blame all the way to Beijing. Now that can mean either China's top leaders are partly at fault; or the Communist Party's governance structures need to be overhauled; or the mayor is wrong - that is, he is the one who ultimately should carry the blame. People can decide which of these options is most likely to be acknowledged and acted upon. More than three-quarters of the deaths have been in Hubei's provincial capital, Wuhan, the centre of the outbreak. The city of 11 million has been in lockdown for weeks. China has been sending large numbers of medical staff to the city.State news agency Xinhua shared images on Monday of doctors and nurses shaving their heads,externalto prepare for wearing protective clothing. However, health officials have warned that medical facilities in rural areas across the country are inadequate. In Hong Kong, 23 households were evacuated from an estate on Monday night and taken into quarantine, after cases were detected there. The territory has had months of protests and chief executive Carrie Lam has called for ""social cohesion"" in the face of the health crisis. Two Japanese citizens who were evacuated on government-chartered flights from Wuhan in January have now tested positive. Both men had previously tested negative for the virus but later displayed symptoms, according to media reports.

Thailand on Tuesday did not allow passengers from another cruise ship to disembark, despite no confirmed infections aboard. North Korea is reported to have sent hundreds of workers to patrol its borders with China. Road, rail and air links with China have already been cut. The country has not reported any infections but South Korean media say the virus has reached the secretive communist state. The main signs of infection are fever (high temperature) and a cough as well as shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. Frequent hand washing with soap or gel, avoiding close contact with people who are ill and not touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands, can help cut the risk of infection. Catching coughs and sneezes in a tissue, binning it and washing your hands can minimise the risk of spreading disease.

"The Post Office pursued Lee Castleton for losses A postmaster says the Post Office spent Â£320,000 suing him over Â£25,000 he was falsely accused of stealing. Lee Castleton, from Bridlington,  East Yorkshire, was made bankrupt after he lost a two-year legal battle with the Post Office. A recent ruling found problems with the Post Office's accountancy software could instead be to blame for the losses. The Post Office has apologised and accepts its ""past shortcomings"". For two decades, the Post Office pursued hundreds of its workers over accounting discrepancies with its Horizon IT system, accusing people of theft, fraud or false accounting. Many were fired, made bankrupt or even sent to prison. Mr Castleton described how he and his family were abused, including an incident where his daughter was spat at, because ""local people presumed I was a thief"". The former stockbroker, who bought a seafront Post Office branch in 2003, said he began to notice thousands of pounds in losses from his accounts within months of taking over the business. Despite calling the Post Office's helpline nearly every day for three months, he said: ""We just couldn't understand where the losses were coming from."" Following an audit, Mr Castleton's branch was found to have a Â£25,000 shortfall. He was subsequently suspended. The Post Office spent the next two years pursuing him for the missing money through the civil courts. ""The Post Office decided to make an example of me,"" said Mr Castleton. He was forced to defend himself in London's High Court because he had no money to hire a lawyer. When he lost the case, he was made bankrupt. Mr Castleton is now one of more than 550 former postmasters who will get a share of a Â£58m settlement from the Post Office. The agreement was reached in December last year, when the High Court ruled that technical problems with the Post Office's Horizon IT system could instead be to blame for losses - something Mr Castleton and the other claimants had always believed was the case. Internally, some Post Office staff had also grown concerned about what was happening. Speaking out for the very first time, one former manager told the BBC's File on 4 the Post Office had ""zero interest"" when he questioned why increasing numbers of postmasters were being blamed for losses totalling millions of pounds. Postmasters accused of fraud or theft are campaigning to have their convictions overturned The former staff member, who wishes to remain anonymous, said he voiced his concerns after reading internal documents. ""I didn't like what I was finding but was told it would be better for my career to 'move on and let it go',"" he said. He said he and a number of colleagues ""began to feel increasingly uncomfortable but there was no space for honesty, no desire for open dialogue"". ""The people running our stores were being arrested going to prison, losing their life savings, having massive mental health issues.  It felt as though doing the right thing no longer mattered, it was all about saving the image of the Post Office"". He said: ""A fellow member of staff asked one manager why they thought there was such a high volume of fraud. The manager laughed and said 'because half the post offices are run by ex-police who took early retirement or former pub landlords so they're probably used to fiddling the books'. ""I think it was meant as a joke but it betrays a subtle contempt for the people on the front line."" Ron Warmington, from the forensic accountants 'Second Sight', was brought in by the Post Office in 2012 to look at around 150 cases. In his first ever broadcast interview, he told File on 4 that as his findings became more critical of the Post Office, it became increasingly difficult for him to access the information he needed. ""It's the way that corporations behave when things go wrong,"" he said. ""And it was in that area that we found it so strange, the way the Post Office was reacting, presumably to protect the brand."" In 2015, the Post Office ended the investigation without notice but not before Mr Warmington had spoken to dozens of postmasters. ""I've spent decades dealing with some of the worst criminals in the world,"" he said. ""What struck me here was that I wasn't dealing with people like that. ""These were ordinary people that had simply found something that they couldn't deal with. They sought help but didn't get it and were put in a situation that frankly was life-changing for them."" The Post Office declined an interview but said it has ""accepted its past shortcomings"" and ""sincerely apologised"" to those affected. File on 4's 'Second Class Citizens: The Post Office IT Scandal' is on BBC Radio 4 on Tuesday 11 February at 20:00 GMT and available afterwards on BBC Sounds.

Meanwhile, Health Secretary Matt Hancock warned that the spread of the coronavirus would worsen before it improved.

Coronavirus officially named Covid-19, says WHO Can coronavirus be transmitted by door handles? And other questions Bosses 'removed' as virus death toll hits 1,000 Mr Walsh, from Hove, who works for a firm providing gas analysis equipment, caught the virus in Singapore and is thought to have infected 11 others at a French ski resort. Five of the cases linked to Mr Walsh are in England, five are in France and one is in Majorca, Spain. Two of the people who contracted coronavirus at the chalet where Steve Walsh stayed are Bob Saynor and his wife, Catriona Greenwood. She worked as a locum GP at the County Oak medical centre in Brighton, which was temporarily closed on Monday. Eight people have tested positive for the virus in the UK so far. One of those infected is an A&E worker at Worthing Hospital in West Sussex, the Department of Health said on Tuesday. All services at the hospital continue to operate as normal, a spokeswoman for the department said. Public Health England is contacting the very small number of patients who were seen by the A&E worker, who had followed advice to self-isolate. There have now beenmore than 40,000 cases of coronavirus worldwide, which has been declared a global health emergency. The death toll in China stands at 1,016. On Monday, the government issuednew powers in England,externalto keep people in quarantine to stop the virus spreading. Under the Department of Health measures people will not be free to leave quarantine, and can be forcibly sent into isolation if they pose a threat. Mr Hancock said these powers were ""proportionate"" and will ""help us slow down transmission of the virus"". The health secretary also announced that ""a capital facility"" was being launched immediately ""to support any urgent works the NHS needs for the coronavirus response, such as the creation of further isolation areas and other necessary facilities"". Speaking on a visit to Birmingham, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the public had ""every reason to be confident and calm"" about the threat of the virus, adding: ""We have got a fantastic NHS"".

"A proposed design for an HS2 train The government is set to approve the controversial High Speed 2 (HS2) rail project, the BBC has learned. An announcement on the route linking London to Birmingham, and then on to Manchester and Leeds, is expected by the prime minister on Tuesday. Supporters of the plan say it will improve transport times, create jobs and rebalance the UK's economy. But the rising cost of the project and accusations of mismanagement have provoked anger from critics. HS2 - which is due to be completed by 2040 - is already over budget and behind schedule. The government is expected to approve the whole line. However, it will try to make changes to the second phase of the project - the routes to Manchester and Leeds - to save money. Adam Marshall, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, told the BBC the train line would help cut overcrowding: ""We need a better backbone for our public transport services, ""The capacity HS2 is going to deliver is absolutely crucial."" Many smaller businesses have also welcomed the plan. Lee Kemp, who runs Vermillion Films in Birmingham, which makes corporate training films, said HS2 is ""really good news for us as a city and as a region"". ""With this actually moving forward people can start making plans around it,"" he told the BBC. Latest reaction to HS2 go-ahead How much? Six reasons why HS2 is so expensive What is the HS2 route and how much will it cost? Just how blow-out is the HS2 budget? HS2 costs out of control, says review's deputy chair However, the building of HS2 has also had its casualties. Ron and Anne Ryallhave been ordered to leave their home in March,because it is on the planned route and is due to be demolished. Ron told the BBC:,external""It's completely wrecked our lives. I'm finding it difficult that someone can just walk into your life and destroy it. My family has lived in this lane for 100 years. I was born here."" A source close to the project has confirmed that Boris Johnson will also announcea series of other transport projectson Tuesday. The projects are aimed at answering critics who fear the high cost of HS2 will mean other infrastructure projects are sidelined. Some of them will be situated in the north of England and the Midlands as part of the government's manifesto promise to ""level up"" the UK by investing more in regions outside of London. This video can not be played HS2: How much work has already been done? Approving the plan could be seen as a risky move for Mr Johnson as there has been opposition to the scheme within the Conservative Party. His chief adviser Dominic Cummings called HS2 a ""disaster zone"" last summer, while several MPs who represent constituencies that could be affected by the building works are also against the project. Transport SecretaryGrant Shapps has defended the right of Tory MPs to oppose the plan,saying they were entitled to represent the views of their constituents. Former Conservative cabinet minister David Lidington, said he feared HS2 was ""20th Century technology and infrastructure for a 21st Century economy"". Labour peer Lord Berkeley - former deputy chairman of the project's independent review - said HS2 would not help commuters in the north, but would be good for people travelling between London and Birmingham. Environmental groups say HS2 will boost carbon emissions and spoil areas of natural beauty. In 2015, it was estimated that the cost of HS2 would be Â£56bn, but a review has warned that it could rise to as much as Â£106bn. Work to prepare the ground for the first phase of HS2 linking London and Birmingham has been going on for years. But a green light from the government means construction of the railway will begin relatively soon. It is also expected that work on the line between Birmingham and Crewe will be rolled into the first phase. It had originally been slated to begin at a later stage. Construction on the second phase of the project, originally planned to link Crewe to Manchester and Birmingham with Leeds, is at a much earlier stage. The BBC has been told that the government will commission a further review of this part of the line to find ways of making it more affordable. It also wants to ensure that these lines can be better integrated into the existing railway network along with other planned upgrades such as Northern Powerhouse Rail, which aims to improve east-west links across the north of England. This video can not be played Working on HS2: ""The opportunities are just immense"" The initial plan was for a new railway line between London and the West Midlands carrying 400m-long (1,300ft) trains, with as many as 1,100 seats per train. The line would enable trains to reach speeds of up to 250mph and would run as often as 14 times an hour in each direction. This would be followed by a V-shaped second phase taking services from Birmingham to Manchester and Leeds. Early work has begun on the first phase of HS2 The Department for Transport (DfT) has saidthat the project will triple the capacity of trains across the entire route. According to the latest estimates, the first stage would be completed between 2028 and 2031 - long after the original opening date of 2026. Meanwhile, the second stage would be ready in 2035-2040. The announcement on High Speed 2 broadly mirrors some of the main recommendations from the government's still unpublished review into the project. I've read the full report and it emphasises that any significant changes to the first phase of HS2, linking London to Birmingham, would have caused further delays. No-one in government wanted that. The Crewe to Manchester and Birmingham to Leeds phase will undergo another review because it is at such an early stage, and ministers believe savings can be found. They also want the high-speed lines to be better integrated with our existing rail network and future infrastructure projects. Politics and pledges to voters in the north of England and the Midlands was a big part of this decision. But so too was the amount of work which has already been done on the first phase of the project. Ultimately, the government felt that turning back wasn't an option. Its much higher price tag has made HS2 politically toxic, so the government is also announcing a massive cash injection for buses and cycling in England. I'm told that figures within government who weren't sold on HS2 wanted those other transport pledges at the same time. Essentially, because they were over-optimistic in the first place. The National Audit Office has warned in successive reports over a number of years thatHS2 had an ""unrealistic timetable"". In its most recent analysis, it said thatthe risks of the project were never properly assessedwhen initial costs were estimated. HS2 began under the Labour government in 2009, but the cost has continued to balloon under subsequent administrations. Once it is built, journeys will be shorter. London-to-Birmingham travel times will be cut from one hour 21 minutes to 52 minutes, according to the DfT. And while it is being built, it is expected to create thousands of jobs and provide a stimulus to economic growth. Darren Caplan, head of the Railway Industry Association. told the BBC that the line would also ""increase capacity on the East Coast Main Line, the Midlands Main Line and the West Coast Main Line. There are benefits all round"". 'HS2 has completely wrecked our lives' What is HS2 and why scrap the Manchester link?

"A British man linked to 11 coronavirus cases has spoken for the first time, saying he has ""fully recovered"" from the illness. Steve Walsh, who remains quarantined in hospital, says his thoughts are with others who have contracted the virus. He said his family have been asked to isolate themselves ""as a precaution"". Meanwhile, Health Secretary Matt Hancock warned that the spread of the coronavirus would worsen before it improved. ""Dealing with this disease is a marathon, not a sprint,"" he told MPs in the Commons. ""We will do everything that is effective to tackle this virus and keep people safe."" Coronavirus officially named Covid-19, says WHO Can coronavirus be transmitted by door handles? And other questions Bosses 'removed' as virus death toll hits 1,000 Mr Walsh, from Hove, who works for a firm providing gas analysis equipment, caught the virus in Singapore and is thought to have infected 11 others at a French ski resort. Five of the cases linked to Mr Walsh are in England, five are in France and one is in Majorca, Spain. Two of the people who contracted coronavirus at the chalet where Steve Walsh stayed are Bob Saynor and his wife, Catriona Greenwood. She worked as a locum GP at the County Oak medical centre in Brighton, which was temporarily closed on Monday. Eight people have tested positive for the virus in the UK so far. One of those infected is an A&E worker at Worthing Hospital in West Sussex, the Department of Health said on Tuesday. All services at the hospital continue to operate as normal, a spokeswoman for the department said. Public Health England is contacting the very small number of patients who were seen by the A&E worker, who had followed advice to self-isolate. There have now beenmore than 40,000 cases of coronavirus worldwide, which has been declared a global health emergency. The death toll in China stands at 1,016. On Monday, the government issuednew powers in England,externalto keep people in quarantine to stop the virus spreading. Under the Department of Health measures people will not be free to leave quarantine, and can be forcibly sent into isolation if they pose a threat. Mr Hancock said these powers were ""proportionate"" and will ""help us slow down transmission of the virus"". The health secretary also announced that ""a capital facility"" was being launched immediately ""to support any urgent works the NHS needs for the coronavirus response, such as the creation of further isolation areas and other necessary facilities"". Speaking on a visit to Birmingham, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the public had ""every reason to be confident and calm"" about the threat of the virus, adding: ""We have got a fantastic NHS"". Coronavirus labs to begin testing in Scotland How worried should we be? Your questions answered Coronavirus: 'I walk around my block to stay sane' Meanwhile, the government has asked medical suppliers to carry out a risk assessment on the impact of coronavirus and travel restrictions introduced by the Chinese government. Companies have also been asked to retain existing stockpiles of medical supplies, which had been compiled as a contingency measure ahead of Breixt, the Department of Health said. The department said there were no current medicine shortages in the UK linked to the outbreak and the measures were precautionary. Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, described the economic impact of the virus in the UK as ""containable"". In other developments: As of Tuesday afternoon, a total of 1,358 people have been tested for coronavirus, of which eight were confirmed positive Among those quarantined on the Wirral is nine-year-old Jasmine Siddle from Northumberland, who had to spend her birthday in hospital Patcham Nursing Home in Brighton confirmed on Tuesday that it has ""closed to all visitors"" as a precaution after one of the infected GPs visited a patient there Another branch of the County Oak medical centre in Brighton - located less than two miles away in Deneway - was also closed on Tuesday, along with the Haven Practice in Brighton All three surgeries are expected to reopen on Wednesday after deep cleaning The World Health Organization said it nowhas a name for the new coronavirus- Covid-19 County Oak medical centre in Brighton was closed for cleaning on Monday Mr Walsh contracted the coronavirus at a work conference in Singapore, before travelling to a French ski resort for a holiday on his way back to the UK. In a statement from quarantine in Guy's Hospital in London, Mr Walsh, a cub scout leader, thanked the NHS for their care. He said he contacted his GP, NHS 111 and Public Health England, on learning he had been exposed to a confirmed case of coronavirus. He added: ""I was advised to attend an isolated room at hospital, despite showing no symptoms, and subsequently self-isolated at home as instructed. ""When the diagnosis was confirmed I was sent to an isolation unit in hospital, where I remain, and, as a precaution, my family was also asked to isolate themselves."" He thanked friends, family and colleagues for their support, adding: ""I ask the media to respect our privacy."" The main signs of infection are fever (high temperature) and a cough as well as shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. Frequent hand washing with soap or gel, avoiding close contact with people who are ill and not touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands, can help cut the risk of infection. Catching coughs and sneezes in a tissue, binning it and washing your hands can minimise the risk of spreading disease. Anyone experiencing symptoms, even if mild, after travelling from mainland China, Thailand, Japan, Republic of Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia or Macau, is advised to stay indoors and call the NHS 111 phone service.

"This video can not be played Tonique Kerr's husband Reshawn Davis was told he would not be on the flight on Monday night A Home Office flight deporting convicted offenders to Jamaica has left the UK, despite a last-minute legal challenge. Downing Street said 17 people were deported, but 25 others had been stopped because of the court order. The court ruling cameon Monday night after concerns that some detainees may not have had access to legal advice. One woman, whose husband was taken off the flight, said there was confusion over what would happen next. All of those being deported are Jamaican nationals who have been convicted of criminal offences and given prison sentences of 12 months or more. In a statement, the prime minister's spokesman said ""we bitterly regret"" the court decision that stopped the 25 people from leaving, and will urgently appeal. ""The offences which these people were responsible for include one manslaughter, one firearms offence, seven violent offences, two which are in the category of rape or sexual offences and 14 drugs offences,"" the spokesman said. He added: ""We make no apology whatsoever for seeking to remove serious foreign national offenders."" Campaigners 'delighted' by Jamaica flight court ruling On Monday,a Court of Appeal judge ruledthe government should not deport detainees from Colnbrooke and Harmondsworth detention centres, near Heathrow, after lawyers argued mobile phone signal problems meant some of the detainees could not get legal advice. The ruling said the government must not deport anyone from those centres unless they had access to a functioning, non-O2 Sim card on or before 3 February. There had been calls for the government to suspend the flight until a report on the Windrush scandal has been published. A leaked draft of the report said the government should consider ending the deportation of foreign-born offenders who came to the UK as children. Campaigners argued that most of the detainees due to be deported had spent the majority of their lives in Britain. Campaigners protested against the flight outside Downing Street on Monday Bella Sankey, director of charity Detention Action, told the BBC News Channel: ""In these cases where people have been here for a long time and are to all intents and purposes British, by deporting individuals like that you are doubly punishing them. ""For many of these individuals deportation is a much harsher sentence than the time they've already served. Imagine being forever banished from the country you grew up in, unable to visit all of your close family and friends."" Immigration lawyer Jacqueline Mckenzie told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme: ""There needs to be a moral debate about this because it cannot be right that we are picking up people in their 30s who arrived at two... and sending them to countries that they don't know, leaving behind all their family."" Call to review foreign-born offender deportations Windrush row over criminal deportation flight Government under pressure over Jamaica flight Tottenham MP David Lammy said it was an ""outrage"" that the flight had departed. ""The government wants to give the impression that everyone who was deported was a hardened violent criminal, but the reality is many of those who were scheduled to be deported had committed non-violent, one-time drugs offences. ""The lessons from Windrush have not been learned. Lives are being ruined because we don't remember our history."" Tonique Kerr said her husband, Reshawn Davis, who has been in the UK for 20 years, was among those told on Monday that he would not be on the flight. ""We don't know what's happening,"" she told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme. Ms Kerr said her husband had been sentenced to 14 months in prison - although only served two months - under the controversial joint enterprise law, after two mobile phones were stolen and he was ""just there when it happened"". ""He came [to the UK] when he was 11,"" she said. ""He's not actually been back since he's come to this country. He's now 30, he's spent most of his life here."" Shabana Mahmood MP said one of her constituents had also been taken off the flight. ""He actually served in the British Armed Forces,"" she said. ""He did two tours of Afghanistan, when he came back he suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder. ""He was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and that sort of began the deterioration of his mental health, after which he was convicted for GBH. ""His mental health has continued to deteriorate and his argument has always been: he's served this country, he hasn't had help for the PTSD he picked up as a serving soldier for our country. ""So it really goes to the heart of our notions of what it is to be a citizen."" The flight had been due to leave for Kingston at 6:30 GMT on Tuesday. Home Secretary Priti Patel said those on the flight included serious offenders Chancellor Sajid Javid said no-one protected by the court ruling was on the flight. ""It is absolutely right that when they have served their sentence that we send them out of the country,"" Mr Javid told BBC Radio 5 Live on Tuesday morning. ""They are not British nationals, they are not members of the Windrush generation, they are all foreign national offenders."" On Tuesday, the Home Office said: ""Today 17 serious foreign criminals were deported from the UK. They were convicted of rape, violent crimes and drug offences and had a combined sentence length of 75 years, as well as a life sentence. ""We make no apology whatsoever for seeking to remove dangerous foreign criminals. ""We will be urgently pursuing the removal of those who were prevented from boarding the flight due to a legal challenge over a mobile network failure."" And the PM's spokesman said: ""The legal process for removing these offenders - which has included repeated appeals and judicial reviews - has already cost the British public tens of thousands of pounds. ""The taxpayer will now be left with an even bigger bill and the prospect of convicts who are considered to pose a threat to the UK being granted bail while this matter is resolved."" The Home Office complied with the court order One of those who had been due to be deported on Tuesday is father-of-five Howard Ormsby. He was jailed for 18 months after he was convicted of possession with intent to supply class A drugs and he was released in December. ""I came here at the age of 15 with my older sister and I've been here 18 years of my life,"" the 32-year-old said, speaking to the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire show from a detention centre at Harmondsworth, west London. ""I've never tried to deny the fact I've made a mistake, but everyone has a chance to right their wrongs. ""I have all my family here - I have no-one in Jamaica.""

"There's been growing criticism of how authorities are handling the outbreak China has ""removed"" several senior officials over their handling of the coronavirus outbreak - as the death toll passed 1,000. The party secretary for the Hubei Health Commission, and the head of the commission, are the most senior officials to be demoted so far. The deputy director of the local Red Cross was also removed for ""dereliction of duty"" over ""handling of donations"". Meanwhile the World Health Organization has named the virus Covid-19. The WHO is holding a two-day meeting in Geneva involving top medical, scientific and public health experts, aimed at speeding up the global response to the outbreak. China launches coronavirus 'close contact' app Coronavirus prankster faces jail for metro stunt Coronavirus: 'I walk around my block of flats to stay sane' There are now more than 42,200 confirmed cases across China.The number of deaths has overtaken that of the Sars epidemic in 2003. On Monday, some 103 died in Hubei province alone, a daily record, and the national death toll is now 1,016. But the number of new infections nationally was down almost 20% from the day before, from 3,062 to 2,478. Speaking to Reuters news agency,leading Chinese respiratory expert Zhong Nanshan said the virus was hitting a peak in China this month,externaland that the outbreak may be over by April. He said he was basing the forecast on mathematical modelling, recent events and government action. However, Zhong's previous forecast of an earlier peak turned out to be premature. According to state media, there have been hundreds of sackings, investigations and warnings across Hubei and other provinces during the outbreak. But removal from a certain role - while regarded as a censure - does not always mean the person will be sacked entirely, as it can also mean demotion. As well as being removed from their posts, officials can also be punished by the ruling Communist Party. For example, the deputy head of the government-run Red Cross charity, Zhang Qin, was given ""a serious intra-Party warning as well as a serious administrative demerit"", state media said. The two Hubei party officials will be replaced by a national figure - the deputy director of China's National Health Commission, Wang Hesheng. Earlier this month, the deputy head of the Wuhan bureau of statistics was removed, with similar sanctions for ""violating relevant regulations to distribute face masks"". Coronavirus super-spreaders: Why are they important? How worried should we be? British coronavirus patient recovers from illness Coronavirus: Nissan to shut factory in Japan In recent days, Chinese authorities have increasingly been criticised for their handling of the crisis. The death of a doctor whose early warnings were suppressed by authoritiessparked widespread public anger. Beijing has sent a team from its highest anti-corruption agency to Hubei to investigate the treatment of Dr Li by police. But sources say at least 500 hospital staff had been infected,externalin Wuhan by mid-January, according to the South China Morning Post. Doctors and nurses had been told not to make the extent of infections public, it reports. Analysis by BBC China correspondent, Stephen McDonell, Beijing Somebody was always going to be for the chop following the shambolic early handling of the coronavirus emergency. That early response cost precious weeks, slowing the response while millions of people left Wuhan before the transport blockade was in place. It was only a question of who would go - and when. With the local authorities facing a storm of public anger, the top two officials in Hubei's provincial health commission have been dismissed. Nobody expects it to end there. Possibly sensing that his own head was already on the block, the mayor of Wuhan, Zhou Xianwang, said the reason it took so long to warn the public about the virus was that he didn't have clearance from above. Clearance from above? That could mean permission from the provincial party secretary. It could also be interpreted that he was directing the blame all the way to Beijing. Now that can mean either China's top leaders are partly at fault; or the Communist Party's governance structures need to be overhauled; or the mayor is wrong - that is, he is the one who ultimately should carry the blame. People can decide which of these options is most likely to be acknowledged and acted upon. More than three-quarters of the deaths have been in Hubei's provincial capital, Wuhan, the centre of the outbreak. The city of 11 million has been in lockdown for weeks. China has been sending large numbers of medical staff to the city.State news agency Xinhua shared images on Monday of doctors and nurses shaving their heads,externalto prepare for wearing protective clothing. However, health officials have warned that medical facilities in rural areas across the country are inadequate. In Hong Kong, 23 households were evacuated from an estate on Monday night and taken into quarantine, after cases were detected there. The territory has had months of protests and chief executive Carrie Lam has called for ""social cohesion"" in the face of the health crisis. Two Japanese citizens who were evacuated on government-chartered flights from Wuhan in January have now tested positive. Both men had previously tested negative for the virus but later displayed symptoms, according to media reports.

"This video can not be played Ireland's elections: Five myths explained Fianna FÃ¡il has won the most seats in the Irish general election just one ahead of Sinn FÃ©in, who recorded a historic result. Sinn FÃ©in's haul of 37 seats is an increase of 14 on the 2016 election. Fine Gael, whose party leader Leo Varadkar led the outgoing government as taoiseach (Irish prime minister), finished with 35 seats, down 15 from four years ago. The tight numbers could lead to lengthy negotiations to form a government. The election results were confirmed shortly after midnight when two Fianna FÃ¡il candidates, Brendan Smith and Niamh Smyth, won the last two seats in Cavan-Monaghan. The final results showed that: Sinn FÃ©in had won 37 seats, an increase of 14 on the 2016 election Fianna FÃ¡il had lost six seats since 2016 but became the largest party by one seat Fine Gael lost 15 seats from 2016 The Green Party recorded their best ever election result, winning 12 seats - an improvement of 10 from 2016 The outcome was described as""something of a revolution in the ballot box""by Sinn FÃ©in leader Mary Lou McDonald. With all first preferences counted, the left-wing republican party has taken 24.5% of the vote, compared to 22% for Fianna FÃ¡il and 21% for Fine Gael. Before the election, both Fine Gael and Fianna FÃ¡il had ruled out forging a coalition with left-wing republican party Sinn FÃ©in, citing its tax policies and IRA past as deterrents. On Sunday, taoiseach (Irish PM) and Fine Gael leader Leo Varadkar conceded it would be ""challenging"" to form a government. Fianna FÃ¡il leader MicheÃ¡l Martin did not rule out working with Sinn FÃ©in, but said ""significant incompatibilities"" still existed. Sinn FÃ©in President Mary Lou McDonald, who topped the poll in her four-seat Dublin Central constituency, said Sinn FÃ©in wanted to be in government and was working to establish if the numbers were there to deliver it without Fianna FÃ¡il or Fine Gael. On Monday evening, she said she had not heard from the leaders of those two parties and has instead been speaking to Labour, the Green Party and other smaller parties that make up the DÃ¡il (Irish parliament). ""People want different politics, new politics and better government - a new government - and I believe Sinn FÃ©in will be the core of that,"" she told reporters in Dublin. ""I may well be the next taoiseach,"" she added. As it happened: Irish election results and analysis day two Who is Mary Lou McDonald? Profile of Ireland's political parties Speaking to BBC Newsnight, Mrs McDonald also said she believed constitutional change was coming. ""The point has been conceded in the Good Friday agreement by the British state - the presence here is solely on the basis of consent,"" she said. ""That consent can only be tested in a unity referendum and we are going to have a unity referendum - and I want us to do it in an orderly, thoughtful democratic and absolutely peaceful manner."" Sinn FÃ©in's vice-president, Michelle O'Neill, said the party would have ""asks in terms of the republican project"", in line with itsrepeated calls for the next government to prepare for Irish unity. Left-leaning Sinn FÃ©in managed to successfully tap into the public anger felt in the Republic of Ireland over issues that have dogged centre-right Fine Gael for a number of years - a shortage of housing, rocketing rents and homelessness, analysts suggest. That is despite the fact the country is forecast to have one of the fastest growing economies in the EU in 2020. They were dubbed ""the problems of success"" by former Finance Minister Michael Noonan as far back as 2015. This video can not be played ""This is a seismic election shift"" - Michelle O'Neill Brexit - a considerable focus of Leo Varadkar and his deputy Simon Coveney while in power - barely registered as an issue in the campaign. Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Arlene Foster, whose party is in a power-sharing government with Sinn FÃ©in in Northern Ireland, said younger voters had backed Sinn FÃ©in as a ""protest vote"". ""From a Northern Ireland perspective we will have to work with whoever the government is in the Republic of Ireland,"" Mrs Foster told BBC News NI. She also said Sinn FÃ©in may have their focus on Northern Ireland questioned, in the way there had been a ""wailing and gnashing of teeth"" over her party's confidence-and-supply agreement with the previous Conservative government in the UK. Sinn FÃ©in's best-ever result is the success story of this election. However, with how the overall votes have fallen, we know that Sinn FÃ©in will not necessarily end up in government despite its swathe of victories. The magic number for winning a majority government in the Republic of Ireland is 80 seats. None of the three big parties - Fine Gael, Fianna FÃ¡il and now Sinn FÃ©in - will come close to that figure. Attempts to form a new coalition-of-sorts will formally get under way, although this will be complex. Previous administrations in the Republic of Ireland have been forged this way too, but it's taken a while to get there. In 2016, it took70 days for a government to be formedafter the parties agreed a confidence-and-supply agreement, which saw a Fine Gael-only cabinet, propped up by Fianna FÃ¡il votes on key policy areas. Read more of Jayne's analysis here. Sinn FÃ©in's vote has increased dramatically - winning 37 seats out of the 42 seats it stood candidates in and topping the poll in 30 constituencies. Followingthe last election in 2016 Sinn FÃ©in had 23 seatsin the DÃ¡il. Fine Gael has been in government since 2011, firstly with the Labour Party and then with independents and since 2016, a confidence-and-supply deal with Fianna FÃ¡il. It looks set to lose seats for the second election in a row, but that does not necessarily rule it out of forming another government. Its share of first preference votes dropped from 25.5% at the last election to 20.9%. The taoiseach said he was ""not really"" disappointed that he did not top the poll in his own constituency. He did get an increase in his votes compared to the last election. He added it was clear there was now a ""three-party system"". On Sunday MicheÃ¡l Martin said reports suggested his party ""would be the largest"" but that it was early days and that he respected the will of the people. The Green Party has increased the number of seats it holds, jumping from two seats in the last election to 10. Green leader Eamon Ryan, who was elected for Dublin Bay South, said his party would play its part in talks to form a government.

"The government approves the controversial HS2 rail project The PM criticised the HS2 company's management but said that did not detract from the value of the scheme Boris Johnson will appoint a full-time minister to oversee the project The route, to be completed by 2040, will link London to Birmingham, and then Manchester and Leeds Supporters say it will improve travel, create jobs and rebalance the UK's economy Critics point to the project already being over budget, behind schedule and damaging to the environment Simon Read, Marie Jackson and Lauren Turner The Â£106bn project will have an ""overall negative impact on Wales' economy,"" a transport expert says. That's it from Business Live for today. But we'll be back bright and early from 06:00 tomorrow morning with our usual mix of the latest breaking news and analysis from the business world. Do join us then. A proposed design for an HS2 train Here's a quick recap of today's developments.  Conservative former Cabinet minister Lord Young of Cookham was transport secretary in 1996 when HS1 - the fast link between London and the Channel Tunnel - was given the go-ahead. Speaking in the House of Lords today, he recalled: ""That was opposed by local MPs, it was challenged through the courts, people said it was too expensive, it was challenged on environmental grounds, people said we should spend the money on local lines instead. ""Today, I don't think there's a single member of this House who would argue that HS1 was not the right decision to take. ""Will it not be the same in 25 years' time about HS2?"" Transport Minister Baroness Vere of Norbiton added: ""HS1 was a great boon and I believe HS2 will be too."" Ros Jones, Mayor of Doncaster, says she is ""both pleased and concerned"" by today's news. The government has said there will be a review of cost-cutting measures relating to Phase 2B of the plan, which runs from Birmingham, through South Yorkshire and on to Leeds. The mayor says she would like more clarity on this review for affected residents. ""We have always supported the principle of HS2 but it is clear the current Phase 2B route is the wrong solution for South Yorkshire,"" said the mayor. ""It will have a devastating impact on our communities, tear up our landscape, limit our economic potential and cap the future growth of our rail services in our region."" She adds that having a further review into phase two means further uncertainty for affected residents, who do not know if and when their properties will be demolished. While Doncaster Council supports HS2, it is against the current planned route and has called for a South Yorkshire station to be built at Meadowhall.  Friends of the Earth tweets...

Quinn, Balfour Beatty Group boss, is excited about HS2. âHS2 is a
bold regeneration scheme that is ready for implementation and provides a true
legacy for the generations to come,"" he said. ""We must invest in their future: drive new
skills and capabilities, turbo charge small businesses across the country and
show that the UK is determined to meet its carbon reduction targets.â Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham says while he ""warmly"" welcomes the announcement, ""there was a lot of detail lacking"". He says he wanted more information on the timetable for work in the north, for example, and the line of the route. Mr Burnham adds:  We still hear the government prefers an upgrade for Northern Powerhouse rail rather than a new line. We believe this line has got to go from Liverpool through Manchester to Bradford, which would be the new line we need. So he was, I'm afraid, unspecific on all of those things. But as an overall headline, we welcome what he said.  Political leaders in West and South Yorkshire have welcomedthe prime minister's announcement that the HS2 high-speed rail link will go ahead. Dan Jarvis, Mayor of Sheffield City Region, said HS2 was ""crucial to level up the economy and provide vital upgrades to our creaking Victorian infrastructure"". However, he added: ""We need urgent investment in South Yorkshireâs wider transport infrastructure so we see improvements in the short term."" Meanwhile, Bradford Council leader Susan Hinchcliffe said while she welcomed today's announcement, the ""really key decision"" for the district's future was the government's stance on Northern Powerhouse Rail - the proposed east-west rail connection. ""We have made a strong economic case for Bradford to be a stop on a new line between Manchester and Leeds. Stopping at Bradford would add Â£15bn to the economy of the North,"" she said. Birmingham's Grade I-listed Curzon Street Station will be incorporated into plans there for a new HS2 stop. The regenerated facility, planned for a swathe of land in central Birmingham, will be the first brand new intercity terminus station built in Britain since the 19th Century, says the company behind the HS2 project. The existing historic building will be linked to the new station's eastern concourse at New Canal Street. Here's a bit of history: Leeds City Centre (artist's impression) ""HS2 is more than a railway, it has already unlocked training and
job opportunities for thousands of our citizens and is a catalyst for millions
of pounds of investment into our cities,"" says Judith Blake, chair of Core
Cities UK and leader of Leeds City Council. ""It is already attracting blue chip
companies into Birmingham and will make a major contribution to the
largest regeneration project in Europe which will see the doubling in size
of Leeds City Centre,"" she points out. ""HS2 is itself the largest engineering project in Western Europe
and should be seen as a statement of this country's bold post-Brexit ambition. ""Future delay and uncertainty
is not an option."" Alex MossBBC Yorkshire The BBC has been out and about at Leeds Railway Station talking to commuters there about HS2. There was a general air of indifference to the project - but a desire to see local rail services improved. Keith Smith, 81, said: âItâs costing an awful lot of money. Obviously improving journey times is a good thing but I'm not sure the benefits are worth the amount that is being spent. ""I would have thought they'd be better investing in the local infrastructure."" Meanwhile, Darren Wilson 49, from Hull, said: âBy the time itâs built here I probably wonât be alive.â He added: âThey need to make improvements to trains locally, rather than the ones going to London.â BBC Yorkshire's political editor tweets...

Greenpeace UK executive director John Sauven says introducing HS2 would mean the PM had ""the dubious honour of being this century's largest destroyer of ancient woodlands in the UK"". He adds: We're totally in favour of a transport revolution that cuts pollution and carbon emissions, but bulldozing through irreplaceable wildlife and nature sites is not the way to go about it.  Over 100 ancient woodlands will be damaged or destroyed along with 33 sites of special scientific interests and hundreds of local wildlife sites. Giving the go-ahead to such a costly and damaging project is a missed opportunity. The prime minister should have created a first-class regional rail and bus service, up and running across the north in years rather than decades and without adding to the climate and nature emergency.  Steve Rotheram, Metro Mayor for the Liverpool City Region, says the decision announced today is welcome ""but falls short of the full and unequivocal commitment to both HS2 and Northern Powerhouse Rail that the north needs"". He adds: I will continue to push â alongside my fellow Northern leaders â for delivery of the new west-east rail line, fully integrated with HS2, that our city region needs.  Improving rail connectivity is vitally important but, for the vast majority of people, transport is not about big national schemes, they want a local transport system they can rely on every day. Thatâs why later this month I will be announcing my plans to improve our local bus services, as part of my wider ambition to build a London-style transport system for our area.

""The certainty provided by government will give the sector confidence to invest in much-needed innovation, put in place longer-term financing and take a strategic view of the future.â Richard Scott, partner at Accuracy, added: âHS2 is enormously important to UK contractors and subcontractors, as it is one of just a few major infrastructure projects that the sector is relying on, along with Heathrow expansion and new nuclear. âGiving the line the green light also signals the end to the likelihood of government being caught in years of wrangling over early termination of contracts, and reinstating land on which work has already begun.â While lots of Business Live readers seem unhappy with today's HS2 news, here are some positive views. Alan Lewis says: ""This is a great - and much needed - development for public
transport in our country. It will add considerably capacity to the completely
full rail lines between Birmingham and London. It will take fast inter-city
trains off our old Victorian rail lines and allow room for extra commuter, regional
and freight trains. This should be welcomed by all travellers, businesses and
environmentalists as it will provide additional low carbon transport, which is
much better than building more roads."" Meanwhile John Griffiths says: ""I live in rural Buckinghamshire, about four miles from the
proposed route. It wonât benefit me directly at all but to oppose it is
short-sighted."" Why? ""We will all benefit from the building of this railway,
which will bring much-needed investment and jobs to the economy at a time when
Brexit risks taking it all out,"" he says. ""To delay or cancel is only to put off a bigger cost in
the future. It was always going to have to be built one day, but to do it now
is the right thing to do."" Labour MP Stephen Kinnock has accused the government of showing ""contempt"" to the people of Wales. He says the entire budget for electrifying the railway line to Swansea would be 1% of the HS2 budget. ""Will he commit to electrification or will he continue to hold the people of Wales in contempt?"" he asks. ""North Wales will benefit from the line to Crewe,"" Boris Johnson told him in response. He added that the government has ""already electrified the line to Cardiff"". The RSPB tweets... Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Post-Brexit transition border checks could cause fresh food supply problems, an industry body has warned. Shoppers will notice the supply issues next January unless there is a ""massive upgrade"" in border facilities, the British Retail Consortium said. The warning came after cabinet minister Michael Gove said that border checks are ""inevitable"" after the Brexit transition period ends on 31 December. Officials said firms have enough time to prepare for the changes. Border checks could quickly cause hold-ups at Channel ports of thousands of trucks, including those carrying fresh food, the BRC said. The government will have to ""move fast"" to put in place the necessary border infrastructure and staff to cope with those checks by the end of the year, it said. If it doesn't, ""consumers in the UK will see significant disruption, particularly in the availability of fresh fruit and vegetables"" the BRC's director of food and sustainability Andrew Opie warned. ""If you think this is going to hit us in January, that's our peak import season for things like fresh fruit and vegetables. Customers are really going to see the problems on supermarket shelves unless we get that infrastructure,"" he said. ""So, you've got enormous bureaucracy, enormous change, but crucially you've got a problem with the infrastructure at the key ports around the Channel, which currently really act as an extension of the motorway for our supply chain, where you will be holding thousands of vehicles every day."" ""I don't know if you've been to Dover recently, but there isn't an enormous amount of room to hold that infrastructure,"" he added. The warning came after Mr Gove told a Border Delivery Group event on Monday: ""The UK will be outside the single market and outside the customs union, so we will have to be ready for the customs procedures and regulatory checks that will inevitably follow."" Brexit: Jargon-busting guide to the key terms Brexit: What trade deals has the UK done so far? Brexit trade: What do the UK and EU want? The Brexit transition period is due to end at 11pm on 31 December this year. From then, there will be import checks at the UK border, and traders in the EU and UK will have extra paperwork,the government said,external. From next January, all traders will have to fill out customs declarations and be liable to customs checks on goods for cross-channel trade. If no trade deal is reached with the EU, taxes such as tariffs will also need to be charged and collected. Michael Gove said businesses must be ready for 'customs procedures and regulatory checks' Facilities such as the Channel Tunnel have been designed for minimal border checks. New customs infrastructure, facilities and systems as well as staff, agents and vets will have to be in place by the end of this year. But Mr Gove told the conference there would be light touch administration of trade across the Irish Sea. However, last week it emerged that Stena Line, the biggest operator of ferries in the Irish Sea, is preparing for trade checks between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. It was quietly confirmed in a speech. Some might argue it has been inevitable since the election. But the change in the way the UK trade border functions with our biggest trade partner is one of the single biggest changes to the way the UK economy functions. Put simply, many industries rely on the frictionless free flow of goods between the UK and the continent. The unequivocal message from Michael Gove is that businesses should prepare for the the end of that as 2020 draws to a close. Whereas the impact of all this in the Irish Sea has garnered considerable attention, the new trading arrangements between Dover and Calais and along the Channel Tunnel will have a bigger effect on the economy. By getting businesses to take the prospect seriously, the government's hope is that more will be prepared and so delays and disruption can be limited. But we are dealing with parts of the border that are designed to run without checks. There will need to be more customs officers, thousands more customs agents, mass recruitment of vets, and new customs posts. Almost every independent economic analysis - and the government's own until now - has shown that extra trade friction with what is currently our biggest market will be an overall hit to the economy. Preparation can help alleviate some of that hit, but not all. Businesses also said they face extra costs from checks. The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) said that for many businesses, border delays would incur higher costs than tariffs. Adam Marshall, the BCC director general, said: ""Additional friction will equal higher costs for a lot of our business, and while the discussion over the past few months has focussed a lot on tariffs, it's actually these border costs... that really is the biggest source of cost for most."" EU trade will not be waved through with zero checks, which would have been the case under a no-deal Brexit. Traders will not be able to use special arrangements to lodge new paperwork after a grace period at a later date. Industries from car manufacturers to food distributors, which rely on the frictionless free flow of goods with the continent, say they face extra costs, delays and red tape from what are known as non-tariff barriers. Products of animal origin will need export certificates from a registered vet.

"This video can not be played Tonique Kerr's husband Reshawn Davis was told he would not be on the flight on Monday night A Home Office flight deporting convicted offenders to Jamaica has left the UK, despite a last-minute legal challenge. Downing Street said 17 people were deported, but 25 others had been stopped because of the court order. The court ruling cameon Monday night after concerns that some detainees may not have had access to legal advice. One woman, whose husband was taken off the flight, said there was confusion over what would happen next. All of those being deported are Jamaican nationals who have been convicted of criminal offences and given prison sentences of 12 months or more. In a statement, the prime minister's spokesman said ""we bitterly regret"" the court decision that stopped the 25 people from leaving, and will urgently appeal. ""The offences which these people were responsible for include one manslaughter, one firearms offence, seven violent offences, two which are in the category of rape or sexual offences and 14 drugs offences,"" the spokesman said. He added: ""We make no apology whatsoever for seeking to remove serious foreign national offenders."" Campaigners 'delighted' by Jamaica flight court ruling On Monday,a Court of Appeal judge ruledthe government should not deport detainees from Colnbrooke and Harmondsworth detention centres, near Heathrow, after lawyers argued mobile phone signal problems meant some of the detainees could not get legal advice. The ruling said the government must not deport anyone from those centres unless they had access to a functioning, non-O2 Sim card on or before 3 February. There had been calls for the government to suspend the flight until a report on the Windrush scandal has been published. A leaked draft of the report said the government should consider ending the deportation of foreign-born offenders who came to the UK as children. Campaigners argued that most of the detainees due to be deported had spent the majority of their lives in Britain. Campaigners protested against the flight outside Downing Street on Monday Bella Sankey, director of charity Detention Action, told the BBC News Channel: ""In these cases where people have been here for a long time and are to all intents and purposes British, by deporting individuals like that you are doubly punishing them. ""For many of these individuals deportation is a much harsher sentence than the time they've already served. Imagine being forever banished from the country you grew up in, unable to visit all of your close family and friends."" Immigration lawyer Jacqueline Mckenzie told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme: ""There needs to be a moral debate about this because it cannot be right that we are picking up people in their 30s who arrived at two... and sending them to countries that they don't know, leaving behind all their family."" Call to review foreign-born offender deportations Windrush row over criminal deportation flight Government under pressure over Jamaica flight Tottenham MP David Lammy said it was an ""outrage"" that the flight had departed. ""The government wants to give the impression that everyone who was deported was a hardened violent criminal, but the reality is many of those who were scheduled to be deported had committed non-violent, one-time drugs offences. ""The lessons from Windrush have not been learned. Lives are being ruined because we don't remember our history."" Tonique Kerr said her husband, Reshawn Davis, who has been in the UK for 20 years, was among those told on Monday that he would not be on the flight. ""We don't know what's happening,"" she told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme. Ms Kerr said her husband had been sentenced to 14 months in prison - although only served two months - under the controversial joint enterprise law, after two mobile phones were stolen and he was ""just there when it happened"". ""He came [to the UK] when he was 11,"" she said. ""He's not actually been back since he's come to this country. He's now 30, he's spent most of his life here."" Shabana Mahmood MP said one of her constituents had also been taken off the flight. ""He actually served in the British Armed Forces,"" she said. ""He did two tours of Afghanistan, when he came back he suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder. ""He was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and that sort of began the deterioration of his mental health, after which he was convicted for GBH. ""His mental health has continued to deteriorate and his argument has always been: he's served this country, he hasn't had help for the PTSD he picked up as a serving soldier for our country. ""So it really goes to the heart of our notions of what it is to be a citizen."" The flight had been due to leave for Kingston at 6:30 GMT on Tuesday. Home Secretary Priti Patel said those on the flight included serious offenders Chancellor Sajid Javid said no-one protected by the court ruling was on the flight. ""It is absolutely right that when they have served their sentence that we send them out of the country,"" Mr Javid told BBC Radio 5 Live on Tuesday morning. ""They are not British nationals, they are not members of the Windrush generation, they are all foreign national offenders."" On Tuesday, the Home Office said: ""Today 17 serious foreign criminals were deported from the UK. They were convicted of rape, violent crimes and drug offences and had a combined sentence length of 75 years, as well as a life sentence. ""We make no apology whatsoever for seeking to remove dangerous foreign criminals. ""We will be urgently pursuing the removal of those who were prevented from boarding the flight due to a legal challenge over a mobile network failure."" And the PM's spokesman said: ""The legal process for removing these offenders - which has included repeated appeals and judicial reviews - has already cost the British public tens of thousands of pounds. ""The taxpayer will now be left with an even bigger bill and the prospect of convicts who are considered to pose a threat to the UK being granted bail while this matter is resolved."" The Home Office complied with the court order One of those who had been due to be deported on Tuesday is father-of-five Howard Ormsby. He was jailed for 18 months after he was convicted of possession with intent to supply class A drugs and he was released in December. ""I came here at the age of 15 with my older sister and I've been here 18 years of my life,"" the 32-year-old said, speaking to the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire show from a detention centre at Harmondsworth, west London. ""I've never tried to deny the fact I've made a mistake, but everyone has a chance to right their wrongs. ""I have all my family here - I have no-one in Jamaica.""

"The Post Office pursued Lee Castleton for losses A postmaster says the Post Office spent Â£320,000 suing him over Â£25,000 he was falsely accused of stealing. Lee Castleton, from Bridlington,  East Yorkshire, was made bankrupt after he lost a two-year legal battle with the Post Office. A recent ruling found problems with the Post Office's accountancy software could instead be to blame for the losses. The Post Office has apologised and accepts its ""past shortcomings"". For two decades, the Post Office pursued hundreds of its workers over accounting discrepancies with its Horizon IT system, accusing people of theft, fraud or false accounting. Many were fired, made bankrupt or even sent to prison. Mr Castleton described how he and his family were abused, including an incident where his daughter was spat at, because ""local people presumed I was a thief"". The former stockbroker, who bought a seafront Post Office branch in 2003, said he began to notice thousands of pounds in losses from his accounts within months of taking over the business. Despite calling the Post Office's helpline nearly every day for three months, he said: ""We just couldn't understand where the losses were coming from."" Following an audit, Mr Castleton's branch was found to have a Â£25,000 shortfall. He was subsequently suspended. The Post Office spent the next two years pursuing him for the missing money through the civil courts. ""The Post Office decided to make an example of me,"" said Mr Castleton. He was forced to defend himself in London's High Court because he had no money to hire a lawyer. When he lost the case, he was made bankrupt. Mr Castleton is now one of more than 550 former postmasters who will get a share of a Â£58m settlement from the Post Office. The agreement was reached in December last year, when the High Court ruled that technical problems with the Post Office's Horizon IT system could instead be to blame for losses - something Mr Castleton and the other claimants had always believed was the case. Internally, some Post Office staff had also grown concerned about what was happening. Speaking out for the very first time, one former manager told the BBC's File on 4 the Post Office had ""zero interest"" when he questioned why increasing numbers of postmasters were being blamed for losses totalling millions of pounds. Postmasters accused of fraud or theft are campaigning to have their convictions overturned The former staff member, who wishes to remain anonymous, said he voiced his concerns after reading internal documents. ""I didn't like what I was finding but was told it would be better for my career to 'move on and let it go',"" he said. He said he and a number of colleagues ""began to feel increasingly uncomfortable but there was no space for honesty, no desire for open dialogue"". ""The people running our stores were being arrested going to prison, losing their life savings, having massive mental health issues.  It felt as though doing the right thing no longer mattered, it was all about saving the image of the Post Office"". He said: ""A fellow member of staff asked one manager why they thought there was such a high volume of fraud. The manager laughed and said 'because half the post offices are run by ex-police who took early retirement or former pub landlords so they're probably used to fiddling the books'. ""I think it was meant as a joke but it betrays a subtle contempt for the people on the front line."" Ron Warmington, from the forensic accountants 'Second Sight', was brought in by the Post Office in 2012 to look at around 150 cases. In his first ever broadcast interview, he told File on 4 that as his findings became more critical of the Post Office, it became increasingly difficult for him to access the information he needed. ""It's the way that corporations behave when things go wrong,"" he said. ""And it was in that area that we found it so strange, the way the Post Office was reacting, presumably to protect the brand."" In 2015, the Post Office ended the investigation without notice but not before Mr Warmington had spoken to dozens of postmasters. ""I've spent decades dealing with some of the worst criminals in the world,"" he said. ""What struck me here was that I wasn't dealing with people like that. ""These were ordinary people that had simply found something that they couldn't deal with. They sought help but didn't get it and were put in a situation that frankly was life-changing for them."" The Post Office declined an interview but said it has ""accepted its past shortcomings"" and ""sincerely apologised"" to those affected. File on 4's 'Second Class Citizens: The Post Office IT Scandal' is on BBC Radio 4 on Tuesday 11 February at 20:00 GMT and available afterwards on BBC Sounds.

"The UK government is considering taking a stake in troubled airline Flybe. The government is in talks with Flybe and the European Commission to ensure any rescue deal does not break state aid rules. Officials say support given to Flybe so far, such as a pledge to cut tax on some domestic routes, are industry-wide measures. However, the government is considering extending a loan of up to Â£100m to the loss-making airline. Government officials insist that any such loan will be on commercial terms but sources at competitors ask how the government can really mean that if the airline finds commercial lenders unavailable. There are different ways of answering those potential objections. First, charge an interest rate on a loan that fully reflects the risk that the government is taking with taxpayer money. This is the government's preferred option. Businesses with a loss-making track record should not be able to borrow at super-low interest rates when the risk of default is perceived as high. However, a loan at high rates of interest could damage the airline's ability to nurse itself back to health because of the hefty repayments required on a high interest loan. You would merely be kicking the can down the road. Another solution being floated - and described as ""possible"" by officials - is for the government to extend the loan but reserve the right to purchase shares at a pre arranged (low) price once the airline has returned to health. These rights, often described as ""warrants"", was the manner in which legendary investor Warren Buffett pumped money into investment bank Goldman Sachs during the financial crisis and there are few more commercially savvy financial first aid givers than he. A government loan to Flybe may be similar to a deal Warren Buffett struck with Goldman Sachs This approach makes it more likely the airline will be able to pay its debts, which in turn makes it more likely the airline will be worth more in the future, at which point UK taxpayers could reap rewards for the risk taken. Hey presto - a commercial arrangement thath helps the company now and sees the taxpayer share in any future success. To be clear, this is still uncomfortable territory for the government. However, it has become increasingly clear that it is prepared to push the envelope of what is possible in order to deliver on election commitments to improve regional connectivity to ""level-up"" Britain. A commitment that might look hollow if Flybe were to collapse. The EU has told the BBC it is in discussions with the government to ascertain whether financial assistance to Flybe provided to date or in the future could break EU competition rules. A spokesperson for the European Commission told the BBC that it is the responsibility of member states to decide whether support needs to be notified as state aid - which the UK insists it does not - unless other parties complain that such support is illegal and the EU can then investigate. British Airways' owner IAG and Ryanair have already done just that in letters to the European Commission over their concerns that the Flybe rescue announced in mid-January amounted to anti-competitive and therefore illegal support. IAG lodged a Freedom of Information request with the government seeking more detail about the extent of the support package. The deadline for the government to respond to that is this Thursday. British Airways-owner IAG has complained to the EC about UK government support for Flybe IAG boss Willie Walsh has pointed out that Flybe has wealthy owners including BA's arch-rival Virgin Airlines. Virgin, along with the Stobart haulage group and New York-based hedge fund Cyrus Capital, have agreed to put in Â£30m to Â£40m of their own money but that is thought to be insufficient to secure the long-term future of the airline and without a loan to get through the lean winter months, it remains in danger. Other things that have irritated rivals are Flybe's decision to switch its London-Newquay service from Heathrow to Gatwick - potentially freeing up a Heathrow slot for part owner Virgin Airlines and Flybe's expansion at Southend airport which just so happens to be owned by the Stobart group. It is not clear how much of the financial support from Flybe's owners has already been exhausted. The company said on Sunday that ""the airline is being supported by its shareholders and leading suppliers, is managing its cash position carefully and currently has strong liquidity"" There are many industry sources who insist that Flybe's problems are more deep-seated. Its business model is broken and the government is risking both wasting taxpayers' money AND creating a dangerous precedent for assisting failing businesses. As with many things being contemplated - the approval of HS2 despite ballooning costs, a potential mansion tax, prioritising fishing over finance, a raid on pension tax relief - we are dealing with a very different kind of Conservative government.

"HS2 platforms in Manchester Piccadilly would be covered by a folded roof The HS2 high-speed rail link between Birmingham and Manchester will be scrapped, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has said. Another part of the route, between the East Midlands and Leeds,has already been cancelled. Instead, Â£36bn funding will be put into alternative transport projects, Mr Sunak said. HS2 was intended to create high-speed rail links between London and major cities in the Midlands and North of England. That has been pared down to a high-speed link between Birmingham and London. It is aimed at cutting journey times, creating more space on the rail network and more jobs outside London. But HS2 has faced delays, spiralling costs and cuts. HS2 was meant to connectLondonwithBirmingham,ManchesterandLeeds. Lots of work has been done on the section linking London and Birmingham. Butthe government scrapped the Leeds leg in 2021,external. It decided to upgrade existing routes for HS2 trains, instead of building new ones. In June, the government said it would still build HS2 from London Euston to Manchester and the East Midlands. However,Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said recently that costs were getting ""totally out of control"". Now, thealready-delayedBirmingham to Manchester leg has been cancelled. The 13-mile (21km) Golborne Link to connect HS2 and the West Coast Main Line in Cheshire and Greater Manchesterhad already been scrapped. Speaking at the Conservative party conference, Mr Sunak said the latest decision would save Â£36bn, which would be used instead in ""hundreds of new transport projects in the North and the Midlands, and across the country"". This will include road and rail schemes. HS2 will now eventually run from London to Birmingham Interchange, with branches to central Birmingham and Handsacre, near Lichfield. HS2 trains for Manchester, Liverpool and Scotland will join the West Coast Main Line at Handsacre. The government previously said HS2 would cut Birmingham to London journey times from one hour 21 minutes, to 52 minutes. Before the link was scrapped, HS2 was projected to take an hour off Manchester to London journeys - from just over two hours to just over one hour. HS2 trains will still run to Manchester, and journey times will be cut between Manchester, Birmingham and London by up to 30 minutes, Mr Sunak said. HS2 was originally meant to reach Euston in central London, although demolition work was paused due to rising costs. The government said it would ""get a grip"" on plans for the station's ""unaffordable designs"". It has already cut the number of planned platforms for high-speed trains from 11 to six. But if cash is not put forward by private investorsthen the high-speed line will only run from Birmingham to Old Oak Commonin London's western suburbs. It is unclear whether the same capacity across the line will be needed now the HS2 line to Manchester has been discarded. The cost of the project, the biggest of its kind in Europe, has grown. The first estimate in 2010 was for about Â£33bn. The government's most recent official estimate was about Â£71bn in 2019 prices. But this included Â£26bn for Birmingham to Manchester, which will now not be built. The government is currently updating its cost estimates. About Â£24.7bn had been spent on HS2 as of February 2023. This includes at least Â£22.5bn on Phase 1 and Â£2.3bn on Phase 2, including on the purchase of more than 400 properties between Birmingham and Manchester. HS2: Six reasons why the rail route is so expensive HS2 was due to open by 2026. Under current plans, HS2 trains would carry their first passengers between Old Oak Common and Birmingham, between 2029 and 2033. Timescales for when Euston will open have yet to be announced. The government has announced the ""Network North"" scheme, with Â£36bn redirected from HS2 to road and rail projects. This will allow the objectives of the previous ""Northern Powerhouse Rail"" project to be met, it said. ""Network North"" plans including upgraded and electrified lines between Manchester and Sheffield, Sheffield and Leeds, Sheffield and Hull, and Hull and Leeds. In addition, there will be an extra Â£12bn set aside for faster links between Liverpool and Manchester. A section of the HS2 line was due to run from Manchester Airport to Manchester Piccadilly, the city's main station. Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham recently said scrapping the Manchester link ""rips the heart"" out of Northern Powerhouse Rail. However, the government said Northern Powerhouse Rail, including high speed rail links, will be delivered ""as previously planned"". Big decisions await as HS2 row simmers on What is levelling up and who is it helping? Mr Sunak diverting money from HS2 to road schemes ""shows how little he really cares about tackling air pollution, traffic and cutting carbon emissions"", Greenpeace says. Previously the HS2 project said it could provide ""zero carbon rail travel"" and create new wildlife habitats along its route. But environmental campaigners and conservation organisations had objected, saying it would destroy irreplaceable natural habitats. How much?
