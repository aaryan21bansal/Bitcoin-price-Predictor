"James from Sheffield has been waiting for his BTec results since Thursday An exam board has apologised after some BTec students did not receive their results as expected last Thursday, throwing university places into doubt. Pearson said a ""very small percentage"" of its BTec students were affected. Hundreds of thousands of students received their A-level, BTec and T-level results this week. One student told BBC News he has now missed his chance of a clearing place at his chosen university. James, 18, from Sheffield, did a BTec in uniformed public services at Sheffield College. As his friends celebrated their results on Thursday, he was sat refreshing the online results page. ""I was told I would hopefully get them by the end of the day but nothing came - it's been really stressful,"" he said. ""It's kind of just going around in a loop - not having my results, asking people where they are, being told to wait and still not getting them."" James, who applied to study law and criminology at Sheffield Hallam University, still does not know if he has secured a place. His plans to trade-up in clearing and read law at the University of Sheffield have fallen through as a result of the delay, he said. Another exam board, OCR, has also had delays issuing Cambridge Technicals results to some students. It says it will continue to process results over the weekend and it has ""delivered more than a thousand results to schools and colleges within the last 24 hours."" BTecs - Business and Technology Education Council qualifications - and Cambridge Technicals are vocational courses which are largely assessed through practical learning, with written exams accounting for just a small element of the final mark. In order to receive an overall grade, the marks from every module are required. Pearson has not said how many students are waiting, but that it is a ""very small percentage"". The exam board said it was working around the clock with colleges, adding staff would ""be here all weekend working to get results out as soon as we can"". It added that UCAS, the university and college admissions service, said the best thing these students can do is contact their university of choice directly and ask them to hold their place.

The chief executive of the Association of Colleges, David Hughes, says the delay has put extra pressure on students.

"Karen has been housesharing for five years The rising cost of renting and buying a house has led to more over-50s looking for house and flat-shares, according to property-sharing websites. It's something that is normally associated with younger people but what is it like sharing when you're over 50? Karen Miles, 66, moved into a 13-person house five years ago to save money. She was previously living in a one-bedroom flat just outside Eastbourne but struggled to cover her bills alongside rent of around Â£560 a month. Now she pays Â£500 a month for a room, excluding bills, in a shared house in the town. Her housemates are a mix of ages, ranging from early-20s to early-50s. While she gets on with everyone, they don't tend to socialise together and Karen, who works part-time as a housekeeper, said sharing with younger people can pose problems. 'Spending lockdown with my 88-year-old flatmate' Shortage of homes to rent leads to bidding wars She has previously had issues with some flatmates being noisy and the shared kitchen and bathroom can get dirty quickly. However, she said there were also benefits of having other people around to chat to. ""If I moved in somewhere on my own, I think I probably would feel a bit lonely,"" she added. Karen has tried to look for a one-bedroom flat to rent but with prices increasing she has struggled to find something affordable. She would also like to share with friends but said it can be difficult for older people to find someone of a similar age to rent with. ""My friends have got husbands and family so it's hard,"" she said. Leading flat-sharing site SpareRoom said it had seen a 239% increase in 55 to 64-year-olds looking for house-shares since 2011 and a 114% increase for the 45-to-54 age group. However people aged 25 to 34 years old still make up the majority of sharers. SpareRoom communications director Matt Hutchinson said the primary reason more older people were house-sharing was affordability. He told BBC News the increased cost of renting and buying a home meant more people were sharing for longer and becoming ""lifetime renters"", while people who had come out of long-term relationships and might originally have bought or rented a one-bedroom flat were now ""priced out"". Mr Hutchinson said he expected the trend to continue as housing and other costs increased further. Sarah Coles, a senior personal finance analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown,said official figures also suggest renters are getting older,external. She added that figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) suggest the cost of living crisis is felt more by renters than homeowners,external, as they spend a greater proportion of their income on housing. They are also more exposed to rent increases as many mortgage-holders are on fixed rates. Rental prices in the UK have been increasing steadily since Covid restrictions were eased in the summer of 2021,according to the ONS,external. High demand has contributed to rental prices increasing by 3.2% in the 12 months to July - the largest annual growth rate since January 2016. For April to June,property website Rightmove found average asking rents outside London hit a record Â£1,126 per month,external- up 11.8% on the same period last year. Cohabitas, a website which advertises house-shares for people over-40, also said it had seen increased demand from older age groups since it was founded in 2016. Over the past six months, it said it had seen a 44% increase in users compared to the same period last year. For 55 to 64-year-olds the increase was 51%, while for 45 to 54-year-olds it was 35%. Co-founder Eva Orasch said the long-term trends driving the increase in sharing among older age groups were the UK's ageing population and increased house prices. In the short-term, she said the rising cost of living and the pandemic were also contributing, with some people no longer wanting to live alone after lockdown. In a 2021 survey of more than 1,500 users, the website found 45% of respondents had chosen to share for purely financial reasons, while 48% were sharing for both financial and social reasons. Susan used to live on her own but has started housesharing to save money Susan Laybourn, 58, also started house-sharing to save money in March 2020. Most recently she has been sharing with a live-in landlady who is a similar age to her, as well as a man in his 20s, in Trefnant, north Wales. After getting a job in the area, Susan, who works as a locum podiatrist for the NHS, could not find anywhere affordable to rent on her own. Many houses in the area are let as holiday homes and Susan said demand for rented properties already outstripped supply. ""At one point, I did consider just trying to find somewhere on my own and there was a couple of flats going in Rhyl, which is nearby,"" she said. ""But by the time I rang up to inquire about them they said 'oh, sorry, they're already gone'."" She added that not having a permanent job and often needing a shorter-term rental contract because of this also counted against her when trying to find somewhere to rent. Young people living in tents due to house prices Rental costs jump as workers return to the office Ideally, Susan said she would prefer to live alone or with just one other person her own age - and she could afford to do so - but it was much cheaper to share. Her current room is Â£400 a month including bills. ""If I could find anywhere here on my own I'd probably be paying at least Â£200 more just for the rent, and then you've got bills on top,"" she said. ""And when you hear about energy bills are going to go through the roof and everything, I think I'm glad I'm not private renting [on my own] because I feel like I'd just be wasting money, when I could be saving it."" She would also like to buy her own flat in the future but believes her age and lack of permanent job means she would not be able to get a mortgage. Susan said she did enjoy having company, especially when moving to a new area, and she gets on well with her live-in landlady. However, she said it can be hard to find someone her own age to share with as there is still a stigma associated with older people house-sharing. In the past she said she felt ""almost ashamed"" that she was not able to rent her own place. ""I've kind of come to terms with it now and try to see the positives in it, rather than the negatives.""

"Households struggling with the rising cost of living in the UK will receive some help this winter, Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng has said. The cabinet minister, who is a key ally of Tory leadership hopeful Liz Truss, claimed the Treasury was ""working on options for the new prime minister"". But he fell short of outlining how the government intends to support people. Since declaring his support of Ms Truss, Mr Kwarteng has been linked to the chancellor position. Writing in the Mail on Sunday,external, he said he understood the ""deep anxiety"" price rises were causing, and acknowledged the ""millions of families [who] will be concerned about how they are going make ends meet"". ""But I want to reassure the British people that help is coming,"" Mr Kwarteng wrote. He went on to insist that Ms Truss ""will do all she can to help households across Britain"" if selected to become party leader and prime minister. He insisted Ms Truss' pledges to reverse an increase to National Insurance and introduce a temporary moratorium on energy levies were examples of her willingness to ""look at what more can be done"". In aninterview with the Sun on Sunday,external, Ms Truss also suggested families and businesses would be offered some kind of help with soaring bills under her - but she too gave little detail. She said every government ""has to look at making sure life is affordable for people"" and she is looking at help ""across the board"". The paper also reports,externalthat, under plans drawn up by the Treasury, doctors would be able to write prescriptions to give people money off their energy bills. Under the proposal, GPs would hold a patient consultation and verify they need help, before writing a prescription. Money would then either be given in cash or as a voucher. In a fortnight, we'll find out who is the UK's next prime minister. The cost of living will dominate the early days of Liz Truss or Rishi Sunak's government. Kwasi Kwarteng is a close ally of Ms Truss - and seen by many as the most likely choice for chancellor in a Truss government. He isn't providing new details of what she'd do today - he argues the new PM will need the full facts before making their decision. But Mr Kwarteng is seeking to provide some assurance: help will be on its way and the next No 10 operation will be able to hit the ground running. Some of Mr Sunak's allies question whether Ms Truss will be able to afford both her expensive tax cutting policy and a significant assistance programme to help with rising energy bills. Mr Sunak has provided a few more details of his intentions; pledging to cut VAT on energy bills and target extra help at those who need it most. But we won't know for sure what either plan means until one of them becomes prime minister in two weeks' time. The cost-of-living crisis has been driven by a series of issues, including inflation outstripping wage increases and record energy bills due to a surge in wholesale gas prices. Anew price cap- determining the maximum suppliers can charge customers for energy usage in England, Scotland and Wales - is due to be announced at the end of this month. It will come into effect in October - and customers have been warned to expect annual bills to reach more than Â£3,500. Energy consultancy Auxilione used Friday's wholesale gas prices to suggest typical household energy bills in the UK could hit as much as Â£6,000 a year next April. Mr Kwarteng gave no detail about the government's apparent plans to help households and businesses with soaring prices. Instead, he said this would be made clear when the new prime minister takes office. As one of Ms Truss' earliest backers, it is widely thought Mr Kwarteng will be handed one of the more senior cabinet positions, should she win. Reports have suggested he could become the next chancellor, but Ms Truss' campaign team insist no decisions have been made yet. How high will my energy bill go? Why inflation is worse for some people than others Energy bills could go up before October price rise The leadership race between Ms Truss and former chancellor Rishi Sunak will conclude on 5 September, with a winner announced and their top teams to follow soon after. At that point, the UK's new leader will have the ""full information and analysis"" to work up the ""best package measures that will help deal with"" cost of living issues, Mr Kwarteng wrote. He said energy independence will be key for Ms Truss, promising more nuclear power stations, offshore wind and a lifting of the ban on fracking in areas where there is local consent. Mr Kwarteng, an opponent of windfall taxes, added: ""Rather than slapping a punitive windfall tax, as Rishi Sunak has done, we need to incentivise investment in domestic oil and gas for our own energy security. ""I appreciate windfall taxes are sometimes popular. But popularity won't keep the lights on."" Labour has pledged to extend the oil and gas windfall tax to fund a freeze to the energy price capat its current level of Â£1,971 for six months.

Until next time, bye for now. Kal SajadBBC Sport at King Abdullah Sports City Arena, Jeddah Briton Anthony Joshua's bid to recapture the unified heavyweight titlesended in disappointment as Oleksandr Usykproduced a terrific performance to win by split decision in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. In a clash billed as the Rage on the Red Sea, a spirited Joshua, 32, showed some aggressiveness and intent - a vast improvement from their first fight - but could not match the brilliance and ring savviness of the Ukrainian. Two judges scored the fight 115-113 and 116-112 to Usyk, while a third judge gave it 115-113 to the challenger. While there were some close rounds, Usyk was the deserved winner. Joshua suffers back-to-back defeats to Usyk, with the Ukrainian retaining the WBA (Super), WBO and IBF titles he won in London last September. At the end of the fight, the challenger picked up two of Usyk's belts, dropped them on the floor and strode towards the dressing room, before turning round and getting back into the ring. ""Usyk is one hell of a fighter. That's just emotion,"" he said. ""If you knew my story, you'd understand the passion. I'm not an amateur boxer. I was going to jail and I got bail and I started training. ""It shows the passion we put into this. For this guy to beat me tonight, it shows the levels of hard work he must have put in, so please give him a round of applause as heavyweight champion of world. ""They said that I'm not a 12-round fighter. I ain't 14 stone, I'm 18 stone, I'm heavy. It's hard work. This guy here is phenomenal."" Listen below to hear Tyson Fury's reaction at the end of the Usyk v Joshua fight. This video can not be played Tyson Fury shares his disappointment watching Joshua v Usyk. Where next for AJ? That's three defeats he's had now in his career, but there are still huge fights out there for him if he wants them. #bbcboxing Sauce:As big an improvement it was from AJ, he was never going to beat Usyk who is simply a class above. Any time Usyk was in trouble he dug deep and countered even better. No shame in losing to such talent Adam:Anthony Joshua was so frustrating to watch tonight. Gets himself in to good positions, with Usyk on the back foot and backs off. Needed to follow up and get nasty. People out there really think he beats Fury. C'mon now! Rob:AJ gave it his best shot, Usyk was just better! Good fight with some fantastic punches. AJ needs to get back to what he does best, throwing bombs! Tyson Fury, who holds the WBC heavyweight belt, has given his reaction on Instagram to Oleksandr Usyk's win and it's fair to say he isn't impressed with what he saw. ""After watching that, I can say that's one of the worst heavyweight fights I've ever seen,"" he put on his Instagram story. ""I would annihilate both of them on the same night.

Joshua was lucky to get a split decision. For all the talk of letting his hands go I didn't really see that to the extent I expected. Joshua:Joshua has been let down badly by his team before the fight with his game plan, during the fight telling him he was doing well and after the fight letting him make that speech. Horrible to watch. Anthony Joshua's promoter Eddie Hearn, speaking ringside after the fight:""What a performance from Oleksandr Usyk. I thought we had him but the 10th
round was one of the best rounds Iâve ever seen. ""What he did in the 10th, 11th, 12th rounds were incredible. AJ didnât start fast enough but he fought a much better fight than last time. He hurt him
in the ninth but Usyk came on like a train. ""In the 10th round, Usyk decided to regain the fight. Heâs too good. Thereâs no shame in it. You saw the reaction from AJ, from a human who wanted to win so badly and he exploded. ""He
couldnât win, heâs a competitor, a winner. But he was too good. Thatâs why heâs the best pound-for-pound fighter. I felt Usyk won because of the 10th,11th and 12th rounds. I had it very close going into those rounds but the championship
rounds showed from championship fighter that he is a pound-for-pound great. ""AJ gave it everything - he had a great training camp and was desperate to win tonight but it wasnât to be. He lost a split decision to the pound-for-pound number one. He has to go away, rebuild, get his frustration out and be happy. Thatâs the most important thing On a potential Usyk fight with Tyson Fury:""Both
him and Fury are tremendous fighters. Fury is a clever man. He had chance to fight Usyk before and chose not to. I'm not sure anyone can beat Usyk. We've been listening back to what Anthony Joshua said to Oleksandr Usyk in the ring after the fight. Joshua said: ""You're not strong, how did you beat me? Because of skills. ""I had character and determination."" Oleksandr Usyk after beating Anthony Joshua:""I want to thank everyone who prayed for me. I
want to thank God for the help he gave me today because he did give me a lot
today. My lord is Jesus Christ. I can thank you Saudi. Thank you so much. ""I devote this victory to my family, my country,
my team, to all the military defending this country. Thank you so much. ""This is already history. Many generations are
going to watch this fight especially the round when someone tried to beat me
hard but I stood it and came back."" On whether he will fight Tyson Fury to unify the titles:""Iâm sure that Tyson Fury is not retired yet. Iâm
convinced he wants to fight me. I want to fight him. If Iâm not fighting Fury
Iâm not fighting at all. ""Only God knows whether I will fight him or not
but all these gentlemen here around me, my team, they are going to help me. ""Thanks
Lord for everything."" A very bizarre end after the verdicts had been announced with Anthony Joshua grabbing the microphone first, before the winner Oleksandr Usyk got to speak. Joshua had also nearly left the arena before returning to the ring. Anthony Joshua taking the ringside microphone:""Usyk is one hell of a fighter. Thatâs just emotion. ""If you knew my story, you'd understand the
passion. Iâm not an amateur boxer. I was
going to jail and I got bail and I started training. If I got sentenced, I wouldn't be able to fight. ""It shows the passion we put into this. For this guy to beat me tonight, it shows the levels
of hard work he must have put in so please give him a round of applause as
heavyweight champion of world. ""They said that Iâm not a 12-round fighter. I ainât 14 stone, Iâm 18 stone, I'm heavy. Itâs hard work. This guy here is phenomenal."" Speaking to Usyk directly:""I was studying Ukraine and all the champions
from your amazing country. Iâve never been there. Whatâs happening there, I
donât know but itâs not nice. For Usyk to be champion, under those circumstances, please raise your hands."" #bbcboxing Ihtisham:End of Anthony Joshua's title charge.

"Jonah Hill says he has ""spent nearly 20 years experiencing anxiety attacks"" Jonah Hill has announced he will stop promoting his films to protect his mental health. The Superbad actor said he had suffered from anxiety attacks for 20 years, which were ""exacerbated by media appearances and public facing events"". He will not do any promotion for his new documentary, Stutz, which is about his relationship with a therapist. Psychologist Dr Sandra Wheatley told Radio 1 Newsbeat his decision was ""a really important message"". She said the fact that ""somebody who has so much to lose is actually prepared to step back"" should be applauded. Jonah, 38, opened up about his mental health inan open letter published by Deadline,externalahead of Stutz, which he directed and is about the therapist he began seeing in 2017. The film was shot in secret and follows the Hollywood star's journey with his therapist, while exploring mental health in general. ""I have come to the understanding that I have spent nearly 20 years experiencing anxiety attacks, which are exacerbated by media appearances and public facing events,"" he said in the letter. ""I am so grateful that the film will make its world premiere at a prestigious film festival... and I can't wait to share it with audiences around the world in the hope that it will help those struggling. ""However, you won't see me out there promoting this film, or any of my upcoming films, while I take this important step to protect myself."" The 21 Jump Street actor thanked people for their support Dr Wheatley, a chartered member of the British Psychological Society, told Newsbeat that when celebrities are on stage or at a film premiere they're still performing. ""But when they're offstage, they go back to who they really are,"" she said. ""So celebrities have to remember this persona in the media is an impersonation that you have, not you as an individual and that can be hard to balance."" Consultant psychologist Dr Elena Bailey agrees that celebrities are ""very vulnerable"" when they're in the public eye. Dr Bailey, who works at The Chelsea Psychology Clinic, said stepping away from the media was a ""self-protective behaviour"". ""This is because the type of attention and feedback and commentary on your life can have a very big impact on your mental health, causing a lot of anxiety, negative thoughts, symptoms of depression,"" she said. Tom Holland takes social media break for mental health Social media 'damages teens' mental health' Black Mirror actor quits Twitter for mental health Spiderman actor Tom Holland recently announced on Instagram he was taking a break from social media as he found it ""overwhelming"". And last year, actor Ryan Reynolds discussed how anxiety had an impact on his life and work. ""For those who are working in the media, social media becomes a job, it becomes self-promotion,"" Dr Wheatley said. ""The public would put something up on their social media pages and it's for a chosen audience, like friends or family. ""But for celebrities it's a very absent audience so they don't know how it's going to be received, which ultimately sets a very different objective and why their anxiety is heightened.""

Could he fight WBC champion Tyson Fury for all the gold? Lennox Lewis, the last undisputed heavyweight champion, certainly thinks so. Allow Twitter content?

Until next time, bye for now. Kal SajadBBC Sport at King Abdullah Sports City Arena, Jeddah Briton Anthony Joshua's bid to recapture the unified heavyweight titlesended in disappointment as Oleksandr Usykproduced a terrific performance to win by split decision in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. In a clash billed as the Rage on the Red Sea, a spirited Joshua, 32, showed some aggressiveness and intent - a vast improvement from their first fight - but could not match the brilliance and ring savviness of the Ukrainian. Two judges scored the fight 115-113 and 116-112 to Usyk, while a third judge gave it 115-113 to the challenger. While there were some close rounds, Usyk was the deserved winner. Joshua suffers back-to-back defeats to Usyk, with the Ukrainian retaining the WBA (Super), WBO and IBF titles he won in London last September. At the end of the fight, the challenger picked up two of Usyk's belts, dropped them on the floor and strode towards the dressing room, before turning round and getting back into the ring. ""Usyk is one hell of a fighter. That's just emotion,"" he said. ""If you knew my story, you'd understand the passion. I'm not an amateur boxer. I was going to jail and I got bail and I started training. ""It shows the passion we put into this. For this guy to beat me tonight, it shows the levels of hard work he must have put in, so please give him a round of applause as heavyweight champion of world. ""They said that I'm not a 12-round fighter. I ain't 14 stone, I'm 18 stone, I'm heavy. It's hard work. This guy here is phenomenal."" Listen below to hear Tyson Fury's reaction at the end of the Usyk v Joshua fight. This video can not be played Tyson Fury shares his disappointment watching Joshua v Usyk. Where next for AJ? That's three defeats he's had now in his career, but there are still huge fights out there for him if he wants them. #bbcboxing Sauce:As big an improvement it was from AJ, he was never going to beat Usyk who is simply a class above. Any time Usyk was in trouble he dug deep and countered even better. No shame in losing to such talent Adam:Anthony Joshua was so frustrating to watch tonight. Gets himself in to good positions, with Usyk on the back foot and backs off. Needed to follow up and get nasty. People out there really think he beats Fury. C'mon now! Rob:AJ gave it his best shot, Usyk was just better! Good fight with some fantastic punches. AJ needs to get back to what he does best, throwing bombs! Tyson Fury, who holds the WBC heavyweight belt, has given his reaction on Instagram to Oleksandr Usyk's win and it's fair to say he isn't impressed with what he saw. ""After watching that, I can say that's one of the worst heavyweight fights I've ever seen,"" he put on his Instagram story. ""I would annihilate both of them on the same night. ""Get your chequebook out because the Gypsy King is here to stay forever."" Some reaction from big names in boxing... Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Joshua was lucky to get a split decision. For all the talk of letting his hands go I didn't really see that to the extent I expected. Joshua:Joshua has been let down badly by his team before the fight with his game plan, during the fight telling him he was doing well and after the fight letting him make that speech. Horrible to watch. Anthony Joshua's promoter Eddie Hearn, speaking ringside after the fight:""What a performance from Oleksandr Usyk. I thought we had him but the 10th
round was one of the best rounds Iâve ever seen. ""What he did in the 10th, 11th, 12th rounds were incredible. AJ didnât start fast enough but he fought a much better fight than last time. He hurt him
in the ninth but Usyk came on like a train. ""In the 10th round, Usyk decided to regain the fight. Heâs too good. Thereâs no shame in it. You saw the reaction from AJ, from a human who wanted to win so badly and he exploded. ""He
couldnât win, heâs a competitor, a winner. But he was too good. Thatâs why heâs the best pound-for-pound fighter. I felt Usyk won because of the 10th,11th and 12th rounds. I had it very close going into those rounds but the championship
rounds showed from championship fighter that he is a pound-for-pound great. ""AJ gave it everything - he had a great training camp and was desperate to win tonight but it wasnât to be. He lost a split decision to the pound-for-pound number one. He has to go away, rebuild, get his frustration out and be happy. Thatâs the most important thing On a potential Usyk fight with Tyson Fury:""Both
him and Fury are tremendous fighters. Fury is a clever man. He had chance to fight Usyk before and chose not to. I'm not sure anyone can beat Usyk. We've been listening back to what Anthony Joshua said to Oleksandr Usyk in the ring after the fight. Joshua said: ""You're not strong, how did you beat me? Because of skills. ""I had character and determination."" Oleksandr Usyk after beating Anthony Joshua:""I want to thank everyone who prayed for me. I
want to thank God for the help he gave me today because he did give me a lot
today. My lord is Jesus Christ. I can thank you Saudi. Thank you so much. ""I devote this victory to my family, my country,
my team, to all the military defending this country. Thank you so much. ""This is already history. Many generations are
going to watch this fight especially the round when someone tried to beat me
hard but I stood it and came back."" On whether he will fight Tyson Fury to unify the titles:""Iâm sure that Tyson Fury is not retired yet. Iâm
convinced he wants to fight me. I want to fight him. If Iâm not fighting Fury
Iâm not fighting at all. ""Only God knows whether I will fight him or not
but all these gentlemen here around me, my team, they are going to help me. ""Thanks
Lord for everything."" A very bizarre end after the verdicts had been announced with Anthony Joshua grabbing the microphone first, before the winner Oleksandr Usyk got to speak. Joshua had also nearly left the arena before returning to the ring. Anthony Joshua taking the ringside microphone:""Usyk is one hell of a fighter. Thatâs just emotion. ""If you knew my story, you'd understand the
passion. Iâm not an amateur boxer. I was
going to jail and I got bail and I started training. If I got sentenced, I wouldn't be able to fight. ""It shows the passion we put into this. For this guy to beat me tonight, it shows the levels
of hard work he must have put in so please give him a round of applause as
heavyweight champion of world. ""They said that Iâm not a 12-round fighter. I ainât 14 stone, Iâm 18 stone, I'm heavy. Itâs hard work. This guy here is phenomenal."" Speaking to Usyk directly:""I was studying Ukraine and all the champions
from your amazing country. Iâve never been there. Whatâs happening there, I
donât know but itâs not nice. For Usyk to be champion, under those circumstances, please raise your hands."" #bbcboxing Ihtisham:End of Anthony Joshua's title charge. Should get some wins back in his locker before challenging again! Jose:Usykâs ringcraft is next level, but he has no punching power at heavyweight. boring fight, winning with scoreboard punches and no threat. Conrad:Massive respect to Usyk. With everything going on in his homeland to come here and put on a display, he is a worthy world champion. Former WBC heavyweight title holder Deontay Wilder. Allow Twitter content?

Anthony Joshua appears to have calmed down and grabs the microphone and asks the crowd to applaud Usyk. He then praises Usyk and for winning the titles despite everything he and Ukraine has gone through. Joshua had picked up two of the belts, then dropped them on the ground before marching towards the dressing room. He got close to leaving the arena, before then heading back to the ring. Oleksandr Usyk is still the world heavyweight champion - he wins it on a split decision. The first judge had it 115-113 to Joshua, the second 115-113 to Usyk and the third 116-112 to Usyk. USYK RETAINS THE IBF, IBO, WBA (SUPER) AND WBO HEAVYWEIGHT TITLES. We wait for the judges. Both fighters are holding the Ukrainian flag aloft. A great touch.  Allow Twitter content?

"Households struggling with the rising cost of living in the UK will receive some help this winter, Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng has said. The cabinet minister, who is a key ally of Tory leadership hopeful Liz Truss, claimed the Treasury was ""working on options for the new prime minister"". But he fell short of outlining how the government intends to support people. Since declaring his support of Ms Truss, Mr Kwarteng has been linked to the chancellor position. Writing in the Mail on Sunday,external, he said he understood the ""deep anxiety"" price rises were causing, and acknowledged the ""millions of families [who] will be concerned about how they are going make ends meet"". ""But I want to reassure the British people that help is coming,"" Mr Kwarteng wrote. He went on to insist that Ms Truss ""will do all she can to help households across Britain"" if selected to become party leader and prime minister. He insisted Ms Truss' pledges to reverse an increase to National Insurance and introduce a temporary moratorium on energy levies were examples of her willingness to ""look at what more can be done"". In aninterview with the Sun on Sunday,external, Ms Truss also suggested families and businesses would be offered some kind of help with soaring bills under her - but she too gave little detail. She said every government ""has to look at making sure life is affordable for people"" and she is looking at help ""across the board"". The paper also reports,externalthat, under plans drawn up by the Treasury, doctors would be able to write prescriptions to give people money off their energy bills. Under the proposal, GPs would hold a patient consultation and verify they need help, before writing a prescription. Money would then either be given in cash or as a voucher. In a fortnight, we'll find out who is the UK's next prime minister. The cost of living will dominate the early days of Liz Truss or Rishi Sunak's government. Kwasi Kwarteng is a close ally of Ms Truss - and seen by many as the most likely choice for chancellor in a Truss government. He isn't providing new details of what she'd do today - he argues the new PM will need the full facts before making their decision. But Mr Kwarteng is seeking to provide some assurance: help will be on its way and the next No 10 operation will be able to hit the ground running. Some of Mr Sunak's allies question whether Ms Truss will be able to afford both her expensive tax cutting policy and a significant assistance programme to help with rising energy bills. Mr Sunak has provided a few more details of his intentions; pledging to cut VAT on energy bills and target extra help at those who need it most. But we won't know for sure what either plan means until one of them becomes prime minister in two weeks' time. The cost-of-living crisis has been driven by a series of issues, including inflation outstripping wage increases and record energy bills due to a surge in wholesale gas prices. Anew price cap- determining the maximum suppliers can charge customers for energy usage in England, Scotland and Wales - is due to be announced at the end of this month. It will come into effect in October - and customers have been warned to expect annual bills to reach more than Â£3,500. Energy consultancy Auxilione used Friday's wholesale gas prices to suggest typical household energy bills in the UK could hit as much as Â£6,000 a year next April. Mr Kwarteng gave no detail about the government's apparent plans to help households and businesses with soaring prices. Instead, he said this would be made clear when the new prime minister takes office. As one of Ms Truss' earliest backers, it is widely thought Mr Kwarteng will be handed one of the more senior cabinet positions, should she win. Reports have suggested he could become the next chancellor, but Ms Truss' campaign team insist no decisions have been made yet. How high will my energy bill go? Why inflation is worse for some people than others Energy bills could go up before October price rise The leadership race between Ms Truss and former chancellor Rishi Sunak will conclude on 5 September, with a winner announced and their top teams to follow soon after. At that point, the UK's new leader will have the ""full information and analysis"" to work up the ""best package measures that will help deal with"" cost of living issues, Mr Kwarteng wrote. He said energy independence will be key for Ms Truss, promising more nuclear power stations, offshore wind and a lifting of the ban on fracking in areas where there is local consent. Mr Kwarteng, an opponent of windfall taxes, added: ""Rather than slapping a punitive windfall tax, as Rishi Sunak has done, we need to incentivise investment in domestic oil and gas for our own energy security. ""I appreciate windfall taxes are sometimes popular. But popularity won't keep the lights on."" Labour has pledged to extend the oil and gas windfall tax to fund a freeze to the energy price capat its current level of Â£1,971 for six months.

"Ukrainian emergency rescuers attend an exercise in case of a possible nuclear incident at Zaporizhzhia's nuclear plant. It is relatively unusual in Ukraine for a government official to invite you on a short-notice trip. It turns out it is more common for that invitation to come with very little detail. The main reason for that is security - it is not exactly wise to publicise when a minister is going to be somewhere, especially when you are being invaded by another country. We decided to accept, and soon found ourselves at an airfield near Kyiv, where we and other journalists were led onto a helicopter. By this point we knew our destination was the city of Zaporizhzhia, and the subject was the growing danger from the region's nuclear power plant further south. Within 30 seconds of the journey starting, I realised why we were offered anti-nausea tablets before taking off. To stay undetected, the pilot keeps the helicopter around 10 metres off the ground, occasionally hurdling over electric powerlines. There are endless fields of sunflowers. Some are in full bloom, some are wilting, past their best. Regardless, the harvest is fast approaching. Then there is the dense woodland - thousands upon thousands of towering trees which come so close to touching the skids of the chopper. You are left under no illusion of Ukraine's vast and rich landscape. After landing in Zaporizhzhia, you are struck by two things: the more industrial skyline in comparison to Kyiv, as well as the humidity. We end up at a supermarket car park where emergency workers are dressed in yellow hazmat suits. They are practising cleaning drills in the event of a radioactive contamination. Ukraine's last nuclear crisis was the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear incident, when a Soviet-era reactor exploded. They are watched by senior officials, who are keen to see how ready the region would be in the event of a worst-case scenario. ""Of course we are concerned,"" Ukraine's Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko tells me. ""The situation changed dramatically when the Russians started shelling the area on 5 August."" Ukraine says the situation at the plant is ""approaching critical"". Russian forces have occupied the site, Europe's biggest, since early March. They have been urged to hand control back because of the dangers, and some staff there have told the BBC they're ""being kept at gunpoint"". For the past two weeks there's been heavy shelling on and around the plant, with the sides blaming each other. Nato is the latest international organisation to call for United Nations inspectors to be let into the Zaporizhzhia power plant, claiming its seizure posed a serious threat to Ukraine and neighbouring countries. Ukraine nuclear workers: We're kept at gunpoint Real risk of nuclear disaster in Ukraine - watchdog Officials say the plant could be cut off from power as Moscow tries to redirect electricity to Crimea, which it annexed eight years ago. ""It is impossible to ensure the safety of the nuclear power plant while the Russian occupying forces are there,"" says Denys Monastyrskyy, Ukraine's interior minister. ""It is the key concern that we all should understand,"" he adds. Ukraineâs Interior Minister Denys Monastyrskyy says the situation at the plant is âapproaching criticalâ The car park is also a place where Ukrainians who manage to make it out of Russian-occupied territories first arrive. There are queues of cars with people and full suitcases. Sitting in the shade we meet Olena, who has just made it out of the city of Enerhodar, where the nuclear plant is located. ""It's scary, very scary, there is shelling all the time,"" she says while bouncing her toddler on her knee. ""There have been many more explosions and it became too dangerous to stay there. ""I didn't want to leave home, but I had no choice."" This car park represents Ukraine controlling what it can. Unable to force the Russians from Europe's biggest nuclear power plant, the country is instead trying to prepare for the worst, if it happens.

demeanour and body language and at times and not understanding what we need to be
against a top side. ""We lacked an endeavour and real desire to
understand how the game looked. ""At half-time the most important thing was to
make the players understand what we really wanted from the game. We need to
show certain elements of what we showed second half and not first half. ""The first half was a difficult half. They came out of
the blocks and they are a very good team. When you are us you cannot lose hope
and I just felt we lost that a little bit. The players need to understand what we need to
bring and we just fell short of that."" FT: Bournemouth 0-3 Arsenal Bournemouth Bournemouth boss Scott Parker, speaking to Sky Sports:""First half was really unacceptable from us in many ways. We needed to have humility in terms of understanding the dynamics of the game and what we were up against. ""I thought our body language and what we needed, we were nowhere near it. Without that, when you're a team like us, there's no disgrace losing to Arsenal but what is not acceptable is how we went about it in the first half. ""There was a reaction in the second half but it was not enough and we need to understand that first-half performance. ""I didn't expect to see what I saw in the first half. I expected them to show a certain ingredient which we didn't show and it was far too easy in terms of recovery runs, getting back into shape and the quality we were playing against.

Not just goals and assists, but with the link-up play with how he drops down so we're lucky to have him."" Saliba's brilliant finish:""I've never seen him do that in training but it was a great strike. I'm really happy for him. He did really well in the last game too so I'm happy for him.

Great day. Three wins from three. ""We want to own the ball and the pitch and we did that from minute one to 45. We lost that a bit in the second half but the third goal, I don't know where he's pulled that from. ""It's crazy how our mentality has changed from the end of last season. We're more ruthless.

Two fantastic signings - Oleksandr Zinchenko will win points for any team just with his work rate, never mind his great play, and Gabriel Jesus is much more of an Arsenal player than a City player so their gain is greater than City's loss.

Very early days but they lost their first 3 games last season and they're about to win their first 3 in a row. Arsenal will be top of the Premier league tonight. At the very least something to be built upon by Mikel Arteta. This team is playing with confidence, some defensive errors that will be tested but a huge improvement from recent campaigns for Arsenal now. Bournemouth 0-3 Arsenal A straight forward victory for a mightily impressive Arsenal side, who go top of the table at this early juncture. It's a north London one-two at the moment.

"Dan James has managed to stop smoking after taking it up when he was 12 Could Wales really be smoke-free in the next eight years? The first steps are in place, with the aim by the Welsh government to reduce smoking rates in adults to 5% or less by 2030. One ex-smoker Dan James, 28, who began when he was 12, said he thought 2030 was a realistic target. However, lobby group Forest called on the target to be scrapped, saying the only way it could be achieved was through ""bullying and coercion"". According to the Welsh government,,externala smoke-free Wales ""means achieving a smoking prevalence rate in adults of 5% or less,"" and at that level ""the tobacco epidemic could become unsustainable"". The strategy aims to reduce inequalities, with a specific emphasis on future generations. Mr James quit smoking earlier this year, and said the Welsh government had a chance of making Wales smoke-free by 2030, as more advertising the assistance available ""will help people with their choices"". Plan to make Wales 'smoke-free' by 2030 Should smoking be banned in Wales' beer gardens? Council to pay pregnant smokers Â£400 to quit Dan, who lives in Cardiff Bay, had tried unsuccessfully to give up once, before finally kicking the habit. ""In 2019, I quit smoking but only managed it for a year. I called my doctor to help me quit smoking and spoke to an adviser."" Dan started figure skating before he quit smoking and said one of the main reasons was so he would be fitter for his sport After quitting, Dan has days where he craves cigarettes, but said he felt much fitter now when on the ice. He said: ""I'm not coughing up mucus now, I generally feel healthier and I can taste my food."" Ruth Billingham, 42, from Cardiff, has been smoking on and off since she was a teenager. She had long periods of not smoking, and has gone back to it due in social situations. She said: ""When I started smoking you could smoke inside pubs. I think it's a good thing that people aren't allowed to smoke in public places because I definitely would not have smoked as much as I have. ""At times when I've given up, I might start again because I'm on a night out, and it's just easy to have a cigarette. ""I would find it frustrating that I couldn't smoke outdoors. However, I do think in the long term it would be better for me because I wouldn't be able to smoke."" Ruth Billingham says it's easy to light up on a cigarette on a night out She was unsure whether the Welsh government would reach its ambition by 2030. ""There's eight years and if you can smoke in fewer places that will help. ""It's a good ambition, whether it's achievable I'm not totally sure, but if they bring in a ban in public places it will help. ""People might say 'oh I'm not going out any more', but they will. They will just adapt to the change and smoke fewer cigarettes."" The Welsh government's plans do not include e-cigarettes. However it said its strategy to deliver a smoke-free Wales did include discouraging e-cigarettes or other nicotine products by teenagers and young people. Deputy Minister for Mental Health and Wellbeing Lynne Neagle said: ""Whilst around 13% of people in Wales are smokers, we know that those living in our more deprived communities are much more likely to smoke than those in the least deprived areas."" A 2021 lifestyle survey revealed 13% of adults in Wales smoke, down from 19% five years before. But that number jumped to 22% in the most deprived communities. Source: National Survey for Wales (2021). The number of smokers in Wales is gradually declining Simon Clark, director of the smokers' lobby group Forest, said: ""Tobacco is a legal product and if adults choose to smoke that's a matter for them, not government. They cannot be forced to quit. ""The best way to further reduce smoking rates is not by introducing more anti-smoking measures but by educating young people about the health risks of smoking and encouraging existing smokers to switch to reduced risk products like e-cigarettes."" Hospital grounds Public playgrounds School grounds Holiday and temporary accommodation Mental health units (from 1 September) However, Ash Wales, which wants a smoke-free Wales, said the country supported the new strategy. Suzanne Cass, chief executive of the group, said: ""73% of Welsh adults want Wales to become smoke-free. ""The Welsh government's commitment to this target is welcome. However, this bold strategy is going to need bold and decisive action to hit that 5% target by 2030."" Smoking kills more than 5,000 Welsh adults every year, according to Ash Wales Figures released last month revealed 4% of the estimated Welsh smoking population made an attempt to quit via smoking cessation services from April 2021 to March 2022. This equated to 14,574 of 357,745 Welsh smokers. Smoking is the lead cause of premature death in Wales and is estimated to cost the Welsh NHS Â£302m per year. According to modelling by Cancer Research in 2020, if the current trajectory were to continue, Wales would not achieve smoke-free status until 2037. Katie Till, public affairs manager in Wales for Cancer Research UK, said: ""Smoking remains the biggest preventable cause of cancer and is responsible for around 3,100 cancer cases in Wales every year."" A YouGov survey in 2021 revealed 67% of people would support banning smoking in outdoor eating areas, such as pubs restaurants and cafes. A further 81% believed smoking should be banned in outdoor areas where children play sport. It has been illegal to smoke in a car with children since 2015 in both Wales and England Other countries have also voiced ambitions to achieve a 5% smoking rate, including Scotland, England and Ireland. Internationally, 5% is often regarded as the rate when the tobacco epidemic is considered unsustainable. The next smoking delivery plan will be published in 2024.

"Top A-level grades have risen for students across England, Wales and Northern Ireland for the first time since 2021. Overall this year 28% of all grades were A* or A - up from 27.2% in 2023. However the figures vary between the three nations, rising in England but falling in Wales and Northern Ireland. Here is what you need to know about everything from grade boundaries to clearing. You can normally pick up AS and A-level results in person anytime from 08:00 BST. However, some students receive their results via email. Check with your school or college about the arrangements in place for you. How much does uni cost and does it boost earnings? Everything you need to know about student loans Surprised by your results? Our interactive guide on what to do next Each exam is graded on a scale from A* to E. Grade boundaries show the minimum number of marks you need for each grade. They are decided by examiners and published on results day. Qualifications Wales, which oversees Welsh exams, had been prepared to use statistics to set the grade boundaries to prevent marks dropping significantly below 2019 levels, because of a concern that performance in some subjects had still not recovered fully since the pandemic. That back-up plan was not needed. In England and Northern Ireland the way boundaries are decided has returned to normal. Ucas is a charity which runs a clearing process,externalmatching students with university and college courses which still have spaces. Students can use it if they: fail to achieve the grades for their conditional offer fail to receive any offers they want to accept decide after 30 June to apply for university achieve better grades than expected and want to change universities Clearing is now open and closes on 21 October. Universities make an offer to a student to join a course based on qualifications and grades or theUcas tariff points system,external. Each A-level grade is worth a certain number of Ucas points. For example, an A* is worth 56 points and a D is worth 24 points. Many students decide not to go to university and start an apprenticeship or go straight into work. Others take agap year,externalso they have more time to decide what to do next. What are apprenticeships and how do I choose a good one? If you do not think your grade is right, you should talk to your school or college. It will contact the exam board on your behalf and ask for your marks to be reviewed. If you still think you have been unfairly graded after a review,you can ask your school or college to appeal,external. The exam board will consider whether a correction is needed. If you are still not satisfied, you can request a review from the exams regulator Ofqual. The charity YoungMinds points out thatexam results are not the only measure of success,external- and if things do not turn out how you had hoped, there are lots of ways to get where you want to. If you only just miss out on the grades you need to get on to a university or college course, the admissions office might accept you anyway or offer you a place on a different course. You could also try clearing. It may also be possible to resit some or all of your exams. Talk to your school or college if you want to explore this route. Resits will take place in May or June 2025.

"More drone attacks against Russian targets have been reported in Crimea The unconfirmed reports follow a string of attacks against Russian military sites and equipment in the annexed peninsula over the past week Unverified videos appear to show smoke rising from the area in Sevastopol where Russia's Black Sea fleet is based Meanwhile, Ukraineâs president says the safety of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant can start to be restored by a visit of international inspectors Voldymyr Zelensky was speaking after Vladimir Putin said UN officials would be granted permission to visit the site Moscow and Kyiv have blamed each other for shelling the complex, which is controlled by Russia, raising fears of a catastrophe Edited by Alex Therrien We're now closing our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. Thanks for joining us. Your writers today have been Catherine Evans, Nadeem Shad and Adam Durbin, and the page has been edited by Alex Therrien. We'll soon be bringing today's live coverage of the Ukraine war to a close. But before we do, here's a quick summary of the day's key developments: Crimea  Zaporizhzhia  Elsewhere As we've been reporting, the base of Russia's Black Sea fleet in Crimea has reportedly come under further drone attack. It follows a string of attacks on Russian targets in the peninsula, which was annexed from Ukraine in 2014, over the past week. Western officials have been talking about the impact the attacks are having in Moscow. In July, a drone strike derailed Navy Day celebrations in Sevastopol, according to Russian sources, and on 16 August thousands of Russian tourists witnessed an explosion at an arms depot on the peninsula. The fact that explosions in Crimea - a place previously considered to be well beyond the reach of any Ukrainian attack - was watched by so many, many of whom have since fled Crimea back into Russia, has been felt in the country's capital, according to officials speaking only on background.

Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo issued the warning during a phone call with Turkey's Deputy Finance Minister Yunus Elitas while the pair were discussing ongoing efforts to enforce sanctions, the Treasury Department says in a statement. The Russian-installed mayor of Ukraine's Mariupol, Kostyantyn Ivashchenko, has reportedly survived an assassination attempt on a visit to a zoo. In a Telegram post, Petro Andryushchenko, an aide to the former head of the city before Russia seized it, writes: ""There was an attempt on the life of gauleiter Ivashchenko in Mariupol. ""Unfortunately, it was not very successful. But this is only a beginning."" The Novosti Donbassa website quotes claims by a Russian state TV reporter that Ivashchenko was in a car when an explosive device went off at the entrance to the city's zoo. The BBC has not been able to verify this, but it has also been reported by Russian agency RIA Novosti, as well as a number of Telegram channels. At least three children and eight other people have been wounded by Russian shelling in Voznesensk, a town near Mykolaiv in southern Ukraine, local authorities have said. Two children are seriously hurt after the attack on a five-story residential building, with one needing eye surgery earlier, the local prosecutor's office has said. Prosecutors insisted that there are no military facilities in the area and said investigators are looking into the attack as a possible war crime. UN Secretary-General Guterres visited a port in Odesa, Ukraine, yesterday Earlier, UN
Secretary General Antonio Guterres held a press conference in Turkey afteranother two grain ships left Ukraine today. At the joint coordination centre in Istanbul, Turkey, Guterres said he had been ""deeply moved"" watching a ship carrying grain heading to the Horn of Africa during his visit to Ukraine. He said it was ""of enormous importance to humanity"", helping to provide ""urgently needed relief for those suffering from acute hunger"" around the world. The safe passage of the vesselshas been enabled through the UN-brokered deals with Turkey, Russia and Ukraine last month. Guterres added that enabling the transport of food and fertiliser from Russia is also critical as the cost of living crisis deepens. ""It is important that all governments and the private sector cooperate to bring them to market,"" he said. Read more Chris PartridgeBBC News The series of unexplained explosions in Russian-occupied Crimea has been surprising â not least because it is one of the areas most heavily defended from air attacks. Itâs believed Russian S-400 surface-to-air missile (SAM) units were deployed to the peninsula earlier this year. They are some of the most advanced in the world. While they defend against aircraft and larger missiles, the S-400s are protected by smaller SAMs like the Pantsir, delivering a two-layered defence system. Moscow has blamed sabotage for some of the Crimea incidents, indicating some kind of special military operation perhaps by Ukrainian forces â or those loyal to Kyiv. The airbase attack at Saky on 9 August wiped out at least eight Russian jets, including Su-30s and Su-24s assigned to the Black Sea fleet for protection. An AGM-88 being loaded on to US Air Force jet There is an additional factor to consider: the US decision to send AGM-88 high speed anti-radiation missiles (HARM) to Ukraine. The Ukrainian military has cleverly adapted some of their Russian-built fighter jets â Mig-29s - to accommodate missiles originally developed for western aircraft. Itâs not clear the level of integration - and Ukrainian pilots might not have the full functionality of the weapons system thatâs enjoyed by their American counterparts. But their role could be pivotal, as HARMs can destroy the radars of SAMs and early warning anti-air systems, effectively rendering them useless. This video can not be played Ukraine war: Billowing smoke after strike in Sevastopol More drone attacks against Russian targets have been reported in occupied Crimea. BBC News has not been able to independently verify the above footage, but it appears to show smoke rising from the area where Russia's Black Sea fleet is based in the city of Sevastopol. The Russian-installed leader of Sevastopol said that a Ukrainian drone had been shot down in the area, but that no one was hurt. It follows a string of attacks against military targets and equipment in the annexed peninsula over the past week. We've been reporting about the possibility of UN inspectors visiting the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant. Here's a recap of what's been happening at the site since the war began: Elsewhere in Ukraine, Russian forces attempted assaults in the Bakhmut and Avdiivka sectors in the Donbas region, Ukraine's General Staff reports in its morning update on Facebook. In the Kharkiv region, attempted Russian attacks near Borshchova were said to have been ""unsuccessful"". But the entire city of Melitopol in the Zaporizhzhia region heard ""powerful explosions"" last night, mayor Ivan Fedorov said on Telegram, adding that a Russian military base was reportedly hit. In the Kherson and Mykolayiv regions, Russian troops attempted an attack near Blahodatne and Partyzanske, Ukraine's Operational Command South reports on Facebook. The Ukrainian army repelled a Russian attack near Tavriyske, it said. Ukrainian aviation made 11 strikes on Russian positions, killing 17 Russian troops, the command added. This video can not be played Ukraine displays destroyed Russian tanks in Kyiv Ukraine has set up a 'parade' of destroyed Russian tanks and armour along a road in Kyiv often used for military processions. Up until Saturday the vehicles - most of which were destroyed in the first weeks of the war -  were set up outside the iconic St Michael's Monastery as a reminder of Russia's aggression. They were moved by cranes and lorries this morning to Khreshchatyk Street, in preparation for Ukraine's independence day on 24 August. Allow Twitter content?

Last year the road was the site of a large patriotic rally and military parade as a show of strength. This year it will instead be given over to the evidence of Ukraine's success at destroying Russian hardware. The appearance of the destroyed armoured vehicles has prompted much Ukrainian humour on social media. The running joke is that the Russians are finally staging a military parade in Kyiv, if not the one they likely had planned. Hugo BachegaReporting from Odesa The string of incidents against Russian targets in Crimea has fuelled speculation of Ukrainian involvement. Crimea was invaded and annexed by Russia in 2014, and Ukraine has vowed to retake it. Russia hasnât openly accused Ukraine of being behind the incidents. And Ukraine hasnât confirmed or denied involvement, although some officials have suggested Ukraine was responsible. If thatâs true, thereâs the obvious question: how did they do it? Was it the work of pro-Ukraine groups or individuals inside Crimea? Russia has built a heavy military presence since it occupied the peninsula. If thatâs the case, the fact several of its facilities have been attacked represents a massive security failure. Or was it the result of rocket attacks? Officially, Ukraine doesnât have weapons capable of striking so deep into Russian-controlled territory, away from the frontlines. Confirmation of this would indicate a still unknown capacity. Nevertheless, as Western officials say, these incidents are having major operational and psychological impact on Moscowâs forces. Smoke clouds following an explosion in Crimea on 16 August Here's a quick summary of the latest developments in Ukraine:  A Â£63m ($75m) Russian superyacht has been put up for auction after its oligarch owner was sanctioned by the UK, EU and US. The Axioma was seized by authorities in Gibraltar in March after US bank JP Morgan claimed owner Dmitrievich Pumpyansky failed to pay a Â£17m ($20m) loan. The 72.5m (238ft) vessel will go under the hammer in the British Overseas Territory's Admiralty Court on Tuesday. The Axioma is the first seized luxury boat to be sold since restrictions were imposed on powerful Russians following the invasion. It can sleep 12 people in six cabins with additional space for 20 crew, as well as containing a swimming pool, jacuzzi, spa, 3D cinema, jet skis and scuba diving equipment. Because it is listed for only one day, the boat is anticipated to sell for less than its estimated value. The money from the sale of Axioma is expected to go to JP Morgan. Pumpyansky, who has an estimated Â£1.84bn fortune, is the owner and chair of steel pipe manufacturer OAO TMK, a supplier to the Russian state-owned energy company Gazprom. Read more. James WaterhouseUkraine correspondent Crimea has firmly been in Russian control for eight years. Out of all the Ukrainian territory which Moscow has taken,
its grip has been tightest around this southern peninsula. So much so, Russian tourists have felt comfortable and
secure enough to use it as a regular holiday destination. That was until two weeks ago. The sight of two erupting ammunition depots and people
subsequently cutting their breaks short has been met with delight from Ukraine,
which has never accepted responsibility. Russian-installed officials have described the goal of
todayâs reported drone strikes as ânot a military one, but a psychological
oneâ. Even if it was coincidental that a âshot downâ drone
happened to land on the roof of Russiaâs Black Sea fleet headquarters, the
destabilising effect of Crimea being pulled into this conflict is undeniable. Local authorities both having to admit there were attacks,
as well as telling people to âstay calmâ, shows not all is well in their fortress
Crimea. Four Russian missiles have been shot down over eastern Ukraine, says the Ukrainian UNIAN news agency. According to the reports, which have been seen but not confirmed by the BBC, Ukrainian air defence forces intercepted four Russian Kalibr missiles over the eastern Dnipropetrovsk region. ""Cool start to Saturday [20 August] from our military,"" the head of the regional military administration, Valentyn Reznichenko, was quoted as saying. ""Our air defence shot down over Dnipropetrovsk region all four Kalibr missiles that the Russians aimed at the region. Glory to our military!"" The commander-in-chief of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, Valeriy Zaluzhnyy, reportedly said that four S-300 missiles were used to shoot down the Kalibr missiles, close to the city of Dnipro. Hugo Bachegareporting from Odesa AntÃ³nio Guterres, the UN Secretary General, told me there were two
priorities to reduce tensions around the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia complex. First, to create a demilitarised zone in the station, something
Russia has rejected, claiming it would make this complex more vulnerable.
Second, to allow international monitors into the complex. Today, it seems thereâs a window for that to happen. There are no
details of when and how such a mission will be carried out. The French
presidency says presidents Macron and Putin will talk again in the next few
days to discuss it. Russia appears to have dropped its demand that inspectors should
travel to the plant through Russian-controlled territory, something that had
been previously rejected by the Ukrainian government. Thereâs no guarantee yet that this a done deal. If a visit does
happen, it could mark a de-escalation of tensions that raised fears of a
catastrophe. File photo of the Russian missile cruiser Moskva, the flagship of the Black Sea Fleet, which was sunk in April. Earlier this week Russian state media reported that the Black Sea fleet's commander, Igor Osipov, had been replaced in light of recent attacks in Crimea. The RIA news agency said the fleet's new chief, Viktor Sokolov, had been introduced to military leaders at the port of Sevastopol. Moscow currently seems to be trying to re-arm its beleaguered fleet. State media reported that Admiral Sokolov told a group of young officers that they will receive 12 new vessels, alongside additional aviation and land-based vehicles later this year. He insisted that the fleet has been ""successfully completing all the tasks set for it"" during the invasion, Russia's Tass news agency reported. Chris PartridgeBBC News In other news, the United States has announced another tranche of weapons for Ukraine - this one totalling $775m. The package includes more High Speed Anti Radiation Missiles (HARMs) for attack on Russian surface-to-air missile radar systems, along with early warning radar facilities. The missiles are being integrated into existing Ukrainian aircraft - Mig-29s - not an easy task because they are Russian-built with very different avionics systems compared to Western jets. But war tends to accelerate development progress, so perhaps it is no surprise that this has been achieved by Ukraine. Ground-launched anti-armour capability gets a boost to Kyiv, too. For the first time, 1,500 TOW missiles - Tube-Launched, Optically Tracked, Wire-Guided missiles - are being supplied. The Pentagon has also committed to a steady flow of precision-guided munitions for HIMARS (High Mobility Artillery Rocket System) too. Further down the announcement is reference to ""demolition munitions"". These too have been supplied before in the shape of C-4, a malleable explosive thatâs been around for more than 60 years. With rumours of Ukrainian special operations responsible for at least some of the explosions at Russian-occupied military bases in Crimea, this is interesting. Russia has said sabotage was carried out, without offering any further explanation about what happened at the sites. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Jonah Hill says he has ""spent nearly 20 years experiencing anxiety attacks"" Jonah Hill has announced he will stop promoting his films to protect his mental health. The Superbad actor said he had suffered from anxiety attacks for 20 years, which were ""exacerbated by media appearances and public facing events"". He will not do any promotion for his new documentary, Stutz, which is about his relationship with a therapist. Psychologist Dr Sandra Wheatley told Radio 1 Newsbeat his decision was ""a really important message"". She said the fact that ""somebody who has so much to lose is actually prepared to step back"" should be applauded. Jonah, 38, opened up about his mental health inan open letter published by Deadline,externalahead of Stutz, which he directed and is about the therapist he began seeing in 2017. The film was shot in secret and follows the Hollywood star's journey with his therapist, while exploring mental health in general. ""I have come to the understanding that I have spent nearly 20 years experiencing anxiety attacks, which are exacerbated by media appearances and public facing events,"" he said in the letter. ""I am so grateful that the film will make its world premiere at a prestigious film festival... and I can't wait to share it with audiences around the world in the hope that it will help those struggling. ""However, you won't see me out there promoting this film, or any of my upcoming films, while I take this important step to protect myself."" The 21 Jump Street actor thanked people for their support Dr Wheatley, a chartered member of the British Psychological Society, told Newsbeat that when celebrities are on stage or at a film premiere they're still performing. ""But when they're offstage, they go back to who they really are,"" she said. ""So celebrities have to remember this persona in the media is an impersonation that you have, not you as an individual and that can be hard to balance."" Consultant psychologist Dr Elena Bailey agrees that celebrities are ""very vulnerable"" when they're in the public eye. Dr Bailey, who works at The Chelsea Psychology Clinic, said stepping away from the media was a ""self-protective behaviour"". ""This is because the type of attention and feedback and commentary on your life can have a very big impact on your mental health, causing a lot of anxiety, negative thoughts, symptoms of depression,"" she said. Tom Holland takes social media break for mental health Social media 'damages teens' mental health' Black Mirror actor quits Twitter for mental health Spiderman actor Tom Holland recently announced on Instagram he was taking a break from social media as he found it ""overwhelming"". And last year, actor Ryan Reynolds discussed how anxiety had an impact on his life and work. ""For those who are working in the media, social media becomes a job, it becomes self-promotion,"" Dr Wheatley said. ""The public would put something up on their social media pages and it's for a chosen audience, like friends or family. ""But for celebrities it's a very absent audience so they don't know how it's going to be received, which ultimately sets a very different objective and why their anxiety is heightened.""

"A bid to reduce the planned size of the Star of Caledonia has been lodged The size of a landmark sculpture designed to be built on the England-Scotland border could be smaller than planned under new proposals. The move would see the Â£7m Star of Caledonia reduced to about 80% of its original intended proportions. At 40m (130ft) the sculpture would have been twice as high as the Angel of the North at Gateshead. The scaled back design follows a change in disability access laws since the initial design was unveiled. It is hoped the project will attract 100,000 visitors a year to the area, generating Â£4m for the economy. The spiral structure, which would sit at the start of the M74 near Gretna Green, is yet to be built. It was first suggested as a way of helping the area to recover following the foot-and-mouth outbreak of 2001. The idea was to emulate the success enjoyed by the Angel of the North and a competition was launched to decide how it should look. The landmark would be clearly visible from the motorway across the Scotland-England border In 2011, a giant star - a collaboration between the late Charles Jencks and Cecil Balmond -was selected as the winning design for the scheme. However, with little funding in place it looked unlikely to go ahead when it missed out on Creative Scotland support three years later. Planning permission was extended to keep its hopes alive and fresh financial support was eventually secured. Backing from South of Scotland Enterprise was announced last yearwhich breathed new life into the scheme. It should help to unlock a funding package from renewable energy firm Community Windpower and the Borderlands Growth Deal to finally allow the project to go ahead. A bid for a non-material variation in its planning consent has been lodged for the scheme. It is now being proposed to reduce it in size by 20% which it is said can be achieved while still meeting the ""artistic aesthetic and visitor experience expectations"". The Gretna Landmark Trust also wants to construct a gravel pathway to the structure in order to ensure the project meets disabled access legislation. An application for a variation of planning permission said it would still provide a welcome to Scotland for drivers and rail users.

"Rail travel has been disrupted this week by industrial action, including an overtime ban which continues on Friday. Members of the train drivers' union Aslef walked out on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, prompting widespread cancellations. The six-day overtime ban, which started on Bank Holiday Monday and runs until Saturday, will continue to have an impact on some services. Drivers from 16 train operating companies staged walkouts on different days this week. The services affected included LNER, Northern Trains and TransPennine Express, c2c, Greater Anglia, Great Northern, Thameslink, Southeastern, Southern/Gatwick Express, South Western Railway main line and Island Line, Avanti West Coast, Chiltern Railways, CrossCountry, East Midlands Railway, Great Western Railway and West Midlands Trains. The overtime ban also means drivers have not been accepting any extra shifts, which they say are crucial to the smooth running of the rail network. National Rail said train timetables were likely to be affected. Passengers are advised tocheck before they travel.,external Rail passengers with advance tickets can get refunds if the train they are booked on is cancelled, delayed or rescheduled due to strikes.â¯â¯ If passengers have a return ticket they may also be entitled to a fee-free refund if part of the journey is cancelled. Season ticket holders (flexi, monthly or longer) who cannot travel, canclaim 100% compensation for strike dates,external. Aslef, the train drivers' union, is seeking better pay for its members. It says drivers are being asked to accept worse working conditions in exchange for a wage increase. Strike action began in July 2022 but no formal talks have taken place between the two sides since April 2023, when the most recent pay deal was rejected. The offer, described as ""risible"" by Aslef, included 4% pay rises two years in a row, on the condition drivers accepted changes to training and negotiated new work patterns. Train operators say ways of working need to change for wages to rise, because of the financial challenges they are facing and to ensure fairness to taxpayers. The body which negotiates on behalf of the rail companies, the Rail Delivery Group, says it continues to ""seek a fair agreement"". Unions need to re-ballot members every six months to see if they want to continue with industrial action. Currently, unions are obliged to give at least 14 days' notice of any strike action. In November last year, RMT members, including guards and ticket office staff,voted to accept a pay offer. This included a backdated pay rise of 5% for 2022-23 and job security guarantees. Talks over future pay deals and working practices will continue. A new law meanstrain companies can require enough staff to work on strike daysto run 40% of services. The Department for Transport said it expects employers to use minimum service levels ""if appropriate to do so, and to deliver the best possible service"". PM 'disappointed' as new rail strike law not used However, industry insiders told the BBC that applying the new rules was complicated. One source said it meant co-ordinating a reduced timetable with other operators in a short space of time. The Rail Delivery Group, a membership organisation of Britain's train operating companies, said the minimum services levels law was a potential tool but not a ""silver bullet"". Unions strongly oppose it. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) says median pay for ""train and tram drivers"" is just under Â£59,000. Train companies and the government say the offer rejected by Aslef would take average train driver pay to Â£65,000. The average salary of rail workers in 2022 was Â£45,919,according to the ONS.,external If drivers are excluded (because they tend to be members of the Aslef union, not RMT) its estimate is Â£39,518. However, the RMT union said that figure was too high because it does not include rail cleaning staff. Will you be affected by the strikes?

It follows a string of attacks on Russian targets in the peninsula, which was annexed from Ukraine in 2014, over the past week.

Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo issued the warning during a phone call with Turkey's Deputy Finance Minister Yunus Elitas while the pair were discussing ongoing efforts to enforce sanctions, the Treasury Department says in a statement. The Russian-installed mayor of Ukraine's Mariupol, Kostyantyn Ivashchenko, has reportedly survived an assassination attempt on a visit to a zoo. In a Telegram post, Petro Andryushchenko, an aide to the former head of the city before Russia seized it, writes: ""There was an attempt on the life of gauleiter Ivashchenko in Mariupol. ""Unfortunately, it was not very successful. But this is only a beginning."" The Novosti Donbassa website quotes claims by a Russian state TV reporter that Ivashchenko was in a car when an explosive device went off at the entrance to the city's zoo. The BBC has not been able to verify this, but it has also been reported by Russian agency RIA Novosti, as well as a number of Telegram channels. At least three children and eight other people have been wounded by Russian shelling in Voznesensk, a town near Mykolaiv in southern Ukraine, local authorities have said. Two children are seriously hurt after the attack on a five-story residential building, with one needing eye surgery earlier, the local prosecutor's office has said. Prosecutors insisted that there are no military facilities in the area and said investigators are looking into the attack as a possible war crime. UN Secretary-General Guterres visited a port in Odesa, Ukraine, yesterday Earlier, UN
Secretary General Antonio Guterres held a press conference in Turkey afteranother two grain ships left Ukraine today. At the joint coordination centre in Istanbul, Turkey, Guterres said he had been ""deeply moved"" watching a ship carrying grain heading to the Horn of Africa during his visit to Ukraine. He said it was ""of enormous importance to humanity"", helping to provide ""urgently needed relief for those suffering from acute hunger"" around the world.

Read more Chris PartridgeBBC News The series of unexplained explosions in Russian-occupied Crimea has been surprising â not least because it is one of the areas most heavily defended from air attacks. Itâs believed Russian S-400 surface-to-air missile (SAM) units were deployed to the peninsula earlier this year. They are some of the most advanced in the world. While they defend against aircraft and larger missiles, the S-400s are protected by smaller SAMs like the Pantsir, delivering a two-layered defence system. Moscow has blamed sabotage for some of the Crimea incidents, indicating some kind of special military operation perhaps by Ukrainian forces â or those loyal to Kyiv. The airbase attack at Saky on 9 August wiped out at least eight Russian jets, including Su-30s and Su-24s assigned to the Black Sea fleet for protection. An AGM-88 being loaded on to US Air Force jet There is an additional factor to consider: the US decision to send AGM-88 high speed anti-radiation missiles (HARM) to Ukraine. The Ukrainian military has cleverly adapted some of their Russian-built fighter jets â Mig-29s - to accommodate missiles originally developed for western aircraft. Itâs not clear the level of integration - and Ukrainian pilots might not have the full functionality of the weapons system thatâs enjoyed by their American counterparts. But their role could be pivotal, as HARMs can destroy the radars of SAMs and early warning anti-air systems, effectively rendering them useless.

BBC News has not been able to independently verify the above footage, but it appears to show smoke rising from the area where Russia's Black Sea fleet is based in the city of Sevastopol. The Russian-installed leader of Sevastopol said that a Ukrainian drone had been shot down in the area, but that no one was hurt.

The appearance of the destroyed armoured vehicles has prompted much Ukrainian humour on social media. The running joke is that the Russians are finally staging a military parade in Kyiv, if not the one they likely had planned. Hugo BachegaReporting from Odesa The string of incidents against Russian targets in Crimea has fuelled speculation of Ukrainian involvement. Crimea was invaded and annexed by Russia in 2014, and Ukraine has vowed to retake it. Russia hasnât openly accused Ukraine of being behind the incidents. And Ukraine hasnât confirmed or denied involvement, although some officials have suggested Ukraine was responsible. If thatâs true, thereâs the obvious question: how did they do it? Was it the work of pro-Ukraine groups or individuals inside Crimea? Russia has built a heavy military presence since it occupied the peninsula. If thatâs the case, the fact several of its facilities have been attacked represents a massive security failure. Or was it the result of rocket attacks? Officially, Ukraine doesnât have weapons capable of striking so deep into Russian-controlled territory, away from the frontlines. Confirmation of this would indicate a still unknown capacity. Nevertheless, as Western officials say, these incidents are having major operational and psychological impact on Moscowâs forces. Smoke clouds following an explosion in Crimea on 16 August Here's a quick summary of the latest developments in Ukraine:  A Â£63m ($75m) Russian superyacht has been put up for auction after its oligarch owner was sanctioned by the UK, EU and US. The Axioma was seized by authorities in Gibraltar in March after US bank JP Morgan claimed owner Dmitrievich Pumpyansky failed to pay a Â£17m ($20m) loan. The 72.5m (238ft) vessel will go under the hammer in the British Overseas Territory's Admiralty Court on Tuesday. The Axioma is the first seized luxury boat to be sold since restrictions were imposed on powerful Russians following the invasion. It can sleep 12 people in six cabins with additional space for 20 crew, as well as containing a swimming pool, jacuzzi, spa, 3D cinema, jet skis and scuba diving equipment. Because it is listed for only one day, the boat is anticipated to sell for less than its estimated value. The money from the sale of Axioma is expected to go to JP Morgan. Pumpyansky, who has an estimated Â£1.84bn fortune, is the owner and chair of steel pipe manufacturer OAO TMK, a supplier to the Russian state-owned energy company Gazprom. Read more. James WaterhouseUkraine correspondent Crimea has firmly been in Russian control for eight years. Out of all the Ukrainian territory which Moscow has taken,
its grip has been tightest around this southern peninsula. So much so, Russian tourists have felt comfortable and
secure enough to use it as a regular holiday destination. That was until two weeks ago. The sight of two erupting ammunition depots and people
subsequently cutting their breaks short has been met with delight from Ukraine,
which has never accepted responsibility. Russian-installed officials have described the goal of
todayâs reported drone strikes as ânot a military one, but a psychological
oneâ. Even if it was coincidental that a âshot downâ drone
happened to land on the roof of Russiaâs Black Sea fleet headquarters, the
destabilising effect of Crimea being pulled into this conflict is undeniable. Local authorities both having to admit there were attacks,
as well as telling people to âstay calmâ, shows not all is well in their fortress
Crimea. Four Russian missiles have been shot down over eastern Ukraine, says the Ukrainian UNIAN news agency. According to the reports, which have been seen but not confirmed by the BBC, Ukrainian air defence forces intercepted four Russian Kalibr missiles over the eastern Dnipropetrovsk region. ""Cool start to Saturday [20 August] from our military,"" the head of the regional military administration, Valentyn Reznichenko, was quoted as saying. ""Our air defence shot down over Dnipropetrovsk region all four Kalibr missiles that the Russians aimed at the region. Glory to our military!"" The commander-in-chief of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, Valeriy Zaluzhnyy, reportedly said that four S-300 missiles were used to shoot down the Kalibr missiles, close to the city of Dnipro. Hugo Bachegareporting from Odesa AntÃ³nio Guterres, the UN Secretary General, told me there were two
priorities to reduce tensions around the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia complex. First, to create a demilitarised zone in the station, something
Russia has rejected, claiming it would make this complex more vulnerable.
Second, to allow international monitors into the complex. Today, it seems thereâs a window for that to happen. There are no
details of when and how such a mission will be carried out. The French
presidency says presidents Macron and Putin will talk again in the next few
days to discuss it. Russia appears to have dropped its demand that inspectors should
travel to the plant through Russian-controlled territory, something that had
been previously rejected by the Ukrainian government. Thereâs no guarantee yet that this a done deal. If a visit does
happen, it could mark a de-escalation of tensions that raised fears of a
catastrophe. File photo of the Russian missile cruiser Moskva, the flagship of the Black Sea Fleet, which was sunk in April. Earlier this week Russian state media reported that the Black Sea fleet's commander, Igor Osipov, had been replaced in light of recent attacks in Crimea. The RIA news agency said the fleet's new chief, Viktor Sokolov, had been introduced to military leaders at the port of Sevastopol. Moscow currently seems to be trying to re-arm its beleaguered fleet. State media reported that Admiral Sokolov told a group of young officers that they will receive 12 new vessels, alongside additional aviation and land-based vehicles later this year. He insisted that the fleet has been ""successfully completing all the tasks set for it"" during the invasion, Russia's Tass news agency reported. Chris PartridgeBBC News In other news, the United States has announced another tranche of weapons for Ukraine - this one totalling $775m. The package includes more High Speed Anti Radiation Missiles (HARMs) for attack on Russian surface-to-air missile radar systems, along with early warning radar facilities. The missiles are being integrated into existing Ukrainian aircraft - Mig-29s - not an easy task because they are Russian-built with very different avionics systems compared to Western jets. But war tends to accelerate development progress, so perhaps it is no surprise that this has been achieved by Ukraine. Ground-launched anti-armour capability gets a boost to Kyiv, too. For the first time, 1,500 TOW missiles - Tube-Launched, Optically Tracked, Wire-Guided missiles - are being supplied. The Pentagon has also committed to a steady flow of precision-guided munitions for HIMARS (High Mobility Artillery Rocket System) too. Further down the announcement is reference to ""demolition munitions"". These too have been supplied before in the shape of C-4, a malleable explosive thatâs been around for more than 60 years. With rumours of Ukrainian special operations responsible for at least some of the explosions at Russian-occupied military bases in Crimea, this is interesting. Russia has said sabotage was carried out, without offering any further explanation about what happened at the sites. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Tougher rules for some workers planning strike action have been announced. The government said it would ensure key services like the NHS are protected, but unions plan legal action. Sometrade union members would be required to continue workingduring a strike, under the proposed law. This would be to ensure a ""minimum level of service"". It would apply to England, Scotland and Wales. The sectors covered are: The NHS Transport Education Fire and rescue Border security Nuclear decommissioning To meet minimum staffing levels - which are still to be announced - employers would be able to issue a ""work notice"" stating the workforce they need. Employees named on the work notice would lose their right to protection from unfair dismissal if they then went on strike. The proposals will not affect strikes happening now, as Parliament needs to approve the changes. While MPs have backed the plans -by 315 votes to 236 votes- they also need to clear the House of Lords. This will be tougher for the government as it has less support in the Lords. Unions have threatened legal action if the new law is passed, while Labour says it would repeal it if it wins the next election. Unions criticise strikes bill as unworkable The strikes taking place in February and March A few professions are already not allowed to strike. Police officers arebanned from taking strike action,external. Nurses have an agreement to only walk out if the wellbeing of patients is unaffected. What will nurses' strike mean for patients? A strike can only happen if a majority of union members agree via an organised vote -known as a ballot.,external There are strict rules,externalaround holding a vote. For example, it must be a postal ballot - where members vote on paper and return it in a prepaid envelope. If workers agree to strike, details must be given to the employer at least 14 days before it begins (unless the union and employer agree to seven days). If the rules aren't followed, a court could prevent a strike. Non-union members can also strike,,externalsays Crystal Boyde, an employment lawyer at Thrive Law. ""As long as the industrial action is lawful, non-union members are allowed to go on strike and remain protected from dismissal,"" she says. UK employees are protected from being sacked during the first 12 weeks of official industrial action. If they are sacked during this period, they can claim unfair dismissal. However, workerscan be dismissed after 12 weeks,externalif the employer has tried to settle the dispute. For example, if an employment adviser likeAcas has been brought in to help find a solution.,external The government has introduced a new law allowing businesses to use agency workers to fill in for striking workers. However, trade unions havemounted a legal challenge,external. Trade unions are organisations which help workers negotiate with employers. They often help employees ask for more pay, or better working conditions. Unions also represent members who have problems at work. If negotiations don't work, a trade union's members might support action such as a strike. Almost one in four UK workers (23%) were union members in 2021 - a total of 6.4 million people,according to government statistics.,external After peaking at 13.2 million in 1979, union membership has fallen significantly - although the rate of decline has slowed. In 2021, 50% of public sector workers - including people like teachers and health workers - were in a union, compared with 13% of private sector employees. Employees over 50 are most likely to be members. Members normally pay a subscription and can leave at any point. Workers on strike can expect to lose wages for the time they do not work. No-one can be forced to take part in a strike - so a worker can choose to work. Picket lines are common sights during strikes The Labour Party was created from the trade union movement in 1900. There are currently12 trade unions,externalaffiliated to the party, including two of the largest - Unison and Unite. Labour relies on unions for funding. During the last general election campaignLabour received a total of Â£5.4m,external- of which Â£5m came from trade union donations.

We'll soon be bringing today's live coverage of the Ukraine war to a close. But before we do, here's a quick summary of the day's key developments: Crimea  Zaporizhzhia  Elsewhere As we've been reporting, the base of Russia's Black Sea fleet in Crimea has reportedly come under further drone attack. It follows a string of attacks on Russian targets in the peninsula, which was annexed from Ukraine in 2014, over the past week. Western officials have been talking about the impact the attacks are having in Moscow. In July, a drone strike derailed Navy Day celebrations in Sevastopol, according to Russian sources, and on 16 August thousands of Russian tourists witnessed an explosion at an arms depot on the peninsula. The fact that explosions in Crimea - a place previously considered to be well beyond the reach of any Ukrainian attack - was watched by so many, many of whom have since fled Crimea back into Russia, has been felt in the country's capital, according to officials speaking only on background.

Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo issued the warning during a phone call with Turkey's Deputy Finance Minister Yunus Elitas while the pair were discussing ongoing efforts to enforce sanctions, the Treasury Department says in a statement. The Russian-installed mayor of Ukraine's Mariupol, Kostyantyn Ivashchenko, has reportedly survived an assassination attempt on a visit to a zoo. In a Telegram post, Petro Andryushchenko, an aide to the former head of the city before Russia seized it, writes: ""There was an attempt on the life of gauleiter Ivashchenko in Mariupol. ""Unfortunately, it was not very successful. But this is only a beginning."" The Novosti Donbassa website quotes claims by a Russian state TV reporter that Ivashchenko was in a car when an explosive device went off at the entrance to the city's zoo. The BBC has not been able to verify this, but it has also been reported by Russian agency RIA Novosti, as well as a number of Telegram channels. At least three children and eight other people have been wounded by Russian shelling in Voznesensk, a town near Mykolaiv in southern Ukraine, local authorities have said. Two children are seriously hurt after the attack on a five-story residential building, with one needing eye surgery earlier, the local prosecutor's office has said. Prosecutors insisted that there are no military facilities in the area and said investigators are looking into the attack as a possible war crime.

its grip has been tightest around this southern peninsula. So much so, Russian tourists have felt comfortable and
secure enough to use it as a regular holiday destination. That was until two weeks ago. The sight of two erupting ammunition depots and people
subsequently cutting their breaks short has been met with delight from Ukraine,
which has never accepted responsibility. Russian-installed officials have described the goal of
todayâs reported drone strikes as ânot a military one, but a psychological
oneâ. Even if it was coincidental that a âshot downâ drone
happened to land on the roof of Russiaâs Black Sea fleet headquarters, the
destabilising effect of Crimea being pulled into this conflict is undeniable. Local authorities both having to admit there were attacks,
as well as telling people to âstay calmâ, shows not all is well in their fortress
Crimea. Four Russian missiles have been shot down over eastern Ukraine, says the Ukrainian UNIAN news agency. According to the reports, which have been seen but not confirmed by the BBC, Ukrainian air defence forces intercepted four Russian Kalibr missiles over the eastern Dnipropetrovsk region. ""Cool start to Saturday [20 August] from our military,"" the head of the regional military administration, Valentyn Reznichenko, was quoted as saying. ""Our air defence shot down over Dnipropetrovsk region all four Kalibr missiles that the Russians aimed at the region. Glory to our military!"" The commander-in-chief of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, Valeriy Zaluzhnyy, reportedly said that four S-300 missiles were used to shoot down the Kalibr missiles, close to the city of Dnipro. Hugo Bachegareporting from Odesa AntÃ³nio Guterres, the UN Secretary General, told me there were two
priorities to reduce tensions around the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia complex. First, to create a demilitarised zone in the station, something
Russia has rejected, claiming it would make this complex more vulnerable.
Second, to allow international monitors into the complex. Today, it seems thereâs a window for that to happen. There are no
details of when and how such a mission will be carried out. The French
presidency says presidents Macron and Putin will talk again in the next few
days to discuss it. Russia appears to have dropped its demand that inspectors should
travel to the plant through Russian-controlled territory, something that had
been previously rejected by the Ukrainian government. Thereâs no guarantee yet that this a done deal. If a visit does
happen, it could mark a de-escalation of tensions that raised fears of a
catastrophe. File photo of the Russian missile cruiser Moskva, the flagship of the Black Sea Fleet, which was sunk in April. Earlier this week Russian state media reported that the Black Sea fleet's commander, Igor Osipov, had been replaced in light of recent attacks in Crimea. The RIA news agency said the fleet's new chief, Viktor Sokolov, had been introduced to military leaders at the port of Sevastopol. Moscow currently seems to be trying to re-arm its beleaguered fleet. State media reported that Admiral Sokolov told a group of young officers that they will receive 12 new vessels, alongside additional aviation and land-based vehicles later this year. He insisted that the fleet has been ""successfully completing all the tasks set for it"" during the invasion, Russia's Tass news agency reported. Chris PartridgeBBC News In other news, the United States has announced another tranche of weapons for Ukraine - this one totalling $775m. The package includes more High Speed Anti Radiation Missiles (HARMs) for attack on Russian surface-to-air missile radar systems, along with early warning radar facilities. The missiles are being integrated into existing Ukrainian aircraft - Mig-29s - not an easy task because they are Russian-built with very different avionics systems compared to Western jets. But war tends to accelerate development progress, so perhaps it is no surprise that this has been achieved by Ukraine. Ground-launched anti-armour capability gets a boost to Kyiv, too. For the first time, 1,500 TOW missiles - Tube-Launched, Optically Tracked, Wire-Guided missiles - are being supplied. The Pentagon has also committed to a steady flow of precision-guided munitions for HIMARS (High Mobility Artillery Rocket System) too. Further down the announcement is reference to ""demolition munitions"". These too have been supplied before in the shape of C-4, a malleable explosive thatâs been around for more than 60 years. With rumours of Ukrainian special operations responsible for at least some of the explosions at Russian-occupied military bases in Crimea, this is interesting. Russia has said sabotage was carried out, without offering any further explanation about what happened at the sites. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Rishi Sunak is trailing behind Liz Truss in the polls Michael Gove has said he will back Rishi Sunak to be the next Conservative Party leader, saying he has what the job requires. The ex-levelling up secretarywrote in The Times,externalrival Liz Truss's tax policies would put business executives before the poorest in society, calling the plans a ""holiday from reality"". He also said he himself did not expect to return to frontbench politics. It comes as Mr Sunak unveils plans he says will help British motorists. The former chancellor is battling it out with Foreign Secretary Ms Truss to replace outgoing Prime Minister Boris Johnson as the leader of the Tories. The result will be announced on 5 September. A number of cabinet members have publicly backed Ms Truss, who is also the bookmakers' favourite. What are the policies of final two hoping to be PM? How accurate are Tory leadership polls? What are policy flashpoints for the next PM? Mr Gove backed Kemi Badenoch earlier in the contest, but writing on Saturday he said he was now in favour of Mr Sunak, raising doubts over Ms Truss's plans to deal with soaring prices and living costs. He said: ""Proposed cuts to national insurance would favour the wealthy, and changes to corporation tax apply to big businesses, not small entrepreneurs. I cannot see how safeguarding the stock options of FTSE 100 executives should ever take precedence over supporting the poorest in our society, but at a time of want it cannot be the right priority."" He went on: ""And here I am deeply concerned that the framing of the leadership debate by many has been a holiday from reality. The answer to the cost-of-living crisis cannot be simply to reject further 'handouts' and cut tax."" Mr Gove said the tax hikes brought in by Mr Sunak as chancellor had been ""a consequence of Covid, not Rishi's inner preferences"". ""I know what the job requires. And Rishi has it,"" he said. Mr Gove added he did not plan to return to frontbench politics himself, writing: ""I do not expect to be in government again. But it was the privilege of my life to spend 11 years in the cabinet under three prime ministers."" Mr Gove missed out in his own leadership bids in 2016 and 2019 and was most recently sacked as Levelling Up Secretary after publicly telling Mr Johnson to quit as prime minister ahead of his ultimate resignation. The Sunak campaign welcomed Mr Gove's backing, with a spokeswoman saying: ""Delighted to have the support of a party and Cabinet veteran who has intellectual heft and shown the radical reforming zeal in every job he has had, that we now so desperately need."" Meanwhile, Mr Sunak promised to tackle the ""war on motorists"" if he became prime minister - describing smart motorways as ""unsafe"" and pledging to stop any new ones being built. He also said he would clamp down on rogue parking fines and review some of the neighbourhoods that have been designated as ""low traffic areas"" in recent years. Mr Sunak pledged to introduce a transition to electric vehicles without punishing drivers, while also delivering a ""rural rollout action plan"" to ensure countryside communities were not left behind. Liz Truss received criticism from Mr Gove over her plans to cut tax Ms Truss appears to be the frontrunner in the polls and has been backed by senior Conservatives colleagues including Nadhim Zahawi, ThÃ©rÃ¨se Coffey, Sajid Javid, Jacob Rees-Mogg, Nadine Dorries, along with former leadership candidates Suella Braverman and Tom Tugendhat. Mr Sunak was recently questioned during a recent Sky interview as to why he was unable to win the public support of close colleagues, other than his main backer, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps. The two leadership candidates appeared at a hustings in Manchester on Friday evening - answering questions in front of party members. Ms Truss spoke about her plan to lift the ban on new grammar schools, saying she wanted everyone ""right across the country"" to have the choice to enlist their children at one. She went on to criticise the Mayor of Greater Manchester, calling Andy Burnham the ""miserabilist mayor... who doesn't want opportunities"" for people in the city. Mr Sunak used the event to share his plans on rolling out private-sector style ""surgical hubs"" across the country in the NHS and he also criticised the UK's foreign policy.

"Vanessa Bryant arrives at the federal courthouse in Los Angeles on Friday Kobe Bryant's widow has testified that she had panic attacks after learning that photos of the helicopter crash that killed her husband and daughter were taken and shared. Vanessa Bryant is suing Los Angeles County after first responders allegedly circulated pictures from the accident. ""I expected them to have more compassion,"" she told jurors at her invasion of privacy trial. Mrs Bryant, 40, is seeking unspecified millions for her emotional distress. Her husband, basketball legend Kobe Bryant, 41, daughter Gianna, 13, and six family friends died when their helicopter crashed in California in January 2020. A report by the Los Angeles Times claiming county employees took photos at the crash site and shared them with others has enraged the victims' families. Last November, the county agreed to pay $2.5m (Â£2.1m) over the emotional distress caused to two families who lost relatives in the crash - but Mrs Bryant refused to settle. Her federal lawsuit was made alongside Chris Chester, who lost his wife Sarah and daughter Payton in the crash. Sobbing on the witness stand on Friday, Mrs Bryant recalled being at home with her other children when she read the LA Times story. ""I bolted out of the house and I ran to the side of the house so the girls couldn't see me. I wanted to runâ¦ down the block and just scream,"" she said. Mrs Bryant said she had felt ""blindsided, devastated, hurt and betrayed"" by news of the leak and ""[lives] in fear every day of... having these images pop up"" on social media. ""I don't ever want to see these photographs,"" she said. ""I want to remember my husband and my daughter the way they were."" LA officers took Kobe Bryant crash photos - sheriff Bryant widow sues LA police over 'graphic images' Kobe Bryant's wife first heard of his death online Jurors at the trial have heard how sheriff's deputies and firefighters took gruesome cell phone photos at the accident site and showed them to others, including at a bar and a gala event. These employees ""poured salt in an open wound and rubbed it in"" with their actions, Mrs Bryant's lawyer Luis Li said during opening statements last week. But a lawyer for the county pushed back, saying ""site photography is essential"" and that the photos had not been posted anywhere publicly. ""They're not online, they're not in the media, they've never even been seen by the plaintiffs themselves,"" J Mira Hashmall said. Mrs Bryant was the final witness for the prosecution and the defence will argue its case next.

"Opinion polls suggest Liz Truss is the favourite in the race to become the UK's next PM. Liz Truss has a large lead over Rishi Sunak in the race to become next Conservative leader and prime minister, in polls of party members. But who carries out these polls, and are they likely to be accurate? Although they are the only people who can vote in the contest, only three pollsters have been asking members what they think of the candidates. They are YouGov, Opinium, and Techne UK - the British arm of Italian public affairs firm Techne. ConservativeHome, a popular website among Tory activists, has also been conducting surveys about how members are likely to vote. Of the three polling companies, YouGov has carried out the most research about how party members are likely to vote. Itslatest survey,external, published in early August, gave Ms Truss a 38-point lead over her rival, when those not intending to vote and ""don't knows"" are excluded. An earlier poll, released the day after therun-off with Mr Sunakwas confirmed, put Ms Truss's advantage at 24 points, suggesting the foreign secretary's lead has widened as the contest has gone on. Earlier YouGov surveys of Tory members, conducted when more candidates were still in the race, also suggested she would win a run-off against Mr Sunak. The company's polls break down support by age, gender, and support for Brexit at the referendum in 2016. Notably, they have suggested Ms Truss's lead among Leave-voting Tory members is bigger - despite the fact that, unlike former chancellor Mr Sunak, she campaigned for Remain. Polls suggest Rishi Sunak is struggling to win over pro-Brexit members, despite campaigning to leave the EU. The website'slatest survey,external, published in mid-August, gives Ms Truss a 32-point lead once ""don't knows"" and those not intending to vote were divided evenly between the candidates. This mirrored the results of another survey the site released in early August - the only other one it has done since the contest narrowed to two. The website conducted several surveys earlier in the race, when more candidates made up the field, that also suggested Ms Truss would beat Mr Sunak in a straight head-to-head. Unlike the polling companies, ConservativeHome does not publish a breakdown of support by age, gender or other factors. Liz Truss: Fast-track career of foreign secretary Rishi Sunak: Former chancellor bidding for top job Opinium has released one poll of Tory members since the field narrowed to two. The results, published in mid-August, gave Ms Truss a 22-point lead. It also suggested around a third of members voted in the first week of August, when voting got under way and the company did its interviews. Techne UK caused a stir when some of its polling data, giving Ms Truss a more slender 5-point lead in the contest, appeared in the press in early August. Thedata,external, which appeared in the press, had been gathered as part of a wider study into what members think of the candidates' policies. The company is expected to publish fresh Tory member polling later in August. Some opinion polling has focused on the candidates' performance in TV debates. YouGov conducts its Tory membership polling online, from those volunteers in its database who say they are Tory party members. It typically surveys 800-900 members for its polls, with over 1,000 respondents for the most recent. A similar process is used by Opinium, which found 507 self-declared Tory members to interview from volunteers for online panels. Techne UK used its own specially created sample of 807 Tory members that it identified from online and telephone interviews. The polling companies adjust - or ""weight"" - the raw results in an attempt to ensure they reflect the characteristics of the party membership as a whole. Academic research has shown Conservative members tend to beolder, whiter and more middle classthan the rest of the population. ConservativeHome also conducts its surveys online. It has a panel of more than 3,300 Tory members, which it has been using to run monthly surveys about what party activists are thinking for more than 15 years. Its leadership surveys in the contest so far have also tended to have around 800-900 participants. Unlike the polling companies, however, it does not weight the results of its surveys. Truss's economic plan remains popular with members Why newspapers matter in race to be next PM Tracking the opinion of members of political parties is harder for pollsters than taking the temperature of the wider electorate. There are believed to be around 160,000 Tory members, representing 0.3% of the total UK electorate, meaning they are harder to poll. In addition, accurately weighting raw data is trickier because the party itself does not publish data on its membership. Backers of the two candidates have been able to show their support at events run by the party To date, there have only been three Tory leadership elections where members have voted since the current system was introduced (they didn't get to vote in the 2016 contest becauseAndrea Leadsom withdrew beforehand). This makes it hard to say whether member polling has been accurate historically, especially since polling was limited at first two such contests in 2001 and 2005. Moreover, of the four organisations polling Tory members in this contest, only YouGov and ConservativeHome have done it for previous races. At the last contest, in 2019, YouGov accurately predicted Boris Johnson's victory, albeit both the member polls it ran during the campaign gave him bigger leads than the 66.4% vote share he eventually received. ConservativeHome also predicted Mr Johnson would win, across three surveys during his head-to-head contest with Jeremy Hunt. As any pollster will tell you though, all polls are snapshots rather than predictions. The only number that really matters is the final result, which will be announced on by the party on 5 September.
