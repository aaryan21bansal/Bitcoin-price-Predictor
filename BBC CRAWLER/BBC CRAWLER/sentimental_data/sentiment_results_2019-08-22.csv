"Sophie Christiansen said current systems make her feel she constantly has to rely on someone to get around A gold medal winning Paralympian was left in tears after she became stuck on a train when there was no guard to help her off. Wheelchair user Sophie Christiansen, who has cerebral palsy, tweeted a video of her ordeal on her London to Godalming journey. The footage shows a passenger holding the train doors open for the dressage rider until an exit ramp is provided. South Western Railway (SWR) said it had apologised to Ms Christiansen.

The 31-year-old from Ascot said she was told SWR staff were aware she was travelling on the service but when she arrived at her stop there was no-one waiting with a ramp. ""It's always the general public helping me; I don't know what I'd do without them,"" she said. ""Without the help I probably would've ended up in Portsmouth at the end of the line because there is no real way for me to block the door to stop the train from moving."" Ms Christiansen said she ""went home and cried"" because of the repeated difficulties she faces over accessibility on trains. The OBE dressage rider is an eight-time Paralympic gold medallist She said she was stranded ""one in 10 times"" and called on the government to lobby rail companies to improve disabled access. Despite previously speaking to SWR's inclusion manager about introducing automated ramps to make travelling for disabled people smoother, Ms Christiansen claims manual ones are still in place. ""I literally don't know what it will take for the rail in this country to make the service more accessible,"" she said. ""There should be a different system to allow me to be independent"". The 31-year-old dressage rider wants automated ramps to make travelling smoother Andy Masters, head of services at disabled rights charityBack Up,external, said stories like Sophie's were ""all too common"". He said wheelchair users routinely needed to consider problems over access at stations and whether they would manage to find a guard to get them on and off trains. ""An easy journey is not a given, but being able to use public transport is essential to most people's daily lives. ""It allows us to go to work, socialise and get to where we need to be. Accessible stations allow disabled people to live the lives they want, just like everyone else.'' SWR said it was investigating the incident ""as a priority"" and it was reviewing the process ""to make sure this doesn't happen again"". Rail Delivery Group, which represents UK train operators, said it was working to bring ""thousands of new, more accessible carriages on track and speeding up the process for passengers booking assistance.""

"The model was burned at a bonfire party in south London on 3 November 2018 A man who filmed a cardboard effigy of Grenfell Tower being burned on a bonfire has been cleared of posting ""grossly offensive"" material. Prosecutors claimed footage recorded by Paul Bussetti at a London party was racist but the 47-year-old said it was a ""joke"" only shared between friends. He was found not guilty after it was revealed a second video from the party had also been shared on WhatsApp. Magistrates said they could not be sure the film was that taken by Mr Bussetti. The prosecution's handling of evidence in the case was described as ""appalling"" by Chief Magistrate Emma Arbuthnot. The clip of the cardboard building, which had ""Grenfell Tower"" written on it, was recorded at a party attended by about 30 people in south London on 3 November, Westminster Magistrates' Court heard. It was later uploaded to YouTube and sparked outrage, with a relative of one of the 72 people who died in the blaze on 14 June 2017 calling it ""revolting"". Paul Bussetti told the court he was not a racist Mr Bussetti, of South Norwood, was accused of sending ""grossly offensive"" material via a public communications network. He told magistrates the effigy had been created by his friend and the characters featured on the model were meant to represent ""the majority of people that were at the party"", not people who died in the disaster. One black-clad figure, who was referred to as ""ninja"", was meant to represent his friend's son who did martial arts, while his own image had been on the other side of the box, Mr Bussetti said. The father-of-two said he shared the footage with about 20 people on two WhatsApp groups but he had never intended it to go further. When prosecutor Philip Scott suggested he sent the footage because it was in keeping with other ""highly racist"" content he shared, Mr Bussetti replied that it was ""just banter"" and denied being racist. Just before Ms Arbuthnot left court to consider her verdict at the end of the two-day trial, defence barrister Mark Summers QC revealed he had just been made aware of evidence that a second video was recorded. He argued it meant there was ""absolutely no way"" to know which piece of footage had made its way onto YouTube and gone viral. Clearing Mr Bussetti, Ms Arbuthnot said she could not be sure the video used in the case was taken by him. She also said while it was ""in colossal bad taste"", she could not be certain the figures on the tower were not Mr Bussetti and his friends. The chief magistrate added she was ""appalled at the disclosure in this case"" with the last-minute evidence helping to avoid ""a potential miscarriage of justice"". A second charge of causing footage of a ""menacing character"" to be uploaded on YouTube against Mr Bussetti had earlier been dismissed.

"Google's move followed a similar clamp down by Twitter and Facebook earlier this week Google has shut down 210 channels on YouTube it said were part of a ""coordinatedâ attempt to post material about the ongoing protests in Hong Kong. The firm said attempts had been made,externalto ""disguise the origin of these accounts and other activity commonly associated with coordinated influence operationsâ. The search giant linked its move tosimilar action taken by Twitter and Facebook earlier this week. However, unlike those companies, Google stopped short of explicitly saying it believed the Chinese government had been behind the now-disabled accounts. Nor would it share further details on the nature or motivation of the material it had taken down from its platform. ""Earlier this week,â a statement read, ""as part of our ongoing efforts to combat coordinated influence operations, we disabled 210 channels on YouTube when we discovered channels in this network behaved in a coordinated manner while uploading videos related to the ongoing protests in Hong Kong. ""This discovery was consistent with recent observations and actions related to China announced by Facebook and Twitter.â The background you need on the Hong Kong protests Hong Kong: 'If we burn, they'll burn with us' Fake news is 'reinforced by false memories' A Google spokesperson would not comment when asked by the BBC whether Google agreed with Twitterâs assessment that it was a state-backed misinformation campaign, designed to undermine the protest movement in Hong Kong. This video can not be played How Hong Kong got trapped in a cycle of violence The company has not said whether it planned to prohibit advertising sales to state-controlled media organisations, such as the Chinese broadcaster, Xinhua. Twitter announced it would no longer allow ads from broadcasters who were financially and editorially controlled by governments, after facing severe criticism for allowing anti-Hong Kong ads to spread on the platform. _____ Follow Dave Leeon Twitter @DaveLeeBBC,external Do you have more information about this or any other technology story?You can reach Dave directly and securely through encrypted messaging app Signal on: +1 (628) 400-7370 LA mayor says winds and drought created 'perfect storm', while official hits out at looters What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

"Lizzie said one man ""moved his hand, quite forcefully, up my skirt"" Women working on shows at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe have reported facing sexual harassment on a daily basis while out promoting their performances, the BBC has been told. Some reported being groped, while others said lewd comments had left them feeling vulnerable. The actors' union Equity said it was receiving reports of ""more and more"" incidents each year. Police Scotland said it had not received any reports of harassment. It said it had an increased police presence. It is estimated that more than 30,000 male and female artists perform at the Fringe each year, across 3,500 shows. Lizzie - whose surname we are not using - said that the sexual harassment she received made her alter her behaviour to try to avoid unwanted attention, while continuing to promote her show. She told the Victoria Derbyshire programme that while handing out flyers, one man ""pretended to brush something off my thigh and then moved his hand, quite forcefully, up my skirt"". She said on another occasion she was ""cornered"" by three men, who appeared to be twice her age, who said they would ""only buy a ticket or take a flyer in exchange for my phone number"". On other occasions, men would make comments about her appearance or ""invade"" her personal space ""so their grope could go unnoticed"", she added. Lizzie said she wished handing out flyers was not necessary, but that it was by far the most effective means of selling tickets for lesser-known productions. Fi said she felt under pressure to ""laugh off"" harassment Most of the abuse is thought to take place on the Royal Mile - a busy street at the heart of the city. Fi said she had felt under pressure to ""laugh off"" any harassment she endured, such as having her bottom pinched, because she was ""trying to get customers"". And one woman, who did not wish to be named, said that while handing out flyers: ""A man stopped me on the street and started staring at me. When I asked him if he wanted a flyer he said, 'no, I just want to stare at you'."" Another woman said many like her felt pressured into putting up with the unacceptable behaviour of show reviewers - who can make a great difference in getting more people to watch their performances. She said: ""One reviewer would come up to me while I was flyering every day, being overly complimentary and holding a review over my head for the whole run of the Fringe. ""He made me feel really uncomfortable."" Performers and showgoers flock to Edinburgh throughout August Police Scotland said it had set up two mobile police stations for the duration of the month and had increased high-visibility patrols. It added that it had not received any complaints regarding sexual harassment. The actors' union, Equity, said many female performers had become accustomed to abuse - but it encouraged them to report all incidents to police. Its president, Maureen Beattie, said a ""slight level of hysteria"" at the Fringe ""seems to release this kind of underbelly of bad behaviour"". ""It is completely and utterly unacceptable. ""We are a workforce, and you must respect us,"" she added. Maureen Beattie said Equity had seen ""more and more"" reports of harassment each year ""Somebody recently had their bum grabbed, and that's supposed to be all right?"" she questioned. ""Would you do that to anyone else who was out on the street?"" Edinburgh Festival's Fringe Society, which supports the running of the month-long event, said: ""Everyone who is part of the Fringe - be they a performer, member of the crew, producer, audience member, critic and so on - has the right to feel safe and supported."" It added that it ""takes matters of this nature very seriously"" and urged those who experienced inappropriate behaviour to contact police.

"More waste could be sent to landfill in the UK after a no-deal Brexit, a major waste company has told the BBC. There are worries a no-deal outcome will disrupt the export of millions of tonnes of waste to facilities in the EU, so it will have to go to landfill. It would harm the environment and pile millions of pounds of extra costs onto councils, insiders say. The Environment Agency said it expected firms to find suitable solutions. ""We are encouraging businesses who export waste to consider and continue to plan alternative options in case of disruption at borders,"" a spokesperson for the government agency said. Internal documents outlining local councils' preparation for a no-deal Brexit, seen by the BBC and backed up by waste industry sources, suggest there is a high level of concern among local authorities around the issue of waste, with a significant number of councils rating the possibility of disruption as medium or high risk in their Brexit contingency planning. Meanwhile, the UK waste industry's trade body has warned a disruptive no-deal Brexit could mean rubbish from the more densely-populated South East being sent to landfill in northern England. Currently three million tonnes of UK domestic waste is exported to the EU annually for recycling or to be used as refuse-derived fuel. Southampton City Council, in an internal document prepared ahead of the previous Brexit deadline, said that port delays ""could result in recycling banks and waste transfer stations becoming full and potentially closing"". In that event recyclables might have to be diverted to landfill or to refuse-derived fuel stations, the document said. The main concern within industry is that the practice of sending black-binned household waste to Germany, the Netherlands or Scandinavia will either be physically prevented or delayed by port congestion following a no-deal Brexit. It could also become uneconomical because of a combination of further falls in the value of the pound and the imposition of World Trade Organization tariffs following a no-deal outcome. It is currently not clear whether the trade is classed as importing a service - waste processing - or exporting a good - a type of fuel. Suez, one of the market leaders in the sector, believes this is likely to lead to the UK falling short of current waste management targets. No-deal Brexit plan threatens UK fuel plants No-deal papers reveal council fears over food supply How have councils prepared for Brexit? ""In the various impacts we've looked at, as a result of a no-deal Brexit, we do know that there'll be some lowering of those environmental performance indicators that we are all trying to strive to achieve,"" Stuart Hayward-Higham, technical development director at Suez, told the BBC. ""One of the outcomes of a no-deal Brexit will mean that we will put more to landfill,"" he said. Whether it is due to congestion at ports or cost pressures on Suez's customers, Mr Hayward-Higham believes in the short to medium term it will be hard to find any alternatives. Stuart Hayward-Higham from waste firm Suez says in the short term more waste is likely to go to landfill if a no-deal Brexit disrupts the industry The situation is better than it was a year ago, however, as the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) has successfully negotiated the continuation of the trade in waste, with individual regulators in EU nations. In the no-deal preparation documents, councils also referred to several shorter-term risks to waste collection, arising from localised congestion and fuel supply problems, and listed some possible approaches to lower their impact. Some councils are stockpiling bin bags and wheelie bins. In one case even new bin lorries were fast-tracked to beat the March Brexit deadline. Braintree Council, for example, in April listed among its high risks the knock-on effect of transport and fuel problems and that it might have to ""consider reducing allocations of [bin] sacks per household to eke out supplies"". Sevenoaks Council suggests a park and ride could be used as a temporary site for waste. It said road congestion ""leading to late or no collections will impact on the community stockpiling waste in gardens or streets"". Milton Keynes council has asked waste sites whether they can accommodate increased amounts of waste. 10 ways no-deal Brexit could affect you Brexit: A really simple guide Jacob Hayler, who runs industry body the Environmental Services Association, told the BBC that councils' concerns were mainly reasonable worst-case scenarios that would materialise only in a more general crisis around transport congestion and fuel issues. He added that the government deserved credit for guaranteeing the ongoing legal framework, enabling waste exports to continue. However, Mr Hayler said waste was difficult to store ""so you can't have it all just piling up at the docks"". A more sustainable solution such as building more domestic ""energy from waste"" plants would take too long he said, leaving landfill as the only option. He suggested that mothballed landfill sites, mainly in the north of England, could be required to take up the slack instead. The most waste is created by big population centres in the South East, with very little landfill capacity available there. Therefore less densely parts of the country might be needed to accept overflow. ""It would have to start being trucked from the ports up to those landfill spaces further up north and stuck in a hole in the ground. And that's something that we would really like to avoid,"" Mr Hayler said. Jacob Hayler representing the waste industry says northern landfill sites might be required to take waste from southern England The government has said it will respect the new stringent EU ""Circular Economy Package"" limit of 10% of household waste going to landfill by 2035, even after Brexit. Currently around 20% is sent to landfill, having fallen from 80% in 2001, mainly as a result of the UK application of EU regulations on landfill and recycling. The Environment Agency said that it had worked with industry to assess the availability of landfill sites that could accept waste that would have been exported. Even if disruption were to occur waste exporters would be expected to make contingency plans that meant they met the high environmental standards that are the conditions of their permits and licences, it said. ""Even in a no deal situation, we will continue to expect all waste operators to adhere to the conditions of their permits and will not hesitate to take appropriate action otherwise,"" an agency spokesperson said.

"Thousand of Ryanair flights were cancelled or delayed due to strikes last summer Ryanair has come bottom in an annual Which? survey rating the customer services of 100 popular UK brands. The budget airline achieved a customer satisfaction score of only 45% for 2019. It is the sixth year in a row that Ryanair has come last.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the ""acute emergency"" belonged on the agenda, agreeing with French President Emmanuel Macron's earlier rallying cry. ""Our house is burning,"" he tweeted. Environmental groups say the fires are linked to Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro's policies, which he denies. Mr Bolsonaro has also accused Mr Macron of meddling for ""political gain"". He said calls to discuss the fires at the G7 summit in Biarritz, France, which Brazil is not participating in, evoke ""a misplaced colonialist mindset"". The largest rainforest in the world, the Amazon is a vital carbon store that slows down the pace of global warming. It is also home to about three million species of plants and animals, and one million indigenous people. In graphics: How bad are the Amazon fires? 'Football pitch' of Amazon forest lost every minute Satellite data published by the National Institute for Space Research (Inpe) has shownan increase of 85% this year in fires across Brazil,external, most of them in the Amazon region. It is the highest number of fires in Brazil since 2010. Conservationists say Mr Bolsonaro has encouraged loggers and farmers to clear the land. Mr Bolsonaro has suggested that non-governmental organisations (NGOs) started the fires, but admitted he had no evidence for this claim. In comments on Thursday, he acknowledged that farmers might be involved in setting fires in the region, according to Reuters news agency. Environmental groups have called for protests in cities across Brazil on Friday to demand action to combat the fires. Mr Macron, who will host the G7 summit of leading industrial nations at the weekend, warned that the health of the Amazon was a matter of international concern. ""Our house is burning. Literally. The Amazon - the lungs which produce 20% of our planet's oxygen - is on fire,""Mr Macron tweeted,external, using the hashtag #ActForTheAmazon. ""It is an international crisis. Members of the G7 summit, let's discuss this emergency."" This video can not be played One campaigner called the forest fires a ""vicious cycle"" Mrs Merkel described the fires as ""shocking and threatening"" and said she was convinced the issue should be on the G7's agenda, her spokesman said. Mr Bolsonaro responded by accusing the French president of using a Brazilian domestic issue for ""personal political gain"". Smoke from fires burning in the Amazon can be seen from space ""The French president's suggestion that Amazonian issues be discussed at the G7 without the participation of the countries of the region evokes a misplaced colonialist mindset, which does not belong in the 21st Century,"" he wrote on social media. Brazil wildfires prompt 'prayers' for the Amazon rainforest Is the honeymoon period over for Brazil's Bolsonaro? UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has also said he is ""deeply concerned"" about the fires in the Amazon. ""In the midst of the global climate crisis, we cannot afford more damage to a major source of oxygen and biodiversity. The Amazon must be protected,"" he tweeted. Analysis by Daniel Gallas, BBC News, Sao Paulo Brazilian presidents shrugging off international concern about the Amazon is nothing new. Others before Mr Bolsonaro have dismissed international NGOs and European leaders as foreign meddlers into national affairs. But Mr Bolsonaro has taken this to a new level by suggesting NGOs may be responsible for encouraging wildfires to sabotage him. His words may shock some international audiences, but they ring true to his supporters at home, where he remains a popular leader. Surprisingly the one reproving voice that could influence this debate is that of Brazilian farmers. One would think that they would support policies to promote more farming in the Amazon. But some agricultural leaders fear Mr Bolsonaro's poor handling of Brazil's image abroad could hurt exports of soybeans and beef. Some farmers have already urged a change of tone from the government. These are voices the president may be open to hearing. Mr Bolsonaro has said that the country is not equipped to fight the fires. ""The Amazon is bigger than Europe, how will you fight criminal fires in such an area?"" he asked reporters as he left the presidential residence on Thursday. ""We do not have the resources for that."" The Amazon rainforest covers an estimated 5.5m sq km (2,100,000 sq mi), about half the size of Europe. During his campaign, Mr Bolsonaro pledged to limit fines for damaging the rainforest and to weaken the influence of the environmental agency. He also suggested that Brazil could pull out of the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change, saying its requirements compromise Brazil's sovereignty over the Amazon region. This video can not be played President Bolsonaro accuses NGOs of starting Amazon wildfires Recently he has suggested that NGOs may have started fires as revenge for his government slashing their funding. Asked on Thursday who was responsible, he said: ""The Indians, do you want me to blame the Indians? Do you want me to blame the Martians?... Everyone is a suspect, but the biggest suspects are NGOs."" When asked if there was any proof of this, he replied: ""Did I accuse NGOs directly? I just said I suspect them."" Mr Bolsonaro has further angered those concerned over the spike in fires by brushing off the latest data. He argued that it was the season of the ""queimada"", when farmers burn land to clear it before planting. However, Inpe has noted that the number of fires is not in line with those normally reported during the dry season. It is not the first time that Mr Bolsonaro has cast doubt on figures suggesting that the Amazon is deteriorating rapidly. Last month,he accused Inpe's director of lying about the scale of deforestationthere. It came after Inpe published data showing an 88% increase in deforestation in the Amazon in June compared with the same month a year ago. The director of the agency laterannounced that he was being sacked amid the row. Climate activists and conservationists have been scathing about the Bolsonaro government and its policies, which favour development over conservation. They say that since President Bolsonaro took office, the Amazon rainforest has suffered losses at an accelerated rate. Their anger was further fuelled by satellite data showing a steep rise in fires in the Amazon region this year. Environmental group Greenpeace said Mr Bolsonaro's encouragement to farmers to clear swathes of rainforest led to two days of deliberate blazes nearly two weeks ago which are now out of control. Forest campaigner Juman Kubba told the BBC that world powers had to stop trade deals involving countries in the Amazon region until the rainforest was protected.

"This video can not be played President Bolsonaro responds to criticism about his previous comments on the Amazon fires Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has said his government lacks the resources to fight the thousands of fires in the Amazon. And he again suggested that non-governmental organisations had started fires in the rainforest, but admitted he had no evidence for this claim. He added that his government was investigating the fires. Earlier, Brazil's Environment Minister Ricardo Salles was heckled at a meeting on climate change.

The conference, organised by the United Nations, aims to promote action on climate change in the region. It is being attended by representatives from non-governmental organisations, businesses and educational organisations, among others. Climate activists and conservationists have been scathing about the Bolsonaro government and its policies, which favour development over conservation. They say that since President Bolsonaro took office, the Amazon rainforest has suffered losses at an accelerated rate. Their anger was further fuelled by satellite data showing a steep rise in fires in the Amazon region this year. The figures suggest there have been more than 75,000 fires so far this year for the whole of Brazil, compared with just over 40,000 over the same period in 2018. It is the highest number of fires in Brazil since 2010. The figures and satellite images showing most of the state of Roraima, in northern Brazil, covered by smoke have shocked many Brazilians andtriggered a global Twitter trend under the hashtag #prayforamazonia. The US space agency, Nasa, has on the other hand said that overall fire activity in the Amazon basin is slightly below average this year. The region is home to about three million species of plants and animals, and one million indigenous people. BBC UGC and Social News team The plight of the Amazon has seen millions take to social media to decry reports of a massive yearly increase in forest fires. But some of the most striking - and viral - pictures shared by social media users are not all they seem. The hashtag #PrayForAmazonia started to be widely used on Tuesday. It has been included in almost three million tweets since. The most widely shared tweet using that hashtag - with more than a million likes and retweets - includes two aerial images of forest fires, neither of which show the current situation.

"More waste could be sent to landfill in the UK after a no-deal Brexit, a major waste company has told the BBC. There are worries a no-deal outcome will disrupt the export of millions of tonnes of waste to facilities in the EU, so it will have to go to landfill. It would harm the environment and pile millions of pounds of extra costs onto councils, insiders say. The Environment Agency said it expected firms to find suitable solutions. ""We are encouraging businesses who export waste to consider and continue to plan alternative options in case of disruption at borders,"" a spokesperson for the government agency said. Internal documents outlining local councils' preparation for a no-deal Brexit, seen by the BBC and backed up by waste industry sources, suggest there is a high level of concern among local authorities around the issue of waste, with a significant number of councils rating the possibility of disruption as medium or high risk in their Brexit contingency planning. Meanwhile, the UK waste industry's trade body has warned a disruptive no-deal Brexit could mean rubbish from the more densely-populated South East being sent to landfill in northern England. Currently three million tonnes of UK domestic waste is exported to the EU annually for recycling or to be used as refuse-derived fuel. Southampton City Council, in an internal document prepared ahead of the previous Brexit deadline, said that port delays ""could result in recycling banks and waste transfer stations becoming full and potentially closing"". In that event recyclables might have to be diverted to landfill or to refuse-derived fuel stations, the document said. The main concern within industry is that the practice of sending black-binned household waste to Germany, the Netherlands or Scandinavia will either be physically prevented or delayed by port congestion following a no-deal Brexit. It could also become uneconomical because of a combination of further falls in the value of the pound and the imposition of World Trade Organization tariffs following a no-deal outcome. It is currently not clear whether the trade is classed as importing a service - waste processing - or exporting a good - a type of fuel. Suez, one of the market leaders in the sector, believes this is likely to lead to the UK falling short of current waste management targets. No-deal Brexit plan threatens UK fuel plants No-deal papers reveal council fears over food supply How have councils prepared for Brexit? ""In the various impacts we've looked at, as a result of a no-deal Brexit, we do know that there'll be some lowering of those environmental performance indicators that we are all trying to strive to achieve,"" Stuart Hayward-Higham, technical development director at Suez, told the BBC. ""One of the outcomes of a no-deal Brexit will mean that we will put more to landfill,"" he said. Whether it is due to congestion at ports or cost pressures on Suez's customers, Mr Hayward-Higham believes in the short to medium term it will be hard to find any alternatives. Stuart Hayward-Higham from waste firm Suez says in the short term more waste is likely to go to landfill if a no-deal Brexit disrupts the industry The situation is better than it was a year ago, however, as the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) has successfully negotiated the continuation of the trade in waste, with individual regulators in EU nations. In the no-deal preparation documents, councils also referred to several shorter-term risks to waste collection, arising from localised congestion and fuel supply problems, and listed some possible approaches to lower their impact. Some councils are stockpiling bin bags and wheelie bins. In one case even new bin lorries were fast-tracked to beat the March Brexit deadline. Braintree Council, for example, in April listed among its high risks the knock-on effect of transport and fuel problems and that it might have to ""consider reducing allocations of [bin] sacks per household to eke out supplies"". Sevenoaks Council suggests a park and ride could be used as a temporary site for waste. It said road congestion ""leading to late or no collections will impact on the community stockpiling waste in gardens or streets"". Milton Keynes council has asked waste sites whether they can accommodate increased amounts of waste. 10 ways no-deal Brexit could affect you Brexit: A really simple guide Jacob Hayler, who runs industry body the Environmental Services Association, told the BBC that councils' concerns were mainly reasonable worst-case scenarios that would materialise only in a more general crisis around transport congestion and fuel issues. He added that the government deserved credit for guaranteeing the ongoing legal framework, enabling waste exports to continue. However, Mr Hayler said waste was difficult to store ""so you can't have it all just piling up at the docks"". A more sustainable solution such as building more domestic ""energy from waste"" plants would take too long he said, leaving landfill as the only option. He suggested that mothballed landfill sites, mainly in the north of England, could be required to take up the slack instead. The most waste is created by big population centres in the South East, with very little landfill capacity available there. Therefore less densely parts of the country might be needed to accept overflow. ""It would have to start being trucked from the ports up to those landfill spaces further up north and stuck in a hole in the ground. And that's something that we would really like to avoid,"" Mr Hayler said. Jacob Hayler representing the waste industry says northern landfill sites might be required to take waste from southern England The government has said it will respect the new stringent EU ""Circular Economy Package"" limit of 10% of household waste going to landfill by 2035, even after Brexit. Currently around 20% is sent to landfill, having fallen from 80% in 2001, mainly as a result of the UK application of EU regulations on landfill and recycling. The Environment Agency said that it had worked with industry to assess the availability of landfill sites that could accept waste that would have been exported. Even if disruption were to occur waste exporters would be expected to make contingency plans that meant they met the high environmental standards that are the conditions of their permits and licences, it said. ""Even in a no deal situation, we will continue to expect all waste operators to adhere to the conditions of their permits and will not hesitate to take appropriate action otherwise,"" an agency spokesperson said.

"Jane Lax appeared as an audience member on Question Time in May A Tory activist has been suspended by the party after she joked about Nicola Sturgeon's miscarriage on Twitter. Jane Lax asked ""Is that when she dropped a book?"" in response to another Twitter user's claim that the first minister's miscarriage was ""fictional"". Mrs Lax, who was treasurer of the Moray Conservative Association, then posted three laughing emojis. A Scottish Conservative spokesman said the comments were ""completely unacceptable"". He added: ""As a result, Jane Lax has been suspended by the party pending a disciplinary procedure and has resigned as treasurer of the Moray association. ""Mrs Lax recognises she made a mistake and is extremely apologetic."" Mrs Lax, who is said to have been a member of the Moray association for two years, tweeted under the user name ""Jane - SNP don't speak for me"". She has now made her account private. Screenshots of Ms Lax's tweets have been shared on social media Ms Sturgeonrevealed in 2016that she had suffered a miscarriage five years earlier, while she was deputy first minister. The first minister, who is married to SNP chief executive Peter Murrell, was in the early stages of her pregnancy and preparing to share the news when she lost her baby. Ms Sturgeon spoke publicly about the miscarriage ahead of details being published - with her blessing - in a book by journalist Mandy Rhodes. She said she hoped allowing the details to be made public would challenge assumptions about women who do not have children. Speaking at an event at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe earlier this week, Ms Sturgeon described the ""horrible, misogynist, really filthy, disgusting"" abuse she receives online. She also warned that social media was distorting political debate in Scotland and across the world.

"Problems relating to overcrowding include two prisoners being placed in what should be single-occupancy cells The chief inspector of prisons has said she is ""very concerned"" that the number of inmates in Scotland is starting to exceed capacity. The prison population rose by 709 in the year to the end of March, from 7,413 to 8,122. Wendy Sinclair-Gieben, HM Chief Inspector of Prisons for Scotland, said this 9% increase is equivalent to one additional large prison. She warned the rise in inmates is putting extra pressure on the system. In her report for 2018/19, Ms Sinclair-Gieben said planned investment in key infrastructure must not be delayed. Barlinnie prison operating at more than 40% over capacity Scottish prisoners forced to double-up in cells Plans to restrict 12-month prison sentences published She also called for urgent action to replace HMPs Barlinnie, Greenock and Inverness, saying Victorian prisons are ""costly and no longer fit-for-purpose"". Ms Sinclair-Gieben said: ""The additional number of prisoners and an increasingly complex population places a heavy burden on an already overstretched prison service in Scotland. ""I am very concerned that the number of prisoners is starting to exceed design capacity, resulting in not only additional pressures on staff, the prison regime and activities, but also on the essential programme and through-care activities designed to reduce recidivism."" The increasing prison population has led to officers complaining of extra pressure being put on them Scotland's incarceration rate is one of the highest in Europe. The number of prisoners on remand awaiting trial has also risen from 1,142 last year (15.4% of the prison population) to 1,350 (16.6%) by 31 March this year. The report said problems relating to overcrowding include: Staff having less time to deal with individuals Two people sharing cells that have been designed for single occupancy Prisoners being located further away from home And an ""inevitable increase"" in the waiting list for offender behaviour programmes. The ""sharp rise"" in prisoners has been linked to factors including longer sentences for the most serious of crimes, a rise in the number of people being convicted of sexual offences, and more serious and organised crime being successfully prosecuted. Other factors include the reduction of prisoners being released on home detention curfew and very few prisoners subject to an order for lifelong restriction achieving parole. The report said these factors are likely to continue to place pressure on the size of the prison population for some time to come. The Scottish Prison Service is obliged to pay for places at privately-run HMP Kilmarnock Ms Sinclair-Gieben welcomedthe Scottish government's plans to extend the presumption against short prison sentencesfrom the current three months to 12. But she said she remains concerned it ""may not be enough to bring the prison population back in line with design capacity"". The report also found the Scottish Prison Service (SPS) is currently facing ""immense"" financial pressures, with the SPS being obliged to purchase places in the two privately-run prisons in Scotland, HMP Addiewell and HMP Kilmarnock. Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Prisons for Scotland carried out four full prison inspections, two return visit inspections, five court custody unit (CCU) inspections and two thematic reviews over the year. Inspectors noted problems with overcrowding and difficulties with access for people with mobility issues in some CCUs. They suggested some of the issues could be addressed through greater use of video-link court appearances. An SPS spokeswoman welcomed the report and said the service ""can take pride in how our prisons are run"". She added: ""SPS also welcomes HMCIPS's findings that staff and those in our care feel safe, and that they found the relationships and interactions between staff and prisoners to be positive and built on mutual respect. ""We continue to develop the regime for prisoners to maximise the range of purposeful activities available to them such as work, education and offender programmes to address their offending behaviour.""

"Allison Williams has been on sick leave since June The head of a health board at the centre of failings in maternity care at two hospitals has resigned following calls for her to consider her future. Cwm Taf health board said Allison Williams stepped down as chief executive on Tuesday. In June it was revealed shewas on sick leave. It follows a damningindependent reviewthat described maternity services at Royal Glamorgan and Prince Charles hospitals as ""dysfunctional"". Reacting to the news, a Tory AM said it would be ""inappropriate"" for Ms Williams to receive a pay-off. Health Minister Vaughan Gething put Cwm Taf maternity services into special measures following the review in April and an independent panel was put in place to oversee changes at the hospitals in Llantrisant and Merthyr Tydfil. This video can not be played 'We picked the wrong day to be ill' The review by experts from two royal colleges was prompted by 25 serious incidents, including eight stillbirths and four neonatal deaths, between January 2016 and last September. Concerns emerged in late 2018 that women and babies may have come to harm because of staff shortages and failures to report serious incidents. Mothers who came forward said they were ignored or made to feel worthless. Q&A: Cwm Taf maternity problems 'No confidence' in maternity bosses Mums 'ignored and made to feel worthless' At the time Ms Williams said some of their accounts were ""nothing short of heartbreaking"" and the health board accepted the review's findings. Councillor Andrew Morgan said he wrote to the health board with concerns in January But the leader of Rhondda Cynon Taf council, Councillor Andrew Morgan, said he had lost confidence in the health board months before the review and called for a change of management. He said at the time: ""It's still unclear who knew what and when but I still don't think the full picture has been revealed by the health board and for that reason I don't have confidence in the health board."" Speaking on Thursday about Ms Williams' resignation, Mr Morgan said it was ""the right decision"". ""Having spoken with patients and grieving families involved, and in light of the serious and unacceptable failings... I believe that it is in everyone's best interest that the CEO [chief executive officer] is replaced,"" he said. ""The tragic consequences of the systematic failings of this health board can never be allowed to happen again."" Prince Charles Hospital now has an expanded special care baby unit and six en-suite delivery rooms Tory AM for South Wales Central Andrew RT Davies said her resignation was ""no surprise given the recent scandal"", adding: ""Given the circumstances it would be inappropriate for any pay-off to have been agreed whilst the various inquiries are ongoing."" Labour AM for Pontypridd Mick Antoniw said the resignation was ""the appropriate course of action"". Plaid Cymru AM for Mid and West Wales Helen Mary Jones said she was ""glad to hear"" of the resignation and Ms Williams ""must be held accountable for her failures"". She added: ""Many of the families affected will feel that Ms Williams should have been held accountable and I share that view."" Rhondda Labour MP Chris Bryant said: ""I think she clearly made mistakes, she didn't keep the board fully informed and that included representatives from the local authority. ""My main interest at the moment is to try and make sure the maternity service that every single would-be mum gets is absolutely top quality. We have got lots of challenges,"" he toldBBC Radio Wales' Mai Davies. Since March, the more complex maternity cases - overseen by consultants - have all gone to Merthyr. Facilities here include a special-care baby unit. Health board chairman Prof Marcus Longley thanked Ms Williams for her dedication to the organisation. He added: ""She has played a key role in securing university status for the organisation [and] has a demonstrable track record of strong engagement of clinicians, staff, trade unions and partners; and delivery of significant change that has led to the transformation of services and the NHS estate in the area.""

"Qandeel Baloch was killed in July 2016 The parents of a Pakistani social media star allegedly murdered by her brothers have lost their bid to free their sons. Qandeel Baloch's parents told the court they forgave Waseem and Aslam Shaheen, who are on trial for the apparent honour killing. Ms Baloch, 26, was strangled in July 2016, in a murder that shocked Pakistan and the wider world. Her brother Waseem initially confessed, saying she had brought shame on his family, but later changed his plea. Another six men have been arrested in connection with the killing, while a seventh - believed to be another brother - has absconded. Qandeel Balochâs parents speak of pain Pakistani women and 'digital hate' Cases of women being killed for ""dishonouring"" their family are commonplace in Pakistan. Nearly 1,100 women were killed by relatives in so-called honour killings in 2015, according to the independent Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP). Many more cases go unreported. A loophole in the law used to allow perpetrators to avoid punishment because they could seek forgiveness from another family member. But in the wake of Ms Baloch's death - and the discussion it prompted - that loophole was closed. However, Ms Baloch's parents argued that because the change happened after her killing, they should still be able to pardon their sons. Her father, Muhammad Azeem, had originally said he wanted her killers ""to get death"", telling BBC Urdu that his son Waseem should be ""shot on sight"". But on Thursday he told the court in Multan, Punjab, that he and his wife had now decided to pardon their sons - but not the other accused -  ""in the name of Allah"", according to BBC Urdu. The court rejected the plea, entered on Wednesday, saying the case against the two men would continue as planned. This video can not be played The model and the mullah Ms Baloch has been dubbed the Kim Kardashian of Pakistan. She had hundreds of thousands of followers on social media, and was reportedly one of the top 10 most searched Pakistani personalities in the year before she died. She won praise for her fearlessness, for breaking strict social taboos and expressing herself the way she wanted to - even if that meant sharing risquÃ© photographs, or twerking on camera. But this fearlessness also won her enemies and put her in danger in a country that struggles with what it regards as immodest or ""badly behaved"" women. This video can not be played Qandeel Baloch had a reputation for being Pakistan's first social media celebrity Her background alone was enough to shock socially conservative Pakistan. Ms Baloch was born Fouzia Azeem, and came from a poor family in a town about 400km (248 miles) south west of Lahore. After her rise to fame in 2014, it emerged she had been married as a teenager, and had a baby. But her husband, she said later, was a ""savage man"" who abused her, and she fled with her son.

"Amari Smith claimed he was acting in self-defence when he stabbed a fellow teenager to death A teenager has been found guilty of killing a 17-year-old boy after a row over comments made on Facebook. Amari Smith, 18, stabbed Louis-Ryan Menezes once in the chest with a ""hunting-style knife"" in Northampton in May 2018, a court heard. Smith, of Penfold Close, Northampton, was cleared of murder by a jury at the town's crown court but found guilty of manslaughter. He has been remanded into custody and will be sentenced at a later date. Smith, who was 16 at the time of the killing, claimed he acted in self-defence as he thought Louis was going to stab him. Louis was called a ""popular, caring son, brother, grandson, nephew and cousin"" by his family Louis was stabbed in a stairwell on Drayton Walk, Kingsthorpe on 25 May 2018 and was taken to hospital, where he died a short time later. Det Insp Stuart Hitchon said the killing ""demonstrates what can be the tragic consequences of carrying a knife"". ""This was a tragic case involving the loss of a very young life and the investigation has been a complex one, all the more painstaking because the main witnesses were just children at the time of the incident,"" he said. Forensics officers at the scene of the stabbing on Drayton Walk Louis' family called him a ""popular, caring son, brother, grandson, nephew and cousin whose life was cruelly cut short"".

"Positive discrimination in favour of black and ethnic minority women applying for jobs is needed in Wales, a union boss has said. Figures suggest black and minority ethnic (BAME) women in Wales are much more likely to be unemployed than their white counterparts. Positive discrimination is currently illegal under the Equality Act 2010. But Shavanah Taj, Wales' first Muslim woman to lead a union, said: ""How else is change ever going to come?"" Ms Taj - head of the PCS trade union in Wales - said organisations also needed to look at progressing BAME employees up the career ladder. ""Positive discrimination should not be a dirty word. Where are [BAME women]? They're not in the boardrooms, they're not on the boards of organisations. There are no BAME women assembly members. ""It's not that people are incapable or don't have the training or skill set, but there's clearly some barriers that we've got to overcome."" Welsh Government 'must do more' on BAME appointments Welsh judges 'need to be more ethnically diverse' Cricket board to implement NFL's 'Rooney Rule' Shavanah Taj is Wales' first Muslim woman to lead a trade union Ms Taj felt she had to leave Wales to get experience in London to rise to the top: ""The research has been doneâ¦ When it comes to race equality in Wales we drop the ball, we need to pick it up and we need to run."" Dr Hade Turkmen, who has written a report for equality charity Chwarae Teg, said the voices of BAME women were often forgotten during decision-making because they are not represented at the top of business and government. She also argued job applications should be anonymous: ""If you leave your name on the CV or application process there is a risk that you are not even shortlisted because your name gives your background , ethnic background, religion."" Youth employment worker Jaffrin Khan, from Cardiff, took the step of changing her surname to Karl on her third attempt applying for a department store job. She corrected the surname during her interview and said she was verbally offered the job. But when her offer was processed, she was told they had ""run out of contracts"". After calling HR to ask what had happened, she was eventually given a contract. ""I couldn't tell you if that was just a coincidence or not. I think that's the worst part about being a woman of colour - you don't want to victimise yourself in every single instance becauseâ¦ you don't want to be outcast from anything because you speak too loudly."" Dr Hade Turkmen said barriers to work such as childcare are ""severely experienced"" by BAME women BAME people make up 5% of the Welsh population, although the figure is higher in cities including Cardiff (18.4%), Swansea (9.5%) and Newport (8.8%). Unemployed people are those who do not have a job, but are actively looking for work. Figures from the Office for National Statistics' annual population survey for July 2017-July 2018, showed BAME women were more likely to be ""economically inactive"" than white women, meaning they do not have a paid job, including caring for others or studying full-time. Dr Turkmen added: ""Childcare and caring responsibilities are a big barrier for women and are severely experienced by BAME women day to day. We have to tackle these general barriers."" Positive discrimination - treating one person more favourably because they have a ""protected characteristic"" such as race or sex - unless there is an occupational requirement, is unlawful, but it is allowed in cases of disability. However, employers are allowed to take ""positive action"" to support those from under-represented groups. According to theEquality and Human Rights Commission,external, this means an employer can encourage people from those groups to apply for jobs. It can also be used in ""tie-break"" decisions when an employer has ""a choice between two candidates who are as qualified as each other"".

"The model was burned at a bonfire party in south London on 3 November 2018 A man who filmed a cardboard effigy of Grenfell Tower being burned on a bonfire has been cleared of posting ""grossly offensive"" material. Prosecutors claimed footage recorded by Paul Bussetti at a London party was racist but the 47-year-old said it was a ""joke"" only shared between friends. He was found not guilty after it was revealed a second video from the party had also been shared on WhatsApp. Magistrates said they could not be sure the film was that taken by Mr Bussetti. The prosecution's handling of evidence in the case was described as ""appalling"" by Chief Magistrate Emma Arbuthnot. The clip of the cardboard building, which had ""Grenfell Tower"" written on it, was recorded at a party attended by about 30 people in south London on 3 November, Westminster Magistrates' Court heard. It was later uploaded to YouTube and sparked outrage, with a relative of one of the 72 people who died in the blaze on 14 June 2017 calling it ""revolting"". Paul Bussetti told the court he was not a racist Mr Bussetti, of South Norwood, was accused of sending ""grossly offensive"" material via a public communications network. He told magistrates the effigy had been created by his friend and the characters featured on the model were meant to represent ""the majority of people that were at the party"", not people who died in the disaster. One black-clad figure, who was referred to as ""ninja"", was meant to represent his friend's son who did martial arts, while his own image had been on the other side of the box, Mr Bussetti said. The father-of-two said he shared the footage with about 20 people on two WhatsApp groups but he had never intended it to go further. When prosecutor Philip Scott suggested he sent the footage because it was in keeping with other ""highly racist"" content he shared, Mr Bussetti replied that it was ""just banter"" and denied being racist. Just before Ms Arbuthnot left court to consider her verdict at the end of the two-day trial, defence barrister Mark Summers QC revealed he had just been made aware of evidence that a second video was recorded. He argued it meant there was ""absolutely no way"" to know which piece of footage had made its way onto YouTube and gone viral. Clearing Mr Bussetti, Ms Arbuthnot said she could not be sure the video used in the case was taken by him. She also said while it was ""in colossal bad taste"", she could not be certain the figures on the tower were not Mr Bussetti and his friends. The chief magistrate added she was ""appalled at the disclosure in this case"" with the last-minute evidence helping to avoid ""a potential miscarriage of justice"". A second charge of causing footage of a ""menacing character"" to be uploaded on YouTube against Mr Bussetti had earlier been dismissed.

"This video can not be played Melissa Compton became seriously ill while swimming the length of the River Severn Targets for 75% of rivers to be healthy by 2027 are ""very unlikely"" to be met in England, a charity has warned. The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) says rivers are ""used as open sewers"". The Environment Agency predicts 75% of rivers in England and along the Scottish and Welsh borders will meet EU expectations by 2027, compared with just 14% now. It is planning an autumn consultation on ""challenges and choices"" faced in cleaning up water. The agency said it would review the target based on ""what can realistically be achieved"". Dr Andrew Singer, senior scientist at the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, said: ""There is no river in the UK that is safe to be swimming in. ""We have so many sewage works that are on a river that even if you treated it perfectly, you would still have enough pathogens coming out of a well-operated sewage works that you wouldn't want to swim in the river."" Melissa Compton became ill while swimming 220 miles of the River Severn for charity Melissa Compton was taken to hospital after ""swallowing sewage"" during a 220-mile swimming challenge in the River Severn. The 39-year-old wastaken ill in Gloucesterin June, having already suffered hypothermia and fatigue while swimming to raise money for charity. ""It was grey, it was very murky, there was a lot of debris in the water and then you could see evidence on the side of what looked like toilet roll,"" said the nurse, who works in Shrewsbury. ""You could taste it and see the debris on the surface."" She believes the government should put more funding into cleaning up rivers and waterways. ""It's 2019, we should be able to clean up all of the waste that we produce."" The Thames is the most polluted river basin district in England The European Union (EU) asked nations to grade rivers between poor, moderate, good and high. Governments should aim for rivers to be ""good"" - meaning relatively unaffected by human activity. ""High"" refers to upland streams in sparsely-populated areas. Under its Water Framework Directive the EU set a target for all rivers to be ""good"" by 2027 but exceptions were allowed if the cost of doing so would be too high. The UK government has aimed for 75% of rivers to be in good health ""as soon as is practicable"", according to its 25-year environment plan. As ofthe latest data available,externaljust 14% of rivers in England were in good health. By 2021 the Environment Agency currently predicts 19% of rivers to be ""good"", rising to almost 75% by 2027. But the WWF said this was ""very unlikely"" to be achieved without tougher regulation and work to restore rivers to a more natural state. This video can not be played Who makes sure our tap water is clean? Dave Tickner, chief freshwater adviser at WWF, said: ""Our rivers are the lifeblood of the countryside - vital for wildlife and people, as well as our economy. ""As weprepare to leave the EU, the UK Government must fast-track flagship legislation to better protect and restore our waterways and invest in effective monitoring and enforcement to ensure water companies and agricultural industry can no longer use our rivers as open sewers."" The Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) stressed it would ""not weaken any of our high environmental standards when we have left the EU"" and would look to enhance them further. Environment Agency officers are investigating the deaths of an estimated 10,000 fish following a pollution spill in Devon The Environment Agency believes about 10,000 fish were killed by an agricultural waste spill in the River Mole in north Devon at the beginning of August. Roach and trout were among the fish that died when achemical-based pollutant got into the river. While the agency said it took such incidents ""very seriously"" and was investigating, it has been accused of not doing enough to prevent such incidents from happening. Feargal Sharkey, former lead singer of The Undertones, said: ""Someone took their eye off the ball."" Mr Sharkey, who is a fly fisherman and chairman of Amwell Magna Fishery in Hertfordshire, campaigns for better management of rivers. He said it was ""outrageous and abominable"" that 86% of rivers in England were not in good health. Feargal Sharkey said river pollution is a ""failure of environmental regulation in this country"" The Environment Agency said its teams ""urgently investigated"" the cause of pollution on the River Mole and ""prevented further pollutant from entering the stream, as well as restoring oxygen levels to protect wildlife"". It tweeted to say it believed the the incident, reported on 2 August, to be ""the largest ever fish kill in Devon and Cornwall"". A few days later 3,000 trout and bullheads died as a result of pollutionin the River Sheppey in Somerset. Fracking halted by largest tremor yet Stolen blind headehog's return 'a miracle' Scrapping HS2 'would be a disaster' Just 3% of rivers in the Thames basin district, which stretches from the Cotswolds and Northamptonshire through London to Kent and Hampshire, were in good health at the last reported check. Solway Tweed, which covers parts of Cumbria, Northumberland and the Scottish borders, has the largest proportion of good rivers, 43%, and is currently predicted to be 99% good by 2027. The data also covered parts of Wales where rivers crossed the English border. Just 10% of river water in the Dee basin district, which runs from Snowdonia in Wales to Chester, was good in 2016 but this is predicted to be 50% by 2027. The data does not cover the rest of Wales and Scotland or Northern Ireland, which have their own devolved environment bodies. We asked for your questions about this story and these are some of the things you wanted to know: If I am concerned about my local river, who do I contact? For rivers in England, the Environment Agency has anincident hotline,externalfor people who want to report pollution to water as well as blocked rivers, flooding or dead fish.

There are various charities working to look after rivers. TheSouth East Rivers Trust,external, for example, says it uses volunteers to help with ""river restoration and cleanups to pollution busting and river monitoring"".

Hundreds of fish were killed in Maidenhead in a pollution incident that saw Thames Water fined Â£607,000 Water companies have been told theirefforts to protect the environment are ""simply unacceptable"". The Environment Agency recorded 1,623 sewerage pollution incidents in England in 2018, four fewer than the year before. These were cases in which water companies discharged raw sewage into the environment, something they should only do during extreme rainfall. Southern Water washit with a record Â£126m punishmentfor spills from its sewage plants and misreporting its performance. In JulyThames Water was fined Â£607,000for two incidents that saw millions of litres of raw sewage released in Maidenhead in 2014. Dr Singer said there needed to be ""zero tolerance"" of sewage pollution and a programme of ""habitat restoration"" to make rivers fit for different types of wildlife again. ""By conceding that 25% of rivers will not meet good ecological status the government is recognising some rivers have deteriorated so far that they need this kind of work to have a chance of getting there. ""I'm not aware of any implementation plan to achieve that 75% good status. If they could do it in such a short space of time, why not do it now?"" A spokesman for the Environment Agency said it would look at ""what can realistically be achieved by 2027 as part of the work to update the river basin managements to be published in 2021"". He said water quality was now ""better than at any time since the industrial revolution"" and the agency was ""taking robust enforcement action against those who pollute our waters"". A spokesman for the water companies' trade association, Water UK, said: ""Water companies have spent around Â£25bn on environmental work since 1995 - action which has improved around 10,000 miles of rivers.

"This video can not be played President Bolsonaro responds to criticism about his previous comments on the Amazon fires Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has said his government lacks the resources to fight the thousands of fires in the Amazon. And he again suggested that non-governmental organisations had started fires in the rainforest, but admitted he had no evidence for this claim. He added that his government was investigating the fires. Earlier, Brazil's Environment Minister Ricardo Salles was heckled at a meeting on climate change. Conservationists have blamed Brazil's government for the Amazon's plight. They say Mr Bolsonaro has encouraged the clearing of land by loggers and farmers, thereby speeding up the deforestation of the rainforest. 'Football pitch' of Amazon forest lost every minute Brazil wildfires prompt 'prayers' for the Amazon rainforest Is the honeymoon period over for Brazil's Bolsonaro? Satellite data published by the National Institute for Space research (Inpe) showsan increase of 85% this year in fires across Brazil,external, most of them in the Amazon region. The largest rainforest in the world, the Amazon is a vital carbon store that slows down the pace of global warming. Answering questions from reporters on Thursday, Mr Bolsonaro said the government couldn't simply get the ministry of the interior to send 40 men to fight a fire. ""Forty men to fight a fire? There aren't the resources. This chaos has arrived,"" he said. On Wednesday, the president had suggested that non-governmental organisations (NGOs) could have started fires as revenge for his government slashing their funding. This video can not be played President Bolsonaro accuses NGOs of starting Amazon wildfires Asked on Thursday who was responsible for starting the fires, he responded: ""The Indians, do you want me to blame the Indians? Do you want me to blame the Martians?... Everyone is a suspect, but the biggest suspects are NGOs."" Asked if there was any proof of this, he replied: ""Did I accuse NGOs directly? I just said I suspect them."" This video can not be played How is the rainforest helping to limit global warming? President Bolsonaro has further angered those concerned over the spike in fires by brushing off the latest data. He argued that it was the season of the ""queimada"", when farmers burn land to clear it before planting but Inpe has noted that the number of fires is not in line with those normally reported during the dry season. It is not the first time Mr Bolsonaro has cast doubt on figures suggesting that the Amazon is deteriorating rapidly. Last month,he accused Inpe's director of lying about the scale of deforestationand trying to undermine the government. It came after Inpe published data showing an 88% increase in deforestation in the Amazon in June compared to the same month a year ago. The director of the agency laterannounced that he was being sacked amid the row. As the minister took to the stage at the Latin American and Caribbean Climate Week in the Brazilian city of Salvador, some of those present shouted ""the Amazon region is burning"". This video can not be played Brazil's environment minister was greeted with heckles at a meeting As soon as his name was announced, most of those attending the opening session of the plenary booed and shouted, with only a few people clapping. The conference, organised by the United Nations, aims to promote action on climate change in the region. It is being attended by representatives from non-governmental organisations, businesses and educational organisations, among others. Climate activists and conservationists have been scathing about the Bolsonaro government and its policies, which favour development over conservation. They say that since President Bolsonaro took office, the Amazon rainforest has suffered losses at an accelerated rate. Their anger was further fuelled by satellite data showing a steep rise in fires in the Amazon region this year. The figures suggest there have been more than 75,000 fires so far this year for the whole of Brazil, compared with just over 40,000 over the same period in 2018. It is the highest number of fires in Brazil since 2010. The figures and satellite images showing most of the state of Roraima, in northern Brazil, covered by smoke have shocked many Brazilians andtriggered a global Twitter trend under the hashtag #prayforamazonia. The US space agency, Nasa, has on the other hand said that overall fire activity in the Amazon basin is slightly below average this year. The region is home to about three million species of plants and animals, and one million indigenous people. BBC UGC and Social News team The plight of the Amazon has seen millions take to social media to decry reports of a massive yearly increase in forest fires. But some of the most striking - and viral - pictures shared by social media users are not all they seem. The hashtag #PrayForAmazonia started to be widely used on Tuesday. It has been included in almost three million tweets since. The most widely shared tweet using that hashtag - with more than a million likes and retweets - includes two aerial images of forest fires, neither of which show the current situation.

And other widely shared images include fires as far away as Siberia or the United States. A video of a Pataxo woman angrily accusing illegal ranchers of starting fires has almost five million views. But the video has been shared on social media since at least July. So while it may point to one potential reason for the reported increase in forest fires, it's not necessarily a depiction of the present situation. Wildfires often occur in the dry season in Brazil but they are also deliberately started in efforts to illegally deforest land for cattle ranching. ""The dry season creates the favourable conditions for the use and spread of fire, but starting a fire is the work of humans, either deliberately or by accident,"" Inpe researcher Alberto Setzer told Reuters news agency. Ricardo Mello, head of the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) Amazon Programme, said the fires were ""a consequence of the increase in deforestation seen in recent figures"". This article initially stated there was a record number of fires in Brazil this year. After more satellite data was made accessible, it has been updated to reflect the fact the fires are instead the worst since 2010.

Is the Arctic set to become a main shipping route? The stark photo highlighting Greenlandâs ice loss 'Why I translate all of Trump's tweets into Chinese' Mr Trump has reportedly taken an interest in Greenland, in part, because of its resources, such as coal, zinc, copper and iron ore. But while Greenland may be rich in minerals, it relies on Denmark for two-thirds of its budget revenue. It has high rates of suicide, alcoholism and unemployment. The US has long seen the island, which sits along a direct route from Europe to North America, as being strategically important. It established the Thule air force and radar base there at the start of the Cold War, which now covers space surveillance and forms the northernmost part of the US ballistic missile early warning system. Meanwhile, new Arctic sea routes are opening up as climate change is blamed for the accelerating thaw of ice in the region. China has recently been taking an interest in the area, too.

"The aim is to keep border crossings like this one at Strabane/Lifford free of checkpoints The prime minister believes ""alternative arrangements"" for the Irish border are the key to scrapping the controversial backstop plan and unlocking a Brexit deal. But what are they and why are they necessary? If Brexit happens, the UK's only land border with the European Union (EU) would be between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. In theory, that would mean checks on certain products because rules and standards may not stay the same. The worry is this could lead to a so-called hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, with infrastructure installed so checks could be carried out. To address this problem, Theresa May negotiated a solution called the Irish backstop. But it proved controversial as many Conservative MPs felt this plan would keep the UK too closely tied to the EU after Brexit with no way of getting out of it. The political opposition to the backstop eventually led to Mrs May's resignation. Boris Johnson, the new Prime Minister, has vowed to scrap it. Boris Johnson has praised a report written by theAlternative Arrangements Commission,external, led by Conservative MPs Greg Hands and Nicky Morgan. The commission's purpose is finding a way of avoiding checks while not having to stick to the EU's rules and standards. This is important to Brexit supporters who want the UK to leave the EU's customs union and be able to strike trade deals around the world. At the heart of the Alternative Arrangements report is a reliance on existing technology and trusted traders schemes. Boris Johnson has previously said there are ""abundant"" technological solutions It recognises companies that are reliable and trustworthy in dealing with customs - the process where businesses declare what goods they're trading. Once on the trusted-trader scheme, approved businesses are allowed to avoid many checks and benefit from fast-track processes. The most common trusted-trader arrangements areAuthorised Economic Operator (AEO),externalschemes. Getting AEO status can be costly and time consuming, so new schemes would be needed for small businesses. For UK traders to benefit from any scheme, the EU would need to recognise it. Some trade experts have also cautioned that it would not guarantee the end of all checks. Another idea is to allow custom checks at a lorry's destination - rather than the border. Technology could aid the process, with satellite navigation systems tracking lorries as they cross from Northern Ireland into the Republic. Mobile inspection teams would then meet the lorries and scan the goods once they had completed their journey. However, such a system would increase costs and complexity, especially for small businesses. Strict EU rules mean food products entering from a non-EU countrymust be subject to checks at the point of entry. For example, a consignment of chicken arriving in the UK from Thailand has to be physically inspected to make sure what's written in the documents matches what's inside the containers. In the event of a no-deal Brexit, the same inspection regime would be required for goods crossing from Northern Ireland to the Republic of Ireland. British Veterinary Association president Simon Doherty says this would be a ""nightmare scenario"" for some producers. ""Take pizza,"" he says. ""Imagine it's produced in Northern Ireland and exported to the Republic of Ireland and each ingredient comes from a different country. ""Let's say it has chicken from Thailand, chorizo from Spain and cheese from Ireland. Each of these individual ingredients will require their own audit trail if the rules are enforced."" Trusted-trader schemes and technological solutions are no real help with this issue as they deal with customs and not product inspections. To get round this, the Alternative Arrangements Commission suggested these checks should take place away from the border. But this wouldn't be allowed under current EU law. The Alternative Arrangements Commission concedes that some way of keeping rules and standards the same is the best way to tackle this issue. The EU has committed to working on alternative arrangements. Germany's Chancellor, Angela Merkel, has said the withdrawal agreement would not need to be reopened if a practical solution to the backstop could be found. It committed to fast-tracking negotiations on replacing the backstop. RTÃ's Brussels correspondent Tony Connolly has reported that EU officials have suggested that any alternative arrangements would have to meet five tests: Avoiding a hard border Complying with the EU customs code Complying with EU principles Complying with WTO rules Protecting the all-island economy But even if the EU agreed to an alternative solution, each one would take time, perhaps years, to implement and would require the cooperation of Ireland and the EU. The Irish government remains sceptical technical and administrative proposals would be enough to eliminate border checks. It has also emphasised any solution must not introduce new checks - even away from the border. It points to the 2017 Joint Report of the EU and UK, a interim deal, in which there was a commitment to avoid a hard border, ""including any physical infrastructure or related checks and controls"". Some Brexit supporters say this would prohibit checks and controls at the border only. The Irish government disagrees.

"The UK has been in a transition period with the EU since last January, during which rules and trade have stayed the same. But all of this will come to an end on 1 January 2021. With just a few weeks left for the UK and the EU to negotiate a trade agreement, both sides are now talking about the prospect of a no-deal outcome. If there's no trade agreement in place, they will have to adjust quickly to doing things very differently. So how are both sides preparing? For the first six months from 1 January, the British government will bring in only minimal checks on goods coming in to the UK, but the EU will have full border checks on goods coming into the EU from the UK straight away. The UK government haswarned thata reasonable worst-case scenario could see queues of 7,000 trucks clogging up the roads around Dover and the Channel Tunnel. The UK government has two contingency plans for this: Operation Brock and Operation Fennel. Operation Brock is a traffic management plan, which it is hoped will prevent more than 10,000 lorries a day from clogging up roads in Kent. Under the scheme, drivers of very large lorries will need to get a special permit - a Kent Access Permit - before they enter the county, and permits will only be issued if they have completed the correct paperwork for exporting goods. Other traffic will be kept flowing around them, in what is known as a contraflow system. Highways England istrialling the moveable road barrier,external, which makes the contraflow system possible, on the M20 over four nights from 11 December. If there are more than 2,000 lorries queued up, the government has made plans for several temporary lorry parks - it bought a 27-acre site in Ashford in Kent. There is also a plan called Operation Fennel in which as many as 7,000 heavy goods vehicles (HGVs) could be diverted to the disused Manston airfield, near Ramsgate. This is part of the government's plans for building facilities away from ports. If further capacity is needed, a ""last resort"" would be to turn the 10-mile M26 motorway into a temporary lorry park. The UK government has also set up the Border Operations Centre to co-ordinate the response to any further disruption. Queuing at ports is not the only problem for lorry drivers. If no further steps are taken, UK lorry drivers would need to apply for documents called ECMT permits to be allowed to enter EU countries.The European Commission has warned that,externalthere are not enough of these permits available, which would mean not enough UK lorries being able to travel to the EU to pick up goods to bring back to the UK. The European Commission said this could result in serious disruptions, ""potentially even threatening public order"". To prevent this, it proposed allowing UK lorries and buses into the EU for six months without special permits, as long as EU drivers are also allowed into the UK. The proposals would also allow regular bus services that pick up and drop off passengers on either side of the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland to continue to do so. The UK has not been clear yet on whether it plans to continue to allow EU operators to enter the country. A similar proposal is on the table for aviation. In the event of no deal, the UK would no longer be a member of the European Common Aviation Area, which allows British airlines to fly to destinations in the EU, and vice versa. The European Commission is proposing a six month regulation to allow flights to continue until a new agreement is in place, but it would require the UK government to offer the same to operators from EU countries. The UK has not yet responded to the proposal. The UK government has told pharmaceutical companies to stockpile and plan alternative supply routes in case of border problems. It has also arranged extra freight capacity for pharmaceutical companies should they need it. Ina memo, seen by the BBCin June, pharmaceutical companies warned the government that some stockpiles of medicines have been ""used up entirely"" by the coronavirus pandemic and said these could not be replenished in time for the UK's exit from the EU. The head of the Association of  the British Pharmaceutical Industrywarned,externalthat not having any sort of deal would cause ""increased complexity, duplication and cost"" in the middle of a pandemic. The government insisted, however, that ""robust contingency plans are in place"". For the coronavirus vaccine, the government says there are contingency plans for making sure the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine made in Belgium can be shipped to the UK if border problems arise. These include alternative sea routes and the use of freight oreven military aircraft. The European Commission has also proposed extending the deadline to reach an agreement on fishing until the end of December 2021. This would allow European fishing vessels to continue fishing in British waters and vice-versa for another year, or until an agreement is reached. But a Downing Street spokesman said the UK ""would never accept arrangements and access to UK fishing waters which are incompatible with our status as an independent coastal state"". The Ministry of Defence has saidit will make four patrol boats availableto monitor UK waters and added that it would have ""robust enforcement measures in place"". As things stand, if nothing is agreed then non-UK boats will not be allowed to fish in UK waters from January. But without a deal, the UK fishing industry would find its extensive exports to EU countries being hit by tariffs (import taxes) and regulatory hurdles. Why is fishing important in Brexit trade talks? The French government has said it would hand out compensation to trawlers if they were not able to fish in UK waters.

"Government money allocated to improve safety was used by the Ulster Grand Prix to refurbish a club house and build facilities, including a shower and toilet block, BBC News NI understands. Funding worth Â£255,000 was announced by Sports Minister Paul Givan in 2017. Some Â£25,000 was spent on safety bales; the rest was spent on building works. Ulster Grand Prix said safety was a ""priority"" and the money was used at the ""paddock and around the track"". It said it made ""detailed proposals"" in its application for the funding, which were ""examined and approved by the minister, officials from the Department of Communities and Sport NI"". Three riders have been killed at the Dundrod circuit since 2017. Both Jamie Hodson, from Wigan, and Gavin Lupton, from West Yorkshire, died after crashes in the 2017 race - which is billed as the fastest road race in the world. Brother's race death 'always with me' 134mph rider breaks Ulster GP record NW200 gets funding boost to help safety In 2018, French rider Fabrice Miguet was killed at Joey's Windmill, the right-hand bend where Hodson came off his bike and hit a telegraph pole the year before. Racers Jamie Hodson, Gavin Lupton and Fabrice Miguet have died at the Ulster Grand Prix since 2017 There is no suggestion of wrongdoing by the Ulster Grand Prix and its representative Geoff Wilson said the improved facilities were used for training seminars and briefings on safety for riders and 600 volunteers. ""For us, safety is our priority and that is not only the track safety, but also the riders and the fans' safety,"" he said. Mr Givan said he had met officials from the Ulster Grand Prix before making the announcement and had been lobbied by his party colleague Ian Paisley to support the proposals. Speaking at the time, Mr Givan said he had been moved to provide the money after the death of Malachi Mitchell Thomas at the North West 200 in 2016. Mr Givan described the funding asone of his most important actions since coming into office.,externalas ""it was to do with trying to save lives"". Sport NI was aware of how the Ulster Grand Prix intended to spend the money, as can be seen from an approved business case which BBC News NI has seen. In total, Â£535,000 was allocated to improve motorsport safety by the Department for Communities, which was distributed by Sport NI. The North West 200 was allocatedÂ£124,000 to carry out safety improvements,and some money was allocated to smaller events. The funding was announced on 24 January 2017, shortly after a snap assembly election had been called.  Â£255,000in safety funding Â£190,000spent on the clubhouse, buildings and riders' paddock Â£40,000spent on hard surfacing to improve access Â£25,000spent on safety bales BBC News NI obtained a copy of the business case for the full Â£535,000 funding, which is then broken down into sections for each race, through a freedom of information request. In the introduction, the business case notes: ""This project is outside of normal competitive process and the business case for the proposed project has been developed by Sport NI following a Northern Ireland Executive decision for this project to be delivered."" Despite the money being announced in January, the projects had to be completed by 31 March 2017. The business case states that a review of each project funded should have been carried out by 31 March 2018. Sport NI told BBC News NI the review had been completed by the grant recipient. Sport NI has not completed any evaluation of how the money was spent, or how effective it was, saying it aimed to complete an evaluation in ""a timely manner, subject to available resources"". The business case shows that, of the money allocated to the Ulster Grand Prix, Â£25,000 was spent on 80 safety bales and Â£230,000 on building and ground works. Dundrod and District Motorcycle club, which organises the race, provided a monitoring return detailing how the money contributed to the safety of participants and spectators along the seven-mile circuit. This states the money was spent on an extension to the riders' paddock, intended to accommodate race vehicles and conform to fire regulations. It also lists the ""completion and fit-out of David Wood Ulster Grand Prix House"", which enabled the club to host ""race safety seminars, marshal training, newcomers' induction courses and training for the hundreds of volunteers involved in running the motorcycle racing event each year"". Paul Givan (centre), pictured here announcing additional funding for the North West 200, was the sports minister when the Ulster Grand Prix funding was confirmed A refurbished David Wood Ulster Grand Prix Househad officially opened two years earlier,external, but organisers said the work had not been completed. Mr Wilson, from Ulster Grand Prix, said none of the 2017 funding was used to cover shortfalls in other building projects. ""Any of the projects that we applied for was put into a proper process through the government that said here's where the investment should go into with a safety focus,"" he said. ""One of those areas was the building that was half-finished, government was aware of that, government knew that. ""Everything that we did was all above board, it was through a process that we went through with government and they were extremely happy with."" Some of the funding was spent on the construction of a new building to help test the safety of bikes - which Ulster Grand Prix said was vital. This building was also fitted with shower and toilet facilities. Some Â£40,000 was also allocated to hard-surfacing existing gravel areas to improve wheelchair access. This video can not be played 'You just don't want to believe it' But the girlfriend of one of the dead riders has questioned whether enough of the funding went towards improving conditions for competitors. ""The thing that doesn't rest well with me is the actual amount they've spent on safety... especially if that's what they've been given the money for,"" said Rachael McKay, the long-time girlfriend of Jamie Hodson. ""I don't begrudge them spending money on facilities as they do need updating, but it's the sheer amount of money. ""More should have been spent on the safety."" Jamie Hodson came back early from a holiday in Cyprus with Rachael McKay to take part in the Ulster Grand Prix. The Department for Communities said it was satisfied the funding had been used as intended, and that Sport NI carried out post-project evaluations ""in an appropriate and timely manner"". Sport NI said the money was spent in line with the business case, adding that it works closely with the sports governing bodies to improve safety. A spokesman for Paul Givan said: ""Sadly, since the investment was made there have been more fatalities. ""However, lives have also been saved, including a rider at the North West 200. ""Whilst the number of incidents and injuries prevented as a result of the investment cannot be fully quantified, undoubtedly it has made a positive impact."" Even though the Ulster Grand Prix lobbied Mr Givan for funding, the scheme was administered by the department, added the spokesman. The organisers of the Ulster Grand Prix said they had presented an application for funding to Mr Givan in 2016, to fund: Safety equipment The completion of David Wood House A new building ""to facilitate race procedures such as machine scrutineering"" ""The improvement of safety around all areas of the race event was a principal factor in the application for funding,"" said Dundrod and District Motorcycle club. Every effort is made by organisers to make the event as safe as possible, they added. ""Risk assessments are carried out each year and improvements are put in place to enhance track safety. ""The dangers of racing in a closed roads environment remain. ""Further investment is required to maintain safety initiatives, not only in motorcycle road racing but across all motorsports in Northern Ireland.""

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson insists that with ""energy and creativity"" a Brexit deal can be struck Boris Johnson has met Emmanuel Macron in Paris for Brexit talks, with the French president saying the UK's vote to quit the EU must be respected. But he added that the Ireland-Northern Ireland backstop plan was ""indispensable"" to preserving political stability and the single market. The backstop, opposed by Mr Johnson, aims to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland after Brexit. Mr Johnson said that with ""energy and creativity we can find a way forward"". On Wednesday German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the onus was on the UK to find a workable plan. Did Boris Johnson put his foot in it in France? Brexit, the border and 'alternative arrangements' Why is the Irish border blocking Brexit? And what is the backstop? UK Prime Minister Mr Johnson insists the backstop must be ditched if a no-deal exit from the EU on 31 October is to be avoided. He argues that it could leave the UK tied to the EU indefinitely, contrary to the result of the 2016 referendum, in which almost 52% of voters opted to leave. But the EU has repeatedly said the withdrawal deal negotiated by former PM Theresa May, which includes the backstop, cannot be renegotiated. However, it has previously said it would be willing to ""improve"" the political declaration - the document that sets out the UK's future relationship with the EU. The handshake between the PM and the president was warm and long-lasting. But it was the words that mattered. President Macron said that, while he had been portrayed as the ""hard boy"" of the EU, he was simply being clear about where he stood. He described the backstop both as an ""indispensable guarantee"" of ""stability in Ireland"" and the means of protecting the integrity of the European single market. But the expectation that he'd refuse point-blank to renegotiate the Brexit deal didn't materialise. Instead, he simply warned that any withdrawal agreement that the two sides might reach in the next month wouldn't be very different from the existing one. And he asked for more ""visibility"" from the UK on its alternative proposals. It would seem that both Mr Macron and Angela Merkel are determined not to shut the door entirely in Boris Johnson's face, and perhaps equally determined not to be blamed for no deal. Speaking after he greeted Mr Johnson at Paris's Elysee Palace, Mr Macron said he was ""very confident"" that the UK and EU would be able to find a solution within 30 days - a timetablesuggestedby Mrs Merkel - ""if there is a good will on both sides"". He said it would not be possible to find a new withdrawal agreement ""very different from the existing one"" within that time, but added that an answer could be reached ""without reshuffling"" the current deal. Mr Macron also denied that he was the ""hard boy in the band"", following suggestions that he would be tougher on the UK than his German counterpart. What is the withdrawal agreement? Brexit: A really simple guide UK 'cannot end freedom of movement' on Brexit day Standing beside Mr Macron, Mr Johnson said he had been ""powerfully encouraged"" by his conversations with Mrs Merkel in Berlin on Wednesday. He emphasised his desire for a deal with the EU but added that it was ""vital for trust in politics"" that the UK left the EU on 31 October. He also said that ""under no circumstances"" would the UK put checks or controls on the Ireland-UK border. The two leaders ate lunch, drank coffee and walked through the Elysee gardens together during their talks, which lasted just under two hours. Mr Johnson then left to fly back to the UK. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: French president ""quite right"" to say Irish backstop indispensable If implemented, the backstop would see Northern Ireland staying aligned to some rules of the EU single market, should the UK and the EU not agree a trade deal after Brexit. It would also see the UK stay in a single customs territory with the EU, and align with current and future EU rules on competition and state aid. These arrangements would apply until both the EU and UK agreed they were no longer necessary. Mrs Merkel has argued that the withdrawal agreement does not need to be reopened if a practical solution to the backstop crisis can be found. Brexit is due to happen on 31 October, with no deal being the default option. The prime minister has said he wants to leave the EU with a deal, but that the UK would be ready if none is reached. Please upgrade your browser Mr Johnson will attend the G7 summit on Saturday in Biarritz, France, alongside other leaders including US President Donald Trump. Asked about Mr Macron's comments, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said he agreed there should not be a hard border on the island of Ireland. He described the Irish peace process as ""an enormous step forward"" which ""cannot be negotiated away by Boris Johnson"". Mr Corbyn has cancelled a trip to Ghana, urging MPs to meet him next week to discuss ways to prevent a no-deal Brexit. He has proposed that MPs should help him defeat the government in a no-confidence motion and install him as a caretaker prime minister. If he wins the vote, he plans to delay Brexit, call a snap election and campaign for another referendum. The Liberal Democrats, SNP, Change UK, Plaid Cymru and the Green Party have agreed to the meeting with Mr Corbyn. But Conservative MP Dame Caroline Spelman and independent MP Nick Boles have said they will not attend. Mr Boles, who quit the Conservatives in April over the party's approach to Brexit, said the Labour leader should prioritise a change in the law to delay leaving the EU ahead of a no-confidence vote.

"This video can not be played Would you notice if you crossed the Irish border? (Video from 2017) Prime Minister Boris Johnson insists ""there is a way"" to avoid checks along the Irish border after Brexit. But why has the Irish border remained a major sticking point in the Brexit negotiations? If Brexit happens, the 310-mile Irish border will represent the only land border between the UK and the EU. As well as no longer being in the EU, Northern Ireland is likely to end up with different rules and standards to its neighbour, the Republic of Ireland. That's because the UK intends to leave the customs union and single market - arrangements designed to make trade easier between EU countries. Lorries travelling to the EU from Northern Ireland would be required to stop at the border for document checks and some product inspections. This would be to ensure their goods meet EU standards. Following incidents likefoot-and-mouth disease,externaland thehorse meat scandal, the EU is very strict about these requirements. In theory, such checks would mean things like cameras and security posts, creating a so-called ""hard border"". Concerns have been raised that the return of a hard border couldjeopardise the Good Friday Agreement. This helped bring the period of violence in Northern Irelandknown as ""The Troubles""to an end. Boris Johnson says there are ""abundant"" technological solutions UK and EU Brexit negotiators came up with a solution - known as the Irish backstop - to avoid border checks. If used, the backstop would keep the UK in a very close relationship with the EU until a trade deal permanently avoiding the need for checks is agreed. However, the backstop proved unacceptable to many Conservative MPs, who feared the UK would be trapped in it indefinitely. Their opposition eventually led toTheresa May's resignation as prime minister. Boris Johnson, the new prime minister, said a revised Brexit deal must include ""the abolition of the backstop"". He says the current solution would mean ""signing away"" the UK's ""economic independence"". This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. A ""wealth of solutions"" including technology could replace the the backstop and avoid the need for a hard border, Boris Johnson said during the Tory leadership campaign. Supporters say custom checks could be done at warehouses before lorries set off. Mobile phone technology or microchips on lorries, would track goods and avoid the need for border posts. However, the EU does not currently share a single border with a non-EU country where checks have been completely eliminated. That includes Norway (not in the EU) and Sweden (an EU member) - which share one of the most technologically advanced borders in the world. Their main crossing point processes about 1,300 lorries a day, with each waiting 20 minutes on average. The EU has said it will consider other solutions to the Irish border problem, but only once the current Brexit deal has been signed off. It has also expressed doubts about a technological solution. The problem with just relying on technology, is that EU law also require some products to be physically checked - chemicals and food are among them. Single UK-Irish food zone suggested by report Border technology 'could take 10 years' Why are vets being recruited in Ireland? Alongside technology, Mr Johnson has also talked about a trusted trader scheme. Businesses would be allowed to by-pass checks once they've proven to be trustworthy and have met certain standards. For it to work, the UK would need to persuade the EU to recognise it. But setting up such a scheme would a take a lot of time and cost a lot of money. The UK would also need to come up with an effective way of enforcing it and prevent smuggling. Another solution that has been proposed is to allow agriculture checks to take place in""mobile units away from the border"".,external However, existing EU law states that animal checks must take place at designated Border Inspections Posts (BIPs)""in the immediate vicinity of the point of entry"",external- which would include the Irish border. The EU says ""geographic constraints"" are the only exception (eg mountains, cliffs, valleys, rivers). In these cases, ""a certain distance from the point of introduction may be tolerated."" So getting the EU to allow checks to take place away from the border, for non-geographic reasons, would require a change in the rules. DUP leader Arlene Foster also believes technology and other solutions can prevent a hard border after Brexit Mr Johnson has also suggested the idea ofan all-Ireland food standards zone. In other words, Northern Ireland would keep the same food and animal standards as the Republic of Ireland after Brexit. However, it's unclear how food and animal products would be separated from other trade in order to prevent smuggling. If smuggling was to occur, it could threaten the integrity of the single market. But some say the UK could go further and agree a Northern Ireland-only backstop. This would see Northern Ireland remain in the customs union and parts of the single market - eliminating the need for any cross-border checks. But the DUP, which supports the Conservatives in government, has previously rejected the idea of a Northern Ireland backstop on the basis it would create checks between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. No-one has started building border posts and the UK and Irish governments say they do not want a hard border. So there is a very real question, in the event of a no-deal Brexit, about who would actually install the border posts if the EU insist they're necessary.

"This year's exam results season has been like no other, but for the hundreds of thousands of students receiving their GCSE results, they will still have to decide what to do next. So how has post-16 education changed over the years? Until recently, students could head into work immediately after completing their GCSEs. However, changesintroduced by the previous Labour government,externalmean that since 2015, everyone must take part in some form of training or education until they are 18 - the first change to the school leaving age since 1972. Despite this, thousands still go straight into employment or avoid education and training, as there is no mechanism for the government to enforce the policy. Local authorities do, however, have to advertise, advise and fund the opportunities for 16 and 17-year-olds. In Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, the school leaving age remains 16. In Wales, 78% of 16 to 18-year-olds are in education - and about 90% of 16 to 17-year-olds in Northern Ireland. There are a number of options for 16-year-olds who decide to continue full-time education. First, they can continue at the school where they studied GCSEs. Most, however, choose to go to sixth-form or further education colleges. These tend to be larger and offer greater freedom for students. Do academies get better results? What does it mean to be an academy school? Is college right for me? However, while sixth-form colleges focus more on preparing students for university by teaching A-levels, FE colleges offer more skills-based and technical courses. Before starting further education in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, students will sit their GCSEs, normally at 16. In Scotland, they will sit thebroadly comparable National 5s. Attainment in GCSEs has been improving, which has sparked concerns about grade inflation and easier exams. And this led, in part, tothe rollout of tougher GCSEsby the Conservative-led coalition government. In 2020, the proportion of passing grades jumped to 76%, up from 67.3% in the previous year. This is because exams were cancelled and teacher's estimated grades were used instead. Call for urgent review into exam results 'fiasco' How did the A-level algorithm work? In England, those who fail English or maths the first time around are expected to sit the exam as many times as they need to until they're 19, alongside their training or education. How do the new 9-1 grades work? Q&A: GCSE changes in England GCSE results rise despite tougher exams The charity Impetus has pointed out this has meantsome people sitting these exams up to nine times,externalbefore they no longer have to do so. In 2019, the proportion of GCSE entries being marked A*-C/9-4 ranged from 62.8% in Wales to 82.2% in Northern Ireland. We have not included this year's figures because they do not compare like for like. The vast majority will achieve at least five GCSEs by the age of 19. But only 60% reach the next level of qualification - a vocational course (such as a BTec), academic qualification (most commonly A-levels) or certified advanced apprenticeship. While A-levels remain the most popular choice, vocational qualifications are increasing as individuals move towards more classroom-based learning structures for technical or professional skills. In Wales, 62.4% of 18 to 24-year-olds have an A-level or equivalent qualification. Vocational qualifications focus on industry-specific skills. They tend to emphasise projects or coursework-based assessments rather than exams (as is the case with A-levels) and are done in conjunction with industry bodies. The most popular vocational courses are BTecs, for which uptake has tripled since 2006. BTec Nationals: Who are the students who didn't just do A-levels? BTec results: CBI Wales urges more vocational focus Although many are designed to lead to skilled jobs without the need for university education, they are increasingly being recognised - and accepted - as a route into university. Research by the Social Market Foundationsuggests they have broadened access,externalto university, particularly among those from white working-class backgrounds. The reasons for their uptake with certain demographics vary. Some research indicates,externala less academic route suits those who struggled with GCSEs - but pupils are also attracted by the wider variety of subjects and freedom offered by further education colleges. In 2011,Prof Alison Wolf's review of vocational qualifications,externalsaid many of them ""offered little to no labour market value"". And this, in part, led to the Department for Education removing hundreds of courses from the list of those that count towards college performance tables. Many vocational courses axed from league tables Vocational training shake-up 'most ambitious since A-levels' T-levels: What are they? Additionally, it has introducedT-level awards,externalfor England, being launched this autumn and fully implemented over the next three years. These will have a greater focus on work placements than existing vocational qualifications. The image of vocational qualifications preparing students solely for hands-on, practical jobs is far from accurate - the most popular range of vocational courses today is business. These courses can range from learning how to pitch business ideas to assessing a company's books. Another popular range of courses is health and social care. Other popular courses prepare students for careers in plumbing, horticulture, hairdressing or sound engineering. With more than a quarter of a million people sitting A-levels in England, Wales and Northern Ireland each year, this remains by far the most popular post-16 choice. Until 1987, the proportion of top grades - an A back then - was capped at 10%. Since then, there has been a gradual increase in the proportion receiving an A or A* (which was introduced in 2010). And, as with GCSEs, this has driven a conversation about whether exams have become easier and waspart of the reason for changesby the coalition government. What was new about 2018's A-Level exams? Teenagers given updated advice on A-level choices These included reducing the relevance of AS-levels and a decrease in coursework. Once again,this year's results have not been includedbecause of exams being cancelled in the pandemic and teachers' estimated grades being used instead. Decades of government-backed initiatives to increase uptake of science, technology, engineering and maths (Stem) subjects have seen maths pushing English into second place as the most popular A-level subject. General studies has all but disappeared, as universities said they would no longer accept it as a qualification, so 2019 was the final year it was being taken. Adecline in traditional modern languageshas seen a fall in French and German - but more global languages, such as Mandarin, Spanish and Arabic, have slowly become more popular. To encourage apprenticeships, the government established an ""apprenticeship levy"" in 2017, a tax paid by large businesses to fund their creation. Apprenticeships: Eight things you need to know Apprenticeship take-up down by a quarter But the number of apprenticeship starts has remained stagnant. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland manage their own apprenticeship schemes and how they are funded. The largest three sectors for under-19 apprenticeships are health, business and engineering, which together accounted for around 60,000 starts in 2019. Last year, there were 4,200 apprenticeship starts in Wales and 2,700 in Northern Ireland. Totalschool spending has decreased by 8% since 2010, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies. Further education and sixth-form colleges have faced similar cuts but school sixth forms have fared worse. Since 2016, funding for further education has been on a per-pupil basis, meaning each child is given a minimum amount of funding, as long as the qualification is deemed suitable by the government. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has pledged to increase spending for further education, but theIFS notes planned increases only take the budget,externalback to 2015 levels. By Jamie McIvor, BBC Scotland education correspondent Scotland's education system was always separate from the system south of the border, even before devolution. In Scotland, students still have the right to leave school at 16. They are not compelled to remain in education or training until they are 18 although the overwhelming majority do. However, there has been a fundamental shift in the character of the latter years at secondary school since the 1980s. In the 1980s, almost a third of students left school by age 16. Students who stayed after this were normally the more academically able - they would usually be studying for Scottish Highers, similar to A-levels in the rest of the UK. Today, these students have the chance to study for a wide range of qualifications - some of which are practical or vocational rather than academic. It's now unusual to leave at 16 without a good reason and most complete some form of further education, including modern apprenticeships. The number who are not in education, employment or training (Neets) is relatively low.

"Jane Lax appeared as an audience member on Question Time in May A Tory activist has been suspended by the party after she joked about Nicola Sturgeon's miscarriage on Twitter. Jane Lax asked ""Is that when she dropped a book?"" in response to another Twitter user's claim that the first minister's miscarriage was ""fictional"". Mrs Lax, who was treasurer of the Moray Conservative Association, then posted three laughing emojis. A Scottish Conservative spokesman said the comments were ""completely unacceptable"". He added: ""As a result, Jane Lax has been suspended by the party pending a disciplinary procedure and has resigned as treasurer of the Moray association. ""Mrs Lax recognises she made a mistake and is extremely apologetic."" Mrs Lax, who is said to have been a member of the Moray association for two years, tweeted under the user name ""Jane - SNP don't speak for me"". She has now made her account private. Screenshots of Ms Lax's tweets have been shared on social media Ms Sturgeonrevealed in 2016that she had suffered a miscarriage five years earlier, while she was deputy first minister. The first minister, who is married to SNP chief executive Peter Murrell, was in the early stages of her pregnancy and preparing to share the news when she lost her baby. Ms Sturgeon spoke publicly about the miscarriage ahead of details being published - with her blessing - in a book by journalist Mandy Rhodes. She said she hoped allowing the details to be made public would challenge assumptions about women who do not have children. Speaking at an event at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe earlier this week, Ms Sturgeon described the ""horrible, misogynist, really filthy, disgusting"" abuse she receives online. She also warned that social media was distorting political debate in Scotland and across the world.

"This video can not be played Watch: Greenland wouldn't be the first time the US bought territory US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has praised Denmark amid a public row over Greenland that saw President Donald Trump cancel a visit to the country. In a phone call with Danish Foreign Minister Jeppe Kofod, Mr Pompeo ""expressed appreciation for Denmark's co-operation"" as a US ally. Mr Kofod welcomed the ""frank, friendly and constructive talk"". It came after Mr Trump said Denmark's prime minister had been ""nasty"" when rebuffing his idea of buying Greenland. Mette Frederiksen had called his ambitions of buying the autonomous Danish territory ""absurd"". She said she was ""disappointed and surprised"" that he had cancelled his visit. The trip was scheduled to take place on 2 September, at the invitation of Denmark's Queen Margrethe II. Greenland: What you need to know Why would Trump want to buy Greenland? The US State Department said Mr Pompeo and Mr Kofod had a friendly phone call on Wednesday about the ""postponement"" of the president's trip. ""The secretary expressed appreciation for Denmark's co-operation as one of the United States' allies,externaland Denmark's contributions to address shared global security priorities,"" spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said in a statement. ""The secretary and Foreign Minister Kofod also discussed strengthening co-operation with the Kingdom of Denmark - including Greenland - in the Arctic.""

The stark photo highlighting Greenlandâs ice loss 'Why I translate all of Trump's tweets into Chinese' Mr Trump has reportedly taken an interest in Greenland, in part, because of its resources, such as coal, zinc, copper and iron ore. But while Greenland may be rich in minerals, it relies on Denmark for two-thirds of its budget revenue. It has high rates of suicide, alcoholism and unemployment. The US has long seen the island, which sits along a direct route from Europe to North America, as being strategically important. It established the Thule air force and radar base there at the start of the Cold War, which now covers space surveillance and forms the northernmost part of the US ballistic missile early warning system. Meanwhile, new Arctic sea routes are opening up as climate change is blamed for the accelerating thaw of ice in the region. China has recently been taking an interest in the area, too.

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson insists that with ""energy and creativity"" a Brexit deal can be struck Boris Johnson has met Emmanuel Macron in Paris for Brexit talks, with the French president saying the UK's vote to quit the EU must be respected. But he added that the Ireland-Northern Ireland backstop plan was ""indispensable"" to preserving political stability and the single market. The backstop, opposed by Mr Johnson, aims to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland after Brexit. Mr Johnson said that with ""energy and creativity we can find a way forward"". On Wednesday German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the onus was on the UK to find a workable plan. Did Boris Johnson put his foot in it in France? Brexit, the border and 'alternative arrangements' Why is the Irish border blocking Brexit? And what is the backstop? UK Prime Minister Mr Johnson insists the backstop must be ditched if a no-deal exit from the EU on 31 October is to be avoided. He argues that it could leave the UK tied to the EU indefinitely, contrary to the result of the 2016 referendum, in which almost 52% of voters opted to leave. But the EU has repeatedly said the withdrawal deal negotiated by former PM Theresa May, which includes the backstop, cannot be renegotiated. However, it has previously said it would be willing to ""improve"" the political declaration - the document that sets out the UK's future relationship with the EU. The handshake between the PM and the president was warm and long-lasting. But it was the words that mattered. President Macron said that, while he had been portrayed as the ""hard boy"" of the EU, he was simply being clear about where he stood. He described the backstop both as an ""indispensable guarantee"" of ""stability in Ireland"" and the means of protecting the integrity of the European single market. But the expectation that he'd refuse point-blank to renegotiate the Brexit deal didn't materialise. Instead, he simply warned that any withdrawal agreement that the two sides might reach in the next month wouldn't be very different from the existing one. And he asked for more ""visibility"" from the UK on its alternative proposals. It would seem that both Mr Macron and Angela Merkel are determined not to shut the door entirely in Boris Johnson's face, and perhaps equally determined not to be blamed for no deal. Speaking after he greeted Mr Johnson at Paris's Elysee Palace, Mr Macron said he was ""very confident"" that the UK and EU would be able to find a solution within 30 days - a timetablesuggestedby Mrs Merkel - ""if there is a good will on both sides"". He said it would not be possible to find a new withdrawal agreement ""very different from the existing one"" within that time, but added that an answer could be reached ""without reshuffling"" the current deal. Mr Macron also denied that he was the ""hard boy in the band"", following suggestions that he would be tougher on the UK than his German counterpart. What is the withdrawal agreement? Brexit: A really simple guide UK 'cannot end freedom of movement' on Brexit day Standing beside Mr Macron, Mr Johnson said he had been ""powerfully encouraged"" by his conversations with Mrs Merkel in Berlin on Wednesday. He emphasised his desire for a deal with the EU but added that it was ""vital for trust in politics"" that the UK left the EU on 31 October. He also said that ""under no circumstances"" would the UK put checks or controls on the Ireland-UK border. The two leaders ate lunch, drank coffee and walked through the Elysee gardens together during their talks, which lasted just under two hours. Mr Johnson then left to fly back to the UK. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: French president ""quite right"" to say Irish backstop indispensable If implemented, the backstop would see Northern Ireland staying aligned to some rules of the EU single market, should the UK and the EU not agree a trade deal after Brexit. It would also see the UK stay in a single customs territory with the EU, and align with current and future EU rules on competition and state aid. These arrangements would apply until both the EU and UK agreed they were no longer necessary. Mrs Merkel has argued that the withdrawal agreement does not need to be reopened if a practical solution to the backstop crisis can be found. Brexit is due to happen on 31 October, with no deal being the default option. The prime minister has said he wants to leave the EU with a deal, but that the UK would be ready if none is reached. Please upgrade your browser Mr Johnson will attend the G7 summit on Saturday in Biarritz, France, alongside other leaders including US President Donald Trump. Asked about Mr Macron's comments, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said he agreed there should not be a hard border on the island of Ireland. He described the Irish peace process as ""an enormous step forward"" which ""cannot be negotiated away by Boris Johnson"". Mr Corbyn has cancelled a trip to Ghana, urging MPs to meet him next week to discuss ways to prevent a no-deal Brexit. He has proposed that MPs should help him defeat the government in a no-confidence motion and install him as a caretaker prime minister. If he wins the vote, he plans to delay Brexit, call a snap election and campaign for another referendum. The Liberal Democrats, SNP, Change UK, Plaid Cymru and the Green Party have agreed to the meeting with Mr Corbyn. But Conservative MP Dame Caroline Spelman and independent MP Nick Boles have said they will not attend. Mr Boles, who quit the Conservatives in April over the party's approach to Brexit, said the Labour leader should prioritise a change in the law to delay leaving the EU ahead of a no-confidence vote.

"This video can not be played President Bolsonaro responds to criticism about his previous comments on the Amazon fires Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has said his government lacks the resources to fight the thousands of fires in the Amazon. And he again suggested that non-governmental organisations had started fires in the rainforest, but admitted he had no evidence for this claim. He added that his government was investigating the fires. Earlier, Brazil's Environment Minister Ricardo Salles was heckled at a meeting on climate change. Conservationists have blamed Brazil's government for the Amazon's plight. They say Mr Bolsonaro has encouraged the clearing of land by loggers and farmers, thereby speeding up the deforestation of the rainforest. 'Football pitch' of Amazon forest lost every minute Brazil wildfires prompt 'prayers' for the Amazon rainforest Is the honeymoon period over for Brazil's Bolsonaro? Satellite data published by the National Institute for Space research (Inpe) showsan increase of 85% this year in fires across Brazil,external, most of them in the Amazon region. The largest rainforest in the world, the Amazon is a vital carbon store that slows down the pace of global warming. Answering questions from reporters on Thursday, Mr Bolsonaro said the government couldn't simply get the ministry of the interior to send 40 men to fight a fire. ""Forty men to fight a fire? There aren't the resources. This chaos has arrived,"" he said. On Wednesday, the president had suggested that non-governmental organisations (NGOs) could have started fires as revenge for his government slashing their funding. This video can not be played President Bolsonaro accuses NGOs of starting Amazon wildfires Asked on Thursday who was responsible for starting the fires, he responded: ""The Indians, do you want me to blame the Indians? Do you want me to blame the Martians?... Everyone is a suspect, but the biggest suspects are NGOs."" Asked if there was any proof of this, he replied: ""Did I accuse NGOs directly? I just said I suspect them."" This video can not be played How is the rainforest helping to limit global warming? President Bolsonaro has further angered those concerned over the spike in fires by brushing off the latest data. He argued that it was the season of the ""queimada"", when farmers burn land to clear it before planting but Inpe has noted that the number of fires is not in line with those normally reported during the dry season. It is not the first time Mr Bolsonaro has cast doubt on figures suggesting that the Amazon is deteriorating rapidly. Last month,he accused Inpe's director of lying about the scale of deforestationand trying to undermine the government. It came after Inpe published data showing an 88% increase in deforestation in the Amazon in June compared to the same month a year ago. The director of the agency laterannounced that he was being sacked amid the row. As the minister took to the stage at the Latin American and Caribbean Climate Week in the Brazilian city of Salvador, some of those present shouted ""the Amazon region is burning"". This video can not be played Brazil's environment minister was greeted with heckles at a meeting As soon as his name was announced, most of those attending the opening session of the plenary booed and shouted, with only a few people clapping. The conference, organised by the United Nations, aims to promote action on climate change in the region. It is being attended by representatives from non-governmental organisations, businesses and educational organisations, among others. Climate activists and conservationists have been scathing about the Bolsonaro government and its policies, which favour development over conservation. They say that since President Bolsonaro took office, the Amazon rainforest has suffered losses at an accelerated rate. Their anger was further fuelled by satellite data showing a steep rise in fires in the Amazon region this year. The figures suggest there have been more than 75,000 fires so far this year for the whole of Brazil, compared with just over 40,000 over the same period in 2018. It is the highest number of fires in Brazil since 2010. The figures and satellite images showing most of the state of Roraima, in northern Brazil, covered by smoke have shocked many Brazilians andtriggered a global Twitter trend under the hashtag #prayforamazonia. The US space agency, Nasa, has on the other hand said that overall fire activity in the Amazon basin is slightly below average this year. The region is home to about three million species of plants and animals, and one million indigenous people. BBC UGC and Social News team The plight of the Amazon has seen millions take to social media to decry reports of a massive yearly increase in forest fires. But some of the most striking - and viral - pictures shared by social media users are not all they seem. The hashtag #PrayForAmazonia started to be widely used on Tuesday. It has been included in almost three million tweets since. The most widely shared tweet using that hashtag - with more than a million likes and retweets - includes two aerial images of forest fires, neither of which show the current situation.

And other widely shared images include fires as far away as Siberia or the United States. A video of a Pataxo woman angrily accusing illegal ranchers of starting fires has almost five million views. But the video has been shared on social media since at least July. So while it may point to one potential reason for the reported increase in forest fires, it's not necessarily a depiction of the present situation. Wildfires often occur in the dry season in Brazil but they are also deliberately started in efforts to illegally deforest land for cattle ranching. ""The dry season creates the favourable conditions for the use and spread of fire, but starting a fire is the work of humans, either deliberately or by accident,"" Inpe researcher Alberto Setzer told Reuters news agency. Ricardo Mello, head of the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) Amazon Programme, said the fires were ""a consequence of the increase in deforestation seen in recent figures"". This article initially stated there was a record number of fires in Brazil this year. After more satellite data was made accessible, it has been updated to reflect the fact the fires are instead the worst since 2010.

"Government money allocated to improve safety was used by the Ulster Grand Prix to refurbish a club house and build facilities, including a shower and toilet block, BBC News NI understands. Funding worth Â£255,000 was announced by Sports Minister Paul Givan in 2017. Some Â£25,000 was spent on safety bales; the rest was spent on building works. Ulster Grand Prix said safety was a ""priority"" and the money was used at the ""paddock and around the track"". It said it made ""detailed proposals"" in its application for the funding, which were ""examined and approved by the minister, officials from the Department of Communities and Sport NI"". Three riders have been killed at the Dundrod circuit since 2017. Both Jamie Hodson, from Wigan, and Gavin Lupton, from West Yorkshire, died after crashes in the 2017 race - which is billed as the fastest road race in the world. Brother's race death 'always with me' 134mph rider breaks Ulster GP record NW200 gets funding boost to help safety In 2018, French rider Fabrice Miguet was killed at Joey's Windmill, the right-hand bend where Hodson came off his bike and hit a telegraph pole the year before. Racers Jamie Hodson, Gavin Lupton and Fabrice Miguet have died at the Ulster Grand Prix since 2017 There is no suggestion of wrongdoing by the Ulster Grand Prix and its representative Geoff Wilson said the improved facilities were used for training seminars and briefings on safety for riders and 600 volunteers. ""For us, safety is our priority and that is not only the track safety, but also the riders and the fans' safety,"" he said. Mr Givan said he had met officials from the Ulster Grand Prix before making the announcement and had been lobbied by his party colleague Ian Paisley to support the proposals. Speaking at the time, Mr Givan said he had been moved to provide the money after the death of Malachi Mitchell Thomas at the North West 200 in 2016. Mr Givan described the funding asone of his most important actions since coming into office.,externalas ""it was to do with trying to save lives"". Sport NI was aware of how the Ulster Grand Prix intended to spend the money, as can be seen from an approved business case which BBC News NI has seen. In total, Â£535,000 was allocated to improve motorsport safety by the Department for Communities, which was distributed by Sport NI. The North West 200 was allocatedÂ£124,000 to carry out safety improvements,and some money was allocated to smaller events. The funding was announced on 24 January 2017, shortly after a snap assembly election had been called.  Â£255,000in safety funding Â£190,000spent on the clubhouse, buildings and riders' paddock Â£40,000spent on hard surfacing to improve access Â£25,000spent on safety bales BBC News NI obtained a copy of the business case for the full Â£535,000 funding, which is then broken down into sections for each race, through a freedom of information request. In the introduction, the business case notes: ""This project is outside of normal competitive process and the business case for the proposed project has been developed by Sport NI following a Northern Ireland Executive decision for this project to be delivered."" Despite the money being announced in January, the projects had to be completed by 31 March 2017. The business case states that a review of each project funded should have been carried out by 31 March 2018. Sport NI told BBC News NI the review had been completed by the grant recipient. Sport NI has not completed any evaluation of how the money was spent, or how effective it was, saying it aimed to complete an evaluation in ""a timely manner, subject to available resources"". The business case shows that, of the money allocated to the Ulster Grand Prix, Â£25,000 was spent on 80 safety bales and Â£230,000 on building and ground works. Dundrod and District Motorcycle club, which organises the race, provided a monitoring return detailing how the money contributed to the safety of participants and spectators along the seven-mile circuit. This states the money was spent on an extension to the riders' paddock, intended to accommodate race vehicles and conform to fire regulations. It also lists the ""completion and fit-out of David Wood Ulster Grand Prix House"", which enabled the club to host ""race safety seminars, marshal training, newcomers' induction courses and training for the hundreds of volunteers involved in running the motorcycle racing event each year"". Paul Givan (centre), pictured here announcing additional funding for the North West 200, was the sports minister when the Ulster Grand Prix funding was confirmed A refurbished David Wood Ulster Grand Prix Househad officially opened two years earlier,external, but organisers said the work had not been completed. Mr Wilson, from Ulster Grand Prix, said none of the 2017 funding was used to cover shortfalls in other building projects. ""Any of the projects that we applied for was put into a proper process through the government that said here's where the investment should go into with a safety focus,"" he said. ""One of those areas was the building that was half-finished, government was aware of that, government knew that. ""Everything that we did was all above board, it was through a process that we went through with government and they were extremely happy with."" Some of the funding was spent on the construction of a new building to help test the safety of bikes - which Ulster Grand Prix said was vital. This building was also fitted with shower and toilet facilities. Some Â£40,000 was also allocated to hard-surfacing existing gravel areas to improve wheelchair access. This video can not be played 'You just don't want to believe it' But the girlfriend of one of the dead riders has questioned whether enough of the funding went towards improving conditions for competitors. ""The thing that doesn't rest well with me is the actual amount they've spent on safety... especially if that's what they've been given the money for,"" said Rachael McKay, the long-time girlfriend of Jamie Hodson. ""I don't begrudge them spending money on facilities as they do need updating, but it's the sheer amount of money. ""More should have been spent on the safety."" Jamie Hodson came back early from a holiday in Cyprus with Rachael McKay to take part in the Ulster Grand Prix. The Department for Communities said it was satisfied the funding had been used as intended, and that Sport NI carried out post-project evaluations ""in an appropriate and timely manner"". Sport NI said the money was spent in line with the business case, adding that it works closely with the sports governing bodies to improve safety. A spokesman for Paul Givan said: ""Sadly, since the investment was made there have been more fatalities. ""However, lives have also been saved, including a rider at the North West 200. ""Whilst the number of incidents and injuries prevented as a result of the investment cannot be fully quantified, undoubtedly it has made a positive impact."" Even though the Ulster Grand Prix lobbied Mr Givan for funding, the scheme was administered by the department, added the spokesman. The organisers of the Ulster Grand Prix said they had presented an application for funding to Mr Givan in 2016, to fund: Safety equipment The completion of David Wood House A new building ""to facilitate race procedures such as machine scrutineering"" ""The improvement of safety around all areas of the race event was a principal factor in the application for funding,"" said Dundrod and District Motorcycle club. Every effort is made by organisers to make the event as safe as possible, they added. ""Risk assessments are carried out each year and improvements are put in place to enhance track safety. ""The dangers of racing in a closed roads environment remain. ""Further investment is required to maintain safety initiatives, not only in motorcycle road racing but across all motorsports in Northern Ireland.""

"Positive discrimination in favour of black and ethnic minority women applying for jobs is needed in Wales, a union boss has said. Figures suggest black and minority ethnic (BAME) women in Wales are much more likely to be unemployed than their white counterparts. Positive discrimination is currently illegal under the Equality Act 2010. But Shavanah Taj, Wales' first Muslim woman to lead a union, said: ""How else is change ever going to come?"" Ms Taj - head of the PCS trade union in Wales - said organisations also needed to look at progressing BAME employees up the career ladder. ""Positive discrimination should not be a dirty word. Where are [BAME women]? They're not in the boardrooms, they're not on the boards of organisations. There are no BAME women assembly members. ""It's not that people are incapable or don't have the training or skill set, but there's clearly some barriers that we've got to overcome."" Welsh Government 'must do more' on BAME appointments Welsh judges 'need to be more ethnically diverse' Cricket board to implement NFL's 'Rooney Rule' Shavanah Taj is Wales' first Muslim woman to lead a trade union Ms Taj felt she had to leave Wales to get experience in London to rise to the top: ""The research has been doneâ¦ When it comes to race equality in Wales we drop the ball, we need to pick it up and we need to run."" Dr Hade Turkmen, who has written a report for equality charity Chwarae Teg, said the voices of BAME women were often forgotten during decision-making because they are not represented at the top of business and government. She also argued job applications should be anonymous: ""If you leave your name on the CV or application process there is a risk that you are not even shortlisted because your name gives your background , ethnic background, religion."" Youth employment worker Jaffrin Khan, from Cardiff, took the step of changing her surname to Karl on her third attempt applying for a department store job. She corrected the surname during her interview and said she was verbally offered the job. But when her offer was processed, she was told they had ""run out of contracts"". After calling HR to ask what had happened, she was eventually given a contract. ""I couldn't tell you if that was just a coincidence or not. I think that's the worst part about being a woman of colour - you don't want to victimise yourself in every single instance becauseâ¦ you don't want to be outcast from anything because you speak too loudly."" Dr Hade Turkmen said barriers to work such as childcare are ""severely experienced"" by BAME women BAME people make up 5% of the Welsh population, although the figure is higher in cities including Cardiff (18.4%), Swansea (9.5%) and Newport (8.8%). Unemployed people are those who do not have a job, but are actively looking for work. Figures from the Office for National Statistics' annual population survey for July 2017-July 2018, showed BAME women were more likely to be ""economically inactive"" than white women, meaning they do not have a paid job, including caring for others or studying full-time. Dr Turkmen added: ""Childcare and caring responsibilities are a big barrier for women and are severely experienced by BAME women day to day. We have to tackle these general barriers."" Positive discrimination - treating one person more favourably because they have a ""protected characteristic"" such as race or sex - unless there is an occupational requirement, is unlawful, but it is allowed in cases of disability. However, employers are allowed to take ""positive action"" to support those from under-represented groups. According to theEquality and Human Rights Commission,external, this means an employer can encourage people from those groups to apply for jobs. It can also be used in ""tie-break"" decisions when an employer has ""a choice between two candidates who are as qualified as each other"".

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""We do need that backstop removed"" German Chancellor Angela Merkel has suggested an alternative to the Irish border backstop - a key Brexit sticking point - could be found within 30 days. Speaking at a news conference alongside Prime Minister Boris Johnson in Berlin, she stressed it would be up to the UK to offer a workable plan. The PM said he was ""more than happy"" with that ""blistering timetable"". He accepted the ""onus"" was on the UK, but said he believed there was ""ample scope"" for a new deal to be reached. In his first overseas visit to a fellow leader, Mr Johnson is meeting Mrs Merkel after he told the EU the backstop - which aims to prevent a hard Irish border after Brexit - must be ditched if a no-deal exit was to be avoided. He will meet French President Emmanuel Macron on Thursday, before attending the G7 summit on Saturday alongside other leaders including US President Donald Trump. The EU has repeatedly said the withdrawal deal negotiated by former PM Theresa May, which includes the backstop, cannot be renegotiated. And - despite Mrs Merkel's comments - that message was echoed by Mr Macron on Wednesday evening. ""Renegotiation of the terms currently proposed by the British is not an option that exists, and that has always been made clear by [EU] President Tusk,"" he told reporters in Paris. Why is the Irish border blocking Brexit? And what is the backstop? What did we learn from Boris Johnson's letter to the EU? At the news conference, the German chancellor said a realistic alternative to the plan would require ""absolute clarity"" on the post-Brexit future relationship between the UK and the EU. ""The backstop has always been a fall-back option until this issue is solved,"" she said. ""It was said we will probably find a solution in two years. But we could also find one in the next 30 days, why not?"" Mr Johnson replied: ""You rightly say the onus is on us to produce those solutions, those ideas [...] and that is what we want to do. ""You have set a very blistering timetable of 30 days - if I understood you correctly, I am more than happy with that,"" he added. He added that alternatives to the backstop had not been ""actively proposed"" under his predecessor Theresa May - but he was pressed by Mrs Merkel to spell out what such alternatives might look like. The prime minister has insisted he wants the UK to leave the EU with a renegotiated withdrawal deal, but the UK must leave on 31 October ""do or die"". Please upgrade your browser If implemented, the backstop would see Northern Ireland staying aligned to some rules of the EU single market, should the UK and the EU not agree a trade deal after Brexit. It would also see the UK stay in a single customs territory with the EU, and align with current and future EU rules on competition and state aid. These arrangements would apply until both the EU and UK agreed they were no longer necessary. Brexit supporters fear this could leave the UK tied to the EU indefinitely. Mr Johnson called the backstop ""anti-democratic"" and ""unviable"". Should we be optimistic about the scope for a Brexit breakthrough after Angela Merkel suggested a solution to remove the need for the backstop could be found - possibly even within just 30 days? Boris Johnson will certainly be pleased the German chancellor has left a door open. But don't get carried away. There's a reason Europe is so adamant the backstop has to stay in the Brexit deal - it just doesn't believe there is a workable alternative available right now. Boris Johnson says it's his job to find a solution and accepted a deadline of 30 days to come up with one.

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson insists that with ""energy and creativity"" a Brexit deal can be struck Boris Johnson has met Emmanuel Macron in Paris for Brexit talks, with the French president saying the UK's vote to quit the EU must be respected. But he added that the Ireland-Northern Ireland backstop plan was ""indispensable"" to preserving political stability and the single market. The backstop, opposed by Mr Johnson, aims to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland after Brexit. Mr Johnson said that with ""energy and creativity we can find a way forward"". On Wednesday German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the onus was on the UK to find a workable plan. Did Boris Johnson put his foot in it in France? Brexit, the border and 'alternative arrangements' Why is the Irish border blocking Brexit? And what is the backstop? UK Prime Minister Mr Johnson insists the backstop must be ditched if a no-deal exit from the EU on 31 October is to be avoided. He argues that it could leave the UK tied to the EU indefinitely, contrary to the result of the 2016 referendum, in which almost 52% of voters opted to leave. But the EU has repeatedly said the withdrawal deal negotiated by former PM Theresa May, which includes the backstop, cannot be renegotiated. However, it has previously said it would be willing to ""improve"" the political declaration - the document that sets out the UK's future relationship with the EU. The handshake between the PM and the president was warm and long-lasting. But it was the words that mattered. President Macron said that, while he had been portrayed as the ""hard boy"" of the EU, he was simply being clear about where he stood. He described the backstop both as an ""indispensable guarantee"" of ""stability in Ireland"" and the means of protecting the integrity of the European single market. But the expectation that he'd refuse point-blank to renegotiate the Brexit deal didn't materialise. Instead, he simply warned that any withdrawal agreement that the two sides might reach in the next month wouldn't be very different from the existing one. And he asked for more ""visibility"" from the UK on its alternative proposals. It would seem that both Mr Macron and Angela Merkel are determined not to shut the door entirely in Boris Johnson's face, and perhaps equally determined not to be blamed for no deal. Speaking after he greeted Mr Johnson at Paris's Elysee Palace, Mr Macron said he was ""very confident"" that the UK and EU would be able to find a solution within 30 days - a timetablesuggestedby Mrs Merkel - ""if there is a good will on both sides"". He said it would not be possible to find a new withdrawal agreement ""very different from the existing one"" within that time, but added that an answer could be reached ""without reshuffling"" the current deal. Mr Macron also denied that he was the ""hard boy in the band"", following suggestions that he would be tougher on the UK than his German counterpart. What is the withdrawal agreement? Brexit: A really simple guide UK 'cannot end freedom of movement' on Brexit day Standing beside Mr Macron, Mr Johnson said he had been ""powerfully encouraged"" by his conversations with Mrs Merkel in Berlin on Wednesday. He emphasised his desire for a deal with the EU but added that it was ""vital for trust in politics"" that the UK left the EU on 31 October. He also said that ""under no circumstances"" would the UK put checks or controls on the Ireland-UK border. The two leaders ate lunch, drank coffee and walked through the Elysee gardens together during their talks, which lasted just under two hours. Mr Johnson then left to fly back to the UK. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: French president ""quite right"" to say Irish backstop indispensable If implemented, the backstop would see Northern Ireland staying aligned to some rules of the EU single market, should the UK and the EU not agree a trade deal after Brexit. It would also see the UK stay in a single customs territory with the EU, and align with current and future EU rules on competition and state aid. These arrangements would apply until both the EU and UK agreed they were no longer necessary. Mrs Merkel has argued that the withdrawal agreement does not need to be reopened if a practical solution to the backstop crisis can be found. Brexit is due to happen on 31 October, with no deal being the default option. The prime minister has said he wants to leave the EU with a deal, but that the UK would be ready if none is reached.

Asked about Mr Macron's comments, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said he agreed there should not be a hard border on the island of Ireland.

Mr Corbyn has cancelled a trip to Ghana, urging MPs to meet him next week to discuss ways to prevent a no-deal Brexit.

"This video can not be played Would you notice if you crossed the Irish border? (Video from 2017) Prime Minister Boris Johnson insists ""there is a way"" to avoid checks along the Irish border after Brexit. But why has the Irish border remained a major sticking point in the Brexit negotiations? If Brexit happens, the 310-mile Irish border will represent the only land border between the UK and the EU. As well as no longer being in the EU, Northern Ireland is likely to end up with different rules and standards to its neighbour, the Republic of Ireland. That's because the UK intends to leave the customs union and single market - arrangements designed to make trade easier between EU countries. Lorries travelling to the EU from Northern Ireland would be required to stop at the border for document checks and some product inspections. This would be to ensure their goods meet EU standards. Following incidents likefoot-and-mouth disease,externaland thehorse meat scandal, the EU is very strict about these requirements. In theory, such checks would mean things like cameras and security posts, creating a so-called ""hard border"". Concerns have been raised that the return of a hard border couldjeopardise the Good Friday Agreement. This helped bring the period of violence in Northern Irelandknown as ""The Troubles""to an end. Boris Johnson says there are ""abundant"" technological solutions UK and EU Brexit negotiators came up with a solution - known as the Irish backstop - to avoid border checks. If used, the backstop would keep the UK in a very close relationship with the EU until a trade deal permanently avoiding the need for checks is agreed. However, the backstop proved unacceptable to many Conservative MPs, who feared the UK would be trapped in it indefinitely. Their opposition eventually led toTheresa May's resignation as prime minister. Boris Johnson, the new prime minister, said a revised Brexit deal must include ""the abolition of the backstop"". He says the current solution would mean ""signing away"" the UK's ""economic independence"". This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. A ""wealth of solutions"" including technology could replace the the backstop and avoid the need for a hard border, Boris Johnson said during the Tory leadership campaign. Supporters say custom checks could be done at warehouses before lorries set off. Mobile phone technology or microchips on lorries, would track goods and avoid the need for border posts. However, the EU does not currently share a single border with a non-EU country where checks have been completely eliminated. That includes Norway (not in the EU) and Sweden (an EU member) - which share one of the most technologically advanced borders in the world. Their main crossing point processes about 1,300 lorries a day, with each waiting 20 minutes on average. The EU has said it will consider other solutions to the Irish border problem, but only once the current Brexit deal has been signed off. It has also expressed doubts about a technological solution. The problem with just relying on technology, is that EU law also require some products to be physically checked - chemicals and food are among them. Single UK-Irish food zone suggested by report Border technology 'could take 10 years' Why are vets being recruited in Ireland? Alongside technology, Mr Johnson has also talked about a trusted trader scheme. Businesses would be allowed to by-pass checks once they've proven to be trustworthy and have met certain standards. For it to work, the UK would need to persuade the EU to recognise it. But setting up such a scheme would a take a lot of time and cost a lot of money. The UK would also need to come up with an effective way of enforcing it and prevent smuggling. Another solution that has been proposed is to allow agriculture checks to take place in""mobile units away from the border"".,external However, existing EU law states that animal checks must take place at designated Border Inspections Posts (BIPs)""in the immediate vicinity of the point of entry"",external- which would include the Irish border. The EU says ""geographic constraints"" are the only exception (eg mountains, cliffs, valleys, rivers). In these cases, ""a certain distance from the point of introduction may be tolerated."" So getting the EU to allow checks to take place away from the border, for non-geographic reasons, would require a change in the rules. DUP leader Arlene Foster also believes technology and other solutions can prevent a hard border after Brexit Mr Johnson has also suggested the idea ofan all-Ireland food standards zone. In other words, Northern Ireland would keep the same food and animal standards as the Republic of Ireland after Brexit. However, it's unclear how food and animal products would be separated from other trade in order to prevent smuggling. If smuggling was to occur, it could threaten the integrity of the single market. But some say the UK could go further and agree a Northern Ireland-only backstop. This would see Northern Ireland remain in the customs union and parts of the single market - eliminating the need for any cross-border checks. But the DUP, which supports the Conservatives in government, has previously rejected the idea of a Northern Ireland backstop on the basis it would create checks between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. No-one has started building border posts and the UK and Irish governments say they do not want a hard border. So there is a very real question, in the event of a no-deal Brexit, about who would actually install the border posts if the EU insist they're necessary.

"Simon Coveney said trade was a matter for the EU and the Irish government cannot come to a separate arrangement with the UK Ireland will not be entering into bilateral negotiations with the UK regarding no-deal Brexit planning, TÃ¡naiste (deputy Irish prime minister) Simon Coveney has said. Mr Coveney said trade policy was a matter for the European Union. He said the Irish government cannot come to a separate arrangement with the UK. The TÃ¡naiste also said it was realistic to expect a return of power-sharing before the 31 October Brexit deadline. Boris Johnson and the border blocking Brexit Brexit: What is the Irish border backstop Mr Coveney met Northern Ireland Secretary Julian Smith on Tuesday about Brexit andthe lack of government in Northern Ireland since January 2017. The TÃ¡naiste told Irish broadcaster RTÃ it was important that he developed a good personal relationship with Mr Smith that is based on trust. He added that commentary about the events in Northern Ireland over the past two weeks had become ""divisive and difficult"". Mr Coveney said it was not the case that the Irish government was refusing to talk to the UK, but said he would not be facilitating the UK in walking away from commitments in the withdrawal agreement. ""We are not in the business of facilitating the UK moving away from commitments that they've made to Ireland and the EU to protect the Good Friday Agreement, to protect an all-island economy, which is a commitment that they have made, and to replace that with some sort of makeshift deal in the weeks before a no-deal,"" he said. ""Instead what we have been doing for over a year now, is we have been planning for contingency in the context of a no-deal Brexit should that happen.""
