"Congratulations to Wolf Alice on winning this year's Mercury Prize. The London four-piece band picked up the Â£25,000 winners' cheque for their 2017 album, Visions of A Life, which will be familiar to their fans and pop music aficionados (it reached No 2 in the charts) but probably less so to others. Any which way, it is well worth a listen. The Mercury Prize judges have chosen an album that is adventurous in regards to the band's own sonic development but not exactly avant-garde in terms of pop music. Joff Oddie, Ellie Rowsell, Theo Ellis and Joel Amey of Wolf Alice celebrating their award Wolf Alice are purveyors of classic indie pop but with the added twist of being refreshingly willing to test their musical boundaries. Visions of A Life is like one of those Robert Rauschenberg collages that are constructed out of bits and pieces he'd picked up along the way. It seems to be all over the place at first: a mixtape from a band that hasn't made up its mind as to who or what it is. But then, gradually, it resolves into a coherent design with a heart and soul. Visions of A Life is like a Robert Rauschenberg collage (Black Market 1961) It opens with Heavenward, a grungy track about death in which lead singer Ellie Rowsell channels a young Thom Yorke. It is followed by the shouty Yuk Foo, in which the band make an unconvincing stab at being punks. The third track, Beautifully Unconventional, is different again: a catchy tune that harks back to the late-70s, early-80s scene and the likes of Siouxsie and the Banshees. The Mercury Prize judges described the album as ""an exuberant tapestry of swirling pop, grunge and indie guitar rock"". Wolf Alice's Visions Of A Life album cover Fair enough, not much to argue with there. Except, there's a word missing. As you make your way through the album, and listen to track after track, each and every one making you think, ""That's a bit like such-and-such artistâ¦,"" you start to wonder what is distinctive about Wolf Alice? What is their sound? It's not immediately obvious. There's a heaviness and speed that they create around their songs, which gives them a brooding storminess upon which Rowsell's ethereal voice rises and falls on a sea of driving guitars and pulsating baselines. There are tracks, such as Don't Delete the Kisses and St. Purple & Green, where the combination of rock, pop, and lyrical poetry come together to create a genuinely soulful, gothic landscape. This is their sound. But without that missing word, which isâ¦ Folk. It is how the band started out with Ellie Rowsell and Joff Oddie playing clubs and bars around north London as an acoustic duo with a Laura Marling-type vibe. They expanded to become a four piece with the intention of being faster and noisier, which they have done, but the folkiness remains, albeit buried deep within an indie wall of sound. Folk is the grit in the Wolf Alice oyster - it agitates and irritates and rubs up against the band's indie rock public image, but ultimately leads to the creation of some beautifully formed musical pearls. Ellie Rowsell from Wolf Alice performing Don't Delete The Kisses at the Mercury Prize Visions of A Life is the band's second studio album. Their first, My Love is Cool, was very good, and that - as we know - often leads to a tricky second. Not so in this case. Visions of A Life is better, from its eight-minute long title track to the hauntingly melancholic After The Zero Hour. The band's experimentation necessarily means not every idea hits the bullseye, but Wolf Alice have established themselves as artists of rare quality who have already made their mark. My guess is the third album will be better still, with more surprises, more avenues explored, which will lead to an even more ""exuberant tapestry of swirling pop, grunge and indie guitar rock"". And folk.

"Graham Benbow was given a six-month sentence, suspended for two years A teacher who drove at a Manchester Airport parking official in a row over drop-off costs has been spared jail by a judge who said the fee was ""unjust"". Graham Benbow, 55, of Stockton Heath, was given a six-month suspended sentence after admitting dangerous driving at Manchester Crown Court. Judge Bernard Lever described the drop-off fees as an ""absolute disgrace"". Manchester Airport said the judge was ""irresponsible"" and the outcome showed ""complete disregard"" for its staff. The court heard the parking attendant ended up on the car bonnet and was driven along a road for several hundred yards when he tried to stop Benbow leaving. Benbow had refused to pay the fee - Â£3 for five minutes or Â£4 for 10 minutes - and said there were no clear signs indicating that he should. He reversed his car to look at the signs but then drove towards one of the barriers when he noticed it was open. The staff member placed himself against the barrier to stop him, but Benbow continued, the prosecution said. Anger as airport reveals drop-off charges Airport axes free 'kiss and fly' scheme Crackdown on rogue airport parking firms The employee ended up on the bonnet and Benbow drove with him over a roundabout and stopped just before the motorway, the court heard. Although unhurt, the complainant said he had ""feared for his life"". The row happened on 23 July, less than two weeks aftercharges were introduced. Judge Bernard Lever said the incident was ""totally out of character"" The judge said it was ""no excuse"" for dangerous driving but he thought it was an ""absolute disgrace that people cannot deliver people to airports without paying an extraordinary amount"". ""Whilst I am 100% against your behaviour and losing self control, I am 100% against the airport behaving in this manner against people who have no or little choice at dropping their families at the airport in this way,"" he said. The judge continued: ""I have to make it clear to everyone that they must not lose their temper. That does not detract from the fact that this was very dangerous driving and what you did was very reckless and dangerous."" The sentence for Benbow, who works at Altrincham Grammar School for Girls, was suspended for two years. A spokesman for the airport said it was ""deeply concerned"". ""Anyone who has experienced an attack of this nature would be appalled by the judge's comments and attitude towards determining a suitable punishment for criminal driving,"" he said.

"A picture of Alex King and Anna Shapiro, posted on Ms Shapiro's Instagram account in 2015 A woman taken to a hospital amid fears she had been exposed to the nerve agent Novichok in Salisbury has insisted her concern was genuine and it was no hoax. Anna Shapiro and her husband Alex Kingsparked a major incidentwhen they said they had become ill at a Prezzo restaurant in the city on Sunday. They were later discharged from hospital and police said one line of inquiry was that it had been a hoax. Ms Shapiro's lawyers said labelling it a hoax was ""media speculation"". On Tuesday, Ms Shapiro, 30, told the Sun newspaper that the Russian state had poisoned her and her husband in the restaurant. The paper reported that ""security sources"" suspected a ""rat poison attack"". Ms Shapiro - a model and Israeli citizen of Russian heritage - and Mr King were later discharged from Salisbury District Hospital after the pair tested negative for Novichok. A police source told the BBC they were looking into whether it had been a hoax. The pair have been interviewed by Wiltshire Police and no arrests have been made. Ms Shapiro's lawyers said: ""There has been some media speculation that our client may have participated in an elaborate hoax as regards her fear of her husband's poisoning. ""She was not involved in any hoax and... her fears were genuine, both as to the poisoning and her suspicion of foul play."" In 2006, Mr King carried out a ""prank"" on the Prince of Wales at a film premiere. He inserted himself into an official line-up of stars being greeted by Prince Charles and was later interviewed by the media about his deception. He claimed the had done itas part of a Â£100,000 bet with his employer,external- the convicted fraudster Edward Davenport. He also has a previous conviction for distributing indecent photographs or pseudo-photographs of children. A major incident was declared in Salisbury on Sunday, after Ms Shapiro and Mr King said they had fallen ill Russian ex-spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yuliacollapsed in Salisburyin March after being exposed to Novichok. After weeks in hospital they were released but in June, two Amesbury residents fell ill after being exposed to the same nerve agent. Dawn Sturgess, 44,later died. The UK government has accused two Russian men, Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov, of attempting to kill the Skripals. But in an interview on a Russian state-run news channel, they claimed to have been in Salisbury only as tourists. Russia has denied any involvement in the poisoning.

"This video can not be played Taylor (not their real name) was groomed on Kik at the age of 13 One teen chat app has featured in more than 1,100 child sexual abuse cases in the last five years, the BBC has found. Of 29 police forces that supplied information to the BBC, all but one had child exploitation cases involving Kik. Police say they are frustrated with Kik's response, with one detective saying getting information out of the firm was a ""bureaucratic nightmare"". Kik said it was ""constantly assessing and improving its trust and safety measures"". A BBC Freedom of Information request sent to all 47 police forces in the UK revealed there had been 1,147 investigations by 28 forces into offences of child sexual exploitation, grooming and image offences involving the app. Eighteen forces failed to supply any information. Founded in 2009, Canada-based Kik claims 300 million users worldwide access its free instant messaging service. It is popular with teenagers, has many anonymous accounts and is easy to sign up for using false details. Constable Jason Cullum from Northamptonshire Police's paedophile online investigation team told the BBC delays due to the ""bureaucratic nightmare"" of obtaining information from the company put children at further risk. He is investigating a complex grooming case involving more than 90 profiles - some suspected offenders, others child victims - but he needs information from Kik to identify and trace them. Police officers contacting Kik are given an automated response and directed via a complex legal process - under the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) - to gain a court order. ""It's incredibly frustrating. We're banging our heads against a brick wall,"" said PC Cullum. ""There's a child that's going to be abused for probably another 12 months before we know who that is."" Canada and the US have strict rules on releasing personal information to law enforcement agencies to protect individuals' privacy. Kik says it will release some information if there is an ""imminent threat of death or serious physical injury to any person"". In these cases, the app will release ""limited basic subscriber data"". Home Secretary Sajid Javid hasthreatened to take action against tech companiesif they do not help to tackle online child abuse. ""The threat has evolved a lot more quickly than the industry's response and industry has just not kept up,"" he said. ""So let me say this - I'm not just asking for change, I am demanding it."" Taylor was a lonely and vulnerable 13-year-old when the abuse began on Kik. ""It started with a lot of selfies... but it would escalate to underwear photos... naked photos, then videos."" Taylor told the BBC that more than 100 men, possibly 200, made contact through the app. Taylor criticised Kik for not doing more to protect vulnerable users. ""It's all going on behind closed doors, they can see it but they're not doing anything about it. That's what upsets me."" In a statement, Kik told the BBC: ""We take online safety very seriously, and we're constantly assessing and improving our trust and safety measures."" It said it will continue to ""provide resources to parents and strengthen relationships with law enforcement and safety-focused organisations"". But PC Cullum said he was not reassured and that abused children remained at risk. He said: ""In this day and age I should be able to identify everyone, but I can't.""

"The Enigma machine scrambled messages to make them much harder to decipher Computer historians have staged a re-enactment of World War Two code-cracking at Bletchley Park. A replica code-breaking computer called a Bombe was used to decipher a message scrambled by an Enigma machine. Held at the National Museum of Computing (TNMOC), the event honoured Polish help with wartime code-cracking. Ruth Bourne, a former wartime code-cracker who worked at Bletchley and used the original Bombes, oversaw the modern effort. Enigma machines were used extensively by the German army and navy during World War Two. This  prompted a massive effort by the Allies to crack the complex method they employed to scramble messages. That effort was co-ordinated via Bletchley Park and resulted in the creation of the Bombe, said Paul Kellar who helps to keep a replica machine running at the museum. Renowned mathematician Alan Turing was instrumental in the creation of the original Bombe. ""During the war, they had about 200 Bombes,"" said Mr Kellar. ""It was a real code-breaking factory."" For its re-enactment, TNMOC recruited a team of 12 and used a replica Bombe that, until recently, had been on display at the Bletchley Park museum next door. The electro-mechanical Bombe was designed to discover which settings the German Enigma operators used to scramble their messages. The Bombe was used to work out Enigma machine settings to help read German communications As with World War Two messages, the TNMOC team began with a hint or educated guess about the content of the message, known as a ""crib"", which was used to set up the Bombe. The machine then cranked through the millions of possible combinations until it came to a ""good stop"", said Mr Kellar. This indicated that the Bombe had found key portions of the settings used to turn readable German into gobbledygook. After that, said Mr Kellar, it was just a matter of time before the 12-strong team cracked the message. Ms Bourne, who worked at Bletchley, said authentic methods had been used by the modern code-breakers but the effort lacked the over-riding stress and tension that accompanied the wartime work. ""During the war, there was a feeling of great pressure because the Enigma [encryption] keys changed at midnight so everyone was pushing to get enough information before it went out of date,"" she told the BBC. ""The only high spot was when your machine happened to find the 'good stop' and you felt pleased about that,"" she said. Work on cracking the Engima machine was greatly aided by Polish cryptographers, said Mr Kellar. Friday's event commemorated 80 years since that information was shared with the Allies. In addition, he said, the early stages of the code-cracking re-enactment were broadcast live to a Polish supercomputer conference in Poznan.

"Social care workers are some of those most likely to be underpaid A record Â£15.6m worth of underpayment to UK workers has been discovered by the government in the past year. In total, 200,000 workers missed out on being paid at least the minimum wage rate - the highest number since the statutory rate was introduced in 1999. Social care, commercial warehousing and the gig economy were the sectors most likely to underpay staff, HMRC said. It had prioritised checking these areas alongside apprentices, migrant workers and employment agencies, it said. In total, the firms found to have underpaid workers were fined Â£14m as well as having to reimburse their staff. The Low Pay Commission chairman Bryan Sanderson said: ""All workers are entitled to be paid at least the minimum wage, so it is good to see increased focus on enforcement bearing fruit and securing more arrears for more workers."" The government said funding for enforcement was at record levels - rising to Â£26.3m in 2018/19 from Â£20m in 2016/17. Earlier this year,restaurant chains Wagamama and TGI Fridays were finedan undisclosed amount for failing to pay staff the national minimum wage. Lowest-paid 'can't afford basic needs' Wagamama fined for minimum wage failure The UK cities with the highest and lowest wages The National Living Wage (over 25s): Â£7.83 an hour 21-24 year old rate: Â£7.38 18-20: Â£5.90 16-17 Â£4.20 Apprentice rate: Â£3.70 Business minister Kelly Tolhurst urged firms to check that they were getting their workers' pay right. ""We are dedicated to stopping underpayment of the minimum wage. Employers must recognise their responsibilities and pay their workers the money they are entitled to,"" she said. She credited the rise in the number of underpaid workers discovered to ""a record government clampdown"". Tom Neil, of employment advice and conciliation service Acas, said firms which did not pay the national minimum wage were ""breaking the law"" and faced a maximum fine of Â£20,000 per worker. ""Failure to pay the national living wage could also result in a company director being banned for up to 15 years,"" he added. Research from the TUC union has previously suggested that the number of workers not paid the full minimum wage is about 250,000. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) has estimated that as many as 362,000 people do not receive the headline rate of the minimum wage. However, that includes workers whose pay is below the minimum wage for legitimate reasons: for example, they may receive accommodation or other benefits as part of their pay. HMRC urged workers who believed they were not receiving the minimum wage to contact the Acas helpline on 0300 123 1100 in confidence or submit an online query through its complaints form.

"Harry Uzoka was stabbed in the heart after a row with a fellow model George Koh Three men have been jailed for killing a model in a row over his girlfriend. Harry Uzoka, 25, was stabbed in the heart by fellow model George Koh in west London in January after he went to settle the dispute. Koh, convicted of murder at the Old Bailey in August, was given a life sentence with a minimum of 25 years. Merse Dikanda was also found guilty of murder and jailed for at least 22 years, and Jonathan Okigbo was given a 14-year sentence for manslaughter. Although initially friendly, the relationship between Mr Uzoka and Koh deteriorated after Koh claimed to have had sex with Mr Uzoka's girlfriend Ruby Campbell, who is also a model. The pair then exchanged angry text messages and arranged to gather some friends and meet up in Shepherd's Bush for a fight. (L_R) George Koh, Merse Dikanda and Jonathan Okigbo were jailed at the Old Bailey Koh, Dikanda and Okigbo, all 24, took at least three knives - including a machete - with them to the rendezvous. Mr Uzoka recruited his flatmate Adrian Harper and they armed themselves with dumbbell bars. Mr Harper told the jury he was ""expecting a fist fight"". But he said when he saw his friend again Mr Uzoka said ""I've been stabbed,"" and collapsed in the road. Remembering Harry Uzoka Murdered model's girlfriend 'threatened' Three guilty of killing London model Mr Uzoka was signed with London's Premier Model Management agency and counted catwalk star Jourdan Dunn among his friends. Judge Wendy Joseph QC said he had enjoyed helping others, including Koh. She described Koh's behaviour as swinging ""between excessive admiration and spite"". The judge added: ""This manifested itself in several ways. Sometimes Koh would claim to look very like Harry and tried to imitate his style of dress. At other times he contacted Harry's Instagram friends, falsely speaking ill of them."" This video can not be played CCTV of the attack shows Dikanda wiping a blade clean on his trousers The judge went on to say that while the loss of any life was tragic, it was all the more so ""when a victim is so young, able and generous"". She described Mr Uzoka as a young man ""who overcame his own difficulties to make a great success of his young life and to be a remarkable role model for others"". ""He had, with great talent, forged a successful international career as a male model. He was one of the first black British men to do so."" In a statement read to the court, Mr Uzoka's mother said her son's death was ""yet another senseless killing"". ""Our lives changed forever when I got that phone call. His death has left a gaping hole, a void and crack in our family. ""The trauma has affected us emotionally and financially, he was an inspiration to all, a beautiful boy who will never be forgotten. We still find it difficult to believe he is actually gone."" The judge also highlighted the impact of the murder on the wider community, saying children were becoming afraid of going out and parents ""are thinking of buying their sons stab-proof vests"".

"Brett Kavanaugh denies the allegations by Christine Blasey Ford President Donald Trump has challenged the woman who has accused his Supreme Court nominee of sexual assault, demanding she provide evidence. Mr Trump questioned why law enforcement was not called at the time of the alleged assault, in 1982, if it was ""as bad as she says"". The nomination of Brett Kavanaugh has been held up while the allegations of Christine Blasey Ford are assessed. Both have agreed to testify before a Senate committee. However, Prof Ford has set out conditions for her appearance which have yet to be agreed by the Senate Judiciary Committee. US media report that the panel has now offered to hold the hearing next Wednesday. This video can not be played Why it can take sexual assault allegations years to come out This counteroffer reportedly requires Prof Ford to testify before Judge Kavanaugh, which goes against one of her conditions. The committee must approve the nomination before it passes to the full Senate for a vote. The truth about false assault accusations Kavanaugh accuser 'faces death threats' Could Kavanaugh confirmation be derailed? The choice of a new justice for the Supreme Court is pivotal, as it often gives the final word on highly contentious laws and its nine judges have an immense impact on US public life. In a series of tweets, the president again delivered his full support for Judge Kavanaugh, saying he was a ""fine man, with an impeccable reputation"". He went on: ""I have no doubt that, if the attack on Dr Ford was as bad as she says, charges would have been immediately filed with local Law Enforcement Authorities by either her or her loving parents. I ask that she bring those filings forward so that we can learn date, time, and place!"" He added: ""Why didn't someone call the FBI 36 years ago?"" Mr Trump also attacked ""radical left wing politicians who don't want to know the answers, they just want to destroy and delay"". Allow Twitter content?

Following the president's controversial comments, the hashtag #WhyIDidntReport began trending on Twitter, with thousands sharing personal stories of sexual harassment and assault. By Friday afternoon, the hashtag had over 122,000 tweets from both women and men. President Trump had also weighed in on the process on Thursday, telling Fox News: ""I don't think you can delay it any longer. They've delayed it a week already... they have to get on with it."" The Senate Judiciary Committee vote on Judge Kavanaugh had originally been scheduled for Thursday of this week. The details of the alleged assault during a gathering of teenagers at a house in Montgomery County, Maryland,were carried in the Washington Post,externallast Sunday when Prof Ford decided to go public. She told the newspaper that she discussed the alleged assault in 2012 when she attended couples therapy with her husband. The psychology professor at Palo Alto University in California said she was being treated for what she said had been the long-term effects of the incident. She told a senior Democratic lawmaker of her allegation in a confidential letter this summer and only consented to be named after it was leaked. Judge Kavanaugh has repeatedly denied the claim. Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC North America reporter Donald Trump, much to the reported surprise of some in the White House, had largely held his tongue about the twists in the Brett Kavanaugh nomination. That ended on Friday morning. With his nominee in peril - the level of danger seems to vary by the hour - the president has now jumped into the debate with both feet. His suggestion that ""loving"" parents would have reported an alleged sexual assault to the police and implication that the incident may or may not be ""as bad as she says"" are exactly the kind of inflammatory statement some Republicans feared the president would feel drawn to make. The president's comments will almost certainly help rally his base to Judge Kavanaugh's defence. It could also damage support for the nomination - already fairly low - among women and independents who could cast key votes in the upcoming mid-term elections. In the end, however, what matters most for Judge Kavanaugh's fate is how Mr Trump's involvement affects Republican support in the Senate. The confirmation process is already hopelessly politicised, as Republicans accuse Democrats of bad-faith delay tactics and Democrats renew their call for a wider hearing process. The only thing that seems clear is that the process will get nastier before it's all over. Whatdoes the committee say? Committee chairman Chuck Grassley had called for written testimony by this Friday from Prof Ford and scheduled a hearing on the matter for Monday. Her lawyer, Debra Katz, rejected this and in a phone call to the panel on Thursday spelled out her client's conditions for testifying. They include: Prof Ford will not testify if Judge Kavanaugh is in the room Judge Kavanaugh must testify first There can be no appearance before next Thursday Questions to be posed preferably by senators and not outside counsel Mark Judge, who was said to have been a witness to the alleged assault, should be subpoenaed to appear Agrees to a public hearing but wants limits on the media coverage There are problems with at least three of the requests. The Senate Judiciary Committee would have to change the Monday hearing. It is also not traditional for the accused to testify first and not have an opportunity for rebuttal. White House adviser Kellyanne Conway said: ""Asking for that usual sequence to be reversed is very unusual."" Why is the US top court so important?? Meet the Supremes - who are the justices? Neither is it traditional for any subpoenas to be issued for the nomination process. However, Ms Katz suggested there appeared to be room for negotiation when she sent a letter to the committee after the phone call, saying: ""The only issue I said was a deal breaker was that Dr Ford cannot appear at a hearing on Monday."" Prof Ford, Judge Kavanaugh and his wife have all been receiving threats, as the case becomes increasingly contentious. Ms Katz said of her client: ""She's been receiving death threats which have been reported to the FBI and she and her family have been forced out of their home."" This video can not be played Alumni of Ford's school: ""We believe her"" Fox News said it had obtained emails showing graphic and violent threats,externalto Ashley Kavanaugh, who married the judge in 2004. But supporters of both Judge Kavanaugh and Prof Ford have also been vocal. A group of friends and former colleagues of the judge held a press briefing on Friday behind the banner #IStandWithBrett. Maura Fitzgerald, a friend since high school, said: ""The allegation against Brett is inconsistent with everything that I have known about him as a person."" Twelve of Prof Ford's family members have written an open letter, posted on Twitter, in which they call her ""highly ethical"", adding that ""her honesty is above reproach"". ""Chrissy is not someone who chooses to be in the spotlight,"" the letter said.

"Aaron and Jasper are declining in popularity but Nigel is making a comeback of sorts Hunter and Aurora have joined the top 100 names for baby boys and girls in England and Wales, according to official statistics. Oliver and Olivia remain the most popular names, positions they have held since 2013 and 2016 respectively. New entries into the top 100 boys' names in 2017 also included Ralph, while Aaron and Jasper fell out of the top 100. New entries for girls included Orla, Edith, Bonnie, Lyla and Hallie. These replaced Lexi, Zoe, Maddison, Sarah, Felicity and Lydia. 'Hardly anyone calls babies my name' A modern browser with JavaScript and a stable internet connection is required to view this interactive. If you cannot see the baby names tracker,click to launch the interactive content,external. Nigel is making a comeback of sorts, with 11 baby boys given that name in 2017. The name was thought to be almost extinct afterfewer than three babies were named Nigel the year before. It is the first time Hunter has been in the top 100 boys' names since records began in 1904. There were 841 babies given the name, making it the 78th most popular in England and Wales. Ralph was last in the top 100 in 1944. In 2017 it was the 98th most popular and chosen for 669 boys. Aurora joined the girls' top 100 at number 80. Results were based on names given from an analysis of 679,106 babies born in 2017,the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said,external. If you cannot see this graphic produced by the Office for National Statistics,click to launch the interactive content,external. Number of children given a particular spelling of a name in 2017: Boys Oliver - 6,259 Harry - 5,031 George - 4,929 Noah - 4,273 Jack - 4,190 Jacob - 3,968 Leo - 3,781 Oscar - 3,739 Charlie - 3,724 Muhammad - 3,691 Girls Olivia - 5,204 Amelia - 4,358 Isla - 3,373 Ava - 3,289 Emily - 3,121 Isabella - 2,627 Mia - 2,590 Poppy - 2,527 Ella - 2,452 Lily - 2,405 The popularity of names varies across England with Muhammad more popular that Oliver in three regions The ONS only provides figures when there were at least three babies given the same spelling of a name. It does not reveal names taken by only one or two babies to protect their privacy. It means the name Siri has sometimes dropped off the list completely but appeared again in 2017 as three people gave their daughters the same name as Apple's ""intelligent assistant"". There were also 301 girls named Alexa, the name that triggers Amazon's Echo smart speaker. Chris Evans reveals names of baby twins The baby who was the only Nigel Christine Lampard has baby girl Regionally, Olivia was the most popular girls' name throughout England and Wales, but Muhammad was more popular than Oliver in London, the West Midlands and Yorkshire and the Humber. The Duchess of Sussex's name Meghan is seeing a rise in popularity, while Harry remains a firm favourite Harry was the most popular boys' name in north-east England and second most popular overall. Megan has fallen 17 places on 2016, but the so-called ""Markle Sparkle"" might be behind the rise of the alternative spelling of Meghan. There were 49 baby girls given the name in 2017. Whether the 2018 royal wedding gives Meghan a further boost will be revealed next year. There were dozens of children named Bowie but did David inspire their parents? David Bowie may have inspired parents to name their children in tribute. The number of children named Bowie has risen since 2016,the year he died of cancer. There were 38 boys and six girls with the name in 2017 and 35 boys and seven girls in 2016. That compares with 12 boys and fewer than three girls the year before. The rankings are based on names with the exact same spellings. That means the 76 baby girls called Khaleesi, after the word for a queen invented for the character Daenerys Targaryen in Game of Thrones, are recorded separately to the four girls called Kaleesi. Muhammad (3,691 boys) and Mohammed (1,982) combined would still not be more popular than the traditional spelling of Oliver. However there are other variations on the name, such as Mohammad (837), Mohamed (269) and Muhammed (450) that would make it more popular if they were all counted as the same name. Nick Stripe from the ONS said: ""Although Oliver and Olivia remained the most popular baby names in 2017, some fascinating changes took place beneath them. ""Leo entered the boys' top 10 for the first time, whilst Hunter rocketed into the top 100, also for the first time, reaching number 78. Sarah, the most popular name for baby girls throughout much of the 1970s and 1980s, dropped out of the top 100 for the first time since our records began in 1904. ""Brand new entries into the top 100 for girls include the names Aurora and Hallie."" Sarah-Jane âLjungstrom from parenting website Channelmum.com, said the rise of Aurora and Hallie was down to people looking for ""heavenly"" names. ""The Instagram effect is starting to shine through with dreamy space names for girls the stand-out new trend,"" she said. ""Also still growing for girls is the botanicals theme. Poppy is up five places into the top ten, while Daisy, Ivy, Willow and Iris are all big climbers too. ""For boys, millennial parents are leading the way with the 'soft macho' phenomenon. Instead of traditional short, sharp masculine names like Jake and Tyler which have plunged in popularity, the 'soft macho' trend is seeing manly but gentle names including Hunter, Leo and Ralph all picked hundreds of times last year."" Olivia and Jack remain the most popular babynames in Scotland, according to data published in March, while Emily and James were revealed in August to be the most popularnames in Northern Ireland.

"Fatima Khan said she was ashamed of the video she made of Khalid Safi's dying moments A woman who filmed her boyfriend dying in a pool of blood and put the video on social media has been jailed for 14 years. Fatima Khan, 21, dubbed a ""Snapchat queen"", plotted with a love rival to kill Khalid Safi, 18, who she had been seeing for two years. Mr Safi was repeatedly stabbed in the chest by Raza Khan in North Acton, London, in December 2016, jurors heard. Khan was convicted of manslaughter after a trial at the Old Bailey. Mr Khan remains on the run, the Met Police said on Friday. Khan, described by her own defence barrister as ""Ilford's Snapchat queen"", filmed Mr Safi as he lay dying in the street and posted it on the picture-sharing app alongside an offensive message. She wept uncontrollably as Judge Michael Topolski QC jailed her and said she had acted in a ""cold and callous and despicable way"". The judge said her ""disrespect for Khalid reached new and inhuman depths when in an act of grotesque contempt for him you calmly walked towards him as he lay dying"". ""You filmed him in the process of dying and take a still picture of him all of which which you sent with that chilling message to all your Snapchat friends."" Khalid Safi was stabbed to death in December 2016 As with all Snapchat videos, the pictures would have been automatically deleted within 24 hours. However, one of the group of friends who followed her online posts filmed the message which was used as key evidence in her trial. Khan had denied murdering Mr Safi, saying she was ""ashamed"" of the video. A jury cleared her of murder by joint enterprise but found her guilty of the alternative charge of manslaughter. The 'Snapchat queen' who filmed her boyfriend's death 'Snapchat queen' killed boyfriend The court heard Mr Khan was ""a rival for her affections"" and Khan arranged for him to kill Mr Safi. On the day of the killing, Mr Safi and Khan had gone to a Costa Coffee near to her work at Vigilant Security in North Acton. Mr Khan then arrived in a minicab and walked up to the couple, holding a large knife. Mr Safi produced a screwdriver and the pair fought for about 15 seconds before the victim was fatally wounded, the court heard. Raza Khan is wanted for the murder of Khalid Safi In mitigation at the sentencing hearing, Kerim Fuad QC said Khan had a ""pathological obsession"" with her mobile phone and the Snapchat app. ""It's become an increasingly worrying aspect of society that these devices are playing such a prominent role,"" he added. Mr Fuad described Khan as an ""attention-seeking princess"". The court heard she had previous convictions for assault, shoplifting and fraud dating back to when she was aged 14. Latest news and stories from London Det Ch Insp Mark Cranwell reiterated the Met's appeal for information to help find Mr Khan, who is wanted for Mr Safi's murder. He added: ""A petty argument over rival affections has escalated with a tragic outcome. If you know where [Raza] Khan is, I'd urge you to do the right thing and contact the police.""

"Wet age-related macular degeneration affects around 26,000 people in the UK A landmark ruling against two leading drug companies could save the NHS in England ""hundreds of millions"" a year. Novartis and Bayer were trying to stop NHS doctors from prescribing a cheaper treatment for a serious eye condition. Health bosses said the judgement in the High Court may reduce the power of companies to set prices. Drug company Novartis said they were ""disappointed"" because patients were being asked to accept an unlicensed treatment to save the NHS money. The case centred on the treatment of patients with the common eye condition, wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Twelve NHS bodies in the north east of England were offering these patients Avastin, a cheaper alternative to the licensed drug, Lucentis. David Hambleton, chief executive officer of NHS South Tyneside clinical commissioning group (CCG), one of the NHS groups involved in the case, welcomed the judgment, saying it was a good day for patients and the NHS. ""We've always said we think that it's important that patients should have the choice of a very effective treatment for wet AMD, and it's actually a fraction of the cost of the other alternatives. ""So I think what we do now is offer patients that choice. We believe that they will support very strongly having a cost-effective, safe treatment and saving the NHS generally a lot of money. It is a victory for common sense over commercial interests."" The 10-year fight to offer a cheaper drug The case was brought by pharmaceutical giants Bayer and Novartis against twelve NHS CCGs in the north of England. The NHS groups were offering patients a choice between Lucentis and Eylea - drugs licensed for eye treatment - and the far cheaper drug Avastin, which is recommended by the World Health Organisation (WHO) for treating eyes, but only licensed for cancer treatment in the UK. Novartis and Bayer manufacture the two more expensive licensed drugs - Lucentis which costs Â£561 and Eylea which costs Â£800. By comparison, Avastin costs about Â£28 per injection. Avastin is widely used around the world, particularly in the US. In January, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) concluded that Avastin was as safe and effective as the two licensed drugs, Lucentis and Eylea. Mike Burdon, President of the Royal College of Ophthalmologists said: ""Licensing laws are designed to protect patients from poorly regulated unproven drugs, but it is the drug companies' responsibility to apply for a licence. ""We are treating 40,000 new diagnoses of wet AMD annually - the saving could amount to Â£500m a year. This amounts to one district hospital being built annually."" Wet AMD can be treated with injections Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is an eye condition that affects more than 600,000 people, 40,000 of those suffer from wet AMD It causes people to lose central vision, usually in both eyes It is more common with age and there are two main types - wet AMD and dry AMD Reading becomes more difficult, colours appear less vibrant and faces can be hard to recognise Wet AMD develops when abnormal blood vessels form and damage the cells at the back of the eye Wet AMD can be treated if caught early. Drugs are injected into the eye to stop the growth of the abnormal blood vessels Legal threat over cheaper eye drug NHS 'must step in' over Avastin row NHS 'should use cancer drug for eyes' David Hambleton, of NHS South Tyneside CCG, said the ruling would result in a rethink for NICE and the MHRA, the UK's drug regulatory body. ""I think at least we've got some real legal clarity now, so both of the bodies - NICE and the MHRA - will need need to look at what their guidance says. ""Now they have the option of allowing the use of so-called 'off-label' drugs."" Responding to the ruling, a spokesperson from pharmaceutical company Novartis said:  ""Novartis is deeply disappointed in this decision and remains of the opinion that the policy undermines the well-established legal and regulatory framework that is there to protect both patients' safety and to ensure health care professionals can prescribe with confidence."" Dr Sheuli Porkess, Deputy Chief Scientific Advisor to The Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI) said: ""This extraordinary judgement potentially undermines the regulation of all medicines and by doing that, neither patients nor doctors have clarity on what information to trust.""

"Rod Rosenstein: ""There is no basis to invoke the 25th amendment"" US Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein has denied a report that he discussed invoking a constitutional clause to oust President Donald Trump. America's second most senior law official said the allegation was ""inaccurate and factually incorrect"". The New York Times, citing anonymous sources,external, also said Mr Rosenstein had suggested secretly recording Mr Trump to expose chaos in the White House. But a source told the BBC that the comment was sarcastic. Mr Rosenstein is reported to have made the remarks after Mr Trump fired the FBI director last year. James Comey had been overseeing his law enforcement agency's investigation into alleged ties between the Trump campaign and Russia. Mr Trump referred to the ""Russia thing"" when asked why he was removed. Mr Trump told a rally in Missouri on Friday evening that there was a ""lingering stench"" about what was being exposed at the US Justice Department. He said he would get rid of it just as his administration ""had gotten rid of bad people at the FBI"". This video can not be played The 25th Amendment: Could it be used to unseat Trump? The New York Times reported that Mr Rosenstein had discussed recruiting cabinet members to invoke the 25th amendment of the US constitution, which provides for the removal of a president if he is deemed unfit for office. It also says he suggested secretly recording Mr Trump to expose White House turmoil and dysfunction. The suggestions came during meetings and conversations in May 2017 with Department of Justice and FBI officials, the paper said. It cited several unnamed sources who were briefed on the events. According to US media, the source of the allegations are memos created by former FBI acting director Andrew McCabe, who was fired by Mr Trump in March this year. Mr Trump and Mr Rosenstein speak at an immigration event in May Mr McCabe's lawyer, Michael Bromwich, said his client ""has no knowledge of how any member of the media obtained those memos"". Mr Bromwich said the memos had been submitted to the special counsel who is investigating possible Russian meddling in the 2016 election and obstruction of justice, and that another copy had remained with the FBI. The deputy attorney general issued a statement saying: ""The New York Times's story is inaccurate and factually incorrect. ""I will not further comment on a story based on anonymous sources who are obviously biased against the department and are advancing their own personal agenda. ""But let me be clear about this: Based on my personal dealings with the president, there is no basis to invoke the 25th amendment."" From left: Mr Rosenstein, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, and Mr McCabe A justice department press officer told the BBC that Mr Rosenstein's comment about secretly recording the president was a joke. The statement was attributed to ""a source who was in the room"" and was said to remember the exchange in question. ""The statement was sarcastic and was never discussed with any intention of recording a conversation with the president,"" the unnamed source said. The spokesperson did not immediately reply to an emailed question asking if the 25th amendment was discussed during that meeting. In other US media, there was scepticism that the US deputy attorney general would earnestly propose ousting the president. Activating the relevant section of the 25th amendment would require a majority of Mr Trump's cabinet, the vice-president and majorities in Congress, which is currently controlled by the president's party. The Washington Post also reported,externalthat Mr Rosenstein's remark about surreptitious recordings was not serious. The newspaper said the deputy attorney general had been responding to Andrew McCabe's suggestion that the justice department investigate the president. According to the Post, Mr Rosenstein replied sarcastically: ""What do you want to do, Andy, wire the president?"" The newspaper also said that someone who was present at the meeting denied the 25th amendment had ever come up. Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC Washington Donald Trump has spent a lot of time disparaging ""fake news"" reports from the ""failing"" New York Times largely based on anonymous sources. It will be interesting to see how he responds to an article that seemingly confirms his suspicions that members of his own administration are out to get him. Or maybe they're not. It all depends on whether you believe sources who talked to people who were in the room when Rod Rosenstein reportedly entertained notions of secretly taping the president or organising a constitutional manoeuvre to remove Mr Trump from office. On some level, it doesn't matter if the reports are true. They alter events and perceptions either way. Mr Rosenstein has been on thin ice with the president for so long his feet probably have frostbite. The New York Times story could be the ominous crack that presages a plunge into the cold abyss. Given Mr Rosenstein's position overseeing Robert Mueller and the Russia probe, any move against him by the president would be fraught with political peril. The president has vowed that he won't make a decision about Jeff Sessions until after the mid-term elections in November. Would that reluctance extend to the attorney general's second in command? 9 May 2017- Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein submits a memo to the attorney general regarding FBI boss James Comey's investigation into Hillary Clinton's handling of classified documents. President Trump fires Mr Comey, and Andrew McCabe becomes acting director of the FBI. 11 May 2017- Mr Rosenstein denies that he threatened to quit after being described as a key influence in Mr Comey's firing. The New York Times says Mr McCabe's memos from around this time note that Mr Rosenstein was upset and wished Mr Comey was still at the FBI. 16 May 2017- Mr Rosenstein met Mr McCabe and other senior officials to explain his role in Mr Comey's firing. He reportedly said he was frustrated with Mr Trump, suggested wearing a ""wire"" to secretly record the president during White House visits, and discussed invoking the 25th amendment to oust Mr Trump for being ""unfit"" for office, the New York Times reported on Friday. 17 May 2017- Mr Rosenstein appoints Robert Mueller as special counsel, tasked with overseeing the Russia investigation. 17 March 2018- Mr McCabe is fired by Mr Trump a day before his planned 18 March retirement. He had stepped down from his FBI role amid relentless criticism from Mr Trump. 30 May 2018- US media report that Mr McCabe handed over a confidential memo on Mr Comey's firing - which reportedly details his conversation with Mr Rosenstein - to the special counsel. 26 July 2018- After the justice department rejects a request to release Mr McCabe's memos, conservatives in the House of Representatives file articles of impeachment in an effort to oust Mr Rosenstein, accusing him of stonewalling their requests for information, which he denies.

"This video can not be played Relatives have been anxiously waiting for news At least 136 people have died after a ferry carrying hundreds of people capsized on Lake Victoria, Tanzania, officials say. Many are missing and it is feared that more than 200 people in total may have drowned. Rescue efforts resumed on Friday after being halted overnight. The MV Nyerere ferry overturned near Ukara island on its way from Bugorora. It is thought the overloaded vessel tipped over when crowds on board moved to one side as it docked. Africa Live: Updates on this and other stories Rescue operations on Africa's biggest lake have involved police and army divers, as well as small private boats and local fishermen. The BBC's Aboubakar Famau in Tanzania says fear has gripped residents of the Mwanza region as they wait to hear the fate of relatives who travelled on the MV Nyerere on Thursday. ""I received a call telling me that I have lost my aunt, father and my younger brother,"" says Editha Josephat Magesa, a local resident. ""We are really saddened and urge the government to provide a new ferry because the old one was small and the population is big."" Our reporter says the ferry's engines were recently replaced after local MP Joseph Mkundi complained about the previous ones. Local media say the ferry's official capacity was 100 people, but officials say the vessel was carrying more than 400 passengers when it capsized. It operates on a busy route, crossing eight times a day between the islands of Ukara and Ukwerewe, which are close to Tanzania's second-largest city of Mwanza. The ferry was said to have been particularly busy because it was market day in Bugorora, on Ukerewe island. The vessel was also carrying cargo, including bags of cement and maize, when it capsized around 50 metres from the shore. It is thought that many of the passengers would not have been able to swim. An official investigation will take place once rescue efforts to find survivors have ended. Tanzania's police chief Simon Sirro Mwanza, who has travelled to the area, confirmed the new death toll. So far, 40 people have been rescued and are in critical condition, according to Mwanza Regional Commissioner John Mongella. Local officials initially reported on Thursday that 100 people had been rescued. Exact figures, though, are yet to be confirmed - Reuters said the person who dispensed tickets for the journey also died, with the machine recording the data lost. With a surface area greater than Switzerland, Lake Victoria is the world's second-biggest lake and the largest in Africa Shared by Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania, some 30 million people depend on its resources Challenges include pollution and falling water levels - biodiversity in Lake Victoria has dropped by 50% since the 1980s English colonialist John Hanning Speke named it after Britain's Queen Victoria when he travelled there in 1858 Some have called for the lake's name to be changed - proposals include its Luganda-language name Nalubaale, and Lake Jumuiya which means ""togetherness"" in Swahili Tanzania has seen a number of nautical disasters, with overcrowding often playing a role. In 2012, at least 145 people died when a packed ferry sank while transporting people to the island of Zanzibar in the Indian Ocean. The year before, almost 200 people died in another major incident off the coast of Zanzibar. Hundreds survived, some found clinging to mattresses and fridges. In 1996, more than 800 people died when the MV Bukoba capsized on Lake Victoria. It was one of the the worst ferry disasters of the last century.

"The pound's fall against the dollar and the euro has deepened following Theresa May's assertion after an EU summit that ""no deal is better than a bad deal"". Sterling was already trading lower after EU leaders warned the UK must make compromises on trade and the Irish border to secure a Brexit trade deal. After the Prime Minister said the UK and EU were at an ""impasse"" the pound fell further. The pound dropped from 1% to 1.5% lower against the dollar to $1.3068. By the end of US trading, the pound was on track for its biggest daily drop against the dollar so far this year. Against the euro, the pound was down 1.1% at â¬1.1144 after Mrs May's statement. ""The rhetoric that 'no deal is better than a bad deal' is startling, and undermines recent hopes that a deal could be finalised soon,"" said Hamish Muress, currency analyst at OFX. Business bodies reacted with alarm to the latest development. The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) warned that the possibility of the UK leaving the EU without a trade deal was a big concern for firms. ""Many firms are hugely worried about a messy and disorderly outcome, and the potential impact on their ability to trade and grow. Others could be caught flat-footed. Both sides must make every effort to avoid this scenario,"" said BCC director general Adam Marshall. May: EU must respect UK in Brexit talks Defiant words from PM may not be enough Carolyn Fairbairn, director general of the CBI, said negotiators on both sides had to change tack. ""The stakes could not be higher. Jobs, wages and living standards are at risk, on both sides of the Channel. ""With time slipping away, employers and employees alike need to see constructive dialogue. Pragmatism must come before politics. Every day lost in rhetoric is lost investment and lost jobs,"" she added. Mrs May's statement followed a cool reception for her Chequers plan at a summit of EU leaders in Salzburg. She said the two sides were still ""a long way apart""on the post-Brexit economic relationship. The two options being offered by the EU - for the UK to stay in the European Economic Area and customs union or a basic free trade agreement - were not acceptable, she said. She said EU leaders needed to come up with new alternatives to her Brexit proposals if both sides were to break the current deadlock. ""It is not acceptable to simply reject the other side's proposals without a detailed explanation and counter-proposals,"" Mrs May said.

"This video can not be played Theresa May: ""I will not overturn result of the referendum"" Theresa May has warned that the Brexit negotiations are at an impasse and there will be no progress until the EU treats her proposals seriously. She has accused EU leaders of showing the UK a lack of respect after they rebuffed her Chequers plan at the Salzburg summit without, she said, any alternative or explanation. With the clock counting down to the UK's scheduled exit on 29 March 2019, where does this latest row leave the chances of a deal and what could happen next in the Brexit process? Mrs May has said the two sides remain ""a long way"" apart on the crucial issues of how the UK will trade with the EU after Brexit and the future of the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. She reiterated again her belief thather Chequers blueprint,externalwas the only way of properly implementing Brexit and also ensuring a ""deep and special partnership"" with the EU in the future. Please upgrade your browser The PM has also rejected the two options put on the table by the EU - a Norway-style association agreement and a much looser relationship based on Canada's trade deal with the EU. For its part, the EU has said the Chequers plan is unworkable as it fragments the single market. The next few weeks will be crucial if these differences are to be resolved and the two sides are to fulfil their shared aim of an orderly Brexit and an outline agreement on trade, security and other issues. Boris Johnson quit over the Chequers plan and has since criticised it relentlessly Mrs May has suffered plenty of Brexit setbacks in the past and soldiered but many of her own MPs don't think she is going about the process of leaving the EU the right way. The number of Tories who say they won't vote for the Chequers plan seems to be growing by the day and, remember, any deal she negotiates with the EU has to get through Parliament. There is enormous pressure from the Brexiteer-wing of the party for her to rip up Chequers and throw her weight behind an enhanced version of Canada's 2016 deal with the EU. The so-called Canada Plus Plus option, which removes most customs duties on goods but without paying for access to the single market, is backed by Boris Johnson, David Davis and Jacob Rees-Mogg, among others, who believe the UK Parliament will vote for it. Many Conservative Remainers, like former minister Justine Greening, have also lost faith in Chequers and think there should be a referendum (more of that later) while some Tories think the UK may well end up in a temporary European Economic Area-style arrangement, sometimes called the Norway option. This would mean accepting the free movement of people and the indirect recognition of European Court of Justice rulings - but would allow businesses access to the EU single market, with some strings attached. Amid speculation about further cabinet resignations if she persists with Chequers, calls for the PM to think again are likely to reach a crescendo at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham. If the PM does not shift on the substance of her Chequers plan, expect much frenzied talk of leadership challenges. Will the French president give Brexit the thumbs-up? Salzburg may have caused a dust-up but it hasn't changed the underlying reality that both sides want as amicable a divorce as possible. Some Tory MPs favour a clean break with the EU, which would see the UK fall back on its membership of the World Trade Organization, the global body governing international trade, but they are in a minority. Both sides are ramping up talk of no-deal contingency planning. But they also know that such an outcome would be seen as a political failure and a disaster for business - particularly as the 21-month transition period planned after Brexit day would be scrapped. A summit on 18-19 October of EU leaders was, for a long time, pencilled in as the moment that the two sides would have to look each other in the eye and reach a deal. However, this is not now seen as feasible and the focus is on a special one-off summit that has been arranged for mid-November. An agreement then, the thinking goes, would still allow enough time for the UK and European Parliaments and a supermajority of European states - that's 20 out of 27 - to ratify any deal before the 29 March deadline. So, the clock is ticking but the EU is renowned for finalising deals at the 11th hour and it wouldn't be the first time the talks have seemed on the brink of collapse only for a deal to be pulled out of the fire. If she brings a deal back from Brussels, Theresa May has another big hurdle to negotiate. She must persuade Parliament to back it, in a vote likely before the end of the year or in early 2019. Tory Brexiteers opposed to Chequers have suggested up to 80 MPs would be prepared to vote against it. Although we don't know what the final deal will look like and the size of any rebellion would, in all likelihood, be much smaller, even a dozen Conservatives defying the leadership would risk defeat for the PM, with her non-existent Commons majority. The opposition parties are unlikely to come to the PM's aid, with Labour saying any deal is unlikely to pass its six tests guaranteeing workers' rights and all the ""benefits"" of the single market and customs union. The Labour leadership is hoping to inflict a defeat as a way of triggering a general election. Some Leave campaigners are bracing themselves for another referendum Reality Check: How would the UK hold a second EU referendum? Reality Check: Can the UK change its mind on Article 50? Court to rule on whether UK can halt Brexit It is written into law that the UK will be leaving at 23:00 GMT on 29 March 2019, two years to the day after the government notified the EU of its intention to quit, by triggering Article 50 of the EU's Lisbon Treaty. But if there is no deal or Parliament rejects the deal, we are in uncharted territory and it is impossible to say with any certainty what will happen next. Mrs May has insisted the 2016 referendum result will not be overturned but if Parliament cannot agree on what kind of Brexit it wants, a fresh public vote might yet end up being the only way to break the deadlock. But how could this happen? Should Mrs May lose a vote on her deal, she could conceivably resign and her successor may use his or her new mandate to seek Commons approval for a vote on another referendum. Alternatively, MPs who back a so-called People's Vote - which include the Liberal Democrats, the SNP, Plaid Cymru as well as a growing number of Labour MPs - could seek to table a backbench amendment to the legislation that has been promised to implement the UK's withdrawal. With most Tories, so far, publicly opposed to a referendum, any vote is likely to be extremely tight. Either way, Parliament would then need to pass enabling legislation, similar to the 2015 European Referendum Act, setting out the date of the poll, the question and the franchise, as well as other details. As it stands, if no deal has been agreed by 21 January 2019, ministers will be required to make a statement to Parliament about the next steps. This could trigger the mother of parliamentary battles over Brexit. Some European leaders believe Brexit can be halted but unless Mrs May or her successor and the other 27 nations agree to extend the two-year Article 50 process beyond 29 March, this cannot legally happen. Critics say there won't be enough time while there is also another stumbling block in that those who back a vote do not all agree on what question should be asked on the ballot paper. While the People's Vote campaign wants the option to remain, the Labour leadership has said it should be on the terms of the deal - in other words between leaving with Mrs May's deal or no deal. What Labour really wants is a general election so it can take over the negotiations. It is only after 29 March that discussions about future co-operation - including a trade deal - will really begin in earnest.

"Firefighters who tackled the Grenfell Tower fire are among those who may have been exposed to toxic fumes Concerns have been raised for Grenfell Tower emergency workers and survivors, especially children, who may have been exposed to toxic fumes and asbestos. Dr Fiona Wilcox called on the NHS to set up a screening programme for those who were exposed to smoke and dust during and after the fire. In her letter she said the impact of the disaster,which killed 72 people,could be ""wide-ranging"". She added that residents who lived near the site were unlikely to be at risk. In the letter to NHS chief executive Simon Stevens, the coroner wrote that ""real concern"" had been expressed for the health of survivors, especially children. But she said she'd been told no physical health screening programme had been put in place for survivors. I hope you get justice, says firefighter 999 operator haunted by victim's voice Grenfell bereaved to decide site's future NHS England said its staff had provided ""extraordinary care"" to residents on the night of the fire and in the months afterwards, including mental health care. It promised to respond to the letter within 56 days. Grenfell Tower is known to have contained asbestos Dr Wilcox said firefighters involved in the events of 9/11 in New York had since suffered health problem related to fumes and dust that they inhaled. Grenfell Tower was known to contain asbestos and the smoke from the fire will have contained multiple toxic substances"", she said. In 2014 three firefighters who helped in the aftermath of the 9/11 terror attack died from canceron the same day. But doctors said it was unclear whether the sicknesses could be linked to their presence at the scene. Breathing in dust or fumes is associated with a number of long-term health conditions. The most common conditions are asbestos-related diseases and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Asbestos-related diseases include asbestosis, a scarring or thickening of the lung tissues, lung cancer, and mesothelioma, a type of cancer that targets the tissues that cover the lining of internal organs, in particular the lungs and chest wall, and which is difficult to treat. COPD is an umbrella term for a group of lung conditions that cause breathing difficulties, such as emphysema and chronic bronchitis. Symptoms, which include a persistent chesty cough and frequent chest infections, tend to get worse over time. Dust inhalation can also trigger or exacerbate conditions such as asthma. Public Health England has studied the air quality around Grenfell Tower since the fire concluded that air pollution remains low, with no asbestos detected. Its report said that although ""small amounts of asbestos fibres will have been dispersed within the smoke plume"" they presented a small risk to health. ""Asbestos related diseases are typically associated with a long term workplace exposure to high levels of airborne asbestos fibres,"" the report added. Campaign group Grenfell United welcomed Dr Wilcox's letter and said the potential long-term impacts of the fire should be taken seriously. ""The NHS are just about to start some screenings, we need to make sure this is the start of the long-term health care for survivors now and for years to come,"" it said.

A petition, signed by more than 2,000, has asked for a ""protection order"" for the bridge and original message. A spokesman for Network Rail, which owns the bridge, said: ""While we sympathise with requests to reinstate this much-loved graffiti, we simply cannot agree to deface our own structures. The original ""give peas a chance"" graffiti signalled to many drivers they were nearly home ""For us, no graffiti is good graffiti. If it is obscene or offensive we remove it. That's why this inoffensive slogan stayed up for so long. But while we 'gave peas a chance,' it seems, sadly, another criminal graffiti artist did not."" The words ""give peas"" were removed on Sunday, replaced by ""Helch"" on Monday and on Wednesday the whole wording was changed to ""give Helch a break!!!"". It is not known who or what ""Helch"" is. The graffiti was changed to ""Helch a chance"", but has been further changed to ""give Helch a break!!!"" Any member of the public can apply for a building to be listed and these are then reviewed by Historic England. Historic England will make a recommendation to the Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Arts, Heritage and Tourism, who makes the final decision. Local authorities can also compile their own list of buildings with historic significance in their area. The petition, directed to Arts, Heritage and Tourism minister Michael Ellis, said the original slogan had been emblazoned on the bridge for more than two decades and had now been ""defaced"". Hunter and Aurora in top 100 baby names England's rainy-day phrases explained Father's tiny bike ride for late daughter ""Peas"" was reportedly the name of a London graffiti artist who daubed his name on the M25's only Edwardian bridge, near Denham. The words ""give"" and ""a chance"" were added later, with the amended graffiti thought to refer to his frequent arrests, according to an historic building report by Oxford Archaeology. AFacebook group to celebrate the graffiti,externalhas nearly 8,000 followers and its administrator said the bridge was a""sign of being nearly home. It's a sign of family"". Network Rail said it takes a zero-tolerance approach to graffiti, as artists place themselves in danger on railway lines.

"Facebook hopes to compete with YouTube via the IGTV service Instagram has been criticised after sexually suggestive videos of children were recommended to its users. News siteBusiness Insider,externalfound the videos during an investigation into Instagram's IGTV app. A video featuring a graphic depiction of genital mutilation was also recommended to many users. Instagram apologised and said it had removed the videos from its service and shut down one account associated with one clip. IGTV launched in June and is seen as a way for Instagram owner Facebook to compete with YouTube. As with YouTube, people can post long videos to IGTV. Anyone using the Instagram app is encouraged to watch clips the service believes they would enjoy or which are proving popular. In its investigation, Business Insider monitored which videos were being recommended to users of the fledgling IGTV service. Its reporters set up a dummy account on IGTV and populated it with profile information to suggest it was being used by a child. Instagram hack sees accounts replaced with film stills Ed Sheeran's cats now have Instagram Are Instagram stars facing a brand backlash? Over a three-week period, Isobel Hamilton said two videos showing young girls in ""sexually suggestive"" poses were recommended to dummy users, as well as another graphic video. Several other sexually-themed videos were also pushed to the accounts. The videos featuring the young girls were reported to the police by the NSPCC. The charity had helped Business Insider with its research and reviewed the content the reporters found. The videos were removed five days after being reported. ""This is yet another example of Instagram falling short by failing to remove content that breaches its own guidelines,"" the NSPCC told Business Insider. In response, Instagram said it ""cared deeply"" about making sure all of Instagram, including IGTV, was a ""safe place"". ""We have zero tolerance for anyone sharing explicit images or images of child abuse,"" it told the BBC. It said it had a proactive and reactive system set up to help spot and remove inappropriate content. All the content reported by Business Insider has now been removed, it said, as well as one account found to be breaching the site's community guidelines. Does drop in Snapchat users spell trouble?

"This video can not be played Relatives have been anxiously waiting for news At least 136 people have died after a ferry carrying hundreds of people capsized on Lake Victoria, Tanzania, officials say. Many are missing and it is feared that more than 200 people in total may have drowned. Rescue efforts resumed on Friday after being halted overnight. The MV Nyerere ferry overturned near Ukara island on its way from Bugorora. It is thought the overloaded vessel tipped over when crowds on board moved to one side as it docked. Africa Live: Updates on this and other stories Rescue operations on Africa's biggest lake have involved police and army divers, as well as small private boats and local fishermen. The BBC's Aboubakar Famau in Tanzania says fear has gripped residents of the Mwanza region as they wait to hear the fate of relatives who travelled on the MV Nyerere on Thursday. ""I received a call telling me that I have lost my aunt, father and my younger brother,"" says Editha Josephat Magesa, a local resident. ""We are really saddened and urge the government to provide a new ferry because the old one was small and the population is big."" Our reporter says the ferry's engines were recently replaced after local MP Joseph Mkundi complained about the previous ones. Local media say the ferry's official capacity was 100 people, but officials say the vessel was carrying more than 400 passengers when it capsized. It operates on a busy route, crossing eight times a day between the islands of Ukara and Ukwerewe, which are close to Tanzania's second-largest city of Mwanza. The ferry was said to have been particularly busy because it was market day in Bugorora, on Ukerewe island. The vessel was also carrying cargo, including bags of cement and maize, when it capsized around 50 metres from the shore. It is thought that many of the passengers would not have been able to swim. An official investigation will take place once rescue efforts to find survivors have ended. Tanzania's police chief Simon Sirro Mwanza, who has travelled to the area, confirmed the new death toll. So far, 40 people have been rescued and are in critical condition, according to Mwanza Regional Commissioner John Mongella. Local officials initially reported on Thursday that 100 people had been rescued. Exact figures, though, are yet to be confirmed - Reuters said the person who dispensed tickets for the journey also died, with the machine recording the data lost. With a surface area greater than Switzerland, Lake Victoria is the world's second-biggest lake and the largest in Africa Shared by Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania, some 30 million people depend on its resources Challenges include pollution and falling water levels - biodiversity in Lake Victoria has dropped by 50% since the 1980s English colonialist John Hanning Speke named it after Britain's Queen Victoria when he travelled there in 1858 Some have called for the lake's name to be changed - proposals include its Luganda-language name Nalubaale, and Lake Jumuiya which means ""togetherness"" in Swahili Tanzania has seen a number of nautical disasters, with overcrowding often playing a role. In 2012, at least 145 people died when a packed ferry sank while transporting people to the island of Zanzibar in the Indian Ocean. The year before, almost 200 people died in another major incident off the coast of Zanzibar. Hundreds survived, some found clinging to mattresses and fridges. In 1996, more than 800 people died when the MV Bukoba capsized on Lake Victoria. It was one of the the worst ferry disasters of the last century.

"The Court in Luxembourg is said to be ready to hear the case soon Anti-Brexit campaigners have been given permission to take their case to Europe's highest court as they seek a ruling on whether it can be halted. The cross-party group of politicians argue that Article 50 can be revoked if MPs vote to do so. The Court of Session in Edinburgh had previously rejected their bid to have the case referred to European judges. But they have now won an appeal, and the European Court of Justice will be asked to give a definitive ruling. The panel of appeal judges at the Court of Session said the ""urgency of the issue"" - with the UK due to leave the EU on 29 March - meant its request to the European Court was being done under expedited procedure. May: EU must respect UK in Brexit talks Read the Court of Session ruling,external The UK government said it was ""disappointed"" by the decision and was giving it ""careful consideration"". But a spokesman stressed that the government remained committed to implementing the result of the EU referendum and ""will not be revoking Article 50."" The legal case has been brought by politicians including Scottish Green MSPs Andy Wightman and Ross Greer, Labour MEPs David Martin and Catherine Stihler and SNP MEP Alyn Smith, who have claimed that Brexit is ""not inevitable"" and ""there is still time to change course"". Welcoming the ruling, Mr Greer said: ""If negotiations collapse, as appears to be happening, we have to know that a no deal disaster is not the only option on the table."" The politicians have been joined by lawyer Jolyon Maugham QC, the director of the Good Law Project, who said the latest ruling was a ""bombshell"" that could ""decide the fate of the nation"" and potentially allow the country to ""wake up from the nightmare that is this government's Brexit"".

Prime Minister Theresa May has admitted that negotiations with the EU havereached an ""impasse""after her Brexit plans were rejected at a summit in Salzburg earlier this week. But in a speech outside Downing Street she insisted that: ""Nobody wants a good deal more than me - but I will not overturn the result of the referendum, nor will I break up my country."" The speech was described as ""dreadful"" by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, who claimed Mrs May's so-called Chequers proposals for Brexit were now a ""dead duck"" and that Brexit ""should not happen"" if the PM was not going to keep the country in the single market and customs union. The petitioners argue that the UK should now effectively be allowed to change its mind on Brexit, without needing the permission of the other 27 EU members. If it is successful, their case could strengthen the hand of any attempt by MPs to keep the UK in the EU after the final details of its departure terms are known. This is because it would give parliament the power to unilaterally halt Brexit if it feels any final deal - or no deal - is unacceptable, even if the government wants to leave regardless. Court of Session judge Lord Boyd ruled in June that the case could not go to the European Court in Luxembourg as it was ""hypothetical"" and did not reflect political reality as it ""seems highly unlikely that this government will revoke the notification"". Theresa May has insisted she will not change tack despite being told by EU leaders in Salzburg that she faces having no deal unless she alters her Brexit plans The campaigners appealed against that decision, and on Friday the court ruled in their favour. The ruling was delivered by Scotland's most senior judge, Lord Carloway, and his colleagues Lord Menzies and Lord Drummond Young. The appeal judges said matters had ""moved on"" since Lord Boyd's original ruling, with the European Union (Withdrawal) Act now setting out how parliamentary approval is to be sought once the negotiations between the UK government and the EU conclude. Lord Carloway said it was therefore ""clear"" that MPs at Westminster would be required to vote on any Brexit deal agreed by the EU and the UK government. He stated: ""It seems neither academic nor premature to ask whether it is legally competent to revoke the notification and thus to remain in the EU. ""The matter is uncertain in that it is the subject of a dispute; as this litigation perhaps demonstrates. ""The answer will have the effect of clarifying the options open to MPs in the lead up to what is now an inevitable vote."" The judge also said the European court would not be advising parliament on ""what it must or ought to do"". Instead, he said it would be ""merely declaring the law as part of its central function"", adding that ""how parliament chooses to react to that declarator is entirely a matter for that institution"". In their draft reference to the European Court, the judges ask: ""Where a member state has notified the European Council of its intention to withdraw from the European Union, does EU law permit that notice to be revoked unilaterally by the notifying member state? ""And, if so, subject to what conditions and with what effect relative to the member state remaining within the EU?""

"The pound's fall against the dollar and the euro has deepened following Theresa May's assertion after an EU summit that ""no deal is better than a bad deal"". Sterling was already trading lower after EU leaders warned the UK must make compromises on trade and the Irish border to secure a Brexit trade deal. After the Prime Minister said the UK and EU were at an ""impasse"" the pound fell further. The pound dropped from 1% to 1.5% lower against the dollar to $1.3068. By the end of US trading, the pound was on track for its biggest daily drop against the dollar so far this year. Against the euro, the pound was down 1.1% at â¬1.1144 after Mrs May's statement. ""The rhetoric that 'no deal is better than a bad deal' is startling, and undermines recent hopes that a deal could be finalised soon,"" said Hamish Muress, currency analyst at OFX. Business bodies reacted with alarm to the latest development. The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) warned that the possibility of the UK leaving the EU without a trade deal was a big concern for firms. ""Many firms are hugely worried about a messy and disorderly outcome, and the potential impact on their ability to trade and grow. Others could be caught flat-footed. Both sides must make every effort to avoid this scenario,"" said BCC director general Adam Marshall. May: EU must respect UK in Brexit talks Defiant words from PM may not be enough Carolyn Fairbairn, director general of the CBI, said negotiators on both sides had to change tack. ""The stakes could not be higher. Jobs, wages and living standards are at risk, on both sides of the Channel. ""With time slipping away, employers and employees alike need to see constructive dialogue. Pragmatism must come before politics. Every day lost in rhetoric is lost investment and lost jobs,"" she added. Mrs May's statement followed a cool reception for her Chequers plan at a summit of EU leaders in Salzburg. She said the two sides were still ""a long way apart""on the post-Brexit economic relationship. The two options being offered by the EU - for the UK to stay in the European Economic Area and customs union or a basic free trade agreement - were not acceptable, she said. She said EU leaders needed to come up with new alternatives to her Brexit proposals if both sides were to break the current deadlock. ""It is not acceptable to simply reject the other side's proposals without a detailed explanation and counter-proposals,"" Mrs May said.

"Harry Uzoka was stabbed in the heart after a row with a fellow model George Koh Three men have been jailed for killing a model in a row over his girlfriend. Harry Uzoka, 25, was stabbed in the heart by fellow model George Koh in west London in January after he went to settle the dispute. Koh, convicted of murder at the Old Bailey in August, was given a life sentence with a minimum of 25 years. Merse Dikanda was also found guilty of murder and jailed for at least 22 years, and Jonathan Okigbo was given a 14-year sentence for manslaughter. Although initially friendly, the relationship between Mr Uzoka and Koh deteriorated after Koh claimed to have had sex with Mr Uzoka's girlfriend Ruby Campbell, who is also a model. The pair then exchanged angry text messages and arranged to gather some friends and meet up in Shepherd's Bush for a fight. (L_R) George Koh, Merse Dikanda and Jonathan Okigbo were jailed at the Old Bailey Koh, Dikanda and Okigbo, all 24, took at least three knives - including a machete - with them to the rendezvous. Mr Uzoka recruited his flatmate Adrian Harper and they armed themselves with dumbbell bars. Mr Harper told the jury he was ""expecting a fist fight"". But he said when he saw his friend again Mr Uzoka said ""I've been stabbed,"" and collapsed in the road. Remembering Harry Uzoka Murdered model's girlfriend 'threatened' Three guilty of killing London model Mr Uzoka was signed with London's Premier Model Management agency and counted catwalk star Jourdan Dunn among his friends. Judge Wendy Joseph QC said he had enjoyed helping others, including Koh. She described Koh's behaviour as swinging ""between excessive admiration and spite"". The judge added: ""This manifested itself in several ways. Sometimes Koh would claim to look very like Harry and tried to imitate his style of dress. At other times he contacted Harry's Instagram friends, falsely speaking ill of them."" This video can not be played CCTV of the attack shows Dikanda wiping a blade clean on his trousers The judge went on to say that while the loss of any life was tragic, it was all the more so ""when a victim is so young, able and generous"". She described Mr Uzoka as a young man ""who overcame his own difficulties to make a great success of his young life and to be a remarkable role model for others"". ""He had, with great talent, forged a successful international career as a male model. He was one of the first black British men to do so."" In a statement read to the court, Mr Uzoka's mother said her son's death was ""yet another senseless killing"". ""Our lives changed forever when I got that phone call. His death has left a gaping hole, a void and crack in our family. ""The trauma has affected us emotionally and financially, he was an inspiration to all, a beautiful boy who will never be forgotten. We still find it difficult to believe he is actually gone."" The judge also highlighted the impact of the murder on the wider community, saying children were becoming afraid of going out and parents ""are thinking of buying their sons stab-proof vests"".

"Aaron and Jasper are declining in popularity but Nigel is making a comeback of sorts Hunter and Aurora have joined the top 100 names for baby boys and girls in England and Wales, according to official statistics. Oliver and Olivia remain the most popular names, positions they have held since 2013 and 2016 respectively. New entries into the top 100 boys' names in 2017 also included Ralph, while Aaron and Jasper fell out of the top 100. New entries for girls included Orla, Edith, Bonnie, Lyla and Hallie. These replaced Lexi, Zoe, Maddison, Sarah, Felicity and Lydia. 'Hardly anyone calls babies my name' A modern browser with JavaScript and a stable internet connection is required to view this interactive. If you cannot see the baby names tracker,click to launch the interactive content,external. Nigel is making a comeback of sorts, with 11 baby boys given that name in 2017. The name was thought to be almost extinct afterfewer than three babies were named Nigel the year before. It is the first time Hunter has been in the top 100 boys' names since records began in 1904. There were 841 babies given the name, making it the 78th most popular in England and Wales. Ralph was last in the top 100 in 1944. In 2017 it was the 98th most popular and chosen for 669 boys. Aurora joined the girls' top 100 at number 80. Results were based on names given from an analysis of 679,106 babies born in 2017,the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said,external. If you cannot see this graphic produced by the Office for National Statistics,click to launch the interactive content,external. Number of children given a particular spelling of a name in 2017: Boys Oliver - 6,259 Harry - 5,031 George - 4,929 Noah - 4,273 Jack - 4,190 Jacob - 3,968 Leo - 3,781 Oscar - 3,739 Charlie - 3,724 Muhammad - 3,691 Girls Olivia - 5,204 Amelia - 4,358 Isla - 3,373 Ava - 3,289 Emily - 3,121 Isabella - 2,627 Mia - 2,590 Poppy - 2,527 Ella - 2,452 Lily - 2,405 The popularity of names varies across England with Muhammad more popular that Oliver in three regions The ONS only provides figures when there were at least three babies given the same spelling of a name. It does not reveal names taken by only one or two babies to protect their privacy. It means the name Siri has sometimes dropped off the list completely but appeared again in 2017 as three people gave their daughters the same name as Apple's ""intelligent assistant"". There were also 301 girls named Alexa, the name that triggers Amazon's Echo smart speaker. Chris Evans reveals names of baby twins The baby who was the only Nigel Christine Lampard has baby girl Regionally, Olivia was the most popular girls' name throughout England and Wales, but Muhammad was more popular than Oliver in London, the West Midlands and Yorkshire and the Humber. The Duchess of Sussex's name Meghan is seeing a rise in popularity, while Harry remains a firm favourite Harry was the most popular boys' name in north-east England and second most popular overall. Megan has fallen 17 places on 2016, but the so-called ""Markle Sparkle"" might be behind the rise of the alternative spelling of Meghan. There were 49 baby girls given the name in 2017. Whether the 2018 royal wedding gives Meghan a further boost will be revealed next year. There were dozens of children named Bowie but did David inspire their parents? David Bowie may have inspired parents to name their children in tribute. The number of children named Bowie has risen since 2016,the year he died of cancer. There were 38 boys and six girls with the name in 2017 and 35 boys and seven girls in 2016. That compares with 12 boys and fewer than three girls the year before. The rankings are based on names with the exact same spellings. That means the 76 baby girls called Khaleesi, after the word for a queen invented for the character Daenerys Targaryen in Game of Thrones, are recorded separately to the four girls called Kaleesi. Muhammad (3,691 boys) and Mohammed (1,982) combined would still not be more popular than the traditional spelling of Oliver. However there are other variations on the name, such as Mohammad (837), Mohamed (269) and Muhammed (450) that would make it more popular if they were all counted as the same name. Nick Stripe from the ONS said: ""Although Oliver and Olivia remained the most popular baby names in 2017, some fascinating changes took place beneath them. ""Leo entered the boys' top 10 for the first time, whilst Hunter rocketed into the top 100, also for the first time, reaching number 78. Sarah, the most popular name for baby girls throughout much of the 1970s and 1980s, dropped out of the top 100 for the first time since our records began in 1904. ""Brand new entries into the top 100 for girls include the names Aurora and Hallie."" Sarah-Jane âLjungstrom from parenting website Channelmum.com, said the rise of Aurora and Hallie was down to people looking for ""heavenly"" names.

Poppy is up five places into the top ten, while Daisy, Ivy, Willow and Iris are all big climbers too. ""For boys, millennial parents are leading the way with the 'soft macho' phenomenon.

"The Sun's story was picked up by a number of other publishers Sir Elton John and David Furnish have accepted ""significant"" libel damages over a newspaper allegation that their dog inflicted ""Freddy Krueger-like"" injuries on a child at a play date. The couple brought proceedings against News Group Newspapers over a front page story in The Sun on Sunday in February. Their solicitor said the injuries were not serious and that the allegation was ""false and seriously defamatory"". Neither Sir Elton nor Furnish was at London's High Court on Friday. The Sun's story, captioned Elton's Dog Did This To My Girl, reported that Sir Elton's spaniel bit a five-year-old girl at the singer's Berkshire home in February 2016. Solicitor Jenny Afia said the story had claimed the child had been ""subjected to a serious attack"" and that Sir Elton and Furnish had ""failed to make any attempt to find out how the little girl was... despite being aware of the incident."" David Furnish and Sir Elton John with their sons Elijah and Zachary ""The truth is that the injuries were not serious, and the claimants, far from ignoring the incident, made several inquiries about the girl's welfare to her father and nanny,"" Mr Justice Matthew Nicklin was told. ""Each time it was confirmed the girl was fine. ""I am pleased to say that the newspaper has now accepted unequivocally that this allegation was false and seriously defamatory. ""As a result, it has agreed now to apologise to Sir Elton John and David Furnish, and to pay significant damages as well as to reimburse their legal costs."" ""The defendant offers its apology to the claimants and is pleased that the matter has been amicably resolved,"" said Jeffrey Smele, solicitor for News Group Newspapers. The Sun on Sunday's story appeared on the paper's website and was picked up by a number of other publishers, including Metro, the Daily Mirror and the London Evening Standard.

"This video can not be played A car was swept away in a river in Carmarthenshire after heavy rain across Wales Strong winds and heavy rain have caused travel disruption and flooding to parts of the UK. Storm Bronagh, the second named storm of the year, swept eastwards across Wales and England overnight, with gusts reaching 78mph. Flooding and fallen trees have caused problems on the roads and disrupted rail services. Sheffield and Sennybridge, Powys, both got around half a month's rain fall in 24 hours. A yellow weather warning for wind is in force for parts of England and Wales until 18:00 BST on Friday. However, forecasters said the impact of the storm was ""waning"" and will mainly affect offshore areas in the north east of the country.

"Donald Tusk rejected Theresa May's Brexit proposals at an EU summit this week and posted an Instagram story shortly afterwards. ""A piece of cake, perhaps?,"" said the head of the European Council, alongside a picture of him and May at the summit in Austria. ""Sorry, no cherries."" This provocative post was Tusk's idea and is part of a wider strategy to appeal to young people via the app, an EU source has told the BBC. Here are five things to know about how Donald Tusk and other EU leaders use Instagram. EU must compromise or no deal, says minister ""He's the one coming up with these posts - he has a good sense of what works and what doesn't,"" says an EU source working with Tusk on social media. ""He's not the biggest social media geek but he likes it. ""He jokes and laughs and wants to show humour. This post was clearly something he was into - we produced the image [of cherries] and he said let's do it!"" The post combines the EU's favourite Brexit cliches. First, the idea that the UK wants to ""have its cake and eat it"". Second, that the UK is guilty of ""cherry-picking"" - keeping the bits of EU membership it likes and ditching the bits it doesn't. ""The cherry-picking one is something we have talked about a lot and finally we had a good pic from a good angle,"" says an EU source This video can not be played Brexit: The top five clichÃ©s Many Brexit supporters reacted angrily to Tusk's post on social media.

A source close to Tusk said the message should not be taken too seriously. ""It was an innocent gesture. He is always expressing how sad he is about the U.K. leaving. ""We were taking the difficulty of the situation and giving it a soft touch."" Tusk's team did an in-house analysis of various social media platforms and ultimately decided to focus on Instagram, the BBC understands. They found that while Twitter is useful for communicating with journalists, not so many other people people use it regularly. However, Tusk did post this bombastic video on his Twitter account, showing his Autumn priorities in the style of an action film trailer. Allow Twitter content?

"Theresa May's Chequers plan was rejected by EU leaders at their Salzburg summit The UK government insists Theresa May's Brexit proposal is a ""workable, credible"" deal, despite being rejected by EU leaders at a summit in Salzburg. Minister James Brokenshire said ""tough words"" were to be expected near the end of negotiations but the government was ""resolute"" in its bid to get a deal. He said the so-called Chequers plan ""does deliver"" and it was now for the EU to ""be specific"" about its concerns. The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. Prime Minister Theresa May says her plan for the UK and EU to share a ""common rulebook"" for goods, but not services, is the only credible way to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Katya Adler: What just happened in Salzburg? Tusk: May's plan won't work Sturgeon calls for Brexit to be delayed Brexit: All you need to know But it is opposed by some within her own party who argue it would compromise the UK's sovereignty, and got a cool reception at this week's EU summit in Salzburg, Austria. Mrs May described her talks there with European Council President Donald Tusk as ""frank"". In a news conference, Mr Tusk said that while there were some ""positive elements"" in the Chequers plan, EU leaders had agreed that the proposals needed to be redrawn: ""The suggested framework for economic co-operation will not work, not least because it is undermining the single market."" He followed it up by posting a photograph on Instagram of he and Mrs May looking at cakes with the caption: ""A piece of cake, perhaps? Sorry, no cherries."" The EU has argued that the UK cannot ""cherry-pick"" elements from its rulebook. What's behind Tusk's Instagram diplomacy? On Friday, Communities Secretary Mr Brokenshire, a former Northern Ireland Secretary, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""The Chequers deal is a workable, credible deal to meet our ambitions. ""They [the EU] have said that it's about the integrity of the single market and we believe the Chequers deal responds to that, and it's for the EU to engage with what's on the table."" This video can not be played Chris Grayling: EU's position on Irish border 'simply impossible to accept' But former cabinet minister Iain Duncan Smith, who campaigned for Brexit, questioned why the UK had gone for a plan which ""was so obviously not going to cut the mustard with the EU"". He added that the EU had ""behaved appallingly"" towards Mrs May and he described Mr Tusk's Instagram photograph as ""quite insulting"". The UK and EU are trying to reach a deal in time and want to avoid a hard border - physical infrastructure like cameras or guard posts - between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic but cannot agree on how. The EU insists on its own ""legally binding Irish backstop"" - what it describes as an insurance policy to prevent a hard border, if no other solution can be found. By BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg Theresa May and her government have been trying to pursue a middle way, to find a stance between the basic options - a close ""Norway style"", or free trade deal roughly like Canada. It feels that the search for something else has been in vain. Sources on the EU side express irritation at the UK's approach, at what they see as the strident tone the prime minister took in the last 48 hours. The European Council is not the same as Prime Minister's Questions, it's suggested. But to kick out publicly as they did in Salzburg certainly runs the risk of pushing Mrs May too far. Read more from Laura. It suggests Northern Ireland should stay aligned with the EU in key areas, in effect staying in the customs union and single market. But the UK says this is unacceptable as it would split Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK. Transport Secretary Chris Grayling told BBC Newsnight: ""At the moment what the European Union is asking in and around Northern Ireland is simply impossible for any UK government to accept. And actually if they stick with that position, there will be no deal."" Mrs May has said the UK will come forward ""shortly"" with new proposals on the so-called ""backstop"" arrangements, but also insisted Chequers was the ""only serious and credible proposition"" for an overall deal. Please upgrade your browser Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeontweeted,external: ""Now that the EU has explicitly rejected it, the Chequers pretence has to stop. ""At the very least, single market/customs union membership must be back on the table and the Article 50 clock [the time-limited process taking Britain out of the EU] must be stopped to avoid a cliff edge."" Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer told the BBC that if the negotiations ended without a deal, it ""would be catastrophic for our economy, plunging it into real crisis"". ""Really, the next few weeks should be all about how does the prime minister avoid that,"" he told the BBC. ""She needs to accept that we need a customs union and a strong single market deal, both for the Northern Ireland border and for our economy."" Leading Conservative Remainer Dominic Grieve said he believed a deal would be offered but one that would be ""very difficult"" for the UK to accept - ""which is why we are going to have to reconsider what we are doing"". He said the EU could only show limited flexibility towards a non-member: ""We are asking for something that the EU, as an international treaty organisation, cannot readily give us."" Mr Tusk said on Thursday that October would be the ""moment of truth"" for reaching a deal, and that ""if the conditions are there"" an additional summit would be held in November to ""formalise"" it. Meanwhile, pro-European Scottish politicians seeking a ruling on whether Brexit can be halted have beengiven permission to take their case to Europe's highest court. The cross-party group of politicians argue that Article 50 can be revoked if MPs vote to do so. They won an appeal at the Court of Session in Edinburgh, Scotland's highest court, and the European Court of Justice will be asked to give a definitive ruling.

"This video can not be played Theresa May: ""I will not overturn result of the referendum"" UK Prime Minister Theresa May has said the EU must treat the UK with more ""respect"" in Brexit negotiations. In a statement at Downing Street she said for EU leaders to reject her plan with no alternative at this ""late stage of negotiations"" was ""not acceptable"". She said talks had reached an ""impasse"" and could only be unblocked with ""serious engagement"" from the EU side. European Council President Donald Tusk said a ""compromise"" was possible but the UK proposals had to be ""reworked"". The pound's fall against the dollar and the eurodeepened following Mrs May's statement. The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. Brexit: What happens next? Tusk: May's plan won't work What's behind Tusk's Instagram diplomacy? All you need to know about Brexit The two sides are trying to reach a deal by November so it can be ratified in time. They want to avoid a hard border - physical infrastructure like cameras or guard posts - between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic but cannot agree on how. Mrs May says her plan for the UK and EU to share a ""common rulebook"" for goods, but not services, is the only credible way to avoid a hard border. She tried to sell the plan directly to EU leaders at a summit in Salzburg, Austria, this week. European press sympathy for Mrs May Court to rule on whether UK can halt Brexit Pound falls after Brexit statement Mixed Northern Ireland response to statement Speaking afterwards, Mr Tusk said that while there were some ""positive elements"" in Mrs May's proposals, EU leaders had agreed that ""the suggested framework for economic co-operation will not work, not least because it is undermining the single market"". In response to Mrs May's latest statement, he said the UK's stance at the summit ""was surprisingly tough and, in fact, uncompromising"" but that he remained ""convinced that a compromise, good for all, is still possible"". On Friday, the prime minister said: ""Throughout this process, I have treated the EU with nothing but respect. The UK expects the same, a good relationship at the end of this process depends on it. ""At this late stage in the negotiations, it is not acceptable to simply reject the other side's proposals without a detailed explanation and counter proposals."" This video can not be played Theresa May: ""We will never agree to it - it would mean breaking up our country."" A stern tone, strong words. But while there is no remote sign from the PM today that she is about to compromise, forces in the EU and in her own party are intent on forcing her to do so. Her problem is that they want to push her in different directions. Rhetoric doesn't change the fact that few of the players involved outside Number 10 believe that the suggestions the prime minister has put forward can be the ones that ultimately will win the day. Read Laura's blog She said the two sides were still ""a long way apart"" on two big issues: the post-Brexit economic relationship between the UK and EU, and the ""backstop"" for the Irish border, if there is a delay in implementing that relationship. The two options being offered by the EU for the long-term relationship - for the UK to stay in the European Economic Area and customs union or a basic free trade agreement - were not acceptable, she added. The first would ""make a mockery of the referendum"" she said, while the second would mean Northern Ireland would be ""permanently separated economically from the rest of the UK by a border down the Irish Sea."" Mrs May said no UK prime minister would ever agree to that: ""If the EU believe I will, they are making a fundamental mistake."" The prime minister attempted to reassure EU citizens living in the UK that, in the event no deal can be reached ""your rights will be protected"". She said ""no-one wants a good deal more than me"", adding: ""But the EU should be clear: I will not overturn the result of the referendum. Nor will I break up my country."" The BBC's Europe editor Katya Adler said EU diplomats did not consider that their officials working on Brexit negotiations had been disrespectful. They said they had listened to the UK position and are offering a unique partnership post-Brexit, but will not agree to anything that would harm the EU. She added that the prime minister's statement was being viewed in Brussels as a ""tubthumper"" designed to bolster her political position at home. Mr Tusk followed up his remarks on Thursday by posting a photograph on Instagram of Mrs May and himself looking at cakes with the caption: ""A piece of cake, perhaps? Sorry, no cherries."" The EU has argued that the UK cannot ""cherry-pick"" elements from its rulebook. That was criticised by some Conservatives, including Brexiteer Iain Duncan Smith who described it as ""quite insulting"". Mr Tusk's team says the Instagram presence is aimed at reaching out to a younger audience. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the prime minister's negotiating strategy ""has been a disaster"" and said ""political games from both the EU and our government need to end"" to avoid a no-deal scenario. ""The Tories have spent more time arguing among themselves than negotiating with the EU. From day one, the prime minister has looked incapable of delivering a good Brexit deal for Britain,"" he said. Labour wants to see the UK join a customs union with the EU after Brexit, but remain outside of the single market. Arlene Foster, leader of Northern Ireland's DUP, who Mrs May relies on for a Commons majority in key votes, said the prime minister was ""right to stand firm in the face of disrespectful, intransigent and disgraceful behaviour by the European Union"". She added that the UK would ""not countenance any new regulatory or customs barriers"" between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. Leading Conservative Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg welcomed the ""strong and forthright"" speech from the prime minister but said she should abandon her Chequers plan and come forward with a Canada-style free trade agreement. ""This is the most realistic approach and similar to the EU's proposal."" Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said that while the EU position had been ""bluntly expressed"" it was not new - it was just that the prime minister ""hasn't been listening"".

"Ms Wilson's two-year long relationship with Mark Kennedy began in 2003 Police have admitted for the first time that an undercover officer had a sexual relationship with an environmental activist with the knowledge of bosses. Legal documents seen by the BBC reveal they knew about Mark Kennedy's relationship with Kate Wilson and allowed it to continue. She was among several women he had relationships with while undercover. In public statements to date, police have maintained such relationships would never have been sanctioned. Posing as an environmental campaigner, Mark Stone, the police spy began a two-year relationship with Ms Wilson in 2003. She was one of a number of women he was involved with during his seven years undercover. In his real life, Mr Kennedy was married with children. Woman wins undercover officer case Ms Wilson is currently involved in legal action against the Metropolitan Police and the National Police Chiefs Council. At different times the Met and the NPCC's predecessor, the Association of Chief Police Officers, were responsible for Mr Kennedy's deployments. In documents disclosed to her legal team, the police concede that Mr Kennedy's sexual relationship with Ms Wilson ""was carried out with the acquiescence of his cover officers and line manager"". Ms Wilson told the BBC: ""The police have said that these cases were a failure of supervision and management, and that is just not the case. ""Management were absolutely complicit in what was going on."" In November 2015, the Met Police paid compensation to a number of women who were duped into relationships with police spies. In an apology at that time, the force said: ""The forming of a sexual relationship by an undercover officer would never be authorised in advance."" Ms Wilson's lawyer, Harriet Wistrich said: ""The police have always said this would never be permitted. ""What we are seeing in this case - and then of course it makes us question all the other cases - is that they allowed it to continue because it was convenient, because it assisted whatever their objectives were. ""That is incredibly disturbing."" The Met police said it would not comment because of the ongoing legal action In the legal documents, the police admit that the relationship contravened Ms Wilson's human rights and the breach was made worse because Mr Kennedy's bosses knew what he was doing. The police admissions are part of their response to a case Ms Wilson is pursuing through the Investigatory Powers Tribunal, which hears claims arising from the Human Rights Act.  A hearing will take place on 3 October. Ms Wistrich said: ""Kate was involved in social justice and environmental campaigning. ""She does not expect that the state could actually allow an undercover officer to have a sexual relationship in order to facilitate his gathering of intelligence. ""It is a very shocking revelation in a so-called democratic society."" The Met said it would not comment on the revelations because of the ongoing legal action. ""The Metropolitan Police Service has made clear its position on long-term sexual relationships known to have been entered into by some undercover officers in the past. ""Those relationships were wrong and should not have happened.""

"The sanctions relate to China's purchase of 10 Russian Sukhoi Su-35 fighter jets China has told the US to withdraw sanctions on its military over purchases of Russian jets and missiles or ""bear the consequences"". The US says China has contravened US sanctions on Moscow introduced over Russian actions in Ukraine and alleged interference in US politics. China recently bought 10 Russian Sukhoi Su-35 fighter jets and S-400 missiles. Beijing has not joined in the sanctions imposed on Moscow by the US and its Western allies since 2014. Its forces took part in giant Russian war games held earlier this month. Sanctions: What are they and why do countries use them? China's 'globalised' military power China is fast becoming a manufacturer of sophisticated weaponry in its own right but it remains eager to buy advanced Russian weaponry, especially air defence systems and combat aircraft. Moscow - after years of some reluctance - is now more willing to transfer this sort of weaponry to Beijing. The BBC's China correspondent, Stephen McDonell, says that while it seems like strong language from the foreign ministry spokesman, just how angry Beijing is will become clearer when they say what their retaliation will be. Russia has also criticised the sanctions on the Chinese military, with Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov describing them as ""yet another act of unfair competition"", Interfax reported. Meanwhile his deputy, Sergei Ryabkov, said the US was ""thoughtlessly undermining"" global stability by ""whipping up tensions in Russian-American ties"" and warned it against ""playing with fire"". US officials have said the sanctions are aimed at Russia, and are not intended to undermine other countries' defence capabilities and similar action against other countries could be considered. By Jonathan Marcus, BBC Defence & Diplomatic Correspondent The target of these sanctions is Russia rather than China but the impact is likely to be to encourage co-operation between Beijing and Moscow who, to a large extent, already share a worldview and resist what they see as Washington's efforts to throw its weight around. China's developing military relationship with Russia was underscored by its participation at the recent Vostok exercises and it is not going to halt sophisticated weapons purchases from Russia. The US move could just deepen the already tense trading relationship with Beijing. Sanctions may be a good way of registering US displeasure and causing Russia economic pain, but they may well not produce the desired outcome, a change in Russian policy. The world's economic balance of power is slowly changing - sanctions imposed by a once-dominant US is a weapon that is gradually weakening and some believe their overuse could accelerate this process. China's Equipment Development Department (EDD), which is responsible for improving China's military technology, and its head, Li Shangfu, are sanctioned for completing ""significant transactions"" with Russia's state arms exporter, Rosoboronexport.

"Boo and Walt were photographed the day after their birth in their mother's arms DJ Chris Evans has revealed his newborn twins have been called Boo and Walt. The Radio 2 presenter was back behind the mic of his breakfast show on Friday morning after taking Thursday off to welcome his baby boy and girl. Evans' wife, Natasha Shishmanian, called into Evans' show on Friday to tell listeners everything was ""more than OK"" back home. ""I have four children in my bed right now,"" she told her husband and his millions of listeners. She gave birth at Frimley Park Hospital in Surrey after being induced on Wednesday. Baby names: Hunter and Aurora join top 100 Evans and Shishmanian, who married in 2007, also have two sons - Noah, nine, and six-year-old Eli. Evans has not explained the reasoning behind the babies' names, though he used to use part of Wake Up Boo! by the Boo Radleys as a jingle on his Radio 1 breakfast show. Natasha Shishmanian called into her husband's show on Friday Shishmanian added that ""the kids are desperate for me to take them to school... [t]hey want to show [the twins] off to all their friends."" Evans then asked his wife to introduce a segment on the show, joking: ""As if she hasn't got enough on her plate."" He said he and his wife had not slept much since the babies were born and that what sleep he had enjoyed had been on the sofa. ""Mum doing very well, babies are splendid, sparkling. We are beyond blessed,"" he told his listeners. The family posed for a photograph outside the hospital the morning after the birth ""It's a good job we've got guests on,"" he continued. ""Otherwise I'd just talk about babies all day today."" Joanna Lumley, Rowan Atkinson, Michael Palin and Take That were among the stars who joined Evans at Wogan House in London for his final show of the week. Last week Evans said he and his wife had previously given their unborn babies the ""working title"" Ping and Pong. The 52-year-oldrevealed earlier this monthhe is to leave Radio 2 later this year to host Virgin Radio's breakfast show. Sara Cox, tipped by many to be Evans' replacement,filled in for him on Thursday, jokingly telling listeners ""this is your brand new Radio 2 Breakfast show.""

"Wet age-related macular degeneration affects around 26,000 people in the UK A landmark ruling against two leading drug companies could save the NHS in England ""hundreds of millions"" a year. Novartis and Bayer were trying to stop NHS doctors from prescribing a cheaper treatment for a serious eye condition. Health bosses said the judgement in the High Court may reduce the power of companies to set prices. Drug company Novartis said they were ""disappointed"" because patients were being asked to accept an unlicensed treatment to save the NHS money. The case centred on the treatment of patients with the common eye condition, wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Twelve NHS bodies in the north east of England were offering these patients Avastin, a cheaper alternative to the licensed drug, Lucentis. David Hambleton, chief executive officer of NHS South Tyneside clinical commissioning group (CCG), one of the NHS groups involved in the case, welcomed the judgment, saying it was a good day for patients and the NHS. ""We've always said we think that it's important that patients should have the choice of a very effective treatment for wet AMD, and it's actually a fraction of the cost of the other alternatives. ""So I think what we do now is offer patients that choice. We believe that they will support very strongly having a cost-effective, safe treatment and saving the NHS generally a lot of money. It is a victory for common sense over commercial interests."" The 10-year fight to offer a cheaper drug The case was brought by pharmaceutical giants Bayer and Novartis against twelve NHS CCGs in the north of England. The NHS groups were offering patients a choice between Lucentis and Eylea - drugs licensed for eye treatment - and the far cheaper drug Avastin, which is recommended by the World Health Organisation (WHO) for treating eyes, but only licensed for cancer treatment in the UK. Novartis and Bayer manufacture the two more expensive licensed drugs - Lucentis which costs Â£561 and Eylea which costs Â£800. By comparison, Avastin costs about Â£28 per injection. Avastin is widely used around the world, particularly in the US. In January, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) concluded that Avastin was as safe and effective as the two licensed drugs, Lucentis and Eylea. Mike Burdon, President of the Royal College of Ophthalmologists said: ""Licensing laws are designed to protect patients from poorly regulated unproven drugs, but it is the drug companies' responsibility to apply for a licence. ""We are treating 40,000 new diagnoses of wet AMD annually - the saving could amount to Â£500m a year. This amounts to one district hospital being built annually."" Wet AMD can be treated with injections Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is an eye condition that affects more than 600,000 people, 40,000 of those suffer from wet AMD It causes people to lose central vision, usually in both eyes It is more common with age and there are two main types - wet AMD and dry AMD Reading becomes more difficult, colours appear less vibrant and faces can be hard to recognise Wet AMD develops when abnormal blood vessels form and damage the cells at the back of the eye Wet AMD can be treated if caught early. Drugs are injected into the eye to stop the growth of the abnormal blood vessels Legal threat over cheaper eye drug NHS 'must step in' over Avastin row NHS 'should use cancer drug for eyes' David Hambleton, of NHS South Tyneside CCG, said the ruling would result in a rethink for NICE and the MHRA, the UK's drug regulatory body. ""I think at least we've got some real legal clarity now, so both of the bodies - NICE and the MHRA - will need need to look at what their guidance says. ""Now they have the option of allowing the use of so-called 'off-label' drugs."" Responding to the ruling, a spokesperson from pharmaceutical company Novartis said:  ""Novartis is deeply disappointed in this decision and remains of the opinion that the policy undermines the well-established legal and regulatory framework that is there to protect both patients' safety and to ensure health care professionals can prescribe with confidence."" Dr Sheuli Porkess, Deputy Chief Scientific Advisor to The Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI) said: ""This extraordinary judgement potentially undermines the regulation of all medicines and by doing that, neither patients nor doctors have clarity on what information to trust.""

China lands bombers in South China Sea The US says it is ""committed to a free and open Indo-Pacific"" and has sailed warships close to artificial islands built by Beijing to challenge what it sees as Chinese efforts to restrict freedom of navigation in a strategically important area.

"This video can not be played Footage shows former rap label boss Marion ""Suge"" Knight running over two men with his pick-up truck - the man in this clip survived Former US rap mogul Marion ""Suge"" Knight has pleaded no contest to a voluntary manslaughter charge over a hit-and-run incident in 2015. The Death Row Records founder made the plea to avoid charges of murdering one man and attempting to murder a second with his pick-up truck in Los Angeles. Knight will be formally sentenced to 28 years in prison in October. His record label helped launch the careers of artists including Dr Dre, Tupac Shakur and Snoop Dogg. The 2015 incident happened after an argument over the making of Straight Outta Compton, a biopic about rap group NWA. Under Californian state law, a no contest plea is the legal equivalent of a guilty plea. Knight was facing possible life in prison if found guilty as originally charged As part of the agreement, the murder charges against Knight, 53, will be dismissed by prosecutors, along with separate criminal cases charging him with robbery and making criminal threats. The deal, in which Knight admitted using a ""deadly and dangerous weapon"" when he ran down two men with his vehicle, calls for him to serve 22 years in prison for voluntary manslaughter with a further six years added because of the US ""three-strikes"" law relating to repeated violations. Had Knight been found guilty of murder as originally charged, he would have faced life in prison, prosecutors said. Knight co-founded Death Row Records with the pioneering producer Dr Dre in the 1990s, but later declared bankruptcy and the company was sold at auction for $24m (Â£16.7m). Sales and profits for Knight's Death Row Records declined after he was imprisoned in 1996 Knight has a history of legal problems. He spent time in jail in 1997 and 2003 for parole violations arising from assault charges. He later pleaded guilty to hitting his girlfriend in an incident in 2008. While his label was initially very successful, his fortunes began to slide in 1996 when rapper Tupac Shakur was shot and killed in the passenger seat of Knight's car. Allow YouTube content?

In 1997, rival rapper Biggie Smalls was shot and Knight was sued for wrongful death. Smalls' estate claimed that Knight had ordered the killing in revenge for Shakur's death. Knight denied it and the suit was dismissed. Suge Knight says Tupac may be alive Six of the most notorious execs in music How rock and rap combined to create Beats The charge relates to an incident in January 2015 in Compton, a suburb of Los Angeles. Knight was accused of deliberately running over two men with his pick-up truck outside a hamburger restaurant following an argument on the set of a commercial for Straight Outta Compton. One of the victims, Terry Carter, died of his injuries while the other, Cle ""Bone"" Sloan, suffered serious injuries to his feet and head. Footage of the incident captured by security cameras show Knight's vehicle pulling up to the drive-in shop, with one of the victims approaching the driver's side window. Following what appears to be a brief discussion, a struggle then ensues. Knight's truck is seen going into reverse, throwing the man to the ground. It then moves forward, driving over his legs and slams into the other victim, who was killed. Knight turned himself in to authorities a day after the incident. His attorneys had said he was acting in self-defence and was fleeing armed attackers when he ran over Mr Carter and Mr Sloan. Mr Sloan has denied claims he was carrying a gun during the confrontation.

"Security concerns have been raised about the imminent release from prison of the radical preacher Anjem Choudary and other supporters of the banned extremist group al-Muhajiroun. About a dozen followers are out or will be soon, as restrictive terror protection orders on others end. A counter-terrorism activist says the group could become active again. Security Minister Ben Wallace told BBC News the government works to reduce the risk of freed terrorist offenders. He said there are a ""suite of powers and measures we can put in place,"" adding: ""Terrorist offenders have a lot more supervision than normal offenders and that's because we recognise the risk and we seek to reduce it to as low as possible."" Choudary will leave prison next month. Thefirebrand preacher was convicted in August 2016of inviting support for Islamic State and was jailed for five-and-a-half years. How Anjem Choudary's mouth was finally shut Terror sentences 'may be too low' Others in his network, including right-hand man Mizanur Rahman, were convicted of similar offences and will also be automatically released half way through their sentences. The fact the releases will happen at the same time as an increased threat of violent extremism by far right groups is ""troubling"" for Adam Deen, who was a member of al-Muhajiroun (ALM) until 2003 but now works for the counter-extremism organisation Quilliam. ""Put that in the mix with the growing threat and the growing noise from the far right about anti-Muslim bigotry - that's a disastrous cocktail where young Muslim minds can be manipulated and used for the agenda of these extremist organisations,"" he said. A further concern is that growing disorder in jails may be undermining efforts to de-radicalise extremist inmates, according to a former prison governor. ""Such is the state of lawlessness inside many of Britain's prisons where some of these people will have served their sentences, it isn't really realistic to assume that they've had any meaningful experience of counter-radicalisation,"" said Ian Acheson who wrote areport for the government on extremism in prisons.,external Some terrorist prisoners are isolated from the general prison population and Choudary reportedly spent some of his sentence in a newly-built separation centre at HMP Frankland in County Durham. But Mr Acheson said some jails were now ""ungoverned spaces where all sorts of things can flourish unchallenged"" including ""the spread of hateful and extremist ideologies"". From 2016 the authorities effectively silenced al-Muhajiroun through a range of measures but it is feared they may soon become active again. ""We suppressed their activities and their influence,"" said Richard Walton who ran Counter-Terrorism Command at the Metropolitan Police at the time. ""ALM was a constant thorn in our side over many years,"" said Mr Walton. ""No one should underestimate the pernicious impact of the leaders of this group who were often charismatic and articulate."" The group was linked to violent jihadists who carried out terror attacks, including the killers of Fusilier Lee Rigby in 2013 and the London Bridge attack in which eight members of the pubic were killed in 2017. Some of its members went to Syria where they fought with so-called Islamic State. They include LondonerSiddartha Dharwho the US State Department says has taken part in the murder of hostages. His current whereabouts are unknown. The BBC understands that disquiet over the jail terms in some of the ALM cases is leading to change. The Sentencing Council introduced new guidelines in March 2018, which could mean longer terms for those caught in the early stages of terror plotting. Meanwhile, theCounter-Terrorism and Border Security Bill,externalaims to increase the maximum sentence for some terror offences and to prevent automatic prison releases at the half way point for those who are still a risk to the public. Some ALM activists have distanced themselves from the group while in detention, the BBC understands. Police and intelligence agency resources are stretched As well as released prisoners there are also ALM leaders whose freedom was severely curtailed by Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measures (TPims). They are placed on terror suspects by the home secretary, and usually end after two years. Details of several orders have emerged in High Court appeal hearings and include: JM, who ""assumed leadership functions of ALM"" said a judge. The TPim ended in the summer LF, ""a senior leader"" allegedly linked to London Bridge killer Khuram Butt, whose TPim expires October LG, on a TPim that ends in early 2019, and who allegedly facilitated the travel of others to join the Islamic State group While a small number of men with previous links to ALM appear to have begun street preaching and posting on the internet, there has been no evidence of terrorism-related activity. The attention is inevitably focused on what happens when ALM leader Choudary is out. Former member Adam Deen believes ""it's highly unlikely that he's reformed and being out of prison he would definitely get lots of credence from his followers"". Prisons Minister Rory Stewart also recently warned that Choudary remains a ""deeply pernicious, destabilising influence."" He acknowledged that police and MI5 would have to ""watch him like a hawk."" In August, the prime minister revealed that police and the security service MI5 are running 676 investigations into suspected terrorism. Thirteen plots by Islamist extremists have been foiled since March 2017, they say.

"Theresa May's uncompromising tone was matched by the EU The Brexit action plan for EU leaders coming to Salzburg - briefed over and again in advance of the summit in off-the-record conversations with European diplomats - had been to spout words of support for Theresa May to help her secure an EU/UK Brexit divorce deal not just with Brussels, but with political opponents back home. But this summit has now ended, leaving a decidedly bitter taste in the mouth and a sense that this will be a long and very difficult autumn of negotiations with a real prospect of no deal at the end. So what just happened? The EU's ""support Theresa"" effort was actually launched the day before the summit with chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, suggesting a ""new, improved"" proposal on the key sticking point of the Irish border. Taking stock of where we are with Brexit Reality Check: How are Brexit preparations getting on? With the intention of directly addressing UK concerns, Mr Barnier also made explicit assurances that no-one in the EU wanted to break up the constitutional integrity of the UK. Now, this ""new plan"" for the border wasn't really new at all, but EU leaders never intended to compromise their position on Ireland or their rejection of Theresa's May's Chequers proposal for the future economic partnership between the EU and UK. Their Brexit aim for this summit was to go as far as they could with words and gestures to throw Theresa May a lifeline. Please upgrade your browser But their tokenistic effort was a misreading of Theresa May's political position - especially ahead of what is likely to be a difficult annual conference with her own Conservative Party. The prime minister swiftly and bluntly rebuffed the Barnier Irish border suggestions - thereby misreading EU leaders right back. There was huge irritation in EU circles - and that's how this summit began. Brexit: All you need to know Chequers plan 'will avoid hard border' EU frustration only grew when the prime minister then arrived in Salzburg insisting unequivocally that her Chequers Brexit proposal was the only way forward. Theresa May's uncompromising tone was then matched note by note by the EU and here we are now. Theresa May rejected EU negotiator Michel Barnier's ""new"" proposal for the Irish border The fact that EU leaders had already pointed to problems in the Chequers proposal long before this summit; the fact that they praised other parts of the prime minister's plan, such as her thoughts on security; the fact that numerous European prime ministers said here in Salzburg that there was more hope now that there could be a successful Brexit deal, thanks in part to the prime minister's Chequers plan - all that has now been eclipsed. But let's face it, critics and political rivals of Theresa May were waiting and watching this summit for storm clouds to gather over Chequers. That now is the focus of their attention. And perhaps - if Theresa May can survive this next political storm at home - it rather suits both the EU and the UK in the long term to have the public perception of Brexit negotiations now as fraught. So that if a Brexit deal does finally emerge later this autumn, the perception will be that it was hard fought and hard won. Will EU's Salzburg summit mark a Brexit turning point?

"This video can not be played Bassist Theo Ellis recalled the band's first ever label meeting in their acceptance speech Indie band Wolf Alice have picked up the 2018 Mercury Prize for their eclectic, enchanting second album, Visions of a Life. The London four-piece were almost lost for words as they took to the stage to accept the Â£25,000 prize. ""It means so much to pick this up with my three best friends,"" said singer Ellie Rowsell. The group beat the likes of Noel Gallagher, Arctic Monkeys and Lily Allen to lift the trophy. They also saw off the bookies' favourite, Nadine Shah, whose third album, Holiday Destination, explores her experiences as a second-generation immigrant, and the UK's attitudes to refugees. But the 31-year-old, who was born to Pakistani and Norwegian parents and raised in Whitburn, South Tyneside, stole the televised prize ceremony with a fierce and passionate performance of the song Out The Way. Visions of a Life was praised by judges as ""an exuberant tapestry of swirling pop, grunge and indie guitar rock."" The band put their appeal more idiosyncratically: ""We're too pop for rock and too rock for pop."" In fact, their second album built on the promise of their debut My Love Is Cool (which also received a Mercury nomination) cementing their status as future festival headliners with a hypnotic jumble of grunge, dream-pop and shoegaze stoner rock. The songs coalesce around Rowsell, an enigmatic frontwoman who can switch from a shy ingÃ©nue (Don't Delete The Kisses) to a screaming, vengeful She-Ra (Yuk Foo) without pretence or artifice. As it happened; Wolf Alice win the Mercury Prize Wolf Alice interview: 'Our album is like hummus' Mercury Prize 2018: Guide to the nominees The 26-year-old was a Mercury Prize judge in 2016, and said that made her band's victory all the more meaningful. ""You get given almost 300 albums -  so I know the intensity and the frustration of  making that decision,"" she said backstage, adding: ""Now I know what overwhelmed feels like.""

Earlier, the band's bassist Theo Ellis said he felt vindicated after the band faced years of rejection from record companies. ""The first label meeting we ever had, we walked into a room, and the geezer said, 'You don't look like a band at all. What are you? What are you supposed to be? All your songs sound different. You don't look like each other.' ""We never really figured it out, but here we are,"" he added. The group said they would invest their prize money in building a studio to record their third album next year. Other nominees for the 2018 Mercury Prize included jazz act Sons of Kemet, London MC Novelist and up-and-coming soul star Jorja Smith. But there had been criticism that this year's list favoured mainstream, commercial artists at the expense of newcomers who needed exposure. This video can not be played Mercury Prize 2018: Watch the nominees in action Wolf Alice's victory strikes a happy medium between the two extremes; with a record that was popular enough to reach number two in the charts, but was overlooked in the best album category at this year's Brit Awards. ""These kind of things can never please everybody,"" said Rowsell. ""The last time we were nominated, I hardly recognised most of the list, and this [year's] list was far more well known. ""It's nice to champion lesser-known and smaller artists, but there's plenty of other ways of doing that."" ""I don't think the award has any duty to any one sector of the industry or the other,"" said Jeremy Pritchard, bass player for fellow nominees Everything Everything. ""Contrariness is part of its identity."" Everything Everything were also two-time nominees for the prize and stressed that even being featured on the shortlist could change a young band's career. ""Our first nomination gave us some longevity. It gave us a kick at that stage of our career when we needed it most.""

"Boo and Walt were photographed the day after their birth in their mother's arms DJ Chris Evans has revealed his newborn twins have been called Boo and Walt. The Radio 2 presenter was back behind the mic of his breakfast show on Friday morning after taking Thursday off to welcome his baby boy and girl. Evans' wife, Natasha Shishmanian, called into Evans' show on Friday to tell listeners everything was ""more than OK"" back home. ""I have four children in my bed right now,"" she told her husband and his millions of listeners. She gave birth at Frimley Park Hospital in Surrey after being induced on Wednesday. Baby names: Hunter and Aurora join top 100 Evans and Shishmanian, who married in 2007, also have two sons - Noah, nine, and six-year-old Eli. Evans has not explained the reasoning behind the babies' names, though he used to use part of Wake Up Boo! by the Boo Radleys as a jingle on his Radio 1 breakfast show. Natasha Shishmanian called into her husband's show on Friday Shishmanian added that ""the kids are desperate for me to take them to school... [t]hey want to show [the twins] off to all their friends."" Evans then asked his wife to introduce a segment on the show, joking: ""As if she hasn't got enough on her plate."" He said he and his wife had not slept much since the babies were born and that what sleep he had enjoyed had been on the sofa. ""Mum doing very well, babies are splendid, sparkling. We are beyond blessed,"" he told his listeners. The family posed for a photograph outside the hospital the morning after the birth ""It's a good job we've got guests on,"" he continued. ""Otherwise I'd just talk about babies all day today."" Joanna Lumley, Rowan Atkinson, Michael Palin and Take That were among the stars who joined Evans at Wogan House in London for his final show of the week. Last week Evans said he and his wife had previously given their unborn babies the ""working title"" Ping and Pong. The 52-year-oldrevealed earlier this monthhe is to leave Radio 2 later this year to host Virgin Radio's breakfast show. Sara Cox, tipped by many to be Evans' replacement,filled in for him on Thursday, jokingly telling listeners ""this is your brand new Radio 2 Breakfast show.""

"Italy's competition watchdog has opened an inquiry into Ryanair's decision to add new hand luggage charges. From November, Italian passengers wishing to take two bags on board will pay â¬6 (Â£5) for priority boarding. Those that do not will only be able to take on one bag that fits under the seat in front, with the second bag checked in at a cost of â¬8. Antitrust said hand luggage was ""an essential element of transport"" and should be included in the ticket price. Some travellers only carry their 10kg (22lb) standard ""wheely"" bag. Ryanair spokesman Kenny Jacobs said: ""We look forward to co-operating with this Italian inquiry. All Ryanair customers are free to bring one piece of carry-on bag onboard. But no airline customer has a right to unlimited carry-on bags."" UK rules applied by Ryanair allow passengers to take two pieces of hand luggage into the aircraft if they have paid Â£5 for priority boarding. If they have not paid that charge, the second bag is put into the hold - albeit without being charged as checked luggage. Antitrust said Ryanair's new Italian policy could amount to unfair commercial practice in that it distorts the final price of the ticket and does not allow a true comparison with other airlines' prices. Ryanair brings in new rules on cabin bags Ryanair boss may leave within five years Italian consumer associations had complained to Antitrust about the Ryanair decision. ""If its unfair commercial practice on hand luggage is confirmed, Ryanair... should reimburse all its customers who suffer unfair additional costs,"" the association Codacons said, promising to take the matter to court if necessary. In August, Ryanair said the policy was not aimed at making money but intended to ""improve punctuality and reduce boarding gate delays"". However, research by US travel consultancy IdeaWorks suggests the airline made Â£1.7bn from charges for add-ons such as checked baggage and selected seats in the last 12 months. That meant almost a third of the company's profits came from so-called ""ancillary revenue"". The Italian inquiry creates more bad publicity for the airline as it faces widespread strikes by staff across Europe. Shareholders also delivered a blow to the airline on Thursday after many declined to vote for the re-election of the company's chairman at its general meeting. David Bonderman was re-elected but only with 70.5% of shareholder's support - a drop from last year's meeting where he gained 89.1%. Aberdeen Standard Investments, which owns a 0.9% stake in the airline, said it wanted to see ""clear progress"" on the succession of Mr Bonderman and senior independent director Kyran Mclaughlin by this time next year. ""The length of time both have been on the board suggests a lack of focus on board succession planning,"" ASI said. ""Excessive tenure also calls into question an individual's independence and objectivity and our engagement on governance matters suggests that the board is not listening carefully enough to shareholders' views.""

"The sanctions relate to China's purchase of 10 Russian Sukhoi Su-35 fighter jets The US has imposed sanctions on the Chinese military over its purchasing of Russian military jets and surface-to-air missiles. It says such purchases contravene US sanctions on Moscow introduced over Russian actions in Ukraine and alleged interference in US politics. China recently bought 10 Russian Sukhoi Su-35 fighter jets and S-400 missiles. Beijing has not joined in the sanctions imposed on Moscow by the US and its Western allies since 2014. Its forces took part in giant Russian war games held earlier this month. Sanctions: What are they and why do countries use them? Relations between the US and Russia deteriorated rapidly after Moscow annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. Russia's alleged meddling in the 2016 American presidential election and military involvement in Syria's ongoing civil war increased tensions. China's Equipment Development Department (EDD) and its head, Li Shangfu, are sanctioned for completing ""significant transactions"" with Russia's state arms exporter, Rosoboronexport. The EDD and Mr Li have been added to a Blocked Persons List,external, meaning any assets they hold in the US are frozen and Americans are ""generally prohibited"" from doing business with them. Furthermore, the EDD is denied export licences and excluded from the American financial system. Washington also blacklisted an additional 33 people and entities associated with Russian military and intelligence. The  Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (Caatsa) was passed in 2017 to provide the Trump administration with the necessary means to target Russia, Iran and North Korea with economic and political sanctions. US President Donald Trump issued an executive order on Thursday intended to allow the sanctions to be implemented. The Trump-Russia saga in 200 words US punishes Russians over vote meddling ""The ultimate target of these sanctions is Russia,"" a senior administration official told journalists. ""Caatsa sanctions in this context are not intended to undermine the defence capabilities of any particular country"" but are ""aimed at imposing costs on Russia in response to its malign activities"". Similar action against other countries would be considered, Washington added. A Russian S-400 anti-aircraft weapon system in Crimea A politician in Moscow said the US sanctions would have no impact on the sales of its fighter jets and missiles. ""I am sure that these contracts will be executed in line with the schedule,"" Franz Klintsevich, a Russian member of parliament, was quoted as saying by Russia's Interfax news agency. Russia's new military - should Nato worry? ""The possession of this of this military equipment is very important for China,"" he added. Asia is the most important foreign market for Russian arms producers, reportedly accounting for 70% of their exports since 2000. India, China and Vietnam are the principal sources of demand for Russian weapons in the region, according to a recent Chatham House report. US and Russia: What are sanctions?

"This video can not be played Relatives have been anxiously waiting for news At least 136 people have died after a ferry carrying hundreds of people capsized on Lake Victoria, Tanzania, officials say. Many are missing and it is feared that more than 200 people in total may have drowned. Rescue efforts resumed on Friday after being halted overnight. The MV Nyerere ferry overturned near Ukara island on its way from Bugorora. It is thought the overloaded vessel tipped over when crowds on board moved to one side as it docked. Africa Live: Updates on this and other stories Rescue operations on Africa's biggest lake have involved police and army divers, as well as small private boats and local fishermen. The BBC's Aboubakar Famau in Tanzania says fear has gripped residents of the Mwanza region as they wait to hear the fate of relatives who travelled on the MV Nyerere on Thursday. ""I received a call telling me that I have lost my aunt, father and my younger brother,"" says Editha Josephat Magesa, a local resident. ""We are really saddened and urge the government to provide a new ferry because the old one was small and the population is big."" Our reporter says the ferry's engines were recently replaced after local MP Joseph Mkundi complained about the previous ones. Local media say the ferry's official capacity was 100 people, but officials say the vessel was carrying more than 400 passengers when it capsized. It operates on a busy route, crossing eight times a day between the islands of Ukara and Ukwerewe, which are close to Tanzania's second-largest city of Mwanza. The ferry was said to have been particularly busy because it was market day in Bugorora, on Ukerewe island. The vessel was also carrying cargo, including bags of cement and maize, when it capsized around 50 metres from the shore. It is thought that many of the passengers would not have been able to swim. An official investigation will take place once rescue efforts to find survivors have ended. Tanzania's police chief Simon Sirro Mwanza, who has travelled to the area, confirmed the new death toll. So far, 40 people have been rescued and are in critical condition, according to Mwanza Regional Commissioner John Mongella. Local officials initially reported on Thursday that 100 people had been rescued. Exact figures, though, are yet to be confirmed - Reuters said the person who dispensed tickets for the journey also died, with the machine recording the data lost. With a surface area greater than Switzerland, Lake Victoria is the world's second-biggest lake and the largest in Africa Shared by Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania, some 30 million people depend on its resources Challenges include pollution and falling water levels - biodiversity in Lake Victoria has dropped by 50% since the 1980s English colonialist John Hanning Speke named it after Britain's Queen Victoria when he travelled there in 1858 Some have called for the lake's name to be changed - proposals include its Luganda-language name Nalubaale, and Lake Jumuiya which means ""togetherness"" in Swahili Tanzania has seen a number of nautical disasters, with overcrowding often playing a role. In 2012, at least 145 people died when a packed ferry sank while transporting people to the island of Zanzibar in the Indian Ocean. The year before, almost 200 people died in another major incident off the coast of Zanzibar. Hundreds survived, some found clinging to mattresses and fridges.

"This video can not be played A car was swept away in a river in Carmarthenshire after heavy rain across Wales Strong winds and heavy rain have caused travel disruption and flooding to parts of the UK. Storm Bronagh, the second named storm of the year, swept eastwards across Wales and England overnight, with gusts reaching 78mph. Flooding and fallen trees have caused problems on the roads and disrupted rail services. Sheffield and Sennybridge, Powys, both got around half a month's rain fall in 24 hours. A yellow weather warning for wind is in force for parts of England and Wales until 18:00 BST on Friday. However, forecasters said the impact of the storm was ""waning"" and will mainly affect offshore areas in the north east of the country. 'Luckiest' driver unhurt after tree crush Speed restrictions were in place for many trains across the network in Wales and the west and north of England. Some LNER train services on the East Coast mainline have been cancelled because of damage to overhead lines near Durham that engineers worked overnight to fix. Arriva Train Wales, Great Western Railway, Southeastern, South Western Railway and Thameslink services have also been hit by delays. The huge tree fell on the car crushing the roof and smashing the windscreen The strongest gust during Storm Bronagh of 78mph was recorded on the Isle of Wight. In Nottinghamshire, a man escaped injury when a huge tree fell on his car on a rural road at 02:00 BST. The driver managed to get himself out of the vehicle but was described as ""clearly shaken"" by the fire service. Multiple flood warnings were in place in south Wales and England on Friday morning, as well as more than 60 flood alerts. In Cynghordy, Carmarthenshire,a car was swept down a river on Thursday,but no-one was inside. One video showed a man rescuing an elderly woman from a car that was surrounded by flood water in Tinsley. This video can not be played This man rescued an elderly woman from her car after she became stranded by flash flooding Pictures posted on social media showed vehicles with flood water up to their bumpers on a road between Sheffield and Rotherham. East Midlands trains said there had been severe flooding in Sheffield station and warned customers to take extra care. Ali, Idris, Lily: Why do storms have names? A history of UK named storms Scotland cleans up after storm The Met Office spokesman said the departure of Storm Bronagh from our shores meant ""reasonably good weather conditions"" are expected over the next few days. Forecasters are anticipating the arrival of another low pressure system on Sunday, although the Met Office said it will ""perhaps not as bad as first feared"". A yellow weather warning for wind has been issued for parts of England and Wales on Sunday between 09:00 and 23:59 BST. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"RBS, NatWest and Ulster Bank say the problems that meant customers could not access their bank accounts online on Friday have been ""resolved"". For about five hours customers were locked out of their accounts until the problem was fixed mid-morning. Many took to social media to complain, a day after technical problems also hit rival Barclays. An RBS spokesman said: ""We would like to apologise to customers who experienced issues this morning."" He added that: ""The issue has now been resolved and no customer will be left out of pocket as a result of this."" RBS Group - which owns the RBS, NatWest and Ulster Bank brands - said the failure was caused by a ""technical glitch"" in a regular update to their firewall which was applied early on Friday morning. After the problems appeared the update was reversed, allowing customers to get into their accounts once again. The banks' ATM network and telephone banking was not impacted at any stage. The bank emphasised that it was an ""access issue"" and there is no evidence that customer data was compromised. RBS chief executive Ross McEwan apologised this morning. According to the group's latest annual report it has 19 million customers in the UK and Republic of Ireland with 5.5 million active mobile app users. Many of them shared their frustration on social media, with a number pointing out that the problems arrived at a terrible time - on payday. Allow Twitter content?

Customer Paul Murphy told the BBC: ""This is just what you need as the weekend approaches and bills to pay."" Jess Cochrane said: ""It's payday, I can't transfer my wage to the joint account all the bills come out of, I have no card and no branch near me."" The issue was just the latest in a growing series of problems that customers of Britain's banks have experienced in the last 18 months. The RBS group had asimilar problem in April last year, when its banking apps stopped working. In 2014 it was fined Â£56m by regulators after a 2012 software issue left millions of customers unable to access accounts for weeks. Earlier this year TSB's huge IT meltdown led to weeks of pain for customers and the eventualresignation of chief executive Paul Pester. But this week has marked three bank outages. Customers of online challenger bank Cashplus - which targets people with poor credit histories - were unable to access their accounts, make cash withdrawals, or make or receive payments earlier this week. Then on ThursdayBarclays customers were locked out of their accountsonline for several hours. The bank said it is yet to discover what caused the problem. A Barclays spokeswoman told the BBC: ""Our priority yesterday was to get services back online for customers. We're currently investigating the root cause of the outage."" Nicky Morgan MP, Chair of the Treasury Committee, said: ""It simply isn't good enough to expose customers to IT failures, including delays in paying bills and an inability to access their own money. ""High street banks justify the closure of their branch networks on the basis that they are providing a seamless online and mobile phone banking service. These justifications carry little weight if their banking apps and websites cannot be relied upon. ""The Bank of England has recently announced it will begin to run IT stress tests on banks.

"This video can not be played Gerard Batten tells the UKIP conference: Some people say I have saved the party UKIP should become a ""radical, populist party"" standing up for free speech against the ""politically-correct thought police"", says its leader. Its ""interim manifesto"", unveiled on the eve of its conference, also urges a ""clean exit"" from the EU. Leader Gerard Batten said the policies unveiled aimed to help ""the people who form the backbone of Britain"". He is the fourth person to lead UKIP since Nigel Farage quit in the wake of the 2016 EU Referendum. The party has also suffered a funding crisis and was saved from insolvency by public donations. Under Mr Batten's leadership, membership has increased from a low of around 18,000 to approximately 24,000, according to UKIP, but critics have accused the party of becoming too right-wing. BBC political correspondent Alex Forsyth said UKIP has allowed controversial online video bloggers, to join the party and is considering whether to allow the former English Defence League leader Tommy Robinson to become a member. UKIP 'saved from insolvency' by donations New UKIP leader announces plans to quit Man fined over 'Nazi pug' hate crime Sargon of Akkad and Count Dankula, self-styled You Tube activists and free speech campaigners, will be among those addressing Friday's conference in Birmingham. Aside from Mr Batten, other speakers will include Neil Hamilton, who was ousted earlier this year as leader of the UKIP group in the Welsh Assembly. The party's interim manifesto includes sections on free speech, political correctness and Islamic extremism, as well as the NHS, defence, education and policing among others. It urges a ""complete and total withdrawal from the European Union"", and says UKIP will keep fighting to make the UK an ""independent, self-governing, sovereign state"", regardless of any Brexit deal reached. In it, Mr Batten says UKIP will ""promote and defend our national and individual freedoms"" adding: ""We are determined to protect our freedom of speech and the right to speak our minds without fear of the politically correct thought-police knocking on our doors."" The manifesto covers a wide range of policy areas, from the NHS and transport to fisheries and small businesses, with policies including: A limited points-based immigration system NHS health cards for British citizens to prevent 'health tourism' & free parking at hospitals An extra Â£2bn a year for adult social care & Â£500m a year for mental health Abolition of stamp duty and inheritance tax Introduction of new grammar schools Scrapping the overseas aid budget Scrapping guidelines on 'subjective' hate crimes Scrapping the climate change act, stopping subsidies for wind turbines and solar voltaic arrays and seeking to rejuvenate the UK's coal industry Scrapping the BBC licence fee in favour of voluntary subscription Repealing hate speech guidelines, the Equality Act 2010 & shutting down the Equalities and Human Rights Commission Mr Batten, who took over as leader in February but has said he intends to resign after a year, said: ""These policies are aimed at helping the people who form the backbone of Britain: ordinary workers and taxpayers, the unemployed who would like to work, and small and medium-sized business owners."" ""Its purpose is to make UKIP a populist party in the real meaning of the word - one whose policies are popular with voters."" Paul Nuttall quit in the wake of the 2017 general election The UKIP leader has hit back at claims of growing links between the party and far-right groups, telling Sky News he was ""entitled to speak at rallies organised by people who believe in democracy"". Mr Batten said Tommy Robinson would not be admitted to UKIP ""in the near future"" because it would require changes to the party's rules. But Mr Farage, who has returned to the domestic political fray with a campaign to ""save Brexit"", said UKIP risked ""total and utter marginalisation"" unless it changed direction. He told the Press Association he was ""totally opposed"" to allowing Mr Robinson into the party. ""I wrote very explicitly into the rules of the party when I first became leader: we did not want anybody in the party that had taints with organisations we deemed to be on the far right of British politics,"" he said. ""It really upsets me to see the fact this debate is even taking place."" UKIP, which is marking its 25th anniversary this year, saw its popularity collapse in the 2017 election after securing only 594,068 votes - down from 3,881,099 in 2015. The party leadership has changed hands six times since the 2016 EU referendum, with Mr Farage returning temporarily when his successor Diane James quit after less than a month at the helm. Paul Nuttall succeeded her in November 2016 but quit following the 2017 general election - and Steve Crowther became acting leader. Henry Bolton was elected leader in September 2017 but was ousted following controversy over racist messages sent by his partner.

"Rovers 1A and 1B (left and centre), alongside Minerva II-2 (right) which will be released at a later date Two robotic explorers are descending to the surface of an asteroid. Japan's Hayabusa-2 spacecraft despatched a pair of ""rovers"" to the 1km-wide space rock known as Ryugu. If all goes well, Hayabusa-2 will be the first spacecraft to successfully place robot rovers on the surface of an asteroid. Rover 1A and Rover 1B will move around by hopping in Ryugu's low gravity; they will capture images of the surface and measure temperatures. Hayabusa-2 reached the asteroid Ryugu in June this year after a three-and-a-half-year journey. The 1km-wide space rock known formally as 162173 Ryugu belongs to a particularly primitive type of asteroid, and is therefore a relic left over from the early days of our Solar System. Studying it could shed light on the origin and evolution of our own planet. The rovers are stored in drum-shaped container at the base of the Hayabusa-2 ""mothership"". Collectively, they form a 3.3kg science package known as Minerva II-1. The Minerva II-1 rovers move by hopping around in Ryugu's low gravity Early on Thursday morning (BST), Hayabusa-2 began descending towards the surface of Ryugu in preparation for the deployment. At around 0500 BST on Friday (1pm JST) - at a distance from the asteroid of about 60m - Hayabusa-2 initiated the release of the two robots. Japanese space agency officials said that when the front of the drum is jettisoned into space, the two rovers are then ejected from the container and fall independently to the surface of the asteroid. The 1kg autonomous rovers move about by hopping, using the asteroid's low gravity. Each one contains a motor-powered internal mass that rotates to generate force, propelling the robot across the surface. They're equipped with wide-angle and stereo cameras to send back pictures from Ryugu. Spine-like projections from the edges of the hoppers are sensors that will measure surface temperatures on the asteroid. Dates set for touchdown on an asteroid Japanese spacecraft reaches cosmic 'diamond' Hayabusa-2 arrived at the asteroid 162173 Ryugu in June They will send back their data to the mothership, which will then relay the information to Earth. One of the principal concerns for deployment is the rougher-than-expected surface of Ryugu, which is carpeted with boulders with very few smooth patches. The name Minerva comes from a detachable mini-lander carried on the first Hayabusa spacecraft, which explored a different asteroid - 25143 Itokawa - in the mid-2000s. However, a glitch during the deployment meant that little lander never reached its target. Officials and scientists from the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency (Jaxa), which operates Hayabusa-2, will be hoping for better luck this time. Hayabusa-2 was launched from the Tanegashima Launch Center in far southern Japan on 3 December 2014. It has been carrying several science instrument payloads for release on to the surface of its target, Ryugu. The Mascot lander was built by the German Aerospace Center in conjunction with the French Space Agency On 3 October, the mothership will deploy a lander called Mascot, which has been developed by the German Aerospace Center (DLR) together with the French Space Agency (CNES). And in late October, Hayabusa-2 will descend to the surface of Ryugu to collect a sample of rock and soil. Even further on in the mission, Jaxa plans to detonate an explosive charge that will punch a crater into the surface of Ryugu. Hayabusa-2 would then descend into the crater to collect fresh rocks that have not been altered by aeons of exposure to the environment of space. These samples will then be sent to Earth for laboratory studies. The spacecraft will depart from Ryugu in December 2019 with the intention of returning to Earth with the asteroid samples in 2020.

"The sanctions relate to China's purchase of 10 Russian Sukhoi Su-35 fighter jets The US has imposed sanctions on the Chinese military over its purchasing of Russian military jets and surface-to-air missiles. It says such purchases contravene US sanctions on Moscow introduced over Russian actions in Ukraine and alleged interference in US politics. China recently bought 10 Russian Sukhoi Su-35 fighter jets and S-400 missiles. Beijing has not joined in the sanctions imposed on Moscow by the US and its Western allies since 2014. Its forces took part in giant Russian war games held earlier this month. Sanctions: What are they and why do countries use them? Relations between the US and Russia deteriorated rapidly after Moscow annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. Russia's alleged meddling in the 2016 American presidential election and military involvement in Syria's ongoing civil war increased tensions. China's Equipment Development Department (EDD) and its head, Li Shangfu, are sanctioned for completing ""significant transactions"" with Russia's state arms exporter, Rosoboronexport. The EDD and Mr Li have been added to a Blocked Persons List,external, meaning any assets they hold in the US are frozen and Americans are ""generally prohibited"" from doing business with them. Furthermore, the EDD is denied export licences and excluded from the American financial system. Washington also blacklisted an additional 33 people and entities associated with Russian military and intelligence. The  Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (Caatsa) was passed in 2017 to provide the Trump administration with the necessary means to target Russia, Iran and North Korea with economic and political sanctions. US President Donald Trump issued an executive order on Thursday intended to allow the sanctions to be implemented. The Trump-Russia saga in 200 words US punishes Russians over vote meddling ""The ultimate target of these sanctions is Russia,"" a senior administration official told journalists. ""Caatsa sanctions in this context are not intended to undermine the defence capabilities of any particular country"" but are ""aimed at imposing costs on Russia in response to its malign activities"". Similar action against other countries would be considered, Washington added. A Russian S-400 anti-aircraft weapon system in Crimea A politician in Moscow said the US sanctions would have no impact on the sales of its fighter jets and missiles. ""I am sure that these contracts will be executed in line with the schedule,"" Franz Klintsevich, a Russian member of parliament, was quoted as saying by Russia's Interfax news agency. Russia's new military - should Nato worry? ""The possession of this of this military equipment is very important for China,"" he added. Asia is the most important foreign market for Russian arms producers, reportedly accounting for 70% of their exports since 2000. India, China and Vietnam are the principal sources of demand for Russian weapons in the region, according to a recent Chatham House report. US and Russia: What are sanctions?

"The consumer watchdog says universities need to make sure marketing information is reliable Universities have been warned against making ""potentially misleading claims"" in their advertising. The Which? consumer group says some universities are claiming high status without any ""verifiable"" evidence. The Advertising Standards Authority last year told universitiesthey must take down unsubstantiated claims, such as being in the top 1% in the world. But Alex Hayman of Which? University said some institutions were still ""falling short"" in their adverts. With universities beginning another round of recruitment for next year, the consumer group has highlighted concerns about the quality of information for students considering their applications. Shakira Martin, president of the National Union of Students, blamed ""marketisation"" for encouraging universities to make claims to ""boost their chances of acquiring higher numbers of students and ultimately more money"". There have been six universities challenged by Which? over their marketing information. Newcastle University's claim that it was in the top 1% in the world was questioned - and in response the university has taken down the claim, accepting it was ""not a particularly meaningful statistic"". Universities have interpreted league table rankings in their marketing As with other similar claims, it was an interpretation based on one of the various university ranking lists. Aston University's assertion it was ""ranked within the top 35 universities in all university ranking tables"" was challenged. The university said there was no intention to ""confuse prospective students"" and this included measures of employability - but to avoid any ambiguity it would be taken down from the website. Aberdeen University was challenged over the evidence for being ""ranked consistently among the world's top universities"". The university says league tables show it is ""highly ranked in the world"", but says it will ""enhance"" its website with extra information to clarify the claim. But Heriot-Watt University rejected queries about it being a ""world-leading university for pioneering research informed by the needs of business and industry"". The university said its research and international partnerships with industry made it an institution of ""global significance and reputation"". The University of the West of Scotland stands by its claim to be in the ""top 3% of universities worldwide"" - saying that this is based on the Times Higher Education league table, where it is ranked between 501st and 600th place. The University of Ulster says its claim to be ""in the top 2% of universities in the world is based on the total number of higher education institutions worldwide, rather than the number ranked in each of the global rankings"". Mr Hayman of Which? University said: ""It is critical that prospective students can trust the facts that higher education institutions are putting forward."" But he warned that this research raised questions about whether universities were fully complying with the warnings last year from the Advertising Standards Authority. The advertising standards watchdog says the ""vast majority of universities are sticking to our rules"". It added: ""We will carefully consider the findings of the report before deciding if any further action is necessary."" ""University marketing departments must take this issue seriously,"" said Nicola Dandridge, chief executive of the higher education regulator, the Office for Students. ""It is essential that universities ensure that their marketing material is accurate, otherwise students will be misled.""

"A suspected IS member and her baby were handed over to Sudanese diplomats in north-eastern Syria on Thursday, reports say Captured foreign Islamic State militants must be taken back by their home countries, the Kurdish-led forces in north-eastern Syria have said. The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) said it would not put them on trial themselves and lacked the resources to hold them indefinitely. The SDF, which controls the region, say they hold about 500 jihadists, and hundreds of their wives and children. The captured IS fighters are reported to be from dozens of countries. States that the IS jihadists came from have proven to be reluctant to take these dangerous men back, the BBC's Middle East analyst, Alan Johnston, says. IS militants seized large areas in Syria and Iraq in 2014 - but have seen been driven out from most the captured territory. The SDF is being backed by the US-led coalition. How real is the threat of returning IS fighters? Why is there a war in Syria? On Thursday, Kurdish foreign affairs official Abdel Karim Omar said that ""around 520 Daesh [IS] mercenaries, as well as 550 women and around 1,200 children from 44 countries"" were in the SDF's custody, AFP news agency reports. ""It's a heavy burden that we can't carry alone. ""We will not try any IS fighter... We are trying as much as possible... to pressure governments to carry out their duties and take their citizens back.""

"Annie Kenney (left), with Christabel Pankhurst, was worried about her family's reaction to her jailing A previously unknown letter from the first suffragette to be jailed in the campaign for the vote has been discovered by an Oxford historian. Written the day after Annie Kenney was released from prison in Manchester in 1905, it is being claimed as the earliest known letter from a woman involved in the militant protests. The letter, to her sister, was found in an archive in Canada. ""We don't have anything like this before,"" said Lyndsey Jenkins. The historian was researching the Kenney family when she found the previously unrecognised letter in an archive in Canada - where Annie Kenney's sister had later emigrated. ""This is the first account by a woman about what it's like to go to prison for the vote,"" Ms Jenkins told the BBC. ""At this moment, they don't know what's going to happen, that they're going to be successful. ""She's risked everything. This could be the worst mistake of her life. She doesn't know there's going to be a positive reaction,"" said Ms Jenkins, a history lecturer at the University of Oxford. Annie Kenney wrote to her sister after she was imprisoned in 1905 ""Going to prison was an incredibly difficult step for these women. It's a really shocking thing to do, a very radical move. They don't know it's going to pay off."" Annie Kenney was a working-class woman from Oldham, who had worked in a cotton mill from the age of 10. Her role in the suffragettes' struggle had often been downplayed, said Ms Jenkins, compared with the attention paid to better connected families such as the Pankhursts. She played a prominent part in the suffragettes' campaign, effectively leading it between 1912 and 1914. The suffragette was jailed several times and took part in hunger strikes. But, Ms Jenkins said, her contribution was ""often underestimated and poorly understood"". Annie Kenney's jailing was seen as a pivotal moment in the campaign for the vote - when the suffragettes moved towards more radical, direct protest. With Christabel Pankhurst, they disrupted a government minister's public meeting, demanding answers on when women would have the right to vote. Suffragettes began to take a more militant approach to protests They were thrown out and Christabel Pankhurst accused of spitting at a policeman - and the two women were jailed. ""The impact was immediate and international,"" said Ms Jenkins, with the protest putting the suffragettes' campaign on to front pages around the world. The protest and the jailing, now seen as the starting point of militant action, also saw the launch of the ""Votes for Women"" placards, described by Oxford University as ""one of the most memorable political slogans of all time"". The letter written by Annie Kenney to her sister Nell was sent from the Pankhurst house in Nelson Street in Manchester. She breaks the news of what has happened by saying: ""You may be surprised when I tell you I was released from Strangeways yesterday morning."" The first page of Annie Kenney's letter from 1905 Annie Kenney says she knows another of her sisters is ""awfully angry"" but there were a hundred people to greet her when she left prison and another 2,000 supporters had gathered to hear speeches at a Manchester protest meeting. ""Manchester is alive I can assure you,"" she tells her sister. But this was also a working-class family that had to think about practicalities as well as politics. After describing her release from prison - getting a bouquet from the ""Oldham Socialists"" - she reassures her sister: ""I am able to send money home every week."" The letter, on loan from the British Columbia Archives, will be put on display at Gallery Oldham from 29 September.

"This video can not be played Theresa May says hers is the ""only plan on the table"" that could achieve a frictionless Irish border Theresa May has just tried to put a brave face on it. Number 10 had not hoped for a breakthrough at this summit in Salzburg. But they were confident of getting a fair wind for the controversial compromise she agreed with her Cabinet in the heat of the summer. Mrs May has just told a clammy, tiny room full of journalists: ""I believe that there is willingness to do a deal but let nobody be in any doubt, that as I've always said, we are preparing for no deal."" But the comments from President of the European Council Donald Tusk give a pretty bleak assessment of the UK's plan. Tusk: May's Brexit plan won't work He and other EU leaders have expressed doubts before. But his bold comments only minutes after a private meeting with Mrs May that the plan ""does not work"", are more stark, and more damaging than expected. That's because Donald Tusk has been seen as one of those brokers in the Brexit talks who has been trying to make things work, and trying to urge others who are more reluctant to do so, to show the UK a little flexibility. Can the prime minister really cling on to her Chequers plan now? The EU clearly won't accept it as it stands. Significant chunks of her party won't wear the deal either. The opposition parties won't back her. Of course there are tactics at play here. One government minister has already suggested that the EU always knows how to overplay their hand. Sometimes in negotiations, there needs to be a crisis to focus minds. And in her press conference, Theresa May seemed frustrated that her proposals perhaps have not been properly digested or considered yet. Of course this is only one day, one set of fraught meetings, in a tangled and lengthy process. But as things stand, it seems Theresa May is going to have to budge, or walk away.

"This video can not be played Donald Tusk: UK's Chequers Brexit plan 'won't work' Theresa May's proposed new economic partnership with the EU ""will not work"", the head of the European Council has said. Donald Tusk said the plans risked undermining the EU's single market. He was speaking at the end of an EU summit in Salzburg where leaders of the 27 remaining member states discussed Brexit. Mrs May said her proposals were the ""only serious credible"" way to avoid a hard border in Northern Ireland. She said she had held ""frank"" talks with Mr Tusk, adding: ""Yes, concerns have been raised and I want to know what those concerns are."" There was ""a lot of hard work to be done"", she said, but added that the UK was also making preparations in case no deal could be reached. Mrs May reiterated that she would not accept the EU's ""backstop"" plan to avoid a hard border in Northern Ireland, and said the UK would shortly be bringing forward its own proposals. Katya Adler: What just happened in Salzburg? EU must 'evolve' Irish plans, insists May Sturgeon calls for Brexit to be delayed Brexit: All you need to know Europeâs press fear a hard Brexit The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019, and both sides are trying to reach a deal in time. There is still no agreement on some issues, including how to avoid new checks on the Northern Ireland-Republic of Ireland border. At a press conference, Mr Tusk said there were some ""positive elements"" in the UK's blueprint for future relations with the EU, which was agreed by ministers at Chequers in July. But, he added: ""The suggested framework for economic cooperation will not work."" Mr Tusk added that October would be the ""moment of truth"" for reaching a deal, and that ""if the conditions are there"" an additional summit would be held in November to ""formalise"" it.

Read the rest of Laura's blog The EU leaders had been discussing the UK's plans, which were presented to them by Mrs May on Wednesday evening. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said ""substantial progress"" was needed on the UK's withdrawal agreement by the next European Council meeting in October, with ""still a large piece of work"" on the separate issue of future trade relations with the UK. The 27 remaining EU members were ""united that, in the matter of the single market, there can be no compromises,"" she said. French President Emmanuel Macron said Brexit had been ""pushed by certain people who predicted easy solutions"". He added: ""Brexit has shown us one thing - and I fully respect British sovereignty in saying this - it has demonstrated that those who said you can easily do without Europe, that it will all go very well, that it is easy and there will be lots of money, are liars. ""This is all the more true because they left the next day, so they didn't have to manage it."" Theresa May presented her Brexit plans to EU leaders on Wednesday evening As well the criticism from the EU, Mrs May's proposal for the UK to sign up to a common rule book for trade in goods and a combined customs territory with the EU is unpopular with many in her own party, who believe it will erode British sovereignty and is not what people voted for when they backed Brexit in the 2016 referendum. Former Brexit secretary David Davis said although EU leaders ""were trying to give some warm words"" it was now going to be ""very, very difficult"" to meet their requirements: ""So it's time for a reset, time for a rethink"". And another prominent Brexiteer, Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg, said Mr Tusk's remarks signalled the end for the Chequers proposals. Please upgrade your browser ""I think Chequers now has no supporters at all,"" he told the BBC. ""I think the time has come for Mrs May to say 'This is not going to work'."" For Labour, shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said Mrs May had to ""urgently drop her reckless red lines and put forward a credible plan for Brexit"". But DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds blamed the EU for its ""unreasonable and inflexible approach"" adding: ""The UK government must demonstrate a resolute determination not to be bullied."" He said preserving the ""political, constitutional and economic integrity of the United Kingdom"" was the ""absolute priority for us"". Earlier Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said Mrs May must delay Brexit beyond next March if there is not a detailed agreement on future trading arrangements.

"Theresa May's Chequers plan was rejected by EU leaders at their Salzburg summit The UK government insists Theresa May's Brexit proposal is a ""workable, credible"" deal, despite being rejected by EU leaders at a summit in Salzburg. Minister James Brokenshire said ""tough words"" were to be expected near the end of negotiations but the government was ""resolute"" in its bid to get a deal. He said the so-called Chequers plan ""does deliver"" and it was now for the EU to ""be specific"" about its concerns. The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. Prime Minister Theresa May says her plan for the UK and EU to share a ""common rulebook"" for goods, but not services, is the only credible way to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Katya Adler: What just happened in Salzburg? Tusk: May's plan won't work Sturgeon calls for Brexit to be delayed Brexit: All you need to know But it is opposed by some within her own party who argue it would compromise the UK's sovereignty, and got a cool reception at this week's EU summit in Salzburg, Austria. Mrs May described her talks there with European Council President Donald Tusk as ""frank"". In a news conference, Mr Tusk said that while there were some ""positive elements"" in the Chequers plan, EU leaders had agreed that the proposals needed to be redrawn: ""The suggested framework for economic co-operation will not work, not least because it is undermining the single market."" He followed it up by posting a photograph on Instagram of he and Mrs May looking at cakes with the caption: ""A piece of cake, perhaps? Sorry, no cherries."" The EU has argued that the UK cannot ""cherry-pick"" elements from its rulebook. What's behind Tusk's Instagram diplomacy? On Friday, Communities Secretary Mr Brokenshire, a former Northern Ireland Secretary, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""The Chequers deal is a workable, credible deal to meet our ambitions. ""They [the EU] have said that it's about the integrity of the single market and we believe the Chequers deal responds to that, and it's for the EU to engage with what's on the table."" This video can not be played Chris Grayling: EU's position on Irish border 'simply impossible to accept' But former cabinet minister Iain Duncan Smith, who campaigned for Brexit, questioned why the UK had gone for a plan which ""was so obviously not going to cut the mustard with the EU"". He added that the EU had ""behaved appallingly"" towards Mrs May and he described Mr Tusk's Instagram photograph as ""quite insulting"". The UK and EU are trying to reach a deal in time and want to avoid a hard border - physical infrastructure like cameras or guard posts - between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic but cannot agree on how. The EU insists on its own ""legally binding Irish backstop"" - what it describes as an insurance policy to prevent a hard border, if no other solution can be found. By BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg Theresa May and her government have been trying to pursue a middle way, to find a stance between the basic options - a close ""Norway style"", or free trade deal roughly like Canada. It feels that the search for something else has been in vain. Sources on the EU side express irritation at the UK's approach, at what they see as the strident tone the prime minister took in the last 48 hours. The European Council is not the same as Prime Minister's Questions, it's suggested. But to kick out publicly as they did in Salzburg certainly runs the risk of pushing Mrs May too far. Read more from Laura. It suggests Northern Ireland should stay aligned with the EU in key areas, in effect staying in the customs union and single market. But the UK says this is unacceptable as it would split Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK. Transport Secretary Chris Grayling told BBC Newsnight: ""At the moment what the European Union is asking in and around Northern Ireland is simply impossible for any UK government to accept. And actually if they stick with that position, there will be no deal."" Mrs May has said the UK will come forward ""shortly"" with new proposals on the so-called ""backstop"" arrangements, but also insisted Chequers was the ""only serious and credible proposition"" for an overall deal. Please upgrade your browser Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeontweeted,external: ""Now that the EU has explicitly rejected it, the Chequers pretence has to stop. ""At the very least, single market/customs union membership must be back on the table and the Article 50 clock [the time-limited process taking Britain out of the EU] must be stopped to avoid a cliff edge."" Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer told the BBC that if the negotiations ended without a deal, it ""would be catastrophic for our economy, plunging it into real crisis"". ""Really, the next few weeks should be all about how does the prime minister avoid that,"" he told the BBC. ""She needs to accept that we need a customs union and a strong single market deal, both for the Northern Ireland border and for our economy."" Leading Conservative Remainer Dominic Grieve said he believed a deal would be offered but one that would be ""very difficult"" for the UK to accept - ""which is why we are going to have to reconsider what we are doing"". He said the EU could only show limited flexibility towards a non-member: ""We are asking for something that the EU, as an international treaty organisation, cannot readily give us."" Mr Tusk said on Thursday that October would be the ""moment of truth"" for reaching a deal, and that ""if the conditions are there"" an additional summit would be held in November to ""formalise"" it. Meanwhile, pro-European Scottish politicians seeking a ruling on whether Brexit can be halted have beengiven permission to take their case to Europe's highest court. The cross-party group of politicians argue that Article 50 can be revoked if MPs vote to do so. They won an appeal at the Court of Session in Edinburgh, Scotland's highest court, and the European Court of Justice will be asked to give a definitive ruling.

"This video can not be played Sheriff Jeff Gahler said there had been multiple fatalities and multiple people wounded A woman shot dead three people and injured three more before turning a gun on herself in an attack at a warehouse complex in Maryland, US police say. The shooting happened on Thursday morning at a pharmacy distribution centre in Perryman, near Baltimore. The attacker, Snochia Moseley, 26, died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. The motive for her attack is unclear. Mass shootings by women are rare, with more than 95% of such attacks in the US carried out by men. The victims who died included Sunday Aguda, 45, Brindra Giri, 41, and Hayleen Reyes, 41, police said on Friday. The shooter was a temporary employee who reported for work as usual that morning, Harford County Sheriff's Office said. But shortly after 09:00 local time (13:00 GMT) she began shooting outside, then inside the facility, with a 9mm Glock handgun that she had brought with her. Police were on the scene within five minutes, by which time the shooter had killed three people and injured three more. Officers found the suspect in a critical condition, with a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head - she died later in hospital. She was from Baltimore County, police said. She legally owned and had registered the handgun, and had taken several magazines of ammunition with her, police said. The sheriff's office initially urged residents to avoid the area, which is about 40km (25 miles) north-east of Baltimore, as hundreds of employees evacuated the facility and nearby buildings. FBI agents were deployed to the scene just minutes after the shooting Investigators say the suspect was ""suffering from a mental illness and over the last two weeks had become increasingly agitated"". They say she had been employed at the facility for less than two weeks before the attack. She had no criminal arrest record, but had her car stopped three times in the area in just the past month. The suspect was issued tickets for not having proper vehicle registration, among other infractions,according to the Baltimore Sun newspaper,external. Authorities have described her as ""disgruntled"". A school friend told the newspaper that she was not an angry person but felt the ""world was against her"".

"Judge Kavanaugh is accused of sexually assaulting a woman in the 1980s, when they were both teenagers. A woman who accuses Supreme Court pick Brett Kavanaugh of trying to rape her in 1982 has offered to testify to the Senate if it can ""ensure her safety"". Christine Blasey Ford's lawyer says her client will not appear on Monday, as senators proposed, but might do so next week on ""terms that are fair"". Republicans had vowed to press ahead with the confirmation amid uncertainty over whether the accuser would testify. Judge Kavanaugh has issued a fresh rebuttal of the allegation. The truth about false assault accusations Kavanaugh accuser 'faces death threats' Could Kavanaugh confirmation be derailed? Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley welcomed Prof Ford's offer. This video can not be played Why it can take sexual assault allegations years to come out ""We are happy that Dr Ford's attorneys are now engaging with the Committee,"" his spokesperson told US media. Thursday's development came on the eve ofa Republican-set deadlinefor Prof Ford to decide whether she would give evidence. Judge Kavanaugh, 53, has agreed to testify to the judiciary committee, which vets Supreme Court nominees, on Monday. ""Since the moment I first heard the allegation,"" he said in a statement on Thursday, ""I have categorically and unequivocally denied it. I remain committed to defending my integrity."" The California psychology lecturer's legal team emailed the panel's staff on Thursday. Debra Katz, the lawyer, wrote that she wished to ""discuss the conditions under which [Prof Ford] would be prepared to testify next week"". ""As you are aware, she's been receiving death threats which have been reported to the FBI and she and her family have been forced out of their home."" This video can not be played Alumni of Ford's school: 'We believe her' She continued: ""She wishes to testify, provided that we can agree on terms that are fair and which ensure her safety."" But she ruled out any testimony next Monday, calling the date ""arbitrary"". The attorney said her client would prefer to wait for the FBI to investigate the accusation before agreeing to testify. But US President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans have already ruled that out. The FBI investigated a sexual harassment claim against a Supreme Court nominee in 1991 at the behest of the White House, finishing that inquiry in three days. Capitol Police arrested 56 people on Thursday in anti-Kavanaugh protests Senior Republican Senator John Cornyn of Texas told CNN: ""If she doesn't want to participate and tell her story, there's no reason for us to delay."" Senator Dean Heller, a Nevada Republican, sounded bullish about the prospects of confirming the nominee, who would be expected to bring a more conservative tilt to America's highest court. ""We got a little hiccup here with the Kavanaugh nomination, we'll get through this and we'll get off to the races,"" he said in a call with fellow Republicans, the Nevada Independent reports. Why is the US top court so important? Meet the Supremes - who are the justices? A petition backing Prof Ford, signed by more than 1,000 alumnae from Holton-Arms, her former Maryland high school, was delivered on Thursday to two Democratic women senators. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, a New York Democrat, said at the event: ""Someone who is lying does not ask the FBI to investigate their claims. ""Judge Kavanaugh has not asked to have the FBI investigate these claims. Is that the reaction of an innocent person? It is not."" Prof Ford says Brett Kavanaugh pinned her to a bed and tried to take off her clothes On Thursday, 56 people were arrested while attending anti-Kavanaugh protests on Capitol Hill. The mostly female demonstrators wore pins reading: ""I believe Christine Blasey Ford."" Protesters occupied the office of Senator Chuck Grassley on Thursday Twelve of Prof Ford's family members have written an open letter, posted on Twitter, in which they call her ""highly ethical"", adding that ""her honesty is above reproach"". ""Chrissy is not someone who chooses to be in the spotlight,"" the letter said. Prof Ford has accused Judge Kavanaugh of drunkenly pinning her to a bed and trying to remove her clothing at a house party in a Washington DC suburb when they were both teenagers 36 years ago.
