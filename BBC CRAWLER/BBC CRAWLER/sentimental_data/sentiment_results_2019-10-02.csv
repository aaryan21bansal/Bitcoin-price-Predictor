"This video can not be played Stand-off between Trump and reporter on Ukraine phone call US President Donald Trump has lashed out at congressional Democrats after they vowed to summons the White House to produce documents this week. Committees are demanding documents relating to the administration's dealings with Ukraine, which is now at the heart of an impeachment inquiry. The president accused Democratic leaders of dishonesty and even treason. Democrats have defended the inquiry - which focuses on a phone call between Mr Trump and the Ukrainian president. Warning: this report contains strong language During a joint news conference with Finnish President Sauli NiinistÃ¶, Mr Trump called Mr Biden and his son, Hunter, ""stone-cold corrupt"". Mr Trump directed much of his anger towards House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, calling him ""shifty Schiff, ""a lowlife"" and saying he ""should resign from office in disgrace"". He added: ""Frankly, they should look at him for treason."" Mr Trump also stated that he believed Mr Schiff had ""helped write"" a complaint about the call filed by a whistleblower, without offering evidence. Impeachment inquiry explained - in short and long form Who's who in Trump whistleblower story? The US president told reporters that only ""legitimate"" whistleblowers should be protected. ""This country has to find out who this person was, because that person's a spy, in my opinion,"" Mr Trump said. He labelled the entire inquiry a ""hoax"" and a ""fraudulent crime on the American people"" while maintaining he would ""always co-operate"" with Congress. This video can not be played Who is Rudy Giuliani? The US president also sparred at the White House with a Reuters correspondent, who asked him what he considered treasonous. As the Finnish leader looked on, Mr Trump said ""there are those who think I'm a very stable genius"" and said he ""probably will be bringing a lot of litigation"" against those who participated in the Russia investigation. When the reporter pressed Mr Trump, the US president cut him off, saying: ""Don't be rude."" Earlier, Mr Trump raged at the most powerful elected Democrat, House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and Mr Schiff on Twitter, accusing Democrats of focusing on ""BULLSHIT"".

Mr Trump said Mrs Pelosi should focus on her own city, San Francisco, which he described as a ""tent city"" of homeless people. The impeachment inquiry - which may seek to remove Mr Trump from office - stems from the whistleblower's complaint about his 25 July phone conversation with President Volodymyr Zelensky. Analysis: Dissecting Trump's Ukraine phone calls Pompeo confirms he heard Trump-Ukraine call In the call, Mr Trump pressed for an investigation of his Democratic political rival Joe Biden and his son, who worked for a Ukrainian gas firm that faced allegations of corruption. As vice-president and the Obama administration's point man on Ukraine, Mr Biden threatened to withhold US loan guarantees to the country unless it fired its top prosecutor, at a time when Hunter Biden's employer had been under official scrutiny. But European countries and international bodies had also wanted Viktor Shokin fired, accusing him of failing to clamp down on corruption. The Ukrainian prosecutor general who took over from Mr Shokin has told the BBC there was no evidence of wrongdoing by Joe or Hunter Biden. However, questions were raised at the time about a potential conflict of interest for the US vice-president. Democrats have pointed out Mr Trump's call with the newly elected Mr Zelensky took place at the same time as the US president decided to withhold military aid from Ukraine. From what has been shared of the call so far, Mr Trump did not directly reference withholding aid, but a full verbatim transcript has not been made available. Mr Trump's opponents say he was pressuring a vulnerable American ally to interfere in the 2020 US election for the US president's personal benefit. Democrats have accused the White House of blocking congressional inquiries and refusing to respond to record requests, which has prompted the subpoena threat this week. House oversight committee chairman Elijah Cummings said in a memo: ""I do not take this step lightly. ""Over the past several weeks, the committees tried several times to obtain voluntary compliance with our requests for documents, but the White House has refused to engage with - or even respond to - the committees."" The subpoena will request documents on Mr Trump's call with Ukraine and any related items from acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney. House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff and Speaker Nancy Pelosi defended the impeachment inquiry Mrs Pelosi and Mr Schiff held a joint news conference on Wednesday, defending the impeachment proceedings. ""We're not fooling around here,"" Mr Schiff said, adding that Democrats did not want the inquiry to ""drag on"". He also criticised the president's comments against the whistleblower as ""a blatant effort to intimidate witnesses"" and ""an incitement of violence"". Mr Schiff has also issued a statement saying his committee never reviewed or received the whistleblower's complaint in advance, as Mr Trump claimed. Impeachment is the first part - the charges - of a two-stage political process by which Congress can remove a president from office If the House of Representatives votes to pass articles of impeachment, the Senate is forced to hold a trial A Senate vote requires a two-thirds majority to convict - unlikely in this case, given that Mr Trump's party controls the chamber Only two US presidents in history - Bill Clinton and Andrew Johnson - have been impeached but neither was convicted and removed President Nixon resigned before he could have been impeached How could Trump be impeached?

"Hilary Simmons (right) collapsed less than half an hour after the confrontation A Tesco worker collapsed and died after an altercation with a shoplifter, an inquest has heard. Hilary Simmons, 59, was taken ill at a Tesco Express store on Corporation Road in Middlesbrough on 30 April 2018. A pathologist concluded the stress of the confrontation ""directly contributed to her death"", but not to a criminal standard. A post-mortem exam found she was suffering from heart disease which could have caused death at any time. The inquest, at Teesside Coroner's Court, heard shoplifter Michael James Love was later convicted of theft. Giving evidence, Mr Love said he had concealed a bottle of wine inside his jacket but was challenged by Mrs Simmons. In his police interview, he claimed she shouted and swore at him and alleged that she pushed him, though this was denied by other witnesses. He denied pushing her and claimed he had wanted to leave but Mrs Simmons stopped him, which was also disputed by other witnesses. Hilary Simmons was taken ill soon after the incident at the Tesco Express store The jury was played CCTV footage from the store's cameras which showed Mr Love and another man leaving the store ahead of Mrs Simmons. The mother of two then appears to be speaking to them on the street outside. Afterwards, Mrs Simmons, from Ingleby Barwick, began to feel unwell and told colleagues: ""I feel like I'm having a heart attack."" She collapsed less than half an hour later and died that evening at James Cook University Hospital in Middlesbrough. Mr Love was questioned by Cleveland Police on suspicion of manslaughter but this was not taken further, the inquest jury heard. Since Mrs Simmons death, Tesco has employed a security guard at the store and the court heard staff were told not to confront thieves. The inquest continues.

"The UK government has announced a ban on some drug exports to protect NHS patients' access to medicines. The 24 medicines affected include hormone replacement therapy drugs, contraceptives and adrenaline pens. The move comes aftera survey of local pharmacists found shortages of every major type of medicine,externalin the past six months. Ministers said the restrictions were not linked to Brexit and medicine shortages did occasionally occur. Pharmaceutical industry leaders welcomed the move, saying stockpiles of medicines would now be better protected and available for NHS use only. The government restrictions will stop wholesalers selling some medicines meant for UK patients for a higher price in another country, potentially causing or worsening supply problems. The drugs on the export ban list,externalinclude 19 HRT drugs and five other medicines, includingall adrenaline pens for severe allergies, hepatitis B vaccines and a number of contraceptives. About 360,000 prescriptions of HRT, which relieve symptoms of the menopause, are dispensed every month, But these drugs, along with contraceptives and anti-epileptic drugs, are in short supply, according to a UK-wide survey of 402 community pharmacies by the Chemist and Druggist. The government has also introduced a ""serious shortage protocol"" for the antidepressant Fluoxetine, which allows pharmacists to give patients an alternative strength or form of the drug because of temporary shortages of some doses. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: ""I know how distressing medicine shortages can be for those who rely on drugs like HRT and it is absolutely crucial patients can always access safe and effective treatments through the NHS."" The new measures would help ""ensure patients get the medicines they need"", he added. Dr Rick Greville, from the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry, said: ""It means that these stockpiles of medicines which companies have built over previous months are better protected and available for use only by the NHS patients for which they were intended. ""Companies can now work with the [health] department to identify any problem areas."" This is an unprecedented move for the UK. Some other EU countries have considered such action or implemented measures in the past to stop the flow of drugs out of their countries. The Greek authorities, for example, banned exports during the financial crisis. But it's the first time the government has decided the risk of shortages for NHS patients requires intervention to protect supplies. UK wholesalers with regulatory licences have the right to move stocks of drugs to sell in other European markets if they wish. The incentive to do so in the eurozone increases as the pound weakens. Now, they have been told they will lose those licences if they shift products elsewhere. Officials say the risk of the UK leaving the European Union without a withdrawal agreement in place is not the reason for the new policy, as shortages do occur from time to time in the medicine markets. But that is certainly the backdrop to the new export ban, as ministers decide action is needed to protect existing supplies. Dr Farah Jameel, from the British Medical Association, said there were lots of different reasons why drugs shortages happened. ""But they are gradually getting worse and can have a serious effect on how quickly patients receive appropriate treatment,"" she said. ""Practices often won't know that a drug is in short supply until patients return from the pharmacy and these extra GP appointments can dramatically add to their already burgeoning workload - as well as distressing patients."" Patients should continue to order their repeat prescriptions and keep taking their medicines as normal - but not ask for more medicines than they need, the Department for Health and Social Care said. It added it was working to ensure the supply of medicines and medical products ""remains uninterrupted after 31 October, [when the UK is set to leave the EU,] whatever the circumstances"". The government has made arrangements to stockpile six weeks' supply of drugs for the NHS in case of a no-deal exit from the EU. But a recent report saidit was not clear exactly what level of stockpiling was in place.

"Proposed laws on domestic abuse are a ""once-in-a-generation opportunity"" to help victims, Theresa May has said in her first speech since resigning as PM. Mrs May's government introduced the Domestic Abuse Bill in July, but its progress was halted when Prime Minister Boris Johnson suspended Parliament. The bill is now having its second reading after the Commons resumed business. Campaigners said the bill was missing key elements to protect victims. During the debate, Labour MP Rosie Duffield received a standing ovation after telling MPs about her own experience of domestic abuse. 'My violent boyfriend tied a noose around my neck' New domestic abuse strategy trialled by councils Almost 1,000 told about partner's abusive past Speaking from the backbenches for the first time since 1998, Mrs May described the bill as a ""landmark piece of legislation"". ""It's been described by government, and indeed by charities and others involved with working with the victims of domestic abuse, as a once-in-a-generation opportunity to make sure we take a step change in the approach we take to supporting victims and to dealing with domestic abuse,"" she said. She added that it was ""imperative"" the bill became law, arguing it would ""improve people's lives"". The bill proposes the first government definition of domestic abuse, including financial abuse and controlling and manipulative non-physical behaviour. Ms Duffield, the MP for Canterbury, urged others to come forward if it was safe to do so, after recounting her own experience of coercive control. This video can not be played Labour MP Rosie Duffield: ""Sometimes there are no bruises"" She said misleading depictions appeared on TV that perpetuated stereotypes. ""Housing estates, working-class families, drunk men coming home from the pub, women surrounded by children and a sequence of shouting followed by immediate physical violence or assault,"" she said. ""But the soap opera scenes only tend to focus on one or two aspects of a much bigger and more complex picture."" She said abuse was not only about physical actions, adding ""sometimes there are no bruises"". Almost two million adults in England and Walesare thought to be victims of domestic abuse every year. Local authority spending on refuges fell from Â£31m in 2010 to Â£23m in 2017. Charities say there is a severe lack of services in many places, leading to victims being turned away. Sandra Horley, chief executive of the charity Refuge, said it was ""essential"" that the bill included statutory funding for refuges. ""Women must be able to flee their violent partners and find safety,"" she added. Women's Aid said the bill would only be successful if it was supported by ""substantial funding"" for services. ""The law also leaves behind some of the most vulnerable women with insecure immigration status, who are often barred from accessing help and support,"" Lucy Hadley, the charity's campaigns and public affairs manager, said.

"Global stocks have fallen sharply with the UK's FTSE 100 suffering its worst day in over three-and-a-half years. Theblue-chip index lost over 3%in its worst day since January 2016. US and European stock markets also dropped. The falls came after poor US jobs and manufacturing figures and aWorld Trade Organization decisionpaving the way for $7.5bn in US tariffs on EU goods. Analysts said these factors had sparked fears over the strength of the global economy. In Europe, Germany's main index, the Dax, closed 2.8% lower, while France's Cac 40 lost over 3%. In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended trading 1.9% lower, marking the second day in a row it has lost more than 1%. The S&P 500 fell 1.8% while the Nasdaq, which is largely made up of technology firms, lost 1.6%. On Tuesday, one of the most closely-watched US manufacturing figures,the Institute for Supply Management's (ISM) index,externalof factory activity, dropped to its lowest level since June 2009. Fresh figures on Wednesday showing a slowdown in jobs growth in the private sector in September accelerated concerns over the US economy. ""Given that most other areas in the world aren't covering themselves in economic glory, the fact that the US is having a volatile time makes people a little worried,"" said Ben Kumar, an analyst at Seven Investment Management. Robert Pavlik, chief investment strategist manager at SlateStone Wealth, said the slowdown in China was also driving investors to sell shares. ""It's all adding up to the same thing essentially: worries that the global economy is slowing and giving investors reason to pause and take profits,"" he said. But Mr Kumar said it was too early to be concerned. ""It's hard to tell anything from a one day perspective. ""People have overreacted which does tend to happen.

"Airbus' A380 was unfairly subsidised, WTO says The US has been given the go-ahead to impose tariffs on $7.5bn (Â£6.1bn) of goods it imports from the EU. It is the latest chapter in a 15-year battle between the US and the EU over illegal subsidies for planemakers Airbus and rival Boeing. The World Trade Organization (WTO) ruling will mean tariffs on EU goods ranging from aircraft to cheese, olives and jumpers from 18 October. Brussels has threatened to retaliate similarly against US goods. US trade officials said the tariffs would be set at a 10% rate on aircraft and 25% on agricultural and other items. They have publisheda list of all the items,externalthat will be subject to the additional tariffs, most of which will apply to imports from France, Germany, Spain and the UK. The US said it had the authority to increase the tariffs ""at any time"" or change the products affected. Meanwhile, the two sides are waiting for the WTO to decide on what tariffs the EU can impose against the US in retaliation for US state aid given to Boeing. That ruling is expected next year. The European Commission,which has proposed tariffs on $20bn (Â£15bn) of US goods, said it hopes to reach a settlement. ""But if the US decides to impose WTO authorised countermeasures, it will be pushing the EU into a situation where we will have no other option than do the same,"" the European Commission said. The US first filed the case in 2004, arguing that cheap European loans for Airbus amounted to illegal state subsidies. The WTO decided in favour of the US, which subsequently complained that the EU and certain member countries were not in compliance with the decision, prompting years of further wrangling. The US had sought to impose tariffs on about $11bn in goods. Though the WTO cut that figure to $7.5bn, Wednesday's decision still marks the largest penalty of its kind in the organisation's history. The WTO's dispute settlement body must formally adopt the ruling but is not expected to overturn the decision. US trade officials said the EU's settlement offer came years too late and did not resolve US concerns about ongoing subsidies. Imposing tariffs is intended to produce a better proposal, they added. ""For years, Europe has been providing massive subsidies to Airbus that have seriously injured the US aerospace industry and our workers. ""Finally, after 15 years of litigation, the WTO has confirmed that the United States is entitled to impose countermeasures in response to the EU's illegal subsidies,"" said US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer. He said the US expected to ""enter into negotiations with the European Union aimed at resolving this issue in a way that will benefit American workers."" But governments across the EU, including the UK, called for the dispute to be resolved without the new tax. ""Resorting to tariffs is not in the interests of the UK, EU or US,"" the UK said. ""We are working closely with the US, EU and European partners to support a negotiated settlement to the Airbus and Boeing disputes"". Bruno Le Maire, France's finance minister, said the country was ""ready to respond firmly with our European partners"". ""A friendly resolution to the Boeing/Airbus dispute is the best solution, and all the more so given that Europe could impose sanctions on the US next year,"" he said. Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel said: ""A decision has been made based on international law through which Airbus will be affected unfortunately and we will see how the Americans will react"". German Chancellor Angela Merkel says the EU will watch to see how the US reacts These tariffs are separate to US President Donald Trump's ongoing trade disputes with countries around the world. Those were sparked in March 2018 when his administration announced tariffs of 25% on steel and 10% on aluminium imported into the US. It prompted the EU to impose â¬2.8bn (Â£2.4bn) of duties on US goods such as bourbon whiskey, motorcycles and orange juice last June. Mr Trump is also considering raising import duties on European cars. While the Boeing-Airbus fight pre-dates Mr Trump, another wave of tariffs adds to concerns about global trade, which has slowed significantly amid the many disputes. On Wednesday, Airbus chief executive Guillaume Faury warned that hitting aircraft with the import duties would disrupt the industry, raise costs and hurt the broader economy - including in the US. Airbus chief executive Guillaume Faury warned the tariffs could impact US jobs Close to 40% of Airbus's aircraft-related procurement comes from US aerospace suppliers, which it said it supports 275,000 American jobs in 40 states. ""Airbus is therefore hopeful that the US and the EU will agree to find a negotiated solution before creating serious damage to the aviation industry as well as to trade relations and the global economy,"" Mr Faury said. BBC economics correspondent Andrew Walker said tensions in global trade had already risen since President Trump took office. ""It's worth remembering that the International Monetary Fund and others see trade conflict as one of the biggest risks to the global economic outlook,"" he added.

"Chirivella came on as a 63rd-minute substitute against MK Dons on 25 September Liverpool have been fined Â£200,000 - half of which has been suspended - by the EFL for fielding an ineligible player in their third-round Carabao Cup win against MK Dons last week. Spaniard Pedro Chirivella, 22, who came on as a substitute in the 2-0 victory, did not have international clearance. The EFL said it ""wasn't appropriate"" to expel Liverpool from the competition because of ""mitigating factors"". Liverpool host Arsenal in the fourth round on 29 October. The EFL said Â£100,000 of the fine will be suspended until the end of next season. Liverpool said they ""accept the judgement, outcome and punishment"", which they described as ""proportionate with the technical indiscretion committed"". Midfielder Chirivella needed the paperwork from the Football Association after a loan spell at Spanish side Extremadura last season. The EFL said Liverpool had ""sought the assistance of the Football Association"" before the season, and had been allowed to include Chirivella on the team sheet for Premier League Two games, the under-23 competition. An EFL statement read: ""The club's breach was in part due to the challenges it encountered with securing the correct international clearance, and its subsequent ability to include the player on team sheets despite the lack of clearance. ""As a result the board concluded the most appropriate sanction was a financial penalty."" Liverpool said: ""Even though there were mitigating factors, which were beyond our control or jurisdiction, we believe it appropriate we apologise to the competition's governing body and also to Milton Keynes Dons."" Liverpool must pay the of Â£100,000, plus an additional sanction, if they were to field another ineligible player in the competition before the end of next season.

"The government publishes its Brexit proposals, including plans to replace Irish backstop The plan would see Northern Ireland essentially stay in the European single market for goods, but leave the EU customs union with the rest of the UK This would mean new customs checks between NI and the Irish Republic The Northern Ireland Assembly would have a say over border arrangements The European Commission welcomes progress on regulatory alignment of goods - but still has concerns Addressing the Tory party conference, Mr Johnson says the only alternative to his plan is no deal The government confirms it plans to prorogue Parliament again on Tuesday - ahead of a Queens Speech on October 14 Marie Jackson, Hazel Shearing, Kate Whannel and Martha Buckley Boris Johnson after finishing his conference speech It's been one of those days in the long Brexit process which potentially feels momentous but we probably won't know how momentous until further down the line. Here's a recap of today's events.  The European Parliament's initial response to the UK's proposals is ""not positive"", says its Brexit coordinator Guy Verhofstadt. Emerging from a briefing with the EUâs chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier, he adds a written response will be produced tomorrow. Boris Johnson and his Irish counterpart Leo Varadkar have spoken over the phone this evening. Mr Varadkar, whose support is crucial for any hope of a wider UK-EU agreement, has issued a short statement in response. He suggested the UK's proposals ""do not fully meet the agreed objectives of the backstop"". In other words, they do not go far enough in upholding the integrity of the EU's single market and protecting the peace settlement in Northern Ireland. But he reiterated that he wanted an agreement and he would consult with the European Commission and other member states in the coming days. He said he expected to speak to Mr Johnson again early next week. Laura KuenssbergBBC political editor Seventy days into Boris Johnson's time in office we now know how he wants to change Theresa May's deal with the European Union. What we don't know, and he doesn't know, is whether his counterparts on the continent have the faintest intention of letting him do so. At the highest levels of government there is a belief that senior figures in the EU, even in Dublin, were certainly willing to contemplatea set of plans,externallike this. But those polite promises to consider became less firm when MPs voted to make it much harder to leave without a deal. Read Laura's full bloghere. BBC News Channel Boris Johnson's proposal moves us into ""completely uncharted territory"" when it comes to customs, says customs consultant Dr Anna Jerzewska ""Both in terms of having two borders and splitting the border functions between a customs border and a regulatory border, and having two instead of one, as well as what's going to happen to Northern Ireland in general,"" she explains. ""The last element of this is that none of it is currently possible under the  EU customs legislation."" She adds: ""One of the commitments that the UK has made is no hard border in Ireland. In terms of customs procedure, this proposal is a hard border."" Sky News political correspondent tweets... Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Conservative MPs have been arriving for a meeting with the
prime minister in Downing Street tonight. Former Conservative Party leader Iain Duncan Smith told
reporters that he had not yet seen Boris Johnsonâs proposals for a Brexit deal,
while Bernard Jenkin said there were âstill problems - I am going in now to
see if the problems still existâ. Others seen arriving â all members of the pro-Brexit ERG
group - were Steve Baker, Marcus Fyshe, Craig Mackinlay, John Redwood, Owen
Paterson and Bill Cash The prime ministerâs chief adviser Dominic Cummings was also
seen arriving in Downing Street but refused to speak to reporters. Chris MorrisBBC Reality Check Michel Barnier's reaction was cautious, to put it mildly. Two of the key words in his response: whatever replaces the backstop has to be ""legally operative"". In other words: not a broad plan which we can then sort out over the next couple of years. That is something the UK government has suggested - maybe we can use a transition period to iron out the details. The EU has said from the start: ""No, that's not what we agreed previously, it has to be a legally operative solution when you leave."" The chances of that happening between now and the end of October - even the middle of October at that EU summit - are just very, very slim. It's an incredibly tall order because these are technical issues, difficult issues, which take time to negotiate. Downing Street has released a statement confirming its intention to seek to prorogue Parliament on Tuesday 8 October with a Queenâs Speech on Monday 14 October. ""These
timings would mean Parliament is prorogued for the shortest time possible to
enable all the necessary logistical preparations for a State Opening to be
undertaken,"" the statement says. Downing
Street has confirmed that the prime minister this evening has spoken with
German Chancellor Angela Merkel, President of the European Commission
Jean-Claude Juncker and Irish Taoiseach Leo
Varadkar to discuss the plan which the UK government put forward
today for a new protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland. The Number 10 spokesman said the prime minister would hold further conversations with
counterparts in coming days. Leader of the SDLP Colum Eastwood has given his reaction to the prime minister's plan. ""This is no compromise proposal,"" he says, adding the government's offer was ""unacceptable to  business, border communities and a majority of MLAs [members of the legislative assembly]"". ""This is a proposal from a government that doesn't understand the complexities of this island, but more to the point they don't care,"" he says. ""The brass neck of the DUP should come as no surprise. ""They honestly think people are idiots."" Independent MP tweets... Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Nick Boles was a Conservative MP until he resigned the whip, accusing his party of refusing to ""compromise"" over Brexit. BBC News Channel âWe will continue to work to reach a
deal. No-deal will never be choice of EU - never,"" says Michel
Barnier, Chief EU Brexit negotiator. ""So we will continue to reach
a deal and work with the UK team, but a deal which respects the three commitments of the backstop in the legal operative manner and respecting the
mandate given to the Commission by the European Parliament.â He says the three objectives of the backstop are ""no border"", the ""all-Ireland economy"" and ""protecting the single market"". The latter, he says, means ""protecting the consumers, the citizens and the businesses inside the single market, the 27 member states"". Nick EardleyBBC political correspondent The Government intends to prorogue Parliament next Tuesday â
and holda Queenâs Speechon
Monday the 14th. In its
judgement earlier this month, the Supreme Court ruled the last attempt unlawful,
but left open the prospect of shorter prorogation. Ministers
have repeatedly said the current session of Parliament must end so that the
government can introduce a raft of new domestic legislation. To that end,
it intends to send MPs home on Tuesday â and hold the Queenâs Speech on the
original planned date â the
14th of October. Number 10 had been studying the implications of the Supreme Court judgement â
and will hope a shorter suspension of a few days rather than five weeks causes
it less trouble. It also avoids another
potentially awkward conversation with the Palace about rescheduling the Queenâs
plans. Already, however, opposition parties have raised concerns. A source
told the BBC Boris Johnson was trying to avoid prime ministerâs questions and
parliamentary scrutiny.  John CampbellBBC News NI Economics and Business Editor What was the backstop? How does Boris Johnson's plan differ on customs? And will the Irish government go for it? BBC News NI's economic and business editor, John Campbell,answers your questions. BBC News Channel Tony Blair's former chief of staff, Jonathan Powell, says the government's plan is ""not a serious negotiating position"". ""It is part of a political game to put the blame of failure on the EU,"" he says. ""If it was a serious proposal it wouldn't propose a hard border in Northern Ireland. ""There is no way this a serious proposition - those of us who thought they [the government] didn't want a deal are correct."" Chair of the Commons Brexit Committee Hilary Benn says Boris Johnson's plan would require customs checks on the island of Ireland. He says that is ""very hard"" to reconcile with the government's earlier committments. ""We know that any checks are going to create a difficulty given the delicacy of the peace process in Northern Ireland,"" he adds. Speaking in Belfast, DUP leader Arlene Foster says: ""We will be supporting this plan."" âIt allows us to leave the customs union, it allows us to
leave the single market, then we opt in if weâre not in the position to put in
place alternative arrangements at that time, so therefore we consent to
whatever is coming forward,"" she says. ""Thatâs a big difference and something that works
for Northern Ireland whilst letting us leave the European Unionâ. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,1.0

Emerging from a briefing with the EUâs chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier, he adds a written response will be produced tomorrow. Boris Johnson and his Irish counterpart Leo Varadkar have spoken over the phone this evening. Mr Varadkar, whose support is crucial for any hope of a wider UK-EU agreement, has issued a short statement in response. He suggested the UK's proposals ""do not fully meet the agreed objectives of the backstop"". In other words, they do not go far enough in upholding the integrity of the EU's single market and protecting the peace settlement in Northern Ireland. But he reiterated that he wanted an agreement and he would consult with the European Commission and other member states in the coming days. He said he expected to speak to Mr Johnson again early next week. Laura KuenssbergBBC political editor Seventy days into Boris Johnson's time in office we now know how he wants to change Theresa May's deal with the European Union. What we don't know, and he doesn't know, is whether his counterparts on the continent have the faintest intention of letting him do so. At the highest levels of government there is a belief that senior figures in the EU, even in Dublin, were certainly willing to contemplatea set of plans,externallike this.

Conservative MPs have been arriving for a meeting with the
prime minister in Downing Street tonight. Former Conservative Party leader Iain Duncan Smith told
reporters that he had not yet seen Boris Johnsonâs proposals for a Brexit deal,
while Bernard Jenkin said there were âstill problems - I am going in now to
see if the problems still existâ. Others seen arriving â all members of the pro-Brexit ERG
group - were Steve Baker, Marcus Fyshe, Craig Mackinlay, John Redwood, Owen
Paterson and Bill Cash The prime ministerâs chief adviser Dominic Cummings was also
seen arriving in Downing Street but refused to speak to reporters. Chris MorrisBBC Reality Check Michel Barnier's reaction was cautious, to put it mildly. Two of the key words in his response: whatever replaces the backstop has to be ""legally operative"". In other words: not a broad plan which we can then sort out over the next couple of years. That is something the UK government has suggested - maybe we can use a transition period to iron out the details. The EU has said from the start: ""No, that's not what we agreed previously, it has to be a legally operative solution when you leave."" The chances of that happening between now and the end of October - even the middle of October at that EU summit - are just very, very slim. It's an incredibly tall order because these are technical issues, difficult issues, which take time to negotiate. Downing Street has released a statement confirming its intention to seek to prorogue Parliament on Tuesday 8 October with a Queenâs Speech on Monday 14 October. ""These
timings would mean Parliament is prorogued for the shortest time possible to
enable all the necessary logistical preparations for a State Opening to be
undertaken,"" the statement says. Downing
Street has confirmed that the prime minister this evening has spoken with
German Chancellor Angela Merkel, President of the European Commission
Jean-Claude Juncker and Irish Taoiseach Leo
Varadkar to discuss the plan which the UK government put forward
today for a new protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland. The Number 10 spokesman said the prime minister would hold further conversations with
counterparts in coming days. Leader of the SDLP Colum Eastwood has given his reaction to the prime minister's plan. ""This is no compromise proposal,"" he says, adding the government's offer was ""unacceptable to  business, border communities and a majority of MLAs [members of the legislative assembly]"". ""This is a proposal from a government that doesn't understand the complexities of this island, but more to the point they don't care,"" he says. ""The brass neck of the DUP should come as no surprise. ""They honestly think people are idiots."" Independent MP tweets... Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Monday the 14th. In its
judgement earlier this month, the Supreme Court ruled the last attempt unlawful,

it intends to send MPs home on Tuesday â and hold the Queenâs Speech on the

it less trouble. It also avoids another

"Airbus' A380 was unfairly subsidised, WTO says The US has been given the go-ahead to impose tariffs on $7.5bn (Â£6.1bn) of goods it imports from the EU. It is the latest chapter in a 15-year battle between the US and the EU over illegal subsidies for planemakers Airbus and rival Boeing. The World Trade Organization (WTO) ruling will mean tariffs on EU goods ranging from aircraft to cheese, olives and jumpers from 18 October. Brussels has threatened to retaliate similarly against US goods. US trade officials said the tariffs would be set at a 10% rate on aircraft and 25% on agricultural and other items. They have publisheda list of all the items,externalthat will be subject to the additional tariffs, most of which will apply to imports from France, Germany, Spain and the UK. The US said it had the authority to increase the tariffs ""at any time"" or change the products affected. Meanwhile, the two sides are waiting for the WTO to decide on what tariffs the EU can impose against the US in retaliation for US state aid given to Boeing. That ruling is expected next year. The European Commission,which has proposed tariffs on $20bn (Â£15bn) of US goods, said it hopes to reach a settlement. ""But if the US decides to impose WTO authorised countermeasures, it will be pushing the EU into a situation where we will have no other option than do the same,"" the European Commission said. The US first filed the case in 2004, arguing that cheap European loans for Airbus amounted to illegal state subsidies. The WTO decided in favour of the US, which subsequently complained that the EU and certain member countries were not in compliance with the decision, prompting years of further wrangling. The US had sought to impose tariffs on about $11bn in goods. Though the WTO cut that figure to $7.5bn, Wednesday's decision still marks the largest penalty of its kind in the organisation's history. The WTO's dispute settlement body must formally adopt the ruling but is not expected to overturn the decision. US trade officials said the EU's settlement offer came years too late and did not resolve US concerns about ongoing subsidies. Imposing tariffs is intended to produce a better proposal, they added. ""For years, Europe has been providing massive subsidies to Airbus that have seriously injured the US aerospace industry and our workers. ""Finally, after 15 years of litigation, the WTO has confirmed that the United States is entitled to impose countermeasures in response to the EU's illegal subsidies,"" said US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer. He said the US expected to ""enter into negotiations with the European Union aimed at resolving this issue in a way that will benefit American workers."" But governments across the EU, including the UK, called for the dispute to be resolved without the new tax. ""Resorting to tariffs is not in the interests of the UK, EU or US,"" the UK said. ""We are working closely with the US, EU and European partners to support a negotiated settlement to the Airbus and Boeing disputes"". Bruno Le Maire, France's finance minister, said the country was ""ready to respond firmly with our European partners"". ""A friendly resolution to the Boeing/Airbus dispute is the best solution, and all the more so given that Europe could impose sanctions on the US next year,"" he said. Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel said: ""A decision has been made based on international law through which Airbus will be affected unfortunately and we will see how the Americans will react"". German Chancellor Angela Merkel says the EU will watch to see how the US reacts These tariffs are separate to US President Donald Trump's ongoing trade disputes with countries around the world. Those were sparked in March 2018 when his administration announced tariffs of 25% on steel and 10% on aluminium imported into the US. It prompted the EU to impose â¬2.8bn (Â£2.4bn) of duties on US goods such as bourbon whiskey, motorcycles and orange juice last June. Mr Trump is also considering raising import duties on European cars. While the Boeing-Airbus fight pre-dates Mr Trump, another wave of tariffs adds to concerns about global trade, which has slowed significantly amid the many disputes. On Wednesday, Airbus chief executive Guillaume Faury warned that hitting aircraft with the import duties would disrupt the industry, raise costs and hurt the broader economy - including in the US. Airbus chief executive Guillaume Faury warned the tariffs could impact US jobs Close to 40% of Airbus's aircraft-related procurement comes from US aerospace suppliers, which it said it supports 275,000 American jobs in 40 states. ""Airbus is therefore hopeful that the US and the EU will agree to find a negotiated solution before creating serious damage to the aviation industry as well as to trade relations and the global economy,"" Mr Faury said. BBC economics correspondent Andrew Walker said tensions in global trade had already risen since President Trump took office. ""It's worth remembering that the International Monetary Fund and others see trade conflict as one of the biggest risks to the global economic outlook,"" he added.

Liverpool said they ""accept the judgement, outcome and punishment"", which they described as ""proportionate with the technical indiscretion committed"". Midfielder Chirivella needed the paperwork from the Football Association after a loan spell at Spanish side Extremadura last season. The EFL said Liverpool had ""sought the assistance of the Football Association"" before the season, and had been allowed to include Chirivella on the team sheet for Premier League Two games, the under-23 competition. An EFL statement read: ""The club's breach was in part due to the challenges it encountered with securing the correct international clearance, and its subsequent ability to include the player on team sheets despite the lack of clearance. ""As a result the board concluded the most appropriate sanction was a financial penalty."" Liverpool said: ""Even though there were mitigating factors, which were beyond our control or jurisdiction, we believe it appropriate we apologise to the competition's governing body and also to Milton Keynes Dons."" Liverpool must pay the of Â£100,000, plus an additional sanction, if they were to field another ineligible player in the competition before the end of next season. In 2014, Sunderland were fined by the Premier League and the EFL after they fielded ineligible player Ji Dong-won in four league matches and a League Cup game.

"This video can not be played ""We are tabling constructive and reasonable proposals... the alternative is no deal"" Mr Johnson said Boris Johnson says there should be ""no doubt"" the only alternative to the Brexit proposals he will put to Brussels later is no-deal. Addressing his party conference in Manchester, the PM said his plan would be a ""compromise by the UK"", but he hoped the EU would ""understand that and compromise in their turn"". The European Commission said they will ""examine [the proposals] objectively"". The Irish PM said he had not seen the plans but was ""not encouraged"". Leo Varadker told the Irish Parliament: ""What we are hearing is not encouraging and would not be the basis for agreement."" The UK is set to leave the EU on 31 October. The government has insisted it will not negotiate a further delay beyond the Halloween deadline, saying this would be unnecessary and costly for the UK. However, under the terms of a law passed by Parliament last month, the PM faces having to request another extension unless MPs back the terms of withdrawal by 19 October - two days after a summit of European leaders. The European Commission's President Jean-Claude Juncker and Mr Johnson will speak on the phone later, and the two sides' negotiating teams will also meet. LIVE: PMQs and Johnson's speech to conference PM: UK offering 'constructive' Brexit plans Would a Brexit delay cost the UK Â£400m a week? UK Brexit plans to include Irish customs checks In his speech, Mr Johnson said no-deal was not an outcome the government was seeking, but ""it is an outcome for which we are ready"". On the eve of his speech, Mr Johnson told a conference fringe meeting, hosted by the DUP, that he hoped to reach a deal with the EU over the course of ""the next few days"". This video can not be played PM: Boris Johnson: ""It (no deal) is not an outcome we want... but is an outcome for which we are ready"" The issue of the Irish border - and how to keep it free from border checks when it becomes the frontier between the UK and the EU - has been a key sticking point in Brexit negotiations. Mr Johnson has said the solution reached by the EU and Theresa May, the backstop, is ""anti-democratic"" and ""inconsistent with the sovereignty of the UK"", claiming it offered no means for the UK to unilaterally exit and no say for the people of Northern Ireland over the rules that would apply there. The PM used his speech to confirm parts of his offer to the EU. He said that ""under no circumstances"" would there be checks at or near the border in Northern Ireland and the proposals would respect the peace process and theGood Friday agreement. It included promising ""a process of renewable democratic consent"" for the Stormont Assembly on its relationship with the EU going forward. He also referred to the use of technological solutions to ensure there was no hard border on the island of Ireland. He said he did not want a deal to be out of reach ""because of what is essentially a technical discussion of the exact nature of future customs checks when that technology is improving the whole time"". What are the Brexit backstop options? Are speculators pushing the PM towards no deal? Mr Johnson also said he would ""protect the existing regulatory arrangements for farmers and other businesses on both sides of the border"". He added: ""At the same time we will allow the UK - whole and entire - to withdraw from the EU, with control of our own trade policy from the start."" The PM said this would ""protect the union"". Echoing the main slogan of the conference, Mr Johnson said: ""Let's get Brexit done on 31 Octoberâ¦to answer the cry of those 17.4 million who voted for Brexit [and] for those millions who may have voted Remain, but are first and foremost democrats and accept the result of the referendum."" He said the Tories were ""not an anti-European party"" and the UK is ""not an anti-European country"". The PM added: ""We love Europe. We are European. ""But after 45 years of really dramatic constitutional change, we must have a new relationship with the EU."" This speech was hugely important for Boris Johnson's Brexit deal. Be in no doubt that amongst those listening most closely, most intently, will be leaders in other European capitals, trying to gauge whether Mr Johnson is serious about a Brexit deal or whether he is paving the way for no-deal and looking to blame the EU. This was actually a rather surprising speech because there was none of the aggressive, combative language that we had been expecting - none of the in your face, take it or leave it final offer that we were told would form the guts of his argument. Instead, it seemed Mr Johnson went out of his way to adopt a rather more emollient approach, saying how much he loved Europe, how the Tory Party wasn't an anti-European party and how Britain wasn't an anti-European country. What that meant was that Mr Johnson didn't endeavour to bring the house down in the conference hall. He didn't go for the easy Brussels bashing, and for the wider viewers in this country, there were no brand new policy announcements. You sense Mr Johnson has calculated for the next few hours and days that the really crucial audience in terms of his premiership, and for his future, is not here in Manchester - it's in capitals around the EU. Before Mr Johnson's speech, a European Commission spokeswoman said they would examine the proposals objectively, adding: ""We will listen carefully to the UK."" She said the EU wanted to agree a deal with the UK, saying ""an orderly withdrawal is far more preferable than a 'no-deal' scenario"". But the spokeswoman also reminded the UK of its ""well-known criteria"",  saying: ""In order for there to be a deal, we must have a legally operational solution that meets all the objectives of the backstop. ""[That means] preventing a hard border, preserving North-South cooperation and the all-island economy, and protecting the EU's Single Market and Ireland's place in it."" Leo Varadker said he would work until the last moment to secure an agreement, but he added: ""We will not do so at any cost, and we are ready for no-deal if that's what the British decide to do."" The BBC's Europe editor, Katya Adler said the bloc wanted to do a deal and needed to be seen to try. But she added it was ""fundamentally misunderstanding the EU"" if the prime minister believed the other 26 EU leaders will turn round to Ireland and say they have to accept the proposals just they want to have a deal. There were huge rounds of applause for Mr Johnson from within the conference hall, showing support from his party. After the speech, one member said the PM was ""exactly what we need"", while another said she had been ""inspired"", adding: ""We are so fed up with nothing happening, but we feel like something will happen now because we think he will deliver."" Leaving the hall, Tory MP Mims Davies described her leader as ""bombastic Boris"", saying: ""That [speech] was a message to the country, a message to our party and a message to the EU - we are ready to get on with this."" But the PM's plan has been branded as ""extreme"" and ""doomed to failure"" by the SNP's Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, who said his strategy was leading towards a no-deal. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said the prime minister's speech was ""absolute bluster"" and he described it as a ""cynical manipulation to get a no-deal"". Mr McDonnell also that any Brexit deal or no-deal should be put to the people to make the final decision. The director general of the CBI, Dame Carolyn Fairbairn, praised the PM's ""optimistic vision for the UK"". But she said his plan ""relies on a good Brexit deal"". ""The UK is at a crossroads,"" she said. ""[And] the no-deal turning ends in a very different place: a swamp that will slow the UK's every step for years to come."" This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""If Parliament were a reality TV show... the whole lot of us would've been voted out of the jungle"" The PM also used the opportunity to criticise Parliament, saying it ""refuses to deliver Brexit, refuses to do anything constructive and refuses to have an election"". He said: ""I am afraid that after three and a half years people are beginning to feel that they are being taken for fools."" Mr Johnson said the Tories were ""the party of the NHS"" because of their belief in capitalism, adding: ""We understand the vital symmetry at the heart of the modern British economy between a dynamic enterprise culture and great public services precisely because we are the party of capitalism."" He praised London as its former mayor, but pledged to ""unlock talent in every corner of the UK"", and ensure safety with his existing policies of 20,000 additional police officers and tackling county lines gangs. And he repeated more policy announcements from the conference on infrastructure, education, law and order. Mr Johnson concluded: ""Let's get on with sensible moderate one nation but tax-cutting Tory government and, figuratively if not literally, let us send Jeremy Corbyn into orbit where he belongs. ""Let's get Brexit done [and] let's bring our country together."" Mr Johnson's conference speech clashed with Prime Minister's Questions. Normally the Commons goes into recess for the Tory conference, but MPs voted against this amid the bitter fallout from the government's unlawful prorogation of Parliament. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab deputised for the prime minister, facing theshadow home secretary Diane Abbott over the despatch box. He told MPs the government will present its written Brexit proposals to them later. Do you have any questions about Brexit?

"Jodie Chesney was stabbed in the back while sitting with friends in a park A man accused of murdering a 17-year-old girl told a friend he had ""done something real bad"", a court has heard.

"How does the prime minister's Irish border plan differ from the backstop? BBC News NI's economic and business editor John Campbell has a look. It was the plan for keeping the Irish border as open as it is today, if that can't be achieved through a trade deal or technological solutions. It was agreed by the former Prime Minister Theresa May in November 2018. It would mean the whole of the UK staying in a customs union with the EU. Northern Ireland alone would stay in EU's single market for goods. This arrangement would remain until both sides agreed there was something better to replace it. Prime Minister Boris Johnson opposes the backstop saying it is antidemocratic and could trap the UK in the EU's customs territory This video can not be played PM: Boris Johnson: ""It (no deal) is not an outcome we want... but is an outcome for which we are ready"" It says the whole of the UK should leave the EU's customs union. This inevitably means a new customs border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland with new requirements for cross-border traders. However the prime minister believes the impact of this can be minimised with any checks taking place away from the border. His plan involves trusted trader schemes and simplified customs procedures with the smallest traders being exempt from all customs procedures. He suggests that physical checks would only be required on a small proportion of trade and that most checks could take place at traders' premises. However the plan suggests that checks may also have to happen at ""other designated locations which could be located anywhere in Ireland or Northern Ireland."" Are those 'designated locations' customs posts by another name? The plan would also probably require the EU to make changes or derogations to its customs rules. Mr Johnson has written to the European Commission president about his proposals Mr Johnson's plan has big similarities to the backstop. Northern Ireland would continue to follow EU rules on agriculture, food safety and industrial goods -the rest of the UK would not. That would effectively mean a new border in the Irish Sea with checks on goods coming in here from other parts of the UK. These sorts of checks already happen on livestock. All animals coming here from the rest of UK enter through an inspection post at Larne Harbour. The new plan would mean an increase in the scope and scale of these checks. The DUP has welcomed the new border plan One big difference in the new plan is that the Northern Ireland Executive and Assembly would have to approve that single market arrangement coming into force. Then every four years, Stormont would have to decide if it wants to continue to follow EU rules or align with the rest of the UK. The DUP, which has welcomed the plan, believes that would mean Northern Ireland would always default to UK regulations unless there is a cross-community vote at Stormont to continue to follow EU regulations. Nationalist parties fear this would amount to a unionist veto on whether to continue to follow EU rules. That is because of the existence of a veto mechanism at Stormont known as the Petition of Concern. The Irish government agreed on an interim Brexit deal with the UK in 2017 It seems unlikely at this stage. From the Irish government's point of view, they made an agreement with the UK in the 2017 Joint Report - a kind of interim deal - which said there would not be ""any physical infrastructure or related checks and controls"" as a result of Brexit. That was not just an agreement to prevent any new infrastructure at the Irish border, it was any new checks on the island of Ireland. So the Irish government's position has been that the UK agreed that the status quo would be maintained for cross-border trade. What Boris Johnson is proposing on customs would not meet those criteria.

"Dame Moya Greene, Dame Minouche Shafik and Emma Walmsley are backing the campaign A group of 100 of the UK's most successful businesswomen have launched a campaign to close the gender pay gap. Some of corporate Britain's biggest names are behind the #MeTooPay initiative including Dame Minouche Shafik, potentially the Bank of England's next governor, and GSK boss Emma Walmsley. It was sparked following a gender bias case involving BNP Paribas bank. The campaign is spearheaded by former Royal Mail chief Dame Moya Greene. What is the pay gap where I work? Gender pay gap grows at hundreds of big firms Gender pay: Fewer than half of UK firms narrow gap ""Pay discrimination is more widespread than we had thought, even though we have had laws on the books for 40 years,"" she told the BBC. ""We want to keep this issue alive. ""Most companies have very good policies, but in many cases they are not properly enacted, nor are they always leading to good outcomes."" #MeTooPay has launched a website and social media campaign,externalto keep the gender pay gap in the spotlight. The group was shocked by the experiences of BNP Paribas bank employee Stacey Macken, who worked in the firm's prime brokerage division. An employment tribunal revealed her basic salary was 25% less than that of her male colleague, and her first-year bonus payment was less than half of his. That was despite equal grades for their workplace performance. Dame Moya, pictured here with the Duchess of Cambridge, spent eight years at the helm of Royal Mail Three years after joining, the difference between Ms Macken's bonus and that of her male peer had widened to 85%. Ms Macken won her claim for sexual discrimination against the investment bank. ""It is part of a series of high-profile discriminatory cases we have seen over the past 12 to 18 months,"" said Dame Moya, Royal Mail boss from 2010 to 2018, and currently a non-executive director at airline Easyjet. ""Pay discrimination is fundamentally a management issue, they decide who is going to be paid what,"" she adds. However, she said that in the majority of instances discrimination was not deliberate, but a case of ""unconscious bias"". The campaign website will include the latest instances of pay discrimination, record details of important court cases and provide a place ""to share good and bad policies in action"". It will ask for input from workplace professionals, including compensation experts who can help accurately assess gender pay differences, and negotiation experts who can help women achieve better salary deals. Dame Moya says she tried to increase the number of women at Royal Mail Dame Moya hit the headlines last year when her successor at Royal Mail, Rico Back, was paid  Â£100,000 - or 17% - more in base salary than she received. The delivery firm said the discrepancy was to compensate for lower contributions to his pension scheme. ""I thought that was fair,"" she said. ""I received a pension reward that was appropriate for the time."" Commenting on what she did at Royal Mail to improve diversity, she said: ""Logistics is and was a male-dominated industry. I think at Royal Mail we were able to increase the number of women in all roles.  We also helped raise awareness that logistics had a long way to go."" Other high profile backers of the campaign include broadcaster Clare Balding, Land Securities' chairwoman Dame Alison Carnwath, Dame Jayne-Anne Gadhia, who was chief executive of Virgin Money from 2007 to 2018, and Baroness Dido Harding, chairman of NHS Improvement and former chief executive of TalkTalk. The campaign is hoping to plug into the wider #MeToo movement Some might question the wisdom of harnessing the name of the pay campaign to the original and more famous anti-sexual abuse #MeToo movement. ""What we thought was that in the UK today, there is so much of importance going on that it is so hard to get 'cut through',"" says Dame Moya. ""This campaign allows us to morph from the sexual harassment aspects of discrimination and move it into another area."" Gender pay gap: What is the pay gap at your company?

"The RSC, based in Stratford-upon-Avon, said the decision had ""not been taken lightly"" The Royal Shakespeare Company is to end its partnership with BP at the end of the year following criticism of its links to the international oil giant. The RSC said it ""could not ignore"" the ""strength of feeling"" against the deal. Last week, school studentsthreatened to boycottthe theatre company if it did not sever links with the firm. ""Young people are now saying clearly to us that the BP sponsorship is putting a barrier between them and their wish to engage with the RSC,"" it said. BP has subsidised the Stratford-upon-Avon-based theatre company's Â£5 ticket scheme for 16 to 25-year-olds. Gregory Doran and Catherine Mallyon, the theatre company's artistic and executive directors, said the ""difficult"" decision had not been taken ""lightly or swiftly"". ""We would like to thank BP for their generous support of the RSC since 2011,"" they said. Sir Mark Rylance resigned as an RSC associate artist earlier this year In a statement, BP said it was ""disappointed and dismayed"" its partnership had been brought to a ""premature"" end. ""Over the past eight years our sponsorship has enabled 80,000 young people to see RSC performances at reduced rates,"" it continued. The company said it shared ""many of the concerns that apparently contributed to the decision"" and was committed to making energy ""cleaner and better"". ""The increasing polarisation of debate, and attempts to exclude companies committed to making real progress, is exactly what is not needed,"" it continued. Paapa Essiedu and Ewart James Walters starred in the RSC's Hamlet in 2016 Last week, a group of students said they would boycott RSC productions if it continued to accept funding from a company they accused of ""actively destroying our futures"". ""BP's influence is nothing but a stain on the RSC,"" they wrote in a letter. Earlier this year, Sir Mark Rylance, a long-standing critic of the sponsorship agreement,resigned from his postas an RSC associate artist. In his resignation letter, the Oscar-winning actor said he did not ""wish to be associated with BP any more than I would with an arms dealer [or] tobacco salesman"". Greenpeace UK said it was ""time other oil-sponsored institutions took note"". Morten Thaysen, climate campaigner at Greenpeace, said: ""Grassroots campaigns like BP Or Not BP and the youth strikers deserve this win... It's hard not to think the walls are closing in on BP."" BP spends Â£7.5 million per year on arts and culture sponsorship, which includes deals with the British Museum, the Royal Opera House and the National Portrait Gallery. It cut its sponsorship of theTate art galleries in 2016, but said the decision was not a result of protests by climate activists. Follow us onFacebook,external, or on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external.

"This video can not be played PM: Boris Johnson: ""It (no deal) is not an outcome we want... but is an outcome for which we are ready"" The government's final Brexit proposals will include customs checks on the island of Ireland. The BBC's Laura Kuenssberg said Boris Johnson's plans will see Northern Ireland ""in a different relationship with the EU to the rest of the UK"". Boris Johnson is addressing the Tory conference before submitting the new proposals to the EU. The European Commission said they will ""examine it objectively"" and ""listen carefully to the UK"". The Commission's president, Jean-Claude Juncker will talk to the PM on the phone later, while negotiating teams will meet in Brussels. In his first speech at the event as prime minister, he will call it a ""fair and reasonable"" Brexit compromise, and say only by leaving the EU on 31 October can the UK ""move on"". Mr Johnson will also claim the public will no longer be ""taken for fools"" by those who want to delay or block the process. Tory Chairman James Cleverly said the UK had been ""flexible and pragmatic"", and now the EU must be the same. On the eve of his speech, Mr Johnson told a conference fringe meeting in Manchester, hosted by the DUP, that he hoped to reach a deal with the EU over the course of ""the next few days"". The government has insisted it will not negotiate a further delay beyond the Halloween deadline, saying this would be unnecessary and costly for the UK. What are the Brexit backstop options? PM: UK offering 'constructive' Brexit plans Would a Brexit delay cost the UK Â£400m a week? However, under the terms of a law passed by Parliament last month, the PM faces having to request another extension unless MPs back the terms of withdrawal by 19 October - two days after a summit of European leaders. On Tuesday, Mr Johnson dismissed leaked reports that customs posts could be set up on either side of the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. He said suggestions the UK wanted ""clearance zones"" for goods as part of a package of alternative arrangements to replace the Irish backstop were wide of the mark. While he conceded some customs checks would be needed as the UK leaves the EU's customs union and single market, he said technology could keep them to an ""absolute minimum"". The issue of the Irish border - and how to keep it free from border checks when it becomes the frontier between the UK and the EU - has been a key sticking point in Brexit negotiations. Mr Johnson says the solution reached by the EU and Theresa May, the backstop, is ""anti-democratic"" and ""inconsistent with the sovereignty of the UK"", claiming it offered no means for the UK to unilaterally exit and no say for the people of Northern Ireland over the rules that would apply there. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the new offer from Mr Johnson included some new customs checks on the island of Ireland, and would leave Northern Ireland in a different relationship with the EU to the rest of the UK in some ways. She said the plans were ""based on the notion of consent"", giving more powers to Northern Ireland's devolved Parliament - the Stormont Assembly - to shape its future relationship with the EU - despite the fact the assembly is approaching 1,000 days without sitting. The proposals also suggest a time period for when the relationship between Northern Ireland and the EU could move on. But the full and precise details of Mr Johnson's plan twill not be clear until after the prime minister's speech at conference. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme earlier, Mr Cleverly appeared to put the ball in the EU's court. ""We have been in negotiating for some while,"" he said. ""The UK has been flexible, but a negotiation means both parties need to be flexible. ""What we need to see now is the EU be flexible - and if they can be pragmatic and flexible, we can leave with a deal on 31 October. But we are going to leave on 31 October whatever."" Irish Fine Gael senator Neale Richmond told Today that the PM's plans were a ""big move"" from the withdrawal agreement made by Theresa May. Mr Richmond said, under the plan, Northern Ireland would leave the customs union and ""come out of the single market in all areas, apart from agri-food products and industrial products, and indeed it only stays in those areas for four years"". This, he added, would require ""additional checks"" on the island of Ireland - something he described as ""extremely disappointing"". Laura Kuenssberg said there was a ""real expectation and belief"" in No 10 that ""this is now the crunch point"". She said: ""This is the momentâ¦where the EU will have to respond and say [either] there is something that is a basis of a deal here, or not. ""And what Boris Johnson is trying to suggest is if the answer is not, then for him, that means no-deal."" The EU needs to see the precise details of Boris Johnson's proposals, but the direction of travel that has been coming through is different. The very idea of customs check between Ireland and Northern Ireland, the promise of the use of technologies to ease the process that haven't yet been tried and tested, or don't even exist yetâ¦that is a big no-no for the EU. The bloc will look at the proposals carefully. They need to try as they do want a deal, and also they need to be seen to be trying. But it is fundamentally misunderstanding the EU if the prime minister thinks at this stage the 26 EU leaders will turn round on the Irish prime minister and say: ""Listen, you are going to have to accept this because we just want to have a deal."" It is also fundamentally misunderstanding the German Chancellor Angela Merkel, her attachment to EU unity and the integrity of the single market. And also it is misunderstanding that the EU sees this in a bigger picture. If suddenly now they were to back down to all of the prime minister's demands how would that look to other trade partners across the globe. So EU leaders will be very careful not to rubbish the prime minister's ideas, to talk about them as a basis for an agreement, but if it is take it or leave it, they will be leaving at this point. BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith said it was particularly important Mr Johnson secured the support of the Democratic Unionist Party's 10 MPs. He said: ""I think it is very clear this deal is not going to fly unless Boris Johnson can bring the DUP along with him... one way or another he has to make sure they're on board."" BBC Northern Ireland political editor Mark Devenport said sources fromthe DUP were supportive of the proposalsand had been kept informed during their development. However, the party's leader, Arlene Foster, declined to say whether she had seen the PM's proposals. She told the BBC: ""What we are doing with this prime minister is working very closely with him and we will continue to work closely with him over the next couple of hours and days. ""I hope we do get a deal that is acceptable to the European Union and one that is good for the whole of the United Kingdom."" This video can not be played PM: Irish customs checks after Brexit can be ""absolutely minimal"" Speaking in Manchester, Mr Johnson will suggest voters are ""desperate"" for the country to focus on other priorities and will contrast his determination to leave on 31 October with the ""years of uncertainty"" that he says would result from a Labour government promising another referendum. ""What people want, what Leavers want, what Remainers want, what the whole world wants - is to move on,"" he is expected to say. ""I am afraid that after three-and-a-half years people are beginning to feel that they are being taken for fools. ""They are beginning to suspect that there are forces in this country that simply don't want Brexit delivered at all. ""And if they turn out to be right in that suspicion then I believe there will be grave consequences for trust in democracy. ""Let's get Brexit done on October 31 so in 2020 our country can move on.""

"Boris Johnson hasoutlined his plan to the European Union (EU),externalto avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland after Brexit. Mr Johnson said the plan ""removes the so-called backstop"". The backstop is the insurance policy negotiated by Theresa May and the EU. It is designed to avoid any physical border infrastructure, which it is feared would bring back memories of the Troubles, after Brexit. It would keep the UK in the same customs territory as the EU, and Northern Ireland closely tied to EU regulations - until the UK and the EU reach a trade deal. But it would stop the UK striking its own trade deals, which is why so many Conservative MPs, including Mr Johnson, oppose the backstop. So, what is his alternative? The government wants the UK to leave the EU customs union. This would mean Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland ending up in two different customs territories. This means lorries entering the Republic of Ireland from Northern Ireland will need to complete customs declarations. This is to ensure the correct tariffs (tax on imports) are paid when UK goods enter the EU customs union. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. Reality Check's Chris Morris:From the beginning the EU has struggled to see how Ireland and Northern Ireland can exist in different customs territories while keeping the border as open as it is now under all circumstances. They will argue that - in the absence of a future free trade deal - this proposal means the UK is breaking commitments it has made about the border. The UK counters that the backstop has already been rejected in Parliament three times, and something needs to change. Instead of installing customs posts and other physical infrastructure at the Irish border, the UK says declarations should be done electronically. The government says physical checks would still be needed ""on a very small proportion of movements"". Currently, about one in 100 consignments entering the EU customs union are inspected to check that the goods match the information on the declaration. These inspections could be carried out at warehouses or ""designated locations, which could be located anywhere in Ireland or Northern Ireland."" The government's proposal does not spell out what these ""designated locations"" would look like, but it adds there should be ""a firm commitment (by both parties) never to conduct checks at the border in future"". Why is the Irish border blocking Brexit? If adopted, a border solution relying on technology and remote checks would be a first. The EU does not currently share a single border with a non-EU country where checks have been completely eliminated. That includes Norway (not in the EU) and Sweden (an EU member) - which share one of the most technologically advanced borders in the world. Their main crossing point processes about 1,300 lorries a day, with each waiting 20 minutes on average. The EU has previously rejected a customs solution that relies on technology. Back in January, Sabine Weyand, the EU's director-general for trade, said: ""We looked at every border on this Earth, every border the EU has with a third country - there's simply no way you can do away with checks and controls."" The government says that some small traders should be exempt from paying duty. However, the document does not address smuggling head on. In other words, what will be done to detect and prevent traders, who should be paying duty, from crossing the border without completing custom declarations first? Reality Check's Chris Morris:The EU will see much of this as a rehash of previous ideas that it doesn't think will work. And many people will worry that unspecified ""designated locations"" could become targets for anyone seeking to undermine the Northern Ireland peace process. The EU will push back hard against suggestions that it needs to revise its own customs rules to suit the UK. When it comes to the regulation of goods, Northern Ireland would keep to the rules of the EU's single market, rather than UK rules. That removes the need for product standard and safety checks on goods at the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland, because both will be part of an ""all-island regulatory zone"". But it creates the need for checks between the rest of the UK - which will not be sticking to EU single market rules - and Northern Ireland.. All agricultural, food or animal products entering Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK will have to go through a Border Inspection Post. That's a bit of infrastructure where goods can be physically examined and paperwork checked. Manufactured goods in Northern Ireland would also have to keep to EU rules, and these goods would be checked ""at the boundary of the zone"" - presumably at crossings between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, on the Irish Sea. Reality Check's Chris Morris:This is quite a big concession from the UK side - basically accepting that there would have to be quite intrusive checks between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK for a number of years, on things like product standards and food safety. The EU has always said there have to be checks carried out somewhere, and both sides will try to deny any suggestion that this amounts to a new border in the Irish Sea. Having Northern Ireland following EU rules for the production of goods over which it has no say is, as the document says, ""a significant democratic problem"". As a result, it is proposed that the Northern Ireland Assembly and Executive will have to sign off on the plan before it takes effect. The Northern Irish institutions will be asked to approve the plan again every four years, and if they do not then Northern Ireland would stop following EU rules one year later. The Northern Ireland Assembly has not met since early 2017. Reality Check's Chris Morris:The issue of democratic legitimacy is a crucial one, but it cannot be applied unevenly. The EU is likely to have a problem with anything which suggests that only Northern Ireland could have - in effect - a veto on this plan. The point of the backstop was to provide a legal guarantee to keep an open border under all circumstances. Being subject to approval every four years simply isn't the same thing. If Northern Ireland voted to leave this arrangement things like checks on food safety would have to take place at the Irish border. What claims do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

"A key part of the Brexit negotiations has been the border that separates Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The border is a matter of great political, security and diplomatic sensitivity in Ireland. Therefore the UK and EU agreed that whatever happens as a result of Brexit there should be no new physical checks or infrastructure at the frontier. This is where the controversial ""backstop"" comes in. At present, goods and services are traded between the two jurisdictions with few restrictions. That is because the UK and Ireland are part of the EU's single market and customs union, so products do not need to be inspected for customs or standards. But after Brexit, all that could change - the two parts of Ireland could be in different customs and regulatory regimes, which could mean products being checked at the border. The preference of both sides is to prevent this happening through a deep and comprehensive trade deal. However, the UK's ambition to leave the customs union and the single market, could make that very difficult. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. And if both sides couldn't reach agreement on a deal keeping the border as open as it is now - that's where the backstop would come in. So how might it it work? There are several options: This is what the EU originally proposed. It would involve Northern Ireland alone remaining in the EU's single market and customs union, leaving Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) free to strike trade deals. But the DUP - a Northern Ireland unionist party that propped up Theresa May's minority Conservative government - objected to this. It said it would see Northern Ireland treated differently and could threaten the union. Boris Johnson has alsospecifically ruled this out. After the DUP's objections, Mrs May agreed a backstop involving the whole of the UK retaining a very close relationship with the EU - staying in the customs union - for an indefinite period. It would also see Northern Ireland staying even more closely tied to some rules of the EU single market. These arrangements would apply unless and until both the EU and UK agree they are no longer necessary. This video can not be played Would you notice if you crossed the Irish border? (Video from 2017) The backstop would not apply if the UK left the EU without a deal but the potential problems with the border would remain. The backstop plan was agreed by UK-EU negotiators and formed part of Theresa May's withdrawal agreement in November 2018 (often referred to as the Brexit ""divorce deal""). It sparked a backlash from many Conservative MPs (and the DUP) at Westminster and several of her own ministers resigned in protest. Please upgrade your browser They feared that the backstop would be used to permanently trap the UK in the EU customs union, preventing the country from striking its own trade deals. Ultimately, her deal was voted down three times, leading to her resignation. Prime Minister Boris Johnson says he is committed to ""getting rid"" of the backstop, describing it as ""anti-democratic"". His government has instead proposed the idea of a ""single regulatory zone"" on the island of Ireland. That would mean Northern Ireland continuing to follow EU rules on animal health, food safety and manufactured goods. It would effectively mean a new regulatory border in the Irish Sea with checks and controls at ports. The DUP say they can accept this as long as there is a role for the Northern Ireland Assembly to give ongoing consent to these arrangements. On customs, the UK has said Northern Ireland must leave the EU customs union. However the Prime Minister believes checks at the Irish frontier can be avoided by instead having customs processes mainly at company premises. The EU is sceptical about this and the latest negotiations have focused largely on customs. Many Brexit supporters say what are known as ""alternative arrangements"" could be used to avoid checks at the border. The phrase is normally used to refer to technical or technological solutions. These include things like trusted traders schemes and using GPS to track lorries. The EU has committed to working on alternative arrangements but has said no systems which could solve the border problem are currently ""operational"".

"The RSC, based in Stratford-upon-Avon, said the decision had ""not been taken lightly"" The Royal Shakespeare Company is to end its partnership with BP at the end of the year following criticism of its links to the international oil giant. The RSC said it ""could not ignore"" the ""strength of feeling"" against the deal. Last week, school studentsthreatened to boycottthe theatre company if it did not sever links with the firm. ""Young people are now saying clearly to us that the BP sponsorship is putting a barrier between them and their wish to engage with the RSC,"" it said. BP has subsidised the Stratford-upon-Avon-based theatre company's Â£5 ticket scheme for 16 to 25-year-olds. Gregory Doran and Catherine Mallyon, the theatre company's artistic and executive directors, said the ""difficult"" decision had not been taken ""lightly or swiftly"". ""We would like to thank BP for their generous support of the RSC since 2011,"" they said. Sir Mark Rylance resigned as an RSC associate artist earlier this year In a statement, BP said it was ""disappointed and dismayed"" its partnership had been brought to a ""premature"" end. ""Over the past eight years our sponsorship has enabled 80,000 young people to see RSC performances at reduced rates,"" it continued. The company said it shared ""many of the concerns that apparently contributed to the decision"" and was committed to making energy ""cleaner and better"". ""The increasing polarisation of debate, and attempts to exclude companies committed to making real progress, is exactly what is not needed,"" it continued. Paapa Essiedu and Ewart James Walters starred in the RSC's Hamlet in 2016 Last week, a group of students said they would boycott RSC productions if it continued to accept funding from a company they accused of ""actively destroying our futures"". ""BP's influence is nothing but a stain on the RSC,"" they wrote in a letter. Earlier this year, Sir Mark Rylance, a long-standing critic of the sponsorship agreement,resigned from his postas an RSC associate artist. In his resignation letter, the Oscar-winning actor said he did not ""wish to be associated with BP any more than I would with an arms dealer [or] tobacco salesman"". Greenpeace UK said it was ""time other oil-sponsored institutions took note"". Morten Thaysen, climate campaigner at Greenpeace, said: ""Grassroots campaigns like BP Or Not BP and the youth strikers deserve this win... It's hard not to think the walls are closing in on BP."" BP spends Â£7.5 million per year on arts and culture sponsorship, which includes deals with the British Museum, the Royal Opera House and the National Portrait Gallery.

"This video can not be played Residents were trapped in their homes in the village of Laxey on the Isle of Man A clean-up operation is under way on the Isle of Man after severe flooding left people trapped in their homes. The village ofLaxey was cut off when the river burst its bankson Tuesday leaving several homes under 6ft (1.8m) of water. One resident said the flooding was ""an unmitigated disaster that could have been prevented"". Chief Minister Howard Quayle said an action plan was being drawn up to ""ensure it doesn't happen again"". Infrastructure minister Ray Harmer said the ""massive clear-up"" would continue in the village ""for the next day or so"". A major part of the works was removing trees and debris from the river to prevent more flooding in the immediate future. Many homes in Glen Road have been affected Extra sandbags were also delivered and skips provided for residents to dispose of flood-damaged flooring and furniture, he added. Although it was too early to say what long-term measures would be put in place, the government was taking ""a number of actions"", added Mr Harmer. Home affairs chief executive Dan Davies said debris was being removed from the river and roads and help was being offered to residents. ""It is really about supporting people to get back in their homes,"" he said. ""If they are vulnerable, health and social care will be on the scene helping people out."" The gap in the wall is being shored-up to prevent further flooding in the coming days Charlotte Morgan-Jones and her family were stranded in their home for several hours. The mother-of-two said the moment water surged through the village was ""scary"". ""It was literally like something you see in movies,"" she said. ""My husband was outside putting out sandbags, the next thing all I heard was shouting and screaming and the water was coming in the front door."" The clear-up is set to continue for some time John Wood said staff ""had to work hard"" to clear the flood water at Laxey Woollen Mills Debbie Corlett said the situation was ""surreal"" for residents At Laxey Woollen Mills, staff ""had to work hard to get it all cleared"", said master weaver John Wood. ""The flooring will need seeing to in a couple of weeks when it's all dried out a bit,"" he said. ""I'm sure there's going to be quite a lot of work, but it's nothing compared to what other people have."" Resident Debbie Corlett recalled the moment a second breach in the river wall was made to release the flood water back into the river, She said it was ""like a plug being pulled"". ""I could hear a big cheer up the road. It abated very, very quickly because it could get back into the river, which is where should have been in the first place,"" she said. ""It was all very surreal."" Mark and Tracey Young are back in their home in Laxey assessing the damage caused by the flood. ""It started raining earlyâ¦ [there was] a little bit of rain and then the wall just collapsed and it was like a tidal wave,"" said Mr Young. Mark Young (right) said the water was like a ""tidal wave"" Richard Kneen said he was ""lucky"" but added others had been ""devastated"" Some residents reacted angrily to the situation, including Richard Kneen who owns a property on Glen Road. He said work being carried out on the river was a ""totally unnecessary project"" and management at Manx Utilities should be held accountable. ""The whole thing was an unmitigated disaster down here that could have been prevented,"" he said. ""Heads should roll for this, there's millions of pounds worth of damage."" While he said he had been ""lucky"", Mr Kneen said others had been ""absolutely devastated"". Many properties suffered extensive damage to flooring and furniture Manx Utilities chairman Alex Allinson (right) was told of residents concerns Flooding occurred on Tuesday when the swollen River Laxey burst through a gap in a parallel wall which had been opened to repair a weir. More than 100mm (4in) of rain fell within a 20-hour period, with the heaviest downpour occurring in the early hours of Tuesday morning, said The Met Office. This ""very localised"" rain fell mostly on the northern side of the Snaefell Mountain, which drains into the Laxey River, a spokesman said. Manx Utilities chairman Alex Allinson apologised to those affected and said an ""urgent meeting"" had been called by Chief Minister Howard Quayle. He said a ""combination of factors"" were responsible including debris causing a build-up of water which led to a ""surge"", he said. The repair work had been due to be completed by the end of September but delays meant it had been extended for a week. He said a ""full analysis"" was under way. Chief Minister Howard Quayle (left) visited Laxey to speak to those affected Chief Minister Quayle, who visited the village and spoke to some of the residents affected, said the government would be examining all possible factors. ""We need to get to the bottom of what had caused the problem, fix it, and ensure it doesn't happen again. ""We'll be putting in place an action plan to make sure that the chances of this happening again are as remote as possible."" Meanwhile, members of a parliamentary scrutiny committee have written to the government asking for ""an urgent overview of events"" that unfolded in Laxey. Rob Callister said: ""We want to establish the facts. There are a lot of angry residents that need answers quickly."" Debris washed downstream is being removed from the river The Mountain Road reopened overnight but is currently closed to allow safety work, the Department for Infrastructure said. Laxey and Dhoon primary schools which were closed during the flooding have reopened as normal, the Isle of Man government said. It is the second time in four years the village of Laxey has been hit by flooding. In December 2015, heavy rain led to part of a road bridge over the river being washed away.

"Tesco's chief executive Dave Lewis is to leave next year after leading a turnaround plan for Britain's biggest supermarket chain. In a move that surprised analysts, Mr Lewis - who took the helm in 2014 - said the decision was ""personal"". Ken Murphy, who has held senior positions at the owner of chemist chain Boots, will replace him. The departure was announced as Tesco reported a 6.7% rise in first-half profits to Â£494m. Tesco chairman John Allan said he had accepted Mr Lewis' resignation with ""regret"" and said the chief executive intended to leave ""in the summer of 2020"". Mr Lewis said: ""I believe the tenure of a chief executive should be a finite one and that now is the right time to pass the baton. The turnaround is complete, we have delivered all the metrics we set ourselves."" The 54-year-old added: ""I am going to take some proper time out, recharge the batteries and think about what comes next."" Analysts at Shore Capital said he was ""the bloke that saved Tesco"". He took the helm at a tumultuous time for the supermarket group, announcing shortly after he took over in 2014 that the retailer had been overstating its profits. Jack: Tesco's Lewis inherited a badly-damaged business Tesco's new discount chain Jack's takes on Aldi and Lidl Tesco to cut 4,500 jobs across 153 Metro stores Tesco to buy Budgens and Londis brand owner Booker The company subsequently revealed a loss of Â£6.4bn,the biggest-ever suffered by a UK retailer Since then Mr Lewis has set about reducing costs, with the latest of round job cuts announced in August when it said 4,500 staff in 153 Tesco Metro stores would lose their roles. He also took on the discounters Aldi and Lidl by opening Jacks, Tesco's own discount chain. Mr Lewis also orchestrated Tesco's 2017 takeover of Booker, the biggest food wholesaler, in a Â£3.7bn deal to create the ""UK's leading food business"". Bernstein analyst Bruno Monteyne told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that there had been speculation about Mr Lewis' future after that deal as Booker's chief executive Charles Wilson had joined at the time. ""We're all trying to grapple exactly about the timing right now,"" said Mr Monteyne. His departure now was ""a total surprise"", he said. Mr Lewis had joined five years ago ""at a very difficult moment"" for Tesco, Mr Monteyne said. ""Not only had it lost the trust of the customers, losing material market to the discounters, it ended up with an accounting fraud... internal morale broken. He really took over a broken company, and from being the most profitable retailer in Europe, suddenly had losses for the first time ever."" As with comedy, timing is everything in big business. Many chief executives overstay their welcome, failing to realise that the clock is always ticking; the average tenure of a FTSE 350 chief executive is 4.5 years, and coming down. Dave Lewis, however, is clever enough to know that it's best to leave while the going is good. He joined Tesco when it was in disarray and at a time of some drama. There had been a string of profits warnings, a boardroom bust-up leading to the departure of the chief executive and a nasty accounting scandal. Mr Lewis moved quickly and the returns show in today's half-year results, which were rather overshadowed by Mr Lewis's departure. Sales were flat, but the operating margin hit 4%, a year before Mr Lewis said it would. That is an achievement but Mr Lewis will know that running Tesco will not get any easier. Keeping Tesco at that level of operating margin is going to be a long, hard slog. There will inevitably be speculation that he will return to Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch consumer goods giant where he worked before joining Tesco. The shares initially dipped but were trading nearly 2% higher at 243p as the results for the six months to 24 August were better than expected. Operating profit, excluding  one-off items, rose by 25% at Â£1.4bn. Like-for-like sales, which strip out revenue from new stores opened during the six months, rose 0.1% in the UK and Ireland. At a group level, including operations in central Europe, notably Poland, and Asia, same store sales fell 0.4%. Ken Murphy will have a Â£1.35m salary When Mr Lewis joined Tesco from household goods company Unilever he was the first outsider to run the supermarket chain. Speculation will turn to what he will do next, but Mr Lewis said: ""I'm going to step back and have a think about what I want to do next with my family. I'm 54 years old and I'm going to sit back and think where I can make the best contribution."" His successor, Mr Murphy, has also been hired from outside after a lengthy career with Boots, which is now part of  Walgreens Boots Alliance. The 52 year-old graduated from University College Cork and was educated at the Christian Brothers College. The Irishman left Walgreens Boots Alliance in January 2019 when his last role was chief commercial officer, president of global brands. He remains as a consultant. But he held a wide-range of roles, including a two year period as chief operating officer of Boots until October 2013. At Tesco, his salary will be Â£1.35m salary before bonuses, and his joining date has not yet been confirmed. ""We would imagine that Mr Lewis may have been familiar with his replacement from his Unilever personal care days,"" said analysts at Shore Capital. ""Mr Murphy has big shoes to fill."" They expect continuity for now but when Mr Murphy does take the helm he will face a number of challenges: Deciding whether Jacks is an effective way to take on Lidl and Aldi Assessing any long-term impact of Brexit on its supply chain Adapting to the changing shopping habits of consumers Considering the extent of the group's international business Mr Allen described Mr Murphy as ""growth-orientated seasoned business leader"" and said he had been  been looking for ""experience, proven leadership in international retail businesses, a strong strategic mind"" In preparation for Brexit, Tesco said it was increasing its stock of long-life shelf products and noted that the UK imports about 50% of fresh food it needs.

"US President Donald Trump suggested shooting migrants in the legs to slow them down, according to a new book. The book, by two New York Times journalists, says Mr Trump suggested extreme methods of deterring migrants from crossing the southern border. They included building an electrified, spiked border wall and a snake or alligator-infested moat. Calling the claims ""fake news"", Mr Trump tweeted: ""I may be tough on border security, but not that tough."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Building a wall on the border with Mexico is one of Mr Trump's main policy objectives. The construction of the wall has now begun, with the Pentagon allocating $3.6bn (Â£2.9bn) of military funding towards its development.

Trump's border wall - in seven charts Step into the shoes of a migrant to America Migrant children crisis: The big picture explained It chronicles a week in March 2019 when Mr Trump reportedly tried to halt all southern migration to the US. According to an excerpt, the president privately suggested to aides that soldiers shoot migrants in the legs, but he was told it would be illegal. Previously, Mr Trump had made a public statement suggesting soldiers shoot migrants who throw rocks. Mr Trump suggested other extreme measures, according to the book. ""Privately, the president had often talked about fortifying a border wall with a water-filled trench, stocked with snakes or alligators, prompting aides to seek a cost estimate. He wanted the wall electrified, with spikes on top that could pierce human flesh,"" reads the extract. This video can not be played Cartels, kidnap and torture on the US border The excerpt describes Mr Trump ordering aides to enforce a complete shutdown of the US-Mexico border by noon the following day, leaving advisers ""in a near panic"" and ""desperately"" trying to placate the president. ""Mr Trump's order to close the border was a decision point that touched off a frenzied week of presidential rages, round-the-clock staff panic and far more White House turmoil than was known at the time,"" the excerpt says. Aides reportedly managed to change Mr Trump's idea of closing the border, but the president later pushed out a number of senior aides who he believed were frustrating his immigration crackdown, including Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen. Use our interactive bot that tells the story of one woman, Maria, who represents the real experiences of many of those seeking to make the journey to the US. Mr Trump has made a crackdown on illegal migration a key priority of his presidency since his 2016 election campaign. The Republican president's stance has led to frequent run-ins with Democrats in Congress, with particular flashpoints including the conditions within migrant detention facilities and funding for the wall. In February,Mr Trump declared an emergency on the US-Mexico borderto free up federal funding. In June, he signed a 90-day deal with Mexico aimed at reducing the flow of migrants crossing into the US. The deal involved initiatives like closer bilateral co-operation and Mexico deploying thousands of National Guard troops throughout the country. Last month, Mexico reported that it had successfully curbed the number of undocumented migrants crossing into the US by 56% since May. However, while figures show that illegal border crossings into the US have seen an overall decline since 2000, they have been rising again since Mr Trump took office. The current financial year has so far seen more than 800,000 people detained on the southern US border - already twice the total for 2018. Many of those arriving are fleeing violence or poverty and travel north through Mexico until they reach the US border. Trump wall: How much has he actually built?

" How Saudi Arabia's crown prince rose to power By Frank Gardner Jeddah, September 2013, and under a blazing Red Sea sun the palace guards stepped aside as our car swept through the reinforced gates. It had taken days to get an audience with the ageing then-Saudi Crown Prince and Defence Minister Salman bin Abdulaziz. Years earlier, in 2004, Prince Salman had been governor of Riyadh when gunmen ambushed our BBC team, shooting me six times, leaving me for dead and killing my Irish cameraman, Simon Cumbers. I’m told the prince visited me in hospital but I have no recollection since I was in a medically induced coma. Today Salman is king and in frail health. Even then, in 2013, I noticed he was resting his hand on a walking stick as we sat on ornate gilt chairs in a palace reception room. His long, solemn face cracked frequently into a smile as he spoke slowly, in English, in a deep, stentorian voice, telling me how much he liked London.  Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia He had seen extraordinary changes. As governor of the Saudi capital Riyadh for five decades, he had watched it morph from a dusty desert town of 200,000 into a teeming metropolis of over five million people. Throughout this royal meeting I was only vaguely aware of someone sitting behind me at the back of the room, quietly taking notes. I assumed, wrongly, that he must have been some sort of chef de cabinet, a private secretary to the crown prince. I could see he was tall and heavily built, with neatly trimmed stubble. He was wearing the traditional bisht - the cloak hemmed with gold embroidery that denotes rank and standing. The audience over, I introduced myself to this silent note-taker. We shook hands and I asked him who he was. “I am Prince Mohammed bin Salman,” he replied, adding modestly, “I am a lawyer. You have been speaking to my father.” I had absolutely no idea, on that baking hot afternoon in Jeddah, that this quietly spoken and still relatively unknown 28-year-old was set to become one of the most powerful and yet most controversial leaders the Arab world had ever seen. The last known sighting of Jamal Khashoggi, entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul The last known sighting of Jamal Khashoggi, entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul On 2 October at 13:14, Jamal Khashoggi walked into a nondescript beige building in the Levent area of Istanbul. A prominent writer and outspoken critic of MBS, he was only visiting the Saudi consulate to get some divorce papers certified. But once inside he was overpowered by a hit team of security and intelligence agents sent from Riyadh, murdered, dismembered and his body disposed of, never to be found. Thousands have died in the war that has devastated Yemen, many through Saudi-led airstrikes. Hundreds of Saudis critical of MBS’s policies have vanished into prisons. And yet it took this particularly gruesome murder of a journalist to turn much of the world against the Saudi crown prince. Despite official Saudi denials, Western intelligence agencies believe that at the very least it was highly likely MBS knew in advance about the operation to silence Khashoggi. According to reports,the CIA believes he actually ordered it. In an interview aired on 29 September with CBS 60 Minutes, the crown prince went so far as to “take full responsibility” for what happened. In an earlier PBS interview he said it happened  “under his watch”. Yet this is not the same as accepting culpability, which he and his government still deny. A key link in this whole, hideous murder mystery is one of MBS’s closest former advisers, a 41-year-old ex-air force man, Saud al-Qahtani. Until he was dismissed from his job soon after the Khashoggi murder- on the orders of King Salman - he was the crown prince’s unofficial gatekeeper in the all-powerful royal court. Jamal Khashoggi Jamal Khashoggi One of the few pictures of Saud al-Qahtani - his Twitter profile image One of the few pictures of Saud al-Qahtani - his Twitter profile image Al-Qahtani is said to have managed an aggressive cyber surveillance strategy that monitored Saudis both at home and abroad, using intrusive software programmes. According to some reports, this included turning their mobile phones into bugging devices without the owner knowing. Anyone critical of MBS or his policies found themselves trolled with abusive and threatening messages on social media. With over a million Twitter followers, al-Qahtani was able to mobilise an “army of flies” to harass and shame perceived enemies. By the summer of 2017, with Saudi bloggers, democracy campaigners, human rights activists and others getting rounded up and imprisoned. Jamal Khashoggi knew he, too, was in danger. In June that year, the same month that MBS became crown prince, Khashoggi got out of Saudi Arabia while he could, flying into exile in the US. The 59-year-old journalist had always called himself a Saudi patriot - he used to be the media adviser to the Saudi ambassador to London in the early 2000s, and I would go and have coffee with him in those days. But after moving to the US he wrote Washington Post columns that grew increasingly critical of MBS’s autocratic style. The crown prince is said to have become irritated. The journalist started to receive calls from Riyadh urging him to return, promising him safe passage and even a job in government. Khashoggi didn’t trust these assurances. He told friends that al-Qahtani’s team had hacked into his emails and text messages and read conversations with other dissenting figures. Khashoggi and others had a plan to launch a movement for free speech in the Arab world. He had 1.6 million Twitter followers and was one of the Middle East’s most prominent journalists. To MBS and his close advisers, Khashoggi would have been seen as a clear and present threat, although again, the crown prince denied this in his CBS interview. Historically, there have been several cases of the Saudi leadership abducting a number of “wayward” citizens, even princes, and taking them back to Riyadh to “bring them back into line”, as commentators have put it. But not murder. An assassination in a foreign city would have been a drastic departure from their normal modus operandi. Khashoggi’s death quickly became an international scandal. After an initial, bungled explanation of what might have happened to Khashoggi in Istanbul, the Saudi authorities have gone to great lengths to distance MBS from the scandal. It was a rogue operation, they said, a case of people grossly exceeding their orders or taking matters into their own hands. But the CIA, and other Western spy agencies, have listened to the gruesome audio tapes that Turkey’s MIT intelligence agency secretly recorded from inside the Saudi Consulate.

To date, there is still no “smoking gun” that unequivocally ties MBS to the murder. But a classified CIA assessment obtained by theWall Street Journalshowed at least 11 text messages sent by MBS to al-Qahtani before, during and after Khashoggi was murdered. And let’s be clear here. In the Gulf Arab states, where I have lived and worked for years, there is no such thing as “a rogue operation”. They simply do not happen. Nothing, but nothing, gets done in the Gulf without sign-off from above. A Turkish policeman stands outside the door of the Saudi consulate in Istanbul A Turkish policeman stands outside the door of the Saudi consulate in Istanbul Khashoggi's murder sparked protests across the world Khashoggi's murder sparked protests across the world In August 2018 last year, before the murder, Saud al-Qahtani put out a telling tweet. It ran: “Do you think I make decisions without guidance? I am an employee and an executor of the orders of the King and the Crown Prince.” No-one has suggested King Salman himself had anything to do with the murder. But the plot does appear to have been hatched from right within his favourite son’s inner circle. “It is inconceivable,” said one former British intelligence officer, “that MBS did not know about it.” So where is al-Qahtani and why isn’t he on trial? I put this question recently to the newly appointed Saudi Ambassador to London, Prince Khalid bin Bandar al-Saud. The ambassador assured me that al-Qahtani had been removed from his post and was being investigated. If he is found to be involved he will be prosecuted, he told me. But reports from Riyadh show that although he is keeping a low profile, al-Qahtani has not been detained. “He is not showing up at court but he’s still involved in cyber-security issues and other projects,” says one Gulf resident with close knowledge of MBS’s circle. “He’s lying low but they are tapping into his expertise.” The commentator went further, adding that to the people around MBS, al-Qahtani is someone who “took one for the team”. “Yes, the operation [in Istanbul] went wrong but he executed his orders.” The Saudis have put 11 men on trial over the Khashoggi case. Proceedings began in January and nine months later there is still no word of any convictions or punishments or even an indication of when the trial might conclude. The Saudi justice system is notoriously opaque at the best of times, with judgements often left to the whim of a judge rather than following any prescribed penal code. One senior figure who has been named by the authorities is Maj-Gen Ahmed al-Assiri, the deputy head of intelligence and previously the spokesman for the controversial Saudi-led air campaign in the Yemen war. Having met him in Riyadh on several occasions, al-Assiri did not strike me as the sort of person to come up with a plan without first getting clearance from above. Whatever the eventual outcome of the shadowy trial one thing is clear - the Khashoggi murder has done enormous and lasting damage to both MBS’s and Saudi Arabia’s global reputation. “Let me be clear,” the Saudi ambassador to London told me in September, with surprising frankness for such a senior member of the ruling family. “The Khashoggi murder was a stain on our country, our government and our people. I wish it hadn’t happened.”  On 2 October at 13:14, Jamal Khashoggi walked into a nondescript beige building in the Levent area of Istanbul. A prominent writer and outspoken critic of MBS, he was only visiting the Saudi consulate to get some divorce papers certified. But once inside he was overpowered by a hit team of security and intelligence agents sent from Riyadh, murdered, dismembered and his body disposed of, never to be found. Jamal Khashoggi Jamal Khashoggi Thousands have died in the war that has devastated Yemen, many through Saudi-led airstrikes. Hundreds of Saudis critical of MBS’s policies have vanished into prisons. And yet it took this particularly gruesome murder of a journalist to turn much of the world against the Saudi crown prince. Despite official Saudi denials, Western intelligence agencies believe that at the very least it was highly likely MBS knew in advance about the operation to silence Khashoggi. According to reports,the CIA believes he actually ordered it. In an interview aired on 29 September with CBS 60 Minutes, the crown prince went so far as to “take full responsibility” for what happened.  In an earlier PBS interview he said it happened  “under his watch”.  Yet this is not the same as accepting culpability, which he and his government still deny. A key link in this whole, hideous murder mystery is one of MBS’s closest former advisers, a 41-year-old ex-air force man, Saud al-Qahtani. Until he was dismissed from his job soon after the Khashoggi murder- on the orders of King Salman - he was the crown prince’s unofficial gatekeeper in the all-powerful royal court. Al-Qahtani is said to have managed an aggressive cyber surveillance strategy that monitored Saudis both at home and abroad, using intrusive software programmes. According to some reports, this included turning their mobile phones into bugging devices without the owner knowing. Anyone critical of MBS or his policies found themselves trolled with abusive and threatening messages on social media. With over a million Twitter followers, al-Qahtani was able to mobilise an “army of flies” to harass and shame perceived enemies.

Jamal Khashoggi knew he too was in danger. In June that year, the same month that MBS became crown prince, Khashoggi got out of Saudi Arabia while he could, flying into exile in the US. The 59-year-old journalist had always called himself a Saudi patriot - he used to be the media adviser to the Saudi ambassador to London in the early 2000s and I would go and have coffee with him in those days. But after moving to the US he wrote Washington Post columns that grew increasingly critical of MBS’s autocratic style. The crown prince is said to have become irritated. The journalist started to receive calls from Riyadh urging him to return, promising him safe passage and even a job in government. Khashoggi didn’t trust these assurances. He told friends that al-Qahtani’s team had hacked into his emails and text messages and read conversations with other dissenting figures. Khashoggi and others had a plan to launch a movement for free speech in the Arab world. He had 1.6 million Twitter followers and was one of the Middle East’s most prominent journalists. To MBS and his close advisers, Khashoggi would have been seen as a clear and present threat, although again, the crown prince denied this in his CBS interview. Historically, there have been several cases of the Saudi leadership abducting a number of “wayward” citizens, even princes, and taking them back to Riyadh to “bring them back into line”, as commentators have put it. But not murder. An assassination in a foreign city would have been a drastic departure from their normal modus operandi.

After an initial, bungled explanation of what might have happened to Khashoggi in Istanbul, the Saudi authorities have gone to great lengths to distance MBS from the scandal. It was a rogue operation, they said, a case of people grossly exceeding their orders or taking matters into their own hands. But the CIA, and other Western spy agencies, have listened to the gruesome audio tapes that Turkey’s MIT intelligence agency secretly recorded from inside the Saudi Consulate. And when the US launched sanctions against 17 individuals it suspected of being involved in the murder, Saud al-Qahtani was top of the list.

A huge, mixed crowd of young Saudis in Western dress is moving in time to the music, smartphones raised above their shoulders, lasers and lights criss-crossing the auditorium. David Guetta, the French house DJ, is on the decks. At the same venue, women exercise their newfound freedom to drive by arriving in their own top-of-the-range sports cars to watch Riyadh’s inaugural Formula E race. There are concerts by the Black Eyed Peas and Enrique Iglesias. This is the new Saudi Arabia as decreed by its modernising crown prince. Entertainment is in, cultural austerity is out. For anyone who has lived in or visited Saudi Arabia over the past 40 years, this transformation is quite extraordinary.  Car and bike rally in Jeddah Car and bike rally in Jeddah Such a free mingling of the sexes in a party atmosphere would have been totally unthinkable only a short while ago, forbidden by the conservative religious clerics on whose support the ruling family has relied for its legitimacy. The Saudi Arabia I have always known has had an ascetic, joyless public face, a place where the Mutawwa, the religious police, closed down popular shisha cafes in Riyadh and ordered shops not to play music as part of their own strict interpretation of Sharia [Islamic law]. Since becoming crown prince in 2017, MBS has set out - with the king’s backing - to reverse this image of Saudi Arabia being a fun-free zone. Cinemas, women driving, public entertainment - all were banned for years. Now, he has said, he wants to make his country a softer, kinder place. The Kingdom's ban on cinemas was only lifted in 2018 The Kingdom's ban on cinemas was only lifted in 2018 ‘What happened in the last 30 years is not Saudi Arabia,” MBS pronounced in October 2017.  “After the Iranian revolution in 1979 people wanted to copy this model in different countries, one of them is Saudi Arabia. We didn’t know how to deal with it. And the problem spread all over the world. Now is the time to get rid of it.” In fact, Saudi Arabia, a profoundly tribal and conservative country, has never enjoyed the sort of charms and distractions of urban Arab melting pots like say, Cairo or Baghdad. Nevertheless, MBS’s words were exactly what the White House wanted to hear. By then, close ties had already been forged between Washington and the new crown prince. Donald Trump chose Riyadh for his first overseas presidential visit in May 2017, and his son-in-law Jared Kushner formed a close working relationship with MBS. March 2018: MBS with Donald Trump in the White House March 2018: MBS with Donald Trump in the White House Pursuing a “moderate Islam”, MBS has issued permits for public concerts and even a Coptic Christian mass. At home, his popularity has soared, especially among the predominantly young population who are tired of being ruled by men more than half a century older than them. MBS is just 34 - the first national leader young Saudis can relate to. “He loves fast food, like hot dogs, and he drinks a lot of Diet Coke,” says one Gulf businessman, who does not want to be named. MBS is said to have grown up playing Call of Duty and to be a huge admirer of tech.  At an investment forum in Riyadh in November 2018 young Saudi women were rushing up and asking to take selfies with the crown prince. He was only too happy to oblige, his stern, inscrutable features breaking into a film star grin. “He’s been a long-awaited leader in Saudi Arabia,” says Malek Dahlan, an international lawyer. “Saudi hasn’t seen someone of his charisma since his grandfather, King Abdulaziz.” “My impression,” says Sir William Patey, who was Britain’s ambassador to Riyadh from 2006-2010, “is that most Saudis, particularly the young, support the crown prince and the direction of travel.” In reference to MBS’s extraordinary concentration of power into his own hands, he adds: “They have traditionally seen authority more dispersed but understand that big change requires more decisive decision making.” Another former British diplomat who has met MBS on numerous occasions but, like many, prefers not to be named, says: “MBS has this extraordinary self-belief. He’s like a solar flare. He just explodes into ideas and energy. He can be over-confident and there is a streak of amateurism there.” But there is also a streak of something altogether more sinister. Human rights activists outside the Saudi embassy in Paris Human rights activists outside the Saudi embassy in Paris If one were to characterise MBS’s attitude to the seismic social and economic reforms he is pushing through, it would be: “It’s either my way or the highway.” Put simply, MBS doesn’t do dissent. Bloggers, clerics, women’s rights protesters, people from both the liberal and conservative ends of the spectrum, have all ended up getting arrested under draconian catch-all laws that stifle all dissent or discussion. In its annual report, Human Rights Watch revealed that “the Saudi authorities stepped up their arbitrary arrests, trials and convictions of peaceful dissidents and activists in 2018, including a large-scale coordinated crackdown against the women’s rights movement”. But isn’t this the same ruler who finally gave Saudi women the right to drive? Well, yes. But the point is, say observers, that MBS wants the change to come from the top down, from the Royal Court. Any suggestion of the law being changed or reforms being enacted as a result of some popular street-level movement, however small, is deemed a dangerous one in a country that has no political parties or opposition. Take Loujain al-Hathloul, for example. Educated, intelligent, active on social media, she spent her 30th birthday in prison in Jeddah this past July. Her family say her only crime was to campaign for Saudi women to be allowed to drive and for an end to the restrictive guardianship system that gives men enormous control over the lives of their wives and female relatives. Both laws have now been changed for the better - women can drive and the guardianship system has been relaxed. But al-Hathloul and several other female activists appear to have annoyed the Saudi leadership by publicly pushing for something that MBS would prefer to take the credit for. You do not try to force the pace of change in the kingdom. Al-Hathloul was first arrested in in 2014 after driving her car from the UAE into Saudi Arabia. In March 2018, while driving legally in the UAE, she was reportedly pulled over by a convoy of blacked-out vehicles, arrested and rendered back to Riyadh where she was briefly detained. In May 2018 she was again arrested in the wider crackdown. Al-Hathloul and other female activists say they have been tortured and spent time in solitary confinement. ""During the first three months, during the sessions of interrogations, they were subjected to acts of torture and other ill treatments that included flogging, electric shocks, sexual harassment,” says Lynn Maalouf, from Amnesty International. The Saudi authorities have denied that any torture takes place in their prisons or police cells and promised to investigate. But instead of their alleged abusers facing charges, the women themselves were charged. Walid al-Hathloul, Loujain’s brother, who lives outside the country, says the prosecutor never investigated the claims of torture. “We sent three complaints and they never responded. The prosecutor reached his conclusion based on the Saudi Human Rights Commission and not on their own (independent) investigation.” Walid al-Hathloul is also pressing for Saud al-Qahtani to be investigated, with Loujain alleging he personally took part in her abuse in detention.

He promised to personally investigate.

Yet in August 2019, Loujain al-Hathloul’s family said that security officers had visited her in jail and put pressure on her to sign a statement denying her relatives’ claims that she had been tortured in custody. She refused. Other detained female activists include Samar Badawi, arrested after challenging the guardianship laws, Iman al-Nafjan, blogger and campaigner for women’s right to drive and Aziza al-Yousef, retired university professor who has helped women escape domestic abuse. But at home there is not much public sympathy for the women’s plight. There is little if any media coverage inside the kingdom and a trolling campaign saw them branded unpatriotic traitors. The authorities claimed they had passed secrets to enemies of the state. There are also many cases of male activists being detained and punished. In September 2018, Saudi prosecutors announced a penalty of five years in prison and a fine of three million riyals (£600,000) for anyone caught sharing anything on social media deemed by the authorities to affect public order or morals. Yet MBS is unapologetic about his intolerance of dissent. In interviews he has admitted that large numbers of people are behind bars but said that this is somehow a necessary price to be paid when you are driving through such a sweeping reform programme. So how exactly did a man who was virtually unknown six years ago come to be arguably the most powerful ruler in the Middle East?

In interviews he has admitted that large numbers of people are behind bars but said that this is somehow a necessary price to be paid when you are driving through such a sweeping reform programme. So how exactly did a man who was virtually unknown six years ago come to be arguably the most powerful ruler in the Middle East? Born on 31 August 1985, Mohammed bin Salman grew up, like nearly all the estimated 5,000 senior Saudi princes, in a closeted world of extraordinary comfort and privilege. As one of 13 children, his childhood was a walled and well-guarded Riyadh palace in the Madher neighbourhood. Servants, cooks, drivers and other expatriate employees catered to his every whim. One of those who tutored him in his early years, in the mid-1990s, was Rachid Sekkai, who now works for the BBC. He has described being collected from home each day in a chauffeured car to bring him to the palace. “Once through the heavily guarded gates, the car would wind past a series of jaw-dropping villas with immaculate gardens maintained by workers in white uniforms,” he told BBC Arabic. “There was a car park filled with a fleet of exclusive luxury cars.” Some accounts have talked of MBS being a studious pupil, always taking careful notes, but Sekkai says he found him more interested in spending time with palace guards than following his lessons. “He seemed to be allowed to do as he pleased,” he said. Offered the chance by his father to study abroad in the US or Britain, as so many of his peers had done, MBS declined. Instead, he gained a bachelor’s degree in law at King Saud University. This unusual decision, say observers, has both helped and hindered him. For many Saudis, an intensely patriotic nation, his exclusively Saudi upbringing makes him a traditional “son of the land”, someone they can identify with. But the downside is that for years MBS’s English was poor and he has never really gained the kind of innate understanding of Western mentality that so many other princes acquire. King Saud University, where MBS was a student King Saud University, where MBS was a student In a country where it’s not uncommon for men to have up to four wives, MBS chose to have only one. He married his cousin - a common practice - Princess Sara bint Mashur bin Abdulaziz al-Saud in 2009 and they have two sons and two daughters. When it comes to his own family, MBS is intensely private. So how did he move so quickly from being an obscure graduate of law and one of thousands of Saudi royals to becoming the all-powerful crown prince he is today? The answer lies in an extraordinary blend of Machiavellian power politics, paternal patronage and sheer force of character. MBS's personal superyacht, the Serene, bought for 500m euros MBS's personal superyacht, the Serene, bought for 500m euros When MBS was about 23, soon after he graduated close to the top of his class, his father began preparing him for a senior role. MBS worked in his father’s office, shadowing him in his work as governor of Riyadh. The attentive young MBS saw how Prince Salman settled disputes and forged compromises, effectively learning the art of Saudi statecraft. In 2013, at the age of just 27, MBS was made head of the crown prince’s court, effectively a gateway to power and influence. The next year he was promoted to cabinet minister. Then in 2015, MBS’s career moved into high gear. The Saudi royal line of succession from Abdulaziz to Salman The Saudi royal line of succession from Abdulaziz to Salman When King Abdullah died in January of that year, he was succeeded by his half-brother Salman from the powerful Sudairi branch of the family. The new king, already nearly 80 when he took the throne, was now free to favour exactly who he chose. His favourite son Mohammed - MBS - was promptly made minister of defence as well as secretary-general of the Royal Court. By now Saudi Arabia was facing a mounting crisis on its southern border. In Yemen the Houthis, a group of tribesmen from the northern mountains, had marched on the capital Sanaa, ousted the elected president and his government and had seized control of almost the entire, more populated, western half of the country. The Houthis’ ideological and religious links with Iran rattled Saudi nerves. In March 2015, without consulting several key princes and giving almost no warning to Saudi Arabia’s allies, MBS pulled together a coalition of 10 nations and led his country into an air war against the Houthis. The official aim was to restore the ousted but UN-recognised government in Yemen. The unstated aim was to send a blunt message to Iran - Saudi Arabia was not going to allow an Iranian-backed proxy militia to take over its southern neighbour. This was supposed to be a quick and decisive military intervention against a ragtag army of rebels armed with Soviet-era weapons. Instead, it has turned into a quagmire that is bleeding Saudi blood and treasure as well as devastating Yemen. Saudi border guard facing Yemen Saudi border guard facing Yemen The Saudi-led coalition has made precious little progress on the ground. Nearly five years on, Yemen has been pulverised by war, with thousands killed. Malnutrition, cholera and disease are rife, while an estimated 20 million people, about two-thirds of the population, are in need of aid. But at home, the beginning of the war won MBS instant popularity. He had no military experience whatsoever but Saudi TV showed a “warrior prince” acting decisively in his country’s interests. Western nations were initially highly supportive. The US provided intelligence and refuelling as well as hardware. Britain provided logistical and technical support as well as advice to the Saudi armed forces on equipment sold to them by BAE Systems. Two RAF squadron leaders were stationed inside the Coalition Air Operations Centre in Riyadh to monitor Saudi targeting procedures, although the MoD insists they did not choose targets. Royal Saudi Air Force targeting has turned out to be frequently flawed. Scenes from the war in Yemen Scenes from the war in Yemen The aftermath of a Saudi missile strike on the Yemeni city of Sana'a The aftermath of a Saudi missile strike on the Yemeni city of Sana'a Hospitals, funerals, residential areas andschool buseshave been blasted to smithereens, alongside legitimate military targets. The UN estimates that the majority of civilian casualties in Yemen have been caused by Saudi-led airstrikes. The Saudis have been accused of using cluster bombs on civilian areas. The Houthis too are accused of war crimes, laying mines indiscriminately, employing child soldiers, shelling houses and withholding aid. By September 2019 the Houthis had - according to the Saudis -fired more than 260 ballistic missilesand 50 explosive drones across the border. Yet this is dwarfed by the overwhelming air superiority of the Saudi-led coalition. Led by human rights groups like Amnesty International, there has been a growing chorus of Western public dismay at the casualties in Yemen. In the space of five years, Yemen has become the world’s worst humanitarian crisis. Ritz-Carlton Hotel, Riyadh Ritz-Carlton Hotel, Riyadh On 20 June 2017 something happened, behind the gilded doors of a royal palace in Mecca, that effectively changed the course of Saudi history. The crown prince at the time, Mohammed bin Nayef, was summoned by the king and ordered to step aside in favour of his much younger cousin: MBS. For years the veteran Prince Mohammed bin Nayef had been a safe pair of hands. During the 2000s, as head of counter-terrorism and later interior minister, he had masterminded the defeat of a serious insurgency by al-Qaeda. He was liked and trusted by the Americans and, although certainly not a dynamic figure, he was seen as a steady choice as next in line to the throne. But the word was that he had never fully recovered from a failed assassination attempt in 2009 when al-Qaeda managed to smuggle a suicide bomber right into the same room as him. King Salman had made his decision as to who he wanted to succeed him and it was his favoured son, MBS. In Saudi Arabia the king’s power is absolute - there was no debate, no resistance. Mohammed bin Nayef has since vanished completely from public life. Former Crown Prince Mohammed bin Nayef has disappeared from public life Former Crown Prince Mohammed bin Nayef has disappeared from public life MBS and his father had pulled off what amounted to a spectacular and bloodless palace coup. Highly ambitious and determined to reshape the country, MBS promptly set out to cement his hold on power. Late in the evening of Saturday 4 November 2017, orders went out to arrest about 200 prominent princes, business leaders and others. There were no charges, no prison cells - instead they were incarcerated in Riyadh’s luxurious Ritz-Carlton Hotel, in some cases for months. It was billed as an anti-corruption drive and the hotel’s new “guests” were ordered to hand over billions of riyals in alleged ill-gotten gains as the price for their freedom. But critics of MBS contend this was less about corruption, instead it was a naked power play to neutralise anyone who could possibly challenge him. At the same time MBS moved against senior princes from the late King Abdullah’s once-powerful branch of the family. He has since brought all three elements of the country’s defence and security forces under his control: the National Guard, the Ministry of Interior and the Military. MBS’s power appears absolute. The Ritz-Carlton arrests sent shockwaves through the business world and rattled foreign investors. How could people know who it was safe to do business with? Who would be next?

The country may be the world’s biggest oil producer but a surprisingly large number of its citizens live in poverty, especially in the south. The sight of so many previously untouchable merchants and princes being “shaken down” earned MBS even more followers at home. Another key plank in his domestic popularity is his efforts to transform the Saudi economy by diversifying away from oil, turning the country into an investment powerhouse and providing meaningful jobs for millions of under-employed young Saudis. The Vision 2030 plan is nothing if not ambitious. It envisages a future, not far off, where Saudi Arabia has become the global hub connecting Europe, Asia and Africa. It includes a US$64bn fund to develop entertainment and aims to create a million new jobs in domestic tourism. April 2016: MBS launches Vision 2030 in Riyadh April 2016: MBS launches Vision 2030 in Riyadh But here too the dark spectre of the Khashoggi murder has cast a shadow. Some - but not all - foreign investors have scaled back or cancelled their interest in supporting the crown prince’s plans, wary of being associated with someone still under international suspicion for his alleged involvement in that murder. But Vision 2030 is going ahead and it includes an extraordinary, futuristic project called NEOM - standing for Neo-Mustaqbal or New Future. Far up in the northwest corner of Saudi Arabia, where the balmy waters of the Red Sea wash up against the shores of Egypt, Jordan and Israel, plans are afoot to create a 21st Century megacity. Where today there is little more than wind-blasted sand and black, volcanic rock, a searing desert where TE Lawrence and an Arab army fought the Turks during World War One, there is planned to be a US$500bn cross-border project spanning 26,000 sq km. NEOM is intended to be a city dominated by drones, driverless cars, robotic assistants, artificial intelligence, solar powered greenhouses, the “internet of things” and biotech. Officially it’s due to be up and running by 2025. But some economists have their doubts. “No, it’s just not realistic,” says one. “NEOM was always a fantasy and it’s indicative of the distance between ambition and reality that characterises the way MBS looks at the world.” Yet MBS is so confident in the project I am told he believes it will one day rival Palo Alto, the home of tech in California. Saudi Arabia does not have a shining track record where new, purpose-built cities are concerned. “Take King Abdullah Economic City,” said another Gulf economist recently. “It was supposed to have two million people in it by 2020. It has just 8,000. So no, he probably can’t deliver on this economic dream.” Progress on the King Abdullah Economic City is said to have been disappointing Progress on the King Abdullah Economic City is said to have been disappointing NEOM is still likely to be built, but at a slower pace than planned. Too much is at stake now. But whether it can attract foreign investment and generate vast numbers of domestic jobs is highly questionable. In September 2018, Boris Johnson took a three-day, all-expenses paid trip to Saudi Arabia, costing his hosts £14,000, all of which was declared to Parliament. Johnson knew nothing about it, but this was just two weeks before the murder of Jamal Khashoggi. March 2018: MBS with Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson in Downing Street March 2018: MBS with Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson in Downing Street Before that time, the arrests of activists were little reported outside Saudi Arabia, and MBS’s stock among Western leaders was running high. Afterwards, such a visit would be almost unthinkable. Now, in the West where he was once feted as a visionary reformer and trailblazer for social reform, he is now largely shunned, at least in public. “The Khashoggi murder propelled Saudi Arabia into The Killers Club,” said one Gulf commentator, who, like so many, has asked not to be named . “It appeared to put MBS into the same category as Gaddafi, Saddam and Assad. This is a club that the Kingdom never used to be a part of.” Privately, business with Saudi Arabia continues apace - the Saudi economy is simply too big and the contracts too lucrative for Western businesses to ignore. President Trump remains a steadfast ally. Congress has tried unsuccessfully to halt multi-billion arms sales to the Kingdom but President Trump has overruled them, on both strategic and financial grounds. The enormous Saudi market, coupled with its perceived strategic value as a bulwark against Iranian expansionism, mean that Western government criticism will probably always be tempered. But already, the obvious Western disapproval of Saudi Arabia’s human rights shortcomings has hit a sensitive nerve in Riyadh. The Saudis are trying to shift the dial. The new envoy to Washington is Princess Reema bint Bandar al-Saud, the country’s first ever female ambassador and a sophisticated businesswoman who has spent years living in the US. Reema will be the public face of Saudi diplomacy in a capital where congressmen and others are now seriously questioning the validity of the US-Saudi partnership. Princess Reema bint Bandar al-Saud, ambassador to Washington Princess Reema bint Bandar al-Saud, ambassador to Washington But the Saudis are also actively exploring relationships with other strategic partners - with Russia, China and Pakistan - none of whom raise awkward questions about Saudi human rights. Over the course of the past 12 months some damning statements and allegations have bubbled up to the surface - notably from US intelligence officials andUN special rapporteur Agnes Callamard- that remind the world that Western suspicions still fall on MBS as having personally ordered the Khashoggi murder. She remains adamant that he must ultimately be held accountable for the murder. Yet at home, MBS’s stock is riding high. “Talk to anyone aged 16-25,” said one Gulf commentator, “and they see him as a hero. They love the socio-cultural changes he’s bringing, pushing back the power of the religious fundamentalists.” There is little sign that under MBS, Saudi Arabia is about to make any real moves towards democracy. Any public questioning, let alone criticism, of the ruling family and its policies carries the risk of imprisonment. For years MBS has enjoyed the absolute backing of his father, King Salman, and there are no obvious challengers to his rule. Within MBS’s Royal Court circle there is a view that the storm in the West over his alleged role in the Khashoggi murder will eventually blow over. They are probably right. In many respects, MBSisSaudi Arabia. He is no democrat, he is no political reformer - to many, he is simply a dictator. But MBS is unquestionably an economic and social moderniser. And at 34 years old he knows that when the king dies he could well end up ruling the largest country in the Middle East not just for a decade, but for the next 50 years.",Positive,1.0
"This video can not be played Calf rescued from water pipe by farmer A three-week-old Aberdeen Angus calf has been saved following a major operation to rescue it from an underground water pipe. Farmer Robert Osborne and stockman Iain Robertson said they struggled for two-and-a-half hours to get the calf free. The alarm was raised on Tuesday after the Durisdeer farmer said he heard the animal making noises in the field. He said they were eventually able to locate and free the calf, nick-named Trouble, with the help of a digger. Mr Osborne said he had not initially believed it was possible for the calf to get into the pipe. ""When I did realise it was in, it sounded really close,"" he said. ""I thought it was not that far away but I got the torch and I couldn't see it."" The whole rescue operation was captured on film by his daughter Grace Tait Osborne. She told BBC Radio Scotland'sJohn Beattie programmehow the incident had unfolded. Mr Osborne said he had not initially thought it was possible for the calf to get stuck down the hole Mr Osborne's daughter captured the rescue operation on film Robert Osborne, right, and Iain Robertson struggled for hours to get the calf free ""I don't know why it went into the water pipe, it was obviously just exploring and got itself a wee bit stuck,"" she said. ""It's a pretty big calf, it had obviously gone in and it was unable to turn itself back round to come out. ""So it had kept walking straight down hoping to get out of the other end but it ended up just getting itself stuck deeper in the water pipe."" After hearing the animal's cries, Mr Osborne and Mr Robertson began digging holes to get better access to the distressed calf. Eventually, they used a box attached to a rope to help them drag the calf to safety. ""Two-and-a-half hours it took us,"" said Mr Osborne. ""It's not really about the value,"" he added. ""Farmers get bad enough press for looking after their animals, but 99.9% of farmers do look after their animals. ""It is a nice wee calf."" Miss Osborne said the animal appeared to be none the worse for its adventure. ""He is up in the shed with his mum now, they are both back together,"" she said. ""They have been taken out of the field and put in a shed for now just so they can keep a closer eye on the calf.""

"The government has delivered its new Brexit proposals to the EU, including plans to replace the Irish backstop. The plan, outlined in a seven-page document,external, would see Northern Ireland stay in the European single market for goods, but leave the customs union - resulting in new customs checks. The Northern Ireland Assembly would get to approve the arrangements first and vote every four years on keeping them. The European Commission said there had been progress but ""problems"" remained. Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said the new blueprint did not ""fully meet the agreed objectives of the backstop"", in terms of upholding the EU's single market, protecting peace in Northern Ireland and supporting economic co-operation with the Republic of Ireland. But he said he wanted an agreement and talks would continue. Kuenssberg: Johnson won't decide next Brexit steps Reality Check: What is in Boris Johnson's Brexit plan? How does the border plan differ from the backstop? The UK is set to leave the EU on 31 October and the government has insisted it will not negotiate a further delay beyond the Halloween deadline. Speaking at the Conservative Party conference earlier on Wednesday, Boris Johnson said the only alternative to his Brexit plan was no-deal. This video can not be played PM: Boris Johnson: ""It (no deal) is not an outcome we want... but is an outcome for which we are ready"" In a letter to European Commission's president,external, Jean-Claude Juncker, the prime minister said the new proposals ""respect the decision taken by the people of the UK to leave the EU, while dealing pragmatically with that decision's consequences in Northern Ireland and in Ireland"". Government sources hoped the UK might be able to enter an intense 10-day period of negotiations with the EU almost immediately, with the aim of coming to a final agreement at an EU summit on 17 October. Mr Juncker welcomed what he said were ""positive advances"" in some areas but he said the UK's proposed system of ""governance"" of the new arrangements was ""problematic"" - and customs rules remained a concern. This video can not be played Chief EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier: ""There is progress, but to be frank, lots of work still needs to be done"" Don't expect the EU to rush to reject the prime minister's proposals even though there are elements that clearly contravene EU red lines, such as the implementation of any kind of customs procedures between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Jean-Claude Juncker spoke today of ""concerns"" arising from the text but EU leaders won't want to be seen to be the ones closing the door to a deal. Throughout the Brexit process they've repeatedly kicked the ball back into the UK government's court. On cue, leaders are ""welcoming the delivery of the proposals from the government"" and inviting the prime minister to continue negotiations. The fundamental questions for the EU remain: How much does does the prime minister really want a deal? Is he willing to move from his apparent ""take it or leave it"" position? If he is, there will be something to talk about. If not, the EU will try its best to avoid being the ones to say ""forget it"". But Mr Johnson should think again if he imagines his proposals, which do include concessions from his side, will prompt EU countries with a lot to lose in a no deal Brexit (like Germany) to try to force Ireland to accept his offer. Angela Merkel today insisted EU leaders would stick together. With such an important EU member leaving, Mrs Merkel believes unity amongst those left behind is paramount. Arlene Foster, leader of Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, supported the plan, saying it would allow Northern Ireland to leave the customs union and single market at the same time as the rest of the UK. Johnson: No-deal only alternative to Brexit plan Several Conservative MPs who opposed Theresa May's agreement also signalled their likely support, with leading Brexiteer Steve Baker saying he was ""cautiously optimistic"". This video can not be played DUP leader says new proposals ""sensible and serious"" But Sinn Fein said the plans were a ""non-starter"" and accused the DUP, their former power-sharing partners of ""working against the interests of the people"" of Northern Ireland. And Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the deal was ""not acceptable"" and ""worse"" than Theresa May's agreement, as it ""undermined"" the Good Friday Agreement that secured peace in Northern Ireland. The prime minister has set out details of his plan to replace theIrish border ""backstop""in the current Brexit agreement. The backstop is the controversial ""insurance policy"" that is meant to keep a free-flowing border on the island of Ireland but which critics - including the PM - fear could trap the UK in EU trading rules indefinitely. Under Mr Johnson's proposals, which he calls a ""broad landing zone"" for a new deal with the EU: Northern Ireland would leave the EU's customs union alongside the rest of the UK, at the start of 2021 But Northern Ireland would, with the consent of politicians in the Northern Ireland Assembly, continue to apply EU legislation relating to agricultural and other products - what he calls an ""all-island regulatory zone"" This arrangement could, in theory, continue indefinitely, but the consent of Northern Ireland's politicians would have to be sought every four years Customs checks on goods traded between the UK and EU would be ""decentralised"", with paperwork submitted electronically and only a ""very small number"" of physical checks These checks should take place away from the border itself, at business premises or at ""other points in the supply chain"" The government is also promising a ""New Deal for Northern Ireland"", with financial commitments to help manage the changes. Mr Johnson has written to the European Commission president about his proposals German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who has spoken to Mr Johnson, said the EU would study the proposals carefully. She said she ""trusted"" the bloc's Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier to maintain European unity. But opponents of Brexit in Parliament indicated they would not support the proposals, unless they were accompanied by the promise of another referendum. The Liberal Democrats, who want to stop Brexit, said the proposals would deal a ""hammer blow"" to the Northern Irish economy. The Scottish National Party dismissed the proposals as ""window dressing"".

"A report says consumers switched to smaller bottle sizes or low-alcohol products, but a drop in demand was offset by increased prices The introduction of minimum pricing for alcohol has had a modest economic impact on the drinks industry in Scotland, a report has found. Thestudy commissioned by NHS Health Scotland,externalsuggests a drop in demand for some products was offset by increased prices. Researchers said retailers adapted to cope with price changes. Scotland was the world's first nation to require all licensed premises to set a minimum unit price (MUP) for alcohol. The policy was designed to increase the cost of cheap, high-strength drinks such as ciders and some spirits seen to cause the most harm. Minimum price 'cuts weekly drinking by half pint' New drink laws 'implemented effectively' Alcohol sales drop as minimum price kicks in In an initial assessment of the effects of MUP, researchers at Frontier Economics evaluated its economic impact on producers and alcohol retailers in the nine months following the introduction of the policy in April 2018. Many reported a decrease in alcohol sales was offset by increased prices and consumers switching to existing premium brands. It said no retailers or producers had reported reducing staff numbers or investment as a result of MUP. Andrew Leicester, manager at Frontier Economics, said: ""The respondents interviewed in this study suggested that demand changed in a number of ways in the first nine months following MUP coming into force, with sales of products that were previously retailing below the minimum unit price decreasing the most. ""Demand for smaller sizes, low-alcohol products or premium products less affected by price increases, has seen some producers and retailers adapt their strategy and product offering in response to MUP."" He emphasised the difficulties in evaluating the full impact of MUP when other factors had also affected the market, notably the 2018 football World Cup and the long, hot summer of that year. Examples of prices Â£14Whisky (70cl bottle at 40% ABV) Â£13.13Vodka (70cl bottle at 37.5% ABV) Â£1Lager (500ml can at 4% ABV) Â£2.50Cider (1 litre bottle at 5% - normal strength) Â£4.69Red wine (75cl bottle at 12.5% ABV) NHS Health Scotland commissioned the research as part of a wide-ranging evaluation of the Alcohol (Minimum Pricing) (Scotland) Act 2012 which established MUP It has a sunset clause which requires the Scottish Parliament to vote before 1st May 2024 on whether or not the policy will continue. Neil Craig, head of evaluation at NHS Health Scotland, said: ""NHS Health Scotland are leading a robust and comprehensive evaluation of Minimum Unit Pricing, which will provide a full understanding of what difference the legislation is making and to whom. ""That of course includes the impact MUP could make to levels of alcohol-related health and social harm, but also requires us to assess the effect on the alcoholic drinks industry in Scotland."" The researchers interviewed retailers on both sides of the Scotland-England border to see if MUP had led to an increase in people from Scotland buying alcohol from stores in England. But they said retailers noted cross-border purchasing was happening prior to the introduction of MUP, as many consumers who live near the border in Scotland work in Carlisle or Berwick-upon-Tweed, or conduct weekly grocery shopping in these towns. Alison Douglas, chief executive of Alcohol Focus Scotland said: ""It's encouraging to see further evidence that MUP has resulted in less alcohol being sold in Scotland and that this has been achieved without any negative impact on the alcohol industry. ""Even a small reduction in the amount of alcohol consumed in Scotland will bring big benefits for people's health."" The next findings from the MUP evaluation are to be published by early 2020 and include the effect of the policy on children and young people.

"Tesco's chief executive Dave Lewis is to leave next year after leading a turnaround plan for Britain's biggest supermarket chain. In a move that surprised analysts, Mr Lewis - who took the helm in 2014 - said the decision was ""personal"". Ken Murphy, who has held senior positions at the owner of chemist chain Boots, will replace him. The departure was announced as Tesco reported a 6.7% rise in first-half profits to Â£494m. Tesco chairman John Allan said he had accepted Mr Lewis' resignation with ""regret"" and said the chief executive intended to leave ""in the summer of 2020"". Mr Lewis said: ""I believe the tenure of a chief executive should be a finite one and that now is the right time to pass the baton. The turnaround is complete, we have delivered all the metrics we set ourselves."" The 54-year-old added: ""I am going to take some proper time out, recharge the batteries and think about what comes next."" Analysts at Shore Capital said he was ""the bloke that saved Tesco"". He took the helm at a tumultuous time for the supermarket group, announcing shortly after he took over in 2014 that the retailer had been overstating its profits. Jack: Tesco's Lewis inherited a badly-damaged business Tesco's new discount chain Jack's takes on Aldi and Lidl Tesco to cut 4,500 jobs across 153 Metro stores Tesco to buy Budgens and Londis brand owner Booker The company subsequently revealed a loss of Â£6.4bn,the biggest-ever suffered by a UK retailer Since then Mr Lewis has set about reducing costs, with the latest of round job cuts announced in August when it said 4,500 staff in 153 Tesco Metro stores would lose their roles. He also took on the discounters Aldi and Lidl by opening Jacks, Tesco's own discount chain. Mr Lewis also orchestrated Tesco's 2017 takeover of Booker, the biggest food wholesaler, in a Â£3.7bn deal to create the ""UK's leading food business"". Bernstein analyst Bruno Monteyne told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that there had been speculation about Mr Lewis' future after that deal as Booker's chief executive Charles Wilson had joined at the time. ""We're all trying to grapple exactly about the timing right now,"" said Mr Monteyne. His departure now was ""a total surprise"", he said. Mr Lewis had joined five years ago ""at a very difficult moment"" for Tesco, Mr Monteyne said. ""Not only had it lost the trust of the customers, losing material market to the discounters, it ended up with an accounting fraud... internal morale broken. He really took over a broken company, and from being the most profitable retailer in Europe, suddenly had losses for the first time ever."" As with comedy, timing is everything in big business. Many chief executives overstay their welcome, failing to realise that the clock is always ticking; the average tenure of a FTSE 350 chief executive is 4.5 years, and coming down. Dave Lewis, however, is clever enough to know that it's best to leave while the going is good. He joined Tesco when it was in disarray and at a time of some drama. There had been a string of profits warnings, a boardroom bust-up leading to the departure of the chief executive and a nasty accounting scandal. Mr Lewis moved quickly and the returns show in today's half-year results, which were rather overshadowed by Mr Lewis's departure. Sales were flat, but the operating margin hit 4%, a year before Mr Lewis said it would. That is an achievement but Mr Lewis will know that running Tesco will not get any easier. Keeping Tesco at that level of operating margin is going to be a long, hard slog. There will inevitably be speculation that he will return to Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch consumer goods giant where he worked before joining Tesco. The shares initially dipped but were trading nearly 2% higher at 243p as the results for the six months to 24 August were better than expected. Operating profit, excluding  one-off items, rose by 25% at Â£1.4bn. Like-for-like sales, which strip out revenue from new stores opened during the six months, rose 0.1% in the UK and Ireland. At a group level, including operations in central Europe, notably Poland, and Asia, same store sales fell 0.4%. Ken Murphy will have a Â£1.35m salary When Mr Lewis joined Tesco from household goods company Unilever he was the first outsider to run the supermarket chain. Speculation will turn to what he will do next, but Mr Lewis said: ""I'm going to step back and have a think about what I want to do next with my family. I'm 54 years old and I'm going to sit back and think where I can make the best contribution."" His successor, Mr Murphy, has also been hired from outside after a lengthy career with Boots, which is now part of  Walgreens Boots Alliance. The 52 year-old graduated from University College Cork and was educated at the Christian Brothers College. The Irishman left Walgreens Boots Alliance in January 2019 when his last role was chief commercial officer, president of global brands. He remains as a consultant. But he held a wide-range of roles, including a two year period as chief operating officer of Boots until October 2013. At Tesco, his salary will be Â£1.35m salary before bonuses, and his joining date has not yet been confirmed. ""We would imagine that Mr Lewis may have been familiar with his replacement from his Unilever personal care days,"" said analysts at Shore Capital. ""Mr Murphy has big shoes to fill."" They expect continuity for now but when Mr Murphy does take the helm he will face a number of challenges: Deciding whether Jacks is an effective way to take on Lidl and Aldi Assessing any long-term impact of Brexit on its supply chain Adapting to the changing shopping habits of consumers Considering the extent of the group's international business Mr Allen described Mr Murphy as ""growth-orientated seasoned business leader"" and said he had been  been looking for ""experience, proven leadership in international retail businesses, a strong strategic mind"" In preparation for Brexit, Tesco said it was increasing its stock of long-life shelf products and noted that the UK imports about 50% of fresh food it needs.

Thestudy commissioned by NHS Health Scotland,externalsuggests a drop in demand for some products was offset by increased prices. Researchers said retailers adapted to cope with price changes. Scotland was the world's first nation to require all licensed premises to set a minimum unit price (MUP) for alcohol. The policy was designed to increase the cost of cheap, high-strength drinks such as ciders and some spirits seen to cause the most harm. Minimum price 'cuts weekly drinking by half pint' New drink laws 'implemented effectively' Alcohol sales drop as minimum price kicks in In an initial assessment of the effects of MUP, researchers at Frontier Economics evaluated its economic impact on producers and alcohol retailers in the nine months following the introduction of the policy in April 2018. Many reported a decrease in alcohol sales was offset by increased prices and consumers switching to existing premium brands. It said no retailers or producers had reported reducing staff numbers or investment as a result of MUP. Andrew Leicester, manager at Frontier Economics, said: ""The respondents interviewed in this study suggested that demand changed in a number of ways in the first nine months following MUP coming into force, with sales of products that were previously retailing below the minimum unit price decreasing the most. ""Demand for smaller sizes, low-alcohol products or premium products less affected by price increases, has seen some producers and retailers adapt their strategy and product offering in response to MUP."" He emphasised the difficulties in evaluating the full impact of MUP when other factors had also affected the market, notably the 2018 football World Cup and the long, hot summer of that year. Examples of prices Â£14Whisky (70cl bottle at 40% ABV) Â£13.13Vodka (70cl bottle at 37.5% ABV) Â£1Lager (500ml can at 4% ABV) Â£2.50Cider (1 litre bottle at 5% - normal strength) Â£4.69Red wine (75cl bottle at 12.5% ABV) NHS Health Scotland commissioned the research as part of a wide-ranging evaluation of the Alcohol (Minimum Pricing) (Scotland) Act 2012 which established MUP It has a sunset clause which requires the Scottish Parliament to vote before 1st May 2024 on whether or not the policy will continue. Neil Craig, head of evaluation at NHS Health Scotland, said: ""NHS Health Scotland are leading a robust and comprehensive evaluation of Minimum Unit Pricing, which will provide a full understanding of what difference the legislation is making and to whom. ""That of course includes the impact MUP could make to levels of alcohol-related health and social harm, but also requires us to assess the effect on the alcoholic drinks industry in Scotland."" The researchers interviewed retailers on both sides of the Scotland-England border to see if MUP had led to an increase in people from Scotland buying alcohol from stores in England. But they said retailers noted cross-border purchasing was happening prior to the introduction of MUP, as many consumers who live near the border in Scotland work in Carlisle or Berwick-upon-Tweed, or conduct weekly grocery shopping in these towns. Alison Douglas, chief executive of Alcohol Focus Scotland said: ""It's encouraging to see further evidence that MUP has resulted in less alcohol being sold in Scotland and that this has been achieved without any negative impact on the alcohol industry. ""Even a small reduction in the amount of alcohol consumed in Scotland will bring big benefits for people's health."" The next findings from the MUP evaluation are to be published by early 2020 and include the effect of the policy on children and young people.

"This video can not be played Residents were trapped in their homes in the village of Laxey on the Isle of Man A clean-up operation is under way on the Isle of Man after severe flooding left people trapped in their homes. The village ofLaxey was cut off when the river burst its bankson Tuesday leaving several homes under 6ft (1.8m) of water. One resident said the flooding was ""an unmitigated disaster that could have been prevented"". Chief Minister Howard Quayle said an action plan was being drawn up to ""ensure it doesn't happen again"". Infrastructure minister Ray Harmer said the ""massive clear-up"" would continue in the village ""for the next day or so"". A major part of the works was removing trees and debris from the river to prevent more flooding in the immediate future. Many homes in Glen Road have been affected Extra sandbags were also delivered and skips provided for residents to dispose of flood-damaged flooring and furniture, he added. Although it was too early to say what long-term measures would be put in place, the government was taking ""a number of actions"", added Mr Harmer. Home affairs chief executive Dan Davies said debris was being removed from the river and roads and help was being offered to residents. ""It is really about supporting people to get back in their homes,"" he said. ""If they are vulnerable, health and social care will be on the scene helping people out."" The gap in the wall is being shored-up to prevent further flooding in the coming days Charlotte Morgan-Jones and her family were stranded in their home for several hours. The mother-of-two said the moment water surged through the village was ""scary"". ""It was literally like something you see in movies,"" she said. ""My husband was outside putting out sandbags, the next thing all I heard was shouting and screaming and the water was coming in the front door."" The clear-up is set to continue for some time John Wood said staff ""had to work hard"" to clear the flood water at Laxey Woollen Mills Debbie Corlett said the situation was ""surreal"" for residents At Laxey Woollen Mills, staff ""had to work hard to get it all cleared"", said master weaver John Wood. ""The flooring will need seeing to in a couple of weeks when it's all dried out a bit,"" he said. ""I'm sure there's going to be quite a lot of work, but it's nothing compared to what other people have."" Resident Debbie Corlett recalled the moment a second breach in the river wall was made to release the flood water back into the river, She said it was ""like a plug being pulled"". ""I could hear a big cheer up the road. It abated very, very quickly because it could get back into the river, which is where should have been in the first place,"" she said. ""It was all very surreal."" Mark and Tracey Young are back in their home in Laxey assessing the damage caused by the flood. ""It started raining earlyâ¦ [there was] a little bit of rain and then the wall just collapsed and it was like a tidal wave,"" said Mr Young. Mark Young (right) said the water was like a ""tidal wave"" Richard Kneen said he was ""lucky"" but added others had been ""devastated"" Some residents reacted angrily to the situation, including Richard Kneen who owns a property on Glen Road. He said work being carried out on the river was a ""totally unnecessary project"" and management at Manx Utilities should be held accountable. ""The whole thing was an unmitigated disaster down here that could have been prevented,"" he said. ""Heads should roll for this, there's millions of pounds worth of damage."" While he said he had been ""lucky"", Mr Kneen said others had been ""absolutely devastated"". Many properties suffered extensive damage to flooring and furniture Manx Utilities chairman Alex Allinson (right) was told of residents concerns Flooding occurred on Tuesday when the swollen River Laxey burst through a gap in a parallel wall which had been opened to repair a weir. More than 100mm (4in) of rain fell within a 20-hour period, with the heaviest downpour occurring in the early hours of Tuesday morning, said The Met Office. This ""very localised"" rain fell mostly on the northern side of the Snaefell Mountain, which drains into the Laxey River, a spokesman said. Manx Utilities chairman Alex Allinson apologised to those affected and said an ""urgent meeting"" had been called by Chief Minister Howard Quayle. He said a ""combination of factors"" were responsible including debris causing a build-up of water which led to a ""surge"", he said. The repair work had been due to be completed by the end of September but delays meant it had been extended for a week. He said a ""full analysis"" was under way. Chief Minister Howard Quayle (left) visited Laxey to speak to those affected Chief Minister Quayle, who visited the village and spoke to some of the residents affected, said the government would be examining all possible factors. ""We need to get to the bottom of what had caused the problem, fix it, and ensure it doesn't happen again. ""We'll be putting in place an action plan to make sure that the chances of this happening again are as remote as possible."" Meanwhile, members of a parliamentary scrutiny committee have written to the government asking for ""an urgent overview of events"" that unfolded in Laxey. Rob Callister said: ""We want to establish the facts. There are a lot of angry residents that need answers quickly."" Debris washed downstream is being removed from the river The Mountain Road reopened overnight but is currently closed to allow safety work, the Department for Infrastructure said. Laxey and Dhoon primary schools which were closed during the flooding have reopened as normal, the Isle of Man government said. It is the second time in four years the village of Laxey has been hit by flooding. In December 2015, heavy rain led to part of a road bridge over the river being washed away.

"This video can not be played Calf rescued from water pipe by farmer A three-week-old Aberdeen Angus calf has been saved following a major operation to rescue it from an underground water pipe. Farmer Robert Osborne and stockman Iain Robertson said they struggled for two-and-a-half hours to get the calf free. The alarm was raised on Tuesday after the Durisdeer farmer said he heard the animal making noises in the field. He said they were eventually able to locate and free the calf, nick-named Trouble, with the help of a digger. Mr Osborne said he had not initially believed it was possible for the calf to get into the pipe. ""When I did realise it was in, it sounded really close,"" he said. ""I thought it was not that far away but I got the torch and I couldn't see it."" The whole rescue operation was captured on film by his daughter Grace Tait Osborne. She told BBC Radio Scotland'sJohn Beattie programmehow the incident had unfolded. Mr Osborne said he had not initially thought it was possible for the calf to get stuck down the hole Mr Osborne's daughter captured the rescue operation on film Robert Osborne, right, and Iain Robertson struggled for hours to get the calf free ""I don't know why it went into the water pipe, it was obviously just exploring and got itself a wee bit stuck,"" she said. ""It's a pretty big calf, it had obviously gone in and it was unable to turn itself back round to come out. ""So it had kept walking straight down hoping to get out of the other end but it ended up just getting itself stuck deeper in the water pipe."" After hearing the animal's cries, Mr Osborne and Mr Robertson began digging holes to get better access to the distressed calf. Eventually, they used a box attached to a rope to help them drag the calf to safety. ""Two-and-a-half hours it took us,"" said Mr Osborne. ""It's not really about the value,"" he added. ""Farmers get bad enough press for looking after their animals, but 99.9% of farmers do look after their animals. ""It is a nice wee calf."" Miss Osborne said the animal appeared to be none the worse for its adventure. ""He is up in the shed with his mum now, they are both back together,"" she said. ""They have been taken out of the field and put in a shed for now just so they can keep a closer eye on the calf.""

"The RSC, based in Stratford-upon-Avon, said the decision had ""not been taken lightly"" The Royal Shakespeare Company is to end its partnership with BP at the end of the year following criticism of its links to the international oil giant. The RSC said it ""could not ignore"" the ""strength of feeling"" against the deal. Last week, school studentsthreatened to boycottthe theatre company if it did not sever links with the firm. ""Young people are now saying clearly to us that the BP sponsorship is putting a barrier between them and their wish to engage with the RSC,"" it said. BP has subsidised the Stratford-upon-Avon-based theatre company's Â£5 ticket scheme for 16 to 25-year-olds. Gregory Doran and Catherine Mallyon, the theatre company's artistic and executive directors, said the ""difficult"" decision had not been taken ""lightly or swiftly"". ""We would like to thank BP for their generous support of the RSC since 2011,"" they said. Sir Mark Rylance resigned as an RSC associate artist earlier this year In a statement, BP said it was ""disappointed and dismayed"" its partnership had been brought to a ""premature"" end. ""Over the past eight years our sponsorship has enabled 80,000 young people to see RSC performances at reduced rates,"" it continued. The company said it shared ""many of the concerns that apparently contributed to the decision"" and was committed to making energy ""cleaner and better"". ""The increasing polarisation of debate, and attempts to exclude companies committed to making real progress, is exactly what is not needed,"" it continued. Paapa Essiedu and Ewart James Walters starred in the RSC's Hamlet in 2016 Last week, a group of students said they would boycott RSC productions if it continued to accept funding from a company they accused of ""actively destroying our futures"". ""BP's influence is nothing but a stain on the RSC,"" they wrote in a letter. Earlier this year, Sir Mark Rylance, a long-standing critic of the sponsorship agreement,resigned from his postas an RSC associate artist. In his resignation letter, the Oscar-winning actor said he did not ""wish to be associated with BP any more than I would with an arms dealer [or] tobacco salesman"". Greenpeace UK said it was ""time other oil-sponsored institutions took note"". Morten Thaysen, climate campaigner at Greenpeace, said: ""Grassroots campaigns like BP Or Not BP and the youth strikers deserve this win... It's hard not to think the walls are closing in on BP."" BP spends Â£7.5 million per year on arts and culture sponsorship, which includes deals with the British Museum, the Royal Opera House and the National Portrait Gallery. It cut its sponsorship of theTate art galleries in 2016, but said the decision was not a result of protests by climate activists. Follow us onFacebook,external, or on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external.

More than 100mm (4in) of rain fell within a 20-hour period, with the heaviest downpour occurring in the early hours of Tuesday morning, said The Met Office. This ""very localised"" rain fell mostly on the northern side of the Snaefell Mountain, which drains into the Laxey River, a spokesman said. Manx Utilities chairman Alex Allinson apologised to those affected and said an ""urgent meeting"" had been called by Chief Minister Howard Quayle. He said a ""combination of factors"" were responsible including debris causing a build-up of water which led to a ""surge"", he said. The repair work had been due to be completed by the end of September but delays meant it had been extended for a week. He said a ""full analysis"" was under way. Chief Minister Howard Quayle (left) visited Laxey to speak to those affected Chief Minister Quayle, who visited the village and spoke to some of the residents affected, said the government would be examining all possible factors. ""We need to get to the bottom of what had caused the problem, fix it, and ensure it doesn't happen again. ""We'll be putting in place an action plan to make sure that the chances of this happening again are as remote as possible."" Meanwhile, members of a parliamentary scrutiny committee have written to the government asking for ""an urgent overview of events"" that unfolded in Laxey. Rob Callister said: ""We want to establish the facts. There are a lot of angry residents that need answers quickly."" Debris washed downstream is being removed from the river The Mountain Road reopened overnight but is currently closed to allow safety work, the Department for Infrastructure said. Laxey and Dhoon primary schools which were closed during the flooding have reopened as normal, the Isle of Man government said. It is the second time in four years the village of Laxey has been hit by flooding. In December 2015, heavy rain led to part of a road bridge over the river being washed away.

"The government publishes its Brexit proposals, including plans to replace Irish backstop The plan would see Northern Ireland essentially stay in the European single market for goods, but leave the EU customs union with the rest of the UK This would mean new customs checks between NI and the Irish Republic The Northern Ireland Assembly would have a say over border arrangements The European Commission welcomes progress on regulatory alignment of goods - but still has concerns Addressing the Tory party conference, Mr Johnson says the only alternative to his plan is no deal The government confirms it plans to prorogue Parliament again on Tuesday - ahead of a Queens Speech on October 14 Marie Jackson, Hazel Shearing, Kate Whannel and Martha Buckley Boris Johnson after finishing his conference speech It's been one of those days in the long Brexit process which potentially feels momentous but we probably won't know how momentous until further down the line. Here's a recap of today's events.  The European Parliament's initial response to the UK's proposals is ""not positive"", says its Brexit coordinator Guy Verhofstadt. Emerging from a briefing with the EUâs chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier, he adds a written response will be produced tomorrow. Boris Johnson and his Irish counterpart Leo Varadkar have spoken over the phone this evening. Mr Varadkar, whose support is crucial for any hope of a wider UK-EU agreement, has issued a short statement in response. He suggested the UK's proposals ""do not fully meet the agreed objectives of the backstop"". In other words, they do not go far enough in upholding the integrity of the EU's single market and protecting the peace settlement in Northern Ireland. But he reiterated that he wanted an agreement and he would consult with the European Commission and other member states in the coming days. He said he expected to speak to Mr Johnson again early next week. Laura KuenssbergBBC political editor Seventy days into Boris Johnson's time in office we now know how he wants to change Theresa May's deal with the European Union. What we don't know, and he doesn't know, is whether his counterparts on the continent have the faintest intention of letting him do so. At the highest levels of government there is a belief that senior figures in the EU, even in Dublin, were certainly willing to contemplatea set of plans,externallike this. But those polite promises to consider became less firm when MPs voted to make it much harder to leave without a deal. Read Laura's full bloghere. BBC News Channel Boris Johnson's proposal moves us into ""completely uncharted territory"" when it comes to customs, says customs consultant Dr Anna Jerzewska ""Both in terms of having two borders and splitting the border functions between a customs border and a regulatory border, and having two instead of one, as well as what's going to happen to Northern Ireland in general,"" she explains. ""The last element of this is that none of it is currently possible under the  EU customs legislation."" She adds: ""One of the commitments that the UK has made is no hard border in Ireland. In terms of customs procedure, this proposal is a hard border."" Sky News political correspondent tweets... Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Conservative MPs have been arriving for a meeting with the
prime minister in Downing Street tonight. Former Conservative Party leader Iain Duncan Smith told
reporters that he had not yet seen Boris Johnsonâs proposals for a Brexit deal,
while Bernard Jenkin said there were âstill problems - I am going in now to
see if the problems still existâ. Others seen arriving â all members of the pro-Brexit ERG
group - were Steve Baker, Marcus Fyshe, Craig Mackinlay, John Redwood, Owen
Paterson and Bill Cash The prime ministerâs chief adviser Dominic Cummings was also
seen arriving in Downing Street but refused to speak to reporters. Chris MorrisBBC Reality Check Michel Barnier's reaction was cautious, to put it mildly. Two of the key words in his response: whatever replaces the backstop has to be ""legally operative"". In other words: not a broad plan which we can then sort out over the next couple of years. That is something the UK government has suggested - maybe we can use a transition period to iron out the details. The EU has said from the start: ""No, that's not what we agreed previously, it has to be a legally operative solution when you leave."" The chances of that happening between now and the end of October - even the middle of October at that EU summit - are just very, very slim. It's an incredibly tall order because these are technical issues, difficult issues, which take time to negotiate. Downing Street has released a statement confirming its intention to seek to prorogue Parliament on Tuesday 8 October with a Queenâs Speech on Monday 14 October. ""These
timings would mean Parliament is prorogued for the shortest time possible to
enable all the necessary logistical preparations for a State Opening to be
undertaken,"" the statement says. Downing
Street has confirmed that the prime minister this evening has spoken with
German Chancellor Angela Merkel, President of the European Commission
Jean-Claude Juncker and Irish Taoiseach Leo
Varadkar to discuss the plan which the UK government put forward
today for a new protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland. The Number 10 spokesman said the prime minister would hold further conversations with
counterparts in coming days. Leader of the SDLP Colum Eastwood has given his reaction to the prime minister's plan. ""This is no compromise proposal,"" he says, adding the government's offer was ""unacceptable to  business, border communities and a majority of MLAs [members of the legislative assembly]"". ""This is a proposal from a government that doesn't understand the complexities of this island, but more to the point they don't care,"" he says. ""The brass neck of the DUP should come as no surprise. ""They honestly think people are idiots."" Independent MP tweets... Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Nick Boles was a Conservative MP until he resigned the whip, accusing his party of refusing to ""compromise"" over Brexit. BBC News Channel âWe will continue to work to reach a
deal. No-deal will never be choice of EU - never,"" says Michel
Barnier, Chief EU Brexit negotiator. ""So we will continue to reach
a deal and work with the UK team, but a deal which respects the three commitments of the backstop in the legal operative manner and respecting the
mandate given to the Commission by the European Parliament.â He says the three objectives of the backstop are ""no border"", the ""all-Ireland economy"" and ""protecting the single market"". The latter, he says, means ""protecting the consumers, the citizens and the businesses inside the single market, the 27 member states"". Nick EardleyBBC political correspondent The Government intends to prorogue Parliament next Tuesday â
and holda Queenâs Speechon
Monday the 14th. In its
judgement earlier this month, the Supreme Court ruled the last attempt unlawful,
but left open the prospect of shorter prorogation. Ministers
have repeatedly said the current session of Parliament must end so that the
government can introduce a raft of new domestic legislation. To that end,
it intends to send MPs home on Tuesday â and hold the Queenâs Speech on the
original planned date â the
14th of October. Number 10 had been studying the implications of the Supreme Court judgement â
and will hope a shorter suspension of a few days rather than five weeks causes
it less trouble. It also avoids another
potentially awkward conversation with the Palace about rescheduling the Queenâs
plans. Already, however, opposition parties have raised concerns. A source
told the BBC Boris Johnson was trying to avoid prime ministerâs questions and
parliamentary scrutiny.  John CampbellBBC News NI Economics and Business Editor What was the backstop? How does Boris Johnson's plan differ on customs? And will the Irish government go for it? BBC News NI's economic and business editor, John Campbell,answers your questions. BBC News Channel Tony Blair's former chief of staff, Jonathan Powell, says the government's plan is ""not a serious negotiating position"". ""It is part of a political game to put the blame of failure on the EU,"" he says. ""If it was a serious proposal it wouldn't propose a hard border in Northern Ireland. ""There is no way this a serious proposition - those of us who thought they [the government] didn't want a deal are correct."" Chair of the Commons Brexit Committee Hilary Benn says Boris Johnson's plan would require customs checks on the island of Ireland. He says that is ""very hard"" to reconcile with the government's earlier committments. ""We know that any checks are going to create a difficulty given the delicacy of the peace process in Northern Ireland,"" he adds. Speaking in Belfast, DUP leader Arlene Foster says: ""We will be supporting this plan."" âIt allows us to leave the customs union, it allows us to
leave the single market, then we opt in if weâre not in the position to put in
place alternative arrangements at that time, so therefore we consent to
whatever is coming forward,"" she says. ""Thatâs a big difference and something that works
for Northern Ireland whilst letting us leave the European Unionâ. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,0.96186143
"This video can not be played Nigel Farage was hit with a milkshake while campaigning in Newcastle A Burger King tweet alerting customers it was ""selling milkshakes all weekend"" has been banned for condoning and encouraging anti-social behaviour. The fast food firm's post came after a number of European election candidates had milkshakes thrown at them. And a McDonald's in Edinburgh stopped selling the drinks before Nigel Farage addressed a rally in the city. Burger King defended the tweet, calling it a ""tongue-in-cheek reaction to recent events"". Ice cream ban near Farage campaign rally Milkshake thrown at Nigel Farage It read: ""Dear people of Scotland. We're selling milkshakes all weekend. Have fun. Love BK. #justsaying"". The Advertising Standards Agency (ASA) said it considered the tweet ""irresponsible"". The post on Burger King's official Twitter account followed a number of dairy-based incidents involving campaigners on the European election trail. Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, who is known as Tommy Robinson, and UKIP candidate Carl Benjamin were both hit with food and drink during the build-up to the poll. UKIP candidate in milkshake melee Milkshake thrown over Tommy Robinson Former English Defence League leader Mr Yaxley-Lennon was drenched with milkshakes twice in two days as he campaigned in the north-west of England. Days after his appearance at a Brexit Party rally in Edinburgh, Mr Farage was also later doused with milkshake during a campaign walkabout in Newcastle. The ASA was critical of Burger King's tweet for condoning and encouraging anti-social behaviour. It said 24 people complained that it was irresponsible and offensive because they believed it encouraged violence and anti-social behaviour. The tweet was posted the day after a McDonald's outlet in Edinburgh put up a sign to say that it would not be selling milkshakes or ice cream by ""police request"". Burger King said it did not endorse violence, which it made clear with a follow-up tweet reading: ""We'd never endorse violence - or wasting our delicious milkshakes! So enjoy the weekend and please drink responsibly people."" Dairy items were temporarily withdrawn from sale at an Edinburgh McDonald's during Nigel Farage's visit The ASA said: ""Although we acknowledged that the tweet may have been intended as a humorous response to the suspension of milkshake sales by the advertiser's competitor, in the context in which it appeared we considered it would be understood as suggesting that Burger King milkshakes could be used instead by people to 'milkshake' Nigel Farage. ""We considered the ad therefore condoned the previous anti-social behaviour and encouraged further instances. We therefore concluded that the ad was irresponsible."" The ASA added: ""We told Burger King to ensure that its future marketing communications did not condone or encourage anti-social behaviour."" A Burger King spokesman said: ""Our tweet regarding the situation in Edinburgh was intended to be a tongue-in-cheek reaction to the situation. It appears some have misinterpreted this as an endorsement of violence, which we absolutely reject. ""At Burger King, we totally believe in individuals' right to freedom of expression and would never do anything that conflicts with this. We'd never endorse violence or wasting our delicious milkshakes.""

"Travellers are beginning to turn their backs on air travel over concern for the environment, according to a survey by Swiss bank UBS. The Swedish concept of ""flygskam"" or ""flight shame"" appears to be spreading. One in five of the people surveyed had cut the number of flights they took over the last year because of the impact on the climate. UBS said the expected growth in passenger numbers could be halved if these trends were borne out. Global air travel has grown by between 4% and 5% a year, UBS said, meaning the overall numbers are doubling every 15 years. What is flygskam? Greta speaks up about 'flight-shaming' Why âflight shameâ is making people swap planes for trains Industry forecasts from plane makers Airbus and Boeing predict growth will continue at that rate until 2035. But the UBS survey suggests that high-profile campaigns - like the example set by Swedish school girl Greta Thunberg, which has helped push the climate crisis up the political agenda - could trigger a change in flying habits in wealthier parts of the world, particularly in the US and Europe. After surveying more than 6,000 people in the US, Germany, France and the UK, UBS found that 21% had reduced the number of flights they took over the last year. Nathan Molyneaux is now looking to travel more by railway Nathan Molyneaux, from Leeds, moved to Aarhus in Denmark for work, and since then the number of flights he has taken have increased. ""I moved out here two and a half years ago and flights have ballooned a bit as I have friends in the UK,"" says the 38-year-old senior sales planner. ""I am flying a lot more than usual and I need to reduce that for the good of the environment - the challenge is to try and not fly at all."" As an extreme example of his new regime, the keen runner plans an overland trip from his home on Denmark's east coast to Barcelona for a half-marathon next February. ""I will take a train from Aarhus to Cologne in Germany, and spend the night there.  I will then take two TGV high-speed trains through France and Spain,"" he says. ""It will be a long journey but that is part of the fun - about 24 hours of travel but I should get to see some beautiful countryside."" He estimates that moving from aircraft to trains as his main mode of travel will be about 20% more expensive, but says his trip to Catalonia will only cost â¬40 (Â£36) more. Mr Molyneaux says there has been a lack of investment in Danish railways in recent years, but that appears to now be changing. He is also disappointed about the reduction in ferry services between the north of England and mainland Europe, with a number of routes axed in recent years. Only 16% of British respondents said they were cutting back on flying, but 24% of US travellers were worried enough to change their flying habits. The survey was first conducted in May this year and UBS said there had been a marked change since then. The bank now expects the number of flights in the EU will increase by just 1.5% per year, which is half the rate expected by plane maker Airbus. The bank forecasted that growth in US flights would fall from the 2.1% expected to just 1.3%. And that could have a big impact on aircraft manufacturers. UBS estimates it could reduce the number of smaller planes ordered from Airbus and rival Boeing by 110 each year. The bank said that would reduce revenues at Airbus, which controls around 57% of the market, by around â¬2.8bn (Â£2.5bn) a year. Are you planning to fly less to help combat climate change?

"This video can not be played Footage of the shooting shows the police officer fire one bullet at close range The 70th anniversary of Communist Party rule in China was ""one of Hong Kong's most violent and chaotic days"", the city's police chief has said. An 18-year-old protester was shot in the chest with a live bullet - one of six live rounds fired by police. Protesters - some armed with poles, petrol bombs and other projectiles - fought pitched battles with police in several parts of Hong Kong. In all police made 269 arrests, more than on any day since protests began. Those detained ranged in age from 12 to 71. More than 100 people were taken to hospital and 30 police were injured. Tuesday's unrest saw police fire 900 rubber bullets and 1,400 rounds of tear gas. That compares with 1,000 tear gas canisters fired in the first two months of protests. In the days leading up to the anniversary, tensions were high in Hong Kong, which always sees protests on National Day. This year, however, Hong Kong has seen four months of protests sparked by proposed changes to an extradition bill. Though the changes have been abandoned, the unrest has continued, expanding into demands for greater democracy. Students at Tsuen Wan Public Ho Chuen Yiu Memorial College show solidarity with the protester who was shot The shooting of Tsang Chi-kin, who was attacking an officer with a pole, was captured on video and shared online. ""My chest is hurting, I need to go to hospital,"" said the 18-year-old, who was arrested after being shot. The government said he was now in a stable condition. Although people have been shot with rubber bullets in previous protests, this was the first injury from a live round. Police chief Stephen Lo said firing the bullet was ""lawful and reasonable"" as the officer thought his and colleagues' lives were under threat. Asked why the bullet was fired at close range, Mr Lo said: ""He [the officer] did not decide the distance between him and the assailant."" As it happened: Hong Kong protests In pictures: China shows off military might Hundreds of people staged a peaceful sit-in outside the teenager's school on Wednesday. Meanwhile, 96 people, mostly students, who had been arrested on Sunday appeared in court charged with rioting. Repairs to shops, businesses and public facilities - including the mass transit system - are under way following Tuesday's violence. All metro stations are now open. In Beijing, the anniversary of Communist Party rule saw a parade ofChinese military might: 15,000 troops, 580 vehicles and missiles, and 160 aircraft. In Hong Kong, some 1,200 miles away, protesters marked the day very differently. Peaceful marches soon exploded into violence. BBC reporter Tessa Wong, who was on the streets, said protesters fought ""pitched battles"" with officers. Shortly before Tsang Chi-kin was shot, men wearing helmets and gas masks attacked an officer on the ground with a pole. An officer responded by firing his gun at close range. Elsewhere, protesters threw petrol bombs, started fires, and ran at officers. Police responded with water cannon, tear gas, and - in total - six live rounds. The day saw the highest number of arrests since this year's protests began, and the highest number of live rounds fired. A woman at West Kowloon Law Courts on Wednesday, before 96 anti-government protesters arrested on Sunday were due to appear The protests were sparked earlier this year by a proposed law, which would have allowed extradition from Hong Kong to the Chinese mainland. Opponents thought this would put Hong Kongers at risk of unfair trials, and,in July, Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said the law ""was dead"". But despite the law being withdrawn, the protests have continued every weekend. Clashes between police and protesters have created their own momentum, and there is wider discontent too. âI donât have any hope for my future in Hong Kongâ The twists and turns before the bill was withdrawn Recent years have seen growing opposition to the perceived encroachment of Beijing on Hong Kong's politics and threats to local identity. Many young people haveeconomic worries,and there are also demands foruniversal suffragefor elections to Hong Kong's parliament. As China showed off its superpower status in Beijing, violence in Hong Kong - a special administrative region of China - was inevitable. Until 1997, Hong Kong was a British territory. Since then, it has been part of China but with its own system of law and government - known as One Country, Two Systems. Hong Kong has its own judiciary and a separate legal system. Rights including freedom of assembly and freedom of speech are protected. But those freedoms - the Basic Law - expire in 2047. It is not clear what Hong Kong's status will be then.

The storm -the most powerful hurricane ever recordedin the far east Atlantic - will have lost most of its power by the time it arrives on Thursday. It comes after torrential rain brought flash flooding and led to some places being evacuated on Tuesday. On the Isle of Man amajor incident was declaredwith people trapped indoors. Elsewhere, some areas in the Midlands, Wales and southern England were hit by a week's rain in just an hour, as thunderstorms swept across the UK. Roads and railways were closed and some flights from London's Heathrow Airport were delayed on Tuesday evening due to the bad weather. Dozens of flood warnings and alertsremain in place,externalacross England. Major incident as people trapped by flooding Hurricane Lorenzo breaks record in mid-Atlantic How do hurricanes form? Louise Lear, from BBC Weather, said temperatures would turn colder on Wednesday before an area of low pressure - carrying gale-force gusts and the remnants of former Hurricane Lorenzo - approached Northern Ireland on Thursday. The low pressure would move eastwards and south during Thursday and into Friday, bringing ""a spell of wet and windy weather"", she said. Thursday and Friday will see wind and rain hit western parts of the UK, BBC Weather said The Met Office said Northern Ireland, western Scotland, Wales and south-west England will most likely be affected. On Tuesday, the Met Office issued issued a yellow warning for heavy rain across large parts of central and southern England and Wales. On the Isle of Man,the village of Laxey was cut offafter its second major flood in four years. The river that gave the village its name burst its banks, leaving people trapped in their homes and washing away cars. The fire service helped to evacuate several houses, while a coastguard helicopter was flown in on standby. The village was previously flooded in 2015, when a 200-year-old stone bridge was washed away. One villager told the BBC that this year's flooding was the worst he had seen. Local residents make their way through floodwater in Cossington, Leicester Also in Cossington, a clean-up operation is under way at a flooded home Flights from Heathrow were delayed on Tuesday evening because of ""poor weather conditions across London and the South East"", a spokeswoman for the airport said. And the Thames Barrier closed for the second time in a week to protect London from flooding.

By Tuesday afternoon, the highest hourly rainfall was 25.6mm, recorded at Pennerley in Shropshire. That part of the country normally receives just 96mm of rain in the whole of October. But the localised nature of the downpours means the heaviest rainfall may not be recorded by a weather station, the Met Office said. Worcestershire was one place that experienced torrential rainfall, with the fire and rescue service issuing a warning to drivers after a car was submerged in floods. Allow Twitter content?

"This video can not be played Residents were trapped in their homes in the village of Laxey on the Isle of Man A clean-up operation is under way on the Isle of Man after severe flooding left people trapped in their homes. The village ofLaxey was cut off when the river burst its bankson Tuesday leaving several homes under 6ft (1.8m) of water. One resident said the flooding was ""an unmitigated disaster that could have been prevented"". Chief Minister Howard Quayle said an action plan was being drawn up to ""ensure it doesn't happen again"". Infrastructure minister Ray Harmer said the ""massive clear-up"" would continue in the village ""for the next day or so"". A major part of the works was removing trees and debris from the river to prevent more flooding in the immediate future. Many homes in Glen Road have been affected Extra sandbags were also delivered and skips provided for residents to dispose of flood-damaged flooring and furniture, he added. Although it was too early to say what long-term measures would be put in place, the government was taking ""a number of actions"", added Mr Harmer. Home affairs chief executive Dan Davies said debris was being removed from the river and roads and help was being offered to residents. ""It is really about supporting people to get back in their homes,"" he said. ""If they are vulnerable, health and social care will be on the scene helping people out."" The gap in the wall is being shored-up to prevent further flooding in the coming days Charlotte Morgan-Jones and her family were stranded in their home for several hours. The mother-of-two said the moment water surged through the village was ""scary"". ""It was literally like something you see in movies,"" she said. ""My husband was outside putting out sandbags, the next thing all I heard was shouting and screaming and the water was coming in the front door."" The clear-up is set to continue for some time John Wood said staff ""had to work hard"" to clear the flood water at Laxey Woollen Mills Debbie Corlett said the situation was ""surreal"" for residents At Laxey Woollen Mills, staff ""had to work hard to get it all cleared"", said master weaver John Wood. ""The flooring will need seeing to in a couple of weeks when it's all dried out a bit,"" he said. ""I'm sure there's going to be quite a lot of work, but it's nothing compared to what other people have."" Resident Debbie Corlett recalled the moment a second breach in the river wall was made to release the flood water back into the river, She said it was ""like a plug being pulled"". ""I could hear a big cheer up the road. It abated very, very quickly because it could get back into the river, which is where should have been in the first place,"" she said. ""It was all very surreal."" Mark and Tracey Young are back in their home in Laxey assessing the damage caused by the flood. ""It started raining earlyâ¦ [there was] a little bit of rain and then the wall just collapsed and it was like a tidal wave,"" said Mr Young. Mark Young (right) said the water was like a ""tidal wave"" Richard Kneen said he was ""lucky"" but added others had been ""devastated"" Some residents reacted angrily to the situation, including Richard Kneen who owns a property on Glen Road. He said work being carried out on the river was a ""totally unnecessary project"" and management at Manx Utilities should be held accountable. ""The whole thing was an unmitigated disaster down here that could have been prevented,"" he said. ""Heads should roll for this, there's millions of pounds worth of damage."" While he said he had been ""lucky"", Mr Kneen said others had been ""absolutely devastated"". Many properties suffered extensive damage to flooring and furniture Manx Utilities chairman Alex Allinson (right) was told of residents concerns Flooding occurred on Tuesday when the swollen River Laxey burst through a gap in a parallel wall which had been opened to repair a weir. More than 100mm (4in) of rain fell within a 20-hour period, with the heaviest downpour occurring in the early hours of Tuesday morning, said The Met Office. This ""very localised"" rain fell mostly on the northern side of the Snaefell Mountain, which drains into the Laxey River, a spokesman said. Manx Utilities chairman Alex Allinson apologised to those affected and said an ""urgent meeting"" had been called by Chief Minister Howard Quayle. He said a ""combination of factors"" were responsible including debris causing a build-up of water which led to a ""surge"", he said. The repair work had been due to be completed by the end of September but delays meant it had been extended for a week. He said a ""full analysis"" was under way. Chief Minister Howard Quayle (left) visited Laxey to speak to those affected Chief Minister Quayle, who visited the village and spoke to some of the residents affected, said the government would be examining all possible factors. ""We need to get to the bottom of what had caused the problem, fix it, and ensure it doesn't happen again. ""We'll be putting in place an action plan to make sure that the chances of this happening again are as remote as possible."" Meanwhile, members of a parliamentary scrutiny committee have written to the government asking for ""an urgent overview of events"" that unfolded in Laxey. Rob Callister said: ""We want to establish the facts. There are a lot of angry residents that need answers quickly."" Debris washed downstream is being removed from the river The Mountain Road reopened overnight but is currently closed to allow safety work, the Department for Infrastructure said. Laxey and Dhoon primary schools which were closed during the flooding have reopened as normal, the Isle of Man government said. It is the second time in four years the village of Laxey has been hit by flooding. In December 2015, heavy rain led to part of a road bridge over the river being washed away.

"Jonty Bravery was 17 years old when he was charged A teenager accused of attempting to murder a boy by throwing him from a balcony at the Tate Modern can be named after reporting restrictions expired. Jonty Bravery, from west London, was 17 when he was charged in August and could not be named until his 18th birthday. The victim, a six-year-old French national who still cannot be named, suffered a ""deep"" bleed to the brain and fractured his spine. Mr Bravery is due to appear at a plea hearing next month. During a hearing at the Old Bailey on Tuesday, Judge Nicholas Hilliard QC, Recorder of London, turned down an application for a court order that would have prevented him being named after he turned 18. No further details from the hearing can be disclosed. Jonty Bravery has appeared in court charged with attempted murder The six-year-old, who was visiting London with his family, fell five floors from a 10th floor viewing platform on 4 August. In a statement released this week, his family said he ""keeps on smiling and making progress bravely"", but struggled ""to speak, to eat or to move his body"". ""We see his efforts. We believe with all our heart that he will find the way, from his head, to do everything again,"" they said. ""He is very brave. He keeps on smiling and reacting to our jokes.""

"This video can not be played Emily Hoskins was desperately ill because of her anorexia People with eating disorders are being told they are ""not ill enough"" for treatment, according to an expert. In a report, Jacinta Tan found support services were ""significantly under-resourced"". She called for investment to ensure eating disorders were identified early to stop people becoming severely ill. Health Minister Vaughan Gething said he would make sure services were ""shaped by the recommendations"". Dr Tan's review was completed in November but only published by the Welsh Government last week. It said a ""major reconfiguration"" of services was needed. And it found there was ""patchy provision"" of treatment across Wales. Little Mix's Jade Thirlwall on anorexia: 'How I recovered from an eating disorder' Anorexia stems from body as well as mind - study Autism-anorexia link 'must be acted on' Dr Tan, a consultant psychiatrist with the Aneurin Bevan University Health Board told Wales Live: ""The message that most of the patients say that they hear is they are not ill enough to deserve treatment from an eating disorder clinician, and that is absolutely unacceptable, not least because we have more and more research that tells us that the longer patients go without good expert treatment, the harder it's going to be for them to get better."" She said there was a ""strong case for significant investment"" and called for: more specialist clinicians a simpler referral process three new centres in Wales with outpatient facilities waiting time targets of a week in urgent cases and four weeks for others GP training to improve recognition, assessment and treatment acceptance of ""self-referrals"" so GPs need not be involved The review did not recommend a specialist in-patient unit be established in Wales, but said that should be reviewed in five years. Jacinta Tan's report found ""patchy provision"" across Wales Dr Tan estimated her recommendations would cost more than Â£9m and involve a significant staffing increase. Mr Gething said he would ensure services were ""shaped by the recommendations"". He has written to health boards asking them for their views on the recommendations. Emily Hoskins: ""I could have been days away from dying"" Emily Hoskins was diagnosed with anorexia at 13 and missed years of school. Now 22, she feels there needed to be better local access to eating disorder therapies and more support for families. She said anorexia left her so unwell she was ""not seeing the outdoors."" She was either in hospital or resting at home. Ms Hoskins, from Abertillery in Blaenau Gwent, said: ""I was completely drained, my skin was frail, my hair was falling out, I was just pale, gaunt, my nails were all a funny colour from where my body wasn't getting the nutrition it needed and then the mental side of it meant that I wasn't playing games, going out with my family."" She could not focus on anything but the disorder. ""I could have been days away from dying,"" Emily said. Specialist units in Bridgend and Wiltshire looked after her. She said she ""can't even describe"" how hard it was to be away from home. ""Wherever you live in Wales obviously there's differently-populated areas and different counties, but I think one thing I put to the review was that everyone should be treated equally, that we're all struggling with the same sort of illness and the support should be there for everyone. ""You shouldn't have to be offered one thing in one place, and then five minutes down the road, somebody else is offered something completely different"". In his letter Mr Gething asked health boards to ""reconfigure services towards earlier intervention"" and to develop plans for meeting the four-week waiting time target. Formal national targets will not be imposed ""at this stage"". Health boards have been given Â£700,000 to make improvements this year, and further annual funding of about Â£1m will be allocated from next year. Last month, several people with eating disorders, campaigners and politicians wrote to Mr Gething describing ""deep concern"" at the lack of action since the report's completion. Dr Tan said the wait had been ""frustrating"" but described the government's response as ""positive"" and ""supportive"". Bethan Sayed said the wait for the government's response had been ""unacceptably lengthy"" Bethan Sayed, chair of the assembly's eating disorders group, said the wait for a government response had been ""unacceptably lengthy"" and called for ""more clarity on funding"". A Welsh Government spokesman said the review required ""detailed analysis"". ""We have set out the actions we expect to be taken in the short term and will continue to work with health boards, clinicians and patients to ensure that services in Wales move towards the vision set out in the review.""

"Communities will be able to request a free-to-use ATM for their area if they are finding it hard to access cash. Link, which oversees the UK's network of cash machines, has set up a Â£1m fund to pay for ATMs in so-called cash deserts, although this will only fund 40 to 50 machines. It said more money could be added to the fund if the service proved popular. Criteria for successful bids include a lack of nearby ATMs, a safe location being found, and no Post Office access. Cash or no cash - where do you stand? Pay by cash? Not for long, report warns A report published this week by banking trade body UK Finance said that there were 52,358 free-to-use machines operating in the UK at the end of 2018. Another 11,002 pay-to-use machines were also in place. A total of 2.4 billion withdrawals were made from these machines last year, with Â£193bn of cash being taken out. The number of withdrawals from ATMs dwarf the alternative ways that consumers can access cash, such as debit card cashback (150 million withdrawals in 2018) and over the counter withdrawals (55 million in 2018). Consumer groups and campaigners have raised concerns about the falling number of cash machines in the UK. Consumer association Which? recently revealed that free-to-use cash machines weredisappearing quicker in deprived areas than in affluent ones. The organisation and Natalie Ceeney, who compiled an independent report onAccess to Cash,external, are calling on Chancellor Sajid Javid to guarantee people can get hold of cash if they need it. It called for an independent body, funded by the banks, to be set up that would step in if local communities were running short of access to cash in shops and ATMs. The new scheme, set up by Link, does not go that far, but does allow communities - individually, or through their MP or council - to request help directly from Link to fund new cash machines. The Link fund is financed by its bank and building society members. Applications are being taken now, although 11 sites have already been identified for directly installed ATMs. They are: Deal, Ebbw Vale, Margate, Middleton, Wilmslow and York, as well as pilot sites in Battle, Bungay, Nuneaton, Tywyn, and Durness. Battle, in East Sussex, was successful as tourists travelling to the area on a Sunday to visit the Battle of Hastings sites were unable to access cash, as the local Post Office is closed on that day each week. Each application for a similar ATM would need to satisfy criteria such as whether a retailer or council can find a safe location to host the machine. If there is another free-to-use ATM within 1km in the community and no particular geographical challenges to reaching it, applications may be unlikely to be successful. John Howells, chief executive of Link, said: ""[We are] looking forward to getting the first requests for ATMs so we can help solve access to cash issues across the whole UK."" Peter McNamara, chief executive of independent ATM operator NoteMachine, said the Link fund was ""a tiny bandage on a massive wound"", saying that the new ATMs would not make much difference when thousands had been shut. He said that Link had forced two cuts in the fees that banks pay the operators each time their customers use a non-bank machine. As a result, he argued, many cash machines had become uneconomic and were being taken out or switched from free-to-use to charging consumers. Branch closures had also led to ATMs being lost, he said. But the Federation for Small Businesses (FSB) described the new fund as a ""promising step in the right direction"". ""When an ATM is removed from a local area, we know it is especially difficult to get one reinstalled later on, and we hope this move can help,"" said FSB national chairman Mike Cherry. Link said it was also supporting a scheme, run by UK Finance and run across the UK banking and finance industry, aimed at finding ways that communities can access cash or be guided in the use other methods of paying for goods and services.

"The proposals could mean customs sites created on both sides of the border Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Leo Varadkar has said the Republic is ""not going to allow ourselves to be dragged out of the single market"". Speaking in the DÃ¡il, he also welcomed Prime Minister Boris Johnson's rejection of a proposal for custom sites near to the border. The taoiseach said the UK government should not ""impose"" customs checks ""against the will of the people"". He was echoing calls made by Irish deputy prime minister Simon Coveney. Johnson rejects leaks over Irish border plan UK to reveal detailed plan for Brexit negotiations Can a no-deal Brexit still happen? Boris Johnson and the border blocking Brexit Responding to a question from People Before Profit TD Richard Boyd Barrett, Mr Varadkar said the Republic would not be left in the ""worst of all worlds"" but not introducing border checks in the event of a no-deal Brexit. The taoiseach has said the Republic will not be ""dragged out"" of the single market He said not doing so could mean Irish businesses ""facing checks in Rotterdam, and in Zeebrugge, and in Calais"". ""We certainly can't allow ourselves out of belligerence to end up in a situation whereby we are surrounded by a border on all sides, and that is certainly not a situation we want to be in,"" he said. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. On Monday night,Irish national broadcaster RTÃ,externalsaid the UK suggested 'customs clearance zones' on both sides of the Irish border could replace the backstop. However, on Tuesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnsondenied tabling that proposal. But, in a separate interview, he accepted that some kind of customs checks would be necessary. Proposals for reaching a Brexit deal had been expected ahead of a crucial EU summit on 17 October. The BBC understands that any further customs inspections would be very limited. Political correspondent Iain Watson said they could be conducted either at new locations or at existing business premises. This video can not be played Would you notice if you crossed the Irish border? (Video from 2017) The proposals would mean posts created on both sides of the border, potentially five to 10 miles back from the land frontier. RTÃ said consignments would be checked and cleared at the sites, with data being provided to the customs authorities on both sides of the border. Goods moving from a customs clearance site on the northern side of the border to a similar site on the southern side would be monitored in real time using GPS via mobile phone data or tracking devices placed on trucks or vans. In the Lords on Tuesday, former Police Ombudsman Baroness Nuala O'Loan said the risk of attack on any physical infrastructure was very high. She told the chamber dissident republicans are very active, while recent comments from the UVF indicate they could enter into violence if the situation deteriorates. The ideas are believed to be contained in one of four so-called non-papers submitted by UK officials during recent technical discussions in Brussels. In a tweet, TÃ¡naiste (Ireland's deputy prime minister) Simon Coveney said the proposals were a ""non-starter"", adding Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland ""deserve better"". A spokesman for the Irish government said: ""The EU Task force has indicated that any non-papers it has received from the UK to date fall well short of the agreed aims and objectives of the backstop."" Reaction to 'customs clearance zones' suggestion BBC Europe editor Katya Adler said if the customs sites plan was to become the official UK position, it would be dismissed and rejected by the EU as insufficient. Julian Smith said customs facilities were ""not possible"" in many locations in Northern Ireland However, Northern Ireland Secretary of State Julian Smith said he had not seen reports about custom clearance centres and did not know where the claims had come from. ""The border in Northern Ireland is not just the border, it's the area around the border so I'm very clear on that,"" Mr Smith told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme. He added that the prime minister was ""fully committed"" to the Good Friday Agreement. The DUP's Emma Little-Pengelly said Monday night's reports had caused ""surprise and dismay"" to many in Northern Ireland. She asked the minister to engage with Northern Ireland businesses in order to make it clear that creating facilities set back from the border is not government policy as this would constitute a hard border. The UK is due to leave the EU on 31 October, and Mr Johnson has said this will happen whether or not there is a new deal with Brussels. Currently, there are no border posts, physical barriers or checks on people or goods crossing the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The backstop is a measure in the withdrawal agreement, between Theresa May and the EU, which is designed to ensure that continues after the UK leaves the EU. It comes into effect only if the deal deciding the future relationship between the UK and EU is not agreed by the end of the transition period. UK to reveal detailed plan for Brexit negotiations What are the Brexit backstop options? 8% of border freight 'could be checked' Currently, there are no border posts, physical barriers or checks on people or goods crossing the border 'Smugglers' charter' Sinn FÃ©in leader Mary-Lou McDonald told the BBC's Today programme the plan was ""essentially the re-imposition of a hard border on Ireland"". SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said the proposals failed to meet the UK's obligations to avoid physical infrastructure. ""It doesn't matter if it's a mile, five miles or 10 miles away, the presence of physical checks will create economic and security challenges that are unacceptable,"" he said. AodhÃ¡n Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, said if the proposals were true, they showed the government had not listened to business in Northern Ireland. He also said the move ""ripped up"" the joint declaration of December 2017 between the EU and UK. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"This video can not be played Nigel Farage was hit with a milkshake while campaigning in Newcastle A Burger King tweet alerting customers it was ""selling milkshakes all weekend"" has been banned for condoning and encouraging anti-social behaviour. The fast food firm's post came after a number of European election candidates had milkshakes thrown at them. And a McDonald's in Edinburgh stopped selling the drinks before Nigel Farage addressed a rally in the city. Burger King defended the tweet, calling it a ""tongue-in-cheek reaction to recent events"". Ice cream ban near Farage campaign rally Milkshake thrown at Nigel Farage It read: ""Dear people of Scotland. We're selling milkshakes all weekend. Have fun. Love BK. #justsaying"". The Advertising Standards Agency (ASA) said it considered the tweet ""irresponsible"". The post on Burger King's official Twitter account followed a number of dairy-based incidents involving campaigners on the European election trail. Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, who is known as Tommy Robinson, and UKIP candidate Carl Benjamin were both hit with food and drink during the build-up to the poll. UKIP candidate in milkshake melee Milkshake thrown over Tommy Robinson Former English Defence League leader Mr Yaxley-Lennon was drenched with milkshakes twice in two days as he campaigned in the north-west of England. Days after his appearance at a Brexit Party rally in Edinburgh, Mr Farage was also later doused with milkshake during a campaign walkabout in Newcastle. The ASA was critical of Burger King's tweet for condoning and encouraging anti-social behaviour. It said 24 people complained that it was irresponsible and offensive because they believed it encouraged violence and anti-social behaviour. The tweet was posted the day after a McDonald's outlet in Edinburgh put up a sign to say that it would not be selling milkshakes or ice cream by ""police request"". Burger King said it did not endorse violence, which it made clear with a follow-up tweet reading: ""We'd never endorse violence - or wasting our delicious milkshakes! So enjoy the weekend and please drink responsibly people."" Dairy items were temporarily withdrawn from sale at an Edinburgh McDonald's during Nigel Farage's visit The ASA said: ""Although we acknowledged that the tweet may have been intended as a humorous response to the suspension of milkshake sales by the advertiser's competitor, in the context in which it appeared we considered it would be understood as suggesting that Burger King milkshakes could be used instead by people to 'milkshake' Nigel Farage. ""We considered the ad therefore condoned the previous anti-social behaviour and encouraged further instances. We therefore concluded that the ad was irresponsible."" The ASA added: ""We told Burger King to ensure that its future marketing communications did not condone or encourage anti-social behaviour."" A Burger King spokesman said: ""Our tweet regarding the situation in Edinburgh was intended to be a tongue-in-cheek reaction to the situation. It appears some have misinterpreted this as an endorsement of violence, which we absolutely reject. ""At Burger King, we totally believe in individuals' right to freedom of expression and would never do anything that conflicts with this. We'd never endorse violence or wasting our delicious milkshakes.""

"Former Arsenal youngster Serge Gnabry is the first player to score four goals in the second half of a Champions League game Tottenham Hotspur's troubles continued as they were humiliated in the most devastating fashion by Bayern Munich in the Champions League on one of the most embarrassing nights in their recent history as Serge Gnabry scored four goals. The scale of this thrashing for manager Mauricio Pochettino and his players was made even more stark by the fact they took an early lead through Son Heung-min and were on level terms until just before half-time. Bayern posed a huge threat throughout and were quickly on terms through Joshua Kimmich's superb 20-yard finish - but Spurs failed to heed the warning signs and ended up reduced to a rabble as they sunk without a fight in the second half. Strange as it may seem looking at the scoreline, this was an enthralling encounter that really turned on the stroke of half-time when, with matters in the balance, Robert Lewandowski produced a brilliant turn and right-foot finish past Hugo Lloris from 20 yards. 'Embarrassing, abject, pitiful - make no mistake, Spurs and Pochettino are in trouble' We must stick together - Pochettino Gnabry goes from West Brom fringe player to Champions League hero Football Daily podcast: Spurs battered by Bayern This video can not be played 'My feeling is so bad' - Pochettino on heavy Bayern defeat The manner in which Spurs subsided once they went behind will be of huge concern to Pochettino and all those who have detected underlying problems with the manager and his team since they lost the Champions League final to Liverpool in June. Bayern gathered momentum and put themselves out of sight when former Arsenal youngster Gnabry scored twice in as many minutes shortly after the interval, taking full advantage of more poor defending to beat Lloris emphatically. Harry Kane gave Spurs brief hope with a penalty after Kingsley Coman fouled Danny Rose but Bayern were in no mood to open the door, instead running riot as Gnabry added two more, with another smooth finish from Lewandowski sandwiched in between. It is the first time in Tottenham's 137-year history that they have ever conceded seven goals at home in any competition. Spurs left the pitch to a chorus of jeers. They will cling to the fact they reached the final after losing their first two group games last season - but this is the sort of beating that will take a long time to recover from. This was the biggest home defeat of an English team in any European competition Tottenham's display had so much to commend it for the first 35 minutes as they closely resembled the side that reached the Champions League final so dramatically last season, playing with passion, urgency and pace to trade blows with this dangerous Bayern. Even when honours were even, however, danger lurked obviously as Spurs were being exposed on the flanks as the pace of Gnabry and the prowess of Lewandowski flagged up big trouble ahead. And so it proved as, from the moment Lewandowski swept a magnificent low finish past Lloris with virtually the last kick of the first half, Spurs were stretched and picked apart, with the defensive pairing of Toby Alderweireld and Jan Vertonghen looking slow and laboured. The sight of the latter plodding in the wake of Gnabry when he hit the back of the net once more was a particularly ominous sight. Spurs will also look at early chances squandered by Son but there is no escaping the brutal reality of what was done to them by Bayern. This is regarded as a Bayern side in transition, remember they lost at home to Liverpool in the last 16 last season, but by the final whistle it was literally a question of how many they would score as Spurs waited for the whistle like a boxer waiting for the final bell. Spurs can still get out of this group but serious damage will have been inflicted by this loss and its inglorious manner. Mauricio Pochettino has yet to win a trophy in a 10-year managerial career Spurs' battling win against Southampton on Saturday looked to have lifted the siege mentality around manager Pochettino and answered the questions asked after an indifferent start to the season which saw a Carabao Cup exit to League Two Colchester United. Instead, after this, the questions will not only return but will be more probing. This result will not only stun Pochettino, his players and Spurs supporters, it will come as a jolt to chairman Daniel Levy. Spurs now see themselves as big players on this elite European stage but this scoreline paints them as the opposite. Levy will not appreciate that. Pochettino must now rally himself and this bedraggled team, who looked lethargic and lacking the stomach for the fight once Bayern took control. These are decisive days for Pochettino and Spurs. Only one candidate for man of the match. Serge Gnabry has scored as many goals at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium as Harry Kane Tottenham are the first English side to concede seven goals in a European game since they lost 8-0 to Cologne in the 1995 Intertoto Cup This was Mauricio Pochettino's joint heaviest defeat as a manager, alongside a 5-0 loss to Real Madrid in March 2012 with Espanyol This was Bayern's joint second biggest away victory in European competition, behind only a 7-1 win against Roma in October 2014 Spurs conceded seven goals in a competitive match for the first time since December 1996 - a 7-1 Premier League defeat by Newcastle United Serge Gnabry is the only the second German player to score four goals in a Champions League match after Mario Gomez versus Basel in March 2012 (also for Bayern, 7-0 win). Bayern Munich's Robert Lewandowski has scored in his last nine competitive appearances - his longest scoring streak in his German club career. He has scored 14 goals in 10 games for Bayern this season, more than any other player in the big five European leagues. Spurs' Harry Kane has scored more Champions League goals against German teams (five) than he has against sides from any other nation in the competition.
