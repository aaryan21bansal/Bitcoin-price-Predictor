"This video can not be played Raducanu beats Cirstea to progress into fourth round - best shots Wimbledon 2021 on the BBC Venue:All England ClubDates:28 June-11 July Coverage:Live across BBC TV, radio and online with extensive coverage on BBC iPlayer, Red Button, Connected TVs and mobile app. Full detailshere Emma Raducanu's dream debut run at Wimbledon continued into the fourth round with victory over Romania's world number 45 Sorana Cirstea. The 18-year-old British wildcard, ranked 338th and fresh from completing her A-Levels, impressed in a 6-3 7-5 win. Playing on a show court for the first time, she stunned 31-year-old Cirstea by taking eight games in a row. ""I am so speechless right now,"" Raducanu said. ""I didn't know what my reaction would be, and then that just happened. I'm so, so grateful for all the support I had today. ""This is by far the biggest court I've played on. I think I coped quite well in the beginning, I just tried to hold my nerve. ""When I was packing to come into the bubble, my parents said, 'Aren't you packing too much match kit?' I think I'm going to have to do some laundry tonight."" Raducanu becomes the youngest British woman to reach the Wimbledon last 16 in the Open era, and will face Australia's Ajla Tomljanovic next. Tomljanovic wins and accuses Ostapenko of 'lying' about injury in heated third-round match Federer beats Britain's Norrie to reach last 16 Kyrgios retires with injury but says Wimbledon run has given him 'second wind' Kerber and Gauff set up last-16 meeting Emma Raducanu impressed with a strong backhand If we did not know it before, we do now. There is a new star of British tennis - and her name is Emma Raducanu. No-one was more shocked than Raducanu herself when she defeated Marketa Vondrousova on Thursday to reach the third round, saying she ""felt like she was on holiday"". Coached by Nigel Sears, Andy Murray's father-in-law, she was only handed a wildcard into the main draw late on after making her WTA Tour debut at Nottingham earlier in June. But just hours after Wimbledon heard British legend Andy Murrayquestioning his futureafter a third-round exit, it witnessed a new talent breaking through. And as Raducanu walked on to Court One, she could not help but display a wry smile, looking around at the crowd as she laid out her towel and bag. But she was not at all fazed by the thousands watching, holding break point in the very first game though missing out on the chance to take first blood. This video can not be played Wimbledon 2021: Raducanu rules, lockdown hair and awkward Zverev - day six best bits Cirstea - who played her first Wimbledon when her opponent was just five - broke Raducanu in the fourth game. The young Briton broke back immediately in what was the start of a run that will be long remembered. She went on to win eight successive games, sealing the first set in the process, and looked to be careering towards a dominant two-set win. But when Cirstea - who defeated two-time Grand Slam champion Victoria Azarenka in the previous round - broke back in the fifth game, it looked as though the nerves were starting to creep in. She held five break points in a near 15-minute game at 3-4 ahead, but it was a moment in the 12th game that perhaps sealed the match for her. A remarkable backhand winner, that caused her to drop her own racquet in disbelief, was the moment Cirstea's head dropped, and Raducanu - who hit 30 winners in all - went on to earn her place in the fourth round on her third match point. In reaching the last 16, she bumps her prize money up to Â£181,000 - considerably more than her total career earnings before Wimbledon of $39,558 (Â£28,762). Emma Raducanu fell to the ground in shock after clinching victory Two-time Grand Slam champion Tracy Austin on BBC TV She came out and she was fearless from the beginning. She hadn't won a WTA match until this Wimbledon. To me, she seems like an incredible competitor. She's able to rebound immediately. She's a smart court player, she has the defence, the offence, the even-keeled temperament. Cirstea has had a fabulous spring, and she beat Azarenka and was on a high herself. Raducanu seems to play with that right level of engagement, clarity of how she wants to play - that's a very mature match there. Even that last game - it was on her third match point and she stayed calm. Everybody is going to know who she is overnight. She wasn't gifted this match - she took this match. She is still going to be ranked outside the world 200. It's not going to be easy. We've talked about how wide open the tournament is. Tomljanovic hasn't been this deep in a Slam. If you can beat Cirstea... you can beat Tomljanovic.

"Retail bosses have called on the prime minister to take action against violence and abuse aimed at shop staff. Leaders of 100 brands, including Tesco, Sainsbury's, Ikea and Aldi, have signed an open letter calling for greater legal protection for retail workers. The Co-op reported a fourfold rise in violent crime between 2014 and 2020, and bosses say things have become even worse during the pandemic. The government said courts should be increasing sentences for such assaults. Shoppers 'must respect staff' when retail reopens Violence against shop staff increasing, survey says 'A fight in my shop but police did nothing' In the letter, organised by the British Retail Consortium (BRC) which represents big chains, the leaders said the situation ""cannot be allowed to get any worse"". They added there was ""a clear need now for better protection in law for retail workers"". ""Victims of abuse, threats and violence carry those experiences with them for life,"" they added. The letter said one business had reported a 76% increase in abuse and a 10% increase in violent attacks during the pandemic ""of which over half involved a weapon, and many of our colleagues have been coughed at or spat on"". Seb James, managing director of Boots, one of the firms to have signed the letter, said violence and aggression towards staff was a ""big problem and it's... getting worse"". ""They get death threats, they get pushed into shelving... the shoplifters react in a way which is neither normal nor in any way acceptable,"" he told BBC business correspondent Katy Austin. Mr James said Boots was ""very committed"" to protecting staff and had recently rolled out body cams to all shop floor workers ""but it's not enough"". ""Whatever structures that we have in place are not enough to be a deterrent. We need to have a really good legal framework that will enable our colleagues, and people that feel tempted to behave in this way, to know where they stand,"" he added. Retailers are spending record amounts on crime prevention and have invested Â£1.2bn in the past year, the BRC said. Its survey of retail crime in 2019, before the pandemic, found a 7% year-on-year increase in violence and abuse to 455 cases each day. In evidence to MPs, Joanne Cairns of trade union Usdaw outlined some of the comments reported by its members during Covid. She said one worker was screamed at due to an out of stock item and said members of the public coughed on them as they were stacking shelves. ""I had somebody pull my mask off and call me a sheep,"" she reported another worker as saying. Another added: ""Since the pandemic, I've had abuse nearly every day, even been coughed on twice."" This video can not be played 'I thought I was going to get stabbed,' says shop worker recalling robbery Shop workers in Scotland are protected by a specificProtection of Workers Bill,externalthat makes it a specific, new criminal offence to assault, threaten, abuse, obstruct or hinder workers in shops, bars and restaurants. Crime and policing minister Kit Malthouse said: ""It is completely unacceptable to threaten or assault retail staff, not least when they are working so hard to keep vital services running, and we absolutely condemn this behaviour. ""We are putting 20,000 extra police officers into our communities to cut crime - including retail crime - and we launched the #ShopKind campaign in April to provide better support to victims and encourage customers to treat shop workers with dignity and respect. ""The Sentencing Council has set out guidelines that mean courts should be increasing sentences for assaults committed against those providing a service to the public, including shop workers.""

"Richard Woodcock's family have paid tribute to him after his body was found in a neighbour's flat after going to help rescue a child The family of a man believed to have been murdered while trying to help rescue a child have said they are ""immensely proud"" of him. The body of Richard Woodcock, 38, was found in a flat in Denmead, Two Mile Ash, Milton Keynes, on 26 June. His widow described him as her ""soulmate"" and the ""best father"".

"Some 500 Coop supermarket stores in Sweden have been forced to close due to an ongoing ""colossal"" cyber-attack affecting organisations around the world. Coop Sweden says it closed more than half of its 800 stores on Friday after point-of-sale tills and self-service checkouts stopped working. The supermarket was not itself targeted by hackers - but is one of a growing number of organisations affected by an attack on a large software supplier the company uses indirectly. Cyber researchers say about 200 businesses have been hit by this ""colossal"" ransomware attack, which had mainly affected the US. Cyber-security firm Huntress Labs said the hack targeted Florida-based IT company Kaseya before spreading through corporate networks that use its software. The firm believes the Russia-linked REvil ransomware gang was responsible. Kaseya said in a statement on its own website that it was investigating a ""potential attack"". A sign on one of the shut Coop shops in Sweden says the company has been hit by ""a large IT disturbance"" A spokeswoman for Coop Sweden told the BBC: ""We first noticed problems in a small number of stores on Friday evening around 6:30pm so we closed those stores early. Then overnight we realised it was much bigger and we took the decision not to open most of our stores this morning so that our teams could work out how to fix it. ""The whole paying system at our tills and our self-service checkouts stopped working so we need time to reboot the system."" It's understood that Coop doesn't use Kesaya directly on its systems but that one of their software providers does. The case highlights the growing concern in the cyber-security world about so-called supply chain attacks where hackers are able to claim multiple victims by attacking their supplier. The US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency, a federal body,said in a statement,externalthat it was taking action to address the attack and urging users of the Kesaya software to shut it down. The UK's National Cyber Security Centre said: ""We are aware of a cyber incident involving Kaseya, and we are working to fully understand its impact. ""Ransomware is a growing, global cyber threat, and all organisations should take immediate steps to limit risk and follow our advice on how to put in place robust defences to protect their networks."" The cyber-breach looks to have been timed for maximum disruption as it emerged on Friday afternoon when companies across the US were clocking off for the long Independence Day weekend. Kaseya is urging customers that use its VSA tool to immediately shut down their servers. Kaseya said in its statement that a ""small number"" of companies had been affected, though Huntress Labs said the number was greater than 200. It is not clear what specific companies have been affected, and a Kaseya representative contacted by the BBC declined to give details. Kaseya's website says it has a presence in more than 10 countries and over 10,000 customers. ""This is a colossal and devastating supply chain attack,"" Huntress Labs' senior security researcher John Hammond said in an email. At a summit in Geneva last month, US President Joe Biden said he told Russian President Vladimir Putin he had a responsibility to rein in such cyber-attacks. Mr Biden said he gave Mr Putin a list of 16 critical infrastructure sectors, from energy to water, that should not be subject to hacking. REvil - also known as Sodinokibi - is one of the most prolific and profitable cyber-criminal groups in the world. The gang was blamed by the FBI for a hack in May that paralysed operations at JBS - the world's largest meat supplier. FBI accuses Russia-linked hackers of attack on JBS The ransomware surge ruining lives Should paying hacker ransoms be banned? The group sometimes threatens to post stolen documents on its website - known as the ""Happy Blog"" - if victims don't comply with its demands. REvil was also linked to a co-ordinated attack on nearly two dozen local governments in the US state of Texas in 2019. This video can not be played Technology explained: what is ransomware?

"Supermarket chain Morrisons has accepted a Â£6.3bn ($8.7bn) takeover bid by a US investment group led by the owner of Majestic Wine. Last month, the supermarket group turned down an offer worth Â£5.5bn from a different firm, saying it had significantly undervalued the business. Morrisons chairman, Andrew Higginson, said the new offer was fair, and the chain would ""continue to prosper"". The firm has nearly 500 shops and more than 110,000 staff in the UK. The takeover - led by US private equity group Fortress Investment Group - is subject to shareholder approval but the supermarket group's directors are recommending it is unanimously voted for. Under the deal's terms deal shareholders will get 254p per share - which Morrisons said was a 42% premium on its share price before the offer period - brought about with the disclosure of therejected offer from Clayton Dublier & Rice (CD&R). Mr Higginson said the supermarket's ""performance through the pandemic"" had improved its standing and enabled it to enter discussions with Fortress from ""a hard-won position of strength"". He said it was clear to the supermarket's directors that Fortress had a ""full understanding and appreciation of the fundamental character of Morrisons"". Joshua A Pack, managing partner at Fortress, said the group was committed to being ""good stewards of Morrisons"". Fortress's bid is backed with funding by the Canada Pension Plan and Koch Real Estate Investments - part of Koch Industries. Russ Mould, investment director at stock broker AJ Bell, said the American investors may have considered Morrisons - the UK's fourth largest supermarket group - as being ""unloved, under appreciated and therefore under valued"" meaning they thought they were getting a bargain. Mr Mould added that Fortress had been clear in its statement that it did not plan to sell any of its real estate which he thought was aimed at reassuring staff and wider society that this would not be a case of asset stripping by a private equity firm. Morrisons owns the freehold on about 85% of its properties including its supermarkets. Labour's shadow business minister Seema Malhotra said the government must closely scrutinise the takeover bid and called on ministers to work with the consortium to ensure ""crucial commitments to protect the workforce and the pension scheme are legally binding, and met"". The government said it was committed to ""ensuring that the UK remains open for business, while protecting the livelihoods of British workers and investment in the UK"". Workers union Unite said it wanted ""unbreakable guarantees"" on jobs and conditions or it would not co-operate with any sale. Unite's national officer for road transport Adrian Jones, which represents Morrisons' warehouse and distribution workers, said the company was  ""unique among UK supermarkets"" because it owns its supply chain. Following confirmation of one takeover bid last month, news of another was not unexpected. The message from Fortress and its partners is that this would be a long-term investment rather than precipitate dramatic change. It has made it clear it would support the existing strategy of Morrison's management. Areas for development include the supermarket's online offering. Fortress has also sought to pre-empt and assuage any concerns about the impact its takeover would have on the business, its workforce and supply chain. For example, supporting pay of at least Â£10 an hour, not changing the pension schemes, and not anticipating ""material"" store sale-and-leasebacks. The fact Morrisons owns most of its sites is perceived as a big draw. But still, Labour and the Unite union are demanding further guarantees. If this deal does come to fruition, it will shorten an already short list of the remaining publicly listed UK supermarkets. Richard Lim, of research consultants Retail Economics, said the deal ""signals the biggest shakeup in the UK grocery sector for over a decade"" as the industry grapples with changes brought by the pandemic and post-Brexit supply chains. Adam Leyland, editor-in-chief of trade publication the Grocer, said the fact the bid had been recommended by the board made it more likely to go through and put pressure on CD&R - which could return with a follow up bid. He said the nature of the way a purchase was made was important and said the Morrisons deal, in which he said the consortium planned to ""back the business"", was in contrast to the Issa Brothers buyout of Asda. In that deal a large amount of the Â£6.8bn purchase price wasmet by borrowing in what is know as a leveraged buyout. Morrisons started life as a market stall in Bradford in 1899 but it was not until 1961 that the first supermarket store opened under the name. In 2004, the group boughtrival grocer Safeway for Â£3bn,external, giving it a bigger slice of the market in southern England.

"Cardinal Giovanni Angelo Becciu had been a close adviser to Pope Francis A Vatican judge has ordered 10 people, including an Italian cardinal, to stand trial for alleged financial crimes. Cardinal Angelo Becciu has become the highest-ranked cleric in the Vatican to be indicted over charges that include embezzlement and abuse of office. The 73-year-old cardinal, who denies wrongdoing, was forced to resign last September, but retains his title. The charges relate to a multi-million-dollar property purchase with Church funds in London. Cardinal forced out in rare Vatican resignation Cardinal Becciu was a close aide to Pope Francis and previously had a key job in the Vatican's Secretariat of State, which manages the Church's donations. He will face questions over a controversial loss-making deal to invest in the luxury London building while he was in charge at the secretariat; the deal has since been the subject of a financial investigation. The $200m (Â£155m) paid for the apartment block in Sloane Avenue came out of Church money through offshore funds and companies - a deal the cardinal had defended in the past. In a statement released on Saturday by those close to him, the cardinal said he was ""the victim of a conspiracy"" and protested his ""absolute innocence"", the AFP news agency reports. Analysis by John McManus, BBC News Getting to the heart of the troubling relationship between the Vatican and its finances has become one of the main themes at the Vatican under Pope Francis. Parallel to his desire to make the Church a sanctuary where everybody, however imperfect, can find a place, has been his work to make the Vatican a distinctly unwelcoming destination for those who would use it to enrich themselves. The alleged crimes listed today still have to be proven in court. But the very fact the Pope was ready to sanction the indictment and trial of a cardinal who was not only a senior member of the Vatican hierarchy, but also by his own account a friend of Francis, signals again his clear intention that when it comes to financial wrongdoing he's prepared to take unprecedented action to clean up the Church's reputation. The risk for the Pope, and the Church, is that this trial will open up the possible mismanagement of the Holy See's finances to further public scrutiny. Two former heads of the Vatican's financial intelligence unit are among the 10 defendants. They face charges including embezzlement, money-laundering, fraud, extortion and abuse of office. An Italian woman who worked for Cardinal Becciu was charged with embezzlement last year. The first hearing is set to be held on 27 July,according to the statement,externalon Vatican News.

"This video can not be played Raducanu beats Cirstea to progress into fourth round - best shots Wimbledon 2021 on the BBC Venue:All England ClubDates:28 June-11 July Coverage:Live across BBC TV, radio and online with extensive coverage on BBC iPlayer, Red Button, Connected TVs and mobile app. Full detailshere Emma Raducanu's dream debut run at Wimbledon continued into the fourth round with victory over Romania's world number 45 Sorana Cirstea. The 18-year-old British wildcard, ranked 338th and fresh from completing her A-Levels, impressed in a 6-3 7-5 win. Playing on a show court for the first time, she stunned 31-year-old Cirstea by taking eight games in a row. ""I am so speechless right now,"" Raducanu said. ""I didn't know what my reaction would be, and then that just happened. I'm so, so grateful for all the support I had today. ""This is by far the biggest court I've played on. I think I coped quite well in the beginning, I just tried to hold my nerve. ""When I was packing to come into the bubble, my parents said, 'Aren't you packing too much match kit?' I think I'm going to have to do some laundry tonight."" Raducanu becomes the youngest British woman to reach the Wimbledon last 16 in the Open era, and will face Australia's Ajla Tomljanovic next. Tomljanovic wins and accuses Ostapenko of 'lying' about injury in heated third-round match Federer beats Britain's Norrie to reach last 16 Kyrgios retires with injury but says Wimbledon run has given him 'second wind' Kerber and Gauff set up last-16 meeting Emma Raducanu impressed with a strong backhand If we did not know it before, we do now. There is a new star of British tennis - and her name is Emma Raducanu. No-one was more shocked than Raducanu herself when she defeated Marketa Vondrousova on Thursday to reach the third round, saying she ""felt like she was on holiday"". Coached by Nigel Sears, Andy Murray's father-in-law, she was only handed a wildcard into the main draw late on after making her WTA Tour debut at Nottingham earlier in June. But just hours after Wimbledon heard British legend Andy Murrayquestioning his futureafter a third-round exit, it witnessed a new talent breaking through. And as Raducanu walked on to Court One, she could not help but display a wry smile, looking around at the crowd as she laid out her towel and bag. But she was not at all fazed by the thousands watching, holding break point in the very first game though missing out on the chance to take first blood. This video can not be played Wimbledon 2021: Raducanu rules, lockdown hair and awkward Zverev - day six best bits Cirstea - who played her first Wimbledon when her opponent was just five - broke Raducanu in the fourth game. The young Briton broke back immediately in what was the start of a run that will be long remembered. She went on to win eight successive games, sealing the first set in the process, and looked to be careering towards a dominant two-set win. But when Cirstea - who defeated two-time Grand Slam champion Victoria Azarenka in the previous round - broke back in the fifth game, it looked as though the nerves were starting to creep in. She held five break points in a near 15-minute game at 3-4 ahead, but it was a moment in the 12th game that perhaps sealed the match for her. A remarkable backhand winner, that caused her to drop her own racquet in disbelief, was the moment Cirstea's head dropped, and Raducanu - who hit 30 winners in all - went on to earn her place in the fourth round on her third match point. In reaching the last 16, she bumps her prize money up to Â£181,000 - considerably more than her total career earnings before Wimbledon of $39,558 (Â£28,762). Emma Raducanu fell to the ground in shock after clinching victory Two-time Grand Slam champion Tracy Austin on BBC TV She came out and she was fearless from the beginning. She hadn't won a WTA match until this Wimbledon. To me, she seems like an incredible competitor. She's able to rebound immediately. She's a smart court player, she has the defence, the offence, the even-keeled temperament. Cirstea has had a fabulous spring, and she beat Azarenka and was on a high herself. Raducanu seems to play with that right level of engagement, clarity of how she wants to play - that's a very mature match there. Even that last game - it was on her third match point and she stayed calm. Everybody is going to know who she is overnight. She wasn't gifted this match - she took this match. She is still going to be ranked outside the world 200. It's not going to be easy. We've talked about how wide open the tournament is. Tomljanovic hasn't been this deep in a Slam.

"Supermarket chain Morrisons has accepted a Â£6.3bn ($8.7bn) takeover bid by a US investment group led by the owner of Majestic Wine. Last month, the supermarket group turned down an offer worth Â£5.5bn from a different firm, saying it had significantly undervalued the business. Morrisons chairman, Andrew Higginson, said the new offer was fair, and the chain would ""continue to prosper"". The firm has nearly 500 shops and more than 110,000 staff in the UK. The takeover - led by US private equity group Fortress Investment Group - is subject to shareholder approval but the supermarket group's directors are recommending it is unanimously voted for. Under the deal's terms deal shareholders will get 254p per share - which Morrisons said was a 42% premium on its share price before the offer period - brought about with the disclosure of therejected offer from Clayton Dublier & Rice (CD&R). Mr Higginson said the supermarket's ""performance through the pandemic"" had improved its standing and enabled it to enter discussions with Fortress from ""a hard-won position of strength"". He said it was clear to the supermarket's directors that Fortress had a ""full understanding and appreciation of the fundamental character of Morrisons"". Joshua A Pack, managing partner at Fortress, said the group was committed to being ""good stewards of Morrisons"". Fortress's bid is backed with funding by the Canada Pension Plan and Koch Real Estate Investments - part of Koch Industries. Russ Mould, investment director at stock broker AJ Bell, said the American investors may have considered Morrisons - the UK's fourth largest supermarket group - as being ""unloved, under appreciated and therefore under valued"" meaning they thought they were getting a bargain. Mr Mould added that Fortress had been clear in its statement that it did not plan to sell any of its real estate which he thought was aimed at reassuring staff and wider society that this would not be a case of asset stripping by a private equity firm. Morrisons owns the freehold on about 85% of its properties including its supermarkets. Labour's shadow business minister Seema Malhotra said the government must closely scrutinise the takeover bid and called on ministers to work with the consortium to ensure ""crucial commitments to protect the workforce and the pension scheme are legally binding, and met"". The government said it was committed to ""ensuring that the UK remains open for business, while protecting the livelihoods of British workers and investment in the UK"". Workers union Unite said it wanted ""unbreakable guarantees"" on jobs and conditions or it would not co-operate with any sale. Unite's national officer for road transport Adrian Jones, which represents Morrisons' warehouse and distribution workers, said the company was  ""unique among UK supermarkets"" because it owns its supply chain. Following confirmation of one takeover bid last month, news of another was not unexpected. The message from Fortress and its partners is that this would be a long-term investment rather than precipitate dramatic change. It has made it clear it would support the existing strategy of Morrison's management. Areas for development include the supermarket's online offering. Fortress has also sought to pre-empt and assuage any concerns about the impact its takeover would have on the business, its workforce and supply chain. For example, supporting pay of at least Â£10 an hour, not changing the pension schemes, and not anticipating ""material"" store sale-and-leasebacks. The fact Morrisons owns most of its sites is perceived as a big draw. But still, Labour and the Unite union are demanding further guarantees. If this deal does come to fruition, it will shorten an already short list of the remaining publicly listed UK supermarkets. Richard Lim, of research consultants Retail Economics, said the deal ""signals the biggest shakeup in the UK grocery sector for over a decade"" as the industry grapples with changes brought by the pandemic and post-Brexit supply chains. Adam Leyland, editor-in-chief of trade publication the Grocer, said the fact the bid had been recommended by the board made it more likely to go through and put pressure on CD&R - which could return with a follow up bid. He said the nature of the way a purchase was made was important and said the Morrisons deal, in which he said the consortium planned to ""back the business"", was in contrast to the Issa Brothers buyout of Asda. In that deal a large amount of the Â£6.8bn purchase price wasmet by borrowing in what is know as a leveraged buyout. Morrisons started life as a market stall in Bradford in 1899 but it was not until 1961 that the first supermarket store opened under the name. In 2004, the group boughtrival grocer Safeway for Â£3bn,external, giving it a bigger slice of the market in southern England.

"Supermarket chain Morrisons has accepted a Â£6.3bn ($8.7bn) takeover bid by a US investment group led by the owner of Majestic Wine. Last month, the supermarket group turned down an offer worth Â£5.5bn from a different firm, saying it had significantly undervalued the business. Morrisons chairman, Andrew Higginson, said the new offer was fair, and the chain would ""continue to prosper"". The firm has nearly 500 shops and more than 110,000 staff in the UK. The takeover - led by US private equity group Fortress Investment Group - is subject to shareholder approval but the supermarket group's directors are recommending it is unanimously voted for. Under the deal's terms deal shareholders will get 254p per share - which Morrisons said was a 42% premium on its share price before the offer period - brought about with the disclosure of therejected offer from Clayton Dublier & Rice (CD&R). Mr Higginson said the supermarket's ""performance through the pandemic"" had improved its standing and enabled it to enter discussions with Fortress from ""a hard-won position of strength"". He said it was clear to the supermarket's directors that Fortress had a ""full understanding and appreciation of the fundamental character of Morrisons"". Joshua A Pack, managing partner at Fortress, said the group was committed to being ""good stewards of Morrisons"". Fortress's bid is backed with funding by the Canada Pension Plan and Koch Real Estate Investments - part of Koch Industries. Russ Mould, investment director at stock broker AJ Bell, said the American investors may have considered Morrisons - the UK's fourth largest supermarket group - as being ""unloved, under appreciated and therefore under valued"" meaning they thought they were getting a bargain. Mr Mould added that Fortress had been clear in its statement that it did not plan to sell any of its real estate which he thought was aimed at reassuring staff and wider society that this would not be a case of asset stripping by a private equity firm. Morrisons owns the freehold on about 85% of its properties including its supermarkets. Labour's shadow business minister Seema Malhotra said the government must closely scrutinise the takeover bid and called on ministers to work with the consortium to ensure ""crucial commitments to protect the workforce and the pension scheme are legally binding, and met"". The government said it was committed to ""ensuring that the UK remains open for business, while protecting the livelihoods of British workers and investment in the UK"". Workers union Unite said it wanted ""unbreakable guarantees"" on jobs and conditions or it would not co-operate with any sale. Unite's national officer for road transport Adrian Jones, which represents Morrisons' warehouse and distribution workers, said the company was  ""unique among UK supermarkets"" because it owns its supply chain. Following confirmation of one takeover bid last month, news of another was not unexpected. The message from Fortress and its partners is that this would be a long-term investment rather than precipitate dramatic change. It has made it clear it would support the existing strategy of Morrison's management. Areas for development include the supermarket's online offering. Fortress has also sought to pre-empt and assuage any concerns about the impact its takeover would have on the business, its workforce and supply chain. For example, supporting pay of at least Â£10 an hour, not changing the pension schemes, and not anticipating ""material"" store sale-and-leasebacks. The fact Morrisons owns most of its sites is perceived as a big draw. But still, Labour and the Unite union are demanding further guarantees. If this deal does come to fruition, it will shorten an already short list of the remaining publicly listed UK supermarkets. Richard Lim, of research consultants Retail Economics, said the deal ""signals the biggest shakeup in the UK grocery sector for over a decade"" as the industry grapples with changes brought by the pandemic and post-Brexit supply chains. Adam Leyland, editor-in-chief of trade publication the Grocer, said the fact the bid had been recommended by the board made it more likely to go through and put pressure on CD&R - which could return with a follow up bid. He said the nature of the way a purchase was made was important and said the Morrisons deal, in which he said the consortium planned to ""back the business"", was in contrast to the Issa Brothers buyout of Asda. In that deal a large amount of the Â£6.8bn purchase price wasmet by borrowing in what is know as a leveraged buyout. Morrisons started life as a market stall in Bradford in 1899 but it was not until 1961 that the first supermarket store opened under the name. In 2004, the group boughtrival grocer Safeway for Â£3bn,external, giving it a bigger slice of the market in southern England.

"Cardinal Giovanni Angelo Becciu had been a close adviser to Pope Francis A Vatican judge has ordered 10 people, including an Italian cardinal, to stand trial for alleged financial crimes. Cardinal Angelo Becciu has become the highest-ranked cleric in the Vatican to be indicted over charges that include embezzlement and abuse of office. The 73-year-old cardinal, who denies wrongdoing, was forced to resign last September, but retains his title. The charges relate to a multi-million-dollar property purchase with Church funds in London. Cardinal forced out in rare Vatican resignation Cardinal Becciu was a close aide to Pope Francis and previously had a key job in the Vatican's Secretariat of State, which manages the Church's donations. He will face questions over a controversial loss-making deal to invest in the luxury London building while he was in charge at the secretariat; the deal has since been the subject of a financial investigation. The $200m (Â£155m) paid for the apartment block in Sloane Avenue came out of Church money through offshore funds and companies - a deal the cardinal had defended in the past. In a statement released on Saturday by those close to him, the cardinal said he was ""the victim of a conspiracy"" and protested his ""absolute innocence"", the AFP news agency reports. Analysis by John McManus, BBC News Getting to the heart of the troubling relationship between the Vatican and its finances has become one of the main themes at the Vatican under Pope Francis. Parallel to his desire to make the Church a sanctuary where everybody, however imperfect, can find a place, has been his work to make the Vatican a distinctly unwelcoming destination for those who would use it to enrich themselves. The alleged crimes listed today still have to be proven in court. But the very fact the Pope was ready to sanction the indictment and trial of a cardinal who was not only a senior member of the Vatican hierarchy, but also by his own account a friend of Francis, signals again his clear intention that when it comes to financial wrongdoing he's prepared to take unprecedented action to clean up the Church's reputation. The risk for the Pope, and the Church, is that this trial will open up the possible mismanagement of the Holy See's finances to further public scrutiny. Two former heads of the Vatican's financial intelligence unit are among the 10 defendants. They face charges including embezzlement, money-laundering, fraud, extortion and abuse of office. An Italian woman who worked for Cardinal Becciu was charged with embezzlement last year. The first hearing is set to be held on 27 July,according to the statement,externalon Vatican News.

"This video can not be played England thrash Ukraine to set up first Euro semi-final in 25 years England produced a magnificent display as they thrashed Ukraine in Rome to set up a Euro 2020 semi-final against Denmark at Wembley. Manager Gareth Southgate's side followed up the landmark victory over Germany in the last 16 by producing a performance of composure and the highest quality to continue their impressive progress in this tournament. Harry Kane was back to his predatory best after struggling in the group stage, following up his goal against Germany by poking home a superb pass from Raheem Sterling after only four minutes. Ukraine barely threatened and England - having reached the last four at the 2018 World Cup - were on their way to a second successive semi-final when Harry Maguire powered home a header from Luke Shaw's free-kick seconds after the break. And the outstanding Shaw was the creator once more four minutes later with a perfect cross that was headed in from six yards by Kane. England were so impressive as they simply overpowered Ukraine with substitute Jordan Henderson getting the fourth - his first international goal, in his 62nd appearance - when he arrived with perfect timing to head in Mason Mount's corner. To add to England and Southgate's satisfaction, they kept their fifth successive clean sheet to maintain their record of not conceding a goal at Euro 2020. They will now meet Denmark in the last four at Wembley on Wednesday (20:00 BST kick-off). Reaction from Stadio Olimpico as England reach Euro 2020 semi-finals 'England not settling for the semis' - Maguire Denmark beat Czechs to reach last four How you rated the players This video can not be played 'That didn't take long!' - Kane strikes to give England early lead England manager Southgate never wavered for a second in his belief that captain Kane would have a significant impact on Euro 2020, even when he looked off the pace and out of sorts when failing to score in group games against Croatia, Scotland and the Czech Republic. Southgate's faith was rewarded when Kane got off the mark with England's crucial second in the 2-0 win over Germany. It was the catalyst for the real Kane to come alive in the tournament - and he punished Ukraine in trademark style. Kane pounced for his first, rose to power in a second for his 47th England goal and almost completed a hat-trick in spectacular fashion with a left-foot volley that was turned on to the post by Ukraine keeper Georgi Bushchan. He was a constant threat, his link with Sterling increasingly impressive, and has timed his return to peak form perfectly as England now stand only 90 minutes away from their first major final since they won the World Cup in 1966. Kane is the man defences fear - and even the in-form Danes will regard this display as ominous. This video can not be played Euro 2020: Harry Kane heads home England's third against Ukraine England want to go two steps further than World Cup semi - Southgate 'England fans transported to unfamiliar world' Who stands between England and Euros glory? Manchester United's Shaw has had to fight to revive his England career - having been behind Chelsea's Ben Chilwell for some time, he missed out on a start against Croatia in the Euro 2020 opener, when Southgate used Kieran Trippier in the left-back role. It has all changed since he was brought into the side for the goalless draw against Scotland. Shaw has made a magnificent contribution to England's run to the semi-final and will be one of the first names on the teamsheet for the game against Denmark. Shaw has been solid in defence while proving to be a potent creator of goals, setting up Sterling's vital opening goal against Germany then setting up two more here, first with pitch-perfect delivery from a free-kick and then a perfect cross. It has not been a smooth ride for Shaw, who emerged as a teenager at Southampton before his big-money move to Manchester United in June 2014. He has suffered serious injury at United, and was never trusted by Jose Mourinho when he was their manager, but is now delivering for England in a major tournament - proof of his character, and an achievement that makes that long road even more worthwhile. Southgate has manoeuvred his England squad with great expertise throughout Euro 2020, demonstrating the riches he has at his disposal. In Rome, he was able to give a first start in the tournament to Jadon Sancho, the 21-year-old who has just agreed a Â£73m move to Manchester United from Borussia Dortmund. Sancho slotted in perfectly, showing huge confidence and ambition in a timely reminder of what he can offer. Chelsea's Mount also returned the England side, with two creators in the shape of Aston Villa captain Jack Grealish and Manchester City's Phil Foden left on the bench. Henderson, the vastly experienced Liverpool captain, made his mark while Marcus Rashford was also introduced off the bench. It was proof, amid an imperious victory, that Southgate's England squad has the sort of quality and depth that will make them confident they can finally end that 55-year wait for success. Gareth Southgate is just the second manager to take England's men to the semi-final of both the World Cup and the European Championship, after Alf Ramsey in 1966 and 1968. The Three Lions have kept seven consecutive clean sheets for the first time in their history. They have not conceded for 662 minutes. This was Ukraine's joint-biggest defeat in a match at a major tournament, equalling their 4-0 defeat by Spain in the group stages of the 2006 World Cup. Raheem Sterling has been involved in 22 goals in his past 21 games for England (15 goals, seven assists), while Harry Kane has been involved in 27 in his past 26 for the Three Lions (18 goals, nine assists). Sterling has provided six assists for Harry Kane for England in all competitions, more than any England player has assisted another in the 21st Century. Luke Shaw's assist for Harry Maguire was the first time two Manchester United players have combined for an England goal at a major tournament since David Beckham assisted Paul Scholes against Portugal at Euro 2000. England keeper Jordan Pickford has kept five clean sheets at Euro 2020 - no keeper has ever kept more in a single staging of the competition before.

"This video can not be played Angela Merkel says Germany will relax the need for quarantine rules for some travellers Double-jabbed people should be able to travel from the UK to Germany without quarantining ""in the foreseeable future"", Angela Merkel has said. The German chancellor said her country was ""continuously reviewing"" its Covid travel restrictions, after meeting Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Mr Johnson said he thought progress was being made on the issue. Mrs Merkel is visiting the UK in her final official trip as chancellor. What are the UK's travel rules? In a press conference following their talks at Chequers, the prime minister's Buckinghamshire residence, the two leaders spoke about trade and post-Brexit relations. The chancellor was then asked when Britons who have had two doses of a coronavirus vaccine should expect to be able to travel to Germany. She said Germany had adopted restrictions in response to the Delta variant, which she said was now spreading ""very rapidly"" in her country. ""But as you know we are reviewing continuously our travel restrictions and we think that in the foreseeable future those who have received double jabs will then, according to our classification - and now Britain obviously is a high incidence area - will be able to travel again without having to go into quarantine,"" she said. ""At the beginning we didn't have much experience with this variant but we're dealing with it,"" she added. ""And that is a continuous learning process... we have to adjust time and again to the most recent developments."" Mrs Merkel, who is due to step down later this year, also met the Queen at Windsor Castle. And she addressed a meeting of the UK cabinet - the first foreign leader to do so since President Clinton in 1997, although on this occasion the meeting was a virtual one. Mrs Merkel's comments about travel mark a change in tone. Last week said she wanted other countries to follow Germany's lead by introducing tougher restrictions for UK travellers because of concerns about the Delta variant, which was first identified in India. Since May, travellers from the UK have been banned from entering Germany,aside from a few limited exceptions,external. Those who are allowed in from the UK must quarantine for 14 days. However, Mrs Merkel did express ""grave concern"" about the numbers of football fans attending Euro 2020 matches at Wembley Stadium, and said she had outlined this during their talks. ""We in Germany, as you know, have less people attend games in the Munich stadium but the British government will obviously take its own decision,"" she said. ""But I am very much concerned whether it is not a bit too much."" Mr Johnson said sporting events were being opened up in a ""very careful and controlled manner"" and that vaccinations had built up a ""very considerable wall of immunity"" in the UK. He is expected to announce the latest steps towards ending lockdown in England in the next few days, with international travel high on the agenda. The talks followreports that the European Union's passport schemedoes not recognise doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine manufactured in India known as Covishield. Mr Johnson said during the press conference he was ""very confident"" that there ""will not prove to be a problem"" for travellers who have received these jabs. On Friday, the UK recorded 27,125 new Covid cases and a further 27 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. More than 85% of UK adults have had their first dose of a coronavirus vaccine, and more than 63% are fully vaccinated,according to the government's coronavirus dashboard.,external ""YOU CAN'T PUT A PRICE ON YOUR FACE"":An inside look into unregulated training in aesthetics 36 HOURS TO AVOID HOMELESSNESS:Mother-of-four Rosie tries to keep her family afloat PM confident of no problem over India jab travel What are the UK's travel rules?
