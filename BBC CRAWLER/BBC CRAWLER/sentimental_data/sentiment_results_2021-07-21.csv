"The UK has unveiled a new set of demands to redraw the post-Brexit trading arrangements it agreed with the EU for Northern Ireland. The government said border checks on goods from Great Britain it signed up to in the 2019 Brexit divorce deal had proved unsustainable. Brexit Minister Lord Frost said they risked harming business, and were damaging the ""fabric"" of the UK. The EU said it would not agree to renegotiate the terms of the 2019 deal. The checks are included in the Northern Ireland Protocol, a section of the Brexit deal designed to avoid border checks on the island of Ireland. Lord Frost called on the EU to look on the UK's proposals with ""fresh eyes,"" adding: ""We cannot go on as we are."" M&S to cut Christmas products in Northern Ireland No renegotiation on Protocol as UK warns of action DUP leader calls for renegotiation of Brexit deal What is the Northern Ireland Protocol? However, he announced the UK would not be triggering Article 16 of the protocol - which would allow it to suspend parts of the Brexit deal - before talks with Brussels. He added that the government believed using it was justifiable, but said: ""Nevertheless, we have concluded that it is not the right moment to do so."" Lord Frost told the House of Lords there was a ""growing sense in Northern Ireland we have not found the right balance, seen in an ongoing febrile political climate, protests and regrettable instances of occasional disorder"". He also called on the EU to agree a ""standstill period"" to prevent a ban on sending chilled meat products such as sausages from Great Britain coming into force in September, when the full terms of the deal kick in. He later told reporters it was ""perfectly normal to change treaties in the light of experience, and it happens all the time"". In a28-page document,external, the UK government suggested changes to: remove customs checks on goods where the GB-registered businesses sending them have declared their final destination is Northern Ireland get rid of certificates and checks for food products ""only ever intended to be consumed in Northern Ireland"" remove medicines entirely from the scope of the protocol allowing labelled goods conforming to UK rules to circulate freely in Northern Ireland alongside EU-registered products The future of the Irish border was a huge sticking point during Brexit talks The protocol was agreed to prevent the return of a hard border between the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland, as both the UK and EU want to prevent any return to the Troubles, which lasted 30 years and cost more than 3,500 lives. Under its terms, Northern Ireland effectivelyremains part of the EU's single market,externalfor goods, meaning it complies with standards set by Brussels. The biggest practical difficulty, in trade terms, concerns the movement of food from Britain to Northern Ireland, which could then be transported into the EU via the Irish land border. The prime minister's former chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, has told BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg that the protocol had been a ""fudge"". Both sides had wanted to ""sign up to something that was not what either side really wanted and which punted difficult questions into the future to figure out later"", he added. This video can not be played Brexit deal was ""inherently self-contradictory in various ways,"" says Dominic Cummings European Commission Vice-President MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ said the EU was willing to ""seek creative solutions within the framework of the protocol"" to ease border issues. But he added the 27-member union would not agree to a ""renegotiation"" of the Brexit deal. ""Respecting international legal obligations is of paramount importance,"" he added. DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said: ""We welcome the acceptance from the government that the protocol is not working, that it is causing real harm to our economy in Northern Ireland and it is simply not sustainable."" He called the UK government's statement - and its publication of a command paper describing its demands - an ""important first step"". However, Sinn Fein Brexit spokesperson Declan Kearney called on the UK government to ""stop the evasion"" and ""get on"" with implementing the deal it agreed. ""It is not acceptable for the Tories to adopt an a la carte approach towards the protocol, to rewrite history, and now attempt a renegotiation,"" he added. Industry group Manufacturing NI said the UK's proposals would create ""confusion and uncertainty for business"" and were likely to ""create conflict with the EU"". It called on the EU to ""go further to ensure the UK's market works for business and consumers in Northern Ireland"". ""Both parties owe it to the people in Northern Ireland to skip the drama and get on with dialogue and decision making,"" the body added. For Labour, Brexit spokeswoman Baroness Chapman urged the government to ""fix the problems the prime minister created"". ""Communities are tired of these games and the political stalemate,"" she added.

"The protocol means some goods from Great Britain are now subjected to checks at Northern Ireland's ports Northern Ireland's political parties are divided on calls by the government for the EU to begin negotiations to radically amend the Brexit protocol. On Wednesday, Number 10 gave details of some proposals and said a new arrangement was urgently needed. Unionist parties, which oppose the protocol, have welcomed the statement and urged the EU to engage. But Sinn FÃ©in, the SDLP and Alliance urged the government to agree a veterinary agreement to reduce checks. The UK and EU agreed the Northern Ireland Protocol in 2019, as part of the Brexit withdrawal agreement. It prevents a hard border in Ireland by keeping Northern Ireland in the EU single market for goods. The UK says its implementation has been ""unbalanced"" and is ""unsustainable"" in its current form. Brexit Minister Lord Frost said the full deal should not be implemented andcalled on the EU to look at new proposals with ""fresh eyes"". His comments were welcomed by unionist parties in Northern Ireland, who have called for the protocol to be renegotiated as it is damaging Great Britain to Northern Ireland (GB-NI) trade and posing a risk to the union in its current form. What is the Northern Ireland Protocol? Supermarkets warn of rising costs over NI Protocol Government to publish NI Protocol plans in July Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said there was now a ""tacit acceptance"" from the government that the protocol is not working. ""Sticking plasters and short-term fixes were never going to work. We need a proper renegotiation,"" he said. He criticised the EU and said Brussels had ""failed to recognise the concerns of unionists"". DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson wants the Northern Ireland Protocol renegotiated The government has issued a 28 page command paper to accompany today's ministerial statements. But it boils down to one simple sentiment: ""Trust us."" They are telling the EU that it's single market can be protected without the panoply of checks and controls which currently apply to goods entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain. They are suggesting this can largely be achieved through a light-touch, trusted trader scheme and new legislation to discourage smuggling. Brexit veterans will recognise these as the sort of ""alternative arrangements"" suggested earlier in this process. The EU was not persuaded then and with trust in short supply it will be a struggle to persuade them now. The Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader Doug Beattie said he hoped Wednesday's statement would lead to ""movement in the direction of finding pragmatic, workable solutions"". ""I hope that the European Union will take their time in considering these proposals in good faith and will not reject them out of hand,"" he added. The UUP leader will travel to Dublin on Thursday to meet the Taoiseach (Irish PM) MicheÃ¡l Martin to make that case to him directly. Stormont's other main parties - Sinn FÃ©in, the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) and Alliance - have said they recognise concerns about the protocol but that must be fully implemented in the absence of another arrangement. Sinn FÃ©in chairman Declan Kearney said the British government had agreed and ratified all elements of the protocol with the European Commission. ""It should now stop the evasion, and get on with it's implementation,"" he said. ""It is not acceptable for the Tories to adopt an a la carte approach towards the protocol, to rewrite history, and now attempt a renegotiation."" SDLP leader Colum Eastwood described the government's statement on Wednesday as a ""shameless position based on political expedience rather than providing the stability that people, businesses and communities in Northern Ireland need"". He said he believed a resolution was still possible but would require the government to ""step back from its bad faith interventions"". Colum Eastwood described the UK government's approach to the protocol as a ""shameless position"" Alliance's deputy leader Stephen Farry also said the government was attempting to ""rewrite history"" and that their actions had undermined trust with the EU in finding sustainable solutions. His party has supported suggestions from the EU for a temporary Swiss-style veterinary agreement as a way to reduce most checks on goods coming into Northern Ireland from Great Britain. That would require the UK to follow all EU agri-food rules. The UK said it is unwilling to cede control to the EU on this issue and is instead pushing for an equivalence arrangement in which the EU would recognise UK food production standards as being equivalent to its own. Simon Hoare, chairman of Westminster's Northern Ireland Affairs Committee, described the UK's new proposals for the protocol as an ""interesting approach"". ""If there is to be any chance of change, mutual and binding trust will be the key currency. I am fearful that this is in short supply and needs to be worked on energetically and now. ""Common sense and pragmatism must not be a dirty word for either side,"" Mr Hoare added. Earlier, Ireland's Europe minister, Thomas Byrne, said ""there can be no renegotiation of the [NI] protocol"". But he added that the arrangement had its complications, and said Irish government is ""willing to discuss any creative solutions within the confines of the protocol"". The EU has strict rules about the importation of chilled meat products like mince and sausages Ahead of the publication of the UK paper, thechairman of Marks & Spencer Archie Norman warned of the impact of full protocol checkson fresh foods when grace periods end this autumn. ""This Christmas, I can tell you already, we're having to make decisions to delist product for Northern Ireland because it's simply not worth the risk of trying to get it through,"" he said. Mr Norman called for a ""common sense"" solution to post-Brexit problems at his firm's stores on the island of Ireland. The M&S said the level of checks and controls are ""very threatening"" to Marks and Spencer's Irish business. He suggests the easiest solution would be to ""agree a time limited veterinary/food standards agreement"". Speaking on Radio 4 on Wednesday morning, Mr Norman said the problems his company has faced exporting to the Republic of Ireland are likely to be replicated in Northern Ireland by the autumn. ""At the moment only about 80% of our product is getting into [the Republic of] Ireland - so 20% doesn't arrive at all,"" he said. ""It's not the rules of the Customs Union that is the problem, it's the Byzantine and pointless and honestly pettifogging enforcement which means that wagons can't get through."" He said trucks had been turned away on the basis of the wrong colour of typeface used on documents. ""We're employing 13 full-time vets who are not looking after animals or welfare, they're simply ticking boxes and filling out forms,"" he added. ""Sandwiches typically require about three vets' certificates to get through. ""Come October our experience in southern Ireland is probably, as it currently stands, set to be replicated in Northern Ireland.""

"Marks & Spencer has warned it is already cutting Christmas products in Northern Ireland due to concerns over forthcoming post-Brexit customs checks. Chairman Archie Norman told Radio Four's Today Programme the changes could mean higher prices and less choice for Northern Ireland customers. Mr Norman said current ""pointless"" checks with the Republic of Ireland were ""threatening"" to its business. He called for a ""common sense approach to enforcement."" TheUK is expected later to warn the EU it is prepared to unilaterally override the Brexit arrangements for Northern Ireland if a simplified agreement cannot be reached. Right now, supermarkets who send products there from Great Britain face only light-touch checks, under a so-called ""grace period"" which delayed some of the new processes. That runs out at the end of September. The Northern Ireland Protocol helps prevent the need for checks on the island of Ireland's internal border. But in the first warning from a major retailer on the scale of the potential problems, former Conservative party MP Mr Norman said once light-touch export checks end, there will be ""gaps on the shelves"". ""This Christmas, I can tell you already, we're having to make decisions to delist product for Northern Ireland because it's simply not worth the risk of trying to get it through,"" he said. ""We've already made that decision. We're waiting to see how serious it's going to be but if it's anything like southern Ireland (the Republic of Ireland), and at the moment it's set to be, then it's going to be very, very serious for customers."" Marks and Spencer is a major employer in Ireland, with more than 4,000 staff. In a letter to Brexit minister Lord Frost, Mr Norman said the current EU customs arrangements were ""totally unsuited and were never designed for a modern fresh food supply chain between closely intertwined trading partners"". ""There is no other outcome for consumers in Northern Ireland in the end other than higher prices, given the inflationary pressures being put on to retailers by the regulatory regime,"" Mr Norman wrote. ""Being able to keep the show on the road, let alone growing, is going to be very challenging,"" he added. Mr Norman told the BBC that ""pettifogging enforcement"" of the rules required M&S to employ 14 full-time vets, ""simply ticking boxes and filling out forms"", in order to certify its products. ""Sandwiches typically require three veterinary certificates to get through,"" he said. Because of the way the system worked, M&S had had to give up exporting half its sandwich range to Ireland, he said. If forms were filled in incorrectly, that meant delays, with everything on paper and nothing digital, Mr Norman said. ""If one page is blue instead of black typeface, the entire wagon is turned away,"" he added. Mr Norman said that if the same regime was replicated in Northern Ireland at the end of September, it would be ""incendiary"" for the public there. What's the Northern Ireland Protocol? DUP sets out seven tests for NI Brexit deal M&S marks 50 years of trading in Belfast Mr Norman said M&S was one of the largest UK-based retailers operating in Ireland as a whole and played ""a disproportionate role"" in Northern Ireland. ""Our market share in Northern Ireland is almost double our share on the UK mainland. In part, this reflects our history as the only major UK retailer that committed to trade and invest continuously through the Troubles,"" he said. ""Our commitment and involvement with the people and communities of Northern Ireland remains strong. We are also a major employer and investor with over 4,000 people employed directly by M&S and many more in our supply chain."" He added that last year, M&S invested more than Â£10m in the business in Northern Ireland. However, the issues raised by the current customs arrangements, in which Northern Ireland remains part of the EU Single Market while the rest of the UK has left, were ""very threatening to our business"", he said. Ireland's European affairs minister Thomas Byrne said it was willing to discuss ""any creative solutions"". ""But we have to recognise as well that Britain decided itself to leave the single market of the European Union, to apply trade rules, to apply red tape to its goods that are leaving Britain, to goods that are coming into Britain,"" he added. The EU has said a temporary Swiss-style veterinary agreement for Northern Ireland, in which the UK continues to follow EU agri-food rules, could be a solution, but it has been rejected by the UK. In his letter, Mr Norman said he understood why the UK government was ""not favourably disposed"" to this solution, although he added that it was ""by far the best way of delivering a smooth trade flow"". Regardless of this, he added, many problems could be solved by a willingness to overlook ""trivial"" errors in paperwork and efforts to set up a ""trusted trader"" scheme. ""Any scheme should start on the basis that we are prepared to follow EU standards for products going to Northern Ireland,"" he said. ""The debate is not about meeting standards, this is about what we are required to do to show we are compliant."" Number 10 said Mr Norman's letter was a ""stark warning"" of ""the fundamental problems with the Protocol"". ""That is why we need to urgently tackle these issues, to ensure there is minimal disruption to people's lives in Northern Ireland, as the Protocol itself intended,"" it added. It plans to set out details later on its approach to the Northern Ireland Protocol. The sort of products M&S is considering taking off the list for Northern Ireland this Christmas are ones containing a lot of different ingredients. For example, special occasion food like pies or pates, which people might order for a celebration. Today, the company's chairman wants to send a message that the way post-Brexit rules on trade with EU countries have been implemented is making it extremely difficult to get products over to the Republic of Ireland, forcing the retailer to cut back the range it sells there. And he fears Northern Ireland is heading the same way. It won't be a co-incidence that Archie Norman's intervention comes just before we expect to hear more on the government's proposals. He presents an argument for introducing less disruptive trade processes after the grace periods expire. Whether the EU will accept that is a whole other question.

"The government has set out new post-Brexit trade arrangements between Northern Ireland, the rest of the UK and the European Union (EU). Northern Ireland's largest unionist party, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), refused to support earlier plans but has backed the new deal. Itclears the way for the Northern Ireland Assembly to meet again- two years after power-sharing collapsed. Trade between Northern Ireland, the rest of the UK and the Republic of Ireland was straightforward before Brexit - all parties were in the EU and shared the same trade rules. However, when the UK left the EU, a deal was required to allow trade to continue between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The EU has strict food rules, and requires border checks when certain goods - such as milk and eggs - arrive from non-EU countries like the UK. Paperwork is also required for other goods. But the idea of checks at the Irish border is a sensitive issue because of Northern Ireland's political history. It was feared that introducing cameras or border posts as part of checks on incoming and outgoing goods could lead to instability. Post-Brexit controls on food and farm imports start What trade deals has the UK done since Brexit? The new dealagreed between the UK government and the DUP,external- called ""Safeguarding the Union"" - will reduce checks and paperwork on goods going from Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) to Northern Ireland. There will be no routine checks on British items being sold to consumers in Northern Ireland. However, some British products brought in for processing, such as raw materials and components, will still face full customs processes. DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said the deal meets his party's objectives. He said: ""We're no longer in a situation where if you bring goods in to sell in Northern Ireland, you need a customs declaration."" The UK government will also introduce two pieces of legislation, to guarantee Northern Irish goods can be sold in Great Britain in all circumstances, and to confirm Northern Ireland's place in the UK. A new body called Intertrade UK will work to boost trade between UK nations. At present, some online shoppers in Northern Ireland are told goods sold in the rest of the UK are not available for them to buy. What exactly is in the DUP deal? The first agreement with the EU, called the Northern Ireland Protocol, came into force on 1 January 2021. That introduced new checks on goods from Great Britain, at Northern Ireland's ports. The checks applied even if the goods were to remain in Northern Ireland. This angered unionists and led the DUP to boycott Northern Ireland's power-sharing administration at Stormont. The Windsor Framework was announced by Rishi Sunak and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen The protocol was amended by another agreement called the Windsor Framework, which wasadopted by the UK and EU in 2023. It created two ""lanes"" for goods arriving in Northern Ireland from Great Britain: Agreen lanefor goods remaining in Northern Ireland Ared lanefor goods which may be sent on to the EU Products going through the green lane do not need checks or additional paperwork. Red lane goods are still subject to checks. A ban on certain products - like chilled sausages - entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain was removed. And Northern Ireland no longer had to follow certain EU rules, for example on VAT and alcohol duties. The Windsor Framework also introduced a mechanism called the ""Stormont brake"",which would let the Northern Ireland Assembly object to new EU rules which would affect Northern Ireland's trade arrangements. That has not been tested yet because the assembly has not sat since the agreement was made. Despite the DUP's refusal to support the Windsor Framework,the system of green and red lines started operating on 1 October 2023. The BBC's NI economics and business editor John Campbell says the new deal maximises the flexibility allowed under the existing Windsor Framework, without changing its fundamental elements.

"This video can not be played Video showed floodwater rising on a busy commuter train As floodwater crashed through a busy subway station in China on Tuesday, desperate passengers tried to flee while others were swept helplessly off platforms. In one train carriage, water seeped in and rose from ankle, to waist, to neck-height. Panicked commuters stretched upwards to breathe, while others lifted shorter people into the shrinking air pocket above. In terrifying videos shared on social media, some passengers can be seen standing on chairs and clinging to the ceiling as the floodwater creeps upwards. One tried to smash a window, before realising that there was even more water outside the carriage. Some filmed the unfolding tragedy, while others called loved ones or posted pleas for help. ""I can't speak any more,"" one woman wrote on the social media site Weibo. ""If no rescue comes in 20 minutes, hundreds of us will lose our lives."" ""We were all standing on the seats, and the water was already on our knees,"" a woman who gave her name as Ms Li told Elephant News. ""Some shorter passengers had water up to their necks,"" she said, adding that as time went on the air supply began to diminish. After about an hour, the train carriage was plunged into darkness and the oxygen level waned further. ""I was really scared, but the most terrifying thing was not the water, but the diminishing air supply,"" one person told Reuters news agency. After several hours of fear and uncertainty, rescuers were able to gain access through the roof of the carriage and pulled people out. ""We knocked on the glass a bit [on the ceiling]. Then suddenly there was air,"" an unnamed woman told state broadcaster CCTV. Hundreds of people were eventually saved from the flooded subway tunnel in Zhengzhou, a city of 12 million people that sits on the banks of the Yellow River in central Henan province. But at least 12 are known to have died and five were injured in the subway disaster, which came after the region saw more rainfall in three days than it usually would in a year. This is a rainy time of year in China and floods happen annually. However, Chinese scientists say global warming has made the situation more dangerous and warn that extreme weather could become more frequent in the future. Science failed to predict flood and heat intensity Record heat points to 'extraordinary' extremes In Henan, at least 33 people have died and more than 200,000 have been evacuated. Major roads have been turned into rivers, with cars and debris being swept along by fast moving currents. At Shakoulu metro station the shutters are down, a small group of police stand watching at one entrance. ""Is this a crime scene?"" I asked one of them. ""I can't talk to you,"" he replied. This is the place where graphic pictures, shared on social media, showed passengers lying lifeless on the platform below. You can't get down there now. Zhengzhou's metro network is completely closed. Above ground, though, you can see the evidence and the aftermath: there's mud and silt on the edge of the road, on the other side from where I'm writing workers are fixing a part of the surface that was ripped up by the force of the water. But to my right is the clearest evidence of what happened here; a four lane underpass vanishes after a few metres under an impromptu lake. The water stretches out, covering the road, as far as I can see. It comes up almost over the railings on the walkway at the side. Harrowing accounts of the subway tragedy, and of the dramatic flooding around the province, are continuing to emerge, with witnesses describing scenes of fear and chaos. ""At the start there wasn't much water, then it was like it all started coming at once,"" one woman who was on the flooded subway train told the news outlet Pear Video. ""Within about 30 minutes it was up to my shoulders,"" she said. ""It was hard to breathe. A lot of people fainted."" The woman, who wanted to remain anonymous, said she was trapped for more than four hours and cried when she was finally rescued. ""There was so much water on the platform, and there was water streaming out of the cracks in the subway doors,"" another passenger told Jiupai News. ""I'm quite tall, but after about five minutes, the water was already at my chest,"" he said. ""Tall people helped short people and children up onto the seats. I was holding someone's child."" In one post on Weibo, a woman described the panic in the carriage. ""Many people started to suffer breathing difficulties,"" she wrote. ""I heard a nearby passenger on her phone, giving her bank account details to her family, and thought I should do the same."" ""Water was leaking from the cracks in the door, more and more of it, all of us who could, stood on the subway seats,"" another post read. This video can not be played Bulldozers and diggers were used to lift people from flood waters in Zhengzhou Dramatic images have also been shared of rescues above ground. Emergency workers have used long ropes to pull people to safety as they were dragged along by gushing currents. ""I was lucky that I stayed at home, but we [still] felt like we were going to be washed away,"" Wang Qiantold BBC OS from Zhengzhou. ""I've contacted all of my family and luckily they're all safe. ""There's a lot of damage around us. I can see the floods everywhere, lots of cars and water everywhere,"" she said. Rescue efforts are continuing around the province, while further downpours have been forecast for the rest of the week. ""We're all waiting to see if everything will be OK soon,"" Ms Wang said. ""We're very scared.""

"Lorry driver shortages are causing temporary fuel supply issues at some of BP's petrol stations. The oil firm said shortages of unleaded petrol and diesel had seen a ""handful"" of its UK sites close temporarily. However, the oil company said the ""vast majority"" of shortages were being ""resolved within a day"". BP said its supply chain had also been exacerbated by the closure of a distribution terminal due to staff being told to isolate last week. ""We are working hard with our haulier supplier to deliver fuel into sites and minimise any disruption to our customers. We apologise for any inconvenience caused,"" BP said. ""Our supply chain has been impacted by the industry-wide driver shortages across the UK, and was exacerbated by the temporary closure of our Hemel Hempstead fuel distribution terminal last week because of necessary Covid-19 isolations amongst staff. The terminal is now operating as normal once again."" Lorry drivers are currently in short supply, with the Road Haulage Association estimating a shortfall of about 60,000. It said some 30,000 HGV driving tests did not take place last year because of the coronavirus pandemic. Previously, a temporary extension of lorry drivers' working hours was met with backlash from the industry who said the government is applying a""sticking plaster"" to driver shortage problems. BP's announcement came as retail industry body the British Retail Consortium (BRC) warned supermarkets were experiencing ""minor disruption"" due to a shortage of drivers. Some supermarkets are understood to be suffering shortages of particular brands. But while customers may not be able to find the exact product they are after, the same product made by different brands is available. The BRC called on the government to ""rapidly increase"" the number of HGV driving tests taking place. The Department for Transport said it is looking to increase testing capacity. Andrew Opie, director of food and sustainability at the BRC, said supermarkets were working closely with suppliers to ""ensure consumers still have access"" to the same selection of goods. ""Government must rapidly increase the number of HGV driving tests taking place, fill gaps by providing visas for EU HGV drivers, and also look for a longer-term solution to this issue,"" he added. Some stores have also reported an increase in workers having to self isolate due to being ""pinged"" by the NHS Covid app, but levels are not said to be near previous peaks in the pandemic. Other sectors are also experiencing staff shortages due to workers needing to isolate. Royal Mail said in a ""limited number of areas"" services were being disrupted due to Covid-related absences. The shortages in workers comes as the government announced firms can apply for staff to be exempt from coronavirus self-isolation rules. The government has said there will be no list of critical workers exempt from isolating rules and exemptions will be ""considered on a case-by-case basis"". However, the numbers of those who will be granted exemption outside of the NHS are expected to be relatively small, and not reach the high tens of thousands. Rod McKenzie, of the Road Haulage Association, said the government's plan was ""confusing"" and felt like ""it's been rushed"". He said: ""Where do you draw the line on lorry drivers, essential workers, the people in the supply chains? Because most of the people I know in the supply chain would say 'hang on a sec, I'm an essential worker'."" In a letter to the logistics sector,external, government ministers said they would consult about ""the delegation of off-road manoeuvres"" as part of the HGV test, which they said would boost testing capacity. It added the Department for Transport would also look to into issuing provisional licences to drive rigid and articulated lorries. Downing Street previously said that the first exemptions around self-isolation have been given in some critical sectors.

"Andrew Dymock had denied 15 offences relating to terrorism and hatred A neo-Nazi student who created two extremist groups and promoted a ""distorted and wicked cause"" has been jailed. Andrew Dymock, 24, from Bath, led the outlawed groups System Resistance Network (SRN) and Sonnenkrieg Division. A judge said Dymock was ""driven by an extremist mindset"" and had taken the path of ""total hatred and bigotry"". He was convicted of 15 offences and jailed for seven years, with a further three years on extended licence. Dymock's trial in June heard he used the SRN website and a Twitter account to state thatJewish people should be exterminatedand encourage lone actor terror attacks. He advocated for societal collapse and a race war, and called for gay peopleto be ""purged"" from society. Jurors were shown this image of Dymock during his trial Judge Mark Dennis QC, sitting at The Old Bailey, said he believed Dymock was dangerous and posed a ""significant risk of serious harm"" to the public. ""It is clear you were a leader and not a follower,"" he said. He added Dymock was an ""intelligent, well-read"" person but also ""wholly misguided"". The court had heard Dymock wrote an online article stating a ""racial holy war is inevitable"" and that ""every stabbing, bombing, shooting further plays into our hands"". The neo-Nazi given away by his rainbow sheets He was expelled from SRN in late February 2018 and arrested in June of that year at Gatwick Airport, as he tried to board a flight to the US. In his luggage police found extreme right-wing literature including Siege, an anthology of pro-Nazi essays written by James Mason, and Mein Kampf, along with clothing bearing neo-Nazi logos. Images taken from SRN videos were shown to jurors Judge Dennis said: ""Despite all the advantages of a good education and family upbringing you chose, at the age of 20, to take the path of dreadful bigotry, intolerance and hatred towards other members of our society solely on the basis of their race, creed or sexual orientation. ""In setting up and running the website and Twitter account for your extremist cause, you were prepared to inflame such vile prejudices in others and to promote and encourage hatred and violence towards other human beings in furtherance of your distorted and wicked cause."" The former student had been supported throughout his trial by his parents, Stella and Dr David Dymock, a professor of dentistry at Bristol University, who he lived with. The court heard they had written to the judge asking for leniency ahead of the sentencing. Defence lawyer Andrew Morris said they were ""extremely worried"" about the impact of jail on their son. Dymock told jurors ""thank you for killing me"" when he was convicted Dymock, who at the time was studying politics at Aberystwyth University in Wales, denied being behind the SRN accounts, claiming he wasset up by an ex-girlfriend, who had failed to recruit him to join banned terrorist group National Action (NA). He denied being a neo-Nazi and told police: ""In fact, I am bisexual but lean towards being homosexual, in direct conflict with Nazism."" He was found guilty of five charges of encouraging terrorism, two of fundraising for terrorism, four counts of disseminating terrorist publications, possessing a terrorist document, stirring up racial hatred and hatred based on sexual orientation, and possessing racially inflammatory material. Dymock's trial was shown images of him performing nazi salutes and holding extremist flags Det Chf Supt Martin Snowden, head of Counter Terrorism Policing North East, which led the investigation into Dymock, said: ""Dymock represented a threat to our society, not simply because of his mindset but because of the considerable efforts he exerted spreading his ideology and misusing his abilities.""

"Liverpool's World Heritage status recognised the architectural landmarks on the waterfront Liverpool has been stripped of its World Heritage status after a UN committee found developments threatened the value of the city's waterfront. The decision was made following a secret ballot by the Unesco committee at a meeting in China. Unesco had said that the developments, including the planned new Everton FC stadium, had resulted in a ""serious deterioration"" of the historic site. The decision was described as ""incomprehensible"" by the city's mayor. ""Our World Heritage site has never been in better condition having benefitted from hundreds of millions of pounds of investment across dozens of listed buildings and the public realm,"" Joanne Anderson said. She said she would work with the government to examine whether the city could appeal against the decision, which comes ""a decade after Unesco last visited the city to see it with their own eyes"". This video can not be played The decision was made at a UN meeting in China Liverpool City Region Mayor Steve Rotheram said the decision was ""a retrograde step that does not reflect the reality of what is happening on the ground"". ""Places like Liverpool should not be faced with the binary choice between maintaining heritage status or regenerating left-behind communities and the wealth of jobs and opportunities that come with it,"" he said. Labour's Kim Johnson, MP for Liverpool Riverside, said she remained ""proud of my city and what we've done"". ""People come here because it's amazing city and, while I'm disappointed, as a city we are resilient and we will always fight back."" An artist's impression of Everton's new stadium, which is being built at Bramley Moore Dock The government said it was ""extremely disappointed"" and believes Liverpool still deserves its heritage status ""given the significant role the historic docks and the wider city have played throughout history"". Liverpool becomes only the third site to lose its World Heritage status since the list began in 1978, the other two being Oman's Arabian Oryx Sanctuary in 2007 and the Dresden Elbe Valley in Germany in 2009. Proposal to remove World Heritage status 'painful' Australia angered by Great Barrier Reef report Everton cleared to build new Â£500m stadium Announcing the decision, the committee chairman said 20 votes had been cast - with 13 in favour of deleting the city, five against the proposal and two ballot papers being invalid. Liverpool's Liberal Democrat leader Richard Kempsaid it was a ""day of shame"" for the city,,externaladding that it would ""without a doubt, affect our tourism and inward investment"". This video can not be played City's heritage status loss ""a real shame"" The city was awarded the much-coveted title in 2004 in recognition of its historical and architectural impact, joining places including the Taj Mahal, Egypt's Pyramids and Canterbury Cathedral. It recognised its history as a major trading centre during the British Empire and its architectural landmarks. However, a report in June by the World Heritage Committee said developments on the city's waterfront had resulted in ""irreversible loss of attributes"". It cited theLiverpool Waters projectandEverton's new stadium, which is being built at Bramley Moore Dock. Chris Capes, director of development for Peel L&P's Liverpool Waters, said he was disappointed ""particularly given the considerable investment that the city has put into protecting and improving its heritage sites"". Everton have agreed to invest up to Â£55m to ""preserve, restore and celebrate the heritage assets"" of the area as part of its stadium plan. They project was approved following two public consultations, with the second survey attracting more than 40,000 people. The club found 98% of people supported the proposed design of the stadium, while 96% backed the club's plans for historic features on the site. By Claire Hamilton, BBC Radio Merseyside political reporter Liverpool has seen more peaks and troughs than most, and it's a city which has changed immeasurably since 2004 when the World Heritage Status was conferred. Back then, there was no Liverpool One shopping centre, no hint that Everton would consider building a multi-million pound waterfront stadium and its year as European Capital of Culture hadn't happened. The city has changed. Today, there's a sense of defiance in some quarters about Unesco's decision that the city doesn't need the title, especially if sits in the way of progress for an area which has lain neglected and semi derelict for decades. Critics argue the benefits of being a World Heritage status were never properly spelled out and there wasn't the political will in the city to address Unesco's concerns until recently, when it was too late. Many people argue that tourists visiting the Pier Head, St George's Plateau or Penny Lane are not coming because Liverpool is a designated World Heritage site - they probably don't even realise it is. They're coming for the Beatles, the football, food and the history but that history will remain. Yet today's announcement worries those who fear that the ability to protect heritage, architecture and history is now diminished, that there will be a free-for-all of unsuitable, careless development. The argument for the last decade has been presented as a binary choice: heritage or progress? The feeling in Liverpool is, couldn't we have had both? Dr David Jeffery hopes the decision will act as a warning to the council Dr David Jeffery, who is a lecturer of British politics at the University of Liverpool, said he believed the decision would not have a ""serious impact"" on the city's tourism industry. ""I do hope this serves as a warning to the council to stop approving ugly buildings though,"" he said. Wayne Colquhoun, who has campaigned for 15 years to keep Liverpool's heritage status, said he was ""devastated"" by the news. ""It's the status symbol that has put us up there with the Great Wall of China and the pyramids and now it has gone,"" he said. ""You've got to be clever being a World Heritage city and be able to take traditional materials and build them in a modern manner."" Wayne Colquhoun said the decision would ""stop people thinking that we are up there with the greatest cities on Earth"" Richie Wright, 40, who has lived in Liverpool all his life, said the status had ""on many occasions, hampered and restricted development in a city that is ripe for development"". ""I hope that Liverpool and its wider city region now seizes this opportunity to make common sense decisions that make our city and the world proud,"" he said.

"People buying flats in buildings lower than 18m (59ft) in England will no longer have to provide safety details on external walls to get a mortgage, the government has said. Barclays, HSBC and Lloyds welcomed the change, and said it should pave the way for updated industry guidance. It follows concerns over large bills to remove cladding facing many flat owners since the Grenfell Tower fire. But Labour called the height-based stipulation ""arbitrary"". Homeowners to get 15 years to sue shoddy builders What makes cladding unsafe and what are your rights? Grenfell survivors condemn new fire safety laws What makes cladding unsafe and what are your rights? After the 2017 fire in Grenfell Tower, west London, in which 72 people died, thousands of blocks of flats were found to be covered in similar dangerous cladding. Work to remove the material, as well as fix other safety issues, meant many residents were charged thousands of pounds, often leaving them in negative equity and unable to sell their property. Mortgage lenders began asking for assurances on the safety of external wall systems as a condition of approving mortgage applications. Mortgage applicants were asked to get safety assessors to sign off a form - known as EWS1 - to prove their property is safe. Lenders have been asking for the forms for many different types of buildings, including those without cladding. To begin with, only those who owned flats in tall buildings with dangerous flammable cladding were affected. After the government extended its advice to smaller properties in January 2020, mortgage lenders began demanding fire surveys from a much wider range of sellers. But on Wednesday, Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick said this guidance would now be changed to exempt leaseholders in low-to-medium-rise blocks from this requirement. He said the change followed new advice from fire safety experts commissioned by the government earlier this year. Home fires were at an all-time low, he said, while 91% occurred in houses, bungalows or converted flats. By BBC business presenter Sarah Corker This is an attempt to unlock parts of the property market that have been paralysed by the cladding crisis. It's estimated that up to 3 million flats have been left unsellable because lenders are demanding an EWS1 form. It's left people in low and mid-rise buildings, where the safety risks are deemed as low, unable to move with properties valued at zero. Even blocks with no cladding have been affected. The problem has been compounded by a shortage of fire engineers to carry out the checks and flat-owners have faced long delays obtaining the paperwork. There is an acceptance too that ""extreme risk aversion"" from lenders, insurers, and the wider property industry has resulted in flat-owners across the UK receiving massive bills for work that is not necessary. Lenders have now committed to review their practices on this, but the response from leaseholders has so far been muted. They are waiting for banks to actually change their policies - only then will this policy make a real difference to those caught up in the cladding scandal. Mr Jenrick also said: ""In the small number of cases [in purpose-built tower blocks below 18m] where there are known to be concerns these should be addressed primarily through risk management and mitigation."" He added: ""Fire-risk assessors and lenders should not presume that there is significant risk to life unless there is evidence to support this. ""This would ensure that they respond only to the evidence and adopt a far more proportionate and balanced approach."" Mr Jenrick said he was pleased major lenders had agreed to change their rules, adding: ""I hope and expect other lenders to follow suit swiftly."" The change, which will apply only in England, would influence mortgage lenders' attitudes across the UK, he added. For Labour, shadow housing secretary Lucy Powell said there was a ""cosy relationship between developers and the private inspectors they handsomely pay"". She added: ""The government should think again about its arbitrary definition of high-risk buildings.""

"This video can not be played Border Force officers pick up migrants in the Channel Home Secretary Priti Patel has defended a new Â£54.2m deal with France to stem the rising number of migrants crossing the English Channel. The number of people crossing the Channel this year is now more than the total for all of 2020. She denied it was ""sending good money after bad"" after a Â£28.2m deal last November failed to limit crossings. Calais MP Pierre-Henri Dumont suggested it would not have an impact as the French coastline is too long to patrol. Giving evidence to the Home Affairs Committee, Ms Patel said it was an ""evolving situation"", with the numbers of those attempting the crossing having ""increased considerably"". On Monday at least 430 migrants crossed the Channel - a record for one day. The previous daily high of 416was set in September last year. And on Wednesday, a group of migrants was seen arriving at Dover, bringing the total number this year to more than the 8,461 who made the crossing in 2020. The group included at least five children, according to reports. Record 430 migrants cross Channel in single day What happens to migrants who reach the UK? June sees record number of Channel migrants arrive The deal agreed on Tuesday between London and Paris will see France double the number of police patrolling its beaches. It will also fund improved intelligence sharing and introduce better technology to target the gangs who organise the crossings. But some have questioned whether it will have an impact. By BBC home editor Mark Easton, in Kent Boys sleep on the floor in one holding centre in Kent The terrace of the Stade hotel, on the seafront in Hythe, is festooned by England flags. But its usual summer guests have been told their holidays there are cancelled. The hotel's owner says it has been block booked for 68 days by the Home Office - at an irresistible price to him of Â£5,000 a day. The occupants are young men who tell us - from their balconies - that they are 16 or 17 and from Iran. One has been there 11 days and they aren't allowed to leave their rooms. Between 15 and 20 unaccompanied migrant children are currently accommodated in a government office building, Frontier House in Folkestone, in sleeping bags on camp beds and reportedly without proper washing facilities or medical support.  One agency has warned that the children's welfare is deteriorating. The BBC has obtained photographs of conditions in one holding centre that show young boys sleeping on the floor with cushions for pillows and military-style camp-beds, trying to get some rest in what looks like an office waiting room. Kent County Council has for a second year said it is unable to care for any more unaccompanied child asylum seekers. It is currently looking after 358 of them. Conservative MP Tim Loughton said ""giving the French more money to carry on doing what they're doing badly is not going to solve the problem."" The home secretary said there had been a ""complete change in modus operandi in terms of the crossings"", with a ""widespread dispersal"" of launches of small boats ""along the whole French coastline"" rather than people just coming from Calais. She said France had intercepted more boats than they did this time last year, because the numbers are ""so high"" and are ""going up."" And she stressed that France would ""argue they are doing their bit"" but said they have a ""different interpretation"" of how to save lives at sea. Border Force director general Paul Lincoln said last year France had made more than 2,100 interceptions of boats last year, while this year the figure was now over 6,000. Calais MP Mr Dumont has suggested the new deal would not have an impact as the French coastline is too big. He told the Today programme: ""The fact is, we've seen it before. Having more money, having more police officers, having more controls, will not prevent people to succeed in these crossing attempts. ""We have too many kilometres of shore to monitor."" Mr Dumont added that the French are not supposed to intervene at sea - yet former Border Force chief Tony Smith has called for joint patrols. Mr Smith said: ""That seems to be a step too far for the French at the moment. The French position is they are not prepared to intervene on the high seas, only on land."" An RNLI lifeboat assisting with the arrival of a small boat on Wednesday Ms Patel and French interior minister Gerald Darmanin have agreed to ""strengthen co-operation"" over the crossings. She told the Home Affairs Committee she had discussed with the French their obligations are under international law to return migrants trying to cross the Channel to their territory. She added they were looking at everything that could be done to save lives at sea, saying of the French: ""They absolutely know what their responsibilities are."" The Home Office said UK support last year helped France double the number of officers deployed daily on the beaches of its northern coast. The new support announced by the UK would enable France ""to respond by posting more security forces further up the coast, installing and utilising the latest surveillance equipment throughout northern France"", the Home Office said. Analysis by Simon Jones, BBC reporter, in Dover From the famous White Cliffs of Dover, we watched this morning as another group of migrants was brought to shore by the Border Force, having been picked up in the Channel. Conditions at sea are once again incredibly calm and the sun is shining, so these are unlikely to be the only arrivals today. Almost 1,000 people have reached the UK by boat in the past three days, putting pressure on the home secretary to act. Priti Patel is now pledging more money to the French authorities to try to prevent the crossings. But the deal struck last night is very similar to one agreed between Britain and France last November - which has failed to stem the numbers arriving, though the Home Office points out the number of crossings being prevented by the French authorities has doubled. The government here accepts there is no quick and easy fix to problems with the asylum system, but there's no doubt the home secretary will want to see swift results in return for the increased investment in northern France. Ms Patel has previously pledged to make Channel crossings ""unviable"", with new legislation that will make it a crime to knowingly arrive in the UK without permission. The Nationality and Borders Bill, which is currently being considered by MPs, will mean migrants entering without permission could face up to four years in prison. The government hopes the overhaul of asylum rules will deter migrants from making the crossing. There are dozens of small boats in storage in Dover But the plans have been criticised by charities including Refugee Action, which has called them ""extreme and nasty"". Amnesty International's Steve Valdez-Symonds told the BBC the new legislation was an ""extremely reckless and dangerous response"" to the issue and would not tackle the problem of people smugglers. Labour shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said the Home Office announcement was ""yet more empty words from the Conservatives about agreeing a deal with France to address trafficking gangs"". Number 10 said the government was ""doing two things in parallel"" to tackle migrant crossings.

"Andrew Dymock had denied 15 offences relating to terrorism and hatred A neo-Nazi student who created two extremist groups and promoted a ""distorted and wicked cause"" has been jailed. Andrew Dymock, 24, from Bath, led the outlawed groups System Resistance Network (SRN) and Sonnenkrieg Division. A judge said Dymock was ""driven by an extremist mindset"" and had taken the path of ""total hatred and bigotry"". He was convicted of 15 offences and jailed for seven years, with a further three years on extended licence. Dymock's trial in June heard he used the SRN website and a Twitter account to state thatJewish people should be exterminatedand encourage lone actor terror attacks. He advocated for societal collapse and a race war, and called for gay peopleto be ""purged"" from society. Jurors were shown this image of Dymock during his trial Judge Mark Dennis QC, sitting at The Old Bailey, said he believed Dymock was dangerous and posed a ""significant risk of serious harm"" to the public. ""It is clear you were a leader and not a follower,"" he said. He added Dymock was an ""intelligent, well-read"" person but also ""wholly misguided"". The court had heard Dymock wrote an online article stating a ""racial holy war is inevitable"" and that ""every stabbing, bombing, shooting further plays into our hands"". The neo-Nazi given away by his rainbow sheets He was expelled from SRN in late February 2018 and arrested in June of that year at Gatwick Airport, as he tried to board a flight to the US. In his luggage police found extreme right-wing literature including Siege, an anthology of pro-Nazi essays written by James Mason, and Mein Kampf, along with clothing bearing neo-Nazi logos. Images taken from SRN videos were shown to jurors Judge Dennis said: ""Despite all the advantages of a good education and family upbringing you chose, at the age of 20, to take the path of dreadful bigotry, intolerance and hatred towards other members of our society solely on the basis of their race, creed or sexual orientation. ""In setting up and running the website and Twitter account for your extremist cause, you were prepared to inflame such vile prejudices in others and to promote and encourage hatred and violence towards other human beings in furtherance of your distorted and wicked cause."" The former student had been supported throughout his trial by his parents, Stella and Dr David Dymock, a professor of dentistry at Bristol University, who he lived with. The court heard they had written to the judge asking for leniency ahead of the sentencing. Defence lawyer Andrew Morris said they were ""extremely worried"" about the impact of jail on their son. Dymock told jurors ""thank you for killing me"" when he was convicted Dymock, who at the time was studying politics at Aberystwyth University in Wales, denied being behind the SRN accounts, claiming he wasset up by an ex-girlfriend, who had failed to recruit him to join banned terrorist group National Action (NA). He denied being a neo-Nazi and told police: ""In fact, I am bisexual but lean towards being homosexual, in direct conflict with Nazism."" He was found guilty of five charges of encouraging terrorism, two of fundraising for terrorism, four counts of disseminating terrorist publications, possessing a terrorist document, stirring up racial hatred and hatred based on sexual orientation, and possessing racially inflammatory material. Dymock's trial was shown images of him performing nazi salutes and holding extremist flags Det Chf Supt Martin Snowden, head of Counter Terrorism Policing North East, which led the investigation into Dymock, said: ""Dymock represented a threat to our society, not simply because of his mindset but because of the considerable efforts he exerted spreading his ideology and misusing his abilities.""

"This video can not be played Commuters and children rescued from China floodwaters Twelve people have died after record-breaking rainfall flooded underground railway tunnels in China, leaving passengers trapped in rising waters. Video shared on social media shows evening commuters just managing to keep their heads above water. Water is seen rushing onto platforms. More than 500 people were eventually rescued from the tunnels in Henan province, officials said. Days of rain have caused widespread damage and led to 200,000 evacuations. Above ground, roads have been turned into rivers, with cars and debris swept along in fast moving currents. A number ofpedestrians have had to be rescued. In total, 25 people have died in Henan province and more than a dozen cities are affected. President Xi Jinping said on Wednesday that there had been ""significant loss of life and damage to property"". Several dams and reservoirs have breached warning levels, and soldiers have been mobilised to divert rivers which have burst their banks. Flights and trains in many parts of Henan have also been suspended. In the provincial capital  Zhengzhou, the equivalent of a year's average rainfall has fallen in just three days. On Tuesday, some of the city's flood defences were overwhelmed and water began flowing down into the railway tunnels. Survivors have described how water leaked through the doors, rising slowly from ""our ankles to our knees to our necks"". ""All of us who could, stood on the subway seats,"" one woman wrote on Chinese social network site Weibo. Science failed to predict flood and heat intensity Record heat points to 'extraordinary' extremes Children were lifted out of the water by their parents, while others threw off anything which might hold them down. After about half an hour, one passenger said it became ""hard to breathe"". An order to shut down the line came at 18:10 local time (10:10 GMT) so the evacuation could begin, Zhengzhou government officials said in a statement. Five people are being treated for injuries, with 12 having died. Elsewhere in the central Chinese city, children had to be rescued from a flooded nursery school. State media aired footage of them being floated out in plastic tubs by rescuers. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou Hospital also briefly lost power on Tuesday night, though this has now been restored, said a statement on Weibo by the Zhengzhou Municipal Party Committee. It added that 600 critically ill patients had been transferred to another location. Another resident, identified as Mr Liu, 27, told BBC Chinese he had had ""no water, no electricity, and no internet"". ""Never in my life had I seen so much rain,"" Mr Liu added. ""There was one hour where the rain was just pouring down on us from the heavens, and everything went completely white."" But the rising waters were not just confined to Zhengzhou. A 20-metre (65ft) breach has emerged in the dam in Luoyang city after it was damaged by storms, officials said. Soldiers have been deployed to the area and a statement from the army warned it could ""collapse at any time"". Another user said that residents in Sishui town were stuck on rooftops. ""We don't know how to swimâ¦ the whole village is about to be washed away,"" the person wrote. Henan has experienced ""rare and severe rainfall"" since Saturday, China's meteorological authority said on Wednesday. Zhengzhou saw 624mm of rainfall on Tuesday, with a third of that amount falling between 16:00 and 17:00 alone, which ""smashed historical records"". It forecasted that parts of the region would continue to see ""severe or extremely severe storms"" and that the heavy rain was likely to end only on Thursday. Many factors contribute to flooding, but a warming atmosphere caused by climate change makes extreme rainfall more likely. Part of the Yellow River basin in China, Henan has several major river systems running through the province which are prone to flooding. Zhengzhou, which has a population of 12 million, sits on the banks of the Yellow River itself. Scientists have warned that widespread dam construction has exacerbated climate change problems in China's flood zone, says the BBC's China correspondent Stephen McDonell. Connections between rivers and lakes have been cut and disrupted flood plains which once absorbed much of the region's annual summer downpours.

"Harvey Weinstein is currently serving a 23-year prison sentence in New York Disgraced Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein has pleaded not guilty to rape and sexual assault charges in a Los Angeles court. He appeared in court in a wheelchair after being extradited from New York, where he is serving a23-year jail sentencefor similar crimes. The 69-year-old faces 11 counts of sexual assault in California relating to alleged incidents with five women. He maintains his innocence and has said any sexual activity was consensual. The incidents are said to have occurred in hotels in Beverly Hills and Los Angeles between 2004 and 2013. The charges include forcible rape, forcible oral copulation, sexual battery by restraint, and sexual penetration by use of force. If convicted, Weinstein could face a maximum sentence of 140 years. Wearing brown prison overalls and a face mask, Weinstein only spoke only to say ""thank you"" to Judge Sergio Tapia after she wished him ""good luck"". His lawyer said the charges were not credible. ""They are baseless, they are from long, long ago, they are uncorroborated,"" Mark Werksman said after the hearing. Weinstein is appealing against last year's conviction in New York. More than 80 women have accused him of sexual misconduct, and some of the accusations date back several decades. Allegations reported in 2017 contributed to the rise of the #MeToo movement, which encouraged people to share experiences of sexual harassment and assault. However, very few of the allegations have led to criminal charges. The pandemic and procedural delays meantWeinstein's extradition to California took well over a year. During the hearing, Mr Werksman requested the former movie mogul have a health examination. ""He's going blind in one eye,"" he told reporters. Weinstein has produced several hit movies including Shakespeare in Love, which won the Oscar for best picture in 1999. Follow us onFacebook,external, or on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external.

"Dad Mike had suffered from poor mental health after suffering a bereavement Mike acknowledges many people would be able to cope better than him with grief, the stresses of work and financial pressure. Throw in ""a toxic relationship, plus drink and drugs"" and the father from Newport is ashamed of his actions. He served three prison sentences for domestic violence, but a project has helped turn his life around. ""I can only imagine how it must have affected my exes,"" he said. The Barnardo's Cymru scheme is the first to work with perpetrators of domestic abuse, victims and their children. Mike is in his early 30s and said his mental health deteriorated after he suffered a bereavement. Domestic abuse 'became normal part of life' 'My boyfriend held me under hot water in lockdown' Domestic abuse an 'epidemic beneath a pandemic' ""I'd get stressed out with day-to-day life stuff - working all the time, money issues,"" he said. ""And where a normal person will get on with it, if you put a toxic relationship and drink and drugs into the mix, it all blows up. It wasn't healthy."" Mike now has a son and says he is ""like the reward I get for turning my life around"" He added: ""There was domestic abuse on my part, and I ended up doing a couple of prison sentences. I wouldn't let my father come in and see me in prison because I was ashamed. ""I can only imagine how it must have affected my exes. Even though we were both into drugs and drink, they trusted me. ""For me to break that trust because of my own mixed-up mental state must have been heart-breaking for them. ""It wasn't until my last sentence that I had time to straighten out my head. Being in prison, being stuck behind that door, it gives you a lot of thinking time and I just had to better myself. ""I did a few courses in prison and picked up a few tools that helped me deal with things. This course [with Barnardo's] was like a refresher - I also learnt a lot more. There's no judgement, they don't hold anything against me. ""Every relationship has little niggles, but we can read each other like a book, we both know when to give each other a bit of space."" Mike has recently had his first child with his new partner, Emma - we've changed both their names to protect their children. While theirs is a healthy relationship, Emma previously experienced domestic abuse with the father of her older children, who were taken into care as a result of the violence at home. ""All I ever wanted was for them to be children,"" she said. Mike and his partner Emma have a young son ""Caring for them was no problem but trying to stop them seeing the stuff they shouldn't see - domestic abuse, physical, verbal - it was hard. Especially when the perpetrator only wanted to do it in front of the children. ""I found myself begging for him to stop, but I think he thrived off seeing me panic. ""You feel like it's your fault. How could I have let myself be so weak? How can the father of my children do that to me and to them?"" She explained the turning point came when she started being honest with her social workers about what was going on, as she'd previously tried to protect her children by dealing with it alone. ""I've come through it with help and support from this project. I'm not a victim anymore, I'm a survivor,"" said Emma. ""There's never been any domestic abuse between me and my partner, but he's obviously had situations like that in the past. ""He has techniques now, and knows support is there. It gives me that confidence that I'll never have to be frightened again. And I know what to look out for, how to deal with it, what to do, who to call."" Since completing the opening ""Closed Doors"" project with Barnardo's Cymru, Emma and Mike's baby is no longer on a child-protection plan with their local social services and Emma hopes one day to have her older children back home. ""[Barnardo's] have worked brilliantly with my kids,"" she said. ""My son is a different child. It makes me happy how happy they are now, because they're not in an environment that's bad for them."" Mike added: ""My little boy is a blessing. I'd go to the end of the world for him. He's like the reward I get for turning my life around and motivation to keep everything on track. ""Now, I've got little eyes on me and I've got to make sure I set a good example for him."" The project has been given funding for a second year by the Home Office and has worked with more than 500 families across Newport, Blaenau Gwent, Torfaen, Monmouthshire and Caerphilly. Results show three-quarters of the children are now in safer, more stable homes. An evaluation by the Institute of Care at Oxford Brookes University found it had a positive impact on families. In almost half of cases, involvement from social services had been reduced - and 95% of children's case files showed improvement in their emotional health and wellbeing. Feedback from parents noted children were less angry, aggressive or violent, while some no longer ran away, wet the bed or self-harmed. Barnardo's Cymru support worker Georgia Lagden has been helping the family The report said recovery is likely to be a long and complex process over a number of years rather than months, but the scheme was worth investing in and rolled out further. Georgia Lagden works as a support worker for perpetrators with Barnardo's Cymru and explained that not all men want to engage at first. ""Some of them are in desperate times and want that support. Then I work with some guys who will ignore that it's happening - it's a denial process. ""We like to get to know people - these behaviours are learnt somewhere; these people don't just become violent or abusive or controlling and we recognise that. ""If they've had childhood trauma - that's quite often the case - we can focus on that and look at how they felt as a child and explain we don't want their children to feel like this. That can be their lightbulb moment."" As many will also struggle with poor mental health or substance use, a number of factors will have to be addressed. Barnardo's Cymru victim support worker Sam Jenkins says they've seen a lot of changes in Mike ""It's a vital service for all the families that get referred to us,"" she said. Sam Jenkins is one of the team supporting the victims. ""We see lots of changes,"" he said. ""Confidence, self-esteem, better decision-making, more independence and freedom. ""It depends on the situation, but some couples stay together and their relationship improves, some people decide they don't want to be in that relationship anymore and move on but we do see a lot of positive outcomes.""

"NHS staff in England will be given a 3% pay rise backdated to April. It had previously been suggested that nurses, health assistants and other NHS staffwould only be given a 1% increaseto their salaries. When defending the proposed 1% increase in March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson described it as ""as much as we can at the present time"". However, the government now says: ""The economy is actually doing better than we anticipated four months ago"". At the start of the year, the International Monetary Fund predicted that the British economy would grow by 4.5% in 2021. Following the vaccine programme and the reopening of businesses, they now expect the UK economy to grow by 5.3% this year. The Bank of England expects the economy to grow by 7.25%, which would be the fastest growth in more than 70 years. According to the Office for National Statistics, the government received Â£62.2bn in taxes in June compared with Â£46.2bn in February. But in June alone, the government also borrowed Â£22.8bn and spent Â£8.7bn on interest payments after a year and a half of record borrowing. However, the prime minister's spokesman says the pay rise won't come from borrowing. ""It will be funded from within the NHS budget but we're very clear it won't impact frontline services."" Around half of all public-sector workers, including NHS staff, police officers and teachers, have their salaries negotiated by independent pay-review bodies. These pay bodies - made up of individuals not directly attached to the relevant department but with experience in economics and employee relations - work with government departments, unions and other groups to come up with a recommendation on how pay should change each year. NHS workers in England offered 3% pay rise What are key workers paid? 11 charts on what's happened to the NHS This recommendation is non-binding - meaning ultimately the government decides. In November 2020,the government announcedthat public-sector workers would have their pay frozen in 2021-22. The exception was for those on salaries under Â£24,000 and for NHS staff. It was initially recommended, by the Department for Health and Social Care (DHSC), that pay should rise by just 1% for 2021-22. The DHSC cited the ""uncertain"" financial situation and low inflation. It also said anything more than 1% would require ""reprioritisation"" of the NHS budget. But inflation has risen significantly since March. In June, it reached 2.5% -the highest it has beenfor nearly three years. On 9 March, the head of NHS England,Sir Simon Stevens, told a committee of MPsthat the health service's long-term plan - published in 2019 - had assumed a 2.1% increase this year. But he said ""things have changed"" since then, and said it should now be up to the pay-review body. The pay-review body takes evidence from other groups, including unions and NHS bodies, and will have done its own calculations before making its recommendation. On 21 July the government announced it would accept the pay review bodies' recommendations in full this year, giving NHS staff a 3% pay rise. In theory,the pay-review bodies make recommendations,externalfor all staff across the UK. However, it is up to the individual UK nations to decide whether to accept them. In Scotland,NHS staff have been offered a 4% pay rise(backdated to December 2020). This follows a one-off Covid payment for health and social care staff of Â£500. The Welsh government has said all of its NHS staffwill receive a 3% pay rise. In 2010-11, it was decided that pay would be frozen for all public-sector workers as part of government austerity measures. Strict pay freezes or pay caps were implemented until 2018-19, when the government removed these limits and a three-year pay agreement was implemented for NHS staff in England. But the impact of inflation means that over the whole period some salaries are worth less than they were a decade ago. What is the UK's inflation rate? For example, a newly qualified nurse starting in 2020-21 would be earning about 3% less than one who started in 2010-11, once we account for inflation and the impact of pay freezes and caps. Nurses are just one part of the NHS workforce and the pay agreement implemented in 2018-19 affected different staff members in different ways. For example, the agreement meant the wages of those in the very lowest pay band, such as housekeeping or security staff, increased by almost 30% over the past three years. Staff at the top of their pay bands would have had a smaller pay increase. And it's important to point out that the pay of many NHS staff increases as their experience grows and they move up within pay bands. What claims do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

The hail storm hit Kibworth Beauchamp village in Leicestershire at about 18:15 BST on Tuesday. Resident Katie Jaffar said the storm was ""terrifying"" and left her car ""covered in golf ball-sized dents"". Several roads in the East of England also flooded as temperatures of 30C (85F) turned to heavy rain and hail. The Met Office had earlier issued ayellow warning for thunderstorms,external. The giant hail put an end to a day of fun in the sun for many as they counted the cost of the damage Journalist and mother-of-two Mrs Jaffar, 46, said: ""One minute the kids were playing with their friends in the paddling pool and it was gloriously hot. ""The next minute huge dollops of rain started falling and then it turned into hail - giant lumps of it thundering down. ""It was so fast, it was pretty terrifying."" Latest news and stories from the East Midlands Kibworth Court care home had to move all residents to the first floor after two lounges, the dining room and reception flooded. Manager Caroline Harrison said: ""We were watching it with the residents because it was massive hailstones, and we realised it was actually getting really close to the front door, and then all of a sudden it just [came] straight through all the windows. ""We had to get the residents upstairs [and] phoned the fire brigade, because by then we were under at least eight inches of water. ""They came out and pumped the car park - the car park was like a massive pond."" One resident estimated the size of the hail to be three to five centimetres Ms Harrison said staff had worked through the night to clean up and were ""all pretty exhausted"" and ""grateful"" to villagers who dropped off towels and helped after an appeal on Facebook. ""Most of the staff came in to help us have a massive clean-up last night - we've been here all night,"" she added. ""We've lost all the carpet - it's not something I want to go through again. ""The back garden is absolutely devastated. The gazebos all have holes in them, the umbrellas have gone. ""The devastation's pretty gutting."" A number of people compared the hailstones to items in their homes By Anna Church, BBC East Midlands Today senior weather presenter Although hail is not unusual in the summer, the size of it experienced in Kibworth and surrounding areas on Tuesday is uncommon. It formed due to a number of factors. The atmosphere was highly unstable across the region yesterday, which led to strong updrafts in the cloud, allowing the hail longer to form and therefore get bigger. The instability was also deep, with a large area of cloud above freezing. The hail accompanied thunderstorms, which also caused flash flooding in places. A number of cars took damage during the storm Kevin Messenger's car window was taken out Several Twitter users posted videos of the torrential showers, pictures of the giant hail and smashed car windows. One Kibworth resident, who did not want to be named, said every car in the village would have been damaged if it was not in a garage or under cover. ""They were huge boulders coming from the sky, it was unbelievable,"" she said. ""I know a lot of people that have had their cars damaged. My car and partner's van were hit, my mother-in-law's greenhouse and window sill on the conservatory have boulder-sized holes in them. ""It felt like it lasted over an hour and a half, it was freaky."" A greenhouse was hit during the storm Kevin Messenger saw his car damaged by the storm. ""It was a surreal experience to be honest,"" he told BBC Radio Leicester. ""One minute you are basking in the glorious sunshine, and then a little bit of rain started and all of a sudden the noise started echoing around the house. ""I woke up this morning almost feeling a bit fortunate and a bit grateful - [there are] definitely worse-impacted people than me."" Primary school teacher Phil Morrish, 53, who is an avid weather watcher, said he was sent pictures from friends in Kibworth village. ""People are shocked by it,"" he said. ""There are quite a few cars being damaged by this huge hail. ""It is crazy weather. The hailstones are three to five centimetres big."" Paul Arscott, a market researcher and father-of-two from Kibworth, said: ""The roads were nuts. ""Everyone pulled up on grass verges and pavements trying to hide under trees or bridges from the A6 all the way to Kibworth, all at different angles. It was like a scene from an Armageddon film."" Many car windscreens were damaged Joe Starmer, who runs a nearby car body repair shop, said he had received several calls on Wednesday morning from residents. ""I only live down the road from Kibworth and my workshop wasn't affected - we just got rain,"" he said. ""But I drove down and it's not a good look. Pretty much every car I drove past was affected - the roof panels and bonnets broken, windscreens smashed, every single panel dented."" Kibworth Golf Club said it would be closed all day on Wednesday because of damage to the course. Club secretary Wendy Quilter said members and volunteers had been down with rakes and brushes to help with the clean-up. ""All the grounds are dimpled and waterlogged... the skylights around the clubhouse smashed, guttering demolished, there's not a flower left in the place,"" she said. ""I have never seen anything quite like it."" There was flooding in Kibworth village after the downpour Elderly residents on the upper floor of retirement home Morrison Court, in Kibworth, were evacuated by fire crews after several skylights were shattered and water started flowing into the corridors. One of the residents, Andrea Smith, 75, said: ""It was horrifying. Water started coming through the lights in the corridor ceilings and it forced them to crash to the ground with live electric wires hanging down. ""One of the ladies who lives here nearly got smashed on the head with one of these lights - it fell down just in front of her. ""It was really scary because it was so noisy. It sounded like gunshots. There was glass everywhere."" Officers closed the A6 Harborough Road, at Kibworth, in both directions due to flooding. Leicestershire Police said it was ""dealing with an incident"" and advised motorists to find alternative routes. Leicestershire Fire and Rescue Service has warned people not to ""attempt to drive through flood water"".

A new team will be back tomorrow - in the meantime, you can find any significant developments on ourmain news pages. We're drawing our live coverage of coronavirus developments to a close. Let's re-cap what happened in the UK: France has introduced a new health pass for some venues and public spaces The Delta variant spreads, France rolls out its Covid health
pass and Australians brace for more lockdowns. Here are the Covid headlines
from around the world: Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Authorities in Nanjing announced city-wide testing on Wednesday Part of a
major Chinese city has today gone into lockdown, after 17 airport workers
tested positive. According to
Chinaâs officialXinhua News Agency,external, employees at Nanjingâs Lukou International
Airport have tested positive. Nine of those are symptomatic. Flights have
subsequently been cancelled and 500 people have been placed under medical
observation. The local government today announced a citywide testing drive,
which will cover 9.3 million people. Four communities and villages in the city
have now become âmedium riskâ, meaning that local lockdown measures are in
place. Nanjing, in
eastern Jiangsu, is now one of two Chinese cities where there are lockdown
measures in place. There has been an outbreak since early July at the opposite
end of the country in a city called Ruili, which borders Myanmar. There are more
than 200 people currently in hospital in Yunnan province, many in the city of
Ruili. Today, a new testing drive has also been ordered there. Residents in
Ruili have already experienced multiple testing drives throughout the pandemic,
as the city has experienced four waves of the coronavirus. It has a population
of some 270,000 people. This video can not be played Inside India's deadly mucormycosis fungus epidemic Mucormycosis, a rare and deadly infection known as ""black fungus"", has killed more than 4,300 people in India, the health ministry has reported. The country has recorded 45,374 cases of the illness. Doctors say the fungus has a link with the steroids used to treat Covid, and diabetics are at particular risk. But the scale of the problem could be even greater. Dr Raghuraj Hegde, a Bangalore-based eye surgeon who has treated a number of mucormycosis patients, told the BBC that there had been ""massive undercounting of both cases and deaths"" from the disease. ""Typically, deaths in mucormycosis occur weeks to months after getting the disease. Our present systems are not good to capture that data,"" he said. You can read more about ithere Uptake of the coronavirus vaccine has been lower among ethnic minorities in Scotland, with African groups having the lowest levels of inoculation, the latest data shows. Rates are also lower among Asian Scots and those of Black or Caribbean heritage, figures from Public Health Scotland show. Other studies have found similarly lower levels of vaccination among ethnic minorities elsewhere in the UK. In Scotland, the difference has been most apparent in the 70 to 74 age range, where first dose uptake is 97.2% for the white ethnic group and 73.7% for the African ethnic group. For the Asian group in this age range, uptake was at 89.7% while the figure for Black or Caribbean Scots was 93.8%. While uptake was high in all age ranges among white Scots, it varied considerably among Black or Caribbean Scots, with uptake ranging from 96.0% in the over 80s to 46.0% in those aged 18-29 years. A further 44,104 people have tested positive for the coronavirus across the UK,government figures,externalshow. Another 73 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were also reported.  Over 39,000 people died of coronavirus in care home settings in England between 10 April 2020 and 31 March this year. Amanda Henry had been unable to see her father Robert, 78, for nearly four weeks - and when she was at last allowed into his care home in Poplar, east London, it was because he was gravely ill. Care homes were struggling to get personal protective equipment and the official guidance they needed. At the time Amanda just wanted to give him some comfort, but even then - in April 2020 - she says she noticed shortcomings with personal protective equipment (PPE). There was not enough of it, it was flimsy, and staff were not using it properly, she claims. Staff were going from room to room, not changing their PPE, not washing their hands between rooms, and some had no PPE at all, she says. ""What I was witnessing was the virus being spread amongst the residents of the care home in real time... ""I feel it tells us that these vulnerable elderly people were disposable to this government... ""I'm angry, I'm angry that my dad had to suffer like that."" Read morehere. More than 39,000 people died of coronavirus in care homes in England in the year from 10 April 2020 to 31 March 2021, new figures suggest. The numbers, released by the Care Quality Commission (CQC), show how the virus spread across the country. The highest number of deaths in a single care home was 44, while 21 homes had more than 30 Covid-related deaths. ""Every number represents a life lost,"" said Kate Terroni, CQC chief inspector for adult social care. Read morehere. The British Retail Consortium (BRC) has urged the government to ensure staff in stores and suppliers should be allowed to work even if they get an alert to self-isolate. The BRC's Andrew Opie said the ""pingdemic"" meant retailers were finding it difficult to maintain opening hours and keep shelves stocked. ""Government needs to act fast. Retail workers and suppliers, who have played a vital role throughout this pandemic, should be allowed to work provided they are double vaccinated or can show a negative Covid test, to ensure there is no disruption to the public's ability to get food and other goods,"" he said. The boss of Iceland supermarkets and leaders at pub chain Greene King have also called for new rulesto avoid crippling shutdowns. Croatia wants tourists to return, but has imposed mandatory testing rules for some Croatia has been on the UK's green list of countries for travel - the lowest level of restriction - since Monday. You can read about the rules for green, amber and red list countrieshere Croatia however has changed the rules for arrivals from the UK, as well as those from Cyprus and Russia. As of Monday 26 July, all visitors from these countries will need proof of a negative Covid test - regardless of whether they've been vaccinated or have proof of recovery from the virus. Tourism accounts for about 20% of the country's economy. But cases have been rising there over the last 10 days, particularly in areas along the Adriatic Coast. On Wednesday, authorities reported 191 new infections in Croatia. Sir Keir Starmer's self-isolation means four of the country's most senior politicians are now quarantining at home. Last week, Health Secretary Sajid Javid tested positive after feeling unwell, leading Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Chancellor Rishi Sunak to isolate at Chequers - the PM's house in Buckinghamshire -  and Downing Street respectively. It has been reported this week that Javid's positive test has forced a raft of senior No 10 and health department officials to self-isolate. It was initially announced that Johnson and Sunak would avoid having to self-isolate through a pilot daily testing programme, but this decisionwas reversed less than three hours later on Sunday. We know Sir Keir was in the Commons earlier for PMQs so it raises the question: if he goes on to develop Covid, how many other politicians will need to self-isolate? As it is announced Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer is to begin self-isolation after one of his children tested positive for Covid (seeearlier posts), let's re-cap the rules he will need to observe. While many restrictions on daily life have now lifted in England, stay-at-home orders for those in close contact with confirmed coronavirus cases have remained in place. Currently, you must self-isolate for 10 days if you test positive, live with someone who tests positive, are told to isolate by NHS Test and Trace, or someone you live with has symptoms. Some fully vaccinated critical workers in England - including health and care staff - will be able to leave isolation to go to work, even if they are traced as a contact of someone with Covid. But these people are specifically named on a letter from a government department in advance of any potential self-isolation order. Changes to the rules around self-isolation for people who are fully vaccinated are due to begin from 16 August in England. Read more about the current ruleshere. The BBC Proms will go ahead at full capacity this year, with audience members ""strongly encouraged"" to wear masks. They will also be required to provide a negative lateral flow test, a positive PCR test or proof of double vaccination. Promming tickets, where audience members can stand in the arena or gallery areas of the Royal Albert Hall, will also be available on the day of each concert. The 2020 edition featured a reduced orchestra playing to an empty auditorium - with the singers placed in the stalls. The return of the fully-fledged event will feature52 concerts over 44 days featuring 30 orchestras and ensembles, more than 100 soloists and conductors and more than 2,000 musicians. The BBC says: ""The safety of our audiences is our main priority and we are taking every step we can to open the Proms safely without social distancing."" Audience members over the age of 18 will be asked to provide a negative lateral flow test taken within 48 hours of the performance, or evidence of double vaccination provided via the NHS app or a letter provided by the NHS. They can also offer proof of natural immunity based upon a positive PCR test taken within 180 days of the performance. Under 18s will be asked for verbal confirmation from a parent or guardian that they have not received a positive test. The BBC Proms opens on 30 July and runs until 11 September. The news that Sir Keir Starmer has begun self-isolation comes just hours after he described a ""summer of chaos"" amid soaring numbers of people self-isolating at home. Starmer dubbed PM Boris Johnson - who is himself self-isolating in Buckinghamshire - the ""Chequers one"" as he mocked Johnson's isolation on the same week most remaining curbs lifted in England. Speaking in the Commons, Starmer said: ""Everything may be calm from the prime minister's country retreat but back here the truth is we're heading for a summer of chaos."" It is the fourth time Labour leader has self-isolated after coming in close contact with a confirmed Covid case since the pandemic began. Starmer isolated inJanuary,December and September last year after being notified that an associate had tested positive. Given his child's positive test came at lunchtime, Starmer may have to self-isolate until 31 July - potentially throwing into doubt any plans his family might have made for a summer holiday. The House of Commons goes into recess tomorrow. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer is to self-isolate after one of his children tested positive, a spokesman says. ""One of Keir's children tested positive for Covid this lunchtime. In line with the rules, Keir and his family will now be self-isolating,"" they said. ""Keir was already doing daily tests and tested negative this morning. He will continue to take daily tests."" Earlier we told you of some of the big name businesses forced to close or reduce services because of the ""pingdemic"". But it's not just household names affected - smaller businesses have told of the disruption caused when staff have to self-isolate. Mrs Salisbury's Tea Rooms in Maldon, Essex is closed until Saturday as co-owner Mike Bloomfield and five staff - half the workforce - are self-isolating after being in contact with a positive Covid case. He says: ""Luckily everybody is negative [for Covid-19] and doing fine at the moment but we still have to do what we have to do and isolate."" Sean Hughes Sean Hughes, who owns pubs in St Albans, says he has been forced to close The Boot due to one member of staff being contacted by NHS Test and Trace and others being pinged by the app. ""We have reduced hours and closed the kitchen for most of this week until they can come back. ""All tests thus far showing negative on a daily basis. It is a complete mess."" You can read more reaction from businesses ownershere. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Nearly a quarter of Taiwan's population have reportedly received one vaccine dose In the last 24 hours, Taiwan has confirmed 16 new local
cases and five further deaths. It has now been five days that Taiwan has
recorded fewer than 20 local cases. Covid-19 restrictions are set to end on Monday, so in the
next couple of days, the Central Epidemic Command Centre will decide whether or
not to relax indoor and outdoor gathering limits, after two months of near
lockdown. Currently, five people are allowed to gather indoors, and 10
outdoors. Since 20 May, all of Taiwan has been in Level 3
restrictions. This is where all but essential businesses are closed, and
mask-wearing is mandatory. Recently, as cases have eased,some sports and entertainment venues have been allowed to reopen. Vaccination is escalating in Taiwan, so the hope is that
this recent, severe wave of Covid-19 will be the last.Local media report,externalthat
23.5% of Taiwanâs 23.5m population have now had one dose of either AstraZeneca
and Moderna. There are warnings, however, that some vaccinations may have
to be postponed in the coming days, due to multiple typhoon warnings. Thanks to early border closures and strict regulations, Taiwan has kept cases relatively low throughout the pandemic. According to Johns Hopkins University it has recorded 15,453 cases and 773 deaths. Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played Commuters and children rescued from China floodwaters Twelve people have died after record-breaking rainfall flooded underground railway tunnels in China, leaving passengers trapped in rising waters. Video shared on social media shows evening commuters just managing to keep their heads above water. Water is seen rushing onto platforms. More than 500 people were eventually rescued from the tunnels in Henan province, officials said. Days of rain have caused widespread damage and led to 200,000 evacuations. Above ground, roads have been turned into rivers, with cars and debris swept along in fast moving currents. A number ofpedestrians have had to be rescued. In total, 25 people have died in Henan province and more than a dozen cities are affected. President Xi Jinping said on Wednesday that there had been ""significant loss of life and damage to property"". Several dams and reservoirs have breached warning levels, and soldiers have been mobilised to divert rivers which have burst their banks. Flights and trains in many parts of Henan have also been suspended. In the provincial capital  Zhengzhou, the equivalent of a year's average rainfall has fallen in just three days. On Tuesday, some of the city's flood defences were overwhelmed and water began flowing down into the railway tunnels. Survivors have described how water leaked through the doors, rising slowly from ""our ankles to our knees to our necks"". ""All of us who could, stood on the subway seats,"" one woman wrote on Chinese social network site Weibo. Science failed to predict flood and heat intensity Record heat points to 'extraordinary' extremes Children were lifted out of the water by their parents, while others threw off anything which might hold them down. After about half an hour, one passenger said it became ""hard to breathe"". An order to shut down the line came at 18:10 local time (10:10 GMT) so the evacuation could begin, Zhengzhou government officials said in a statement. Five people are being treated for injuries, with 12 having died. Elsewhere in the central Chinese city, children had to be rescued from a flooded nursery school. State media aired footage of them being floated out in plastic tubs by rescuers. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou Hospital also briefly lost power on Tuesday night, though this has now been restored, said a statement on Weibo by the Zhengzhou Municipal Party Committee. It added that 600 critically ill patients had been transferred to another location. Another resident, identified as Mr Liu, 27, told BBC Chinese he had had ""no water, no electricity, and no internet"". ""Never in my life had I seen so much rain,"" Mr Liu added. ""There was one hour where the rain was just pouring down on us from the heavens, and everything went completely white."" But the rising waters were not just confined to Zhengzhou. A 20-metre (65ft) breach has emerged in the dam in Luoyang city after it was damaged by storms, officials said. Soldiers have been deployed to the area and a statement from the army warned it could ""collapse at any time"". Another user said that residents in Sishui town were stuck on rooftops. ""We don't know how to swimâ¦ the whole village is about to be washed away,"" the person wrote. Henan has experienced ""rare and severe rainfall"" since Saturday, China's meteorological authority said on Wednesday. Zhengzhou saw 624mm of rainfall on Tuesday, with a third of that amount falling between 16:00 and 17:00 alone, which ""smashed historical records"". It forecasted that parts of the region would continue to see ""severe or extremely severe storms"" and that the heavy rain was likely to end only on Thursday. Many factors contribute to flooding, but a warming atmosphere caused by climate change makes extreme rainfall more likely. Part of the Yellow River basin in China, Henan has several major river systems running through the province which are prone to flooding. Zhengzhou, which has a population of 12 million, sits on the banks of the Yellow River itself. Scientists have warned that widespread dam construction has exacerbated climate change problems in China's flood zone, says the BBC's China correspondent Stephen McDonell. Connections between rivers and lakes have been cut and disrupted flood plains which once absorbed much of the region's annual summer downpours.

"The vandalised mural was adorned with messages of pride and positivity Thousands of messages left on the Marcus Rashford mural in Manchester are to be removed for safekeeping ahead of heavy rains forecast for the weekend. The heartfelt notes were left on the wall in Withington in a show of solidarity after it was vandalised following England's Euro 2020 exit. They will be removed on Friday and taken to Manchester Central Library. Manchester City Council has previously said it was working onplans to preserve the messages permanently. The wall has become a draw for visitors in recent weeks but council staff have been moved to act as the UK's recent heatwave is due to make way for heavy rains by Saturday. Rashford defends charity deals over profit claims I won't apologise for who I am - Rashford The messages of pride and positivity for Rashford Rashford himself will be asked for his input ""to help create a legacy of love and solidarity"", the council said. Groups from the National Football Museum, the People's History Museum and the University of Manchester will also be involved in the project, although it has not yet been decided precisely how the messages will be displayed. Notes thanked Rashford for his ""kindness and helping those in need"" Rashford said he was ""on the verge of tears"" when he first saw themessages from peoplewho had travelled from across the country. It was defaced with swear words shortly after the Manchester United forward missed a penalty, along with Jadon Sancho and Bukayo Saka, in England's 3-2 penalty shootout defeat. Thehandwritten noteswill be carefully removed in whole sections and then separated later by Manchester Art Gallery and Central Library Archives staff. The city council's deputy leader Luthfur Rahman said: ""We think it's important this shared moment of solidarity is remembered and preserved for future generations.

"The UK has unveiled a new set of demands to redraw the post-Brexit trading arrangements it agreed with the EU for Northern Ireland. The government said border checks on goods from Great Britain it signed up to in the 2019 Brexit divorce deal had proved unsustainable. Brexit Minister Lord Frost said they risked harming business, and were damaging the ""fabric"" of the UK. The EU said it would not agree to renegotiate the terms of the 2019 deal. The checks are included in the Northern Ireland Protocol, a section of the Brexit deal designed to avoid border checks on the island of Ireland. Lord Frost called on the EU to look on the UK's proposals with ""fresh eyes,"" adding: ""We cannot go on as we are."" M&S to cut Christmas products in Northern Ireland No renegotiation on Protocol as UK warns of action DUP leader calls for renegotiation of Brexit deal What is the Northern Ireland Protocol? However, he announced the UK would not be triggering Article 16 of the protocol - which would allow it to suspend parts of the Brexit deal - before talks with Brussels. He added that the government believed using it was justifiable, but said: ""Nevertheless, we have concluded that it is not the right moment to do so."" Lord Frost told the House of Lords there was a ""growing sense in Northern Ireland we have not found the right balance, seen in an ongoing febrile political climate, protests and regrettable instances of occasional disorder"".

"Liverpool's World Heritage status recognised the architectural landmarks on the waterfront Liverpool has been stripped of its World Heritage status after a UN committee found developments threatened the value of the city's waterfront. The decision was made following a secret ballot by the Unesco committee at a meeting in China. Unesco had said that the developments, including the planned new Everton FC stadium, had resulted in a ""serious deterioration"" of the historic site. The decision was described as ""incomprehensible"" by the city's mayor. ""Our World Heritage site has never been in better condition having benefitted from hundreds of millions of pounds of investment across dozens of listed buildings and the public realm,"" Joanne Anderson said. She said she would work with the government to examine whether the city could appeal against the decision, which comes ""a decade after Unesco last visited the city to see it with their own eyes"". This video can not be played The decision was made at a UN meeting in China Liverpool City Region Mayor Steve Rotheram said the decision was ""a retrograde step that does not reflect the reality of what is happening on the ground"". ""Places like Liverpool should not be faced with the binary choice between maintaining heritage status or regenerating left-behind communities and the wealth of jobs and opportunities that come with it,"" he said. Labour's Kim Johnson, MP for Liverpool Riverside, said she remained ""proud of my city and what we've done"". ""People come here because it's amazing city and, while I'm disappointed, as a city we are resilient and we will always fight back."" An artist's impression of Everton's new stadium, which is being built at Bramley Moore Dock The government said it was ""extremely disappointed"" and believes Liverpool still deserves its heritage status ""given the significant role the historic docks and the wider city have played throughout history"". Liverpool becomes only the third site to lose its World Heritage status since the list began in 1978, the other two being Oman's Arabian Oryx Sanctuary in 2007 and the Dresden Elbe Valley in Germany in 2009. Proposal to remove World Heritage status 'painful' Australia angered by Great Barrier Reef report Everton cleared to build new Â£500m stadium Announcing the decision, the committee chairman said 20 votes had been cast - with 13 in favour of deleting the city, five against the proposal and two ballot papers being invalid. Liverpool's Liberal Democrat leader Richard Kempsaid it was a ""day of shame"" for the city,,externaladding that it would ""without a doubt, affect our tourism and inward investment"". This video can not be played City's heritage status loss ""a real shame"" The city was awarded the much-coveted title in 2004 in recognition of its historical and architectural impact, joining places including the Taj Mahal, Egypt's Pyramids and Canterbury Cathedral. It recognised its history as a major trading centre during the British Empire and its architectural landmarks. However, a report in June by the World Heritage Committee said developments on the city's waterfront had resulted in ""irreversible loss of attributes"". It cited theLiverpool Waters projectandEverton's new stadium, which is being built at Bramley Moore Dock. Chris Capes, director of development for Peel L&P's Liverpool Waters, said he was disappointed ""particularly given the considerable investment that the city has put into protecting and improving its heritage sites"". Everton have agreed to invest up to Â£55m to ""preserve, restore and celebrate the heritage assets"" of the area as part of its stadium plan. They project was approved following two public consultations, with the second survey attracting more than 40,000 people. The club found 98% of people supported the proposed design of the stadium, while 96% backed the club's plans for historic features on the site. By Claire Hamilton, BBC Radio Merseyside political reporter Liverpool has seen more peaks and troughs than most, and it's a city which has changed immeasurably since 2004 when the World Heritage Status was conferred. Back then, there was no Liverpool One shopping centre, no hint that Everton would consider building a multi-million pound waterfront stadium and its year as European Capital of Culture hadn't happened. The city has changed. Today, there's a sense of defiance in some quarters about Unesco's decision that the city doesn't need the title, especially if sits in the way of progress for an area which has lain neglected and semi derelict for decades. Critics argue the benefits of being a World Heritage status were never properly spelled out and there wasn't the political will in the city to address Unesco's concerns until recently, when it was too late. Many people argue that tourists visiting the Pier Head, St George's Plateau or Penny Lane are not coming because Liverpool is a designated World Heritage site - they probably don't even realise it is. They're coming for the Beatles, the football, food and the history but that history will remain. Yet today's announcement worries those who fear that the ability to protect heritage, architecture and history is now diminished, that there will be a free-for-all of unsuitable, careless development. The argument for the last decade has been presented as a binary choice: heritage or progress? The feeling in Liverpool is, couldn't we have had both? Dr David Jeffery hopes the decision will act as a warning to the council Dr David Jeffery, who is a lecturer of British politics at the University of Liverpool, said he believed the decision would not have a ""serious impact"" on the city's tourism industry. ""I do hope this serves as a warning to the council to stop approving ugly buildings though,"" he said. Wayne Colquhoun, who has campaigned for 15 years to keep Liverpool's heritage status, said he was ""devastated"" by the news. ""It's the status symbol that has put us up there with the Great Wall of China and the pyramids and now it has gone,"" he said. ""You've got to be clever being a World Heritage city and be able to take traditional materials and build them in a modern manner."" Wayne Colquhoun said the decision would ""stop people thinking that we are up there with the greatest cities on Earth"" Richie Wright, 40, who has lived in Liverpool all his life, said the status had ""on many occasions, hampered and restricted development in a city that is ripe for development"". ""I hope that Liverpool and its wider city region now seizes this opportunity to make common sense decisions that make our city and the world proud,"" he said.

"The UK has unveiled a new set of demands to redraw the post-Brexit trading arrangements it agreed with the EU for Northern Ireland. The government said border checks on goods from Great Britain it signed up to in the 2019 Brexit divorce deal had proved unsustainable. Brexit Minister Lord Frost said they risked harming business, and were damaging the ""fabric"" of the UK. The EU said it would not agree to renegotiate the terms of the 2019 deal. The checks are included in the Northern Ireland Protocol, a section of the Brexit deal designed to avoid border checks on the island of Ireland.

"Andrew Dymock had denied 15 offences relating to terrorism and hatred A neo-Nazi student who created two extremist groups and promoted a ""distorted and wicked cause"" has been jailed. Andrew Dymock, 24, from Bath, led the outlawed groups System Resistance Network (SRN) and Sonnenkrieg Division. A judge said Dymock was ""driven by an extremist mindset"" and had taken the path of ""total hatred and bigotry"". He was convicted of 15 offences and jailed for seven years, with a further three years on extended licence. Dymock's trial in June heard he used the SRN website and a Twitter account to state thatJewish people should be exterminatedand encourage lone actor terror attacks. He advocated for societal collapse and a race war, and called for gay peopleto be ""purged"" from society. Jurors were shown this image of Dymock during his trial Judge Mark Dennis QC, sitting at The Old Bailey, said he believed Dymock was dangerous and posed a ""significant risk of serious harm"" to the public. ""It is clear you were a leader and not a follower,"" he said. He added Dymock was an ""intelligent, well-read"" person but also ""wholly misguided"". The court had heard Dymock wrote an online article stating a ""racial holy war is inevitable"" and that ""every stabbing, bombing, shooting further plays into our hands"". The neo-Nazi given away by his rainbow sheets He was expelled from SRN in late February 2018 and arrested in June of that year at Gatwick Airport, as he tried to board a flight to the US. In his luggage police found extreme right-wing literature including Siege, an anthology of pro-Nazi essays written by James Mason, and Mein Kampf, along with clothing bearing neo-Nazi logos. Images taken from SRN videos were shown to jurors Judge Dennis said: ""Despite all the advantages of a good education and family upbringing you chose, at the age of 20, to take the path of dreadful bigotry, intolerance and hatred towards other members of our society solely on the basis of their race, creed or sexual orientation. ""In setting up and running the website and Twitter account for your extremist cause, you were prepared to inflame such vile prejudices in others and to promote and encourage hatred and violence towards other human beings in furtherance of your distorted and wicked cause."" The former student had been supported throughout his trial by his parents, Stella and Dr David Dymock, a professor of dentistry at Bristol University, who he lived with. The court heard they had written to the judge asking for leniency ahead of the sentencing. Defence lawyer Andrew Morris said they were ""extremely worried"" about the impact of jail on their son. Dymock told jurors ""thank you for killing me"" when he was convicted Dymock, who at the time was studying politics at Aberystwyth University in Wales, denied being behind the SRN accounts, claiming he wasset up by an ex-girlfriend, who had failed to recruit him to join banned terrorist group National Action (NA). He denied being a neo-Nazi and told police: ""In fact, I am bisexual but lean towards being homosexual, in direct conflict with Nazism."" He was found guilty of five charges of encouraging terrorism, two of fundraising for terrorism, four counts of disseminating terrorist publications, possessing a terrorist document, stirring up racial hatred and hatred based on sexual orientation, and possessing racially inflammatory material. Dymock's trial was shown images of him performing nazi salutes and holding extremist flags Det Chf Supt Martin Snowden, head of Counter Terrorism Policing North East, which led the investigation into Dymock, said: ""Dymock represented a threat to our society, not simply because of his mindset but because of the considerable efforts he exerted spreading his ideology and misusing his abilities.""

"Decisions made by managers at the DVLA driving licence body have meant a ""catastrophic"" processing backlog of 1.4 million cases, a union says. Mark Serwotka, head of the Public and Commercial Services union, said if staff were allowed to work from home the backlog could be reduced. He told Transport Committee MPs other members of the civil service ""were tearing their hair out"" at the DVLA. He said it is a ""stain"" on the reputation of the civil service. Mr Serwotka said the DVLA are ""refusing to engage in a proper discussion."" Further strike action at DVLA over Covid safety DVLA workers begin four-day strike ""In 21 years [in this role], I have never encountered the level of incompetence and mismanagement that is on display at the DVLA in Swansea,"" Mr Serwotka told the MPs on Wednesday. ""The tragedy of that is not just that public are suffering. Our members, many of whom are quite lowly paid and very stressed at work, are bearing the brunt of this."" Mr Serwotka said there had been 643 Covid cases and one fatality at the DVLA during the course of the pandemic and that there are serious risks to staff health and safety because of its actions. Sarah Evans, the DVLA branch chair at PCS, said that staff are worried as they can see cases rising on site, but that they have been told not to complain. ""Our work site is very different because there is a high volume of staff in a small area,"" Ms Evans told the committee. The union wants more staff to be able to work from home to be able to allow for better social distancing in the offices and to allow those isolating at home to still continue to be productive. It said other departments had been able to deliver remote working. ""We believe that if the Department of Work and Pensions can deal with three million universal credit claims, if HMRC can deliver furlough scheme, if we have workers in the Home Office,  Ministry of Justice, devolved nations, working from home, handling in some cases much more secure data, so could the DVLA,"" said Mr Serwotka. ""We know there can't be a security issue in the DVLA that's not the same in the rest of the civil service. ""Weeks and weeks of productivity have been lost by stopping staff working from home,"" said Ms Evans. ""There's no doubt at all that we would not be in situation we are inâ¦ had we been given the capability."" Laura-Louise Fairley is still waiting to hear from the DVLA about a replacement driving licence Laura-Louise Fairley says she applied for her driving licence online on 10 June. Nearly six weeks later, she's still waiting. ""It's bad enough when things don't work, but there's no contact point, that's the problem,"" she told the BBC. ""A six week wait is not the end of the world, but I don't know if that will turn into a six month wait. Until then, I can't make plans."" Ms Fairley applied for a replacement driving licence in order to hire a car to visit family in Buckinghamshire and Berkshire with her daughter. She says she has attempted to reach the DVLA around 30 times, but has only been able to speak to an operator once. On other occasions, she says she was directed to an automated message that then ended the call, and on the website, her request is labelled as being ""in process"". A DVLA spokeswoman told the BBC: ""Our contact centre is open during business hours but there are significant delays in contacting us due to ongoing social distancing requirements in Wales which means that we have fewer staff than usual on site at any one time. ""We understand this is causing frustration for our customers and we are sorry for the inconvenience."" She added that demand is currently ""very high"" and staff are working ""extremely hard"" to answer customer queries. Mr Serwotka added that although it believed there was a lack of investment in technology, the union had been told that it was also because the DVLA was concerned about trust and supervision of staff. The PCS and the DVLA are currently in an industrial dispute that has seen targeted strike action since April where staff in different departments have walked out for a few days at a time. The PCS said that it negotiated a deal after months of discussions that would protect the health of workers and provide respite and recognition of what they had done over the last few months. It said that the agreement was withdrawn on 1 June without an explanation. Baroness Vere of Norbiton, Minister for Roads, Buses and Places, told the committee that the government and DVLA estimated that 400,000 of the backlog is due to the industrial action and that that they were being 'held to ransom' by the PCS union. She said that while the industrial action was undertaken about covid safety, that it was not right that PCS were introducing a bonus and holiday request to end the strikes, and that it was likely that the strike could be settled ""if they took requests for holiday and bonuses off the table"". DVLA's chief executive Julie Leonard told MPs it was advisable for people to do their applications online where possible. Paper documentation can take six to 10 weeks, whereas online processing can be sorted ""in days"", she said. She added: ""We have taken staff safety incredibly seriously at every point in this. Had it been easy to have more people working at home, we would have done it. ""Staff safety really has come first. It will still come down to if we are receiving 60,000 items of mail, we will still need people on site to open and process those items that are arriving each and every day and that's a real challenge for us. ""We are exploring every single option to see how we can increase the numbers who work from home. We are conscious of resilience should this be a difficult winter.""

"Rashford asked on Twitter: ""Why has there always got to be a motive?"" Footballer Marcus Rashford has defended his off-field partnerships amid claims he has profited by campaigning. The Manchester United and England forward tweeted he had heard political magazine The Spectator was due to publish a story about him getting an income from the partnerships. The 23-year-old has backed child food poverty incentives and raised Â£20m for groups tackling the issue. He questioned why footballers ""can't just do the right thing"" for charity. The article has not yet been published. The England player has also forced a series of government U-turns over free school meals during the coronavirus pandemic. He tweeted a thread on Tuesday saying accusing him of benefitting financially from these charity partnerships was ""just a non-starter"". Allow Twitter content?

Rashford's Burberry partnership saw the fashion company make a number of donations to youth charities and youth clubs, including London Youth and Norbrook Youth Club in Manchester, which he went to as a child. Before that he started a petition urging ministers to extend free school meals through half-term and the Christmas holidays, eventually pressuring ministers into providing Â£170m of extra funding. Hundreds of messages have been left on the mural Rashford wrote on Tuesday: ""Just heard Spectator are planning to run a story on me tomorrow about how I have benefitted commercially in the last 18 months. ""To clarify, I don't need to partner with brands. I partner because I want to progress the work I do off the pitch and most of any fee I would receive contributes to that. ""Last summer, 1.3M children had access to food support, through my relationship with Burberry children have a safe place to be after school where they will be fed, following the November investment vulnerable children have safe places to go this summer holiday, and due to my relationship with Macmillan 80,000 children now have a book to call their own. ""Do I have a larger commercial appeal following the U-turns? I'm sure. But I'm also a Manchester United and England international footballer. Why has there always got to be a motive? Why can't we just do the right thing? ""I actually enjoy reading bits from The Spectator now and again but this is just a non-starter."" Rashford 'overwhelmed' by mural anti-racism demo I won't apologise for who I am - Rashford The messages of pride and positivity for Rashford Rashford, who received free school meals himself, was made an MBE in the delayed 2020 Queen's Birthday Honours List. A mural honouring the footballer was vandalised with graffiti following England's defeat to Italy in the Euro 2020 final. Hundreds of heartfelt notes were later placed on the artwork in Withington, Manchester.

"This video can not be played Commuters and children rescued from China floodwaters Twelve people have died after record-breaking rainfall flooded underground railway tunnels in China, leaving passengers trapped in rising waters. Video shared on social media shows evening commuters just managing to keep their heads above water. Water is seen rushing onto platforms. More than 500 people were eventually rescued from the tunnels in Henan province, officials said. Days of rain have caused widespread damage and led to 200,000 evacuations. Above ground, roads have been turned into rivers, with cars and debris swept along in fast moving currents. A number ofpedestrians have had to be rescued. In total, 25 people have died in Henan province and more than a dozen cities are affected. President Xi Jinping said on Wednesday that there had been ""significant loss of life and damage to property"". Several dams and reservoirs have breached warning levels, and soldiers have been mobilised to divert rivers which have burst their banks. Flights and trains in many parts of Henan have also been suspended. In the provincial capital  Zhengzhou, the equivalent of a year's average rainfall has fallen in just three days. On Tuesday, some of the city's flood defences were overwhelmed and water began flowing down into the railway tunnels. Survivors have described how water leaked through the doors, rising slowly from ""our ankles to our knees to our necks"". ""All of us who could, stood on the subway seats,"" one woman wrote on Chinese social network site Weibo. Science failed to predict flood and heat intensity Record heat points to 'extraordinary' extremes Children were lifted out of the water by their parents, while others threw off anything which might hold them down. After about half an hour, one passenger said it became ""hard to breathe"". An order to shut down the line came at 18:10 local time (10:10 GMT) so the evacuation could begin, Zhengzhou government officials said in a statement. Five people are being treated for injuries, with 12 having died. Elsewhere in the central Chinese city, children had to be rescued from a flooded nursery school. State media aired footage of them being floated out in plastic tubs by rescuers. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou Hospital also briefly lost power on Tuesday night, though this has now been restored, said a statement on Weibo by the Zhengzhou Municipal Party Committee. It added that 600 critically ill patients had been transferred to another location. Another resident, identified as Mr Liu, 27, told BBC Chinese he had had ""no water, no electricity, and no internet"". ""Never in my life had I seen so much rain,"" Mr Liu added. ""There was one hour where the rain was just pouring down on us from the heavens, and everything went completely white."" But the rising waters were not just confined to Zhengzhou. A 20-metre (65ft) breach has emerged in the dam in Luoyang city after it was damaged by storms, officials said. Soldiers have been deployed to the area and a statement from the army warned it could ""collapse at any time"". Another user said that residents in Sishui town were stuck on rooftops. ""We don't know how to swimâ¦ the whole village is about to be washed away,"" the person wrote. Henan has experienced ""rare and severe rainfall"" since Saturday, China's meteorological authority said on Wednesday. Zhengzhou saw 624mm of rainfall on Tuesday, with a third of that amount falling between 16:00 and 17:00 alone, which ""smashed historical records"". It forecasted that parts of the region would continue to see ""severe or extremely severe storms"" and that the heavy rain was likely to end only on Thursday. Many factors contribute to flooding, but a warming atmosphere caused by climate change makes extreme rainfall more likely. Part of the Yellow River basin in China, Henan has several major river systems running through the province which are prone to flooding. Zhengzhou, which has a population of 12 million, sits on the banks of the Yellow River itself. Scientists have warned that widespread dam construction has exacerbated climate change problems in China's flood zone, says the BBC's China correspondent Stephen McDonell. Connections between rivers and lakes have been cut and disrupted flood plains which once absorbed much of the region's annual summer downpours.

"The UK has unveiled a new set of demands to redraw the post-Brexit trading arrangements it agreed with the EU for Northern Ireland. The government said border checks on goods from Great Britain it signed up to in the 2019 Brexit divorce deal had proved unsustainable. Brexit Minister Lord Frost said they risked harming business, and were damaging the ""fabric"" of the UK. The EU said it would not agree to renegotiate the terms of the 2019 deal.

Lord Frost told the House of Lords there was a ""growing sense in Northern Ireland we have not found the right balance, seen in an ongoing febrile political climate, protests and regrettable instances of occasional disorder"". He also called on the EU to agree a ""standstill period"" to prevent a ban on sending chilled meat products such as sausages from Great Britain coming into force in September, when the full terms of the deal kick in.

Under its terms, Northern Ireland effectivelyremains part of the EU's single market,externalfor goods, meaning it complies with standards set by Brussels. The biggest practical difficulty, in trade terms, concerns the movement of food from Britain to Northern Ireland, which could then be transported into the EU via the Irish land border. The prime minister's former chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, has told BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg that the protocol had been a ""fudge"". Both sides had wanted to ""sign up to something that was not what either side really wanted and which punted difficult questions into the future to figure out later"", he added. This video can not be played Brexit deal was ""inherently self-contradictory in various ways,"" says Dominic Cummings European Commission Vice-President MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ said the EU was willing to ""seek creative solutions within the framework of the protocol"" to ease border issues. But he added the 27-member union would not agree to a ""renegotiation"" of the Brexit deal. ""Respecting international legal obligations is of paramount importance,"" he added. DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said: ""We welcome the acceptance from the government that the protocol is not working, that it is causing real harm to our economy in Northern Ireland and it is simply not sustainable."" He called the UK government's statement - and its publication of a command paper describing its demands - an ""important first step"".

"MPs question Boris Johnson as he faces the Commons in the weekly PMQs He is currently isolating at Chequers, after coming into contact with the health secretary, who has Covid Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer asks about his decision to isolate after initially saying he was taking part in a testing scheme instead The PM says people must isolate if contacted, and says the government is concentrating on rolling out the vaccine programme He is also asked about Dominic Cummings' assertion that he resisted lockdown last autumn as the people dying from it were ""essentially all over 80"" The PM says he has done whatever he could to save lives - and followed scientific advice at every turn It's the 60th anniversary of PMQs - the inaugural session was 18 July 1961 - and the last before Parliament goes into recess Industry is warning over rising Covid cases and requests for people to isolate Later today, ministers will unveil how they want to overhaul trading arrangements between Britain and Northern Ireland that came into effect after Brexit Georgina Pattinson That's where we leave our coverage of PMQs for today - it was the final session before MPs head on their summer recess. Thanks for joining us and we'll see you again after the break, when MPs return. Bye for now. During Prime Minister's Questions, Boris Johnson came under fire from MPs for the continuing rules on self-isolation. Downing Street says that self-isolating is ""crucial"" if you are told to do so by the NHS Covid-19 app. The remarks were made after Business Minister Paul Scully previously said he would ""encourage"" people to self-isolate but the app was there to let people make an ""informed decision"". Keir Starmer accused the PM of being a ""super spreader"" of confusion over Covid rules. Meanwhile, Richard Burgon, a Labour MP, asked if statutory sick pay of Â£96 a week was enough to help people self-isolate. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

She says it will ""ring really hollow"" for families who have lost loved ones ""that we have not got the public inquiry we need"" and that people over the age of 80 ""seem to have been treated with such disparagement by this prime minister"". Reality Check At Prime Ministerâs Questions
today, Keir Starmer said that the UK has âthe
highest death toll in Europe"". As we have reportedbefore, that is correct: the UK
has reported the largest number of deaths of any country in Europe. But it does not take into
account population size. Some smaller countries have reported higher rates of
deaths per 100,000 people. The UK did have the worst
figures across most measures in the first wave of coronavirus, but has since
been overtaken by countries that had worse winters. Chair of the Conservative Party, Amanda Milling, is on BBC Two's Politics Live. She is asked about Dominic Cummings'comments about the PM's allegedly resisting lockdown as he said only 'over 80s' were dying. Keir Starmer and Ian Blackford raised it at PMQs - and she's whether she will apologise on the PM's behalf. She says lockdowns are not just about health but about the impact on business and people's mental health and as a result are really difficult decisions. She says the public recognise how hard these decisions were and her ""heart goes out to those who have lost loved ones"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Lib Dem Sarah Olney says her daughter was among the one million children out of school last week due to the need to self-isolate when there was a positive case in their bubble. She asks if the PM can confirm that his approach to managing the virus will guarantee that all children will have an uninterrupted return to their learning after the summer break. Boris Johnson says the needs of children in this pandemic are the focus and it is of ""paramount importance"" to keep them in school. He says ministers will do everything they can to get schools back in September and he has every confidence they will be, but everyone offered a jab must get vaccinated. Richard Burgon - a Labour MP - says the PM is ""having to self isolate just as hundreds of thousands of people across the country are having to do thanks to his mismanagement of the pandemic"". He says not everyone has access to a country estate with a heated swimming pool (a dig at Johnson, who is self-isolating at Chequers). He asks if the PM could survive on Â£96 sick pay per week. Boris Johnson says everyone who is self-isolating has access to the equivalent of the living wage, which is sick pay. He says some people can get additional Â£500 payments to help them with staying at home. Conservative Selaine Saxby says people want to come to her north Devon constituency but what  assurances can the PM give to residents that planning reforms will protect them against second home buyers? She says unless protections are in place, ""vibrant coastal communities"" will become ""winter ghost towns"". The PM says the government has brought in a series of measures such as higher rates of stamp duty on the buying of additional properties. And he says his strategy is to make sure people growing up around the country have the chance of home ownership in the place where they live. Labour MP Debbie Abrahams says the Department for Work and Pensions is currently carrying out ""124 process reviews following the deaths of 97 claimants"". She says there were 27 from serious harm, which represents a three fold increase since 2012. She says the government can't keep marking its own homework on claimant deaths. She asks him to meet her and those bereaved by the tragedies. She warns that some are of the belief that the 97 deaths could be ""the tip of the iceberg"". Boris Johnson says he will make sure she receives a full account of what the government is doing to ""put this right"". Later today, Lord Frost, the former chief Brexit negotiator
for the UK, will outline to the Lordshow the government wants to overhaul theNorthern Ireland Protocol. Since its introduction, it has caused supply issues in
Northern Ireland, leading to some areas experiencing food shortages. The Protocol helps prevent the need for checks on the land
border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. Lord Frost says the deal is unfair and unsustainable. The Protocol was negotiated by Lord Frost, but itâs expected
he will say the terms need to be radically changed. Labour's Stephen Timms raises the issue of Universal Credit and says plans to end the Â£20 a week top in the autumn up should not go ahead. Will the PM follow his own talk about ""levelling up"" and keep the increase? he asks. Boris Johnson says he wants to ""level up"" across the whole of the UK and get people off benefits and in to work. He says he wants to see higher wages. DUP MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson says in light of the judicial ruling in the High Court, that the Northern Ireland Protocol breaks the union, he asks what the government will do to ""fully remove the Irish Sea Border"". Boris Johnson congratulates Sir Jeffrey on becoming leader of the DUP. He says the government will be ""setting out today"" the steps that it will take to change the Northern Ireland Protocol. Nothing in the Protocol threatens the ""territorial integrity of the United Kingdom"", he states. SNP Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, raises the interview Dominic Cummings gave to the BBC and says it is clear the PM was pushing to ""allow the virus to run rampant"". How can anyone have faith in the PM, he asks? Mr Johnson says the substance of what he is alleged to have said is ""grossly mischaracterised"" and everyone in the country understands how difficult the decisions were that ministers had to take. There were ""no good ways through"", he says and there will be a full public inquiry to come. Blackford says the over 80s were expendable to the PM and his ""glib attitude"" to human life is not acceptable. He says ministers should be ""made to answer under oath"" and the inquiry should begin immediately before any general election is called. The PM says it is not right to ask people to devote time to an inquiry before the spring while they are still dealing with the pandemic. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer says the prime minister's answers have ""no resemblence to the questions I'm actually asking him"". He says all the PM needs to do ""is say sorry"". He says the PM has broken promises and has still has not unveiled a plan for social care, he's now raising working-age taxes while cutting the army and overseas aid. The PM has let the UK have one of the worst death rates and has a damaged economy, he states. He says there's a new three word slogan from the government this morning which is ""keep life moving"" - but says the slogan the government should be using is ""get a grip"". Boris Johnson says that thanks to the vaccine rollout nine million people have now come off furlough and unemployment is two million lower than predicted. And the PM says his three word slogan is ""get a jab"" while the government is turning ""jabs jabs jabs"" into ""jobs jobs jobs"". Itâs been an explosive set of revelations over the past 48
hours. On Monday morning, the BBC revealed it had secured an
interview with the former Downing Street aide, Dominic Cummings. The interview
was an hour long and was broadcast last night on BBC Two at 7pm. Cummings claimed in the interview,among other things: Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer says on 26 May, he asked the prime minister if he had ever used words to the effect that ""Covid was only killing over 80 year olds"". He says that on that day, the PM never outright denied using the words. He says with the revelation from former aide Dominic Cummings, citing messages between him and the PM, we can now see that the PM did say that. He asks if the prime minister will apologise for using those words. Boris Johnson says nothing he can say or do ""can make up for the loss and the suffering that people have endured during this pandemic"". He says when decisions were being made ""in those incredibly tough and dark times"" that the government had to try and balance the damage done by lockdown versus letting the virus spread.

This video can not be played Brexit deal was ""inherently self-contradictory in various ways,"" says Dominic Cummings European Commission Vice-President MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ said the EU was willing to ""seek creative solutions within the framework of the protocol"" to ease border issues. But he added the 27-member union would not agree to a ""renegotiation"" of the Brexit deal. ""Respecting international legal obligations is of paramount importance,"" he added. DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said: ""We welcome the acceptance from the government that the protocol is not working, that it is causing real harm to our economy in Northern Ireland and it is simply not sustainable."" He called the UK government's statement - and its publication of a command paper describing its demands - an ""important first step"". However, Sinn Fein Brexit spokesperson Declan Kearney called on the UK government to ""stop the evasion"" and ""get on"" with implementing the deal it agreed. ""It is not acceptable for the Tories to adopt an a la carte approach towards the protocol, to rewrite history, and now attempt a renegotiation,"" he added. Industry group Manufacturing NI said the UK's proposals would create ""confusion and uncertainty for business"" and were likely to ""create conflict with the EU"". It called on the EU to ""go further to ensure the UK's market works for business and consumers in Northern Ireland"". ""Both parties owe it to the people in Northern Ireland to skip the drama and get on with dialogue and decision making,"" the body added. For Labour, Brexit spokeswoman Baroness Chapman urged the government to ""fix the problems the prime minister created"". ""Communities are tired of these games and the political stalemate,"" she added.

A new team will be back tomorrow - in the meantime, you can find any significant developments on ourmain news pages. We're drawing our live coverage of coronavirus developments to a close. Let's re-cap what happened in the UK: France has introduced a new health pass for some venues and public spaces The Delta variant spreads, France rolls out its Covid health
pass and Australians brace for more lockdowns. Here are the Covid headlines
from around the world: Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Authorities in Nanjing announced city-wide testing on Wednesday Part of a
major Chinese city has today gone into lockdown, after 17 airport workers
tested positive. According to
Chinaâs officialXinhua News Agency,external, employees at Nanjingâs Lukou International
Airport have tested positive. Nine of those are symptomatic. Flights have
subsequently been cancelled and 500 people have been placed under medical
observation. The local government today announced a citywide testing drive,
which will cover 9.3 million people. Four communities and villages in the city
have now become âmedium riskâ, meaning that local lockdown measures are in
place. Nanjing, in
eastern Jiangsu, is now one of two Chinese cities where there are lockdown
measures in place. There has been an outbreak since early July at the opposite
end of the country in a city called Ruili, which borders Myanmar. There are more
than 200 people currently in hospital in Yunnan province, many in the city of
Ruili. Today, a new testing drive has also been ordered there. Residents in
Ruili have already experienced multiple testing drives throughout the pandemic,
as the city has experienced four waves of the coronavirus. It has a population
of some 270,000 people. This video can not be played Inside India's deadly mucormycosis fungus epidemic Mucormycosis, a rare and deadly infection known as ""black fungus"", has killed more than 4,300 people in India, the health ministry has reported. The country has recorded 45,374 cases of the illness. Doctors say the fungus has a link with the steroids used to treat Covid, and diabetics are at particular risk. But the scale of the problem could be even greater. Dr Raghuraj Hegde, a Bangalore-based eye surgeon who has treated a number of mucormycosis patients, told the BBC that there had been ""massive undercounting of both cases and deaths"" from the disease. ""Typically, deaths in mucormycosis occur weeks to months after getting the disease. Our present systems are not good to capture that data,"" he said. You can read more about ithere Uptake of the coronavirus vaccine has been lower among ethnic minorities in Scotland, with African groups having the lowest levels of inoculation, the latest data shows. Rates are also lower among Asian Scots and those of Black or Caribbean heritage, figures from Public Health Scotland show. Other studies have found similarly lower levels of vaccination among ethnic minorities elsewhere in the UK. In Scotland, the difference has been most apparent in the 70 to 74 age range, where first dose uptake is 97.2% for the white ethnic group and 73.7% for the African ethnic group. For the Asian group in this age range, uptake was at 89.7% while the figure for Black or Caribbean Scots was 93.8%. While uptake was high in all age ranges among white Scots, it varied considerably among Black or Caribbean Scots, with uptake ranging from 96.0% in the over 80s to 46.0% in those aged 18-29 years. A further 44,104 people have tested positive for the coronavirus across the UK,government figures,externalshow. Another 73 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were also reported.  Over 39,000 people died of coronavirus in care home settings in England between 10 April 2020 and 31 March this year. Amanda Henry had been unable to see her father Robert, 78, for nearly four weeks - and when she was at last allowed into his care home in Poplar, east London, it was because he was gravely ill. Care homes were struggling to get personal protective equipment and the official guidance they needed. At the time Amanda just wanted to give him some comfort, but even then - in April 2020 - she says she noticed shortcomings with personal protective equipment (PPE). There was not enough of it, it was flimsy, and staff were not using it properly, she claims. Staff were going from room to room, not changing their PPE, not washing their hands between rooms, and some had no PPE at all, she says. ""What I was witnessing was the virus being spread amongst the residents of the care home in real time... ""I feel it tells us that these vulnerable elderly people were disposable to this government... ""I'm angry, I'm angry that my dad had to suffer like that."" Read morehere. More than 39,000 people died of coronavirus in care homes in England in the year from 10 April 2020 to 31 March 2021, new figures suggest. The numbers, released by the Care Quality Commission (CQC), show how the virus spread across the country. The highest number of deaths in a single care home was 44, while 21 homes had more than 30 Covid-related deaths. ""Every number represents a life lost,"" said Kate Terroni, CQC chief inspector for adult social care. Read morehere. The British Retail Consortium (BRC) has urged the government to ensure staff in stores and suppliers should be allowed to work even if they get an alert to self-isolate. The BRC's Andrew Opie said the ""pingdemic"" meant retailers were finding it difficult to maintain opening hours and keep shelves stocked. ""Government needs to act fast. Retail workers and suppliers, who have played a vital role throughout this pandemic, should be allowed to work provided they are double vaccinated or can show a negative Covid test, to ensure there is no disruption to the public's ability to get food and other goods,"" he said. The boss of Iceland supermarkets and leaders at pub chain Greene King have also called for new rulesto avoid crippling shutdowns. Croatia wants tourists to return, but has imposed mandatory testing rules for some Croatia has been on the UK's green list of countries for travel - the lowest level of restriction - since Monday. You can read about the rules for green, amber and red list countrieshere Croatia however has changed the rules for arrivals from the UK, as well as those from Cyprus and Russia. As of Monday 26 July, all visitors from these countries will need proof of a negative Covid test - regardless of whether they've been vaccinated or have proof of recovery from the virus. Tourism accounts for about 20% of the country's economy. But cases have been rising there over the last 10 days, particularly in areas along the Adriatic Coast. On Wednesday, authorities reported 191 new infections in Croatia. Sir Keir Starmer's self-isolation means four of the country's most senior politicians are now quarantining at home. Last week, Health Secretary Sajid Javid tested positive after feeling unwell, leading Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Chancellor Rishi Sunak to isolate at Chequers - the PM's house in Buckinghamshire -  and Downing Street respectively. It has been reported this week that Javid's positive test has forced a raft of senior No 10 and health department officials to self-isolate. It was initially announced that Johnson and Sunak would avoid having to self-isolate through a pilot daily testing programme, but this decisionwas reversed less than three hours later on Sunday. We know Sir Keir was in the Commons earlier for PMQs so it raises the question: if he goes on to develop Covid, how many other politicians will need to self-isolate? As it is announced Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer is to begin self-isolation after one of his children tested positive for Covid (seeearlier posts), let's re-cap the rules he will need to observe. While many restrictions on daily life have now lifted in England, stay-at-home orders for those in close contact with confirmed coronavirus cases have remained in place. Currently, you must self-isolate for 10 days if you test positive, live with someone who tests positive, are told to isolate by NHS Test and Trace, or someone you live with has symptoms. Some fully vaccinated critical workers in England - including health and care staff - will be able to leave isolation to go to work, even if they are traced as a contact of someone with Covid. But these people are specifically named on a letter from a government department in advance of any potential self-isolation order. Changes to the rules around self-isolation for people who are fully vaccinated are due to begin from 16 August in England. Read more about the current ruleshere. The BBC Proms will go ahead at full capacity this year, with audience members ""strongly encouraged"" to wear masks. They will also be required to provide a negative lateral flow test, a positive PCR test or proof of double vaccination. Promming tickets, where audience members can stand in the arena or gallery areas of the Royal Albert Hall, will also be available on the day of each concert. The 2020 edition featured a reduced orchestra playing to an empty auditorium - with the singers placed in the stalls. The return of the fully-fledged event will feature52 concerts over 44 days featuring 30 orchestras and ensembles, more than 100 soloists and conductors and more than 2,000 musicians. The BBC says: ""The safety of our audiences is our main priority and we are taking every step we can to open the Proms safely without social distancing."" Audience members over the age of 18 will be asked to provide a negative lateral flow test taken within 48 hours of the performance, or evidence of double vaccination provided via the NHS app or a letter provided by the NHS. They can also offer proof of natural immunity based upon a positive PCR test taken within 180 days of the performance. Under 18s will be asked for verbal confirmation from a parent or guardian that they have not received a positive test. The BBC Proms opens on 30 July and runs until 11 September. The news that Sir Keir Starmer has begun self-isolation comes just hours after he described a ""summer of chaos"" amid soaring numbers of people self-isolating at home. Starmer dubbed PM Boris Johnson - who is himself self-isolating in Buckinghamshire - the ""Chequers one"" as he mocked Johnson's isolation on the same week most remaining curbs lifted in England. Speaking in the Commons, Starmer said: ""Everything may be calm from the prime minister's country retreat but back here the truth is we're heading for a summer of chaos."" It is the fourth time Labour leader has self-isolated after coming in close contact with a confirmed Covid case since the pandemic began. Starmer isolated inJanuary,December and September last year after being notified that an associate had tested positive. Given his child's positive test came at lunchtime, Starmer may have to self-isolate until 31 July - potentially throwing into doubt any plans his family might have made for a summer holiday. The House of Commons goes into recess tomorrow. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer is to self-isolate after one of his children tested positive, a spokesman says. ""One of Keir's children tested positive for Covid this lunchtime. In line with the rules, Keir and his family will now be self-isolating,"" they said. ""Keir was already doing daily tests and tested negative this morning. He will continue to take daily tests."" Earlier we told you of some of the big name businesses forced to close or reduce services because of the ""pingdemic"". But it's not just household names affected - smaller businesses have told of the disruption caused when staff have to self-isolate. Mrs Salisbury's Tea Rooms in Maldon, Essex is closed until Saturday as co-owner Mike Bloomfield and five staff - half the workforce - are self-isolating after being in contact with a positive Covid case. He says: ""Luckily everybody is negative [for Covid-19] and doing fine at the moment but we still have to do what we have to do and isolate."" Sean Hughes Sean Hughes, who owns pubs in St Albans, says he has been forced to close The Boot due to one member of staff being contacted by NHS Test and Trace and others being pinged by the app. ""We have reduced hours and closed the kitchen for most of this week until they can come back. ""All tests thus far showing negative on a daily basis. It is a complete mess."" You can read more reaction from businesses ownershere. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Nearly a quarter of Taiwan's population have reportedly received one vaccine dose In the last 24 hours, Taiwan has confirmed 16 new local
cases and five further deaths. It has now been five days that Taiwan has
recorded fewer than 20 local cases. Covid-19 restrictions are set to end on Monday, so in the
next couple of days, the Central Epidemic Command Centre will decide whether or
not to relax indoor and outdoor gathering limits, after two months of near
lockdown. Currently, five people are allowed to gather indoors, and 10
outdoors. Since 20 May, all of Taiwan has been in Level 3
restrictions. This is where all but essential businesses are closed, and

23.5% of Taiwanâs 23.5m population have now had one dose of either AstraZeneca

"The UK has unveiled a new set of demands to redraw the post-Brexit trading arrangements it agreed with the EU for Northern Ireland. The government said border checks on goods from Great Britain it signed up to in the 2019 Brexit divorce deal had proved unsustainable. Brexit Minister Lord Frost said they risked harming business, and were damaging the ""fabric"" of the UK. The EU said it would not agree to renegotiate the terms of the 2019 deal. The checks are included in the Northern Ireland Protocol, a section of the Brexit deal designed to avoid border checks on the island of Ireland. Lord Frost called on the EU to look on the UK's proposals with ""fresh eyes,"" adding: ""We cannot go on as we are."" M&S to cut Christmas products in Northern Ireland No renegotiation on Protocol as UK warns of action DUP leader calls for renegotiation of Brexit deal What is the Northern Ireland Protocol? However, he announced the UK would not be triggering Article 16 of the protocol - which would allow it to suspend parts of the Brexit deal - before talks with Brussels. He added that the government believed using it was justifiable, but said: ""Nevertheless, we have concluded that it is not the right moment to do so."" Lord Frost told the House of Lords there was a ""growing sense in Northern Ireland we have not found the right balance, seen in an ongoing febrile political climate, protests and regrettable instances of occasional disorder"". He also called on the EU to agree a ""standstill period"" to prevent a ban on sending chilled meat products such as sausages from Great Britain coming into force in September, when the full terms of the deal kick in. He later told reporters it was ""perfectly normal to change treaties in the light of experience, and it happens all the time"". In a28-page document,external, the UK government suggested changes to: remove customs checks on goods where the GB-registered businesses sending them have declared their final destination is Northern Ireland get rid of certificates and checks for food products ""only ever intended to be consumed in Northern Ireland"" remove medicines entirely from the scope of the protocol allowing labelled goods conforming to UK rules to circulate freely in Northern Ireland alongside EU-registered products The future of the Irish border was a huge sticking point during Brexit talks The protocol was agreed to prevent the return of a hard border between the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland, as both the UK and EU want to prevent any return to the Troubles, which lasted 30 years and cost more than 3,500 lives. Under its terms, Northern Ireland effectivelyremains part of the EU's single market,externalfor goods, meaning it complies with standards set by Brussels. The biggest practical difficulty, in trade terms, concerns the movement of food from Britain to Northern Ireland, which could then be transported into the EU via the Irish land border. The prime minister's former chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, has told BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg that the protocol had been a ""fudge"". Both sides had wanted to ""sign up to something that was not what either side really wanted and which punted difficult questions into the future to figure out later"", he added.

"MPs question Boris Johnson as he faces the Commons in the weekly PMQs He is currently isolating at Chequers, after coming into contact with the health secretary, who has Covid Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer asks about his decision to isolate after initially saying he was taking part in a testing scheme instead The PM says people must isolate if contacted, and says the government is concentrating on rolling out the vaccine programme He is also asked about Dominic Cummings' assertion that he resisted lockdown last autumn as the people dying from it were ""essentially all over 80"" The PM says he has done whatever he could to save lives - and followed scientific advice at every turn It's the 60th anniversary of PMQs - the inaugural session was 18 July 1961 - and the last before Parliament goes into recess Industry is warning over rising Covid cases and requests for people to isolate Later today, ministers will unveil how they want to overhaul trading arrangements between Britain and Northern Ireland that came into effect after Brexit Georgina Pattinson That's where we leave our coverage of PMQs for today - it was the final session before MPs head on their summer recess. Thanks for joining us and we'll see you again after the break, when MPs return. Bye for now. During Prime Minister's Questions, Boris Johnson came under fire from MPs for the continuing rules on self-isolation. Downing Street says that self-isolating is ""crucial"" if you are told to do so by the NHS Covid-19 app. The remarks were made after Business Minister Paul Scully previously said he would ""encourage"" people to self-isolate but the app was there to let people make an ""informed decision"". Keir Starmer accused the PM of being a ""super spreader"" of confusion over Covid rules. Meanwhile, Richard Burgon, a Labour MP, asked if statutory sick pay of Â£96 a week was enough to help people self-isolate. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Reality Check At Prime Ministerâs Questions
today, Keir Starmer said that the UK has âthe
highest death toll in Europe"". As we have reportedbefore, that is correct: the UK
has reported the largest number of deaths of any country in Europe. But it does not take into
account population size. Some smaller countries have reported higher rates of
deaths per 100,000 people. The UK did have the worst
figures across most measures in the first wave of coronavirus, but has since
been overtaken by countries that had worse winters. Chair of the Conservative Party, Amanda Milling, is on BBC Two's Politics Live. She is asked about Dominic Cummings'comments about the PM's allegedly resisting lockdown as he said only 'over 80s' were dying. Keir Starmer and Ian Blackford raised it at PMQs - and she's whether she will apologise on the PM's behalf. She says lockdowns are not just about health but about the impact on business and people's mental health and as a result are really difficult decisions. She says the public recognise how hard these decisions were and her ""heart goes out to those who have lost loved ones"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Lib Dem Sarah Olney says her daughter was among the one million children out of school last week due to the need to self-isolate when there was a positive case in their bubble. She asks if the PM can confirm that his approach to managing the virus will guarantee that all children will have an uninterrupted return to their learning after the summer break. Boris Johnson says the needs of children in this pandemic are the focus and it is of ""paramount importance"" to keep them in school. He says ministers will do everything they can to get schools back in September and he has every confidence they will be, but everyone offered a jab must get vaccinated. Richard Burgon - a Labour MP - says the PM is ""having to self isolate just as hundreds of thousands of people across the country are having to do thanks to his mismanagement of the pandemic"". He says not everyone has access to a country estate with a heated swimming pool (a dig at Johnson, who is self-isolating at Chequers). He asks if the PM could survive on Â£96 sick pay per week. Boris Johnson says everyone who is self-isolating has access to the equivalent of the living wage, which is sick pay. He says some people can get additional Â£500 payments to help them with staying at home. Conservative Selaine Saxby says people want to come to her north Devon constituency but what  assurances can the PM give to residents that planning reforms will protect them against second home buyers? She says unless protections are in place, ""vibrant coastal communities"" will become ""winter ghost towns"". The PM says the government has brought in a series of measures such as higher rates of stamp duty on the buying of additional properties. And he says his strategy is to make sure people growing up around the country have the chance of home ownership in the place where they live. Labour MP Debbie Abrahams says the Department for Work and Pensions is currently carrying out ""124 process reviews following the deaths of 97 claimants"". She says there were 27 from serious harm, which represents a three fold increase since 2012. She says the government can't keep marking its own homework on claimant deaths. She asks him to meet her and those bereaved by the tragedies. She warns that some are of the belief that the 97 deaths could be ""the tip of the iceberg"". Boris Johnson says he will make sure she receives a full account of what the government is doing to ""put this right"". Later today, Lord Frost, the former chief Brexit negotiator
for the UK, will outline to the Lordshow the government wants to overhaul theNorthern Ireland Protocol. Since its introduction, it has caused supply issues in
Northern Ireland, leading to some areas experiencing food shortages. The Protocol helps prevent the need for checks on the land
border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. Lord Frost says the deal is unfair and unsustainable. The Protocol was negotiated by Lord Frost, but itâs expected
he will say the terms need to be radically changed. Labour's Stephen Timms raises the issue of Universal Credit and says plans to end the Â£20 a week top in the autumn up should not go ahead. Will the PM follow his own talk about ""levelling up"" and keep the increase? he asks. Boris Johnson says he wants to ""level up"" across the whole of the UK and get people off benefits and in to work. He says he wants to see higher wages. DUP MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson says in light of the judicial ruling in the High Court, that the Northern Ireland Protocol breaks the union, he asks what the government will do to ""fully remove the Irish Sea Border"". Boris Johnson congratulates Sir Jeffrey on becoming leader of the DUP. He says the government will be ""setting out today"" the steps that it will take to change the Northern Ireland Protocol. Nothing in the Protocol threatens the ""territorial integrity of the United Kingdom"", he states. SNP Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, raises the interview Dominic Cummings gave to the BBC and says it is clear the PM was pushing to ""allow the virus to run rampant"". How can anyone have faith in the PM, he asks? Mr Johnson says the substance of what he is alleged to have said is ""grossly mischaracterised"" and everyone in the country understands how difficult the decisions were that ministers had to take. There were ""no good ways through"", he says and there will be a full public inquiry to come. Blackford says the over 80s were expendable to the PM and his ""glib attitude"" to human life is not acceptable. He says ministers should be ""made to answer under oath"" and the inquiry should begin immediately before any general election is called. The PM says it is not right to ask people to devote time to an inquiry before the spring while they are still dealing with the pandemic. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer says the prime minister's answers have ""no resemblence to the questions I'm actually asking him"". He says all the PM needs to do ""is say sorry"". He says the PM has broken promises and has still has not unveiled a plan for social care, he's now raising working-age taxes while cutting the army and overseas aid. The PM has let the UK have one of the worst death rates and has a damaged economy, he states. He says there's a new three word slogan from the government this morning which is ""keep life moving"" - but says the slogan the government should be using is ""get a grip"". Boris Johnson says that thanks to the vaccine rollout nine million people have now come off furlough and unemployment is two million lower than predicted. And the PM says his three word slogan is ""get a jab"" while the government is turning ""jabs jabs jabs"" into ""jobs jobs jobs"". Itâs been an explosive set of revelations over the past 48
hours. On Monday morning, the BBC revealed it had secured an
interview with the former Downing Street aide, Dominic Cummings. The interview
was an hour long and was broadcast last night on BBC Two at 7pm. Cummings claimed in the interview,among other things: Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer says on 26 May, he asked the prime minister if he had ever used words to the effect that ""Covid was only killing over 80 year olds"". He says that on that day, the PM never outright denied using the words. He says with the revelation from former aide Dominic Cummings, citing messages between him and the PM, we can now see that the PM did say that. He asks if the prime minister will apologise for using those words. Boris Johnson says nothing he can say or do ""can make up for the loss and the suffering that people have endured during this pandemic"". He says when decisions were being made ""in those incredibly tough and dark times"" that the government had to try and balance the damage done by lockdown versus letting the virus spread.

from around the world: Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Authorities in Nanjing announced city-wide testing on Wednesday Part of a
major Chinese city has today gone into lockdown, after 17 airport workers
tested positive. According to
Chinaâs officialXinhua News Agency,external, employees at Nanjingâs Lukou International
Airport have tested positive. Nine of those are symptomatic. Flights have
subsequently been cancelled and 500 people have been placed under medical
observation. The local government today announced a citywide testing drive,
which will cover 9.3 million people. Four communities and villages in the city
have now become âmedium riskâ, meaning that local lockdown measures are in
place. Nanjing, in
eastern Jiangsu, is now one of two Chinese cities where there are lockdown
measures in place. There has been an outbreak since early July at the opposite
end of the country in a city called Ruili, which borders Myanmar. There are more
than 200 people currently in hospital in Yunnan province, many in the city of
Ruili. Today, a new testing drive has also been ordered there. Residents in
Ruili have already experienced multiple testing drives throughout the pandemic,
as the city has experienced four waves of the coronavirus. It has a population
of some 270,000 people. This video can not be played Inside India's deadly mucormycosis fungus epidemic Mucormycosis, a rare and deadly infection known as ""black fungus"", has killed more than 4,300 people in India, the health ministry has reported. The country has recorded 45,374 cases of the illness. Doctors say the fungus has a link with the steroids used to treat Covid, and diabetics are at particular risk. But the scale of the problem could be even greater. Dr Raghuraj Hegde, a Bangalore-based eye surgeon who has treated a number of mucormycosis patients, told the BBC that there had been ""massive undercounting of both cases and deaths"" from the disease. ""Typically, deaths in mucormycosis occur weeks to months after getting the disease. Our present systems are not good to capture that data,"" he said. You can read more about ithere Uptake of the coronavirus vaccine has been lower among ethnic minorities in Scotland, with African groups having the lowest levels of inoculation, the latest data shows. Rates are also lower among Asian Scots and those of Black or Caribbean heritage, figures from Public Health Scotland show. Other studies have found similarly lower levels of vaccination among ethnic minorities elsewhere in the UK. In Scotland, the difference has been most apparent in the 70 to 74 age range, where first dose uptake is 97.2% for the white ethnic group and 73.7% for the African ethnic group. For the Asian group in this age range, uptake was at 89.7% while the figure for Black or Caribbean Scots was 93.8%. While uptake was high in all age ranges among white Scots, it varied considerably among Black or Caribbean Scots, with uptake ranging from 96.0% in the over 80s to 46.0% in those aged 18-29 years. A further 44,104 people have tested positive for the coronavirus across the UK,government figures,externalshow. Another 73 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were also reported.  Over 39,000 people died of coronavirus in care home settings in England between 10 April 2020 and 31 March this year. Amanda Henry had been unable to see her father Robert, 78, for nearly four weeks - and when she was at last allowed into his care home in Poplar, east London, it was because he was gravely ill. Care homes were struggling to get personal protective equipment and the official guidance they needed. At the time Amanda just wanted to give him some comfort, but even then - in April 2020 - she says she noticed shortcomings with personal protective equipment (PPE). There was not enough of it, it was flimsy, and staff were not using it properly, she claims. Staff were going from room to room, not changing their PPE, not washing their hands between rooms, and some had no PPE at all, she says. ""What I was witnessing was the virus being spread amongst the residents of the care home in real time... ""I feel it tells us that these vulnerable elderly people were disposable to this government... ""I'm angry, I'm angry that my dad had to suffer like that."" Read morehere. More than 39,000 people died of coronavirus in care homes in England in the year from 10 April 2020 to 31 March 2021, new figures suggest. The numbers, released by the Care Quality Commission (CQC), show how the virus spread across the country. The highest number of deaths in a single care home was 44, while 21 homes had more than 30 Covid-related deaths. ""Every number represents a life lost,"" said Kate Terroni, CQC chief inspector for adult social care. Read morehere. The British Retail Consortium (BRC) has urged the government to ensure staff in stores and suppliers should be allowed to work even if they get an alert to self-isolate. The BRC's Andrew Opie said the ""pingdemic"" meant retailers were finding it difficult to maintain opening hours and keep shelves stocked. ""Government needs to act fast. Retail workers and suppliers, who have played a vital role throughout this pandemic, should be allowed to work provided they are double vaccinated or can show a negative Covid test, to ensure there is no disruption to the public's ability to get food and other goods,"" he said. The boss of Iceland supermarkets and leaders at pub chain Greene King have also called for new rulesto avoid crippling shutdowns. Croatia wants tourists to return, but has imposed mandatory testing rules for some Croatia has been on the UK's green list of countries for travel - the lowest level of restriction - since Monday. You can read about the rules for green, amber and red list countrieshere Croatia however has changed the rules for arrivals from the UK, as well as those from Cyprus and Russia. As of Monday 26 July, all visitors from these countries will need proof of a negative Covid test - regardless of whether they've been vaccinated or have proof of recovery from the virus. Tourism accounts for about 20% of the country's economy. But cases have been rising there over the last 10 days, particularly in areas along the Adriatic Coast. On Wednesday, authorities reported 191 new infections in Croatia. Sir Keir Starmer's self-isolation means four of the country's most senior politicians are now quarantining at home. Last week, Health Secretary Sajid Javid tested positive after feeling unwell, leading Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Chancellor Rishi Sunak to isolate at Chequers - the PM's house in Buckinghamshire -  and Downing Street respectively. It has been reported this week that Javid's positive test has forced a raft of senior No 10 and health department officials to self-isolate. It was initially announced that Johnson and Sunak would avoid having to self-isolate through a pilot daily testing programme, but this decisionwas reversed less than three hours later on Sunday. We know Sir Keir was in the Commons earlier for PMQs so it raises the question: if he goes on to develop Covid, how many other politicians will need to self-isolate? As it is announced Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer is to begin self-isolation after one of his children tested positive for Covid (seeearlier posts), let's re-cap the rules he will need to observe. While many restrictions on daily life have now lifted in England, stay-at-home orders for those in close contact with confirmed coronavirus cases have remained in place. Currently, you must self-isolate for 10 days if you test positive, live with someone who tests positive, are told to isolate by NHS Test and Trace, or someone you live with has symptoms. Some fully vaccinated critical workers in England - including health and care staff - will be able to leave isolation to go to work, even if they are traced as a contact of someone with Covid. But these people are specifically named on a letter from a government department in advance of any potential self-isolation order. Changes to the rules around self-isolation for people who are fully vaccinated are due to begin from 16 August in England. Read more about the current ruleshere. The BBC Proms will go ahead at full capacity this year, with audience members ""strongly encouraged"" to wear masks. They will also be required to provide a negative lateral flow test, a positive PCR test or proof of double vaccination. Promming tickets, where audience members can stand in the arena or gallery areas of the Royal Albert Hall, will also be available on the day of each concert. The 2020 edition featured a reduced orchestra playing to an empty auditorium - with the singers placed in the stalls. The return of the fully-fledged event will feature52 concerts over 44 days featuring 30 orchestras and ensembles, more than 100 soloists and conductors and more than 2,000 musicians. The BBC says: ""The safety of our audiences is our main priority and we are taking every step we can to open the Proms safely without social distancing."" Audience members over the age of 18 will be asked to provide a negative lateral flow test taken within 48 hours of the performance, or evidence of double vaccination provided via the NHS app or a letter provided by the NHS. They can also offer proof of natural immunity based upon a positive PCR test taken within 180 days of the performance. Under 18s will be asked for verbal confirmation from a parent or guardian that they have not received a positive test. The BBC Proms opens on 30 July and runs until 11 September. The news that Sir Keir Starmer has begun self-isolation comes just hours after he described a ""summer of chaos"" amid soaring numbers of people self-isolating at home. Starmer dubbed PM Boris Johnson - who is himself self-isolating in Buckinghamshire - the ""Chequers one"" as he mocked Johnson's isolation on the same week most remaining curbs lifted in England. Speaking in the Commons, Starmer said: ""Everything may be calm from the prime minister's country retreat but back here the truth is we're heading for a summer of chaos."" It is the fourth time Labour leader has self-isolated after coming in close contact with a confirmed Covid case since the pandemic began. Starmer isolated inJanuary,December and September last year after being notified that an associate had tested positive. Given his child's positive test came at lunchtime, Starmer may have to self-isolate until 31 July - potentially throwing into doubt any plans his family might have made for a summer holiday. The House of Commons goes into recess tomorrow. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer is to self-isolate after one of his children tested positive, a spokesman says. ""One of Keir's children tested positive for Covid this lunchtime. In line with the rules, Keir and his family will now be self-isolating,"" they said. ""Keir was already doing daily tests and tested negative this morning. He will continue to take daily tests."" Earlier we told you of some of the big name businesses forced to close or reduce services because of the ""pingdemic"". But it's not just household names affected - smaller businesses have told of the disruption caused when staff have to self-isolate. Mrs Salisbury's Tea Rooms in Maldon, Essex is closed until Saturday as co-owner Mike Bloomfield and five staff - half the workforce - are self-isolating after being in contact with a positive Covid case. He says: ""Luckily everybody is negative [for Covid-19] and doing fine at the moment but we still have to do what we have to do and isolate."" Sean Hughes Sean Hughes, who owns pubs in St Albans, says he has been forced to close The Boot due to one member of staff being contacted by NHS Test and Trace and others being pinged by the app. ""We have reduced hours and closed the kitchen for most of this week until they can come back. ""All tests thus far showing negative on a daily basis. It is a complete mess."" You can read more reaction from businesses ownershere. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Nearly a quarter of Taiwan's population have reportedly received one vaccine dose In the last 24 hours, Taiwan has confirmed 16 new local
cases and five further deaths. It has now been five days that Taiwan has
recorded fewer than 20 local cases. Covid-19 restrictions are set to end on Monday, so in the
next couple of days, the Central Epidemic Command Centre will decide whether or
not to relax indoor and outdoor gathering limits, after two months of near
lockdown. Currently, five people are allowed to gather indoors, and 10
outdoors. Since 20 May, all of Taiwan has been in Level 3
restrictions. This is where all but essential businesses are closed, and
mask-wearing is mandatory. Recently, as cases have eased,some sports and entertainment venues have been allowed to reopen. Vaccination is escalating in Taiwan, so the hope is that
this recent, severe wave of Covid-19 will be the last.Local media report,externalthat
23.5% of Taiwanâs 23.5m population have now had one dose of either AstraZeneca
and Moderna. There are warnings, however, that some vaccinations may have
to be postponed in the coming days, due to multiple typhoon warnings. Thanks to early border closures and strict regulations, Taiwan has kept cases relatively low throughout the pandemic. According to Johns Hopkins University it has recorded 15,453 cases and 773 deaths. Â© 2025 BBC.

"The UK has unveiled a new set of demands to redraw the post-Brexit trading arrangements it agreed with the EU for Northern Ireland. The government said border checks on goods from Great Britain it signed up to in the 2019 Brexit divorce deal had proved unsustainable. Brexit Minister Lord Frost said they risked harming business, and were damaging the ""fabric"" of the UK. The EU said it would not agree to renegotiate the terms of the 2019 deal. The checks are included in the Northern Ireland Protocol, a section of the Brexit deal designed to avoid border checks on the island of Ireland. Lord Frost called on the EU to look on the UK's proposals with ""fresh eyes,"" adding: ""We cannot go on as we are."" M&S to cut Christmas products in Northern Ireland No renegotiation on Protocol as UK warns of action DUP leader calls for renegotiation of Brexit deal What is the Northern Ireland Protocol? However, he announced the UK would not be triggering Article 16 of the protocol - which would allow it to suspend parts of the Brexit deal - before talks with Brussels. He added that the government believed using it was justifiable, but said: ""Nevertheless, we have concluded that it is not the right moment to do so."" Lord Frost told the House of Lords there was a ""growing sense in Northern Ireland we have not found the right balance, seen in an ongoing febrile political climate, protests and regrettable instances of occasional disorder"". He also called on the EU to agree a ""standstill period"" to prevent a ban on sending chilled meat products such as sausages from Great Britain coming into force in September, when the full terms of the deal kick in. He later told reporters it was ""perfectly normal to change treaties in the light of experience, and it happens all the time"". In a28-page document,external, the UK government suggested changes to: remove customs checks on goods where the GB-registered businesses sending them have declared their final destination is Northern Ireland get rid of certificates and checks for food products ""only ever intended to be consumed in Northern Ireland"" remove medicines entirely from the scope of the protocol allowing labelled goods conforming to UK rules to circulate freely in Northern Ireland alongside EU-registered products The future of the Irish border was a huge sticking point during Brexit talks The protocol was agreed to prevent the return of a hard border between the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland, as both the UK and EU want to prevent any return to the Troubles, which lasted 30 years and cost more than 3,500 lives. Under its terms, Northern Ireland effectivelyremains part of the EU's single market,externalfor goods, meaning it complies with standards set by Brussels. The biggest practical difficulty, in trade terms, concerns the movement of food from Britain to Northern Ireland, which could then be transported into the EU via the Irish land border. The prime minister's former chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, has told BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg that the protocol had been a ""fudge"". Both sides had wanted to ""sign up to something that was not what either side really wanted and which punted difficult questions into the future to figure out later"", he added. This video can not be played Brexit deal was ""inherently self-contradictory in various ways,"" says Dominic Cummings European Commission Vice-President MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ said the EU was willing to ""seek creative solutions within the framework of the protocol"" to ease border issues. But he added the 27-member union would not agree to a ""renegotiation"" of the Brexit deal. ""Respecting international legal obligations is of paramount importance,"" he added. DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said: ""We welcome the acceptance from the government that the protocol is not working, that it is causing real harm to our economy in Northern Ireland and it is simply not sustainable."" He called the UK government's statement - and its publication of a command paper describing its demands - an ""important first step"". However, Sinn Fein Brexit spokesperson Declan Kearney called on the UK government to ""stop the evasion"" and ""get on"" with implementing the deal it agreed. ""It is not acceptable for the Tories to adopt an a la carte approach towards the protocol, to rewrite history, and now attempt a renegotiation,"" he added. Industry group Manufacturing NI said the UK's proposals would create ""confusion and uncertainty for business"" and were likely to ""create conflict with the EU"". It called on the EU to ""go further to ensure the UK's market works for business and consumers in Northern Ireland"". ""Both parties owe it to the people in Northern Ireland to skip the drama and get on with dialogue and decision making,"" the body added. For Labour, Brexit spokeswoman Baroness Chapman urged the government to ""fix the problems the prime minister created"".

"This video can not be played Commuters and children rescued from China floodwaters Twelve people have died after record-breaking rainfall flooded underground railway tunnels in China, leaving passengers trapped in rising waters. Video shared on social media shows evening commuters just managing to keep their heads above water. Water is seen rushing onto platforms. More than 500 people were eventually rescued from the tunnels in Henan province, officials said. Days of rain have caused widespread damage and led to 200,000 evacuations. Above ground, roads have been turned into rivers, with cars and debris swept along in fast moving currents. A number ofpedestrians have had to be rescued. In total, 25 people have died in Henan province and more than a dozen cities are affected. President Xi Jinping said on Wednesday that there had been ""significant loss of life and damage to property"". Several dams and reservoirs have breached warning levels, and soldiers have been mobilised to divert rivers which have burst their banks. Flights and trains in many parts of Henan have also been suspended. In the provincial capital  Zhengzhou, the equivalent of a year's average rainfall has fallen in just three days. On Tuesday, some of the city's flood defences were overwhelmed and water began flowing down into the railway tunnels. Survivors have described how water leaked through the doors, rising slowly from ""our ankles to our knees to our necks"". ""All of us who could, stood on the subway seats,"" one woman wrote on Chinese social network site Weibo. Science failed to predict flood and heat intensity Record heat points to 'extraordinary' extremes Children were lifted out of the water by their parents, while others threw off anything which might hold them down. After about half an hour, one passenger said it became ""hard to breathe"". An order to shut down the line came at 18:10 local time (10:10 GMT) so the evacuation could begin, Zhengzhou government officials said in a statement. Five people are being treated for injuries, with 12 having died. Elsewhere in the central Chinese city, children had to be rescued from a flooded nursery school.

"MPs question Boris Johnson as he faces the Commons in the weekly PMQs He is currently isolating at Chequers, after coming into contact with the health secretary, who has Covid Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer asks about his decision to isolate after initially saying he was taking part in a testing scheme instead The PM says people must isolate if contacted, and says the government is concentrating on rolling out the vaccine programme He is also asked about Dominic Cummings' assertion that he resisted lockdown last autumn as the people dying from it were ""essentially all over 80"" The PM says he has done whatever he could to save lives - and followed scientific advice at every turn It's the 60th anniversary of PMQs - the inaugural session was 18 July 1961 - and the last before Parliament goes into recess Industry is warning over rising Covid cases and requests for people to isolate Later today, ministers will unveil how they want to overhaul trading arrangements between Britain and Northern Ireland that came into effect after Brexit Georgina Pattinson That's where we leave our coverage of PMQs for today - it was the final session before MPs head on their summer recess. Thanks for joining us and we'll see you again after the break, when MPs return. Bye for now. During Prime Minister's Questions, Boris Johnson came under fire from MPs for the continuing rules on self-isolation. Downing Street says that self-isolating is ""crucial"" if you are told to do so by the NHS Covid-19 app. The remarks were made after Business Minister Paul Scully previously said he would ""encourage"" people to self-isolate but the app was there to let people make an ""informed decision"". Keir Starmer accused the PM of being a ""super spreader"" of confusion over Covid rules. Meanwhile, Richard Burgon, a Labour MP, asked if statutory sick pay of Â£96 a week was enough to help people self-isolate. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Reality Check At Prime Ministerâs Questions
today, Keir Starmer said that the UK has âthe
highest death toll in Europe"". As we have reportedbefore, that is correct: the UK
has reported the largest number of deaths of any country in Europe. But it does not take into
account population size. Some smaller countries have reported higher rates of
deaths per 100,000 people. The UK did have the worst
figures across most measures in the first wave of coronavirus, but has since
been overtaken by countries that had worse winters. Chair of the Conservative Party, Amanda Milling, is on BBC Two's Politics Live. She is asked about Dominic Cummings'comments about the PM's allegedly resisting lockdown as he said only 'over 80s' were dying. Keir Starmer and Ian Blackford raised it at PMQs - and she's whether she will apologise on the PM's behalf. She says lockdowns are not just about health but about the impact on business and people's mental health and as a result are really difficult decisions. She says the public recognise how hard these decisions were and her ""heart goes out to those who have lost loved ones"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Lib Dem Sarah Olney says her daughter was among the one million children out of school last week due to the need to self-isolate when there was a positive case in their bubble. She asks if the PM can confirm that his approach to managing the virus will guarantee that all children will have an uninterrupted return to their learning after the summer break. Boris Johnson says the needs of children in this pandemic are the focus and it is of ""paramount importance"" to keep them in school. He says ministers will do everything they can to get schools back in September and he has every confidence they will be, but everyone offered a jab must get vaccinated. Richard Burgon - a Labour MP - says the PM is ""having to self isolate just as hundreds of thousands of people across the country are having to do thanks to his mismanagement of the pandemic"". He says not everyone has access to a country estate with a heated swimming pool (a dig at Johnson, who is self-isolating at Chequers). He asks if the PM could survive on Â£96 sick pay per week. Boris Johnson says everyone who is self-isolating has access to the equivalent of the living wage, which is sick pay. He says some people can get additional Â£500 payments to help them with staying at home. Conservative Selaine Saxby says people want to come to her north Devon constituency but what  assurances can the PM give to residents that planning reforms will protect them against second home buyers? She says unless protections are in place, ""vibrant coastal communities"" will become ""winter ghost towns"". The PM says the government has brought in a series of measures such as higher rates of stamp duty on the buying of additional properties. And he says his strategy is to make sure people growing up around the country have the chance of home ownership in the place where they live. Labour MP Debbie Abrahams says the Department for Work and Pensions is currently carrying out ""124 process reviews following the deaths of 97 claimants"". She says there were 27 from serious harm, which represents a three fold increase since 2012. She says the government can't keep marking its own homework on claimant deaths. She asks him to meet her and those bereaved by the tragedies. She warns that some are of the belief that the 97 deaths could be ""the tip of the iceberg"". Boris Johnson says he will make sure she receives a full account of what the government is doing to ""put this right"". Later today, Lord Frost, the former chief Brexit negotiator
for the UK, will outline to the Lordshow the government wants to overhaul theNorthern Ireland Protocol. Since its introduction, it has caused supply issues in
Northern Ireland, leading to some areas experiencing food shortages. The Protocol helps prevent the need for checks on the land
border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. Lord Frost says the deal is unfair and unsustainable. The Protocol was negotiated by Lord Frost, but itâs expected
he will say the terms need to be radically changed. Labour's Stephen Timms raises the issue of Universal Credit and says plans to end the Â£20 a week top in the autumn up should not go ahead. Will the PM follow his own talk about ""levelling up"" and keep the increase? he asks. Boris Johnson says he wants to ""level up"" across the whole of the UK and get people off benefits and in to work. He says he wants to see higher wages. DUP MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson says in light of the judicial ruling in the High Court, that the Northern Ireland Protocol breaks the union, he asks what the government will do to ""fully remove the Irish Sea Border"". Boris Johnson congratulates Sir Jeffrey on becoming leader of the DUP. He says the government will be ""setting out today"" the steps that it will take to change the Northern Ireland Protocol. Nothing in the Protocol threatens the ""territorial integrity of the United Kingdom"", he states. SNP Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, raises the interview Dominic Cummings gave to the BBC and says it is clear the PM was pushing to ""allow the virus to run rampant"". How can anyone have faith in the PM, he asks? Mr Johnson says the substance of what he is alleged to have said is ""grossly mischaracterised"" and everyone in the country understands how difficult the decisions were that ministers had to take. There were ""no good ways through"", he says and there will be a full public inquiry to come. Blackford says the over 80s were expendable to the PM and his ""glib attitude"" to human life is not acceptable. He says ministers should be ""made to answer under oath"" and the inquiry should begin immediately before any general election is called. The PM says it is not right to ask people to devote time to an inquiry before the spring while they are still dealing with the pandemic. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer says the prime minister's answers have ""no resemblence to the questions I'm actually asking him"". He says all the PM needs to do ""is say sorry"". He says the PM has broken promises and has still has not unveiled a plan for social care, he's now raising working-age taxes while cutting the army and overseas aid. The PM has let the UK have one of the worst death rates and has a damaged economy, he states. He says there's a new three word slogan from the government this morning which is ""keep life moving"" - but says the slogan the government should be using is ""get a grip"". Boris Johnson says that thanks to the vaccine rollout nine million people have now come off furlough and unemployment is two million lower than predicted. And the PM says his three word slogan is ""get a jab"" while the government is turning ""jabs jabs jabs"" into ""jobs jobs jobs"". Itâs been an explosive set of revelations over the past 48
hours. On Monday morning, the BBC revealed it had secured an
interview with the former Downing Street aide, Dominic Cummings. The interview
was an hour long and was broadcast last night on BBC Two at 7pm. Cummings claimed in the interview,among other things: Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer says on 26 May, he asked the prime minister if he had ever used words to the effect that ""Covid was only killing over 80 year olds"". He says that on that day, the PM never outright denied using the words. He says with the revelation from former aide Dominic Cummings, citing messages between him and the PM, we can now see that the PM did say that. He asks if the prime minister will apologise for using those words. Boris Johnson says nothing he can say or do ""can make up for the loss and the suffering that people have endured during this pandemic"". He says when decisions were being made ""in those incredibly tough and dark times"" that the government had to try and balance the damage done by lockdown versus letting the virus spread.

today, Keir Starmer said that the UK has âthe
highest death toll in Europe"". As we have reportedbefore, that is correct: the UK
has reported the largest number of deaths of any country in Europe. But it does not take into

deaths per 100,000 people. The UK did have the worst
figures across most measures in the first wave of coronavirus, but has since
been overtaken by countries that had worse winters. Chair of the Conservative Party, Amanda Milling, is on BBC Two's Politics Live.

Lib Dem Sarah Olney says her daughter was among the one million children out of school last week due to the need to self-isolate when there was a positive case in their bubble. She asks if the PM can confirm that his approach to managing the virus will guarantee that all children will have an uninterrupted return to their learning after the summer break. Boris Johnson says the needs of children in this pandemic are the focus and it is of ""paramount importance"" to keep them in school. He says ministers will do everything they can to get schools back in September and he has every confidence they will be, but everyone offered a jab must get vaccinated. Richard Burgon - a Labour MP - says the PM is ""having to self isolate just as hundreds of thousands of people across the country are having to do thanks to his mismanagement of the pandemic"". He says not everyone has access to a country estate with a heated swimming pool (a dig at Johnson, who is self-isolating at Chequers). He asks if the PM could survive on Â£96 sick pay per week. Boris Johnson says everyone who is self-isolating has access to the equivalent of the living wage, which is sick pay. He says some people can get additional Â£500 payments to help them with staying at home. Conservative Selaine Saxby says people want to come to her north Devon constituency but what  assurances can the PM give to residents that planning reforms will protect them against second home buyers? She says unless protections are in place, ""vibrant coastal communities"" will become ""winter ghost towns"". The PM says the government has brought in a series of measures such as higher rates of stamp duty on the buying of additional properties. And he says his strategy is to make sure people growing up around the country have the chance of home ownership in the place where they live. Labour MP Debbie Abrahams says the Department for Work and Pensions is currently carrying out ""124 process reviews following the deaths of 97 claimants"". She says there were 27 from serious harm, which represents a three fold increase since 2012. She says the government can't keep marking its own homework on claimant deaths. She asks him to meet her and those bereaved by the tragedies. She warns that some are of the belief that the 97 deaths could be ""the tip of the iceberg"". Boris Johnson says he will make sure she receives a full account of what the government is doing to ""put this right"". Later today, Lord Frost, the former chief Brexit negotiator
for the UK, will outline to the Lordshow the government wants to overhaul theNorthern Ireland Protocol. Since its introduction, it has caused supply issues in
Northern Ireland, leading to some areas experiencing food shortages. The Protocol helps prevent the need for checks on the land
border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. Lord Frost says the deal is unfair and unsustainable. The Protocol was negotiated by Lord Frost, but itâs expected
he will say the terms need to be radically changed. Labour's Stephen Timms raises the issue of Universal Credit and says plans to end the Â£20 a week top in the autumn up should not go ahead. Will the PM follow his own talk about ""levelling up"" and keep the increase? he asks. Boris Johnson says he wants to ""level up"" across the whole of the UK and get people off benefits and in to work. He says he wants to see higher wages. DUP MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson says in light of the judicial ruling in the High Court, that the Northern Ireland Protocol breaks the union, he asks what the government will do to ""fully remove the Irish Sea Border"". Boris Johnson congratulates Sir Jeffrey on becoming leader of the DUP. He says the government will be ""setting out today"" the steps that it will take to change the Northern Ireland Protocol. Nothing in the Protocol threatens the ""territorial integrity of the United Kingdom"", he states. SNP Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, raises the interview Dominic Cummings gave to the BBC and says it is clear the PM was pushing to ""allow the virus to run rampant"". How can anyone have faith in the PM, he asks? Mr Johnson says the substance of what he is alleged to have said is ""grossly mischaracterised"" and everyone in the country understands how difficult the decisions were that ministers had to take. There were ""no good ways through"", he says and there will be a full public inquiry to come. Blackford says the over 80s were expendable to the PM and his ""glib attitude"" to human life is not acceptable. He says ministers should be ""made to answer under oath"" and the inquiry should begin immediately before any general election is called. The PM says it is not right to ask people to devote time to an inquiry before the spring while they are still dealing with the pandemic. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer says the prime minister's answers have ""no resemblence to the questions I'm actually asking him"". He says all the PM needs to do ""is say sorry"". He says the PM has broken promises and has still has not unveiled a plan for social care, he's now raising working-age taxes while cutting the army and overseas aid. The PM has let the UK have one of the worst death rates and has a damaged economy, he states. He says there's a new three word slogan from the government this morning which is ""keep life moving"" - but says the slogan the government should be using is ""get a grip"". Boris Johnson says that thanks to the vaccine rollout nine million people have now come off furlough and unemployment is two million lower than predicted. And the PM says his three word slogan is ""get a jab"" while the government is turning ""jabs jabs jabs"" into ""jobs jobs jobs"". Itâs been an explosive set of revelations over the past 48
hours. On Monday morning, the BBC revealed it had secured an
interview with the former Downing Street aide, Dominic Cummings. The interview
was an hour long and was broadcast last night on BBC Two at 7pm. Cummings claimed in the interview,among other things: Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer says on 26 May, he asked the prime minister if he had ever used words to the effect that ""Covid was only killing over 80 year olds"". He says that on that day, the PM never outright denied using the words. He says with the revelation from former aide Dominic Cummings, citing messages between him and the PM, we can now see that the PM did say that. He asks if the prime minister will apologise for using those words. Boris Johnson says nothing he can say or do ""can make up for the loss and the suffering that people have endured during this pandemic"". He says when decisions were being made ""in those incredibly tough and dark times"" that the government had to try and balance the damage done by lockdown versus letting the virus spread.

"Marks & Spencer has warned it is already cutting Christmas products in Northern Ireland due to concerns over forthcoming post-Brexit customs checks. Chairman Archie Norman told Radio Four's Today Programme the changes could mean higher prices and less choice for Northern Ireland customers. Mr Norman said current ""pointless"" checks with the Republic of Ireland were ""threatening"" to its business. He called for a ""common sense approach to enforcement."" TheUK is expected later to warn the EU it is prepared to unilaterally override the Brexit arrangements for Northern Ireland if a simplified agreement cannot be reached. Right now, supermarkets who send products there from Great Britain face only light-touch checks, under a so-called ""grace period"" which delayed some of the new processes. That runs out at the end of September. The Northern Ireland Protocol helps prevent the need for checks on the island of Ireland's internal border. But in the first warning from a major retailer on the scale of the potential problems, former Conservative party MP Mr Norman said once light-touch export checks end, there will be ""gaps on the shelves"". ""This Christmas, I can tell you already, we're having to make decisions to delist product for Northern Ireland because it's simply not worth the risk of trying to get it through,"" he said. ""We've already made that decision. We're waiting to see how serious it's going to be but if it's anything like southern Ireland (the Republic of Ireland), and at the moment it's set to be, then it's going to be very, very serious for customers."" Marks and Spencer is a major employer in Ireland, with more than 4,000 staff. In a letter to Brexit minister Lord Frost, Mr Norman said the current EU customs arrangements were ""totally unsuited and were never designed for a modern fresh food supply chain between closely intertwined trading partners"". ""There is no other outcome for consumers in Northern Ireland in the end other than higher prices, given the inflationary pressures being put on to retailers by the regulatory regime,"" Mr Norman wrote. ""Being able to keep the show on the road, let alone growing, is going to be very challenging,"" he added. Mr Norman told the BBC that ""pettifogging enforcement"" of the rules required M&S to employ 14 full-time vets, ""simply ticking boxes and filling out forms"", in order to certify its products. ""Sandwiches typically require three veterinary certificates to get through,"" he said. Because of the way the system worked, M&S had had to give up exporting half its sandwich range to Ireland, he said. If forms were filled in incorrectly, that meant delays, with everything on paper and nothing digital, Mr Norman said. ""If one page is blue instead of black typeface, the entire wagon is turned away,"" he added. Mr Norman said that if the same regime was replicated in Northern Ireland at the end of September, it would be ""incendiary"" for the public there. What's the Northern Ireland Protocol? DUP sets out seven tests for NI Brexit deal M&S marks 50 years of trading in Belfast Mr Norman said M&S was one of the largest UK-based retailers operating in Ireland as a whole and played ""a disproportionate role"" in Northern Ireland. ""Our market share in Northern Ireland is almost double our share on the UK mainland. In part, this reflects our history as the only major UK retailer that committed to trade and invest continuously through the Troubles,"" he said. ""Our commitment and involvement with the people and communities of Northern Ireland remains strong. We are also a major employer and investor with over 4,000 people employed directly by M&S and many more in our supply chain."" He added that last year, M&S invested more than Â£10m in the business in Northern Ireland. However, the issues raised by the current customs arrangements, in which Northern Ireland remains part of the EU Single Market while the rest of the UK has left, were ""very threatening to our business"", he said. Ireland's European affairs minister Thomas Byrne said it was willing to discuss ""any creative solutions"". ""But we have to recognise as well that Britain decided itself to leave the single market of the European Union, to apply trade rules, to apply red tape to its goods that are leaving Britain, to goods that are coming into Britain,"" he added. The EU has said a temporary Swiss-style veterinary agreement for Northern Ireland, in which the UK continues to follow EU agri-food rules, could be a solution, but it has been rejected by the UK. In his letter, Mr Norman said he understood why the UK government was ""not favourably disposed"" to this solution, although he added that it was ""by far the best way of delivering a smooth trade flow"". Regardless of this, he added, many problems could be solved by a willingness to overlook ""trivial"" errors in paperwork and efforts to set up a ""trusted trader"" scheme. ""Any scheme should start on the basis that we are prepared to follow EU standards for products going to Northern Ireland,"" he said. ""The debate is not about meeting standards, this is about what we are required to do to show we are compliant."" Number 10 said Mr Norman's letter was a ""stark warning"" of ""the fundamental problems with the Protocol"". ""That is why we need to urgently tackle these issues, to ensure there is minimal disruption to people's lives in Northern Ireland, as the Protocol itself intended,"" it added. It plans to set out details later on its approach to the Northern Ireland Protocol. The sort of products M&S is considering taking off the list for Northern Ireland this Christmas are ones containing a lot of different ingredients. For example, special occasion food like pies or pates, which people might order for a celebration. Today, the company's chairman wants to send a message that the way post-Brexit rules on trade with EU countries have been implemented is making it extremely difficult to get products over to the Republic of Ireland, forcing the retailer to cut back the range it sells there. And he fears Northern Ireland is heading the same way. It won't be a co-incidence that Archie Norman's intervention comes just before we expect to hear more on the government's proposals. He presents an argument for introducing less disruptive trade processes after the grace periods expire. Whether the EU will accept that is a whole other question.

She asks if the PM can confirm that his approach to managing the virus will guarantee that all children will have an uninterrupted return to their learning after the summer break. Boris Johnson says the needs of children in this pandemic are the focus and it is of ""paramount importance"" to keep them in school. He says ministers will do everything they can to get schools back in September and he has every confidence they will be, but everyone offered a jab must get vaccinated. Richard Burgon - a Labour MP - says the PM is ""having to self isolate just as hundreds of thousands of people across the country are having to do thanks to his mismanagement of the pandemic"". He says not everyone has access to a country estate with a heated swimming pool (a dig at Johnson, who is self-isolating at Chequers). He asks if the PM could survive on Â£96 sick pay per week. Boris Johnson says everyone who is self-isolating has access to the equivalent of the living wage, which is sick pay. He says some people can get additional Â£500 payments to help them with staying at home. Conservative Selaine Saxby says people want to come to her north Devon constituency but what  assurances can the PM give to residents that planning reforms will protect them against second home buyers? She says unless protections are in place, ""vibrant coastal communities"" will become ""winter ghost towns"". The PM says the government has brought in a series of measures such as higher rates of stamp duty on the buying of additional properties. And he says his strategy is to make sure people growing up around the country have the chance of home ownership in the place where they live. Labour MP Debbie Abrahams says the Department for Work and Pensions is currently carrying out ""124 process reviews following the deaths of 97 claimants"". She says there were 27 from serious harm, which represents a three fold increase since 2012. She says the government can't keep marking its own homework on claimant deaths. She asks him to meet her and those bereaved by the tragedies. She warns that some are of the belief that the 97 deaths could be ""the tip of the iceberg"". Boris Johnson says he will make sure she receives a full account of what the government is doing to ""put this right"". Later today, Lord Frost, the former chief Brexit negotiator
for the UK, will outline to the Lordshow the government wants to overhaul theNorthern Ireland Protocol. Since its introduction, it has caused supply issues in
Northern Ireland, leading to some areas experiencing food shortages. The Protocol helps prevent the need for checks on the land
border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. Lord Frost says the deal is unfair and unsustainable. The Protocol was negotiated by Lord Frost, but itâs expected
he will say the terms need to be radically changed. Labour's Stephen Timms raises the issue of Universal Credit and says plans to end the Â£20 a week top in the autumn up should not go ahead. Will the PM follow his own talk about ""levelling up"" and keep the increase? he asks. Boris Johnson says he wants to ""level up"" across the whole of the UK and get people off benefits and in to work. He says he wants to see higher wages. DUP MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson says in light of the judicial ruling in the High Court, that the Northern Ireland Protocol breaks the union, he asks what the government will do to ""fully remove the Irish Sea Border"". Boris Johnson congratulates Sir Jeffrey on becoming leader of the DUP. He says the government will be ""setting out today"" the steps that it will take to change the Northern Ireland Protocol. Nothing in the Protocol threatens the ""territorial integrity of the United Kingdom"", he states. SNP Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, raises the interview Dominic Cummings gave to the BBC and says it is clear the PM was pushing to ""allow the virus to run rampant"". How can anyone have faith in the PM, he asks? Mr Johnson says the substance of what he is alleged to have said is ""grossly mischaracterised"" and everyone in the country understands how difficult the decisions were that ministers had to take. There were ""no good ways through"", he says and there will be a full public inquiry to come. Blackford says the over 80s were expendable to the PM and his ""glib attitude"" to human life is not acceptable. He says ministers should be ""made to answer under oath"" and the inquiry should begin immediately before any general election is called. The PM says it is not right to ask people to devote time to an inquiry before the spring while they are still dealing with the pandemic. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer says the prime minister's answers have ""no resemblence to the questions I'm actually asking him"". He says all the PM needs to do ""is say sorry"". He says the PM has broken promises and has still has not unveiled a plan for social care, he's now raising working-age taxes while cutting the army and overseas aid. The PM has let the UK have one of the worst death rates and has a damaged economy, he states. He says there's a new three word slogan from the government this morning which is ""keep life moving"" - but says the slogan the government should be using is ""get a grip"". Boris Johnson says that thanks to the vaccine rollout nine million people have now come off furlough and unemployment is two million lower than predicted. And the PM says his three word slogan is ""get a jab"" while the government is turning ""jabs jabs jabs"" into ""jobs jobs jobs"". Itâs been an explosive set of revelations over the past 48
hours. On Monday morning, the BBC revealed it had secured an
interview with the former Downing Street aide, Dominic Cummings. The interview
was an hour long and was broadcast last night on BBC Two at 7pm. Cummings claimed in the interview,among other things: Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer says on 26 May, he asked the prime minister if he had ever used words to the effect that ""Covid was only killing over 80 year olds"". He says that on that day, the PM never outright denied using the words. He says with the revelation from former aide Dominic Cummings, citing messages between him and the PM, we can now see that the PM did say that. He asks if the prime minister will apologise for using those words. Boris Johnson says nothing he can say or do ""can make up for the loss and the suffering that people have endured during this pandemic"". He says when decisions were being made ""in those incredibly tough and dark times"" that the government had to try and balance the damage done by lockdown versus letting the virus spread.

from around the world: Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Authorities in Nanjing announced city-wide testing on Wednesday Part of a
major Chinese city has today gone into lockdown, after 17 airport workers
tested positive. According to
Chinaâs officialXinhua News Agency,external, employees at Nanjingâs Lukou International
Airport have tested positive. Nine of those are symptomatic. Flights have
subsequently been cancelled and 500 people have been placed under medical
observation. The local government today announced a citywide testing drive,
which will cover 9.3 million people. Four communities and villages in the city
have now become âmedium riskâ, meaning that local lockdown measures are in
place. Nanjing, in
eastern Jiangsu, is now one of two Chinese cities where there are lockdown
measures in place. There has been an outbreak since early July at the opposite
end of the country in a city called Ruili, which borders Myanmar. There are more
than 200 people currently in hospital in Yunnan province, many in the city of
Ruili. Today, a new testing drive has also been ordered there. Residents in
Ruili have already experienced multiple testing drives throughout the pandemic,
as the city has experienced four waves of the coronavirus. It has a population
of some 270,000 people. This video can not be played Inside India's deadly mucormycosis fungus epidemic Mucormycosis, a rare and deadly infection known as ""black fungus"", has killed more than 4,300 people in India, the health ministry has reported. The country has recorded 45,374 cases of the illness. Doctors say the fungus has a link with the steroids used to treat Covid, and diabetics are at particular risk. But the scale of the problem could be even greater. Dr Raghuraj Hegde, a Bangalore-based eye surgeon who has treated a number of mucormycosis patients, told the BBC that there had been ""massive undercounting of both cases and deaths"" from the disease. ""Typically, deaths in mucormycosis occur weeks to months after getting the disease. Our present systems are not good to capture that data,"" he said. You can read more about ithere Uptake of the coronavirus vaccine has been lower among ethnic minorities in Scotland, with African groups having the lowest levels of inoculation, the latest data shows. Rates are also lower among Asian Scots and those of Black or Caribbean heritage, figures from Public Health Scotland show. Other studies have found similarly lower levels of vaccination among ethnic minorities elsewhere in the UK. In Scotland, the difference has been most apparent in the 70 to 74 age range, where first dose uptake is 97.2% for the white ethnic group and 73.7% for the African ethnic group. For the Asian group in this age range, uptake was at 89.7% while the figure for Black or Caribbean Scots was 93.8%. While uptake was high in all age ranges among white Scots, it varied considerably among Black or Caribbean Scots, with uptake ranging from 96.0% in the over 80s to 46.0% in those aged 18-29 years. A further 44,104 people have tested positive for the coronavirus across the UK,government figures,externalshow. Another 73 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were also reported.  Over 39,000 people died of coronavirus in care home settings in England between 10 April 2020 and 31 March this year. Amanda Henry had been unable to see her father Robert, 78, for nearly four weeks - and when she was at last allowed into his care home in Poplar, east London, it was because he was gravely ill. Care homes were struggling to get personal protective equipment and the official guidance they needed. At the time Amanda just wanted to give him some comfort, but even then - in April 2020 - she says she noticed shortcomings with personal protective equipment (PPE). There was not enough of it, it was flimsy, and staff were not using it properly, she claims. Staff were going from room to room, not changing their PPE, not washing their hands between rooms, and some had no PPE at all, she says. ""What I was witnessing was the virus being spread amongst the residents of the care home in real time... ""I feel it tells us that these vulnerable elderly people were disposable to this government... ""I'm angry, I'm angry that my dad had to suffer like that."" Read morehere. More than 39,000 people died of coronavirus in care homes in England in the year from 10 April 2020 to 31 March 2021, new figures suggest. The numbers, released by the Care Quality Commission (CQC), show how the virus spread across the country. The highest number of deaths in a single care home was 44, while 21 homes had more than 30 Covid-related deaths. ""Every number represents a life lost,"" said Kate Terroni, CQC chief inspector for adult social care. Read morehere. The British Retail Consortium (BRC) has urged the government to ensure staff in stores and suppliers should be allowed to work even if they get an alert to self-isolate. The BRC's Andrew Opie said the ""pingdemic"" meant retailers were finding it difficult to maintain opening hours and keep shelves stocked. ""Government needs to act fast. Retail workers and suppliers, who have played a vital role throughout this pandemic, should be allowed to work provided they are double vaccinated or can show a negative Covid test, to ensure there is no disruption to the public's ability to get food and other goods,"" he said. The boss of Iceland supermarkets and leaders at pub chain Greene King have also called for new rulesto avoid crippling shutdowns. Croatia wants tourists to return, but has imposed mandatory testing rules for some Croatia has been on the UK's green list of countries for travel - the lowest level of restriction - since Monday. You can read about the rules for green, amber and red list countrieshere Croatia however has changed the rules for arrivals from the UK, as well as those from Cyprus and Russia. As of Monday 26 July, all visitors from these countries will need proof of a negative Covid test - regardless of whether they've been vaccinated or have proof of recovery from the virus. Tourism accounts for about 20% of the country's economy. But cases have been rising there over the last 10 days, particularly in areas along the Adriatic Coast. On Wednesday, authorities reported 191 new infections in Croatia. Sir Keir Starmer's self-isolation means four of the country's most senior politicians are now quarantining at home. Last week, Health Secretary Sajid Javid tested positive after feeling unwell, leading Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Chancellor Rishi Sunak to isolate at Chequers - the PM's house in Buckinghamshire -  and Downing Street respectively. It has been reported this week that Javid's positive test has forced a raft of senior No 10 and health department officials to self-isolate. It was initially announced that Johnson and Sunak would avoid having to self-isolate through a pilot daily testing programme, but this decisionwas reversed less than three hours later on Sunday. We know Sir Keir was in the Commons earlier for PMQs so it raises the question: if he goes on to develop Covid, how many other politicians will need to self-isolate? As it is announced Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer is to begin self-isolation after one of his children tested positive for Covid (seeearlier posts), let's re-cap the rules he will need to observe. While many restrictions on daily life have now lifted in England, stay-at-home orders for those in close contact with confirmed coronavirus cases have remained in place. Currently, you must self-isolate for 10 days if you test positive, live with someone who tests positive, are told to isolate by NHS Test and Trace, or someone you live with has symptoms. Some fully vaccinated critical workers in England - including health and care staff - will be able to leave isolation to go to work, even if they are traced as a contact of someone with Covid. But these people are specifically named on a letter from a government department in advance of any potential self-isolation order. Changes to the rules around self-isolation for people who are fully vaccinated are due to begin from 16 August in England. Read more about the current ruleshere. The BBC Proms will go ahead at full capacity this year, with audience members ""strongly encouraged"" to wear masks. They will also be required to provide a negative lateral flow test, a positive PCR test or proof of double vaccination. Promming tickets, where audience members can stand in the arena or gallery areas of the Royal Albert Hall, will also be available on the day of each concert. The 2020 edition featured a reduced orchestra playing to an empty auditorium - with the singers placed in the stalls. The return of the fully-fledged event will feature52 concerts over 44 days featuring 30 orchestras and ensembles, more than 100 soloists and conductors and more than 2,000 musicians. The BBC says: ""The safety of our audiences is our main priority and we are taking every step we can to open the Proms safely without social distancing."" Audience members over the age of 18 will be asked to provide a negative lateral flow test taken within 48 hours of the performance, or evidence of double vaccination provided via the NHS app or a letter provided by the NHS. They can also offer proof of natural immunity based upon a positive PCR test taken within 180 days of the performance. Under 18s will be asked for verbal confirmation from a parent or guardian that they have not received a positive test. The BBC Proms opens on 30 July and runs until 11 September. The news that Sir Keir Starmer has begun self-isolation comes just hours after he described a ""summer of chaos"" amid soaring numbers of people self-isolating at home. Starmer dubbed PM Boris Johnson - who is himself self-isolating in Buckinghamshire - the ""Chequers one"" as he mocked Johnson's isolation on the same week most remaining curbs lifted in England. Speaking in the Commons, Starmer said: ""Everything may be calm from the prime minister's country retreat but back here the truth is we're heading for a summer of chaos."" It is the fourth time Labour leader has self-isolated after coming in close contact with a confirmed Covid case since the pandemic began. Starmer isolated inJanuary,December and September last year after being notified that an associate had tested positive. Given his child's positive test came at lunchtime, Starmer may have to self-isolate until 31 July - potentially throwing into doubt any plans his family might have made for a summer holiday. The House of Commons goes into recess tomorrow. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer is to self-isolate after one of his children tested positive, a spokesman says. ""One of Keir's children tested positive for Covid this lunchtime. In line with the rules, Keir and his family will now be self-isolating,"" they said. ""Keir was already doing daily tests and tested negative this morning. He will continue to take daily tests."" Earlier we told you of some of the big name businesses forced to close or reduce services because of the ""pingdemic"". But it's not just household names affected - smaller businesses have told of the disruption caused when staff have to self-isolate. Mrs Salisbury's Tea Rooms in Maldon, Essex is closed until Saturday as co-owner Mike Bloomfield and five staff - half the workforce - are self-isolating after being in contact with a positive Covid case. He says: ""Luckily everybody is negative [for Covid-19] and doing fine at the moment but we still have to do what we have to do and isolate."" Sean Hughes Sean Hughes, who owns pubs in St Albans, says he has been forced to close The Boot due to one member of staff being contacted by NHS Test and Trace and others being pinged by the app. ""We have reduced hours and closed the kitchen for most of this week until they can come back. ""All tests thus far showing negative on a daily basis. It is a complete mess."" You can read more reaction from businesses ownershere.

"Liverpool's World Heritage status recognised the architectural landmarks on the waterfront Liverpool has been stripped of its World Heritage status after a UN committee found developments threatened the value of the city's waterfront. The decision was made following a secret ballot by the Unesco committee at a meeting in China. Unesco had said that the developments, including the planned new Everton FC stadium, had resulted in a ""serious deterioration"" of the historic site. The decision was described as ""incomprehensible"" by the city's mayor. ""Our World Heritage site has never been in better condition having benefitted from hundreds of millions of pounds of investment across dozens of listed buildings and the public realm,"" Joanne Anderson said. She said she would work with the government to examine whether the city could appeal against the decision, which comes ""a decade after Unesco last visited the city to see it with their own eyes"". This video can not be played The decision was made at a UN meeting in China Liverpool City Region Mayor Steve Rotheram said the decision was ""a retrograde step that does not reflect the reality of what is happening on the ground"". ""Places like Liverpool should not be faced with the binary choice between maintaining heritage status or regenerating left-behind communities and the wealth of jobs and opportunities that come with it,"" he said. Labour's Kim Johnson, MP for Liverpool Riverside, said she remained ""proud of my city and what we've done"". ""People come here because it's amazing city and, while I'm disappointed, as a city we are resilient and we will always fight back."" An artist's impression of Everton's new stadium, which is being built at Bramley Moore Dock The government said it was ""extremely disappointed"" and believes Liverpool still deserves its heritage status ""given the significant role the historic docks and the wider city have played throughout history"". Liverpool becomes only the third site to lose its World Heritage status since the list began in 1978, the other two being Oman's Arabian Oryx Sanctuary in 2007 and the Dresden Elbe Valley in Germany in 2009. Proposal to remove World Heritage status 'painful' Australia angered by Great Barrier Reef report Everton cleared to build new Â£500m stadium Announcing the decision, the committee chairman said 20 votes had been cast - with 13 in favour of deleting the city, five against the proposal and two ballot papers being invalid. Liverpool's Liberal Democrat leader Richard Kempsaid it was a ""day of shame"" for the city,,externaladding that it would ""without a doubt, affect our tourism and inward investment"". This video can not be played City's heritage status loss ""a real shame"" The city was awarded the much-coveted title in 2004 in recognition of its historical and architectural impact, joining places including the Taj Mahal, Egypt's Pyramids and Canterbury Cathedral. It recognised its history as a major trading centre during the British Empire and its architectural landmarks. However, a report in June by the World Heritage Committee said developments on the city's waterfront had resulted in ""irreversible loss of attributes"". It cited theLiverpool Waters projectandEverton's new stadium, which is being built at Bramley Moore Dock. Chris Capes, director of development for Peel L&P's Liverpool Waters, said he was disappointed ""particularly given the considerable investment that the city has put into protecting and improving its heritage sites"". Everton have agreed to invest up to Â£55m to ""preserve, restore and celebrate the heritage assets"" of the area as part of its stadium plan. They project was approved following two public consultations, with the second survey attracting more than 40,000 people. The club found 98% of people supported the proposed design of the stadium, while 96% backed the club's plans for historic features on the site. By Claire Hamilton, BBC Radio Merseyside political reporter Liverpool has seen more peaks and troughs than most, and it's a city which has changed immeasurably since 2004 when the World Heritage Status was conferred. Back then, there was no Liverpool One shopping centre, no hint that Everton would consider building a multi-million pound waterfront stadium and its year as European Capital of Culture hadn't happened. The city has changed. Today, there's a sense of defiance in some quarters about Unesco's decision that the city doesn't need the title, especially if sits in the way of progress for an area which has lain neglected and semi derelict for decades. Critics argue the benefits of being a World Heritage status were never properly spelled out and there wasn't the political will in the city to address Unesco's concerns until recently, when it was too late. Many people argue that tourists visiting the Pier Head, St George's Plateau or Penny Lane are not coming because Liverpool is a designated World Heritage site - they probably don't even realise it is. They're coming for the Beatles, the football, food and the history but that history will remain. Yet today's announcement worries those who fear that the ability to protect heritage, architecture and history is now diminished, that there will be a free-for-all of unsuitable, careless development. The argument for the last decade has been presented as a binary choice: heritage or progress? The feeling in Liverpool is, couldn't we have had both? Dr David Jeffery hopes the decision will act as a warning to the council Dr David Jeffery, who is a lecturer of British politics at the University of Liverpool, said he believed the decision would not have a ""serious impact"" on the city's tourism industry. ""I do hope this serves as a warning to the council to stop approving ugly buildings though,"" he said. Wayne Colquhoun, who has campaigned for 15 years to keep Liverpool's heritage status, said he was ""devastated"" by the news. ""It's the status symbol that has put us up there with the Great Wall of China and the pyramids and now it has gone,"" he said. ""You've got to be clever being a World Heritage city and be able to take traditional materials and build them in a modern manner."" Wayne Colquhoun said the decision would ""stop people thinking that we are up there with the greatest cities on Earth"" Richie Wright, 40, who has lived in Liverpool all his life, said the status had ""on many occasions, hampered and restricted development in a city that is ripe for development"". ""I hope that Liverpool and its wider city region now seizes this opportunity to make common sense decisions that make our city and the world proud,"" he said.

"This video can not be played England heatwave: Huge hailstones fall during thunderstorm Hail the size of golf balls fell in a thunderstorm damaging cars and smashing windows as extreme heat warnings stayed in place across England. The hail storm hit Kibworth Beauchamp village in Leicestershire at about 18:15 BST on Tuesday. Resident Katie Jaffar said the storm was ""terrifying"" and left her car ""covered in golf ball-sized dents"". Several roads in the East of England also flooded as temperatures of 30C (85F) turned to heavy rain and hail. The Met Office had earlier issued ayellow warning for thunderstorms,external. The giant hail put an end to a day of fun in the sun for many as they counted the cost of the damage Journalist and mother-of-two Mrs Jaffar, 46, said: ""One minute the kids were playing with their friends in the paddling pool and it was gloriously hot. ""The next minute huge dollops of rain started falling and then it turned into hail - giant lumps of it thundering down. ""It was so fast, it was pretty terrifying."" Latest news and stories from the East Midlands Kibworth Court care home had to move all residents to the first floor after two lounges, the dining room and reception flooded. Manager Caroline Harrison said: ""We were watching it with the residents because it was massive hailstones, and we realised it was actually getting really close to the front door, and then all of a sudden it just [came] straight through all the windows. ""We had to get the residents upstairs [and] phoned the fire brigade, because by then we were under at least eight inches of water. ""They came out and pumped the car park - the car park was like a massive pond."" One resident estimated the size of the hail to be three to five centimetres Ms Harrison said staff had worked through the night to clean up and were ""all pretty exhausted"" and ""grateful"" to villagers who dropped off towels and helped after an appeal on Facebook. ""Most of the staff came in to help us have a massive clean-up last night - we've been here all night,"" she added. ""We've lost all the carpet - it's not something I want to go through again. ""The back garden is absolutely devastated. The gazebos all have holes in them, the umbrellas have gone. ""The devastation's pretty gutting."" A number of people compared the hailstones to items in their homes By Anna Church, BBC East Midlands Today senior weather presenter Although hail is not unusual in the summer, the size of it experienced in Kibworth and surrounding areas on Tuesday is uncommon. It formed due to a number of factors. The atmosphere was highly unstable across the region yesterday, which led to strong updrafts in the cloud, allowing the hail longer to form and therefore get bigger. The instability was also deep, with a large area of cloud above freezing. The hail accompanied thunderstorms, which also caused flash flooding in places. A number of cars took damage during the storm Kevin Messenger's car window was taken out Several Twitter users posted videos of the torrential showers, pictures of the giant hail and smashed car windows. One Kibworth resident, who did not want to be named, said every car in the village would have been damaged if it was not in a garage or under cover. ""They were huge boulders coming from the sky, it was unbelievable,"" she said. ""I know a lot of people that have had their cars damaged. My car and partner's van were hit, my mother-in-law's greenhouse and window sill on the conservatory have boulder-sized holes in them. ""It felt like it lasted over an hour and a half, it was freaky."" A greenhouse was hit during the storm Kevin Messenger saw his car damaged by the storm. ""It was a surreal experience to be honest,"" he told BBC Radio Leicester. ""One minute you are basking in the glorious sunshine, and then a little bit of rain started and all of a sudden the noise started echoing around the house.

"This video can not be played England heatwave: Huge hailstones fall during thunderstorm Hail the size of golf balls fell in a thunderstorm damaging cars and smashing windows as extreme heat warnings stayed in place across England. The hail storm hit Kibworth Beauchamp village in Leicestershire at about 18:15 BST on Tuesday. Resident Katie Jaffar said the storm was ""terrifying"" and left her car ""covered in golf ball-sized dents"". Several roads in the East of England also flooded as temperatures of 30C (85F) turned to heavy rain and hail. The Met Office had earlier issued ayellow warning for thunderstorms,external. The giant hail put an end to a day of fun in the sun for many as they counted the cost of the damage Journalist and mother-of-two Mrs Jaffar, 46, said: ""One minute the kids were playing with their friends in the paddling pool and it was gloriously hot. ""The next minute huge dollops of rain started falling and then it turned into hail - giant lumps of it thundering down. ""It was so fast, it was pretty terrifying."" Latest news and stories from the East Midlands Kibworth Court care home had to move all residents to the first floor after two lounges, the dining room and reception flooded. Manager Caroline Harrison said: ""We were watching it with the residents because it was massive hailstones, and we realised it was actually getting really close to the front door, and then all of a sudden it just [came] straight through all the windows. ""We had to get the residents upstairs [and] phoned the fire brigade, because by then we were under at least eight inches of water. ""They came out and pumped the car park - the car park was like a massive pond."" One resident estimated the size of the hail to be three to five centimetres Ms Harrison said staff had worked through the night to clean up and were ""all pretty exhausted"" and ""grateful"" to villagers who dropped off towels and helped after an appeal on Facebook. ""Most of the staff came in to help us have a massive clean-up last night - we've been here all night,"" she added. ""We've lost all the carpet - it's not something I want to go through again. ""The back garden is absolutely devastated. The gazebos all have holes in them, the umbrellas have gone. ""The devastation's pretty gutting."" A number of people compared the hailstones to items in their homes By Anna Church, BBC East Midlands Today senior weather presenter Although hail is not unusual in the summer, the size of it experienced in Kibworth and surrounding areas on Tuesday is uncommon. It formed due to a number of factors. The atmosphere was highly unstable across the region yesterday, which led to strong updrafts in the cloud, allowing the hail longer to form and therefore get bigger. The instability was also deep, with a large area of cloud above freezing. The hail accompanied thunderstorms, which also caused flash flooding in places. A number of cars took damage during the storm Kevin Messenger's car window was taken out Several Twitter users posted videos of the torrential showers, pictures of the giant hail and smashed car windows. One Kibworth resident, who did not want to be named, said every car in the village would have been damaged if it was not in a garage or under cover. ""They were huge boulders coming from the sky, it was unbelievable,"" she said. ""I know a lot of people that have had their cars damaged. My car and partner's van were hit, my mother-in-law's greenhouse and window sill on the conservatory have boulder-sized holes in them. ""It felt like it lasted over an hour and a half, it was freaky."" A greenhouse was hit during the storm Kevin Messenger saw his car damaged by the storm. ""It was a surreal experience to be honest,"" he told BBC Radio Leicester. ""One minute you are basking in the glorious sunshine, and then a little bit of rain started and all of a sudden the noise started echoing around the house. ""I woke up this morning almost feeling a bit fortunate and a bit grateful - [there are] definitely worse-impacted people than me.""

"Liverpool's World Heritage status recognised the architectural landmarks on the waterfront Liverpool has been stripped of its World Heritage status after a UN committee found developments threatened the value of the city's waterfront. The decision was made following a secret ballot by the Unesco committee at a meeting in China. Unesco had said that the developments, including the planned new Everton FC stadium, had resulted in a ""serious deterioration"" of the historic site. The decision was described as ""incomprehensible"" by the city's mayor. ""Our World Heritage site has never been in better condition having benefitted from hundreds of millions of pounds of investment across dozens of listed buildings and the public realm,"" Joanne Anderson said. She said she would work with the government to examine whether the city could appeal against the decision, which comes ""a decade after Unesco last visited the city to see it with their own eyes"". This video can not be played The decision was made at a UN meeting in China Liverpool City Region Mayor Steve Rotheram said the decision was ""a retrograde step that does not reflect the reality of what is happening on the ground"". ""Places like Liverpool should not be faced with the binary choice between maintaining heritage status or regenerating left-behind communities and the wealth of jobs and opportunities that come with it,"" he said. Labour's Kim Johnson, MP for Liverpool Riverside, said she remained ""proud of my city and what we've done"". ""People come here because it's amazing city and, while I'm disappointed, as a city we are resilient and we will always fight back."" An artist's impression of Everton's new stadium, which is being built at Bramley Moore Dock The government said it was ""extremely disappointed"" and believes Liverpool still deserves its heritage status ""given the significant role the historic docks and the wider city have played throughout history"". Liverpool becomes only the third site to lose its World Heritage status since the list began in 1978, the other two being Oman's Arabian Oryx Sanctuary in 2007 and the Dresden Elbe Valley in Germany in 2009. Proposal to remove World Heritage status 'painful' Australia angered by Great Barrier Reef report Everton cleared to build new Â£500m stadium Announcing the decision, the committee chairman said 20 votes had been cast - with 13 in favour of deleting the city, five against the proposal and two ballot papers being invalid. Liverpool's Liberal Democrat leader Richard Kempsaid it was a ""day of shame"" for the city,,externaladding that it would ""without a doubt, affect our tourism and inward investment"". This video can not be played City's heritage status loss ""a real shame"" The city was awarded the much-coveted title in 2004 in recognition of its historical and architectural impact, joining places including the Taj Mahal, Egypt's Pyramids and Canterbury Cathedral. It recognised its history as a major trading centre during the British Empire and its architectural landmarks. However, a report in June by the World Heritage Committee said developments on the city's waterfront had resulted in ""irreversible loss of attributes"". It cited theLiverpool Waters projectandEverton's new stadium, which is being built at Bramley Moore Dock. Chris Capes, director of development for Peel L&P's Liverpool Waters, said he was disappointed ""particularly given the considerable investment that the city has put into protecting and improving its heritage sites"". Everton have agreed to invest up to Â£55m to ""preserve, restore and celebrate the heritage assets"" of the area as part of its stadium plan. They project was approved following two public consultations, with the second survey attracting more than 40,000 people. The club found 98% of people supported the proposed design of the stadium, while 96% backed the club's plans for historic features on the site. By Claire Hamilton, BBC Radio Merseyside political reporter Liverpool has seen more peaks and troughs than most, and it's a city which has changed immeasurably since 2004 when the World Heritage Status was conferred. Back then, there was no Liverpool One shopping centre, no hint that Everton would consider building a multi-million pound waterfront stadium and its year as European Capital of Culture hadn't happened. The city has changed. Today, there's a sense of defiance in some quarters about Unesco's decision that the city doesn't need the title, especially if sits in the way of progress for an area which has lain neglected and semi derelict for decades. Critics argue the benefits of being a World Heritage status were never properly spelled out and there wasn't the political will in the city to address Unesco's concerns until recently, when it was too late. Many people argue that tourists visiting the Pier Head, St George's Plateau or Penny Lane are not coming because Liverpool is a designated World Heritage site - they probably don't even realise it is. They're coming for the Beatles, the football, food and the history but that history will remain. Yet today's announcement worries those who fear that the ability to protect heritage, architecture and history is now diminished, that there will be a free-for-all of unsuitable, careless development. The argument for the last decade has been presented as a binary choice: heritage or progress? The feeling in Liverpool is, couldn't we have had both? Dr David Jeffery hopes the decision will act as a warning to the council Dr David Jeffery, who is a lecturer of British politics at the University of Liverpool, said he believed the decision would not have a ""serious impact"" on the city's tourism industry. ""I do hope this serves as a warning to the council to stop approving ugly buildings though,"" he said. Wayne Colquhoun, who has campaigned for 15 years to keep Liverpool's heritage status, said he was ""devastated"" by the news. ""It's the status symbol that has put us up there with the Great Wall of China and the pyramids and now it has gone,"" he said. ""You've got to be clever being a World Heritage city and be able to take traditional materials and build them in a modern manner."" Wayne Colquhoun said the decision would ""stop people thinking that we are up there with the greatest cities on Earth"" Richie Wright, 40, who has lived in Liverpool all his life, said the status had ""on many occasions, hampered and restricted development in a city that is ripe for development"". ""I hope that Liverpool and its wider city region now seizes this opportunity to make common sense decisions that make our city and the world proud,"" he said.

"Industry bodies have reacted with dismay at the government's plan for firms to apply for staff to be exempt from coronavirus self-isolation rules. The government has said there will be no list of critical workers exempt from isolating rules and exemptions will be ""considered on a case-by-case basis"". Karen Dee, chief executive of the airport operators association, said the scheme was ""simply unworkable"". The food supply industry called for clarity on how the scheme would work. The new policy comes after Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced on Monday that fully-vaccinated people in critical roles in England would be able to continue workingeven if told to self-isolate after being in close contact with someone who has Covid.The new rule is limited to those without Covid symptoms. Individual businesses will have to contact their relevant government department to apply for any exemption. Those deemed eligible, which includes NHS and care staff, will be able to take daily tests instead. Downing Street said that the first exemptions around self-isolation have been given in some critical sectors. The number of exceptions outside of the NHS is expected to be relatively small, and not reach the high tens of thousands. There are ongoing discussions with companies in critical industries. The prime minister's official spokesman said: ""A number of those exemptions are in process of being granted or have been granted."" 'Pingdemic' Firms have warned of increasing staff shortages caused by people being forced to self-isolate by the NHS Covid app.Iceland and Greene King saidon Monday they had had to shut shops and pubs as a result. Business lobby group the CBI has warned that the problem could hamper the economic recovery. Rod McKenzie, of the Road Haulage Association, said the plan felt like it had been ""thought up on the hoof without proper organisation or thought"". ""Truckers were classed as essential workers at the start of the pandemic; now they may be or may not be,"" he said. ""It's too confusing. The criteria isn't clear and it risks being both unfair and devastating to an already creaking supply chain."" Ms Dee, of the airport operators association, said the government ""must reconsider and exempt categories of workers"", such as airport security staff  and air traffic controllers from the requirement to self-isolate. ""As 24-hour operations, we need clear rules that are workable and easy to implement or there is a risk of unnecessary temporary closures,"" she said. ""Applying for each individual for an exemption from self-quarantine if they are 'pinged' is simply unworkable."" 'Pingdemic' shuts Iceland and Greene King sites Shane Brennan, chief executive of the Cold Chain Federation, said: ""What is the application process for businesses to use this? Who will qualify? Do you have to prove you are severely affected? How long will it take? ""If it's not simple and quick, it will not help and most businesses will have to ignore it. He said the number of people absent in the food sector due to isolation requests was ""growing exponentially across the food supply chain"". Andrew Selley is the chief executive of food wholesaler Bidfood, which has about 5,000 employees across the UK and 24 depots. He said the number of staff who were self-isolating changed on a day-to-day basis, but added the company had ""well over 100 people"" off at the moment. The firm, which has large contracts with schools, hospitals and prisons, recently had half a shift off at one depot due to staff being told to isolate. Mr Selley said it was a ""little ridiculous"" to expect individual companies to seek exemptions for staff who had been told to self-isolate. He added entire sectors, such as food supply, should be exempted and the government's scheme should work in the ""same way it did for key workers"" at the beginning of the pandemic. The government has saidit is ""crucial"" for people to quarantine after being ""pinged""by the NHS Covid-19 app. Its message comes after business minister Paul Scully said it was a decision for individuals and employers whether they should isolate after a ""ping"" from the app. The Times reported that another minister in the business department, Lord Grimstone of Boscobel, stressed in a letter to one large employer that the app was only an ""advisory tool"" and that people were not under any ""legal duty"". The prime minister's official spokesman said ""business-critical areas"" would be able to apply to be exempt from isolating. ""It's not a blanket exemption and my understanding is we're not going to be producing a list covering individual sectors,"" he said. ""It's important that anyone who feels they're in a critical industry or wants to raise potential issues because of isolation are able to contact departments and get advice and where necessary get exemptions."" Asked specifically about supermarket workers, the spokesman said: ""We're not seeking to draw lines specifically around who or who is not exempt. ""What's important is to make sure critical services are able to function and get that balance right between requiring people to isolate... but also making sure critical services can function.""

"The protocol means some goods from Great Britain are now subjected to checks at Northern Ireland's ports Northern Ireland's political parties are divided on calls by the government for the EU to begin negotiations to radically amend the Brexit protocol. On Wednesday, Number 10 gave details of some proposals and said a new arrangement was urgently needed. Unionist parties, which oppose the protocol, have welcomed the statement and urged the EU to engage. But Sinn FÃ©in, the SDLP and Alliance urged the government to agree a veterinary agreement to reduce checks. The UK and EU agreed the Northern Ireland Protocol in 2019, as part of the Brexit withdrawal agreement. It prevents a hard border in Ireland by keeping Northern Ireland in the EU single market for goods. The UK says its implementation has been ""unbalanced"" and is ""unsustainable"" in its current form. Brexit Minister Lord Frost said the full deal should not be implemented andcalled on the EU to look at new proposals with ""fresh eyes"". His comments were welcomed by unionist parties in Northern Ireland, who have called for the protocol to be renegotiated as it is damaging Great Britain to Northern Ireland (GB-NI) trade and posing a risk to the union in its current form. What is the Northern Ireland Protocol? Supermarkets warn of rising costs over NI Protocol Government to publish NI Protocol plans in July Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said there was now a ""tacit acceptance"" from the government that the protocol is not working. ""Sticking plasters and short-term fixes were never going to work. We need a proper renegotiation,"" he said. He criticised the EU and said Brussels had ""failed to recognise the concerns of unionists"". DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson wants the Northern Ireland Protocol renegotiated The government has issued a 28 page command paper to accompany today's ministerial statements. But it boils down to one simple sentiment: ""Trust us."" They are telling the EU that it's single market can be protected without the panoply of checks and controls which currently apply to goods entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain. They are suggesting this can largely be achieved through a light-touch, trusted trader scheme and new legislation to discourage smuggling. Brexit veterans will recognise these as the sort of ""alternative arrangements"" suggested earlier in this process. The EU was not persuaded then and with trust in short supply it will be a struggle to persuade them now. The Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader Doug Beattie said he hoped Wednesday's statement would lead to ""movement in the direction of finding pragmatic, workable solutions"". ""I hope that the European Union will take their time in considering these proposals in good faith and will not reject them out of hand,"" he added. The UUP leader will travel to Dublin on Thursday to meet the Taoiseach (Irish PM) MicheÃ¡l Martin to make that case to him directly. Stormont's other main parties - Sinn FÃ©in, the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) and Alliance - have said they recognise concerns about the protocol but that must be fully implemented in the absence of another arrangement. Sinn FÃ©in chairman Declan Kearney said the British government had agreed and ratified all elements of the protocol with the European Commission. ""It should now stop the evasion, and get on with it's implementation,"" he said. ""It is not acceptable for the Tories to adopt an a la carte approach towards the protocol, to rewrite history, and now attempt a renegotiation."" SDLP leader Colum Eastwood described the government's statement on Wednesday as a ""shameless position based on political expedience rather than providing the stability that people, businesses and communities in Northern Ireland need"". He said he believed a resolution was still possible but would require the government to ""step back from its bad faith interventions"". Colum Eastwood described the UK government's approach to the protocol as a ""shameless position"" Alliance's deputy leader Stephen Farry also said the government was attempting to ""rewrite history"" and that their actions had undermined trust with the EU in finding sustainable solutions. His party has supported suggestions from the EU for a temporary Swiss-style veterinary agreement as a way to reduce most checks on goods coming into Northern Ireland from Great Britain. That would require the UK to follow all EU agri-food rules. The UK said it is unwilling to cede control to the EU on this issue and is instead pushing for an equivalence arrangement in which the EU would recognise UK food production standards as being equivalent to its own. Simon Hoare, chairman of Westminster's Northern Ireland Affairs Committee, described the UK's new proposals for the protocol as an ""interesting approach"". ""If there is to be any chance of change, mutual and binding trust will be the key currency. I am fearful that this is in short supply and needs to be worked on energetically and now. ""Common sense and pragmatism must not be a dirty word for either side,"" Mr Hoare added. Earlier, Ireland's Europe minister, Thomas Byrne, said ""there can be no renegotiation of the [NI] protocol"". But he added that the arrangement had its complications, and said Irish government is ""willing to discuss any creative solutions within the confines of the protocol"". The EU has strict rules about the importation of chilled meat products like mince and sausages Ahead of the publication of the UK paper, thechairman of Marks & Spencer Archie Norman warned of the impact of full protocol checkson fresh foods when grace periods end this autumn. ""This Christmas, I can tell you already, we're having to make decisions to delist product for Northern Ireland because it's simply not worth the risk of trying to get it through,"" he said. Mr Norman called for a ""common sense"" solution to post-Brexit problems at his firm's stores on the island of Ireland. The M&S said the level of checks and controls are ""very threatening"" to Marks and Spencer's Irish business. He suggests the easiest solution would be to ""agree a time limited veterinary/food standards agreement"". Speaking on Radio 4 on Wednesday morning, Mr Norman said the problems his company has faced exporting to the Republic of Ireland are likely to be replicated in Northern Ireland by the autumn. ""At the moment only about 80% of our product is getting into [the Republic of] Ireland - so 20% doesn't arrive at all,"" he said. ""It's not the rules of the Customs Union that is the problem, it's the Byzantine and pointless and honestly pettifogging enforcement which means that wagons can't get through."" He said trucks had been turned away on the basis of the wrong colour of typeface used on documents. ""We're employing 13 full-time vets who are not looking after animals or welfare, they're simply ticking boxes and filling out forms,"" he added. ""Sandwiches typically require about three vets' certificates to get through. ""Come October our experience in southern Ireland is probably, as it currently stands, set to be replicated in Northern Ireland.""

Let's re-cap what happened in the UK: France has introduced a new health pass for some venues and public spaces The Delta variant spreads, France rolls out its Covid health

from around the world: Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Authorities in Nanjing announced city-wide testing on Wednesday Part of a
major Chinese city has today gone into lockdown, after 17 airport workers
tested positive. According to
Chinaâs officialXinhua News Agency,external, employees at Nanjingâs Lukou International
Airport have tested positive. Nine of those are symptomatic. Flights have
subsequently been cancelled and 500 people have been placed under medical
observation. The local government today announced a citywide testing drive,
which will cover 9.3 million people. Four communities and villages in the city
have now become âmedium riskâ, meaning that local lockdown measures are in
place. Nanjing, in
eastern Jiangsu, is now one of two Chinese cities where there are lockdown
measures in place. There has been an outbreak since early July at the opposite
end of the country in a city called Ruili, which borders Myanmar. There are more
than 200 people currently in hospital in Yunnan province, many in the city of
Ruili. Today, a new testing drive has also been ordered there. Residents in
Ruili have already experienced multiple testing drives throughout the pandemic,
as the city has experienced four waves of the coronavirus. It has a population
of some 270,000 people. This video can not be played Inside India's deadly mucormycosis fungus epidemic Mucormycosis, a rare and deadly infection known as ""black fungus"", has killed more than 4,300 people in India, the health ministry has reported. The country has recorded 45,374 cases of the illness. Doctors say the fungus has a link with the steroids used to treat Covid, and diabetics are at particular risk. But the scale of the problem could be even greater. Dr Raghuraj Hegde, a Bangalore-based eye surgeon who has treated a number of mucormycosis patients, told the BBC that there had been ""massive undercounting of both cases and deaths"" from the disease. ""Typically, deaths in mucormycosis occur weeks to months after getting the disease. Our present systems are not good to capture that data,"" he said. You can read more about ithere Uptake of the coronavirus vaccine has been lower among ethnic minorities in Scotland, with African groups having the lowest levels of inoculation, the latest data shows. Rates are also lower among Asian Scots and those of Black or Caribbean heritage, figures from Public Health Scotland show. Other studies have found similarly lower levels of vaccination among ethnic minorities elsewhere in the UK. In Scotland, the difference has been most apparent in the 70 to 74 age range, where first dose uptake is 97.2% for the white ethnic group and 73.7% for the African ethnic group. For the Asian group in this age range, uptake was at 89.7% while the figure for Black or Caribbean Scots was 93.8%. While uptake was high in all age ranges among white Scots, it varied considerably among Black or Caribbean Scots, with uptake ranging from 96.0% in the over 80s to 46.0% in those aged 18-29 years. A further 44,104 people have tested positive for the coronavirus across the UK,government figures,externalshow. Another 73 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were also reported.  Over 39,000 people died of coronavirus in care home settings in England between 10 April 2020 and 31 March this year. Amanda Henry had been unable to see her father Robert, 78, for nearly four weeks - and when she was at last allowed into his care home in Poplar, east London, it was because he was gravely ill. Care homes were struggling to get personal protective equipment and the official guidance they needed. At the time Amanda just wanted to give him some comfort, but even then - in April 2020 - she says she noticed shortcomings with personal protective equipment (PPE). There was not enough of it, it was flimsy, and staff were not using it properly, she claims. Staff were going from room to room, not changing their PPE, not washing their hands between rooms, and some had no PPE at all, she says. ""What I was witnessing was the virus being spread amongst the residents of the care home in real time... ""I feel it tells us that these vulnerable elderly people were disposable to this government... ""I'm angry, I'm angry that my dad had to suffer like that."" Read morehere. More than 39,000 people died of coronavirus in care homes in England in the year from 10 April 2020 to 31 March 2021, new figures suggest. The numbers, released by the Care Quality Commission (CQC), show how the virus spread across the country. The highest number of deaths in a single care home was 44, while 21 homes had more than 30 Covid-related deaths. ""Every number represents a life lost,"" said Kate Terroni, CQC chief inspector for adult social care. Read morehere. The British Retail Consortium (BRC) has urged the government to ensure staff in stores and suppliers should be allowed to work even if they get an alert to self-isolate. The BRC's Andrew Opie said the ""pingdemic"" meant retailers were finding it difficult to maintain opening hours and keep shelves stocked. ""Government needs to act fast. Retail workers and suppliers, who have played a vital role throughout this pandemic, should be allowed to work provided they are double vaccinated or can show a negative Covid test, to ensure there is no disruption to the public's ability to get food and other goods,"" he said. The boss of Iceland supermarkets and leaders at pub chain Greene King have also called for new rulesto avoid crippling shutdowns. Croatia wants tourists to return, but has imposed mandatory testing rules for some Croatia has been on the UK's green list of countries for travel - the lowest level of restriction - since Monday. You can read about the rules for green, amber and red list countrieshere Croatia however has changed the rules for arrivals from the UK, as well as those from Cyprus and Russia. As of Monday 26 July, all visitors from these countries will need proof of a negative Covid test - regardless of whether they've been vaccinated or have proof of recovery from the virus. Tourism accounts for about 20% of the country's economy. But cases have been rising there over the last 10 days, particularly in areas along the Adriatic Coast. On Wednesday, authorities reported 191 new infections in Croatia. Sir Keir Starmer's self-isolation means four of the country's most senior politicians are now quarantining at home. Last week, Health Secretary Sajid Javid tested positive after feeling unwell, leading Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Chancellor Rishi Sunak to isolate at Chequers - the PM's house in Buckinghamshire -  and Downing Street respectively. It has been reported this week that Javid's positive test has forced a raft of senior No 10 and health department officials to self-isolate. It was initially announced that Johnson and Sunak would avoid having to self-isolate through a pilot daily testing programme, but this decisionwas reversed less than three hours later on Sunday. We know Sir Keir was in the Commons earlier for PMQs so it raises the question: if he goes on to develop Covid, how many other politicians will need to self-isolate? As it is announced Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer is to begin self-isolation after one of his children tested positive for Covid (seeearlier posts), let's re-cap the rules he will need to observe. While many restrictions on daily life have now lifted in England, stay-at-home orders for those in close contact with confirmed coronavirus cases have remained in place. Currently, you must self-isolate for 10 days if you test positive, live with someone who tests positive, are told to isolate by NHS Test and Trace, or someone you live with has symptoms. Some fully vaccinated critical workers in England - including health and care staff - will be able to leave isolation to go to work, even if they are traced as a contact of someone with Covid. But these people are specifically named on a letter from a government department in advance of any potential self-isolation order. Changes to the rules around self-isolation for people who are fully vaccinated are due to begin from 16 August in England. Read more about the current ruleshere. The BBC Proms will go ahead at full capacity this year, with audience members ""strongly encouraged"" to wear masks. They will also be required to provide a negative lateral flow test, a positive PCR test or proof of double vaccination. Promming tickets, where audience members can stand in the arena or gallery areas of the Royal Albert Hall, will also be available on the day of each concert. The 2020 edition featured a reduced orchestra playing to an empty auditorium - with the singers placed in the stalls. The return of the fully-fledged event will feature52 concerts over 44 days featuring 30 orchestras and ensembles, more than 100 soloists and conductors and more than 2,000 musicians. The BBC says: ""The safety of our audiences is our main priority and we are taking every step we can to open the Proms safely without social distancing."" Audience members over the age of 18 will be asked to provide a negative lateral flow test taken within 48 hours of the performance, or evidence of double vaccination provided via the NHS app or a letter provided by the NHS. They can also offer proof of natural immunity based upon a positive PCR test taken within 180 days of the performance. Under 18s will be asked for verbal confirmation from a parent or guardian that they have not received a positive test. The BBC Proms opens on 30 July and runs until 11 September. The news that Sir Keir Starmer has begun self-isolation comes just hours after he described a ""summer of chaos"" amid soaring numbers of people self-isolating at home. Starmer dubbed PM Boris Johnson - who is himself self-isolating in Buckinghamshire - the ""Chequers one"" as he mocked Johnson's isolation on the same week most remaining curbs lifted in England. Speaking in the Commons, Starmer said: ""Everything may be calm from the prime minister's country retreat but back here the truth is we're heading for a summer of chaos."" It is the fourth time Labour leader has self-isolated after coming in close contact with a confirmed Covid case since the pandemic began. Starmer isolated inJanuary,December and September last year after being notified that an associate had tested positive. Given his child's positive test came at lunchtime, Starmer may have to self-isolate until 31 July - potentially throwing into doubt any plans his family might have made for a summer holiday. The House of Commons goes into recess tomorrow. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer is to self-isolate after one of his children tested positive, a spokesman says. ""One of Keir's children tested positive for Covid this lunchtime. In line with the rules, Keir and his family will now be self-isolating,"" they said. ""Keir was already doing daily tests and tested negative this morning. He will continue to take daily tests."" Earlier we told you of some of the big name businesses forced to close or reduce services because of the ""pingdemic"". But it's not just household names affected - smaller businesses have told of the disruption caused when staff have to self-isolate. Mrs Salisbury's Tea Rooms in Maldon, Essex is closed until Saturday as co-owner Mike Bloomfield and five staff - half the workforce - are self-isolating after being in contact with a positive Covid case. He says: ""Luckily everybody is negative [for Covid-19] and doing fine at the moment but we still have to do what we have to do and isolate."" Sean Hughes Sean Hughes, who owns pubs in St Albans, says he has been forced to close The Boot due to one member of staff being contacted by NHS Test and Trace and others being pinged by the app. ""We have reduced hours and closed the kitchen for most of this week until they can come back. ""All tests thus far showing negative on a daily basis. It is a complete mess."" You can read more reaction from businesses ownershere. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Nearly a quarter of Taiwan's population have reportedly received one vaccine dose In the last 24 hours, Taiwan has confirmed 16 new local
cases and five further deaths. It has now been five days that Taiwan has
recorded fewer than 20 local cases. Covid-19 restrictions are set to end on Monday, so in the
next couple of days, the Central Epidemic Command Centre will decide whether or
not to relax indoor and outdoor gathering limits, after two months of near
lockdown. Currently, five people are allowed to gather indoors, and 10
outdoors. Since 20 May, all of Taiwan has been in Level 3
restrictions. This is where all but essential businesses are closed, and
mask-wearing is mandatory. Recently, as cases have eased,some sports and entertainment venues have been allowed to reopen. Vaccination is escalating in Taiwan, so the hope is that
this recent, severe wave of Covid-19 will be the last.Local media report,externalthat
23.5% of Taiwanâs 23.5m population have now had one dose of either AstraZeneca
and Moderna. There are warnings, however, that some vaccinations may have
to be postponed in the coming days, due to multiple typhoon warnings. Thanks to early border closures and strict regulations, Taiwan has kept cases relatively low throughout the pandemic. According to Johns Hopkins University it has recorded 15,453 cases and 773 deaths. Â© 2025 BBC.

"The UK has unveiled a new set of demands to redraw the post-Brexit trading arrangements it agreed with the EU for Northern Ireland.

Under its terms, Northern Ireland effectivelyremains part of the EU's single market,externalfor goods, meaning it complies with standards set by Brussels.

"This video can not be played Commuters and children rescued from China floodwaters Twelve people have died after record-breaking rainfall flooded underground railway tunnels in China, leaving passengers trapped in rising waters. Video shared on social media shows evening commuters just managing to keep their heads above water. Water is seen rushing onto platforms. More than 500 people were eventually rescued from the tunnels in Henan province, officials said. Days of rain have caused widespread damage and led to 200,000 evacuations. Above ground, roads have been turned into rivers, with cars and debris swept along in fast moving currents. A number ofpedestrians have had to be rescued. In total, 25 people have died in Henan province and more than a dozen cities are affected. President Xi Jinping said on Wednesday that there had been ""significant loss of life and damage to property"". Several dams and reservoirs have breached warning levels, and soldiers have been mobilised to divert rivers which have burst their banks. Flights and trains in many parts of Henan have also been suspended. In the provincial capital  Zhengzhou, the equivalent of a year's average rainfall has fallen in just three days. On Tuesday, some of the city's flood defences were overwhelmed and water began flowing down into the railway tunnels. Survivors have described how water leaked through the doors, rising slowly from ""our ankles to our knees to our necks"". ""All of us who could, stood on the subway seats,"" one woman wrote on Chinese social network site Weibo. Science failed to predict flood and heat intensity Record heat points to 'extraordinary' extremes Children were lifted out of the water by their parents, while others threw off anything which might hold them down. After about half an hour, one passenger said it became ""hard to breathe"". An order to shut down the line came at 18:10 local time (10:10 GMT) so the evacuation could begin, Zhengzhou government officials said in a statement. Five people are being treated for injuries, with 12 having died. Elsewhere in the central Chinese city, children had to be rescued from a flooded nursery school. State media aired footage of them being floated out in plastic tubs by rescuers. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou Hospital also briefly lost power on Tuesday night, though this has now been restored, said a statement on Weibo by the Zhengzhou Municipal Party Committee. It added that 600 critically ill patients had been transferred to another location. Another resident, identified as Mr Liu, 27, told BBC Chinese he had had ""no water, no electricity, and no internet"". ""Never in my life had I seen so much rain,"" Mr Liu added. ""There was one hour where the rain was just pouring down on us from the heavens, and everything went completely white."" But the rising waters were not just confined to Zhengzhou. A 20-metre (65ft) breach has emerged in the dam in Luoyang city after it was damaged by storms, officials said. Soldiers have been deployed to the area and a statement from the army warned it could ""collapse at any time"". Another user said that residents in Sishui town were stuck on rooftops. ""We don't know how to swimâ¦ the whole village is about to be washed away,"" the person wrote. Henan has experienced ""rare and severe rainfall"" since Saturday, China's meteorological authority said on Wednesday. Zhengzhou saw 624mm of rainfall on Tuesday, with a third of that amount falling between 16:00 and 17:00 alone, which ""smashed historical records"". It forecasted that parts of the region would continue to see ""severe or extremely severe storms"" and that the heavy rain was likely to end only on Thursday. Many factors contribute to flooding, but a warming atmosphere caused by climate change makes extreme rainfall more likely. Part of the Yellow River basin in China, Henan has several major river systems running through the province which are prone to flooding. Zhengzhou, which has a population of 12 million, sits on the banks of the Yellow River itself. Scientists have warned that widespread dam construction has exacerbated climate change problems in China's flood zone, says the BBC's China correspondent Stephen McDonell.

"The protocol means some goods from Great Britain are now subjected to checks at Northern Ireland's ports Northern Ireland's political parties are divided on calls by the government for the EU to begin negotiations to radically amend the Brexit protocol. On Wednesday, Number 10 gave details of some proposals and said a new arrangement was urgently needed. Unionist parties, which oppose the protocol, have welcomed the statement and urged the EU to engage. But Sinn FÃ©in, the SDLP and Alliance urged the government to agree a veterinary agreement to reduce checks. The UK and EU agreed the Northern Ireland Protocol in 2019, as part of the Brexit withdrawal agreement. It prevents a hard border in Ireland by keeping Northern Ireland in the EU single market for goods. The UK says its implementation has been ""unbalanced"" and is ""unsustainable"" in its current form. Brexit Minister Lord Frost said the full deal should not be implemented andcalled on the EU to look at new proposals with ""fresh eyes"". His comments were welcomed by unionist parties in Northern Ireland, who have called for the protocol to be renegotiated as it is damaging Great Britain to Northern Ireland (GB-NI) trade and posing a risk to the union in its current form. What is the Northern Ireland Protocol? Supermarkets warn of rising costs over NI Protocol Government to publish NI Protocol plans in July Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said there was now a ""tacit acceptance"" from the government that the protocol is not working. ""Sticking plasters and short-term fixes were never going to work. We need a proper renegotiation,"" he said. He criticised the EU and said Brussels had ""failed to recognise the concerns of unionists"". DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson wants the Northern Ireland Protocol renegotiated The government has issued a 28 page command paper to accompany today's ministerial statements. But it boils down to one simple sentiment: ""Trust us."" They are telling the EU that it's single market can be protected without the panoply of checks and controls which currently apply to goods entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain. They are suggesting this can largely be achieved through a light-touch, trusted trader scheme and new legislation to discourage smuggling. Brexit veterans will recognise these as the sort of ""alternative arrangements"" suggested earlier in this process. The EU was not persuaded then and with trust in short supply it will be a struggle to persuade them now. The Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader Doug Beattie said he hoped Wednesday's statement would lead to ""movement in the direction of finding pragmatic, workable solutions"". ""I hope that the European Union will take their time in considering these proposals in good faith and will not reject them out of hand,"" he added. The UUP leader will travel to Dublin on Thursday to meet the Taoiseach (Irish PM) MicheÃ¡l Martin to make that case to him directly. Stormont's other main parties - Sinn FÃ©in, the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) and Alliance - have said they recognise concerns about the protocol but that must be fully implemented in the absence of another arrangement. Sinn FÃ©in chairman Declan Kearney said the British government had agreed and ratified all elements of the protocol with the European Commission. ""It should now stop the evasion, and get on with it's implementation,"" he said. ""It is not acceptable for the Tories to adopt an a la carte approach towards the protocol, to rewrite history, and now attempt a renegotiation."" SDLP leader Colum Eastwood described the government's statement on Wednesday as a ""shameless position based on political expedience rather than providing the stability that people, businesses and communities in Northern Ireland need"". He said he believed a resolution was still possible but would require the government to ""step back from its bad faith interventions"". Colum Eastwood described the UK government's approach to the protocol as a ""shameless position"" Alliance's deputy leader Stephen Farry also said the government was attempting to ""rewrite history"" and that their actions had undermined trust with the EU in finding sustainable solutions. His party has supported suggestions from the EU for a temporary Swiss-style veterinary agreement as a way to reduce most checks on goods coming into Northern Ireland from Great Britain. That would require the UK to follow all EU agri-food rules. The UK said it is unwilling to cede control to the EU on this issue and is instead pushing for an equivalence arrangement in which the EU would recognise UK food production standards as being equivalent to its own. Simon Hoare, chairman of Westminster's Northern Ireland Affairs Committee, described the UK's new proposals for the protocol as an ""interesting approach"". ""If there is to be any chance of change, mutual and binding trust will be the key currency. I am fearful that this is in short supply and needs to be worked on energetically and now. ""Common sense and pragmatism must not be a dirty word for either side,"" Mr Hoare added. Earlier, Ireland's Europe minister, Thomas Byrne, said ""there can be no renegotiation of the [NI] protocol"". But he added that the arrangement had its complications, and said Irish government is ""willing to discuss any creative solutions within the confines of the protocol"". The EU has strict rules about the importation of chilled meat products like mince and sausages Ahead of the publication of the UK paper, thechairman of Marks & Spencer Archie Norman warned of the impact of full protocol checkson fresh foods when grace periods end this autumn. ""This Christmas, I can tell you already, we're having to make decisions to delist product for Northern Ireland because it's simply not worth the risk of trying to get it through,"" he said. Mr Norman called for a ""common sense"" solution to post-Brexit problems at his firm's stores on the island of Ireland. The M&S said the level of checks and controls are ""very threatening"" to Marks and Spencer's Irish business. He suggests the easiest solution would be to ""agree a time limited veterinary/food standards agreement"". Speaking on Radio 4 on Wednesday morning, Mr Norman said the problems his company has faced exporting to the Republic of Ireland are likely to be replicated in Northern Ireland by the autumn. ""At the moment only about 80% of our product is getting into [the Republic of] Ireland - so 20% doesn't arrive at all,"" he said. ""It's not the rules of the Customs Union that is the problem, it's the Byzantine and pointless and honestly pettifogging enforcement which means that wagons can't get through."" He said trucks had been turned away on the basis of the wrong colour of typeface used on documents. ""We're employing 13 full-time vets who are not looking after animals or welfare, they're simply ticking boxes and filling out forms,"" he added. ""Sandwiches typically require about three vets' certificates to get through. ""Come October our experience in southern Ireland is probably, as it currently stands, set to be replicated in Northern Ireland.""

"The UK has unveiled a new set of demands to redraw the post-Brexit trading arrangements it agreed with the EU for Northern Ireland. The government said border checks on goods from Great Britain it signed up to in the 2019 Brexit divorce deal had proved unsustainable.

"This video can not be played Commuters and children rescued from China floodwaters Twelve people have died after record-breaking rainfall flooded underground railway tunnels in China, leaving passengers trapped in rising waters. Video shared on social media shows evening commuters just managing to keep their heads above water. Water is seen rushing onto platforms. More than 500 people were eventually rescued from the tunnels in Henan province, officials said. Days of rain have caused widespread damage and led to 200,000 evacuations. Above ground, roads have been turned into rivers, with cars and debris swept along in fast moving currents. A number ofpedestrians have had to be rescued. In total, 25 people have died in Henan province and more than a dozen cities are affected. President Xi Jinping said on Wednesday that there had been ""significant loss of life and damage to property"". Several dams and reservoirs have breached warning levels, and soldiers have been mobilised to divert rivers which have burst their banks. Flights and trains in many parts of Henan have also been suspended. In the provincial capital  Zhengzhou, the equivalent of a year's average rainfall has fallen in just three days. On Tuesday, some of the city's flood defences were overwhelmed and water began flowing down into the railway tunnels. Survivors have described how water leaked through the doors, rising slowly from ""our ankles to our knees to our necks"". ""All of us who could, stood on the subway seats,"" one woman wrote on Chinese social network site Weibo. Science failed to predict flood and heat intensity Record heat points to 'extraordinary' extremes Children were lifted out of the water by their parents, while others threw off anything which might hold them down. After about half an hour, one passenger said it became ""hard to breathe"". An order to shut down the line came at 18:10 local time (10:10 GMT) so the evacuation could begin, Zhengzhou government officials said in a statement. Five people are being treated for injuries, with 12 having died. Elsewhere in the central Chinese city, children had to be rescued from a flooded nursery school. State media aired footage of them being floated out in plastic tubs by rescuers. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou Hospital also briefly lost power on Tuesday night, though this has now been restored, said a statement on Weibo by the Zhengzhou Municipal Party Committee. It added that 600 critically ill patients had been transferred to another location. Another resident, identified as Mr Liu, 27, told BBC Chinese he had had ""no water, no electricity, and no internet"". ""Never in my life had I seen so much rain,"" Mr Liu added. ""There was one hour where the rain was just pouring down on us from the heavens, and everything went completely white."" But the rising waters were not just confined to Zhengzhou. A 20-metre (65ft) breach has emerged in the dam in Luoyang city after it was damaged by storms, officials said. Soldiers have been deployed to the area and a statement from the army warned it could ""collapse at any time"". Another user said that residents in Sishui town were stuck on rooftops. ""We don't know how to swimâ¦ the whole village is about to be washed away,"" the person wrote. Henan has experienced ""rare and severe rainfall"" since Saturday, China's meteorological authority said on Wednesday. Zhengzhou saw 624mm of rainfall on Tuesday, with a third of that amount falling between 16:00 and 17:00 alone, which ""smashed historical records"". It forecasted that parts of the region would continue to see ""severe or extremely severe storms"" and that the heavy rain was likely to end only on Thursday. Many factors contribute to flooding, but a warming atmosphere caused by climate change makes extreme rainfall more likely. Part of the Yellow River basin in China, Henan has several major river systems running through the province which are prone to flooding. Zhengzhou, which has a population of 12 million, sits on the banks of the Yellow River itself. Scientists have warned that widespread dam construction has exacerbated climate change problems in China's flood zone, says the BBC's China correspondent Stephen McDonell. Connections between rivers and lakes have been cut and disrupted flood plains which once absorbed much of the region's annual summer downpours.

major Chinese city has today gone into lockdown, after 17 airport workers
tested positive. According to
Chinaâs officialXinhua News Agency,external, employees at Nanjingâs Lukou International
Airport have tested positive. Nine of those are symptomatic. Flights have
subsequently been cancelled and 500 people have been placed under medical
observation. The local government today announced a citywide testing drive,
which will cover 9.3 million people. Four communities and villages in the city
have now become âmedium riskâ, meaning that local lockdown measures are in
place. Nanjing, in
eastern Jiangsu, is now one of two Chinese cities where there are lockdown
measures in place. There has been an outbreak since early July at the opposite
end of the country in a city called Ruili, which borders Myanmar. There are more
than 200 people currently in hospital in Yunnan province, many in the city of
Ruili. Today, a new testing drive has also been ordered there. Residents in
Ruili have already experienced multiple testing drives throughout the pandemic,
as the city has experienced four waves of the coronavirus. It has a population
of some 270,000 people. This video can not be played Inside India's deadly mucormycosis fungus epidemic Mucormycosis, a rare and deadly infection known as ""black fungus"", has killed more than 4,300 people in India, the health ministry has reported. The country has recorded 45,374 cases of the illness. Doctors say the fungus has a link with the steroids used to treat Covid, and diabetics are at particular risk. But the scale of the problem could be even greater. Dr Raghuraj Hegde, a Bangalore-based eye surgeon who has treated a number of mucormycosis patients, told the BBC that there had been ""massive undercounting of both cases and deaths"" from the disease. ""Typically, deaths in mucormycosis occur weeks to months after getting the disease. Our present systems are not good to capture that data,"" he said.

Rates are also lower among Asian Scots and those of Black or Caribbean heritage, figures from Public Health Scotland show. Other studies have found similarly lower levels of vaccination among ethnic minorities elsewhere in the UK. In Scotland, the difference has been most apparent in the 70 to 74 age range, where first dose uptake is 97.2% for the white ethnic group and 73.7% for the African ethnic group. For the Asian group in this age range, uptake was at 89.7% while the figure for Black or Caribbean Scots was 93.8%. While uptake was high in all age ranges among white Scots, it varied considerably among Black or Caribbean Scots, with uptake ranging from 96.0% in the over 80s to 46.0% in those aged 18-29 years. A further 44,104 people have tested positive for the coronavirus across the UK,government figures,externalshow. Another 73 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were also reported.  Over 39,000 people died of coronavirus in care home settings in England between 10 April 2020 and 31 March this year. Amanda Henry had been unable to see her father Robert, 78, for nearly four weeks - and when she was at last allowed into his care home in Poplar, east London, it was because he was gravely ill. Care homes were struggling to get personal protective equipment and the official guidance they needed. At the time Amanda just wanted to give him some comfort, but even then - in April 2020 - she says she noticed shortcomings with personal protective equipment (PPE). There was not enough of it, it was flimsy, and staff were not using it properly, she claims. Staff were going from room to room, not changing their PPE, not washing their hands between rooms, and some had no PPE at all, she says. ""What I was witnessing was the virus being spread amongst the residents of the care home in real time... ""I feel it tells us that these vulnerable elderly people were disposable to this government... ""I'm angry, I'm angry that my dad had to suffer like that."" Read morehere. More than 39,000 people died of coronavirus in care homes in England in the year from 10 April 2020 to 31 March 2021, new figures suggest. The numbers, released by the Care Quality Commission (CQC), show how the virus spread across the country. The highest number of deaths in a single care home was 44, while 21 homes had more than 30 Covid-related deaths. ""Every number represents a life lost,"" said Kate Terroni, CQC chief inspector for adult social care. Read morehere. The British Retail Consortium (BRC) has urged the government to ensure staff in stores and suppliers should be allowed to work even if they get an alert to self-isolate. The BRC's Andrew Opie said the ""pingdemic"" meant retailers were finding it difficult to maintain opening hours and keep shelves stocked. ""Government needs to act fast. Retail workers and suppliers, who have played a vital role throughout this pandemic, should be allowed to work provided they are double vaccinated or can show a negative Covid test, to ensure there is no disruption to the public's ability to get food and other goods,"" he said. The boss of Iceland supermarkets and leaders at pub chain Greene King have also called for new rulesto avoid crippling shutdowns. Croatia wants tourists to return, but has imposed mandatory testing rules for some Croatia has been on the UK's green list of countries for travel - the lowest level of restriction - since Monday. You can read about the rules for green, amber and red list countrieshere Croatia however has changed the rules for arrivals from the UK, as well as those from Cyprus and Russia. As of Monday 26 July, all visitors from these countries will need proof of a negative Covid test - regardless of whether they've been vaccinated or have proof of recovery from the virus. Tourism accounts for about 20% of the country's economy. But cases have been rising there over the last 10 days, particularly in areas along the Adriatic Coast. On Wednesday, authorities reported 191 new infections in Croatia. Sir Keir Starmer's self-isolation means four of the country's most senior politicians are now quarantining at home. Last week, Health Secretary Sajid Javid tested positive after feeling unwell, leading Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Chancellor Rishi Sunak to isolate at Chequers - the PM's house in Buckinghamshire -  and Downing Street respectively. It has been reported this week that Javid's positive test has forced a raft of senior No 10 and health department officials to self-isolate. It was initially announced that Johnson and Sunak would avoid having to self-isolate through a pilot daily testing programme, but this decisionwas reversed less than three hours later on Sunday. We know Sir Keir was in the Commons earlier for PMQs so it raises the question: if he goes on to develop Covid, how many other politicians will need to self-isolate? As it is announced Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer is to begin self-isolation after one of his children tested positive for Covid (seeearlier posts), let's re-cap the rules he will need to observe. While many restrictions on daily life have now lifted in England, stay-at-home orders for those in close contact with confirmed coronavirus cases have remained in place. Currently, you must self-isolate for 10 days if you test positive, live with someone who tests positive, are told to isolate by NHS Test and Trace, or someone you live with has symptoms. Some fully vaccinated critical workers in England - including health and care staff - will be able to leave isolation to go to work, even if they are traced as a contact of someone with Covid. But these people are specifically named on a letter from a government department in advance of any potential self-isolation order. Changes to the rules around self-isolation for people who are fully vaccinated are due to begin from 16 August in England. Read more about the current ruleshere. The BBC Proms will go ahead at full capacity this year, with audience members ""strongly encouraged"" to wear masks. They will also be required to provide a negative lateral flow test, a positive PCR test or proof of double vaccination. Promming tickets, where audience members can stand in the arena or gallery areas of the Royal Albert Hall, will also be available on the day of each concert. The 2020 edition featured a reduced orchestra playing to an empty auditorium - with the singers placed in the stalls. The return of the fully-fledged event will feature52 concerts over 44 days featuring 30 orchestras and ensembles, more than 100 soloists and conductors and more than 2,000 musicians. The BBC says: ""The safety of our audiences is our main priority and we are taking every step we can to open the Proms safely without social distancing."" Audience members over the age of 18 will be asked to provide a negative lateral flow test taken within 48 hours of the performance, or evidence of double vaccination provided via the NHS app or a letter provided by the NHS. They can also offer proof of natural immunity based upon a positive PCR test taken within 180 days of the performance. Under 18s will be asked for verbal confirmation from a parent or guardian that they have not received a positive test. The BBC Proms opens on 30 July and runs until 11 September. The news that Sir Keir Starmer has begun self-isolation comes just hours after he described a ""summer of chaos"" amid soaring numbers of people self-isolating at home. Starmer dubbed PM Boris Johnson - who is himself self-isolating in Buckinghamshire - the ""Chequers one"" as he mocked Johnson's isolation on the same week most remaining curbs lifted in England. Speaking in the Commons, Starmer said: ""Everything may be calm from the prime minister's country retreat but back here the truth is we're heading for a summer of chaos."" It is the fourth time Labour leader has self-isolated after coming in close contact with a confirmed Covid case since the pandemic began. Starmer isolated inJanuary,December and September last year after being notified that an associate had tested positive. Given his child's positive test came at lunchtime, Starmer may have to self-isolate until 31 July - potentially throwing into doubt any plans his family might have made for a summer holiday. The House of Commons goes into recess tomorrow. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer is to self-isolate after one of his children tested positive, a spokesman says. ""One of Keir's children tested positive for Covid this lunchtime. In line with the rules, Keir and his family will now be self-isolating,"" they said. ""Keir was already doing daily tests and tested negative this morning. He will continue to take daily tests."" Earlier we told you of some of the big name businesses forced to close or reduce services because of the ""pingdemic"". But it's not just household names affected - smaller businesses have told of the disruption caused when staff have to self-isolate. Mrs Salisbury's Tea Rooms in Maldon, Essex is closed until Saturday as co-owner Mike Bloomfield and five staff - half the workforce - are self-isolating after being in contact with a positive Covid case. He says: ""Luckily everybody is negative [for Covid-19] and doing fine at the moment but we still have to do what we have to do and isolate."" Sean Hughes Sean Hughes, who owns pubs in St Albans, says he has been forced to close The Boot due to one member of staff being contacted by NHS Test and Trace and others being pinged by the app. ""We have reduced hours and closed the kitchen for most of this week until they can come back. ""All tests thus far showing negative on a daily basis. It is a complete mess."" You can read more reaction from businesses ownershere.

"Marks & Spencer has warned it is already cutting Christmas products in Northern Ireland due to concerns over forthcoming post-Brexit customs checks. Chairman Archie Norman told Radio Four's Today Programme the changes could mean higher prices and less choice for Northern Ireland customers. Mr Norman said current ""pointless"" checks with the Republic of Ireland were ""threatening"" to its business. He called for a ""common sense approach to enforcement."" TheUK is expected later to warn the EU it is prepared to unilaterally override the Brexit arrangements for Northern Ireland if a simplified agreement cannot be reached. Right now, supermarkets who send products there from Great Britain face only light-touch checks, under a so-called ""grace period"" which delayed some of the new processes. That runs out at the end of September. The Northern Ireland Protocol helps prevent the need for checks on the island of Ireland's internal border. But in the first warning from a major retailer on the scale of the potential problems, former Conservative party MP Mr Norman said once light-touch export checks end, there will be ""gaps on the shelves"". ""This Christmas, I can tell you already, we're having to make decisions to delist product for Northern Ireland because it's simply not worth the risk of trying to get it through,"" he said. ""We've already made that decision. We're waiting to see how serious it's going to be but if it's anything like southern Ireland (the Republic of Ireland), and at the moment it's set to be, then it's going to be very, very serious for customers."" Marks and Spencer is a major employer in Ireland, with more than 4,000 staff. In a letter to Brexit minister Lord Frost, Mr Norman said the current EU customs arrangements were ""totally unsuited and were never designed for a modern fresh food supply chain between closely intertwined trading partners"". ""There is no other outcome for consumers in Northern Ireland in the end other than higher prices, given the inflationary pressures being put on to retailers by the regulatory regime,"" Mr Norman wrote. ""Being able to keep the show on the road, let alone growing, is going to be very challenging,"" he added. Mr Norman told the BBC that ""pettifogging enforcement"" of the rules required M&S to employ 14 full-time vets, ""simply ticking boxes and filling out forms"", in order to certify its products. ""Sandwiches typically require three veterinary certificates to get through,"" he said. Because of the way the system worked, M&S had had to give up exporting half its sandwich range to Ireland, he said. If forms were filled in incorrectly, that meant delays, with everything on paper and nothing digital, Mr Norman said. ""If one page is blue instead of black typeface, the entire wagon is turned away,"" he added. Mr Norman said that if the same regime was replicated in Northern Ireland at the end of September, it would be ""incendiary"" for the public there. What's the Northern Ireland Protocol? DUP sets out seven tests for NI Brexit deal M&S marks 50 years of trading in Belfast Mr Norman said M&S was one of the largest UK-based retailers operating in Ireland as a whole and played ""a disproportionate role"" in Northern Ireland. ""Our market share in Northern Ireland is almost double our share on the UK mainland. In part, this reflects our history as the only major UK retailer that committed to trade and invest continuously through the Troubles,"" he said. ""Our commitment and involvement with the people and communities of Northern Ireland remains strong. We are also a major employer and investor with over 4,000 people employed directly by M&S and many more in our supply chain."" He added that last year, M&S invested more than Â£10m in the business in Northern Ireland. However, the issues raised by the current customs arrangements, in which Northern Ireland remains part of the EU Single Market while the rest of the UK has left, were ""very threatening to our business"", he said. Ireland's European affairs minister Thomas Byrne said it was willing to discuss ""any creative solutions"". ""But we have to recognise as well that Britain decided itself to leave the single market of the European Union, to apply trade rules, to apply red tape to its goods that are leaving Britain, to goods that are coming into Britain,"" he added. The EU has said a temporary Swiss-style veterinary agreement for Northern Ireland, in which the UK continues to follow EU agri-food rules, could be a solution, but it has been rejected by the UK. In his letter, Mr Norman said he understood why the UK government was ""not favourably disposed"" to this solution, although he added that it was ""by far the best way of delivering a smooth trade flow"". Regardless of this, he added, many problems could be solved by a willingness to overlook ""trivial"" errors in paperwork and efforts to set up a ""trusted trader"" scheme. ""Any scheme should start on the basis that we are prepared to follow EU standards for products going to Northern Ireland,"" he said. ""The debate is not about meeting standards, this is about what we are required to do to show we are compliant."" Number 10 said Mr Norman's letter was a ""stark warning"" of ""the fundamental problems with the Protocol"". ""That is why we need to urgently tackle these issues, to ensure there is minimal disruption to people's lives in Northern Ireland, as the Protocol itself intended,"" it added. It plans to set out details later on its approach to the Northern Ireland Protocol. The sort of products M&S is considering taking off the list for Northern Ireland this Christmas are ones containing a lot of different ingredients. For example, special occasion food like pies or pates, which people might order for a celebration. Today, the company's chairman wants to send a message that the way post-Brexit rules on trade with EU countries have been implemented is making it extremely difficult to get products over to the Republic of Ireland, forcing the retailer to cut back the range it sells there. And he fears Northern Ireland is heading the same way. It won't be a co-incidence that Archie Norman's intervention comes just before we expect to hear more on the government's proposals. He presents an argument for introducing less disruptive trade processes after the grace periods expire. Whether the EU will accept that is a whole other question.

"Travellers to England from green and amber list countries may no longer face Covid checks on arrival - according to a union representing border staff. Officers will no longer routinely verify arrivals have tested negative before departure or completed a passenger locator form, the ISU said. The Guardianfirst reported,externalthe change and said it aimed to reduce queues. The government said carriers were checking all necessary requirements including forms and test bookings. A spokesperson added: ""This legal requirement on carriers is underpinned by a robust compliance regime, which is overseen by regulators. ""Compliance with these rules is essential in order to protect the population from new variants of Covid-19, and so there will be tough fines for those who do not follow the rules."" Airlines UK, which represents easyJet, Tui and British Airways among others, said: ""Carriers are committed to working with Border Force on these requirements, which is why compliance has remained consistently extremely high."" But Labour's shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds accused the government of ""yet more staggering incompetence"" and added: ""They must - urgently - get a grip."" How have summer holiday rules changed? Your travel guide to seven Mediterranean countries From Monday, carriers were asked to begin checking vaccine status certification. They were already legally required to ensure passengers have completed necessary requirements before travelling. The Guardian said it had seen a leaked memo that told border staff they no longer had to search for a passenger locator form when the computer system failed to find one. The memo also reportedly confirmed that electronic border gates ""will no longer refer passengers to in-person checks by Border Force officers if a passenger locator form is not found"". The memo, which the Guardian said became operational on Monday as other restrictions eased in England, has not been seen by the BBC. Border Force officers were previously instructed to check 100% of passenger Covid documentation at the border - a direction blamed by some for contributing to queues of up to six hours. Previously about 10% of passenger Covid documentation had been checked. But Lucy Moreton, of the ISU trade union, confirmed the reported memo was accurate. ""Ultimately this is a political decision,"" Ms Moreton said. ""Certainly, it will reduce queue times significantly and hopefully also the level of verbal abuse to which Border Force staff are subject. ""That is welcome to us. The impact on the UK's Covid security is ultimately a scientific determination."" Transport Secretary Grant Shappshas warned of continuing disruption to travel, saying passengers should expect much of that to be focused at check-in and before travel, rather than at the border. All arrivals regardless of where they are coming from abroad are required to test negative before departure and have valid proof of their test status. They are also required to conduct another test two days after their arrival, and prove this is organised pre-departure. All travellers to the UK must complete a passenger locator form with basic details including an address. Those arriving from amber list countries, who are not fully vaccinated, must also complete a further test on day eight and quarantine at an address listed on the form. People who have been fully vaccinated are no longer required to carry out home quarantine when arriving from an amber list country. Arrivals from red list countries must quarantine in a government-approved hotel for 10 days, at a cost of at least Â£1,750 per adult. Additional reporting by George Bowden.

"The UK has unveiled a new set of demands to redraw the post-Brexit trading arrangements it agreed with the EU for Northern Ireland. The government said border checks on goods from Great Britain it signed up to in the 2019 Brexit divorce deal had proved unsustainable. Brexit Minister Lord Frost said they risked harming business, and were damaging the ""fabric"" of the UK. The EU said it would not agree to renegotiate the terms of the 2019 deal. The checks are included in the Northern Ireland Protocol, a section of the Brexit deal designed to avoid border checks on the island of Ireland. Lord Frost called on the EU to look on the UK's proposals with ""fresh eyes,"" adding: ""We cannot go on as we are."" M&S to cut Christmas products in Northern Ireland No renegotiation on Protocol as UK warns of action DUP leader calls for renegotiation of Brexit deal What is the Northern Ireland Protocol? However, he announced the UK would not be triggering Article 16 of the protocol - which would allow it to suspend parts of the Brexit deal - before talks with Brussels. He added that the government believed using it was justifiable, but said: ""Nevertheless, we have concluded that it is not the right moment to do so."" Lord Frost told the House of Lords there was a ""growing sense in Northern Ireland we have not found the right balance, seen in an ongoing febrile political climate, protests and regrettable instances of occasional disorder"". He also called on the EU to agree a ""standstill period"" to prevent a ban on sending chilled meat products such as sausages from Great Britain coming into force in September, when the full terms of the deal kick in. He later told reporters it was ""perfectly normal to change treaties in the light of experience, and it happens all the time"". In a28-page document,external, the UK government suggested changes to: remove customs checks on goods where the GB-registered businesses sending them have declared their final destination is Northern Ireland get rid of certificates and checks for food products ""only ever intended to be consumed in Northern Ireland"" remove medicines entirely from the scope of the protocol allowing labelled goods conforming to UK rules to circulate freely in Northern Ireland alongside EU-registered products The future of the Irish border was a huge sticking point during Brexit talks The protocol was agreed to prevent the return of a hard border between the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland, as both the UK and EU want to prevent any return to the Troubles, which lasted 30 years and cost more than 3,500 lives. Under its terms, Northern Ireland effectivelyremains part of the EU's single market,externalfor goods, meaning it complies with standards set by Brussels. The biggest practical difficulty, in trade terms, concerns the movement of food from Britain to Northern Ireland, which could then be transported into the EU via the Irish land border. The prime minister's former chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, has told BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg that the protocol had been a ""fudge"". Both sides had wanted to ""sign up to something that was not what either side really wanted and which punted difficult questions into the future to figure out later"", he added. This video can not be played Brexit deal was ""inherently self-contradictory in various ways,"" says Dominic Cummings European Commission Vice-President MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ said the EU was willing to ""seek creative solutions within the framework of the protocol"" to ease border issues. But he added the 27-member union would not agree to a ""renegotiation"" of the Brexit deal. ""Respecting international legal obligations is of paramount importance,"" he added. DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said: ""We welcome the acceptance from the government that the protocol is not working, that it is causing real harm to our economy in Northern Ireland and it is simply not sustainable."" He called the UK government's statement - and its publication of a command paper describing its demands - an ""important first step"". However, Sinn Fein Brexit spokesperson Declan Kearney called on the UK government to ""stop the evasion"" and ""get on"" with implementing the deal it agreed. ""It is not acceptable for the Tories to adopt an a la carte approach towards the protocol, to rewrite history, and now attempt a renegotiation,"" he added. Industry group Manufacturing NI said the UK's proposals would create ""confusion and uncertainty for business"" and were likely to ""create conflict with the EU"". It called on the EU to ""go further to ensure the UK's market works for business and consumers in Northern Ireland"". ""Both parties owe it to the people in Northern Ireland to skip the drama and get on with dialogue and decision making,"" the body added.

"The murder of Sarah Everard sparked a national outcry, spurring women to share their experiences of feeling unsafe on the streets. Many included a sense of the teller lining themselves up shoulder-to-shoulder with her: ""She was the same age as me"", ""I used to live near her"", ""I've walked the same route"". Ms Everard didn't set herself up to be such an everywoman, a symbol of longstanding - and ongoing - violence against women. She had no choice in her name becoming a battle cry for change. The private, excoriating grief of friends and family seems to have been subsumed by the wider - albeit important and valid - reactions of protest and polemic, marches and mass mourning. Sarah Everard was a daughter, sister, friend and colleague. According to those in the know, she was dreadful at karaoke but ""brilliant"" at everything else. There were just 38 minutes between the time this ""clever, articulate and caring"" woman left a friend's house and the last time she was seen. The final image of her, captured by a bus camera, also showed a white Vauxhall Astra with its hazard lights on and both front doors open. The car had been hired specifically for kidnapping a woman. It was returned to the rental company the following morning, having served its purpose. Sarah Everard was dead. Her body was found a week later in a woodland stream in Ashford, Kent, where her killer owned a patch of land. A complete stranger, a police officer, had kidnapped, raped and murdered her. He knew what he was doing, this man who killed her for his own gratuitous wants. Outwardly, he had what appeared to be a perfectly ordinary life. A responsible job. Wife and children. A house in Deal in Kent he shared with them. But the 48-year-old officer's faÃ§ade hid the actions of a sexual predator who had been planning the crime - although not yet selecting his victim - in chilling detail. On 28 February, three days before he killed Ms Everard, he had been accused of indecent exposure in a branch of McDonald's. It wasn't the first time. The very same day, he bought a roll of self-adhesive plastic described as ""carpet protector"" and booked the hire car he would use to abduct the marketing executive. He arranged for time off work. After he killed Ms Everard, he bought builders' bags, a tarpaulin and a cargo net, wiped his phone and concocted an implausible and time-wasting web of lies about his involvement in her disappearance. That they won't have to sit through the grisly evidence and twisted lies of a trial must be scant relief to her loved ones. Ms Everard should have had a brilliant future, a lot to look forward to. She had bounced back after a relationship breakup and was seeing someone new. She had just started a new job. She, her boyfriend Josh Lowth and four others were planning a trip to Ibiza at the end of summer. One of Ms Everard's friends said: ""What I loved about her was that she had depth. She wasn't a vapid, nice person. She had opinions, sarcasm and wanted things to be better. ""We could trust her to fight the good fight."" Ms Everard grew up in York, with an older brother and sister. Her father was a professor and her mother a charity worker. Described by her family as ""bright and beautiful"", ""kind and thoughtful"", ""caring and dependable"", she ""always put others first and had the most amazing sense of humour. She was strong and principled and a shining example to us all"". Rose Woollard has been a close friend of Ms Everard since university, and was one of the first to become alarmed. She contacted the BBC in an attempt to raise awareness before Ms Everard's disappearance had become an official police investigation. Met PC pleads guilty to Sarah Everard murder Couzens was accused of indecent exposure in 2015 Ms Woollard said: ""Sarah has always been an exceptional friend, dropping everything to be there to support her friends, whenever they need her. ""It was only recently that she was telling me the good news about her new role, which she was excited to start."" ""She was sunshine and light, and made you feel warm and good and safe,"" said another friend. ""I feel angry about it as well, but my main anger is that it happened to her."" A former colleague said: ""Sometimes you meet a person with a beautiful soul and it shines through. ""There is nothing anyone can say that will make things better for her family and loved ones. They must be in hell. I can only say that Sarah was a very special person and will be missed by so many."" The uproar over Ms Everard's death, and what she has come to represent, led one friend to say: ""I would like to just say who she was to me, as a person. ""Finding the right words is so hard. ""I can't sum her up in a few well-chosen words, nor express what she meant to me by sharing memories. I can only skim the surface now in the wake of the horror and the anger, and work through the rest alone in the weeks and months to follow. ""Sarah was open. Honest. Unflinching in her ability to listen and empathise. There are some people you know for a relatively short time, but whom you instantly strike up a close bond with due to your similarities - Sarah was one of these people. We shared a lot, and I was never in any doubt of her discretion or sincerity in her support and kindness. We laughed, we cried. We talked about the future. ""She should be here."" A simple post on Facebook on 14 June said: ""Happy Birthday Sarah Everard. I miss you today, and every single day"". When she was taken, Ms Everard was less than a mile from her flat in Brixton. The killer had been cruising around for more than four hours before he saw her for the first time. Years of predatory behaviour, days of planning, hours of scouting, and mere minutes to trap his prey. This was a decision he made. It was not a frenzied attack in which a person loses self-control. It was cool-headed and clinical. Investigators are looking into the hypothesis he used his police ID card as a means to stop Ms Everard, under the guise of questioning her about Covid restrictions. At any point he could have driven away. He chose not to.

"The UK has unveiled a new set of demands to redraw the post-Brexit trading arrangements it agreed with the EU for Northern Ireland. The government said border checks on goods from Great Britain it signed up to in the 2019 Brexit divorce deal had proved unsustainable. Brexit Minister Lord Frost said they risked harming business, and were damaging the ""fabric"" of the UK. The EU said it would not agree to renegotiate the terms of the 2019 deal. The checks are included in the Northern Ireland Protocol, a section of the Brexit deal designed to avoid border checks on the island of Ireland. Lord Frost called on the EU to look on the UK's proposals with ""fresh eyes,"" adding: ""We cannot go on as we are."" M&S to cut Christmas products in Northern Ireland No renegotiation on Protocol as UK warns of action DUP leader calls for renegotiation of Brexit deal What is the Northern Ireland Protocol? However, he announced the UK would not be triggering Article 16 of the protocol - which would allow it to suspend parts of the Brexit deal - before talks with Brussels. He added that the government believed using it was justifiable, but said: ""Nevertheless, we have concluded that it is not the right moment to do so."" Lord Frost told the House of Lords there was a ""growing sense in Northern Ireland we have not found the right balance, seen in an ongoing febrile political climate, protests and regrettable instances of occasional disorder"". He also called on the EU to agree a ""standstill period"" to prevent a ban on sending chilled meat products such as sausages from Great Britain coming into force in September, when the full terms of the deal kick in. He later told reporters it was ""perfectly normal to change treaties in the light of experience, and it happens all the time"". In a28-page document,external, the UK government suggested changes to: remove customs checks on goods where the GB-registered businesses sending them have declared their final destination is Northern Ireland get rid of certificates and checks for food products ""only ever intended to be consumed in Northern Ireland"" remove medicines entirely from the scope of the protocol allowing labelled goods conforming to UK rules to circulate freely in Northern Ireland alongside EU-registered products The future of the Irish border was a huge sticking point during Brexit talks The protocol was agreed to prevent the return of a hard border between the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland, as both the UK and EU want to prevent any return to the Troubles, which lasted 30 years and cost more than 3,500 lives. Under its terms, Northern Ireland effectivelyremains part of the EU's single market,externalfor goods, meaning it complies with standards set by Brussels. The biggest practical difficulty, in trade terms, concerns the movement of food from Britain to Northern Ireland, which could then be transported into the EU via the Irish land border. The prime minister's former chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, has told BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg that the protocol had been a ""fudge"". Both sides had wanted to ""sign up to something that was not what either side really wanted and which punted difficult questions into the future to figure out later"", he added. This video can not be played Brexit deal was ""inherently self-contradictory in various ways,"" says Dominic Cummings European Commission Vice-President MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ said the EU was willing to ""seek creative solutions within the framework of the protocol"" to ease border issues. But he added the 27-member union would not agree to a ""renegotiation"" of the Brexit deal. ""Respecting international legal obligations is of paramount importance,"" he added. DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said: ""We welcome the acceptance from the government that the protocol is not working, that it is causing real harm to our economy in Northern Ireland and it is simply not sustainable."" He called the UK government's statement - and its publication of a command paper describing its demands - an ""important first step"". However, Sinn Fein Brexit spokesperson Declan Kearney called on the UK government to ""stop the evasion"" and ""get on"" with implementing the deal it agreed. ""It is not acceptable for the Tories to adopt an a la carte approach towards the protocol, to rewrite history, and now attempt a renegotiation,"" he added. Industry group Manufacturing NI said the UK's proposals would create ""confusion and uncertainty for business"" and were likely to ""create conflict with the EU"". It called on the EU to ""go further to ensure the UK's market works for business and consumers in Northern Ireland"". ""Both parties owe it to the people in Northern Ireland to skip the drama and get on with dialogue and decision making,"" the body added. For Labour, Brexit spokeswoman Baroness Chapman urged the government to ""fix the problems the prime minister created"". ""Communities are tired of these games and the political stalemate,"" she added.

"Thomas Barrack speaking at the Republican National Convention in 2016 Billionaire and long-time Donald Trump ally Thomas J Barrack has been arrested in Los Angeles for allegedly acting as an agent of a foreign government. The 74-year-old investment firm founder served as a key adviser to the former US president's 2016 campaign, and was considered a top fundraiser. Mr Barrack is accused of illegally lobbying on behalf of the United Arab Emirates during and after the campaign. A spokesman for Mr Barrack said he planned to plead not guilty. He is the latest ex-Trump official to face federal charges. Mr Barrack is charged with conspiracy, obstruction of justice and making multiple false statements to the FBI during a 2019 interview. Also charged are Matthew Grimes, 27 - who works for Mr Barrack - and UAE citizen Rashid Sultan Rashid Al Malik Alshahhi, 43, according to the seven-pageindictment,external. Acting Assistant Attorney General Mark Lesko said the conduct alleged in the indictment was ""nothing short of a betrayal"" of US officials including Mr Trump himself. The three men are accused of seeking to advance the interests of the UAE government both by influencing Trump officials and through media appearances. In May 2016 Mr Barrack is alleged to have inserted language praising the UAE into a Trump campaign speech. An advanced draft of the speech was allegedly sent to Mr Alshahhi to pass on to UAE officials. The defendants are also alleged to have received ""talking points"" from senior UAE officials for use in media appearances. ""After one appearance in which Barrack repeatedly praised the UAE, Barrack emailed Alshahhi, 'I nailed it... for the home team,' referring to the UAE,"" the charging document states. The men also allegedly agreed to promote the candidacy of a UAE-favoured individual to serve as US ambassador to Abu Dhabi. In December 2016 - following the election - Mr Barrack is also alleged to have advised Mr Grimes and Mr Alshahhi to create a ""wish list"" of US foreign policy items that the UAE wanted to see accomplished during the Trump administration. While Mr Barrack and Mr Grimes were both arrested in California on Tuesday morning, Mr Alshahhi remains at large. With the announcement, Mr Barrack becomes the latest Trump aide to face criminal charges, including former campaign chairman Paul Manafort and former Trump Organization lawyer Michael Cohen. Donald Trump may be out of office, but members of his inner circle are still in the prosecutorial cross-hairs. Tom Barrack is just the latest target. It's difficult to overstate Barrack's ties to Trump over the course of their four-decade friendship. He was instrumental, for instance, in convincing then-candidate Trump to hire Paul Manafort as his campaign manager and helped fill out senior staff positions. Now, like Manafort and other Trump associates, Barrack faces accusations of using his ties to Trump to advance the interests of a foreign government. It's yet another indication that during Trump's campaign and the early days of his presidency, nations sought to take advantage of the novice nature of Trump's political team to gain influence over US foreign policy - both above the table and under it. Barrack and Trump reportedly have had a falling out, but their ties run deep. If he wants to talk about Trump's past activities, prosecutors may be inclined to listen.

"Netflix has confirmed that it will include video games as part of subscription packages at no extra cost. In a letter to investors, it said it was in the early stages of expanding into games and those for mobile would be added to the platform first. ""The time is right to learn more about how our members value games,"" it said on Tuesday. But Netflix shares dipped in after-hours trading after it missed a target on subscriptions. The California-based company said it expects to sign up 3.5 million new customers in the three months to the end of September - less than the 5.86 million analysts had estimated. ""Covid has created some lumpiness in our membership growth (higher growth in 2020, slower growth this year), which is working its way through,"" it said in its latest financial update. ""We continue to focus on improving our service for our members and bringing them the best stories from around the world."" It now counts more than 209 million paid-up members in total, having seen a surge in sign-ups when consumers were spending more time at home during coronavirus-related lockdowns. Netflix: Four things which have driven its success Streaming TV giants face tighter UK regulation But the pandemic has proven a double-edged sword for Netflix, because it disrupted the production of some big titles. ""Covid and its variants make predicting the future hard, but with productions largely running smoothly so far, we're optimistic,"" it said, pointing to new seasons of the series ""Sex Education"" and ""Never Have I Ever"". Despite the slowdown on-set, in the three months to the end of June the firm's revenues totalled $7.3bn - about 19% higher than a year before. Profits dipped to $1.35bn, down from $1.7bn the previous quarter, citing additional investment in improving its apps and non-English language content. Omar Sy stars in French-language hit series Lupin Netflix said it is continuing to put more money into production and that it was keen to ""increase our share of screen time in the US and around the world"". Given that the firm faces increasingly stiff competition from new streaming services entering the market, such as Disney+ or Amazon Prime, gaming could provide Netflix with a unique offer, building on efforts such as an interactive episode of Black Mirror called ""Bandersnatch"". Independent telecoms analyst Paolo Pescatore said that this could prove costly: ""The company will have to dedicate significant resources including time and investment with no guaranteed success. ""For sure this is a long-term play as Netflix needs to strongly think about retention and engagement."" He also cautioned that competition in the gaming industry is even tougher and it could be years before the streaming giant could establish itself in that market. Netflix has recently announced a number of moves in order to aid its transition, such as hiring Mike Verdu who used to work for gaming company Electronic Arts (EA) as its vice president of game development, as well as reportedly expanding its deal with the Bridgerton creator Shonda Rhimes to include gaming.

"Lulu Lakatos allegedly posed as a gemologist who examined the stones at Boodles in central London A woman stole diamonds worth Â£4.2m from a jewellers by swapping them with pebbles using ""sleight of hand"", a court has heard. Lulu Lakatos, 60, allegedly posed as a gemologist who examined the stones from Boodles in central London. Ms Lakatos valued seven diamonds at the New Bond Street store before placing them into a bag, a jury was told. But when the bag was opened, inside were seven small pebbles, Southwark Crown Court heard. ""The diamonds had been stolen by the defendant by sleight of hand,"" prosecutor Philip Stott said. ""The conspiracy in which she is alleged to have played an integral and central part was one of the highest possible sophistication, planning, risk, and reward."" Ms Lakatos, who was born in Romania but lived in France, denies conspiracy to steal on or before 10 March 2016. The court heard that, in February 2016, Boodles chairman Nicholas Wainwright was introduced to a man calling himself ""Simon Glas"", who said he was interested in buying high-value diamonds as an investment. The pair met in Monaco the following month, where Mr Wainwright was introduced to Glas's business partner, a Russian called ""Alexander"", and the sale of seven high-value diamonds was agreed after further discussions. The gems, worth a total of Â£4.2m, included a 20-carat heart-shaped diamond valued at more than Â£2.2m and a three-carat pear-shaped fancy pink diamond worth Â£1.1m. A gem valuer, ""Anna"", instructed by the buyers was due to examine the stones before they were put in a locked bag to be held by Boodles until the jewellers received the funds. Ms Lakatos was allegedly the woman posing as Anna, who was escorted into the jewellers' basement meeting room on 10 March by Mr Wainwright and the firm's own gemologist, Emma Barton. Mr Stott said Ms Lakatos purported to examine and weigh each of the seven diamonds before individually wrapping them in pre-cut tissue paper and placing them inside opaque boxes. ""When the examination was complete, the boxes were placed into a zippable purse-like bag, which was then padlocked shut,"" he told the jury. The prosecutor said Ms Lakatos placed the locked bag inside her own handbag when Mr Wainwright went upstairs. ""It seems it was swapped for an identical locked bag,"" Mr Stott said. Mr Stott said Ms Lakatos, from the Saint-Brieuc region of north-western France, discarded her hat and scarf and changed her clothes in a pub toilet, switching her dark coat for a light one, assisted by another accomplice. She then used her own passport to leave London on the Eurostar, the court heard. Ms Lakatos was arrested in France on a European Arrest Warrant in September last year before being extradited to the UK. The trial continues.
