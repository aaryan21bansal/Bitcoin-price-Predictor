Brexit backlash and 'wonder drug',"Several of the papers lead on what theDaily Mail describes as ""the best heart drug since statins"",external. Scientists are said to have found that a new drug, given by injection every three months, can cut the risk of heart attacks by a quarter. It is called Canakinumab and works by reducing inflammation. The Sun calls it a ""wonder drug"",externalthat ""slashes the risk"" of cancer too. The i newspaper hails the dawn,externalof ""a new era in heart disease treatment"" but says the price will have to come down before it can be approved. The Times says the drug currently costs,externalÂ£40,000 per patient per year as an arthritis treatment - so that could delay widespread use of the medicine alongside statins as a heart treatment. According to the Guardian,external, Jeremy Corbyn is facing a backlash from senior MPs in Labour's heartlands because of the party's ""shift to soft Brexit"". Three of them, from the Midlands and northern England, have told the paper that the move risks alienating thousands of voters in traditional seats who support greater controls on immigration. TheFinancial Times,externalsays Labour's announcement is putting Theresa May under renewed pressure from her own party over Brexit. Pro-European Conservatives, the paper says, will be emboldened to urge the prime minister to accept a softer deal. One unnamed senior pro-remain Tory is quoted as saying: ""The leverage among soft-Brexit Tories has increased significantly"". Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning,external The Times leads on the case of a white, Christian five-year-old girl,externalwho, it says, has been taken from her family and forced to live with a foster carer who wears a niqab. In an internal report seen by the Times, a supervisor at Tower Hamlets council in London describes the child sobbing and begging not to be sent back to the foster carer's home because ""they don't speak English"". The council put out a statement saying:  ""All our foster carers receive training and support from the council to ensure they are fully qualified to meet the needs of the children in their care."" ""Charles must be our king"" is the bold messagespelt out in a purple box on the front of the Sun,external, pointing to an article inside by the paper's famed royal photographer, Arthur Edwards. He has decided to speak out after a recent poll suggested 51% want Prince William to be the next monarch. Edwards disagrees: ""The monarchy doesn't work like that. It's not an X Factor vote. Charles will be our next king, it's his birthright."" The photographer says his job has given him a unique insight into Charles's mindset - he's educated, passionate and very bright, has been heir for 65 years - and will be a good king. Finally, back to Brexit and theDaily Express reports a surge in vacuum cleaner sales,externalas shoppers rush to beat an EU ban on the most powerful models. ""Buy now while stocks last"", the paper says. ""It is a British person's inalienable right to have a vacuum cleaner of such ferocity that it sucks up your underlay and your floorboards.""

Murder arrest after toddler's body found,"The house in Beaford Road, Wythenshawe has been cordoned off while police investigate A 31-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder after the body of a toddler was found by police. The youngster was found dead at a house in Beaford Road, Wythenshawe, Manchester, at about 00:05 BST. A man and a woman, who suffered serious injuries, had left for hospital before officers arrived following a report of a domestic disturbance. A post-mortem examination into the boy's death is due to take place. The arrested man is in police custody. Police are waiting to speak to the woman who is in a serious condition in hospital. It has emerged officers had been to the address on Friday after a similar incident was reported. Supt John-Paul Ruffle said it was an ""absolutely tragic case"" Supt John-Paul Ruffle, of Greater Manchester Police (GMP), said the investigation into that domestic disturbance was continuing. Police have cordoned off the property while investigations take place and more officers are expected to be in the area over the coming days. Neighbours said they were woken by the sounds of sirens from police cars and ambulances. Paul Dean said: ""It's a very quiet road, this is the first time in the 10 years I've been here that something like this has happened. ""To find out it's a child involved, a very young child, it's horrible, a horrible feeling."" Another said: ""I have seen a little boy play outside from time to time, but I have never spoken to anyone who lives there."" Another added they thought a man, woman and child had lived at the address for about three months. Supt Ruffle said: ""This is an absolutely tragic case and I know the community will be horrified and saddened to hear the tragic news this morning. ""I want to offer my reassurances that we have launched a full murder investigation and have a team of detectives working on this case to establish exactly what has led to this young boy's death."" Greater Manchester Police will be referring itself to the Independent Police Complaints Commission as it had previously been called to the property.

Too poor to flee the hurricane,"Judie McRae did not have the means to flee before the storm struck In the detritus of Hurricane Harvey a splash of red, white and blue catches the eye. It is a rain-sodden American flag, half-hidden under the green leaves of fallen trees. A few paces away Judie McRae, 44, is inspecting the damage to her trailer home. Judie has lived more than half of her life here but she says this is her first hurricane. She spent it hunkered down in bed, unable to sleep. She does not want to see another one. ""I just felt like my roof was going to come off at any minute,"" she says, describing a terrible sound of ""cracking and creaking"" that only stopped for a few minutes of calm when the eye of the hurricane  passed directly over her head. ""I was very fortunate that only two little windows got broke,"" she says. Exactly how fortunate is obvious. Three of her neighbours' houses lie in ruins. Sheet metal has been twisted out of shape and insulation foam hangs from the trees. Books and clothes are soaking in the rain. One powder blue trailer home has caved in completely, its wooden skeleton broken and exposed. As we examine the damage a young man arrives, agitated. He asks us if we have checked inside for the owner. We have not. ""Dan, are you in here?"" he shouts. We climb into the wreckage to help search for Dan, gingerly stepping over the missing man's possessions and clambering around his bathtub. There is no-one here. Judie, meanwhile, is worried about two other neighbours. Both got out before the storm struck and have not yet returned to learn that their homes are destroyed. She is particularly concerned about the elderly woman who lives two trailers along. ""She has no money and that was her home and it was already crap so..."" Judie tails off as if she can think of no useful way to complete the thought, no hope to offer. Meanwhile, down on the shore of Rockport, Robert Zbranek, 56, is trying to secure his boat to the dock after it broke free during the storm. Alongside, a small sailing yacht is under water. The yacht, Robert explains, was his home. He was inside when the hurricane swept over, smashing the hull. At the height of the most powerful storm in Texas since 1961, with winds blowing at 130mph (215km/h), he had to get out and scramble into his car, which he had parked behind a truck for shelter. Even then he did not feel safe as, he says, the vehicle was lifted off the ground by the high winds but it worked. What was it like? ""Rough,"" he laughs. I suggest that some people might question his sanity. This video can not be played The BBC's James Cook found a scene of devastation in Rockport ""I know I'm crazy,"" he says with a smile. ""It was supposed to be a category two, maybe a category three but it didn't turn out that way. It was absolutely ridiculous. Ferocious."" ""I still got a house,"" he adds. ""It's just a little tore up."" A boat on its side after the storm As we are chatting Robert's friend, Craig Hack, 56, appears. He too rode out the storm on a small sailing yacht. ""I just about lost my mast,"" he says, cackling when I ask how it was. ""No brains"" is his answer. Both men say they stayed because they wanted to be with their boat homes and their vehicles. They agreed that many folk like them would have lost money in the storm because they did not have insurance. Here in this coastal town that is a familiar story, of people struggling to make ends mean, let alone to thrive. Rockport was founded as a cattle abattoir and meat-packing port after the American civil war of 1861-1865. Named after its geology - it sits on a solid rock ledge - the town and its adjoining neighbour, Fulton, did well for many years, first on the beef trade and later thanks to fishing and shrimping. The storm flipped this plane over at Aransas County Airport By the time the 20th Century had dawned, a railway was bringing in tourists too. They still come, spending time and money boating and birdwatching, with ornithologists keen to see whooping cranes and hummingbirds. But their money does not seem to have done much for the people of the port or of its wooded suburbs. ""Hardscrabble"" is the word Americans use to describe a place like Rockport. It is overwhelmingly white (88.7% at the last census in 2010) andvoted decisively for Donald Trump,externalin the 2016 presidential election. Life here is tough, says Judie, never more so than now. There is some good news though. Judie thinks that Dan, the missing man, got out with relatives or friends just before the storm. ""God was with us,"" she says of her own survival though as she glances around at the destruction, she sounds a little unsure. Judie stayed, she tells me, because she had no means to leave and no place to go. ""I had some problems getting out of town, a little broke and stuff, so I had to come home and, you know, tough it out,"" she says. ""We're all the working class people. ""We're the ones who go to the restaurants and wait on you and pick up your trash and do all that work. We don't have a lot of money."" ""Fighting for the American dream,"" she adds, with a rueful laugh. US storm to bring 'catastrophic' flooding In pictures: Texas battered 'I'm basically homeless' after Harvey.

"'Comical, exciting and sickeningly transparent'","Conor McGregor's first words at his post-fight news conference drew focus on his own branded whiskey. It was another sell at the end of arguably the greatest sell in boxing history. Former five-weight world champion Floyd Mayweather stopped the Irish UFC fighter, who was making his boxing debut, in the 10th round after one of the most hyped fights of all time. Beforehand, the media pored over every word - racist, homophobic or otherwise. Boxing purists despaired, while the MMA community dreamed their relatively young sport would topple the more established form of combat. Journalists literally pushed and shoved one another for position at media events. Photographers charged towards the fighters as if they were the Beatles reunited. It was comical, exciting and at times sickeningly transparent in its core purpose - to make as much money as possible. Podcast: 'It was called a circus - it was a real fight' McGregor rues 'early stoppage' Mayweather chose right 'dance partner' for final fight Mayweather stops McGregor to win Vegas super-fight The figures will be staggering. An hour after picking apart a tiring McGregor, Mayweather said the bout had surpassed the $72.2m (Â£59.9m) earned at the gate when heovercame Manny Pacquiaoin 2015. Pay-per-view figures will be firmed up next week but bank on the total exceeding $620m (Â£480m), roughly what Mayweather-Pacquiao delivered. Probably the richest bout in history then. Mayweather hopes to pick up $300m (Â£232m) - he was making almost $10m (Â£7.7m) a minute. Did he earn it? Yes, the 40-year-old grafted in promoting the fight but when laid bare, the contest was always his. ""Floyd didn't look concerned one bit,"" said Britain's former undisputed heavyweight champion Lennox Lewis. ""He was smiling, very comfortable, composed. I didn't see the point of the whole thing. I didn't think [McGregor] did well at all."" This video can not be played I would rather have been knocked out - McGregor Punch stats - though at times debatable - show McGregor landed nine more than the victor for six rounds. The next four rounds saw Mayweather throw 70 more than his rival. That is some acceleration in pace, arguably all too easy. Respected boxing writer Tris Dixon commented: ""McGregor won what Mayweather let him win."" It sounds brutally harsh. No-one can deny McGregor's guts or his will to break new ground. He is a credit to UFC but about 5,000 spare seats at the T-Mobile Arena indicates some saw him as part of an overhyped, expensive and flawed product. Former super-middleweight champion Carl Froch said if McGregor were an established boxer, the term ""outclassed"" would be used. ""What was it people bought into?"" said boxing promoter Frank Warren. Personality and intrigue undoubtedly. McGregor is not an established boxer and his efforts in the ring were honest. But when the dust settles, the intricacies of the fight are analysed and the behaviour of all involved in the build-up is dissected, the legacy may be a rather hollow feeling. McGregor will make do with around $100m (Â£77.5m) - roughly $3m (Â£2.3m) a minute. In the ring, he paid for not having Mayweather's 21 years of pure-boxing conditioning. ""Questions or shall I prattle on?"" he said on hitting the stage afterwards. The world outside of UFC has learned he needs no invitation. But from now on, he will have invitations aplenty. Mayweather might have out-earned him but 'The Notorious' brand has gone stratospheric in recent weeks. And hence this boxing gamble will pay dividends. New brands will want a slice of him; those who already own a slice will look to protect it. Mayweather and McGregor embrace at the post-fight news conference Asked about McGregor boxing again, UFC president Dana White answered emphatically: ""I would rather he did not. I don't think there is anything left to prove."" McGregor - sporting sunglasses and a colourful suit - ruled nothing out, including a trilogy fight in the UFC with Nate Diaz, or more boxing. ""Conor McGregor is now a huge attraction in boxing,"" said BBC Radio 5 live commentator Mike Costello. ""You've seen the sparring videos and their fall-out, so now Conor McGregor v Paulie Malignaggi on St Patrick's Day next March is a legitimate fight. The build-up for that starts now."" If he doesn't fancy more boxing, McGregor has the microphone skills for WWE - as well as an energy and swagger which some say points to Hollywood. Referee Robert Byrd stops the fight one minute and five seconds into round 10 Refreshingly, he was reflective afterwards. Just as he was after his biggest UFC defeat to date against Diaz last year. True champions quickly find solutions and he promised to address a lull in energy he believes he feels midway through his MMA fights and says affected him here. Hearing him speak about his craft in this mood is intoxicating. He does not pay lip service; rather, every word he utters has clearly come from deep thought. This studious nature combined with gripping personality mean that with Mayweather retired, he is the biggest name in combat sports. ""I have many options in MMA and I'm sure there will be options that present themselves in the boxing ring,"" said the 29-year-old. ""I am open. I love competing. Tonight was a damn good fight. I enjoyed myself and I can't tell you exactly what is next."" Who knows? But it will be big. McGregor did his share to hype this bout in pursuit of more money than he will ever need. Just don't bank on him quietly disappearing with his earnings. To watch Mayweather is to see a man practically box on autopilot. Those decades spent honing his craft meant even at 40, the American - who had been retired for almost two years - was a force. Afterwards, he made no attempt to hide his motivation. ""I have retired before but I'm not a damn fool,"" he said. ""If I see an opportunity to make $300m in 36 minutes I will. But this is my last one."" Who wouldn't do the same? And in his defence, amid the hype of recent weeks he was the quieter man. Often his barbs felt forced, delivered because he could not be seen to say nothing as McGregor's antics reached new heights. But he pushed for this fight, floating it to UFC bosses by his own admission. This win showed his quality to a new audience - those sucked in by the anarchy. Perhaps that is a positive - more people have seen his genius. Mayweather was up on all three cards when the fight was stopped And 1950s world heavyweight champion Rocky Marciano's perfect 49-fight record has been surpassed. Hence as it ends - again - Mayweather's career should be lauded. Making it to the top was not easy. He spoke of his first $100,000 cheque - received at the age of 19. ""I came from poverty,"" he pointed out. ""I wasn't listening at that meeting, I just wanted that cheque."" To reach a point where he has now taken part in the two richest fights in history and banked hundreds of millions of dollars shows genius from a business perspective too. ""I look forward to becoming a boxing trainer, helping fighters,"" he said. ""I want to teach fighters about becoming a superstar not just in the ring but outside. It takes a lot of work on the outside to become a megastar."" Mayweather took his perfect career record to 50-0 He is a megastar and boxing has lost its marquee name again. Perhaps this fight illustrates just how hard it will be to find a replacement. If candidates were plentiful, it would never have happened in the first place. Boxing purists have their fancied names but the casual fan wants something simple, something they don't have to work to understand amidst the myriad of belts and weight classes. This bout gave them that and the opportunist in Mayweather pounced. Inside and outside the ring, that opportunistic nature was key for possibly the greatest the game has seen.

Game of Thrones: Who is the true heir?,"Westeros and Great Britain may have more in common than you think The seventh season of fantasy TV drama Game of Thrones has hurtled to a close, and the burning question for fans right now is: ""Who will inherit the Iron Throne?"" The world of Westeros may be fictional, but its origins are far from imaginary. ""Medieval Britain has played an enormous impact on the series,"" creator George RR Martinonce said,external. What better way to determine the true ruler of the Seven Kingdoms than by using the rules that govern the British monarchy? Who will win the Game of Thrones? We've compiled a list of contenders for the coveted Iron Throne (the seat of the kingdom's monarchy) and enlisted royal commentatorRichard Fitzwilliams,externaland medieval academics professorSarah Peverley,externaland DrGordon McKelvie,externalto weigh in on each candidate's chances. What do fans think will happen? Game of Thrones in numbers Cast emotional as they head for finale Follow the BBC's Game of Thrones coveragehere Cersei and Queen Margaret have quite a lot in common Born and bred in Westeros, Cersei is a devoted mother who married into royalty. Her late husband Robert Baratheon led a bloody rebellion and overthrew the ruling Targaryen dynasty. Her children came from an incestuous relationship with her brother Jamie (both their sons became young kings). While plotting the deaths of her rivals, Cersei lost her three children but ascended to the throne. Incest has always been taboo - the Lannisters' incestuous relationship would be frowned upon Richard Fitzwilliams:In Britain, an heir is determined by descent and parliamentary statute. Succession is also determined by the sequence of royal family members. Cersei declared herself queen without any legitimacy. Her claim rests on two things: being Robert Baratheon's widow and the mother of two dead kings. She resembles the villainous Margaret of Anjou, queen by marriage to the feeble King Henry VI. Margaret was also ruthless and highly influential. Sarah Peverley:Inheritance in the Seven Kingdoms is based on real medieval laws, often prone to contradictory interpretations. Generally speaking, thelaw of primogeniture,externalseems to govern the Iron Throne, which females can claim in the event of no male heir. Or they can act until a young king comes of age, as Cersei attempted to do. But her current claim rests solely on the power she wields. Gordon McKelvie:There have been plenty of unpopular queens with too much influence and power. Cersei seems to share their qualities. I can't think of any historical example where a king (with no children) dies and passes the crown to his mother. No one in medieval England made such a dramatic grab for power like Cersei did. Her desire for the Iron Throne is well known, but is the dragon queen entitled to it? The dragon queen's journey has been impressive, starting out as the timid daughter of Aerys Targaryen, the ""Mad King"" who was overthrown by Robert Baratheon. She went on to become an assertive ruler with a formidable army and dragons. Her ambition earned her the loyalty of many aides and allies. She fought to abolish slavery and now has her sights set on the Iron Throne, where she plans to end the vicious cycle of power politics. Like any monarch, Daenerys isn't short of titles. ""First of Her Name"" and ""Queen of the Andals"" are some names she goes by. Will she be able to avenge her family's name? Game of Thrones was inspired by the Wars of the Roses, a civil war that wreaked great havoc in England Richard Fitzwilliams:The Targaryens were the rightful rulers of Westeros before their dynasty was usurped. In this respect, Daenerys's claims certainly have validity, being in exile would not alter this. For centuries, monarchy has favoured the precedence of males over females. In 2015, an act known asSuccession to the Crown Billcame into force and this meant the eldest living child of a monarch succeeds, regardless of sex. This would have been good news for Daenerys, were it not for the fact her deceased older brother had a legitimate son.(Editor's note:Latest events have shown Jon Snow is the son of Rhaegar Targaryen and Lyanna Stark.,external) Daenerys has the support of her dragon children. The dragon we have in the UK rests on the Welsh flag, first used by Henry Tudor at the 1485 Battle of Bosworth which saw the defeat of Richard III and ended the Wars of the Roses. The flag of Wales: Parallels with House Targaryen? Sarah Peverley:Any house that previously ruled can make a relevant claim to the Iron Throne. However, the problem in Westeros is that nobody follows pre-determined laws. Daenerys's ancestor Aegon I was a conqueror. In turn, his descendants were overthrown during a rebellion incited by Robert Baratheon. If we apply these precedents, anyone able to conquer lands and hold them possesses the right to rule. In Daenerys's case, she has a legitimate ancestral claim. She also has an army, dragons and is beloved by those she liberates. This combination gives her a superior claim over others as she has the interests of the people at heart, rather than her own ambitions. Will military assets and dragons win the hearts of the common people? Gordon McKelvie:She is the last Targaryen, or at least she thinks she is. This means a Targaryen restoration was an option, though not necessarily a popular one. It was important for any monarch to be popular with their nobility as the crown needs to have people willing to fight for it in times of war. Lord Randyll Tarly's dislike for Daenerys as a foreign invader was a sentiment that would be shared by many throughout British history. Like any respected ruler, Jon Snow has led troops onto the field and fought with them in battle Now a celebrated Northern leader, Jon Snow has come a long way from being outcast as Ned Stark's bastard child. Illegitimate no more, he is the son of Rhaegar Targaryen (Daenerys's brother), rightful heir to the Iron Throne. The prince legally wed Jon's mother Lyanna Stark in a secret ceremony(Editor's note: All this he does not know yet). Blood from two of Westeros's most powerful houses signals one of the strongest claims to the throne. But would the monarchy have favoured this revelation? Many rooting for Jon think he will make an excellent (but reluctant) Westeros king Richard Fitzwilliams:As his father was Rhaegar, Jon obviously has a very strong claim. He is more entitled to the throne than Daenerys. Sarah Peverley:Being labelled the ""rightful heir"" isn't quite as clear-cut as it sounds. The Targaryens were a dynasty that ruled by right of conquest. So did the Baratheons. As Daenerys believes she is the only living Targaryen heir, we can't know for sure how she would respond to Jon's lineage. It is entirely possible that she would follow ""tradition"" and defer to him, following the lines of primogeniture. Gordon McKelvie:Now that Jon is indeed Rhaegar's legitimate son, this puts him second in line to the throne. After his father was killed in battle, Jon can be considered the next heir. Did monarchy laws overlook royal bastards like fan-favourite Gendry? Could Robert's last surviving son give others on our list a good fight? Young Gendry made his appearance as the late king's bastard child. With Baratheon blood running through his veins, fans are rooting for the talented blacksmith to uphold one of Westeros's last great houses. But is he entitled to? Richard Fitzwilliams:Compared to others on this list, Gendry won't stand a great chance. But the unexpected often happens: William the Conqueror was born a bastard but took the throne by force at the Battle of Hastings in 1066. He defeated King Harold and became King of England. Like Gendry, William the Conqueror was born out of wedlock Sarah Peverley:Gendry was born out of wedlock so this makes his claim weaker than Daenerys (and possibly Jon). As a medieval rule, bastards could not inherit, especially if legitimate heirs existed. Gordon McKelvie:Gendry is a great character but the law made it unlikely he would ever become king. In England, being a bastard was always a problem so it was unlikely Gendry would fare well against a pure-blooded candidate like Daenerys. King Henry I had 24 bastard children. Some royal bastards ended up in positions of wealth and influence. Perhaps this is Gendry's fate? Treachery and deceit defined the ambitious Little Finger Here was a candidate with no royal lineage but made his desire to rule strongly known. The low-born Petyr Baelish (nicknamed Little Finger) worked his way into prominence and eventually landed in the late King Robert's court. He was a skilled manipulator, known to have played out key allies. Baelish's story was said to mirror that of Thomas Cromwell, who served as royal chief minister from 1532 to 1540. But his cunning plans soon caught up with him and now he's paid the price with his life. His story was said to have been inspired by English statesman Thomas Cromwell Richard Fitzwilliams:His chances were nil. He had no royal blood or charisma. Petyr Baelish could have risen high but it's a dangerous place to be, as Cromwell, who was later executed by King Henry VIII, eventually found. Britain is the last European country to have coronation ceremonies with imposing religious rituals. These have remained remarkably similar over the centuries. Crowning yourself would bear no legitimacy, even during the most turbulent times in history. But Baelish's schemes amounted to nothing in the end. Like Cromwell, he was executed Sarah Peverley:Little Finger could use his status to style himself as a ""man of the people"". If he gained the support of a significant number of lords, there was nothing to prevent him from trying to attain the crown. He could read others well and he made people do his bidding so he'd probably have made a very strong ruler. Gordon McKelvie:As much as I enjoy watching Petyr Baelish's schemes, it would not have worked in medieval Britain. He was similar to many unpopular courtiers, who were seen as exerting more power and influence than they deserved. When a king was replaced, it was always by someone who descended from an earlier king. So my answer for Little Finger's royal ambitions: they simply were not possible.

The city of shining towers and bulldozed slums," A thick layer of acrid, blue smoke hovers just above the waterfront slums that skirt Lagos lagoon, filtering out sunrise and sunset. This man-made mist that clings to the rusted shack rooftops comes from the countless fish-smoking cabins that drive the slum economy. There’s an uninterrupted view of the city’s dramatic sprawl of poverty from the road bridges that carry daily commuters between the islands and the mainland. Fishing and sand-dredging boats drift to work, heading deep into the lagoon. Many of the slums’ wooden huts are on stilts, others are just basic shacks shoddily built on the unstable ground of trodden-down rubbish dumps. Nobody knows exactly how many people live in Lagos, but they all agree on one thing – Nigeria's biggest city is growing at a terrifying rate. The UN says 14 million. The Lagos State government thinks it’s nearer 21 million, as rural Nigerians are drawn by the hope of a better life to one of Africa’s few mega-cities. By 2050 Nigeria will have twice the population it has today, more than half will live in cities, and about 60% of them will be under 25. In an overcrowded neighbourhood on mainland Lagos, Muktar Abdulhamid, 36, is pressing shirts with a heavy, old-fashioned iron filled with charcoals. Abdulhamid is from a rural village in the northern state of Kano, and he’s left his wife and one-year-old child at home and come here to try to make money. Muktar Abdulhamid: Just one of many rural Nigerians drawn to Lagos “This isn’t what I intended to be doing. I want to do business – to buy and sell,” he says. “It’s not easy to leave your wife, your child, it’s lonely, but I have no choice – it’s for the future of the family.” There are few good jobs and housing is in high demand, but at least there are opportunities. Every week tens of thousands of people arrive in Lagos, heading to neighbourhoods where friends and relatives have come before – many end up in the slums. But Lagos State is planning tower blocks and transformation, reclaiming land from the sea for ambitious new developments. In a rush to transform the city, the waterfront slums are being cleared, court rulings are being ignored, and luxury apartment blocks are springing up. Can Lagos persuade wealthy investors to buy into a futuristic vision, while helping pull the poorest people out of poverty? In about 30 years Nigeria will overtake the US to become the world’s third most populated country behind China and India. It vies with South Africa for the status of the continent’s biggest economy, but it’s now in recession - beset by a drop in oil prices, and having to fund the fight against both Boko Haram Islamists and separatists targeting oil pipelines in the Niger Delta. Like everywhere else in Africa trying to break out of poverty, Nigeria hopes fast population growth will bring it a “demographic dividend” – a young workforce that can drive economic growth. If they can all be put to work. Already there’s migration north to Libya and on to Europe, and the young who are left idle and without much hope are easily radicalised by Boko Haram. It’s going to take great management, smart politics and increasing security and stability to turn rapid population growth into a positive and avoid the potential for disaster. Source: Google/ Landsat / Copernicus “Africa’s Model Megacity” flashes up in the glitzy video of beautiful sunsets and impressive artists' impressions of the big Lagos city development plan. Soaring luxury skyscrapers sit alongside a port, enterprise parks and a new city-wide transport system of train lines, ferries and bus lanes. But in the waterfront slums circling the lagoon, this vision is a threat to livelihoods, not a hope for the future. Elebiomayo Folashade was a relatively well-off woman living in a sand-slum – but now she’s angry. Pulling up her elegant blue dress, she leans down to inspect the damage done to one of her boats by security forces, and begins to cry. “They destroyed my boats and my husband’s boats and now I cannot pay the school fees, so the children have been withdrawn from school,” she says. “I am old – what am I going to do now?” Many boats with huge holes in their hulls have been hauled up and abandoned on a beach that just a year ago was busy with work. Ebute Ilaje is a place that has lived off sand-dredging for decades. Wooden boats with food-sack sails would bring sand from deep in the lagoon to sell as building material, employing thousands of people. But then the government “taskforce” came – smashing holes in their boats and threatening to burn down the slum if they continued to work. Now Folashade’s livelihood has gone – as has that of many in a community that depended on the sand-dredgers to keep the economy afloat. Many believe what’s labelled a security crackdown against crime is an excuse to drive them out. “The state government is interested in the land in all these waterfront communities... so the rich can benefit from it,” says former dredger Oladipupo Aireomiye. His fears stem from the recent clearance of Otodo Gbame slum, which went ahead despite a court order halting its destruction. Otodo Gbame, after the bulldozers went in The bulldozers came in with the taskforce, smashing tin shacks, burning anything wooden to the ground. “The police seized our documents and fired tear gas… some people fled, others were shot,” says Maxwell Hunga, who lived in Otodo Gbame. The moment you demolish a slum, naturally two or three more slums will spring up because people need somewhere to sleep “The most challenging thing we are facing is the threat of eviction that is hanging around the community’s neck,” says Samuel Akinrolabu from the Nigerian Slum and Informal Settlement Federation. “Over 40 communities are under the threat of eviction and 300,000 people would be rendered homeless eventually if this action is carried out,” he says. “But forced eviction will not make slums disappear. Rather the moment you demolish a slum, naturally two or three more slums will spring up because people need somewhere to sleep."" Klote Kakini, fisherman They have the same fears in Ago Egun, the next slum along, where the men catch fish and the women smoke them on circular wire grills. Their shacks are built on a floating rubbish dump - trodden down and compacted over the years, its paths wobble disconcertingly underfoot. Klote Kakini is an old fisherman whose father lived here before him. He is worried his family will be evicted while he’s in the boat. “When we leave to catch fish, we are afraid something will happen to our wives and children at home,” he says. “Maybe the government will send agents to demolish everything or scatter our families.” But Steve Ayorinde, the Lagos State and governor’s spokesman, says these fears are unfounded: “This is a government with a human face, this is a government that won’t just descend on helpless citizens and just bulldoze them away.” He denies they have been heavy-handed by driving people from land they have lived on for many years. “I’m not aware that there has been any community that has been living within the waterfront for generations. It’s always a convenient lie for people to tell just to demonise the government,” he says. “All over the world there will always be the need for regeneration of certain areas. It’s happened in New York, in London... and Lagos is not an exception.” He gives two examples where people were resettled and compensation was paid. “Of course at some point there will be mild resistance, but this government believes in dialogue – in engaging with people so they can see the bigger picture of what the benefits would be.” But Samuel Akinrolabu describes a different reality: “The basic reason is land-grabbing, to be honest. Lagos government has seen that the waterfront communities are prime land where they can build the five-star hotels... and people can wake up and see the ocean view.” He believes the answer to redevelopment is to leave people where they are, improve their lives in situ and create new space to house them. ""We are in an urban age and people are going to keep coming, so we are just going to have to find more creative ways to accommodate more people,” says Taibat Lawanson, associate professor of urban and regional planning at the University of Lagos. And they do keep coming - from other towns and cities, and from remote rural communities. Lagos has become Nigeria’s centre of gravity. Lagos is crowded, chaotic, and crumbling. In the slums of the old city the spirits of the dead appear to have returned to cleanse it of evil and pray for its peace and prosperity. The tall men, wrapped in white, jump and crouch, sweeping their long sticks at the crowd. Their heads are veiled and topped with brightly coloured hats, as they spin through the streets towards the palace of their “Oba” – the king of Lagos. The Eyo Festival (pronounced Ay-oh) usually marks the death of the city’s most important or influential people, but this ceremony – the first in seven years – is celebrating the 50th anniversary of Lagos State. The original spot where 15th Century Yoruba fishermen settled on Lagos Island is now an edgy, poor, densely packed neighbourhood. Degraded buildings lean into each other, appearing to sag under the weight of people packing the balconies to watch the procession. The roads are potholed, there are few schools or clinics, let alone parks or playing fields – it desperately needs a new lease of life. Lateef Shelobo, Lagos State Urban Renewal Agency “Lagos has no choice but to go up,” says Lateef Sholebo, head of Lagos State Urban Renewal Agency. “How are we going to accommodate all the population? There is no way we can continue to sprawl.”After 25 years as a city planner in Los Angeles, he has now returned home to put into practice the lessons of urban renewal he has learned. Emerging from the rusty tin rooftops and towering above the Eyo parade route is a multi-storey apartment block – a gleaming, modern show home rising from the slum. “This project is very important because it shows the people in the community how a slum area can be transformed from what it used to be to a more modern, more sustainable environment,” he says, enthusiastically. Eleven families lived on the land – they were persuaded to combine their plots and stay elsewhere while the 48-flat tower block was built. Now they have 11 modern apartments to move into – and 37 extra new homes for their neighbours. “The air-space is useless – nobody is using it. Now we are able to go vertical we can reduce the overcrowding,” says Sholebo. “If we are able to convince all the rest of the families to participate in this kind of programme I think it’s better for them, it’s better for the government – and it’s better for everybody.” But it took years to build and was hugely expensive - too expensive for the government to roll out across Lagos. The city needs to be rebuilt without moving whole communities out. That’s where Sholebo’s American experience could make the difference – using imaginative tax tricks to generate finance for the infrastructure to bring in private developers. “We have to come up with different ways, or creative ways to provide such affordable housing,” says Sholebo. But those with the money to invest are looking for better returns elsewhere. Landmark Towers From the 11th-storey penthouse of the luxury Landmark Towers there’s an amazing view of the ocean and the sprawling waterfront developments. “We are trying to create West Africa’s first one-stop shop, live, work and play destination,” explains property developer Paul Onwuanibe. The Landmark Group chief executive lives in the penthouse suite, and from the large, open terrace points out what will go where on the five-hectare, $100m development. There’s already a Hard Rock Cafe, a fine dining restaurant, and an events centre which seats 4,000 people – hugely popular for expensive weddings. Land has been cleared for a Marriott hotel, a small shopping mall, an IMAX cinema, two office blocks and two apartment buildings. Here, people can avoid the Lagos chaos of overcrowding and terrible traffic congestion – the selling point is that if you can afford to live here, you never need to leave. Onwuanibe’s five hectares are dwarfed by the massive Eko Atlantic project next door. The Eko Atlantic development Earthmovers are landscaping this vast spur of land reclaimed from the sea, roads are being built and the first few tower blocks are beginning to take shape. It’s a stark contrast from life in the slums – a symbol of the vast inequality in Lagos. “There will always remain the super-rich and there will always remain the people just simply below the poverty line, but the hope is that over the next few years you will see that gap bridged as more people get more jobs,” says Onwuanibe. “I believe in trickle-down economics – so that wealth you create actually goes through the system, so the very people that feel that they’re displaced end up getting helped.” Rural Yanoko is a long way from the sprawl and chaos of Lagos. Most women in this village have about seven children. That’s typical for the surrounding region - the countryside overlapping northern Nigeria and southern Niger. It's the area with the highest birth rate in the world. And this birth rate is helping put Nigeria well on its way to becoming the world’s third-largest country by 2050. More than half of women are married before they are 15 and having many children is considered a sign of good fortune – and they are a good source of farm labour. There’s a huge push to reduce the fertility rate, but the population here is expected to triple in the next 30 years. There’s little for people to do, and lack of opportunity drives them to the city. Muktar Abdulhamid has optimism written across his chest. The 36-year-old wears a bright Superman T-shirt while very precisely ironing shirts in the overcrowded Lagos mainland neighbourhood of Agege. It wasn’t what he intended to do when came here from Yanoko, but well-paying work is rare and it helps him get by while waiting for that big business opportunity to come along. “When I arrived I thought it would be easy, but then I realised how much harder it was to get work, but you can’t just sit here without a job,” says Muktar. “I want to buy and sell, to have a shop in Kano and make enough money to go back to school to get a Western education.” Many people in this particular Lagos neighbourhood are from northern Nigeria and speak the same language, and so it feels a little more like home. But he misses the wife and young son he left behind nine months ago when he came to make it in the big city. Back home in Yanoko it’s the rainy season - and bright green fields jump out from the stark background of burnt orange mud buildings. There are only six cars, electricity is something they had for about a week before the new power lines fell dormant, and since the only bridge collapsed four years ago, it’s been even harder to reach the nearest health centre 27km away. Seven thousand people live here - a two-hour ride on a rocky road from Kano, which is the biggest city in northern Nigeria. Muktar Abdulhamid’s family are sitting together to talk about the man who left it all to make his fortune in the city. “We don’t have money to eat, so we had to send the boy to go look for money,” says his sister Ramatu Abdulkarim. “He is getting a little bit every day, just enough to survive, thank God. Sometimes he sends us 40, 50, or 60,000 Naira,” Muktar’s sister says. That’s between $110 and $165 (£85-£125), equivalent to two months’ worth of the annual income the family makes from farming maize, rice, soya or chillies. “We use the money for the farm and for buying food and clothing for the children – he also sent money for [his wife] Ramatu. “She’s not comfortable that he’s not close to her. And he’s not happy that he’s far from her.” Ramatu Muktar, 22, nods in agreement as one-year-old Abdulhamid plays on the floor – the whole family are praying Muktar will do well and take them both to Lagos to be with him. She’s shy and says little, but Muktar’s good friend and cousin Saidu Yahaya says it’s all about having money – to improve life and plan for the unexpected. “They are making money there, but you know how things are, it’s meagre money. You have to manage the little you have for survival,” says Saidu. About 150 young men from Yanoko are also trying to get work in Lagos – and the road to town is only going to get busier. “Lagos has always had that mixed blessing of having to deal with an influx of people. Unfortunately for us in the last two or three years it has been a deluge,” says the Lagos State and Governor’s spokesman Steve Ayorinde. He says 27 or 28 of the 36 states in Nigeria are struggling to pay local government salaries and it’s harder for people to migrate abroad. “We want other people to be here – to bring ideas, to bring values, to bring innovation, but we’re just unable to deal with it endlessly,” he says. “The prosperity of Lagos, in a way, is also tied to how open it is... so visitors will always have a great role to play in Lagos if they play by the rules.” More than half the population in Lagos is already under 25, and if there was work for them to do, and the birth rate was to slow down, the economy would get a welcome boost. This is where the “demographic dividend” comes in - an opportunity to take advantage of a big and active workforce. But if enough jobs aren’t created, the country suffers from the other side of that coin. Too many unemployed young people provides a fertile recruiting ground for Islamists like Boko Haram or a market for the people-smugglers peddling dreams of wealth and a better life in Europe. So if Africa's biggest challenge is everyone's problem, what's the solution? The newly-trained staff in the glossy new Lagos factory are carefully packing phones into boxes. As production lines go it's small, but for “the first indigenous mobile, tablet, phone and computer assembly plant in Nigeria”, at least it's a start. The company, Afrione, wants to tap into the big market for devices that a fast-growing young population provides, by producing cheap phones and tablets with the tagline “Made in Nigeria”. At the moment at least 90% of the components are imported, but company director Lekan Akinjide wants to steadily decrease that by 4 or 5% a year. “What we are actually doing fundamentally is starting the process - no-one else has really tried, no one else has really invested in a factory and the training of a skilled workforce,” he says. “We've looked at China, we've looked at India, we've also looked at what people have done here and tried not to make the mistakes they have made.” China had a fast growing population. It had deep and pervasive poverty, it was a rural economy and it turned itself around in a generation, mainly through manufacturing. But the window of time to take advantage of the “demographic dividend” is short – lots of jobs are needed now – and it’s perhaps worth looking a little closer to home. There are some places in Africa where a new industrial revolution is seen as the key to putting the idle youth to work and cashing in on a growing population. Ethiopia’s economy is dwarfed by that of Nigeria, but it’s the continent’s fastest growing and is betting it all on massive infrastructure investment and an industrial revolution to transform a nation of farmers into makers. There are beautiful new six-lane highways, an electric railway line to the ocean, and vast estates of social housing are being built with government-run mortgage schemes to get the poor on the housing ladder. And Nigeria knows massive investment in infrastructure is the answer to a growing economy and to get a congested city moving. The population is even outgrowing the supply of electricity. Generators which fill the gaps are a constant background soundtrack to the city. Taibat Lawanson, planning expert Stage one of Nigeria’s first electric railway line - through Lagos - is almost finished, but it can’t start moving a quarter of a million people a day from the suburbs to the city until its own power station is up and running. “There’s a lot of new infrastructure being built, but it’s skewed and the effects are not felt by the common man,” says planning expert Taibat Lawanson. “There’s a gap between the rich and the poor.” She believes by just improving transport links between residential suburbs and downtown, the government is missing the point – new satellite cities have to be planned and built so people can work near their homes and avoid commuting. “The government has got to understand that people are going to keep coming. “The current thinking is that they need to reverse urbanisation and get people to go back to the villages and stay away, but that’s not going to work.” The luxury waterfront developer Paul Onwuanibe says inequality is everywhere, but he believes it's “a little more acute, or visible” in Lagos. “That’s just part and parcel of mega-cities, but one of the things the government would have to think of is some kind of social platform... some sort of welfare platform that catches people below a certain safety net. “As this country and this city develops, you will see the gap bridged to some extent. “There will be a lot of people that will always remain under the poverty line just because of the sheer numbers,” he says, but believes the trickle-down from a growing economy and better private sector will see more people better off. So what does Steve Ayorinde, the Lagos Governor and State spokesman, think the city will look like in 50 years? “The pride of the black race,” he answers quickly. “Where technology will drive practically everything.” He talks about making Lagos a “smart city” - but millions of people living in slums just want better education and health, somewhere to live and somewhere to work. “Just build modern houses for us - we are happy with where we are living,” says Moses Sangoloke, a long-time resident of the threatened Ago Egun fishing slum, who chairs the community development association. The government knows it needs to build. The people will keep coming. Lagos will keep growing. Built with Shorthand"
