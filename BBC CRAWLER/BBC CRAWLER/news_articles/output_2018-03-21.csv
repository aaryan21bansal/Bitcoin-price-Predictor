"New Look to axe 1,000 jobs and 60 stores","New Look will close 60 UK stores and cut 1,000 jobs after creditors approved a restructuring plan for the retailer. The stores will close within 12 months and some staff may be redeployed. The turnaround plan will cut the fashion chain's rents by between 15% to 55% across its remaining 393 stores. Executive chairman Alistair McGeorge said it was a ""tough decision"" to seek a company voluntary arrangement (CVA) but was necessary to restore the chain to profitability. ""It is clear we need to reduce our fixed cost base. We are therefore pleased to have gained the support of our creditors to address our over-rented store estate,"" he said. ""The CVA is one of a number of necessary actions we are taking to get the company back on track."" The outcome of today's meeting was never in much doubt. Landlords aren't happy, but felt they had little alternative to agree. New Look says it was paying over the odds on many of its stores. But landlords feel they're the ones having to take a huge financial hit because of management failures. It will be interesting to see how many will now use the break clauses allowed as part of this CVA to bring in new tenants willing to pay more rent. One landlord I spoke to has already received expressions of interest. Today's move will buy New Look some crucial breathing space but is it just a sticking plaster for a business that's facing a toxic mix of problems. The restructuring is part of Mr McGeorge's strategy to reduce costs and refocus the brand on its core 25 to 45-year-old customers. New Look is just the latest High Street brand facing a survival-of-the-fittest battle with rising costs and consumer spending that has been squeezed by inflation and stagnant wages. On top of that New Look overstretched itself with nearly 600 stores across the UK, an unsustainable weight of debt, and a faltering strategy to attract younger consumers. Six reasons behind the High Street crisis Moss Bros plunges on profit warning Restaurant chains feel the heat Mr McGeorge, who ran New Look between 2012 and 2014, was brought back in November as the firm's sales tumbled. He cancelled a plan to move the company's headquarters to Kings Cross and decided it should change tack. Rather than stocking items aimed at younger, more fashion-conscious consumers, he thought it should refocus on selling cheaper, ""back-to-basic"" items with broader appeal. But New Look's biggest problem will remain the ""obscene"" number of shops its still runs with the associated costs, says Charlotte Pearce, analyst at Globaldata. ""A 10% cut isn't enough,"" she says. ""I don't know any other retailer that has such a huge store base."" When Mr McGeorge left New Look in 2014 the brand had 2.6% of the UK clothing market. Since then its fallen to below 2%. An agreement from landlords to renegotiate rents is a start. ""It's a step in the right direction. It just doesn't go far enough,"" Ms Pearce says. ""They need to keep rationalising and cut the store base in the long run. That's how retail is going. It's about getting the right stores in the right locations."" Founded 1969 with first store in Taunton, Somerset 594 outlets in UK 213 outlets in Europe, China and the rest of Asia Bought by private investment vehicle Brait in 2015. Brait also owns a stake in Iceland and Virgin Active Gym UK like-for-like sales fell 10% in 39 weeks to 23 December 2017 But New Look faces other challenges in the form of rising costs. Richard Lim, at the consultancy Retail Economics says  the fall in the value of sterling, rising wage costs and business rates have contributed to the pressure on retailers. While some online brands successfully attracted younger consumers to their sites, New Look's online sales were sharply lower last year. And on the High Street where they were supposed to hold sway, they faltered. Mr Lim says the obvious comparison is with Primark, which still manages to draw customers into its physical stores without any online presence at all: ""New Look hasn't been able to reach out in the way Primark has, or keep up with the more nimble online retailers like Asos and Boohoo.""

The brain scanner you can move around in,"This video can not be played The brain scanner allows patients to move Scientists in Nottingham have invented a new type of brain scanner that can be worn on the head, allowing patients to move while being scanned. The device records the tiny magnetic fields generated by the brain. The researchers said it could revolutionise brain imaging. Writing inNature,,externalthey showed it could pinpoint the part of the brain responsible for activities like nodding, drinking tea and playing bat and ball. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) has been around for decades, but conventional scanners are large, weighing half a ton. The sensors used to measure the brain's magnetic fields have to be super-cooled to minus 269C. The UK has 10 MEG scanners and their use is largely limited to research. Part of the problem is that subjects have to keep completely still. The wearable MEG uses lightweight quantum sensors mounted in a 3D printed helmet. The sensors work at room temperature and can be placed directly on the scalp, which greatly increases the signal they can pick up. The wearable scanner means that babies, children and people with movement disorders can have their brain activity measured. Matt Brookes, physicist, who leads the study at Nottingham University told me: ""In terms of mapping brain activity, this represents a step change. ""Neuroscientists will be able to envisage a whole new world of experiments where we try to work out what the brain is doing but whilst a person is behaving naturally and moving around."" The UK has 10 of these conventional MEG scanners which weigh half a ton Prof Gareth Barnes, who leads the project at the Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Neuroimaging at University College London, told me: ""For children with epilepsy, this technology will be incredibly beneficial. Doctors can scan them while they are moving around and that's never been done before."" The researchers say that the wearable MEG scanner will also be useful in imaging patients with Parkinson's disease. All MEG has to be done in a special room which is shielded from much of the Earth's magnetic field. The team at Nottingham created special electromagnetic coils, which they mounted on boards surrounding the scanner, to further reduce the effects of the Earth's field around the scanner by a factor of around 50,000. The research was funded by the Wellcome Trust and developed at the Sir Peter Mansfield Imaging Centre in Nottingham.

Pay rise agreed for 1.3 million NHS staff,"Nurses will be among more than one million staff to benefit from the three-year pay increase More than one million NHS staff, including nurses, porters and paramedics, are being offered increases of at least 6.5% over three years - with some getting as much as 29%. The deal has been formally agreed by union leaders and ministers on Wednesday and will cost Â£4.2bn. Staff will now be asked to vote on the deal, with rises backdated to April if they agree by the summer. The deal is tiered with the lowest-paid in each job receiving the biggest rise. The agreement covers all staff on the Agenda for Change contract - about 1.3m across the UK - which is the entire workforce with the exception of doctors, dentists and senior leaders. The agreement is complex. It means that: half will get a 6.5% pay rise over three years the other half will receive rises of between 9% and 29% because they are not at the top of their pay bands the lowest full-time salary - paid to the likes of cleaners, porters and catering staff - will rise by 15% to more than Â£18,000 these groups will get an immediate Â£2,000 rise this year a nurse with one year's experience would see their basic pay rise by 21% over three years, giving them a salary of up to Â£27,400 the deal includes a commitment on both sides to reduce the high rate of sickness absence in the NHS Sara Gorton, lead negotiator for the health unions, said: ""It won't solve every problem in the NHS but it will go a long way towards making dedicated health staff feel more valued, lift flagging morale and help turn the tide on staffing problems."" Danny Mortimer, chief executive of NHS Employers, said ""compromises"" have had to be made but he predicts the deal will make the NHS a ""desirable"" employer once again. NHS workers demand 3.9% pay rise NHS at 70: what are your NHS memories? The unions, which represent staff from all over the UK, have been in talks with English negotiators. The deal will now be put to staff in England with the results of that consultation expected by July. If they agree it will be backdated to April. Twelve health unions have backed the deal, but the GMB has not. GMB national officer Kevin Brandstatter said the deal promised ""jam tomorrow"" and did not do enough to make up for the squeeze on pay since 2010. ""Long-serving, dedicated health service workers have had thousands of pounds swiped from their pay packets since 2010 by the government's cruel and unnecessary pay cap."" It will be up to the devolved governments to decide whether to implement the deal outside England. Scotland has already given its lowest-paid staff bigger rises, so there could be some divergence in how the terms are introduced elsewhere. Want to join the debate? Here's our NHS group - let us know what you think.,external When the unions entered talks, they were asking for 3.9% a year. Under the deal agreed on Wednesday, pay will increase by 3% in the first year, but the future years will see smaller rises. Once you take into account inflation - forecast to be 2.4% in 2018, then 1.8% and 1.9% in the following two years - it is likely the rises will be fairly small in real terms. But what is important - for the unions at least - is that many will get much more. How much depends on where individual staff are on their pay bands. NHS pay is split into nine bands, each with quite broad ranges. Those at the very bottom of their pay bands could get up to 29%. Those close to the top are likely to get in the region of 9%. Tracey Budding will only get 6.5% more over three years as she is at the top of her pay band Tracey Budding works as a senior nurse in a neonatal intensive care unit and is an active member of the Royal College of Nursing. She is at the top of her pay band so will only get the 6.5% minimum. But she is backing the offer. ""It is a good deal,"" she says. ""It recognises the fact we have not been getting the pay rises we should have. ""It makes it easier for nurses to move up the pay bands and that in turn should help attract and retain nurses."" The government first announced it would lift the public-sector1% pay cap in September for police and prison officers,and then followed that with a promise in the Budget that NHS pay would be looked at, lifting the 1% cap a year early. The NHS has been under pressure to retain staff, after it was revealed that one in 10 nurses was leaving the public sector in England every year. The Royal College of Nursing claims average pay for nurses has fallen by more than14% in real terms since 2010. Statistics obtained by the BBC from NHS Digital showed 33,000 nurses walked away in 2017,piling pressure on understaffed hospitals and community services. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the cost of the rise would be covered by the Treasury rather than coming out of the NHS budget. ""The agreement reflects public appreciation for just how much they have done and continue to do,"" he added.

Facebook 'lost sight' of data says insider,"Facebook is under fire from those who say it has not protected its users' data carefully enough A former Facebook employee has told MPs it did not try hard enough to detect when user data was taken or misused by apps built for the site. The tech giant employed Sandy Parakilas in a role focused on data protection and app compliance, in 2011 and 2012. He told the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee Facebook had ""lost sight"" of what had happened to user data once it had left the company. He confirmed it was possible to target ads based on users' political views. For example, an anti-Islamic group such as Britain First could target people with similar opinions, Mr Parakilas told the committee. He also said he had made Facebook executives aware of his concerns at the time. The story so far How to protect your Facebook data Cambridge Analytica academic a 'scapegoat' Mr Parakilas's hearing follow reports thatFacebook user data was allegedly acquired illicitlyand passed to Cambridge Analytica, a data analytics and advertising company, in 2014. The app that acquired this data was developed privately by a Cambridge University researcher, Dr Aleksandr Kogan. Mr Parakilas told the MPs the system through which apps could access data had been ""far outside the boundaries of what should have been allowed"". This video can not be played Dr Aleksandr Kogan says he has been treated ""unfairly"" by Cambridge Analytica and Facebook ""Facebook was allowing developers to access the data of people who hadn't explicitly authorised that,"" he said. Mr Parakilas also suggested that Facebook, keen to grow as quickly as possible, had been willing to take the ""risk"" of allowing ""unvetted"" people to access its data. When asked if Facebook had treated data like a ""Wild West frontier"", by Conservative MP Julian Knight, Mr Parakilas agreed it had. And when Labour MP Julie Elliott asked whether this situation had posed a challenge to democracy, Mr Parakilas agreed, saying it had posed a ""huge challenge"" to democracy.

Cambridge Analytica: Story so far,"This video can not be played Cambridge Analytica: What we know so far It's a sensational story containing allegations of sleaze, psychological manipulation and data misuse that has provoked an internationally furious response. Tech giant Facebook and data analytics firm Cambridge Analytica are at the centre of a dispute over the harvesting and use of personal data - and whether it was used to influence the outcome of the US 2016 presidential election or the UK Brexit referendum. Both firms deny any wrongdoing. The boss of Cambridge Analytica, Alexander Nix, has since been suspended, while Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has been called on by a Commons parliamentary committee to give evidence. Channel 4 News,externalsent an undercover reporter to meet executives from data analytics firm Cambridge Analytica, following reports by the journalist Carole Cadwalladr in theObserver newspaper,external. The firm had been credited with helping Donald Trump to presidential victory. The reporter posed as a Sri Lankan businessman wanting to influence a local election. Cambridge Analytica boss Alexander Nix was apparently filmed giving examples of how his firm could discredit political rivals by arranging various smear campaigns, including setting up encounters with prostitutes and staging situations in which apparent bribery could be caught on camera. This video can not be played Alexander Nix, CEO, Cambridge Analytica: ""These sort of tactics are very effective"" The firm denies all the claims and says the documentary was ""edited and scripted to grossly represent the nature of those conversations"". It claims the conversations were led by the reporters. ""I must emphatically state that Cambridge Analytica does not condone or engage in entrapment, bribes or so-called 'honey traps', and nor does it use untrue material for any purpose,"" said Mr Nix. In 2014 a quiz on Facebook invited users to find out their personality type. It was developed by University of Cambridge academic Aleksandr Kogan (the university has no connections with Cambridge Analytica). As was common with apps and games at that time, it was designed to harvest not only the user data of the person taking part in the quiz, but also the data of their friends. Facebook has since changed the amount of data developers can scrape in this way. Christopher Wylie, who worked with Cambridge Analytica, alleges that because 270,000 people took the quiz, the data of some 50 million users, mainly in the US, was harvested without their explicit consent via their friend networks. Mr Wylie claims the data was sold to Cambridge Analytica, which then used it to psychologically profile people and deliver pro-Trump material to them. Cambridge Analytica denies any of it was used as part of the services it provided to the Trump campaign. The data was gathered using Facebook's infrastructure at that time, and many other developers had taken advantage of it - but the data was not authorised for them to share with others. The other key point is that even the people directly taking part in the personality quiz would have had no idea that they were potentially sharing their data with Donald Trump's election campaign. Facebook say when they learned their rules had been breached, they removed the app and demanded assurances that the information had been deleted. Cambridge Analytica claims that it never used the data, and deleted it when Facebook told it to. Both Facebook and the UK Information Commissioner want to find out whether it was properly destroyed, as Mr Wylie claims it was not. There are calls for Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg to testify before Congress US senators have called on Mark Zuckerberg to testify before Congress about how Facebook will protect users. In the UK, the chairman of a parliamentary committee, Damian Collins,has summoned Mr Zuckerbergto explain the ""catastrophic failure"" to MPs. The head of the European Parliament said it would investigate to see if the data was misused. A spokesman for Prime Minister Theresa May said she was ""very concerned"" about the revelations. Meanwhile, Cambridge Analyticahas suspended its chief executive, Alexander Nix,saying his comments ""do not represent the values or operations of the firm"". And the academic who created the app at the centre of the storm, Dr Aleksandr Kogan, said he has been made ""a scapegoat"". Where is Mark Zuckerberg? Facebook data row academic says he is 'scapegoat' The global reach of Cambridge Analytica There are a few things to be aware of if you want to restrict who has access to your data. Keep an eye on apps, especially those which require you to log in using your Facebook account - they often have a very wide range of permissions and many are specifically designed to pick up your data Use an ad blocker to limit advertising Look at your Facebook security settings and make sure you are aware of what is enabled. Check the individual app settings to see whether you have given them permission to view your friends as well as yourself. You can download a copy of the data Facebook holds on you, although it is not comprehensive. There is a download button at the bottom of the General Account Settings tab. However bear in mind that your data may be less secure sitting on your laptop than it is on Facebook's servers, if your device is hacked. You can of course, simply leave Facebook, but the campaign group Privacy International warns that privacy concerns extend beyond the social network. ""The current focus is on protecting your data being exploited by third parties, but your data is being exploited all the time,"" said a spokeswoman. ""Many apps on your phone will have permission to access location data, your entire phone book and so on. It is just the tip of the iceberg.""

UK quizzed over Cambridge Analytica links,"Theresa May has been challenged to explain alleged Tory links to firms at the centre of a dispute over the harvesting and use of personal data. The SNP's Ian Blackford said SCL, the parent company of Cambridge Analytica, has been run by a chairman of Oxford Conservative Association. He also claimed its founding chairman was a former Tory MP and a director had donated over Â£700,000 to the party. The PM said she was not aware of any current contracts with the firms. Prime Minister's Questions: The verdict We made mistakes, admits Facebook chief Cambridge Analytica: The data firm's global influence The story so far The prime minister's official spokesman later said that three government departments had had contracts with the SCL Group in the past. Political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica is facing questions over whether it used the personal data of millions of Facebook users to sway the outcome of the US 2016 presidential election and the UK Brexit referendum. The company has suspended its CEO, Alexander Nix, who was filmed as part of a Channel 4 investigation giving examples of how the firm could swing elections around the world with underhand tactics such as smear campaigns and honey traps. Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has admitted the company ""made mistakes"" in its dealings with Cambridge Analytica and a ""breach of trust"" had occurred between the social media giant and its users. In a statement,external, he promised to strengthen the way users' data is protected to prevent ""harvesting"". And he said app developers that misused personally identifiable information would be banned from accessing the platform. This video can not be played Blackford: Tory links to Cambridge Analytica go ""on and on"" At Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, Mr Blackford, the SNP's Westminster leader, raised the issue saying links between the Conservative Party and SCL - Strategic Communications Laboratories - the parent company of Cambridge Analytica, ""go on and on"". He told MPs SCL ""has been run by a chairman of Oxford Conservative Association"", and added: ""It's founding chairman was a former Conservative MP - a director appears to have donated over Â£700,000 to the Tory party. ""A former Conservative party treasurer is a shareholder. We know about the links to the Conservative party - they go on and on."" He asked Theresa May to confirm to the Commons ""your government's connections to the company"". Cambridge Analytica: Facebook boss summoned over data claims The PM replied that allegations concerning the two firms were ""clearly very concerning"". ""As far as I'm aware, the government has no current contracts with Cambridge Analytica or with the SCL group,"" she said. ""It's absolutely right that they are properly investigated and the information commissioner is doing exactly that. ""People need to have confidence in how their personal data is being used. I would expect Facebook, Cambridge Analytica and all organisations involved to comply fully with the investigation that's taking place."" Cambridge Analytica's CEO has been suspended after he was filmed giving examples of how the firm could swing elections She added that a bill is being brought forward on data protection that will give tougher powers to the Information Commissioner's Office - which scrutinises the use of the public's private data for political purposes - to ensure organisations comply. Asked whether government departments have had contracts with the SCL group, the prime minister's official spokesman said there had been three. These were a Ministry of Defence data project in 2014-2015 - when there was a Conservative-Lib Dem coalition government - plus a Home Office training project and a Foreign Office communications project in during Gordon Brown's Labour government. A Conservative party spokesman said: ""The Conservative Party has never employed Cambridge Analytica, or its parent company, nor used their services."" Cambridge Analytica, along with Facebook, is under scrutiny following claims by a whistleblower, Christopher Wylie, who worked with Cambridge Analytica, a London-based firm. He alleges it amassed large amounts of data through a personality quiz on Facebook called This is Your Digital Life. He claims that 270,000 people took the quiz, but the data of some 50 million users, mainly in the US, was harvested without their explicit consent via their friend networks. Mr Wylie says that data was sold to Cambridge Analytica, which then used it to psychologically profile people and deliver pro-Trump material to them, with a view to influencing the outcome of the 2016 presidential election.

'Time to delete Facebook',"""It is time. #deletefacebook."" After reports ofCambridge Analytica using Facebook's user informationcame to light, people across social media have begun to urge others to either #DeleteFacebook or #BoycottFacebook in response. One surprising voice has joined this movement - WhatsApp co-founder Brian Acton. Mr Acton left the company in 2017, three years afterFacebook bought WhatsApp for $19bn(Â£11.4bn at the then exchange rates) in 2014. Allow Twitter content?

Archbishop 'ashamed' of Church over abuse,"This video can not be played Justin Welby on what he has learned about the Church in the wake of child sex abuse inquiry The Archbishop of Canterbury has said how ""ashamed"" he is of the Church in the wake of the child sex abuse inquiry. The Most Rev Justin Welby told the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse that it was ""horrifying"" to read the evidence from survivors. ""I have learned to be ashamed again,"" he said. The three-week hearing is looking into the Diocese of Chichester, where dozens of clergy have been accused of abuse. Mr Welby said: ""To read the transcripts, to read the evidence, to meet the survivors, is horrifying to a huge degree, because you see this extraordinary and atrocious willingness to turn a blind eye to things going very seriously wrong and entirely damaging human beings for their whole lifetimes."" Why was the inquiry into historical child sexual abuse set up? Church may have 'conspired to enable child sex abuse' Boy 'abused' by head of Catholic school He added: ""I want to put on record again - I don't know how to express it adequately - how appalled I am and how ashamed I am of the Church for what it did to those who are survivors and are coping with this. ""The apologies are fine, but you have got to find ways of making it different and we have got to do it as soon as possible."" Questioned by counsel to the inquiry, Fiona Scolding QC, the archbishop was asked what he could do to stop the ""abuse of power that we have seen parading through these doors"". Mr Welby said bishops and other members of the clergy were given training, which was ""quite clear"" that if a safeguarding issue was not reported it was a disciplinary matter. ""Nobody can say 'it's not my fault... I've heard about a problem but, oh well, it was someone else's duty to report it',"" Mr Welby said. ""That is not an acceptable human response, let alone a leadership response. ""If you know a child is being abused, not to report it is simply wrong."" He said bishops already have training to help them understand they are not ""God's gift to the church"". Mr Welby said the culture of parish churches needed to change - so that safeguarding failures were as unacceptable as drink-driving. ""We have to get to the culture that if anything is seen as untoward, every regular member of the church, everyone who knows, who is around says 'this isn't right and I'm going to do something about it',"" he said. He also told the inquiry the Church of England's safeguarding powers ""probably needed re-looking at"". The inquiry - set up in 2015 - aims to address institutional failures to protect children in England and Wales and the Church is one of 13 public organisations being scrutinised.

Suspect identified in Texas bombing spree,"This video can not be played Police chief Brian Manley announced the suspect's death to the media Police have named the suspect they say carried out a deadly series of parcel bombs in the Texas city of Austin as Mark Anthony Conditt, 23. He was killed after detonating an explosive as officers approached his car following a chase in Round Rock, north of the Texas state capital. Officials say he lived about 20 miles (30km) from Austin in a shared home. Investigators say with a ""reasonable level of certainty"" there are no more devices to endanger the public. Police told reporters that Conditt - suspected of five blasts that killed two people and injured six others - made a video ""confession"" on his phone. The 25-minute clip was recovered from the handset after he blew himself up on Wednesday as police closed in. ""He does not at all mention anything about terrorism, nor does he mention anything about hate, but instead it is the outcry of a very challenged young man, talking about challenges in his personal life,"" Austin Police Chief Brian Manley told reporters. Before his death Conditt had been criminally charged with one count of unlawful possession and transfer of a destructive device, the US attorney for the Western District of Texas said in a press release on Wednesday. The suspect was pictured dropping off parcel bombs at a FedEx store Conditt lived with two flatmates in Pflugerville, north of Austin, says investigators. The flatmates have been talking to authorities, but were not suspected of any crimes. Authorities said they found several components inside the property that match the devices used in the other attacks. Texas Governor Greg Abbot told Fox News that the suspect had not erased his online footprint, which may provide a ""treasure trove of information that should shed light on who he is, what he did, and why he was doing it"". Austin rattled by days of bomb attacks Conditt attended the Austin Community College from 2010 to 2012, but did not graduate. The BBC has confirmed that this 2013 photo is of Mark Conditt The Austin American-Statesman newspaper reports he was home-schooled by his mother during his high-school years. ""I officially graduated Mark from High School,"" his mother wrote on Facebook in a 2013 post showing her son. ""He's thinking of taking some time to figure out what he wants to do... maybe a [religious] mission trip,"" his mother wrote. The newspaper reports that he had recently worked for Crux Semiconductor in Austin as a ""purchasing Agent/buyer/shipping and receiving"", citing a profile on a job recruiting website. US media have uncovered a 2012 blog which was written under the suspect's name and appeared to be for a university course that he attended. In the blog called Defining my Stance, he purportedly describes beliefs that ""gay marriage should be illegal"", opposition to abortion and why the sex offender registry should be eliminated. In the blog, he defines himself as ""a conservative"". ""But I don't think I have enough information to defend my stance as well as it should be defended,"" he says, adding that he is taking the course ""because I want to understand the US government, and I hope that it will help me clarify my stance"". The Austin police department on Tuesday used footage from a FedEx store in south Austin, the scene of the latest parcel bomb explosion, to identify the suspect. Police found several pieces of evidence to lead to Conditt, including unusual batteries and screws used in each device, according to CBS News. After using the Google search engine to gather information on the suspect's online browsing history, authorities later managed to locate his vehicle. Early on Wednesday, local and federal officers took up positions around a parking area near a hotel in Round Rock. As they waited for tactical teams to arrive, the vehicle started to drive away and officers pursued it. When the vehicle eventually pulled over, armed officers approached, but the suspect then detonated a bomb, injuring one officer. Allow Twitter content?

This video can not be played Texas explosions: What we know about bombings By Gary O'Donoghue, BBC News, Austin This was a dramatic denouement to a three-week reign of terror. It was only in the past 36 hours or so that police really got a handle on the possible identity of the suspect, who had foxed them for weeks by changing the nature of his targets and his method of operation. But the sheer number of devices - six in all - in such a short period of time may have been one factor that eventually led to his pursuit and apparent suicide. Another crucial factor was the one device that didn't go off. That gave police key leads and allowed them to isolate CCTV evidence of the suspect dropping off one of the devices at a FedEx office. As police continue to gather evidence at the scene, motivation will be the question on everyone's lips in Texas. Authorities have said that a series of blasts that began in Austin in early March - involving package bombs and a tripwire - were all related: 2 March:A device explodes at Anthony Stephan House's home in Austin, killing the 39-year-old man 13 March:Draylen William Mason, 17, is killedand his mother is critically injured after he brings a package inside his home from the doorstep in Austin 13 March:Hours later, a 75-year-old Hispanic woman, who has not been named, is injured by another package in the state capital 18 March:A device injures two men who may have set off a tripwire while walking along a street in Austin 20 March:A parcel bomb explodes at a FedEx depot in Schertz, slightly injuring one person.

Cambridge Analytica boss suspended,"This video can not be played Tuesday's broadcast showed Mr Nix saying he met Donald Trump 'many times' Cambridge Analytica, the firm involved in a row over its use of Facebook data, has suspended its boss Alexander Nix. The chief executive's comments,secretly recorded by Channel 4 News,external, ""do not represent the values or operations of the firm,"" it said. In the footage, Mr Nix appeared to suggest tactics his company could use to discredit politicians online. However, Cambridge Analytica said the report had ""grossly misrepresented"" the conversations caught on camera. The London-based firm, along with the social network, is under scrutiny following claims by a whistleblower, Christopher Wylie, who worked with Cambridge Analytica. He alleges it amassed large amounts of data through a personality quiz on Facebook called This is Your Digital Life. He claims that 270,000 people took the quiz, but the data of some 50 million users, mainly in the US, was harvested without their explicit consent via their friend networks. Mr Wylie says that data was sold to Cambridge Analytica, which then used it to psychologically profile people and deliver pro-Trump material to them, with a view to influencing the outcome of the 2016 presidential election. Facebook boss summoned over data claims The global reach of Cambridge Analytica Cambridge Analytica: The story so far Facebook shares slip as scrutiny continues Facebook has said the data was obtained legitimately, but Cambridge Analytica failed to delete it when subsequently ordered to do so. For its part, Cambridge Analytica says it deleted the data when Facebook told it to. Facebook said on Tuesday that the entire company was ""outraged we were deceived"". ""We are committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people's information and will take whatever steps are required to see that this happens,"" it added. The firm will send representatives to Washington on Wednesday to answer questions before the US Congress. Filming by Channel 4 News,external, broadcast on Tuesday, showed Mr Nix claiming his firm had run Mr Trump's digital campaign. Alexander Nix has been suspended 'with immediate effect' He said that the work the company did, including research, analytics and targeted campaigning, allowed the Republican candidate to win with a narrow margin of ""40,000 votes"" in three states. ""We did all the research, all the data, all the analytics, all the targeting, we ran all the digital campaign, the television campaign and our data informed all the strategy,"" he added. This video can not be played Monday's broadcast showed Mr Nix saying his firm could discredit politicians online A statement from Cambridge Analytica's board of directors said Mr Nix had been suspended with ""immediate effect, pending a full, independent investigation"". It added: ""In the view of the board, Mr Nix's recent comments secretly recorded by Channel 4 and other allegations do not represent the values or operations of the firm and his suspension reflects the seriousness with which we view this violation."" The firm's chief data officer, Dr Alexander Tayler - who was also filmed discussing campaign strategy for Mr Trump - will serve as acting CEO. The undercover report shown on Monday saw Mr Nix describing how he could target individuals. He said one way was to ""offer them a deal that's too good to be true and make sure that video's recorded"". He also said he could ""send some girls around to the candidate's house..."" adding that Ukrainian girls ""are very beautiful, I find that works very well"". Mr Nix continued: ""I'm just giving you examples of what can be done and what has been done."" The managing director of Cambridge Analytica's political division, Mark Turnbull, was also shown saying the company could create proxy organisations to spread negative material about opposition candidates online without being traced. On Monday, Cambridge Analytica said the executives had ""entertained a series of ludicrous hypothetical scenarios"" in order to ""play along with this line of conversation, and partly to spare our 'client' from embarrassment"". And Mr Nix told the BBC's Newsnight programme he felt the firm had been ""deliberately entrapped"". There have now beencalls for an investigationinto the work Cambridge Analytica carried out during the 2013 election in Kenya. This video can not be played Mr Nix spoke to BBC Newsnight before the Channel 4 report was aired on Monday night. He declined to be interviewed after the undercover footage was broadcast Earlier,a parliamentary committee called for Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerbergto give evidence about the use of personal data by Cambridge Analytica. Damian Collins, the chairman of the Commons inquiry into fake news, accused Facebook of ""misleading"" the committee previously,  and said it was ""now time to hear from a senior Facebook executive with the sufficient authority to give an accurate account of this catastrophic failure of process"". Facebook shares fell by a further 5% on Tuesday, following a 6.7% drop on Monday, meaning that in total, about $50bn has been wiped from its market value. The company held an open meeting with its employees on Tuesday to discuss the matter, but the BBC's North America technology reporter Dave Lee said neither Mr Zuckerberg nor his deputy, Sheryl Sandberg, chaired it. Facebook said: ""Mark, Sheryl and their teams are working around the clock to get all the facts and take the appropriate action moving forward, because they understand the seriousness of this issue.""

Facebook data row academic 'a scapegoat',"This video can not be played Cambridge Analytica: What we know so far An academic who created an app that harvested data from 50m Facebook users says Cambridge Analytica and the social media firm have made him a ""scapegoat"". Dr Aleksandr Kogan said he did not know his work for Cambridge Analytica in 2014 violated Facebook's policies. Cambridge Analytica, which worked on Donald Trump's US election campaign, alsoapproached the Conservativesunder David Cameron's leadership. The party had rejected its pitch for work, a No 10 spokesman said. The Ministry of Defence, Home Office and Foreign Office previously had contracts with Cambridge Analytica's parent company SCL, but they ended well before the current issues, Downing Street said. Theresa May, speaking during Prime Minister's Questions earlier, said the allegations were ""clearly very concerning"" and should be ""properly investigated"". The story so far How to protect your Facebook data Facebook's biggest challenge yet In 2014, Facebook invited users to find out their personality type via a quiz developed by Cambridge University researcher Dr Kogan called This is Your Digital Life. About 270,000 users' data was collected, but the app also collected some public data from users' friends. Facebook has since changed the amount of data developers can gather in this way, but a whistleblower, Christopher Wylie, says the data of about 50 million people was harvested for Cambridge Analytica before the rules on user consent were tightened up. This video can not be played Former Cambridge Analytica employee Christopher Wylie says the firm planted fake news Mr Wylie claims the data was sold to Cambridge Analytica - which has no connection with Cambridge University - which then used it to psychologically profile people and deliver pro-Trump material to them. A former Facebook employee has told MPsthe website had a ""Wild West"" approachto looking after users' data. Sandy Parakilas, Facebook's platforms operations manager until 2012, told the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee that the company had ""very few ways"" of discovering abuse or acting on abuse when discovered. The firm's chief executive, Alexander Nix - who was suspended on Tuesday- was secretlyrecorded in a Channel 4 investigation,externalsaying the London-based company ran Donald Trump's digital campaign during the 2016 US election. This video can not be played Tuesday's broadcast showed Mr Nix saying he met Donald Trump 'many times' ""We did all the research, all the data, all the analytics, all the targeting, we ran all the digital campaign, the television campaign and our data informed all the strategy,"" he added. The academic told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the events of the past week had been ""a total shell shock"". ""My view is that I'm being basically used as a scapegoat by both Facebook and Cambridge Analytica when... we thought we were doing something that was really normal. ""We were assured by Cambridge Analytica that everything was perfectly legal and within the terms of service."" He said he was following advice given to him by the UK-based consultancy, but added: ""One of the great mistakes I did here was I just didn't ask enough questions."" He also said the accuracy of the dataset had been ""exaggerated"" by Cambridge Analytica, and had been more likely to hurt than help Mr Trump's campaign. This video can not be played Dr Aleksandr Kogan says he has been treated 'unfairly' by Cambridge Analytica and Facebook The UK's Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham isattempting to obtain a warrantto search the offices of Cambridge Analytica. Meanwhile,a UK parliamentary committee has called for Facebook boss Mark Zuckerbergto give evidence about its use of personal data. Damian Collins, the chairman of the Commons inquiry into fake news, accused Facebook of previously ""misleading"" the committee, and said it was ""now time to hear from a senior Facebook executive with the sufficient authority to give an accurate account of this catastrophic failure of process"".

On Tuesday a Cambridge University spokesperson said they had ""sought and received assurances"" from Dr Kogan that no University data, resources or facilities were used for his work and they had found no evidence to contradict that, but were writing to Facebook to ""request all relevant evidence in their possession"". There have also beencalls for an investigationinto the work Cambridge Analytica carried out during the 2013 election in Kenya. Both Cambridge Analytica and Facebook deny any wrongdoing. Facebook says users' data was obtained legitimately but Cambridge Analytica failed to delete it when told to do so. A Facebook spokesperson said Dr Kogan was not allowed to transfer data to Cambridge Analytica, a third-party who would use the set for commercial purposes. They added that sharing users' friends data outside the app was also against Facebook's rules. This video can not be played Mr Nix spoke to BBC Newsnight before the Channel 4 report was aired on Monday night.

However, the firm said the report of commentssecretly recorded by Channel 4 News,externalhad ""grossly misrepresented"" Mr Nix's comments. Before Channel 4 News had broadcast any of the secret filming, Mr Nix told the BBC's Newsnight programme he felt the firm had been ""deliberately entrapped"". On its website, it says: ""Our team of PHD data scientists, expert researchers, and seasoned political operatives have produced decisive results for campaigns and initiatives throughout the world.""

Cambridge Analytica boss suspended in row,"This video can not be played Tuesday's broadcast showed Mr Nix saying he met Donald Trump 'many times' Cambridge Analytica, the firm involved in a row over its use of Facebook data, has suspended its boss Alexander Nix. The chief executive's comments,secretly recorded by Channel 4 News,external, ""do not represent the values or operations of the firm,"" it said. In the footage, Mr Nix appeared to suggest tactics his company could use to discredit politicians online. However, Cambridge Analytica said the report had ""grossly misrepresented"" the conversations caught on camera. The London-based firm, along with the social network, is under scrutiny following claims by a whistleblower, Christopher Wylie, who worked with Cambridge Analytica. He alleges it amassed large amounts of data through a personality quiz on Facebook called This is Your Digital Life. He claims that 270,000 people took the quiz, but the data of some 50 million users, mainly in the US, was harvested without their explicit consent via their friend networks. Mr Wylie says that data was sold to Cambridge Analytica, which then used it to psychologically profile people and deliver pro-Trump material to them, with a view to influencing the outcome of the 2016 presidential election. Facebook boss summoned over data claims The global reach of Cambridge Analytica Cambridge Analytica: The story so far Facebook shares slip as scrutiny continues Facebook has said the data was obtained legitimately, but Cambridge Analytica failed to delete it when subsequently ordered to do so. For its part, Cambridge Analytica says it deleted the data when Facebook told it to. Facebook said on Tuesday that the entire company was ""outraged we were deceived"". ""We are committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people's information and will take whatever steps are required to see that this happens,"" it added. The firm will send representatives to Washington on Wednesday to answer questions before the US Congress. Filming by Channel 4 News,external, broadcast on Tuesday, showed Mr Nix claiming his firm had run Mr Trump's digital campaign. Alexander Nix has been suspended 'with immediate effect' He said that the work the company did, including research, analytics and targeted campaigning, allowed the Republican candidate to win with a narrow margin of ""40,000 votes"" in three states. ""We did all the research, all the data, all the analytics, all the targeting, we ran all the digital campaign, the television campaign and our data informed all the strategy,"" he added. This video can not be played Monday's broadcast showed Mr Nix saying his firm could discredit politicians online A statement from Cambridge Analytica's board of directors said Mr Nix had been suspended with ""immediate effect, pending a full, independent investigation"". It added: ""In the view of the board, Mr Nix's recent comments secretly recorded by Channel 4 and other allegations do not represent the values or operations of the firm and his suspension reflects the seriousness with which we view this violation."" The firm's chief data officer, Dr Alexander Tayler - who was also filmed discussing campaign strategy for Mr Trump - will serve as acting CEO. The undercover report shown on Monday saw Mr Nix describing how he could target individuals. He said one way was to ""offer them a deal that's too good to be true and make sure that video's recorded"". He also said he could ""send some girls around to the candidate's house..."" adding that Ukrainian girls ""are very beautiful, I find that works very well"". Mr Nix continued: ""I'm just giving you examples of what can be done and what has been done."" The managing director of Cambridge Analytica's political division, Mark Turnbull, was also shown saying the company could create proxy organisations to spread negative material about opposition candidates online without being traced. On Monday, Cambridge Analytica said the executives had ""entertained a series of ludicrous hypothetical scenarios"" in order to ""play along with this line of conversation, and partly to spare our 'client' from embarrassment"". And Mr Nix told the BBC's Newsnight programme he felt the firm had been ""deliberately entrapped"". There have now beencalls for an investigationinto the work Cambridge Analytica carried out during the 2013 election in Kenya. This video can not be played Mr Nix spoke to BBC Newsnight before the Channel 4 report was aired on Monday night. He declined to be interviewed after the undercover footage was broadcast Earlier,a parliamentary committee called for Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerbergto give evidence about the use of personal data by Cambridge Analytica. Damian Collins, the chairman of the Commons inquiry into fake news, accused Facebook of ""misleading"" the committee previously,  and said it was ""now time to hear from a senior Facebook executive with the sufficient authority to give an accurate account of this catastrophic failure of process"". Facebook shares fell by a further 5% on Tuesday, following a 6.7% drop on Monday, meaning that in total, about $50bn has been wiped from its market value. The company held an open meeting with its employees on Tuesday to discuss the matter, but the BBC's North America technology reporter Dave Lee said neither Mr Zuckerberg nor his deputy, Sheryl Sandberg, chaired it. Facebook said: ""Mark, Sheryl and their teams are working around the clock to get all the facts and take the appropriate action moving forward, because they understand the seriousness of this issue.""

Ex-gang man to sue police over shooting,"This video can not be played Former Birmingham gang member on moment police shot him A man who was shot in the chest by armed police is planning to take legal action against the force involved. Sharif Cousins, 41, an ex-gang member turned youth worker, claims he was unarmed with his hands up when he wasshot by West Midlands Policelast July. Mr Cousins, who was in an induced coma for three weeks after the shooting in Birmingham, said: ""I didn't think I was going to make it."" The police watchdog is investigating the circumstances of the shooting. West Midlands Police said it was unable to comment on the individual case. Midlands Live: Man evades police by jumping off bridge; Fire service warning after prank Doritos call Mr Cousins was shot in an alleywayin Hereford Close, Rubery, by armed officers. No charges were ever brought against him in relation to the night of the shooting. The man he was with at the time, 21-year-old Jamael Scarlett, was arrested for previous unrelated offences that night and has sincebeen sentenced to 16 years in prison for drugs and firearms offences. It was the first time someone had been shot by a West Midlands Police officer since 2000, the force confirmed. On the night of the shooting on 26 July he had been watching music videos with Scarlett when they heard about police activity in the area. Speaking to BBC WM, he said he went to get cigarettes for his girlfriend when he was confronted by police. ""At that point police have just run out in the alleyway, out of nowhere - and said 'Stop, put your hands up', or something like that.  So we've put our hands up and then I just heard a bang,"" he said. ""I've looked down at my chest, obviously, and my chest is smoking and stuff."" Armed police were called to Rubery, in south-west Birmingham, at about 21:00 BST on 26 July He said he saw ""a hole"" before falling to the floor. ""I've seen the flash of the gun but I didn't actually believe it happened,"" Mr Cousins continued. ""I'm looking at the policeman saying 'You actually just shot me?' ""By the time I finished my sentence my voice has gone, so I am whispering."" Mr Cousins had previously spent 15 years in prison, including an eight-year term for possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life for pointing a gun at a police officer. But he maintains he has stayed away from trouble since coming out of prison in 2011. ""I'm trying to live my life and be a normal guy,"" he said. Mr Cousins described himself as ""a mentor"" to Scarlett through his work steering youths away from gangs and insists he did not know he was being investigated by police. He explained he did not think he would survive to see his unborn son but ""found some kind of strength to pull past that point"". 'Everybody thinks it's only boys who join gangs' Birmingham gangs banned from city in landmark ruling The non-medics in A&E fighting knife crime effects ""Now that I did pull through I just have to give thanks to God... because males that usually go through these type of situations they don't live to tell the story. They... just end up a statistic,"" he said. ""So you never got to hear their side of what happened."" Despite the force not commenting on the case, Assistant Chief Constable Kenny Bell said he had the ""highest confidence and respect for our firearms officers"". ""They have to make that decision in less than half a second and they will be accountable for that for decades afterwards,"" he said. He said a shooting ""must be absolutely necessary"" and officers must have an honest belief they or a member of the public are ""in imminent danger"". The shooting last July took place in Hereford Close Mr Cousins said he still suffers pain, cannot lift his arm fully and suffers from panic attacks. ""My life has been ruined because of this episode... I'm taking four medications.  I will probably never be the same person again,"" he said. Mr Cousins said he regretted his crimes and felt ""totally remorseful"" about pointing a gun at a police officer. ""I've got eight-and-a-half years' prison for that. I've done my time, I have changed my life since coming out of prison and I've been away from the law,"" he said. He added he wanted to continue working with young people and teaching them about avoiding gangs, as it is ""where my passion lies"". The Independent Office for Police Conduct is expected to publish its findings into the shooting soon and Mr Cousins is planning legal action against the force following its release.

Putin 'will use World Cup like Hitler's Olympics',"This video can not be played Boris agrees with MP's Putin and Hitler comparison Boris Johnson has likened the way President Putin is promoting the World Cup in Russia to Hitler's notorious use of the 1936 Berlin Olympics. The foreign secretary said Labour MP Ian Austin was ""completely right"" to say Russia's president wanted to ""gloss over [his] brutal corrupt regime"". Mr Johnson said that he would have an ""urgent conversation"" with Russia about the safety of fans at the tournament. A Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said he was ""poisoned with hatred"". A Downing Street spokesman confirmed Mr Johnson was speaking on behalf of the government and that they were working closely with police on plans for the World Cup. The foreign secretary said it was of ""crucial importance"" in light of 23 British diplomats being expelled from Russia - including the individual responsible for football fans. So far, there have been 24,000 applications from England fans to attend the World Cup this summer, compared with 94,000 at the same stage in the build-up to Rio in 2014. Mr Johnson said: ""The numbers are well down but that does not mean we are not deeply concerned about how they may be treated."" The Foreign Office will produce detailed travel advice closer to the time. Russian diplomats leave amid spy row Russian spy: What we know so far The exchange came as the Foreign Affairs Select Committee discussed the Salisbury spy attack. Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia remain in a critical condition in hospital after being poisoned with the Russian nerve agent Novichok. The former military intelligence officer and his daughter were found slumped on a bench and unconscious on 4 March. On Thursday, Theresa May will tell EU leaders that although the attempted assassination of the Skripals took place on UK soil, the Russian threat places all European nations at risk. She will tell the European Council summit in Brussels that ""the UK will stand shoulder to shoulder with the EU and with Nato to face these threats together,"" adding: ""United, we will succeed."" Officers still guard areas of Salisbury which the Skripals had visited Earlier, Boris Johnson described it as ""a sign"" from President Putin that ""no-one could escape the long arm of Russian revenge"". He said: ""[The attack] was a sign that President Putin or the Russian state wanted to give to potential defectors in their own agencies: 'This is what happens to you if you decide to support a country with a different set of values. You can expect to be assassinated'."" He also said Russia chose the UK for the attack as it had ""called out"" Russian abuses ""time and again"". Analysis: By James Robbins, BBC diplomatic correspondent Just when you thought relations between Britain and Russia couldn't get any worse. Drawing any sort of parallel between Vladimir Putin and Adolf Hitler is incendiary. Much of Russia's self-image is based on accounts of the Soviet Union's triumph over fascism and Nazism in ""The Great Patriotic War""- never mind that there had been a Nazi-Soviet non-aggression pact until Hitler smashed it by attacking Soviet positions in 1941. Boris Johnson has been trying to keep this major row an international one, pitting Britain and her Western allies against the Kremlin. That international support for Britain undoubtedly remains strong, but just now the diplomatic dispute feels a bit more like a bilateral one- between two states - once again. Adolf Hitler became German leader in 1933 and used Berlin's hosting of the Summer Games of 1936 as part of the propaganda for his Nazi regime. He had already brought in rules in the country to ensure all athletics organisations had an ""Aryan-only"" policy, which led to international backlash. But despite boycott threats, the games went ahead. Speaking at the Commons committee hearing, Mr Austin said: ""The idea of Putin handing over the World Cup to the captain of the winning team; the idea of Putin using this as a PR exercise to gloss over the brutal, corrupt regime for which he is responsible; it fills me with horror,"" he said. Mr Johnson could be heard saying, ""I'm afraid that's completely right, completely right"", during Mr Austin's comments. The foreign secretary then added: ""Your characterisation of what is going to happen in Moscow in the World Cup, in all the venues, yes, I think the comparison with 1936 is certainly right. ""I think it is an emetic prospect frankly to think of Putin glorying in this sporting event."" However, when Mr Austin said he believed the football team should pull out of the competition, Mr Johnson disagreed. ""On balance it would be wrong to punish them [the fans] or the team who have worked on this for an incredibly long time, given up their lives to it,"" he said. On the issue of fan safety, Mr Johnson said he needed to have an ""urgent conversation"" with the Russians around how they ""propose to fulfil their obligations under their FIFA contract to look after all fans"". The England team is in training for the competition this summer However, he admitted this conversation had yet to take place. Despite the attack, Mr Johnson said the overall aim of improving relations with Russia -as discussed during his trip to Moscow in December 2017- remained ""effectively unchanged"". He claimed the UK had ""many admirers among the Russian people"" and the UK wanted to ""hold out the hand of friendship"" to them, as the quarrel was with the Kremlin, not the citizens. Meanwhile, the British ambassador to Russia, Laurie Bristow, has been accused of snubbing a meeting called by the foreign ministry in Moscow to discuss Skripal case. A tweet from the Foreign Office said a representative did attend, but added: ""We received no credible explanation why a nerve agent produced in Russia was used on UK soil. ""Instead, Russia continues to spread lies & disinformation."" Dmitry Peskov, a spokesman for President Putin, said: ""Perhaps this is another eloquent demonstration of the absurdity of the situation when questions are being asked but the unwillingness to hear some answers is being shown."" Officers are helping inspectors with their equipment in Salisbury Speaking at the meeting, Russian foreign ministry official Vladimir Yermakov suggested the UK might have been behind the attack. ""Either the British authorities are not able to provide protection from such a, let's say, terrorist attack on their soil, or they, whether directly or indirectly, I am not accusing anyone, have orchestrated an attack on a Russian citizen,"" he said. Mr Yermakov also disputed the UK's finding that Novichok was used in the attack. ""Any use of a military-grade poison would inevitably lead to numerous casualties immediately on the site of the poisoning,"" he said. ""The picture in Salisbury is completely different."" In Salisbury, inspectors from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons have arrived to begin collecting evidence, including at The Mill pub, where the Skripals drank before falling ill.

PM quizzed over Cambridge Analytica links,"Theresa May has been challenged to explain alleged Tory links to firms at the centre of a dispute over the harvesting and use of personal data. The SNP's Ian Blackford said SCL, the parent company of Cambridge Analytica, has been run by a chairman of Oxford Conservative Association. He also claimed its founding chairman was a former Tory MP and a director had donated over Â£700,000 to the party. The PM said she was not aware of any current contracts with the firms. Prime Minister's Questions: The verdict We made mistakes, admits Facebook chief Cambridge Analytica: The data firm's global influence The story so far The prime minister's official spokesman later said that three government departments had had contracts with the SCL Group in the past. Political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica is facing questions over whether it used the personal data of millions of Facebook users to sway the outcome of the US 2016 presidential election and the UK Brexit referendum. The company has suspended its CEO, Alexander Nix, who was filmed as part of a Channel 4 investigation giving examples of how the firm could swing elections around the world with underhand tactics such as smear campaigns and honey traps. Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has admitted the company ""made mistakes"" in its dealings with Cambridge Analytica and a ""breach of trust"" had occurred between the social media giant and its users. In a statement,external, he promised to strengthen the way users' data is protected to prevent ""harvesting"". And he said app developers that misused personally identifiable information would be banned from accessing the platform. This video can not be played Blackford: Tory links to Cambridge Analytica go ""on and on"" At Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, Mr Blackford, the SNP's Westminster leader, raised the issue saying links between the Conservative Party and SCL - Strategic Communications Laboratories - the parent company of Cambridge Analytica, ""go on and on"". He told MPs SCL ""has been run by a chairman of Oxford Conservative Association"", and added: ""It's founding chairman was a former Conservative MP - a director appears to have donated over Â£700,000 to the Tory party. ""A former Conservative party treasurer is a shareholder. We know about the links to the Conservative party - they go on and on."" He asked Theresa May to confirm to the Commons ""your government's connections to the company"". Cambridge Analytica: Facebook boss summoned over data claims The PM replied that allegations concerning the two firms were ""clearly very concerning"". ""As far as I'm aware, the government has no current contracts with Cambridge Analytica or with the SCL group,"" she said. ""It's absolutely right that they are properly investigated and the information commissioner is doing exactly that. ""People need to have confidence in how their personal data is being used. I would expect Facebook, Cambridge Analytica and all organisations involved to comply fully with the investigation that's taking place."" Cambridge Analytica's CEO has been suspended after he was filmed giving examples of how the firm could swing elections She added that a bill is being brought forward on data protection that will give tougher powers to the Information Commissioner's Office - which scrutinises the use of the public's private data for political purposes - to ensure organisations comply. Asked whether government departments have had contracts with the SCL group, the prime minister's official spokesman said there had been three. These were a Ministry of Defence data project in 2014-2015 - when there was a Conservative-Lib Dem coalition government - plus a Home Office training project and a Foreign Office communications project in during Gordon Brown's Labour government. A Conservative party spokesman said: ""The Conservative Party has never employed Cambridge Analytica, or its parent company, nor used their services."" Cambridge Analytica, along with Facebook, is under scrutiny following claims by a whistleblower, Christopher Wylie, who worked with Cambridge Analytica, a London-based firm. He alleges it amassed large amounts of data through a personality quiz on Facebook called This is Your Digital Life. He claims that 270,000 people took the quiz, but the data of some 50 million users, mainly in the US, was harvested without their explicit consent via their friend networks. Mr Wylie says that data was sold to Cambridge Analytica, which then used it to psychologically profile people and deliver pro-Trump material to them, with a view to influencing the outcome of the 2016 presidential election.

Wage growth eases household squeeze,"Wage growth has picked up and unemployment has edged lower, according to the latest official data. The Office for National Statistics said that, compared with a year earlier, earnings grew by 2.6%, for the three months to the end of January. That was up from 2.5% in the previous quarter and adds to evidence that the squeeze on household income may be coming to an end. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate ticked lower to 4.3% from 4.4%. A small increase in the number of unemployed people during the quarter did not dent the overall rise in employment over the last year. The data was not all positive - the number of unemployment benefit claimants rose by 9,200 to 838,000 in February, that's the highest level in more than three years. But John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC, said the good news in the latest figures outweighed the bad. ""In particular, with consumer inflation falling back to 2.7% in February, we are now close to the point where real pay growth returns to positive territory,"" he said. ""But it will still be many years before real wage levels return to the peak seen before the financial crisis."" The BBC has learnt that than a million NHSstaff, including nurses, porters and paramedics, can expect pay increases of at least 6.5% over three years. If approved, workers in England could see their pay increase almost immediately. The economy: Three better things, one worry Six reasons behind the High Street crisis Economists are now wondering whether the improved outlook for pay will spur the Bank of England to raise interest rates from the current low levels. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) should be cautious about raising the interest rate. He said: ""We continue to think that wage growth will rise at only a modest pace this year, ensuring that the MPC needs to raise interest rates only by 0.25% in 2018.""

"Kidnapped schoolgirls freed in NigeriaSome 101 out of 110 abducted girls are returned to Dapchi town, Nigeria says - but five are thought dead.4h4 hours agoAfrica","A relieved man wipes away a tear after the girls, who went missing on 19 February, arrived back in Dapchi Nearly all of the 110 Nigerian schoolgirls kidnapped by militants in the town of Dapchi last month have been returned, the government says. Officials said at least 101 girls were reunited with their families after being brought back to the town. The girls were later flown to the capital, Abuja, where they were due to meet President Muhammadu Buhari. Reports suggest at least five girls died during their ordeal, and that a Christian girl remains captive. Who are Boko Haram? Dapchi families' heartbreak and despair One of the freed girls, in a phone conversation with a relative, said the five had been crushed to death as they were herded into vehicles and driven away. The girl said she and the others were taken into the bush, to an ""enclosed place"". When asked whether they were well fed, she said they had to cook their own food. The government did not make any mention of deaths, or otherwise explain the discrepancy between the 110 abducted and the 101 returned. There were scenes of celebration in Dapchi. The girls arrived in the town in the early hours of this morning One parent, Kundili Bukar, told the BBC the militants had driven into the town in a motorcade in the early hours of Wednesday morning and surrendered the girls to the community. Government officials indicated their relief. The government had been strongly criticised after the abduction on 19 February, amid reports that the military had pulled out of Dapchi the day before. Nigeria had already suffered the Chibok kidnapping, when 276 girls were snatched from a school in April 2014. More than 100 are still missing. Among those to witness the release of the Dapchi girls were some of the Chibok parents, who had gone to the town to console its residents on their loss. ""Our visit became something else,"" one of the Chibok mothers told Reuters news agency, adding that the scenes of reunion made her weep for the fate of her own daughter. The secret diaries of the Chibok girls What we know about Chibok kidnappings And while many parents celebrated, the father of one girl said she was being kept by the militants - thought to be from the Boko Haram group - because she refused to convert from Christianity to Islam. In a radio interview he said he was happy that she had not renounced her faith. The BBC's Tomi Oladipo says the government is likely to have given something in return for the girls' release. But Nigeria's Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, told Reuters that ""no ransom was paid"". Mr Lai Mohammed said the girls were taken to hospital in Dapchi, and they would be quarantined and offered psychological counselling before going back to school. However, one parent told the BBC the extremists had warned them not to send their daughters back to school, or they would be kidnapped again. By Tomi Oladipo, BBC Africa security correspondent The return of more than 70 Dapchi schoolgirls indicates that a Boko Haram faction, led by Abu Musab al-Barnawi, is taking a different approach to kidnappings. Negotiations for the Chibok girls' release proved difficult under Boko Haram's leader Abubakar Shekau. More than 100 of them still remain in captivity. But despite reports, Wednesday's release did not come free. Boko Haram definitely got something in return for waltzing back into Dapchi and dropping off the girls. The problem going forward is that this will encourage the IS-linked militants to once again raid another community and abduct another set of people. The Nigerian government might feel like it has averted the kind of global disrepute that plagued the administration of former President Goodluck Jonathan following its poor response to the kidnapping of the Chibok girls. But this is only a minor PR victory for President Muhammadu Buhari's administration. Boko Haram and its various factions suffered no losses on Wednesday and they will remain a scourge in Nigeria. Six questions about Nigeria's 'new Chibok' Nigeria mass girl kidnaps a 'disaster' Why January is Boko Haram's deadliest month Why reporting on Boko Haram is hard The woman standing up to Boko Haram.

Back pain care 'too often wrong'Experts are asking the medical profession to stop offering ineffective and potentially harmful treatments.12m12 minutes agoHealth,"Lower back pain is the leading cause of disability globally but too often patients are let down by the treatment they are offered, say experts. They have written a series of papers inThe Lancet,externalasking the worldwide medical profession to stop offering ineffective and potentially harmful treatments. Strong drugs, injections and surgery are generally overkill, they say, with limited evidence that they help. Most back pain is best managed by keeping active, they advise. Recommendations that doctors follow in the UK are clear about what investigations and treatment patients should expect. Some patients will require a scan to rule out underlying causes, but in most cases they are deemed unnecessary because they are likely to be inconclusive. Signs that something more significant might be wrong include: difficulty passing urine feeling the needing to pass urine, when there is none there impaired sexual function such as loss of sensation during intercourse numbness or tingling in the genitals or buttocks loss of bladder or bowel control loss of power in legs Most adults will experience back pain at some point. Episodes are usually short-lasting with no consequence, but recurrence is common - about one in three people will have a recurrence within a year of recovering from a previous bout, according to the researchers. UK guidelines recommend a mix of physical exercise, advice and support to help patients cope with symptoms and enjoy a better quality of life. Health staff should not treat back pain or sciatica with equipment such as belts, corsets, foot supports or shoes with special soles. They should not offer acupuncture, traction (stretching the back using weights or machines), or electrotherapy (passing electric current or ultrasound waves through the body), says theNational Institute for Health and Care Excellence,external. A doctor may offer an opioid pain medicine, such as codeine, if anti-inflammatory drugs, such as aspirin, have not helped or the doctor thinks they are not right for the patient. But opioid pain medicine can cause dependence. 1) Your back is stronger than you may think - the spine is strong and not easily damaged, so in most instances the pain will be down to a simple sprain or strain 2) You rarely need a scan 3) Avoid bed rest and get moving (but avoid aggravating activities) 4) Do not fear bending or lifting - do it in a way that is comfortable, using the hips and knees 5) Remember that exercise and activity can reduce and prevent back pain 6) Painkillers will not speed up your recovery 7) Surgery is rarely needed 8) Get good quality sleep if you can, because it will help you feel better overall 9) You can have back pain without any damage or injury 10) If it doesn't clear up, seek help but don't worry - book an appointment to see your doctor or physiotherapist if the pain persists Source:Chartered Society of Physiotherapy,external Prof Martin Underwood, from Warwick University, who is one of the 31 authors of The Lancet papers, said: ""Our current treatment approaches are failing to reduce the burden of back pain disability. ""We need to change the way we approach back pain treatment in the UK and help low- and middle-income countries to avoid developing high-cost services of limited effectiveness. ""Quite a lot of people get exposed to high-tech medical and invasive procedures. There's very little evidence base to support their use."" Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard, who chairs the Royal College of GPs, said: ""One size does not fit all."" ""We know that being active and working is good for our patients' health, so GPs and our teams will readily advocate lifestyle changes to patients that can help ease their pain and keep them in work, but for some patients, particularly in more serious cases, there is a limit to how realistic a significant amount of exercise is. ""For these patients whilst not a cure, drug-therapy can provide a great deal of relief and should not be dismissed entirely - the most effective approach, as with any medication, is that it should be prescribed at the lowest possible dose for the shortest possible time."" She added: ""It is also the case that access to psychological treatments, such as talking therapies, which we know can be beneficial for patients suffering from lower back pain, is patchy across the country.""

Kuenssberg: The NHS pay plan,"Put your money where your mouth is? Well, I'm told that when it comes to the NHS, ministers plan to do that with taxpayers' money, with a pay deal for NHS staff in England that could mean more than Â£4bn over the next three years. More than a million staff, including nurses, porters and paramedics, could expect average increases of about 6%, after years of a tight spending settlement. The idea is that the lowest paid will get the biggest hikes, with those on the lowest wages receiving the most significant rises, for example a porter's salary could rise from Â£15,000 to Â£19,000. And contrary to recent suggestions, the unions and the government won't force staff to give up a day's holiday in return for bigger pay rises. But insiders say that the deal, to be signed off at lunchtime, does include an agreement for staff and the Department of Health to look for ways of reducing rates of sickness in the NHS and changes to automatic pay rises, so called increments. If the deal is formally announced, as expected, a consultation with staff will follow. But I'm told the biggest health unions, Unison and the Royal College of Nursing, are poised to back the agreement after months of negotiations with multiple unions, the government and NHS Employers. Potentially, if the 'I's' are dotted and the 'T's crossed, NHS staff could look forward to pay increases as early as July. The government indicated some time ago that the pay cap, which had been one of the main restrictions that held back public spending, was over. But this deal could pave the way for expensive, even if overdue, pay deals for other parts of the public sector. Crucially, sources say the deal will be fully funded by the Treasury, rather than coming out of existing NHS budgets. The precise detail of what ministers say later will therefore be vital. But the move is likely to add to the growing sense,including in Tory party, that somehow, more cash for the health service needs to be found.

"Suspect identified in Texas bombing spreeMark Anthony Conditt, 23, has been named by US media as the suspect who died after triggering a device.1ma minute agoUS & Canada","This video can not be played Police chief Brian Manley announced the suspect's death to the media Police have named the suspect they say carried out a deadly series of parcel bombs in the Texas city of Austin as Mark Anthony Conditt, 23. He was killed after detonating an explosive as officers approached his car following a chase in Round Rock, north of the Texas state capital. Officials say he lived about 20 miles (30km) from Austin in a shared home. Investigators say with a ""reasonable level of certainty"" there are no more devices to endanger the public. Police told reporters that Conditt - suspected of five blasts that killed two people and injured six others - made a video ""confession"" on his phone. The 25-minute clip was recovered from the handset after he blew himself up on Wednesday as police closed in. ""He does not at all mention anything about terrorism, nor does he mention anything about hate, but instead it is the outcry of a very challenged young man, talking about challenges in his personal life,"" Austin Police Chief Brian Manley told reporters. Before his death Conditt had been criminally charged with one count of unlawful possession and transfer of a destructive device, the US attorney for the Western District of Texas said in a press release on Wednesday. The suspect was pictured dropping off parcel bombs at a FedEx store Conditt lived with two flatmates in Pflugerville, north of Austin, says investigators. The flatmates have been talking to authorities, but were not suspected of any crimes. Authorities said they found several components inside the property that match the devices used in the other attacks. Texas Governor Greg Abbot told Fox News that the suspect had not erased his online footprint, which may provide a ""treasure trove of information that should shed light on who he is, what he did, and why he was doing it"". Austin rattled by days of bomb attacks Conditt attended the Austin Community College from 2010 to 2012, but did not graduate. The BBC has confirmed that this 2013 photo is of Mark Conditt The Austin American-Statesman newspaper reports he was home-schooled by his mother during his high-school years. ""I officially graduated Mark from High School,"" his mother wrote on Facebook in a 2013 post showing her son. ""He's thinking of taking some time to figure out what he wants to do... maybe a [religious] mission trip,"" his mother wrote. The newspaper reports that he had recently worked for Crux Semiconductor in Austin as a ""purchasing Agent/buyer/shipping and receiving"", citing a profile on a job recruiting website. US media have uncovered a 2012 blog which was written under the suspect's name and appeared to be for a university course that he attended. In the blog called Defining my Stance, he purportedly describes beliefs that ""gay marriage should be illegal"", opposition to abortion and why the sex offender registry should be eliminated. In the blog, he defines himself as ""a conservative"". ""But I don't think I have enough information to defend my stance as well as it should be defended,"" he says, adding that he is taking the course ""because I want to understand the US government, and I hope that it will help me clarify my stance"". The Austin police department on Tuesday used footage from a FedEx store in south Austin, the scene of the latest parcel bomb explosion, to identify the suspect. Police found several pieces of evidence to lead to Conditt, including unusual batteries and screws used in each device, according to CBS News. After using the Google search engine to gather information on the suspect's online browsing history, authorities later managed to locate his vehicle. Early on Wednesday, local and federal officers took up positions around a parking area near a hotel in Round Rock. As they waited for tactical teams to arrive, the vehicle started to drive away and officers pursued it. When the vehicle eventually pulled over, armed officers approached, but the suspect then detonated a bomb, injuring one officer. Allow Twitter content?

This video can not be played Texas explosions: What we know about bombings By Gary O'Donoghue, BBC News, Austin This was a dramatic denouement to a three-week reign of terror. It was only in the past 36 hours or so that police really got a handle on the possible identity of the suspect, who had foxed them for weeks by changing the nature of his targets and his method of operation. But the sheer number of devices - six in all - in such a short period of time may have been one factor that eventually led to his pursuit and apparent suicide. Another crucial factor was the one device that didn't go off. That gave police key leads and allowed them to isolate CCTV evidence of the suspect dropping off one of the devices at a FedEx office. As police continue to gather evidence at the scene, motivation will be the question on everyone's lips in Texas. Authorities have said that a series of blasts that began in Austin in early March - involving package bombs and a tripwire - were all related: 2 March:A device explodes at Anthony Stephan House's home in Austin, killing the 39-year-old man 13 March:Draylen William Mason, 17, is killedand his mother is critically injured after he brings a package inside his home from the doorstep in Austin 13 March:Hours later, a 75-year-old Hispanic woman, who has not been named, is injured by another package in the state capital 18 March:A device injures two men who may have set off a tripwire while walking along a street in Austin 20 March:A parcel bomb explodes at a FedEx depot in Schertz, slightly injuring one person.

Michael Gove has said he shares the ""disappointment"" but urged people to keep their ""eyes on the prize"" of getting full control of UK waters back. Michael Gove shares fishing industry 'disappointment' UK and EU agree Brexit transition terms In a sign of government unease about the reaction, Theresa May met MPs with fishing ports in their seats on Tuesday in an attempt to explain their approach. Speaking from the fishing trawler, former UKIP leader Nigel Farage told Sky News the government did not have the ""guts"" to stand up to the EU. ""They told us they would take back control in 2019 - that is not happening. We are now told at the start of 2021 it may happen,"" he said. ""I don't think this government has got the guts or the strength to stand up and take back our territorial waters."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Conservative backbencher Ross Thomson, who is MP for Aberdeen South, said he was ""really disappointed"" fishing communities will not regain control of UK waters as soon as it leaves the 27-nation bloc. Speaking from the fishing trawler, he said: ""Literally within seconds of our leaving (the EU), we're handing all of that back."" Mr Thomson, who was among the delegation of MPs to see Mrs May, said that while it was a ""productive"" meeting, ""we were very, very clear that we'll only support an end deal if it delivers for our fishing communities - and we have been absolutely clear that this is a red line for us"". Mrs May is hoping the deal will be signed off at a meeting of leaders at the European Council summit in Brussels this week, clearing the way for crucial talks on post-Brexit trade to begin in earnest. Having your fish and eating it too But 14 MPs, including leading backbench Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg, said the proposal for Britain effectively to remain in the EU's Common Fisheries Policy for almost two years after Brexit day in March 2019, with no say over the allocation of quotas, would not command the support of the Commons. ""These demands are completely unacceptable and would be rejected by the House of Commons,"" they said. Speaking from the quayside in Westminster, Mr Rees-Mogg said the EU ""desperately needs our money"" so the negotiating strength was with the UK. He added: ""Am I pleased with the transition deal? No, I can't begin to pretend to be. I don't like the transition deal, but I can live with it."" 11,800 fishermen and women were active in the UK - 2,300 were part-time UK fishing industry had 6,191 fishing vessels UK vessels landed 701,000 tonnes of sea fish into the UK and abroad with a value of Â£936m The UK fishing fleet was seventh largest in the EU in terms of vessel numbers, with the second largest capacity Peterhead, Aberdeenshire, was the port with the highest landings - 145,000 tonnes with a value of Â£158m Newlyn, in Cornwall, had the highest quantity of landings in England - 14,100 tonnes with a value of Â£28m UK caught the majority of its fish, 81% by quantity, in its own EEZ (Exclusive Economic Zone which extends no more than 200 nautical miles from the shore) This amounted to 571,000 tonnes of fish worth Â£774m from the UK EEZ with Mackerel, Nephrops and King Scallop landings accounting for 43% of this total value Lobsters commanded the highest average price of all species landed by the UK fleet at over Â£12 a kilo Boats from other EU countries land about 650,000 tonnes of fish and shellfish in UK waters worth over Â£400m each year (according to the House of Commons library) UK fishing boats land an average of 90,000 tonnes of fish and shellfish, worth Â£100 million, caught in other EU member states' waters each year.

Find out the gender pay gap where you work,"Time's almost up for the UK's biggest companies to publish their gender pay gap, but so far only a third have done so. Two weeks before the deadline, more than 6,000 companies have not disclosed the average difference between what they pay male and female employees. Noncompliant companies face legal action, the government has warned. The CBI says it's difficult for some firms to compile the data, and that smaller companies need more support. Want to find out the gender pay gap at your company? Try the calculator below. Sorry, your browser does not support this lookup       If you can't see the calculator,click here,external. The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) says it will be ""fully enforcing"" the pay gap legislation and will write to companies that do not report by the deadline. Firms could face an unlimited fine if they continue to fail to publish the figures. What is the gender pay gap? Equality campaign group the Fawcett Society said it should be easier for the EHRC to use its powers. ""Government must make the Equalities and Human Rights Commission's enforcement powers stronger by changing the law,"" Fawcett Society chief executive Sam Smethers said. The Commission should have civil enforcement powers similar to HMRC, which has theability to fine firms for minimum wage transgressionsmore quickly, she added. Most firms pay men more than women. More than three quarters of organisations that have published have a gender pay gap. About 14% pay women more on average than men, while 8% said they have no pay gap at all. Some of the biggest pay gaps are in aviation and financial services.Jet2.com, Thomson Airways, TUI airways and Easyjet all have median pay gaps between 45% and 50%, which many of them attribute to the prevalence of male pilots. The finance and insurance sectorhas the biggest average gap of 35.6%,,externalaccording to the ONS. Brenda Trenowden is global chair of the 30% Club, which aims to increase the number of women on boards. She said revealing pay gap figures is not a ""quick fix"" to solving complex issues of equality and representation in the workplace. ""Rather than just talking about the shocking extent of the gender pay gap, we need to focus on what companies need to do to overcome the structural imbalance behind it,"" she said. ""There are a combination of factors - including better management of women, appropriate senior role models, and breaking down the gender bias - which need to be implemented as basic steps towards achieving this. ""There is far too much sensationalism and blame around this topic. We need constructive comment around why the gap exists and what can be done to overcome it."" Neil Carberry, of business lobby group the CBI, said these figures are of not much use in a vacuum. The business industry group is encouraging its members to publish an action plan alongside their figures in order to ""make sure the transparency means something,"" he said. He added that the UK will see a ""significant surge"" in reporting over the next two weeks but added ""it's a complex task, especially for those [firms] just over the threshold"". ""I expect non-reporting will cluster around the smaller end of the reporting group and a good policy would be to help these companies, rather than smack them over the head with a big stick,"" Mr Carberry said. Want to learn more about the gender gap? Try asking our bot below. Equal pay and the gender pay gap are two different things. Equal pay is awarding men and women the same amount to do identical or equivalent work. This is a legal requirement in the UK and has been for many years. The gender pay gap is the difference between average earnings for men and women. If women are being paid more, that's called a negative pay gap. Under new legislation, companies with 250 employees or more arelegally required to publish their gender pay gap,externalby 4 April, while the deadline for the public sector is 30 March. Having a gender pay gap isn't illegal, but failing to publicly disclose a figure by the deadline is. Companies are also encouraged to publish an action plan if needs be, to show how they intend to address the gap. The UK has a national median pay gap of 18.4%, as of April last year,according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).,external This is calculated by using the median average for men and women, which is the level of pay that half of people earn more than, and half earn less than. It's calculated on an hourly basis and includes full time and part-time workers. It's the key measurement used by the ONS. Companies have to publish both the median pay gap for their employees and the mean average gap, which is all salaries added together and divided by the number of people on the payroll. Data as of 8am on 20 March. Individual company data has been reported by companies to the Government Equalities Office. All gender pay gap figures in this article reflect the hourly median pay gap for all employees. The national and sector gender pay gap figures come from the 2017 ONS ASHE survey.

Putin 'will use Cup like Hitler's Olympics',"This video can not be played Boris agrees with MP's Putin and Hitler comparison Boris Johnson has likened the way President Putin is promoting the World Cup in Russia to Hitler's notorious use of the 1936 Berlin Olympics. The foreign secretary said Labour MP Ian Austin was ""completely right"" to say Russia's president wanted to ""gloss over [his] brutal corrupt regime"". Mr Johnson said that he would have an ""urgent conversation"" with Russia about the safety of fans at the tournament. A Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said he was ""poisoned with hatred"". A Downing Street spokesman confirmed Mr Johnson was speaking on behalf of the government and that they were working closely with police on plans for the World Cup. The foreign secretary said it was of ""crucial importance"" in light of 23 British diplomats being expelled from Russia - including the individual responsible for football fans. So far, there have been 24,000 applications from England fans to attend the World Cup this summer, compared with 94,000 at the same stage in the build-up to Rio in 2014. Mr Johnson said: ""The numbers are well down but that does not mean we are not deeply concerned about how they may be treated."" The Foreign Office will produce detailed travel advice closer to the time. Russian diplomats leave amid spy row Russian spy: What we know so far The exchange came as the Foreign Affairs Select Committee discussed the Salisbury spy attack. Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia remain in a critical condition in hospital after being poisoned with the Russian nerve agent Novichok. The former military intelligence officer and his daughter were found slumped on a bench and unconscious on 4 March. On Thursday, Theresa May will tell EU leaders that although the attempted assassination of the Skripals took place on UK soil, the Russian threat places all European nations at risk. She will tell the European Council summit in Brussels that ""the UK will stand shoulder to shoulder with the EU and with Nato to face these threats together,"" adding: ""United, we will succeed."" Officers still guard areas of Salisbury which the Skripals had visited Earlier, Boris Johnson described it as ""a sign"" from President Putin that ""no-one could escape the long arm of Russian revenge"". He said: ""[The attack] was a sign that President Putin or the Russian state wanted to give to potential defectors in their own agencies: 'This is what happens to you if you decide to support a country with a different set of values. You can expect to be assassinated'."" He also said Russia chose the UK for the attack as it had ""called out"" Russian abuses ""time and again"". Analysis: By James Robbins, BBC diplomatic correspondent Just when you thought relations between Britain and Russia couldn't get any worse. Drawing any sort of parallel between Vladimir Putin and Adolf Hitler is incendiary. Much of Russia's self-image is based on accounts of the Soviet Union's triumph over fascism and Nazism in ""The Great Patriotic War""- never mind that there had been a Nazi-Soviet non-aggression pact until Hitler smashed it by attacking Soviet positions in 1941. Boris Johnson has been trying to keep this major row an international one, pitting Britain and her Western allies against the Kremlin. That international support for Britain undoubtedly remains strong, but just now the diplomatic dispute feels a bit more like a bilateral one- between two states - once again. Adolf Hitler became German leader in 1933 and used Berlin's hosting of the Summer Games of 1936 as part of the propaganda for his Nazi regime. He had already brought in rules in the country to ensure all athletics organisations had an ""Aryan-only"" policy, which led to international backlash. But despite boycott threats, the games went ahead. Speaking at the Commons committee hearing, Mr Austin said: ""The idea of Putin handing over the World Cup to the captain of the winning team; the idea of Putin using this as a PR exercise to gloss over the brutal, corrupt regime for which he is responsible; it fills me with horror,"" he said. Mr Johnson could be heard saying, ""I'm afraid that's completely right, completely right"", during Mr Austin's comments. The foreign secretary then added: ""Your characterisation of what is going to happen in Moscow in the World Cup, in all the venues, yes, I think the comparison with 1936 is certainly right. ""I think it is an emetic prospect frankly to think of Putin glorying in this sporting event."" However, when Mr Austin said he believed the football team should pull out of the competition, Mr Johnson disagreed. ""On balance it would be wrong to punish them [the fans] or the team who have worked on this for an incredibly long time, given up their lives to it,"" he said. On the issue of fan safety, Mr Johnson said he needed to have an ""urgent conversation"" with the Russians around how they ""propose to fulfil their obligations under their FIFA contract to look after all fans"". The England team is in training for the competition this summer However, he admitted this conversation had yet to take place. Despite the attack, Mr Johnson said the overall aim of improving relations with Russia -as discussed during his trip to Moscow in December 2017- remained ""effectively unchanged"". He claimed the UK had ""many admirers among the Russian people"" and the UK wanted to ""hold out the hand of friendship"" to them, as the quarrel was with the Kremlin, not the citizens. Meanwhile, the British ambassador to Russia, Laurie Bristow, has been accused of snubbing a meeting called by the foreign ministry in Moscow to discuss Skripal case. A tweet from the Foreign Office said a representative did attend, but added: ""We received no credible explanation why a nerve agent produced in Russia was used on UK soil. ""Instead, Russia continues to spread lies & disinformation."" Dmitry Peskov, a spokesman for President Putin, said: ""Perhaps this is another eloquent demonstration of the absurdity of the situation when questions are being asked but the unwillingness to hear some answers is being shown."" Officers are helping inspectors with their equipment in Salisbury Speaking at the meeting, Russian foreign ministry official Vladimir Yermakov suggested the UK might have been behind the attack. ""Either the British authorities are not able to provide protection from such a, let's say, terrorist attack on their soil, or they, whether directly or indirectly, I am not accusing anyone, have orchestrated an attack on a Russian citizen,"" he said. Mr Yermakov also disputed the UK's finding that Novichok was used in the attack. ""Any use of a military-grade poison would inevitably lead to numerous casualties immediately on the site of the poisoning,"" he said. ""The picture in Salisbury is completely different."" In Salisbury, inspectors from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons have arrived to begin collecting evidence, including at The Mill pub, where the Skripals drank before falling ill.

Austin bombings suspect killed in blast,"This video can not be played ""The suspect is deceased,"" says police chief Brian Manley A suspect linked with a series of deadly parcel bombs targeting the Texan city of Austin is dead after a major police operation, officials say. The man was killed after detonating a device when officers approached his car off a highway in the city of Round Rock, north of the state capital. He has been named by US media as Mark Anthony Conditt, aged 23. The incident follows four bomb attacks in Austin and one in Schertz, 65 miles (104km) south. Late on Tuesday, the Austin police department used footage from a FedEx store in south Austin, the scene of the latest parcel bomb explosion, to identify the male suspect. After using the Google search engine to gather information on the suspect's online browsing history, which showed searches on facilities which were used to ship packages, authorities later managed to locate his vehicle. In the early hours of Wednesday, local and federal officers then took up positions around a parking area belonging to a hotel in Round Rock, about 20 miles (32km) north of Austin. As they waited for tactical teams to arrive, the vehicle started to drive away, and officers pursued it. When the vehicle drove into a ditch, armed officers approached, hoping to take the suspect into custody alive. But the driver then detonated a bomb, injuring one officer. Another officer opened fire.

Police later confirmed that the blast had killed the suspect. Austin police chief Brian Manley said that local residents should ""remain vigilant"", and urged anyone who noticed a suspicious package to contact the authorities. ""We don't know where the suspect has been over this past 24 hours,"" he said, adding that it was possible that additional devices may have been distributed. ""We do not understand what motivated him to do what he did,"" Chief Manley added. Mr Manley also praised his colleagues in a tweet. ""I can't thank the men and women of #AustinPD or our Federal partners enough for their tireless work in restoring peace to our community,"" he said. Earlier, CCTV images of a ""person of interest"" were shared on US media showing a white male with blond hair carrying a number of large packages at a FedEx store in Austin. Allow Twitter content?

Austin has been on edge amid the attacks, which have led to the deployment of hundreds of police officers in the city. Two people have been killed and six injured in the bombings. Police have not formally identified the suspect, who has been named in US media as Mark Anthony Conditt, aged 23. Texas Governor Greg Abbot told Fox News that he lived with two flatmates in Pflugerville, a suburb of Austin. ""Those two roommates have been talking to law enforcement,"" Mr Abbott said, adding they are not suspected of any crimes. The governor added that the suspect did not destroy his online footprint, which may provide investigators with a ""treasure trove of information that should shed light on who he is, what he did, and why he was doing it"". According to the Austin Statesman newspaper Mr Conditt graduated from the  Austin Community College after he was homeschooled by his mother during his high school years. The newspaper reports that he had worked for Crux Semiconductor in Austin as a ""purchasing Agent/buyer/shipping and receiving"", citing a profile on a job recruiting website. This video can not be played Texas explosions: What we know about bombings By Gary O'Donoghue, BBC News, Austin This was a dramatic denouement to a three-week reign of terror. It was only in the past 36 hours or so that police really got a handle on the possible identity of the suspect, who had foxed them for weeks by changing the nature of his targets and his method of operation. But the sheer number of devices - six in all - in such a short period of time may have been one factor that eventually led to his pursuit and apparent suicide. Another crucial factor was the one device that didn't go off. That gave police key leads and allowed them to isolate CCTV evidence of the suspect dropping off one of the devices at a FedEx office. As police continue to gather evidence at the scene, motivation will be the question on everyone's lips in Texas. And while this might feel like it's over, the admission from police that they don't know where the suspect was for the past day means more devices could be out there and it is too soon for Austin to completely relax. Authorities have said that a series of blasts that began in Austin in early March - involving package bombs and a tripwire - were all related: 2 March:A device explodes at Anthony Stephan House's home in Austin, killing the 39-year-old man 13 March:Draylen William Mason, 17, is killedand his mother is critically injured after he brings a package inside his home from the doorstep in Austin 13 March:Hours later, a 75-year-old Hispanic woman, who has not been named, is injured by another package in the state capital 18 March:A device injures two men who may have set off a tripwire while walking along a street in Austin 20 March:A parcel bomb explodes at a FedEx depot in Schertz, slightly injuring one person.

Kidnapped schoolgirls freed in Nigeria,"A relieved man wipes away a tear after the girls, who went missing on 19 February, arrived back in Dapchi Nearly all of the 110 Nigerian schoolgirls kidnapped by militants in the town of Dapchi last month have been returned, the government says. Officials said at least 101 girls were reunited with their families after being brought back to the town. The girls were later flown to the capital, Abuja, where they were due to meet President Muhammadu Buhari. Reports suggest at least five girls died during their ordeal, and that a Christian girl remains captive. Who are Boko Haram? Dapchi families' heartbreak and despair One of the freed girls, in a phone conversation with a relative, said the five had been crushed to death as they were herded into vehicles and driven away. The girl said she and the others were taken into the bush, to an ""enclosed place"". When asked whether they were well fed, she said they had to cook their own food. The government did not make any mention of deaths, or otherwise explain the discrepancy between the 110 abducted and the 101 returned. There were scenes of celebration in Dapchi. The girls arrived in the town in the early hours of this morning One parent, Kundili Bukar, told the BBC the militants had driven into the town in a motorcade in the early hours of Wednesday morning and surrendered the girls to the community. Government officials indicated their relief. The government had been strongly criticised after the abduction on 19 February, amid reports that the military had pulled out of Dapchi the day before. Nigeria had already suffered the Chibok kidnapping, when 276 girls were snatched from a school in April 2014. More than 100 are still missing. Among those to witness the release of the Dapchi girls were some of the Chibok parents, who had gone to the town to console its residents on their loss. ""Our visit became something else,"" one of the Chibok mothers told Reuters news agency, adding that the scenes of reunion made her weep for the fate of her own daughter. The secret diaries of the Chibok girls What we know about Chibok kidnappings And while many parents celebrated, the father of one girl said she was being kept by the militants - thought to be from the Boko Haram group - because she refused to convert from Christianity to Islam. In a radio interview he said he was happy that she had not renounced her faith. The BBC's Tomi Oladipo says the government is likely to have given something in return for the girls' release. But Nigeria's Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, told Reuters that ""no ransom was paid"". Mr Lai Mohammed said the girls were taken to hospital in Dapchi, and they would be quarantined and offered psychological counselling before going back to school. However, one parent told the BBC the extremists had warned them not to send their daughters back to school, or they would be kidnapped again. By Tomi Oladipo, BBC Africa security correspondent The return of more than 70 Dapchi schoolgirls indicates that a Boko Haram faction, led by Abu Musab al-Barnawi, is taking a different approach to kidnappings. Negotiations for the Chibok girls' release proved difficult under Boko Haram's leader Abubakar Shekau. More than 100 of them still remain in captivity. But despite reports, Wednesday's release did not come free. Boko Haram definitely got something in return for waltzing back into Dapchi and dropping off the girls. The problem going forward is that this will encourage the IS-linked militants to once again raid another community and abduct another set of people. The Nigerian government might feel like it has averted the kind of global disrepute that plagued the administration of former President Goodluck Jonathan following its poor response to the kidnapping of the Chibok girls. But this is only a minor PR victory for President Muhammadu Buhari's administration. Boko Haram and its various factions suffered no losses on Wednesday and they will remain a scourge in Nigeria. Six questions about Nigeria's 'new Chibok' Nigeria mass girl kidnaps a 'disaster' Why January is Boko Haram's deadliest month Why reporting on Boko Haram is hard The woman standing up to Boko Haram.

Salisbury attack 'sign' from Putin,"This video can not be played Boris agrees with MP's Putin and Hitler comparison Boris Johnson has likened the way President Putin is promoting the World Cup in Russia to Hitler's notorious use of the 1936 Berlin Olympics. The foreign secretary said Labour MP Ian Austin was ""completely right"" to say Russia's president wanted to ""gloss over [his] brutal corrupt regime"". Mr Johnson said that he would have an ""urgent conversation"" with Russia about the safety of fans at the tournament. A Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said he was ""poisoned with hatred"". A Downing Street spokesman confirmed Mr Johnson was speaking on behalf of the government and that they were working closely with police on plans for the World Cup. The foreign secretary said it was of ""crucial importance"" in light of 23 British diplomats being expelled from Russia - including the individual responsible for football fans. So far, there have been 24,000 applications from England fans to attend the World Cup this summer, compared with 94,000 at the same stage in the build-up to Rio in 2014. Mr Johnson said: ""The numbers are well down but that does not mean we are not deeply concerned about how they may be treated."" The Foreign Office will produce detailed travel advice closer to the time. Russian diplomats leave amid spy row Russian spy: What we know so far The exchange came as the Foreign Affairs Select Committee discussed the Salisbury spy attack. Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia remain in a critical condition in hospital after being poisoned with the Russian nerve agent Novichok. The former military intelligence officer and his daughter were found slumped on a bench and unconscious on 4 March. On Thursday, Theresa May will tell EU leaders that although the attempted assassination of the Skripals took place on UK soil, the Russian threat places all European nations at risk.

He said: ""[The attack] was a sign that President Putin or the Russian state wanted to give to potential defectors in their own agencies: 'This is what happens to you if you decide to support a country with a different set of values. You can expect to be assassinated'."" He also said Russia chose the UK for the attack as it had ""called out"" Russian abuses ""time and again"". Analysis: By James Robbins, BBC diplomatic correspondent Just when you thought relations between Britain and Russia couldn't get any worse. Drawing any sort of parallel between Vladimir Putin and Adolf Hitler is incendiary. Much of Russia's self-image is based on accounts of the Soviet Union's triumph over fascism and Nazism in ""The Great Patriotic War""- never mind that there had been a Nazi-Soviet non-aggression pact until Hitler smashed it by attacking Soviet positions in 1941. Boris Johnson has been trying to keep this major row an international one, pitting Britain and her Western allies against the Kremlin. That international support for Britain undoubtedly remains strong, but just now the diplomatic dispute feels a bit more like a bilateral one- between two states - once again. Adolf Hitler became German leader in 1933 and used Berlin's hosting of the Summer Games of 1936 as part of the propaganda for his Nazi regime. He had already brought in rules in the country to ensure all athletics organisations had an ""Aryan-only"" policy, which led to international backlash. But despite boycott threats, the games went ahead. Speaking at the Commons committee hearing, Mr Austin said: ""The idea of Putin handing over the World Cup to the captain of the winning team; the idea of Putin using this as a PR exercise to gloss over the brutal, corrupt regime for which he is responsible; it fills me with horror,"" he said. Mr Johnson could be heard saying, ""I'm afraid that's completely right, completely right"", during Mr Austin's comments. The foreign secretary then added: ""Your characterisation of what is going to happen in Moscow in the World Cup, in all the venues, yes, I think the comparison with 1936 is certainly right. ""I think it is an emetic prospect frankly to think of Putin glorying in this sporting event."" However, when Mr Austin said he believed the football team should pull out of the competition, Mr Johnson disagreed. ""On balance it would be wrong to punish them [the fans] or the team who have worked on this for an incredibly long time, given up their lives to it,"" he said. On the issue of fan safety, Mr Johnson said he needed to have an ""urgent conversation"" with the Russians around how they ""propose to fulfil their obligations under their FIFA contract to look after all fans"". The England team is in training for the competition this summer However, he admitted this conversation had yet to take place. Despite the attack, Mr Johnson said the overall aim of improving relations with Russia -as discussed during his trip to Moscow in December 2017- remained ""effectively unchanged"". He claimed the UK had ""many admirers among the Russian people"" and the UK wanted to ""hold out the hand of friendship"" to them, as the quarrel was with the Kremlin, not the citizens. Meanwhile, the British ambassador to Russia, Laurie Bristow, has been accused of snubbing a meeting called by the foreign ministry in Moscow to discuss Skripal case. A tweet from the Foreign Office said a representative did attend, but added: ""We received no credible explanation why a nerve agent produced in Russia was used on UK soil. ""Instead, Russia continues to spread lies & disinformation."" Dmitry Peskov, a spokesman for President Putin, said: ""Perhaps this is another eloquent demonstration of the absurdity of the situation when questions are being asked but the unwillingness to hear some answers is being shown."" Officers are helping inspectors with their equipment in Salisbury Speaking at the meeting, Russian foreign ministry official Vladimir Yermakov suggested the UK might have been behind the attack. ""Either the British authorities are not able to provide protection from such a, let's say, terrorist attack on their soil, or they, whether directly or indirectly, I am not accusing anyone, have orchestrated an attack on a Russian citizen,"" he said. Mr Yermakov also disputed the UK's finding that Novichok was used in the attack. ""Any use of a military-grade poison would inevitably lead to numerous casualties immediately on the site of the poisoning,"" he said. ""The picture in Salisbury is completely different."" In Salisbury, inspectors from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons have arrived to begin collecting evidence, including at The Mill pub, where the Skripals drank before falling ill.

Prime Minister's Questions: The verdictTheresa May clashed with Jeremy Corbyn over council funding - here are the key bits.1han hour agoUK Politics,"Theresa May went head-to-head with Jeremy Corbyn in the House of Commons. Here's what happened. Voters across England go to the polls on 3 May in local elections - and this Prime Minister's Questions gave us a sneak preview of the sort of campaign they can expect. It looks like it won't be pretty. Jeremy Corbyn kicked off by challenging Theresa May to say if the collapse of Tory-run Northamptonshire County Council was a result of Conservative ""incompetence"" locally or nationally. It was one of those carefully-crafted PMQs posers that is meant to put the PM in an impossible position and had Labour MPs baying for an answer. Mrs May simply ignored it and instead declared ""Conservative councils cost you less"". This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn asks who is to blame for Tory council's woes Mr Corbyn had another go, highlighting the boasts of Northampton's Tory leader who had once said his authority had pioneered the ""easy council"" model, where as many services as possible are outsourced to the private sector. ""Does the prime minister believe that the slash-and-burn model for local government is really a good one?,"" asked Mr Corbyn. The PM pointed to a report by an independent inspector who had said the council's problems were not down to underfunding. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mr Corbyn accused the government of ""prioritising tax cuts for the super rich and big business"" over funding for social care, libraries and bin collections. The mention of bins allowed Mrs May to get in a swipe at a Labour-run Birmingham council's bin strike. She then revealed what she thought was her trump card - judging from the sing-song voice she adopted as she drew her reply out - comments by Labour's shadow local government secretary Andrew Gwynne, who she claimed wanted to stop voters' ability to block large local tax rises while also backing a land value tax and a ""new hotel tax"".

Mrs May switched to a political attack on Labour's ""hard left"", reading out a list of Labour council leaders she claimed had been forced out. This sent the Commons volume up - prompting Speaker Bercow to tell MPs to emulate the ""Zen-like"" calm of Ken Clarke, the father of the House. ""We all admire Zen,"" observed Mr Corbyn. There were further angry exchanges about local government finance - and further attempts by the PM to needle Mr Corbyn about allegations of anti-Semitism in his party and the alleged persecution of ""moderates"". Mr Corbyn threw in a quote from retail guru Mary Portas, a one-time Tory adviser, criticising the government. But Mrs May got the final word, as she always does at PMQs, and used it to trumpet the latest unemployment figures, which she said were the best since 1975. Allow Twitter content?

What the BBC's Parliamentary Correspondent Mark D'Arcy made of it: Ho-hum. Another scrappy score draw in the Vauxhall Conference. The PM seemed surprised that Jeremy Corbyn chose to attack on council cuts - and his opening question on the woes of (Conservative controlled) Northamptonshire County Council, now effectively bankrupt and recommended for abolition, left her discomforted. But as Mr Corbyn pivoted from Northants to Surrey and Leicestershire, Theresa May recovered herself and started citing examples of quitting Labour council leaders and Labour activists switching to her party. Maybe the fact that she had such obvious lines of retaliation available to her explained her surprise. Perhaps Mr Corbyn's most effective moment came when he pointed to the impact of rising business rates - a subject that genuinely worries many Conservatives - but he did not press that attack very far. In many ways this was a prototypical May-Corbyn exchange - him: ""cuts are badâ¦"" Her: ""Labour would be worse."" Parliamentary artistry it isn't. Perhaps the most politically interesting aspect of this session was the exchanges on fisheries, The government knows it is in a difficult position over the transitional deal it has struck with the EU. Fishing communities which hoped to see Britain pull out of the Common Fisheries Policy on Brexit Day have been disappointed - and infuriated. Scottish Conservative MPs, many of whom would lose their seats if their fisher-folk turned against them, are deeply worried and have already expressed their disappointment. There were discouraged from doing so again, today. But the intervention from Brexiteer ex-minister Mark Francois demonstrated that it is not just constituency interest that drives backbench Tory disquiet; there are plenty of Tories who are very disappointed on ideological grounds - and are putting down markers against a longer-term compromise of fishing rights after the transition. The PM came prepared with a carefully-worded answer on this issue, but she knows it will not go away, and that she faces a real dilemma, because the electoral cost of failure on this issue could be a reverse of those vital Tory gains in Scotland. The SNP's Drew Hendry cashed in on Tory discomfort, but his Leader, Ian Blackford, raised the Cambridge Analytica saga, detailing the links between the company and Conservative Party figures. The PM did not enjoy that - and it may have been Mr Blackford's most effective moment at PMQs since assuming the SNP's Westminster leadership. Allow Twitter content?

Facebook data row academic 'is scapegoat',"This video can not be played Cambridge Analytica: What we know so far An academic who created an app that harvested data from 50m Facebook users says Cambridge Analytica and the social media firm have made him a ""scapegoat"". Dr Aleksandr Kogan said he did not know his work for Cambridge Analytica in 2014 violated Facebook's policies. Cambridge Analytica, which worked on Donald Trump's US election campaign, alsoapproached the Conservativesunder David Cameron's leadership. The party had rejected its pitch for work, a No 10 spokesman said. The Ministry of Defence, Home Office and Foreign Office previously had contracts with Cambridge Analytica's parent company SCL, but they ended well before the current issues, Downing Street said. Theresa May, speaking during Prime Minister's Questions earlier, said the allegations were ""clearly very concerning"" and should be ""properly investigated"". The story so far How to protect your Facebook data Facebook's biggest challenge yet In 2014, Facebook invited users to find out their personality type via a quiz developed by Cambridge University researcher Dr Kogan called This is Your Digital Life. About 270,000 users' data was collected, but the app also collected some public data from users' friends. Facebook has since changed the amount of data developers can gather in this way, but a whistleblower, Christopher Wylie, says the data of about 50 million people was harvested for Cambridge Analytica before the rules on user consent were tightened up. This video can not be played Former Cambridge Analytica employee Christopher Wylie says the firm planted fake news Mr Wylie claims the data was sold to Cambridge Analytica - which has no connection with Cambridge University - which then used it to psychologically profile people and deliver pro-Trump material to them. A former Facebook employee has told MPsthe website had a ""Wild West"" approachto looking after users' data. Sandy Parakilas, Facebook's platforms operations manager until 2012, told the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee that the company had ""very few ways"" of discovering abuse or acting on abuse when discovered. The firm's chief executive, Alexander Nix - who was suspended on Tuesday- was secretlyrecorded in a Channel 4 investigation,externalsaying the London-based company ran Donald Trump's digital campaign during the 2016 US election. This video can not be played Tuesday's broadcast showed Mr Nix saying he met Donald Trump 'many times' ""We did all the research, all the data, all the analytics, all the targeting, we ran all the digital campaign, the television campaign and our data informed all the strategy,"" he added. The academic told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the events of the past week had been ""a total shell shock"". ""My view is that I'm being basically used as a scapegoat by both Facebook and Cambridge Analytica when... we thought we were doing something that was really normal. ""We were assured by Cambridge Analytica that everything was perfectly legal and within the terms of service."" He said he was following advice given to him by the UK-based consultancy, but added: ""One of the great mistakes I did here was I just didn't ask enough questions."" He also said the accuracy of the dataset had been ""exaggerated"" by Cambridge Analytica, and had been more likely to hurt than help Mr Trump's campaign. This video can not be played Dr Aleksandr Kogan says he has been treated 'unfairly' by Cambridge Analytica and Facebook The UK's Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham isattempting to obtain a warrantto search the offices of Cambridge Analytica. Meanwhile,a UK parliamentary committee has called for Facebook boss Mark Zuckerbergto give evidence about its use of personal data. Damian Collins, the chairman of the Commons inquiry into fake news, accused Facebook of previously ""misleading"" the committee, and said it was ""now time to hear from a senior Facebook executive with the sufficient authority to give an accurate account of this catastrophic failure of process"". Facebook boss summoned over data claims India takes down Cambridge Analytica site WhatsApp co-founder: Time to delete Facebook Facebook shares slip as scrutiny continues US senators have called on Mr Zuckerberg to testify before Congress about how his company will protect users, while consumer watchdog the US Federal Trade Commission hasalso reportedly opened an investigation into Facebook. This video can not be played Mark Zuckerberg in 2009: Facebook privacy is central The head of the European Parliament also said it would investigate to see if the data was misused. On Tuesday a Cambridge University spokesperson said they had ""sought and received assurances"" from Dr Kogan that no University data, resources or facilities were used for his work and they had found no evidence to contradict that, but were writing to Facebook to ""request all relevant evidence in their possession"". There have also beencalls for an investigationinto the work Cambridge Analytica carried out during the 2013 election in Kenya. Both Cambridge Analytica and Facebook deny any wrongdoing. Facebook says users' data was obtained legitimately but Cambridge Analytica failed to delete it when told to do so. A Facebook spokesperson said Dr Kogan was not allowed to transfer data to Cambridge Analytica, a third-party who would use the set for commercial purposes. They added that sharing users' friends data outside the app was also against Facebook's rules. This video can not be played Mr Nix spoke to BBC Newsnight before the Channel 4 report was aired on Monday night. He declined to be interviewed after the undercover footage was broadcast For its part, Cambridge Analytica says it did delete the data when told to by Facebook.

Tech giants face European 'digital tax',"This video can not be played The EU tax system is not set up for digital businesses, says EU economics affairs commissioner Pierre Moscovici. Big technology firms face paying more tax under plans announced by the European Commission. It said companies with significant online revenues should pay a 3% tax on turnover for various online services, bringing in an estimated â¬5bn (Â£4.4bn). The proposal would affect firms such as Facebook and Google with global annual revenues above â¬750m and taxable EU revenue above â¬50m. The move follows criticism that tech giants pay too little tax in Europe. EU economics affairs commissioner Pierre Moscovici said the ""current legal vacuum is creating a serious shortfall in the public revenue of our member states"". He stressed it was not a move against the US or ""GAFA"" - the acronym for Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon. According to the Commission, top digital firms pay an average tax rate of just 9.5% in the EU - far less than the 23.3% paid by traditional companies. Its figures are disputed by the big tech firms, which have called the tax proposal ""populist and flawed"". Countries including the UK and France have accused firms of routing some profits through low-tax EU member states such as Ireland and Luxembourg. Big US tech companies have argued they are complying with national and international tax laws. However, the Commission said it wanted to tax companies according to where their digital users are based. Analysis: Kamal Ahmed, BBC economics editor It doesn't appear that Britain's journey towards the exit door of the European Union is causing too much consternation in Brussels over whether these new tech tax proposals will ever be implemented. The EU commissioner behind today's proposals has told me ""there is no blocking attitude from the UK"". Pierre Moscovici said that whilst Britain remained a member of the EU, he expected Philip Hammond to play a positive role in supporting the changes. He also said that he believed the plans could be agreed by the end of the year - before Britain departs - and would be discussed tomorrow at the EU summit which will be attended by Theresa May. Some will say Mr Moscovici's timetable is overly-ambitious, and that gaining agreement from all the EU member states will prove difficult. His answer to that? That the political direction of travel is clear, voters want to see digital giants like Facebook and Google pay more tax. And here is a thought through plan to do it. Read more The tax would only apply to certain online revenue streams, such as online advertising in search engines or social media, online trading, or the sale of user data. The proposals require backing from the European Parliament and the 28 EU countries, but they are divided on the issue. EU tax reforms need the backing of all member states to become law. Ireland has warned that the proposals may not yield more tax, while some countries believe smaller companies should also face a bill. The business practices of big tech firms are facing growing scrutiny in Europe. Competition regulators have fined Apple and Amazon, while Google is appealing against a record â¬2.4bn fine for abusing its dominance to favour its own shopping services. EU agencies are also set to tighten rules on data privacy, while Germany has introduced big fines for social media firms who fail to take down extreme content quickly enough.

Ministers talking about more NHS cash,"There won't be a red box brandished on the steps of Number 11, a pint won't be up a penny or down a couple, and the chancellor certainly won't have to reach for a stiffener under the despatch box, like some of his predecessors who had a whiskey stashed there for the odd sip or two to get through a marathon Parliamentary statement. What there also will not be in Philip Hammond's spring statement are grand gestures of new spending; no big cheques being signed by Mr Hammond to portion out your money. With the balance of the books improving, the chancellor might sound a bit cheerier than at his last big outing. The public spending numbers appear much healthier than before Christmas. Unless he undergoes a personality transplant overnight, however, he's hardly going to be chucking money about with abandon. Expect instead a focus on paying down the debt and taking a ""balanced approach"" - that's the government's code for carrying on with tight public spending to pay off the public debt. The argument over the deficit may be over, mostly. But the government wants now to focus on the debt. The Hammond case is that we might have cleared the overdraft, but we still have a hefty mortgage that needs to be paid down. But just because Tuesday's spring statement will be skimpy, it doesn't mean there aren't bigger conversations about the future of the public purse going on. In fact, senior figures in government have told me there are discussions going on in government about one of the biggest political priorities of all - the NHS. Several senior sources say that, at the end of January, the cabinet discussed ways of getting more money into the health service in the long term. That included the foreign secretary's by now familiar argument about the hoped-for but disputed Brexit dividend. But more intriguingly for a Conservative government, I'm told that the cabinet discussed the possibility of tax rises to fund more spending for the NHS, even a hypothecated tax,as spelled out by senior MPs like Nick Boles. This does seem to be rather a change of heart. For months last year, and on the general election trail, the prime minister maintained, time and again, that the NHS has the money that it needs - the funds that it requested. With the opposition and senior Tories calling for a long-term look at the levels of cash, the line seemed to stay the same. In January this year, the prime minister repeated that ""we have put money in that was asked for in that review, and we've actually put some extra money in, in the spring statement and the Budget last  year to deal with this. ""You keep talking about the money but actually what you also need to look at is how the NHS works."" Behind closed doors however, that position is shifting. One cabinet minister told me ""most of us accept now that something has to happen - we have to find a way"". Another said: ""It's hard to see how healthcare won't need more money"". A different cabinet minister accepted that ""conversations are very live"" about the best way to make sure that the NHS is getting what it needs. There is no consensus in government yet about the right way to go. Number 10 isn't suddenly about to turn the spending taps on and flood the health service with money. But at the highest levels of government there is a growing acceptance that the NHS will need more cash, even if the government is far from settling when or how.

Undercover police inquiry head urged to go,"This video can not be played Phillippa Kaufmann QC Campaigners have walked out of a public inquiry into undercover policing, demanding that the chairman stand down or appoint a full panel. The inquiry was set up in 2015 to investigate claims of wrongdoing by forces in England and Wales. But campaigners are unhappy that ex-undercover officers were granted anonymity during the proceedings. Phillippa Kaufmann QC, representing campaigners, said core participants could not participate meaningfully. Police took 'squatters' rights on dead children's identities Undercover police inquiry: Can it get to the truth? Undercover inquiry: Why it matters At Wednesday's hearing, Ms Kaufmann read a statement on behalf of campaigners, criticising chairman Sir John Mitting and his decisions around the anonymity of officers. She said: ""If you don't get this right now, then so much of what has gone wrong with undercover operations will remain secret. ""I'm sorry to say this, we have the usual white middle class elderly gentleman whose life experiences are a million miles away from those who were spied upon."" Ms Kaufmann claimed that the reasoning for not releasing the names of certain police officers was ""scant and largely uninformative"" and said her clients asked chairman Sir John Mitting to recuse himself or to install a new panel. After the statement was read out, around 60 people, including alleged victims, campaigners and their legal teams, walked out of the Royal Courts of Justice. Baroness Doreen Lawrence has backed the walk out, accusing Sir John of preventing her from finding out who spied on her family as they sought justice for her murdered son, Stephen. The inquiry was launched in 2015 after allegations that Scotland Yard infiltrated the Stephen Lawrence campaign 20 years ago. In a statement, Baroness Lawrence, who could not attend court on Wednesday, accused Sir John of being influenced by his own publicly-stated ""old fashioned and naive views"". ""He is turning what should be a transparent, accountable and public hearing into an inquiry cloaked in secrecy and anonymity,"" she said. ""I want to know the names of the police officers who spied on me, my family and our campaign for justice. The chair is not allowing that, in my view, for reasons which are completely unjustifiable and unreasonable."" She called on Sir John to resign or for a panel to be appointed ""before any more public money is spent"", adding: ""Anything less than this will lead me to consider carefully whether I should continue to participate in this inquiry."" A woman known as Cathy, from campaign group Police Spies Out of Lives, said Sir John's appointment ""seems to give more weight to the privacy of the officers"" rather than the alleged victims. She said: ""We've all been disappointed at the slow rate of progress and the complete lack of disclosure."" ""There are two key questions. What were the cover names, and which groups were spied on? ""Without those two bits of information it's nigh-on impossible for people to come forward to say this is what happened to me and my group."" By Dominic Casciani, BBC home affairs correspondent The undercover inquiry is now three years old - and so far behind schedule that it was already meant to be delivering its final report to ministers. Instead it has become mired in a legal stand-off that this morning became personal with a remarkable attack on a High Court judge by a leading barrister. In the majority of anonymity applications that Sir John Mitting has so far assessed, he has been minded to protect officers' identities in some shape or form. He is adamant he can get to the bottom of wrongdoing - but campaigners say that's impossible unless they are told who the officers targeting political groups were. It is not remotely clear where the inquiry goes from here. One of the women that brought the court action against the Metropolitan Police said her experience of undercover policing ""completely ripped apart my life"". Helen Steel said she was ""deceived"" into a two-year relationship with an undercover police officer called John Dines, who she later discovered had infiltrated the London Greenpeace organisation in the 1980s. ""We lived together, we talked about planning a family and we talked about spending the rest of our lives together,"" she said. ""After a while he began acting strangely and seemed to go through a mental breakdown and then he disappeared."" He left home in 1992, and Ms Steel later found out that he had been using the identity of a dead child. Helen Steel had no idea her partner of two years was an undercover police officer who had infiltrated London Greenpeace The Undercover Policing Inquiry (UCPI),launched by the then-Home Secretary Theresa May, was due to finish this year, but has been beset by delays - including the death of its original chairman Sir Christopher Pitchford. It is expected to take another year before all the evidence is heard. The allegation being looked into by the inquiry is that undercover policing units that had developed over 40 years were out of control. Incidents included: Officers from the Metropolitan Police force's now disbanded Special Demonstration Squad (SDS) tricking women, whom they were targeting, into sexual relationships Some of them used the names of dead babies to create a cover story complete with birth records Some of these infiltrations led to proven miscarriages of justice The most toxic allegation that triggered the inquiry was that an officer infiltrated the Stephen Lawrence justice campaign Police took 'squatters' rights' on dead children's identities Undercover inquiry: Why it matters Undercover police inquiry to be held Death toll rises amid most destructive wildfire in Los Angeles' history Moment friends abandon house as Palisades fire closes in 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Why does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?

Fishing deal protest outside Parliament,"This video can not be played Nigel Farage throws fish in protest at EU deal Protesters have thrown dead fish into the Thames outside Parliament as they oppose the Brexit transition deal. The fishing industry and many coastal MPs are unhappy that the UK will not regain control of the country's fishing waters on Brexit day, 29 March 2019. Instead it will be subject to EU rules for 21 months until December 2020. Michael Gove has said he shares the ""disappointment"" but urged people to keep their ""eyes on the prize"" of getting full control of UK waters back. Michael Gove shares fishing industry 'disappointment' UK and EU agree Brexit transition terms In a sign of government unease about the reaction, Theresa May met MPs with fishing ports in their seats on Tuesday in an attempt to explain their approach. Speaking from the fishing trawler, former UKIP leader Nigel Farage told Sky News the government did not have the ""guts"" to stand up to the EU. ""They told us they would take back control in 2019 - that is not happening. We are now told at the start of 2021 it may happen,"" he said. ""I don't think this government has got the guts or the strength to stand up and take back our territorial waters."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Conservative backbencher Ross Thomson, who is MP for Aberdeen South, said he was ""really disappointed"" fishing communities will not regain control of UK waters as soon as it leaves the 27-nation bloc. Speaking from the fishing trawler, he said: ""Literally within seconds of our leaving (the EU), we're handing all of that back."" Mr Thomson, who was among the delegation of MPs to see Mrs May, said that while it was a ""productive"" meeting, ""we were very, very clear that we'll only support an end deal if it delivers for our fishing communities - and we have been absolutely clear that this is a red line for us"". Mrs May is hoping the deal will be signed off at a meeting of leaders at the European Council summit in Brussels this week, clearing the way for crucial talks on post-Brexit trade to begin in earnest. Having your fish and eating it too But 14 MPs, including leading backbench Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg, said the proposal for Britain effectively to remain in the EU's Common Fisheries Policy for almost two years after Brexit day in March 2019, with no say over the allocation of quotas, would not command the support of the Commons. ""These demands are completely unacceptable and would be rejected by the House of Commons,"" they said. Speaking from the quayside in Westminster, Mr Rees-Mogg said the EU ""desperately needs our money"" so the negotiating strength was with the UK. He added: ""Am I pleased with the transition deal? No, I can't begin to pretend to be. I don't like the transition deal, but I can live with it."" 11,800 fishermen and women were active in the UK - 2,300 were part-time UK fishing industry had 6,191 fishing vessels UK vessels landed 701,000 tonnes of sea fish into the UK and abroad with a value of Â£936m The UK fishing fleet was seventh largest in the EU in terms of vessel numbers, with the second largest capacity Peterhead, Aberdeenshire, was the port with the highest landings - 145,000 tonnes with a value of Â£158m Newlyn, in Cornwall, had the highest quantity of landings in England - 14,100 tonnes with a value of Â£28m UK caught the majority of its fish, 81% by quantity, in its own EEZ (Exclusive Economic Zone which extends no more than 200 nautical miles from the shore) This amounted to 571,000 tonnes of fish worth Â£774m from the UK EEZ with Mackerel, Nephrops and King Scallop landings accounting for 43% of this total value Lobsters commanded the highest average price of all species landed by the UK fleet at over Â£12 a kilo Boats from other EU countries land about 650,000 tonnes of fish and shellfish in UK waters worth over Â£400m each year (according to the House of Commons library) UK fishing boats land an average of 90,000 tonnes of fish and shellfish, worth Â£100 million, caught in other EU member states' waters each year.

"Kidnapped schoolgirls freed in NigeriaNo ransom was paid for the 76 out of 110 girls who were brought home to Dapchi, the government says.","A relieved man wipes away a tear after the girls, who went missing on 19 February, arrived back in Dapchi Nearly all of the 110 Nigerian schoolgirls kidnapped by militants in the town of Dapchi last month have been returned, the government says. Officials said at least 101 girls were reunited with their families after being brought back to the town. The girls were later flown to the capital, Abuja, where they were due to meet President Muhammadu Buhari. Reports suggest at least five girls died during their ordeal, and that a Christian girl remains captive. Who are Boko Haram? Dapchi families' heartbreak and despair One of the freed girls, in a phone conversation with a relative, said the five had been crushed to death as they were herded into vehicles and driven away. The girl said she and the others were taken into the bush, to an ""enclosed place"". When asked whether they were well fed, she said they had to cook their own food. The government did not make any mention of deaths, or otherwise explain the discrepancy between the 110 abducted and the 101 returned. There were scenes of celebration in Dapchi. The girls arrived in the town in the early hours of this morning One parent, Kundili Bukar, told the BBC the militants had driven into the town in a motorcade in the early hours of Wednesday morning and surrendered the girls to the community. Government officials indicated their relief. The government had been strongly criticised after the abduction on 19 February, amid reports that the military had pulled out of Dapchi the day before. Nigeria had already suffered the Chibok kidnapping, when 276 girls were snatched from a school in April 2014. More than 100 are still missing. Among those to witness the release of the Dapchi girls were some of the Chibok parents, who had gone to the town to console its residents on their loss. ""Our visit became something else,"" one of the Chibok mothers told Reuters news agency, adding that the scenes of reunion made her weep for the fate of her own daughter. The secret diaries of the Chibok girls What we know about Chibok kidnappings And while many parents celebrated, the father of one girl said she was being kept by the militants - thought to be from the Boko Haram group - because she refused to convert from Christianity to Islam. In a radio interview he said he was happy that she had not renounced her faith. The BBC's Tomi Oladipo says the government is likely to have given something in return for the girls' release. But Nigeria's Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, told Reuters that ""no ransom was paid"". Mr Lai Mohammed said the girls were taken to hospital in Dapchi, and they would be quarantined and offered psychological counselling before going back to school. However, one parent told the BBC the extremists had warned them not to send their daughters back to school, or they would be kidnapped again. By Tomi Oladipo, BBC Africa security correspondent The return of more than 70 Dapchi schoolgirls indicates that a Boko Haram faction, led by Abu Musab al-Barnawi, is taking a different approach to kidnappings. Negotiations for the Chibok girls' release proved difficult under Boko Haram's leader Abubakar Shekau. More than 100 of them still remain in captivity. But despite reports, Wednesday's release did not come free. Boko Haram definitely got something in return for waltzing back into Dapchi and dropping off the girls. The problem going forward is that this will encourage the IS-linked militants to once again raid another community and abduct another set of people. The Nigerian government might feel like it has averted the kind of global disrepute that plagued the administration of former President Goodluck Jonathan following its poor response to the kidnapping of the Chibok girls.

"Kidnapped schoolgirls freed in NigeriaNo ransom was paid for the 76 out of 110 girls who were brought home to Dapchi, the government says.1han hour agoAfrica","A relieved man wipes away a tear after the girls, who went missing on 19 February, arrived back in Dapchi Nearly all of the 110 Nigerian schoolgirls kidnapped by militants in the town of Dapchi last month have been returned, the government says. Officials said at least 101 girls were reunited with their families after being brought back to the town. The girls were later flown to the capital, Abuja, where they were due to meet President Muhammadu Buhari. Reports suggest at least five girls died during their ordeal, and that a Christian girl remains captive. Who are Boko Haram? Dapchi families' heartbreak and despair One of the freed girls, in a phone conversation with a relative, said the five had been crushed to death as they were herded into vehicles and driven away. The girl said she and the others were taken into the bush, to an ""enclosed place"". When asked whether they were well fed, she said they had to cook their own food. The government did not make any mention of deaths, or otherwise explain the discrepancy between the 110 abducted and the 101 returned. There were scenes of celebration in Dapchi. The girls arrived in the town in the early hours of this morning One parent, Kundili Bukar, told the BBC the militants had driven into the town in a motorcade in the early hours of Wednesday morning and surrendered the girls to the community. Government officials indicated their relief. The government had been strongly criticised after the abduction on 19 February, amid reports that the military had pulled out of Dapchi the day before. Nigeria had already suffered the Chibok kidnapping, when 276 girls were snatched from a school in April 2014. More than 100 are still missing. Among those to witness the release of the Dapchi girls were some of the Chibok parents, who had gone to the town to console its residents on their loss. ""Our visit became something else,"" one of the Chibok mothers told Reuters news agency, adding that the scenes of reunion made her weep for the fate of her own daughter. The secret diaries of the Chibok girls What we know about Chibok kidnappings And while many parents celebrated, the father of one girl said she was being kept by the militants - thought to be from the Boko Haram group - because she refused to convert from Christianity to Islam. In a radio interview he said he was happy that she had not renounced her faith. The BBC's Tomi Oladipo says the government is likely to have given something in return for the girls' release. But Nigeria's Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, told Reuters that ""no ransom was paid"". Mr Lai Mohammed said the girls were taken to hospital in Dapchi, and they would be quarantined and offered psychological counselling before going back to school. However, one parent told the BBC the extremists had warned them not to send their daughters back to school, or they would be kidnapped again. By Tomi Oladipo, BBC Africa security correspondent The return of more than 70 Dapchi schoolgirls indicates that a Boko Haram faction, led by Abu Musab al-Barnawi, is taking a different approach to kidnappings. Negotiations for the Chibok girls' release proved difficult under Boko Haram's leader Abubakar Shekau. More than 100 of them still remain in captivity. But despite reports, Wednesday's release did not come free. Boko Haram definitely got something in return for waltzing back into Dapchi and dropping off the girls. The problem going forward is that this will encourage the IS-linked militants to once again raid another community and abduct another set of people. The Nigerian government might feel like it has averted the kind of global disrepute that plagued the administration of former President Goodluck Jonathan following its poor response to the kidnapping of the Chibok girls. But this is only a minor PR victory for President Muhammadu Buhari's administration. Boko Haram and its various factions suffered no losses on Wednesday and they will remain a scourge in Nigeria.

Undercover police inquiry head urged to goCampaigners walk out of the inquiry amid unhappiness at anonymity granted to undercover officers.7m7 minutes agoUK,"This video can not be played Phillippa Kaufmann QC Campaigners have walked out of a public inquiry into undercover policing, demanding that the chairman stand down or appoint a full panel. The inquiry was set up in 2015 to investigate claims of wrongdoing by forces in England and Wales. But campaigners are unhappy that ex-undercover officers were granted anonymity during the proceedings. Phillippa Kaufmann QC, representing campaigners, said core participants could not participate meaningfully. Police took 'squatters' rights on dead children's identities Undercover police inquiry: Can it get to the truth? Undercover inquiry: Why it matters At Wednesday's hearing, Ms Kaufmann read a statement on behalf of campaigners, criticising chairman Sir John Mitting and his decisions around the anonymity of officers. She said: ""If you don't get this right now, then so much of what has gone wrong with undercover operations will remain secret. ""I'm sorry to say this, we have the usual white middle class elderly gentleman whose life experiences are a million miles away from those who were spied upon."" Ms Kaufmann claimed that the reasoning for not releasing the names of certain police officers was ""scant and largely uninformative"" and said her clients asked chairman Sir John Mitting to recuse himself or to install a new panel. After the statement was read out, around 60 people, including alleged victims, campaigners and their legal teams, walked out of the Royal Courts of Justice. Baroness Doreen Lawrence has backed the walk out, accusing Sir John of preventing her from finding out who spied on her family as they sought justice for her murdered son, Stephen. The inquiry was launched in 2015 after allegations that Scotland Yard infiltrated the Stephen Lawrence campaign 20 years ago. In a statement, Baroness Lawrence, who could not attend court on Wednesday, accused Sir John of being influenced by his own publicly-stated ""old fashioned and naive views"". ""He is turning what should be a transparent, accountable and public hearing into an inquiry cloaked in secrecy and anonymity,"" she said. ""I want to know the names of the police officers who spied on me, my family and our campaign for justice. The chair is not allowing that, in my view, for reasons which are completely unjustifiable and unreasonable."" She called on Sir John to resign or for a panel to be appointed ""before any more public money is spent"", adding: ""Anything less than this will lead me to consider carefully whether I should continue to participate in this inquiry."" A woman known as Cathy, from campaign group Police Spies Out of Lives, said Sir John's appointment ""seems to give more weight to the privacy of the officers"" rather than the alleged victims. She said: ""We've all been disappointed at the slow rate of progress and the complete lack of disclosure."" ""There are two key questions. What were the cover names, and which groups were spied on? ""Without those two bits of information it's nigh-on impossible for people to come forward to say this is what happened to me and my group."" By Dominic Casciani, BBC home affairs correspondent The undercover inquiry is now three years old - and so far behind schedule that it was already meant to be delivering its final report to ministers. Instead it has become mired in a legal stand-off that this morning became personal with a remarkable attack on a High Court judge by a leading barrister. In the majority of anonymity applications that Sir John Mitting has so far assessed, he has been minded to protect officers' identities in some shape or form. He is adamant he can get to the bottom of wrongdoing - but campaigners say that's impossible unless they are told who the officers targeting political groups were. It is not remotely clear where the inquiry goes from here. One of the women that brought the court action against the Metropolitan Police said her experience of undercover policing ""completely ripped apart my life"". Helen Steel said she was ""deceived"" into a two-year relationship with an undercover police officer called John Dines, who she later discovered had infiltrated the London Greenpeace organisation in the 1980s. ""We lived together, we talked about planning a family and we talked about spending the rest of our lives together,"" she said. ""After a while he began acting strangely and seemed to go through a mental breakdown and then he disappeared."" He left home in 1992, and Ms Steel later found out that he had been using the identity of a dead child. Helen Steel had no idea her partner of two years was an undercover police officer who had infiltrated London Greenpeace The Undercover Policing Inquiry (UCPI),launched by the then-Home Secretary Theresa May, was due to finish this year, but has been beset by delays - including the death of its original chairman Sir Christopher Pitchford. It is expected to take another year before all the evidence is heard. The allegation being looked into by the inquiry is that undercover policing units that had developed over 40 years were out of control. Incidents included: Officers from the Metropolitan Police force's now disbanded Special Demonstration Squad (SDS) tricking women, whom they were targeting, into sexual relationships Some of them used the names of dead babies to create a cover story complete with birth records Some of these infiltrations led to proven miscarriages of justice The most toxic allegation that triggered the inquiry was that an officer infiltrated the Stephen Lawrence justice campaign Police took 'squatters' rights' on dead children's identities Undercover inquiry: Why it matters Undercover police inquiry to be held Death toll rises amid most destructive wildfire in Los Angeles' history Moment friends abandon house as Palisades fire closes in 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Why does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?

Facebook's biggest challenge yet,"Founder and CEO of Facebook Mark Zuckerberg has been summoned to appear before UK MPs This might be the biggest crisis Facebook has faced since its founding, and the company's initial response has not helped. The proposed departure of the company's data security chief, Alex Stamos, has spread anxiety through the company internationally, and it is being reported that this opened up already significant divisions within the company about just how transparent it should be. The leadership question goes higher, however, to Mark Zuckerberg. When it was first suggested that Russia may have used the platform to interfere in the 2016 election, Zuckerberg initially described that as a ""pretty crazy idea"". Months later he recanted, and announced a raft of measures to address the viral spread of disinformation. This time, following the dogged and undercover reporting ofChannel 4 News,external,The Observer,externalandThe New York Times,external, Facebook has responded with the bold assertion that tens of millions of people having their data scraped and passed on to a third party does not constitute a data breach. US consumer watchdog 'probes Facebook' How to protect your Facebook data Both Facebook and Cambridge Analytica deny any wrongdoing or breaking the law. And therein lies the rub. If this indeed isn't a data breach; if it doesn't strike these companies as a cause for alarm; and if what has happened is legal, then that might be the very reason that Facebook's users - all two billion of them - should be worried. Facebook has grown dizzyingly rich by operating what is in effect a mass surveillance tool. Most users have no idea just how much social media companies know about them. The business model that has made Facebook very rich is based on the quality of that data. Facebook uses that data to sell your attention to advertisers. Advertisers use smart messaging to influence behaviour, and try to get us to buy their products. As Hugo Rifkind wrote in The Times,external, what has happened now is that Facebook, the biggest and most powerful social media platform, has gone from selling mere products to selling politics, too. Political operatives, whether they be from democracies or not, also want to use smart messaging to influence behaviour, in order to get us to vote for a particular candidate, or to undermine a consensus and degrade the truth. A smart corporate response from Facebook would grant that the remarkable innovations and technology that have created its news feed, an often addictive and for now free product, are now being exploited for goals that are not always socially desirable. Instead the company's instinct was to alight on a technicality, and say this was no data breach, despite the fact that it suspended the accounts of Cambridge Analytica and its whistleblower, Chris Wylie. Now at last the company is stepping into gear, calling a meeting of all staff to address concerns and answer questions. Several different investigations on both sides of the Atlantic are now underway.Mark Zuckerberg may not want to appear before the DCMS Select Committee, but he will have to make a public pronouncement soon enough. Blog posts alone won't do. It must never be forgotten that, with all the zeal that has become customary in the world of superstar tech firms, Facebook executives talk about their company in missionary terms. We're on a mission, they say, to make the world more open and connected. There is a tension, then, between the liberal inclinations of some Facebook staff - though of course the company as a whole is politically neutral - and the fact that a British company on whose board Steve Bannon sits may have used the platform to help President Trump gain office. Of course, Cambridge Analytica's power could be wildly over-stated, and we don't yet know sufficient detail on Russian misbehaviour on the platform. There is a tension between the globalist outlook of a company that hires supremely clever graduates from around the world, and the more nationalist tendencies of the current White House administration. And there is a tension between the self-declared mission to champion openness, and the fact that Mark Zuckerberg, for reasons still unclear, seemed to be unavailable for comment as lawmakers demanded to hear from him. At some point, these tensions become unbearable. A month ago, I saidFacebook may have peaked, in influence if not in wealth. I wonder if Alex Stamos's departure will persuade some staff there of this thesis.

How to protect your data,"People increasingly want to know how much information tech firms have on them Allegations that research firm Cambridge Analytica misused the data of 50 million Facebook users have reopened the debate about how information on the social network is shared and with whom. Data is like oil to Facebook - it is what brings advertisers to the platform, who in turn make it money. And there is no question that Facebook has the ability to build detailed and sophisticated profiles on users' likes, dislikes, lifestyles and political leanings. The bigger question becomes - what does it share with others and what can users do to regain control of their information? Cambridge Analytica chief executive Alexander Nix told MPs it used data from ""Facebook surveys"" We've all seen these quizzes - offering to test your IQ, reveal your inner personality, or show you what you'd look like if you were a glamorous actor. It was information from one such Facebook quiz - This is Your Digital Life - that Cambridge Analytica is alleged to have used to harvest the data of millions of people. Many such quizzes come with reassurances that your data is safe. These games and quizzes are designed to tempt users in but they are often just a shop front for mass data collection - and one that Facebook's terms and conditions allow. Privacy advocates Electronic Frontier Foundation said the way these quizzes collected data reflected ""how Facebook's terms of service and API were structured at the time"". Facebook has changed its terms and conditions to cut down on the information that third parties can collect, specifically stopping them from accessing data about users' friends. It is not yet clear exactly what information the firm got hold of - this is now subject to an investigation by theUK data protection authority, the ICO. Log in to Facebook and visit the App settings page Click edit button under Apps, Websites and Plugins Disable platform App settings can be found via a drop down menu in blue bar at the top of Facebook page This will mean that you won't be able to use third-party sites on Facebook and if that is is a step too far, there is a way of limiting the personal information accessible by apps while still using them: Log into Facebook's App settings page Unclick every category you don't want the app to access, which includes bio, birthday, family, religious views, if you are online, posts on your timeline, activities and interests There are some others pieces of advice too. ""Never click on a 'like' button on a product service page and if you want to play these games and quizzes, don't log in through Facebook but go directly to the site,"" said Paul Bernal, a lecturer in Information Technology, Intellectual Property and Media Law in the University of East Anglia School of Law. ""Using Facebook Login is easy but doing so, grants the app's developer access to a range of information from their Facebook profiles,"" he added. Digital fingerprints are getting bigger as people share more information online There really is only one way to make sure data we create on a daily basis remains entirely private, thinks Dr Bernal. ""Leave Facebook."" ""The incentive Facebook will have to protect people more will only come if people start leaving. Currently it has very little incentive to change,"" he told the BBC. It seems he is not alone in his call -the hashtag #DeleteFacebook is now trending on Twitterin the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal. But Dr Bernal acknowledges that it is unlikely many will quit - especially those who see Facebook as ""part of the infrastructure of their lives"". The less drastic option is deactivation, which stops an account from appearing in search results but gives the user the option to bring it back.  It would stop future tracking but means all the information already collected will still be kept. For those that decide deletion is the best option, users can head to thedelete my account page,external, which explains that once gone, information cannot be retrieved. The page is not easy to find on the site and requires quite a few steps: From the top right of the blue bar, click the downward arrow Select settings Click General Click Manage Account Click Request Deletion In the pop-up box, which is aimed at people who want to delete their account in the event of their death, click Learn More Scroll down to the section headed Deleting Your Account and click on the link Facebook advises users who delete their account to download a copy of their information before they delete it. They also warn users that the process can take up to 90 days, during which time the information is inaccessible to others using the platform. Mr Schrems has been involved in a series of complaints against Facebook since 2011 Under current data protection rules, users can make a Subject Access Request to individual firms to find out how much information they have on them. When Austrian privacy advocate Max Schrems made such a request to Facebook in 2011, he was given a CD with 1,200 files stored on it. He found that the social network kept records of all the IP addresses of machines he used to access the site, a full history of messages and chats, his location and even items that he thought he had deleted, such as messages, status updates and wall posts. But in a world where Facebook information is shared more widely with third parties, making such a request gets harder. As Dr Bernal says: ""How do you ask for your data when you don't know who to ask?"" That is likely to change this summer with the introduction  of the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which aims to make it far easier for users to take back control of their data. The threat of big fines for firms that do not comply with such requests could make it more likely that they will share this information, which must be given to consumers ""in a clear and readable form"". Can you remove your profile from social media? Data protection laws in Europe suggest that firms should only keep user data ""as long as necessary"" but the interpretation of this can be very flexible. In Facebook's case, this means that as long as the person posting something does not delete it, it will remain online indefinitely. Users can delete their accounts, which in theory will ""kill"" all their past posts but Facebook encourages those who wish to take a break from the social network simply to deactivate them, in case they wish to return. And it must be remembered that a lot of information about you will remain on the platform, from the posts of your friends. One of the biggest changes of GDPR will be the right for people to be forgotten and, under these changes it should, in theory, be much easier to wipe your social network or other online history from existence.

IVF egg donor use 'doubles in a decade',"This video can not be played One woman who had her son through egg donation said it was the ""greatest gift"" The number of women using donated eggs has risen sharply in the past 10 years, latest figures show. In 2006 1,912 women had IVF using a donor egg, compared with 3,924 in 2016, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) said. It attributed the rise to a greater awareness of donation as an option, more donors, and more same sex couples, single and older women using them. The number of women donating their eggs is also on the increase. HFEA, the UK fertility industry's regulator, said there were 3,924 IVF treatment cycles in women using donated eggs in 2016. Of these, the largest group of women using donated eggs were those over 44 years old. Women usually need to be between 18 and 35 to donate their eggs and the process for donating is similar to the early stages of IVF, involving hormone injections and egg removal. 'I want to make families feel complete' Full IVF funding 'would reduce risk of harm' Five things you might not know about IVF The regulator said about one in three IVF treatment cycles resulted in a birth for patients under 35, with current treatments now 85% more likely to succeed than they were when records began in 1991. Chair Sally Cheshire said: ""There are more options these days for people to be able to create their own families. ""We have seen an increase in egg donation and sperm donation, and in people who use both. ""Generally there is a greater awareness of donation, we have seen a rise - about a third up - in same sex couples and single women coming forward for donation but it's important to say that they still represent a very small percentage of the number of IVF cycles that take place."" Under UK law, women cannot be paid for egg donation but can receive compensation of up to Â£750 per cycle to cover their expenses. Cathy Nicholson has donated her eggs five times Cathy Nicholson, from York, has donated her eggs five times, donating every year for five years since she was 27. She has helped a family where the woman had undergone cancer treatment, a same-sex couple and couples with fertility problems. The 38-year-old, who is expecting her third child in May, said: ""People that receive eggs are absolutely amazed that other women want to give them, but that is because at the end of their process they get this amazing baby. ""It's an involved process, it's a commitment, but really it is a drop in the ocean compared to what couples have to go through to make their babies possible. ""I didn't feel I was giving anything away that I was going to use for myself."" Amanda Mitcheson used an egg donor after struggling to conceive Amanda Mitcheson, 49, from Doncaster, started trying for a baby at 38 but she struggled to conceive and was told she had no egg reserves. She started IVF and went to America to find an egg donor, spending Â£30,000, but without success. She eventually used an egg donor from the UK and now has a four-year-old son, Max. ""It's the greatest gift that any woman can give to another,"" she said. ""People take it for granted they can have kids and when you find out you can't it's absolutely devastating. ""If Max wants to meet the donor when he's 18, in the same process as adoption, he can do that if he wishes and I'll support him in that,"" she said. An egg is removed from the woman's ovaries and fertilised with sperm in a laboratory The fertilised egg is then returned to the woman's womb to develop IVF worked for the first time on 10 November 1977. On 25 July 1978, the world's first IVF baby, Louise Brown, was born On average, IVF fails 70% of the time The highest success rates are for women under 35 On average, it takes almost four-and-a-half years to conceive with IVF Source: Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority/Fertility Network UK Alison Bagshawe founded egg donation facilitator Altrui in 2010 Altrui, in Hawes, North Yorkshire, is the only company in the UK to recruit egg donors. Founder Alison Bagshawe said: ""We get people who are on the bone marrow register, blood donor register, people who just genuinely want to help someone start a family. ""They may have actually seen a friend or family member struggling with fertility issues and it's that which gives them a trigger to find out more and come forward. ""It's extraordinary how many recipients we actually have coming to us who didn't even know they could have the help of an egg donor - that they've even got a finite number of eggs and there is a time clock ticking for them, so yes I think people are far more aware now. ""That's what has changed in the last five years or so, this general awareness that fertility is finite and you need to get on with it.""

The number of women donating their eggs is also on the increase. HFEA, the UK fertility industry's regulator, said there were 3,924 IVF treatment cycles in women using donated eggs in 2016. Of these, the largest group of women using donated eggs were those over 44 years old. Women usually need to be between 18 and 35 to donate their eggs and the process for donating is similar to the early stages of IVF, involving hormone injections and egg removal. 'I want to make families feel complete' Full IVF funding 'would reduce risk of harm' Five things you might not know about IVF The regulator said about one in three IVF treatment cycles resulted in a birth for patients under 35, with current treatments now 85% more likely to succeed than they were when records began in 1991. Chair Sally Cheshire said: ""There are more options these days for people to be able to create their own families. ""We have seen an increase in egg donation and sperm donation, and in people who use both. ""Generally there is a greater awareness of donation, we have seen a rise - about a third up - in same sex couples and single women coming forward for donation but it's important to say that they still represent a very small percentage of the number of IVF cycles that take place."" Under UK law, women cannot be paid for egg donation but can receive compensation of up to Â£750 per cycle to cover their expenses. Cathy Nicholson has donated her eggs five times Cathy Nicholson, from York, has donated her eggs five times, donating every year for five years since she was 27. She has helped a family where the woman had undergone cancer treatment, a same-sex couple and couples with fertility problems. The 38-year-old, who is expecting her third child in May, said: ""People that receive eggs are absolutely amazed that other women want to give them, but that is because at the end of their process they get this amazing baby. ""It's an involved process, it's a commitment, but really it is a drop in the ocean compared to what couples have to go through to make their babies possible. ""I didn't feel I was giving anything away that I was going to use for myself."" Amanda Mitcheson used an egg donor after struggling to conceive Amanda Mitcheson, 49, from Doncaster, started trying for a baby at 38 but she struggled to conceive and was told she had no egg reserves. She started IVF and went to America to find an egg donor, spending Â£30,000, but without success. She eventually used an egg donor from the UK and now has a four-year-old son, Max. ""It's the greatest gift that any woman can give to another,"" she said. ""People take it for granted they can have kids and when you find out you can't it's absolutely devastating. ""If Max wants to meet the donor when he's 18, in the same process as adoption, he can do that if he wishes and I'll support him in that,"" she said. An egg is removed from the woman's ovaries and fertilised with sperm in a laboratory The fertilised egg is then returned to the woman's womb to develop IVF worked for the first time on 10 November 1977. On 25 July 1978, the world's first IVF baby, Louise Brown, was born On average, IVF fails 70% of the time The highest success rates are for women under 35 On average, it takes almost four-and-a-half years to conceive with IVF Source: Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority/Fertility Network UK Alison Bagshawe founded egg donation facilitator Altrui in 2010 Altrui, in Hawes, North Yorkshire, is the only company in the UK to recruit egg donors. Founder Alison Bagshawe said: ""We get people who are on the bone marrow register, blood donor register, people who just genuinely want to help someone start a family. ""They may have actually seen a friend or family member struggling with fertility issues and it's that which gives them a trigger to find out more and come forward. ""It's extraordinary how many recipients we actually have coming to us who didn't even know they could have the help of an egg donor - that they've even got a finite number of eggs and there is a time clock ticking for them, so yes I think people are far more aware now. ""That's what has changed in the last five years or so, this general awareness that fertility is finite and you need to get on with it.""

Social media warning after child's death,"This video can not be played Tributes paid to two-year-old Kiara Moore Police are warning people not to post malicious comments on social media about the death of a two-year-old girl who died after a car went into a river. Kiara Moore was found in the River Teifi in Cardigan, Ceredigion, after she had been left in the Mini while it was parked on a slipway on Monday. Her motherposted on Facebookshe would feel guilty for the rest of her life. Dyfed-Powys Police asked people ""not to speculate"" on the circumstances. The force said: ""Posts considered to be malicious will be recorded and police action may follow."" An inquest was also opened into Kiara's death, and adjourned to a later date. Kiara's parents called the police at about 15:30 GMT on Monday after their silver Mini vanished from outside their business, Adventure Beyond, with her inside. They initially thought it had been stolen from the slipway, but it was later found in the river by emergency services. Police went into the water to rescue the girl and she was airlifted to hospital, but died. The little girl would have celebrated her third birthday next Tuesday. In a Facebook post on Monday, which has since been deleted, her mother Kim Rowlands said her ""beautiful baby girl"" had died, adding: ""Due to my own stupidity, I will have to live with the guilt of this for the rest of my life. ""Mummy loves you baby girl and I'm so sorry."" In a Facebook post, her father Jet Moore, said the pair had got in the car to go home when Kiara's mother had to go back into the business to get some money. He said: ""Went back to the office to get money from the desk and came back to no car. ""Looked in the river. No signs. So we thought she and the car had been taken."" In a tribute to his daughter he wrote: ""Unfortunately Kiara had an amazing but short life. ""She was an incredible happy young girl who lived I hope a great adventurous fun life. And may have done more than most people."" A tribute from Kiara's nursery Cylch Meithrin Drefach Felindre Coastguard rescue teams and the RNLI searched the River Teifi On Wednesday, Dyfed-Powys Police confirmed the vehicle had not been stolen. A force spokesman said: ""Enquiries are continuing to fully understand the circumstances surrounding this tragic incident. ""Examination of the vehicle will form part of these enquiries.

Boy sitting on dog advert cleared,"Adverts for the photo printing site Photobox have been cleared by a watchdog after it received 212 complaints. Viewers had expressed concern that the three ads, featuring scenes of a family barbeque with parents photographing a boy sitting on a Great Dane, could be harmful to the pet and the child. One complaint came from the RSPCA. Photobox said the boy and dog were filmed separately and ""at no point did the boy actually sit on the dog"". It added that a qualified vet had been present during filming, and provided a certificate to the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) as proof. The ASA said: ""We acknowledged the vet's certificate provided by Photobox and (ad clearance agency) Clearcast, and were content that the two dogs used for the ad were not harmed during production."" The certificate stated that the dogs, Kalifa and Mufasa, ""were never placed under any risk or suffered any damage during the shooting"". Narnia and Middle Earth appear on signs Mums' Down's syndrome video goes viral Mysterious Steve sighted in Scotland The ASA added that the advert would not be shown during children's programming, making it ""unlikely"" that children would emulate the pose and harm themselves or their pets. The footage was accompanied by a voice-over, which said: ""This pleasant get together shall soon be shattered for a photo storm brews.

"Kidnapped schoolgirls 'freed in Nigeria'A total of 76 out of the 110 girls were brought home to Dapchi on Wednesday, the government says.1han hour agoAfrica","A relieved man wipes away a tear after the girls, who went missing on 19 February, arrived back in Dapchi Nearly all of the 110 Nigerian schoolgirls kidnapped by militants in the town of Dapchi last month have been returned, the government says. Officials said at least 101 girls were reunited with their families after being brought back to the town. The girls were later flown to the capital, Abuja, where they were due to meet President Muhammadu Buhari. Reports suggest at least five girls died during their ordeal, and that a Christian girl remains captive. Who are Boko Haram? Dapchi families' heartbreak and despair One of the freed girls, in a phone conversation with a relative, said the five had been crushed to death as they were herded into vehicles and driven away. The girl said she and the others were taken into the bush, to an ""enclosed place"". When asked whether they were well fed, she said they had to cook their own food. The government did not make any mention of deaths, or otherwise explain the discrepancy between the 110 abducted and the 101 returned. There were scenes of celebration in Dapchi. The girls arrived in the town in the early hours of this morning One parent, Kundili Bukar, told the BBC the militants had driven into the town in a motorcade in the early hours of Wednesday morning and surrendered the girls to the community. Government officials indicated their relief. The government had been strongly criticised after the abduction on 19 February, amid reports that the military had pulled out of Dapchi the day before. Nigeria had already suffered the Chibok kidnapping, when 276 girls were snatched from a school in April 2014. More than 100 are still missing. Among those to witness the release of the Dapchi girls were some of the Chibok parents, who had gone to the town to console its residents on their loss. ""Our visit became something else,"" one of the Chibok mothers told Reuters news agency, adding that the scenes of reunion made her weep for the fate of her own daughter. The secret diaries of the Chibok girls What we know about Chibok kidnappings And while many parents celebrated, the father of one girl said she was being kept by the militants - thought to be from the Boko Haram group - because she refused to convert from Christianity to Islam. In a radio interview he said he was happy that she had not renounced her faith. The BBC's Tomi Oladipo says the government is likely to have given something in return for the girls' release. But Nigeria's Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, told Reuters that ""no ransom was paid"". Mr Lai Mohammed said the girls were taken to hospital in Dapchi, and they would be quarantined and offered psychological counselling before going back to school. However, one parent told the BBC the extremists had warned them not to send their daughters back to school, or they would be kidnapped again. By Tomi Oladipo, BBC Africa security correspondent The return of more than 70 Dapchi schoolgirls indicates that a Boko Haram faction, led by Abu Musab al-Barnawi, is taking a different approach to kidnappings. Negotiations for the Chibok girls' release proved difficult under Boko Haram's leader Abubakar Shekau. More than 100 of them still remain in captivity. But despite reports, Wednesday's release did not come free. Boko Haram definitely got something in return for waltzing back into Dapchi and dropping off the girls. The problem going forward is that this will encourage the IS-linked militants to once again raid another community and abduct another set of people. The Nigerian government might feel like it has averted the kind of global disrepute that plagued the administration of former President Goodluck Jonathan following its poor response to the kidnapping of the Chibok girls. But this is only a minor PR victory for President Muhammadu Buhari's administration. Boko Haram and its various factions suffered no losses on Wednesday and they will remain a scourge in Nigeria. Six questions about Nigeria's 'new Chibok' Nigeria mass girl kidnaps a 'disaster' Why January is Boko Haram's deadliest month Why reporting on Boko Haram is hard The woman standing up to Boko Haram.

"Pope Francis to visit Ireland in AugustPope Francis is to visit Ireland in August, the first papal visit to the country for almost 40 years.2m3 minutes agoEurope","Pope Francis will be the first pontiff to visit Ireland since 1979 Pope Francis is to visit Ireland in August - the first papal visit to the country for almost 40 years. He will arrive in Dublin as the city hosts the World Meeting of Families, an international Catholic event which is staged every three years. The last pontiff to visit the Republic of Ireland was Pope John Paul II.  He drew crowds of over 2.5m - more than half the state's population - in 1979. Memories of Pope John Paul II's visit to Ireland Millions of people came to see Pope John Paul II when he visited Ireland in 1979 Pope Francis will not be coming to Northern Ireland during the visit. The director of the Holy See Press Office confirmed to BBC News NI the Pope's schedule would not include a visit to Northern Ireland. Journalist Martin O'Brien, a columnist with The Irish Catholic newspaper, said the political impasse in Northern Ireland and the absence of a functioning executive were factors in the Pope's decision. Recent clerical sex abuse allegations against deceased priest Fr Malachy Finegan may also have been a factor in the decision, added Mr O'Brien. There had been previous speculation that he would visit north of the border,and Bishop Donal McKeown of Derry said he was very keen that such a trip could still be considered. Like John Paul II, Pope Francis will celebrate Mass in Dublin's Phoenix Park. He will also take part in the Festival of Families in Croke Park, the headquarters of the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA). It is one of the largest stadiums in Europe with a capacity of more than 82,000. The announcement, which was widely expected, has been welcomed by the Catholic bishops in Ireland and by the Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister), Leo Varadkar. Mr Varadkar said he looked forward to meeting the Pope. ""While it is not a formal state visit, it will be a major event for Ireland, with a high degree of public participation and a high international profile,"" he said. Pope John Paul II was the first pontiff to visit Ireland Pope Francis will arrive in a vastly changed and much more secular Ireland, with the church greatly diminished byclerical sex abuse scandals. It is anticipated there will be protests by victims' groups angry that the Church has yet to redress their grievances. Margaret McGuckin, who is leading calls for a special payment to child victims of abuse in Catholic residential homes in Northern Ireland, said the Pope has not done enough to help victims. ""I am sure there will be many of our survivor groups down south who will be protesting,"" she said. ""People could get quite angry and irate that the Pope is still coming, I don't think it is a good time for him to come here."" It was once considered among the most conservative countries in Europe, where the Catholic Church wielded great power and influence over the state authorities. Until the 1990s, homosexuality and divorce were illegal. Homosexuality was decriminalised in 1993 and the ban on divorce was removed by a referendum in 1995. In 2015, the Republic of Ireland became the first state in the world to make same-sex marriage legal by a popular vote.

Fatal Red Arrows crash inquiry continues,"Investigations are continuing into the cause of a Red Arrows jet crash which killed an engineer and left a pilot injured in hospital. The Hawk aircraft, which is used by the aerobatic display team, crashed at RAF Valley on Anglesey at about 13:30 GMT on Tuesday. Eyewitnesses said they only saw one person eject from the jet before it hit the ground and burst into flames. The RAF has described the incident as a ""tragic accident"". Profile: The Red Arrows Red Arrows engineer killed in jet crash North Wales Police said officers and crime scene investigators, supported by other specialists including the Defence Accident Investigation Branch are carrying out a joint investigation to find out what led up to and caused the ""tragic event"". On Wednesday, Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn sent their condolences to the family of the Red Arrows engineer who was killed. The prime minister told MPs at question time in the House of Commons: ""I am sure the whole house will also wish to join me in expressing our sincere condolences to the family and friends of the Red Arrows engineer who tragically died in the aircraft incident at RAF Valley yesterday."" The Labour leader added: ""I also join the prime minister in sending condolences to the family and friends of the Red Arrows engineer who sadly died yesterday and we wish the pilot well in his recovery.""

On Tuesday, eyewitnesses described hearing a loud explosion before they saw a ""ball of flames"" and lots of smoke. One woman said the aircraft ""did a loop"" and flew towards the runway, looking like it was about to land. Several people then described how they saw one person eject from the jet as it was quite low to the ground, before it crashed on the runway. The RAF said the jet was on a routine flight from RAF Valley to RAF Scampton, where the Red Arrows are based, after completing simulator training when it crashed.

Ocean plastic could treble in decade,"The amount of plastic in the ocean is set to triple in a decade unless litter is curbed, a major report has warned. Plastics is just one issue facing the world's seas, along with rising sea levels, warming oceans, and pollution, it says. But the Foresight Future of the Sea Report for the UK government said there are also opportunities to cash in on the ""ocean economy"". They say this is predicted to double to $3 trillion (Â£2 trillion) by 2030. The report says much more knowledge is needed about the ocean. The authors say the world needs a Mission to ""Planet Ocean"" to mirror the excitement of voyaging to the moon and Mars. The Foresight reports are written by experts to brief ministers on medium and long-term issues of significance. This one has been signed off by ministers from four different departments as the authors emphasise the need for a joined-up oceans policy. One of the authors, Prof Edward Hill from the UK National Oceanography Centre told BBC News: ""The ocean is critical to our economic future. Nine billion people will be looking to the ocean for more food. Yet we know so little of what's down there. ""We invest a lot of money and enthusiasm for missions to space - but there's nothing living out there. The sea bed is teeming with life. We really need a mission to planet ocean - it's the last frontier."" The report projects an increase in the industrial capture of fish Another of the authors, the chief scientist for the UK government's environment department Ian Boyd, agreed: ""The ocean is out of sight, out of mind,"" he said. He told BBC News: ""There's a continuous process of exploring for new things to exploit in the oceans,  and that's happening faster than we scientists can keep up with.  My suspicion is legislation is also struggling to keep up - and obviously there are risks in that."" He said offshore wind farms, oil industries and mining firms were spreading into unexplored areas. ""Scientists need to get in there faster than the commercial people or at least at the same time - to put proper regulation in place to govern those industries."" The report highlights many concerns, including the current worry about ocean plastic litter, which it forecasts will treble between 2015 and 2025. This video can not be played A giant build-up of plastic was captured by underwater photographer Caroline Power But it stresses that the ocean is being assailed from many different types of pollution - including run-off pesticides and fertilisers from farms, industrial toxins like PCBs, and pharmaceuticals. The authors say if governments can identify ways of protecting biodiversity in the seas, there are riches to be harvested - including nodules of metals and possibly even cures for cancer. They predict that the biggest industrial growth in the seas will come from offshore wind, followed by marine aquaculture and fish processing. The report also projects an increase in industrial capture of wild fish. This latter suggestion alarmed Rachel Jones, a marine expert  from London Zoo, ZSL. She told BBC News: ""Given that 90% of global fisheries are either at or in excess of sustainable catch levels, I can't really see how they are going to expand capture fisheries.""

Pope Francis to visit Ireland in August,"Pope Francis will be the first pontiff to visit Ireland since 1979 Pope Francis is to visit Ireland in August - the first papal visit to the country for almost 40 years. He will arrive in Dublin as the city hosts the World Meeting of Families, an international Catholic event which is staged every three years. The last pontiff to visit the Republic of Ireland was Pope John Paul II.  He drew crowds of over 2.5m - more than half the state's population - in 1979. Memories of Pope John Paul II's visit to Ireland Millions of people came to see Pope John Paul II when he visited Ireland in 1979 Pope Francis will not be coming to Northern Ireland during the visit. The director of the Holy See Press Office confirmed to BBC News NI the Pope's schedule would not include a visit to Northern Ireland. Journalist Martin O'Brien, a columnist with The Irish Catholic newspaper, said the political impasse in Northern Ireland and the absence of a functioning executive were factors in the Pope's decision. Recent clerical sex abuse allegations against deceased priest Fr Malachy Finegan may also have been a factor in the decision, added Mr O'Brien. There had been previous speculation that he would visit north of the border,and Bishop Donal McKeown of Derry said he was very keen that such a trip could still be considered. Like John Paul II, Pope Francis will celebrate Mass in Dublin's Phoenix Park. He will also take part in the Festival of Families in Croke Park, the headquarters of the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA). It is one of the largest stadiums in Europe with a capacity of more than 82,000. The announcement, which was widely expected, has been welcomed by the Catholic bishops in Ireland and by the Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister), Leo Varadkar. Mr Varadkar said he looked forward to meeting the Pope. ""While it is not a formal state visit, it will be a major event for Ireland, with a high degree of public participation and a high international profile,"" he said. Pope John Paul II was the first pontiff to visit Ireland Pope Francis will arrive in a vastly changed and much more secular Ireland, with the church greatly diminished byclerical sex abuse scandals. It is anticipated there will be protests by victims' groups angry that the Church has yet to redress their grievances. Margaret McGuckin, who is leading calls for a special payment to child victims of abuse in Catholic residential homes in Northern Ireland, said the Pope has not done enough to help victims. ""I am sure there will be many of our survivor groups down south who will be protesting,"" she said. ""People could get quite angry and irate that the Pope is still coming, I don't think it is a good time for him to come here."" It was once considered among the most conservative countries in Europe, where the Catholic Church wielded great power and influence over the state authorities. Until the 1990s, homosexuality and divorce were illegal. Homosexuality was decriminalised in 1993 and the ban on divorce was removed by a referendum in 1995. In 2015, the Republic of Ireland became the first state in the world to make same-sex marriage legal by a popular vote.

Israel hit Syria 'nuclear reactor' in 2007,"This video can not be played Israeli military video footage showing air strike on suspected Syrian nuclear reactor in 2007 Israel has for the first time confirmed that it destroyed a suspected nuclear reactor being built in Syria in 2007. The military said fighter jets bombed the al-Kibar facility in Deir al-Zour province,external, 450km (280 miles) north-east of Damascus, as it neared completion. Syria's government has repeatedly denied that it was building a reactor. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel was determined to prevent its enemies from obtaining nuclear weapons. ""The Israeli government, the Israel Defense Forces and the Mossad [intelligence services] prevented Syria from developing nuclear capability. They are worthy of full praise for this,"" he wrote on Twitter. ""Israel's policy was and remains consistent - to prevent our enemies from arming themselves with nuclear weapons."" In 1981, in a surprise attack, Israeli jets destroyed a nuclear reactor being constructed south-east of Baghdad by the Iraqi government of Saddam Hussein. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said a ""vast intelligence effort"" began in late 2004, when Israeli agents obtained information that foreign experts -believed to be North Korean,external- were helping Syria with a nuclear project. After the Israeli intelligence community located the building site and predicted that the nuclear reactor would turn operational by the end of 2007, the IDF made plans for an air strike dubbed ""Operation Outside the Box"". The US published photos in 2008 purportedly showing the reactor under construction At 22:30 on 5 September 2007, F-16 and F-15 jets took off from two bases in southern Israel and flew towards Deir al-Zour, via the Mediterranean Sea and the Syrian-Turkish border. The jets returned four hours later, after conducting a strike that totally disabled the reactor and caused irreversible damage, according to the IDF. The IDF said it was decided not to confirm the strike or publish any information afterwards ""in light of the highly sensitive security situation"". Israel admits air strike on Syria,external Satellite images of alleged Syrian nuclear site,external Syria 'had covert nuclear scheme',external The Syrian military did not retaliate after the attack. President Bashar al-Assad said only that Israel had ""bombed buildings and construction related to the military"", which were ""not used"". The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) concluded in 2011 thatthe site was ""very likely"" to have been a nuclear reactor. Syria had signed the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) before the strike, which gave it the right to build a reactor to generate electricity. But it was also obliged to notify the IAEA of any plans to construct a nuclear facility. Israel, which is not a signatory to the NPT, is widely believed to have a nuclear arsenal - though it has neither confirmed nor denied this. The IDF also noted that Islamic State (IS) militants fighting in Syria's civil war seized control of Deir al-Zour in 2014. ""One could only imagine how much havoc they could have wreaked with a nuclear facility in their hands,"" it said. By Tom Bateman, BBC News, Jerusalem It was never in any real doubt that Israel was behind the strike on the al-Kibar facility in the Syrian desert a decade ago. What matters about today's confirmation is its timing and the vivid way in which the Israeli military has chosen to publicise it. The message being projected via the black-and-white pictures from the planes' cockpits is this: that Israel would be prepared to put Iranian nuclear facilities in the planes' crosshairs in the future. Israel accuses Iran of maintaining nuclear ambitions - amounting to an existential threat - and believes its forces are trying to establish themselves permanently over its northern border in Syria - a claim Iran rejects. The country may hope to add a sharper military edge to American diplomatic pressure on Europe to toughen its stance on the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and six world powers - an agreement detested by Israel. But it is a move that once again raises the stakes in the volatile atmosphere among regional powers engaged in Syria's seven-year long war. Israel has carried out at least 100 clandestine air strikes in Syria since 2011. Many of the raids are believed to have been aimed at preventing transfers of advanced weapons from Iran to Lebanon's Hezbollah movement, which fought a war with Israel in 2006. Israel has carried out at least 100 clandestine air strikes in Syria since the civil war began Iran and Hezbollah are key allies of President Assad, and their forces have helped turned the tide of the civil war decisively in his favour. Israeli aircraft are also said to have struck Syrian and Iranian military facilities inside Syria, but officials usually do not confirm such reports. One exception was in February, when Israel announced that it had attacked eight Syrian and four Iranian targets. The strikes came after Israel shot down an Iranian drone that had violated its airspace, and an Israeli F-16 crashed in Israel after being hit by Syrian anti-aircraft fire during a raid on the drone's launch site.

Austin bombings suspect dead - US media,"This video can not be played ""The suspect is deceased,"" says police chief Brian Manley A suspect linked with a series of deadly parcel bombs targeting the Texan city of Austin is dead after a major police operation, officials say. The man was killed after detonating a device when officers approached his car off a highway in the city of Round Rock, north of the state capital. He has been named by US media as Mark Anthony Conditt, aged 23. The incident follows four bomb attacks in Austin and one in Schertz, 65 miles (104km) south. Late on Tuesday, the Austin police department used footage from a FedEx store in south Austin, the scene of the latest parcel bomb explosion, to identify the male suspect. After using the Google search engine to gather information on the suspect's online browsing history, which showed searches on facilities which were used to ship packages, authorities later managed to locate his vehicle. In the early hours of Wednesday, local and federal officers then took up positions around a parking area belonging to a hotel in Round Rock, about 20 miles (32km) north of Austin. As they waited for tactical teams to arrive, the vehicle started to drive away, and officers pursued it. When the vehicle drove into a ditch, armed officers approached, hoping to take the suspect into custody alive. But the driver then detonated a bomb, injuring one officer. Another officer opened fire.

Police later confirmed that the blast had killed the suspect. Austin police chief Brian Manley said that local residents should ""remain vigilant"", and urged anyone who noticed a suspicious package to contact the authorities. ""We don't know where the suspect has been over this past 24 hours,"" he said, adding that it was possible that additional devices may have been distributed. ""We do not understand what motivated him to do what he did,"" Chief Manley added. Mr Manley also praised his colleagues in a tweet. ""I can't thank the men and women of #AustinPD or our Federal partners enough for their tireless work in restoring peace to our community,"" he said. Earlier, CCTV images of a ""person of interest"" were shared on US media showing a white male with blond hair carrying a number of large packages at a FedEx store in Austin. Allow Twitter content?

Austin has been on edge amid the attacks, which have led to the deployment of hundreds of police officers in the city. Two people have been killed and six injured in the bombings. Police have not formally identified the suspect, who has been named in US media as Mark Anthony Conditt, aged 23. Texas Governor Greg Abbot told Fox News that he lived with two flatmates in Pflugerville, a suburb of Austin. ""Those two roommates have been talking to law enforcement,"" Mr Abbott said, adding they are not suspected of any crimes. The governor added that the suspect did not destroy his online footprint, which may provide investigators with a ""treasure trove of information that should shed light on who he is, what he did, and why he was doing it"". According to the Austin Statesman newspaper Mr Conditt graduated from the  Austin Community College after he was homeschooled by his mother during his high school years. The newspaper reports that he had worked for Crux Semiconductor in Austin as a ""purchasing Agent/buyer/shipping and receiving"", citing a profile on a job recruiting website. This video can not be played Texas explosions: What we know about bombings By Gary O'Donoghue, BBC News, Austin This was a dramatic denouement to a three-week reign of terror. It was only in the past 36 hours or so that police really got a handle on the possible identity of the suspect, who had foxed them for weeks by changing the nature of his targets and his method of operation. But the sheer number of devices - six in all - in such a short period of time may have been one factor that eventually led to his pursuit and apparent suicide. Another crucial factor was the one device that didn't go off. That gave police key leads and allowed them to isolate CCTV evidence of the suspect dropping off one of the devices at a FedEx office. As police continue to gather evidence at the scene, motivation will be the question on everyone's lips in Texas. And while this might feel like it's over, the admission from police that they don't know where the suspect was for the past day means more devices could be out there and it is too soon for Austin to completely relax. Authorities have said that a series of blasts that began in Austin in early March - involving package bombs and a tripwire - were all related: 2 March:A device explodes at Anthony Stephan House's home in Austin, killing the 39-year-old man 13 March:Draylen William Mason, 17, is killedand his mother is critically injured after he brings a package inside his home from the doorstep in Austin 13 March:Hours later, a 75-year-old Hispanic woman, who has not been named, is injured by another package in the state capital 18 March:A device injures two men who may have set off a tripwire while walking along a street in Austin 20 March:A parcel bomb explodes at a FedEx depot in Schertz, slightly injuring one person.

Tens of thousands missing pension perks,"As many as 90,000 grandparents and family members are missing out on a little-known perk that can increase their State Pension. National Insurance Credits for those who look after young children can be worth up to Â£230 a year in retirement. Insurance firm Royal London said 90% of those eligible were failing to claim the perk, known asAdult Specified Childcare Credit,external. It is for family members who look after their relatives' children. Parents or main carers can claim National Insurance Credits under a separate scheme. In the year to September 2017 there were 9,486 applications for the credit. However, that was a significant increase on the previous year, following an awareness campaign. Royal London obtained the figures under the Freedom of Information Act from HM Customs and Revenue (HMRC). Under the rules, any family member who looks after a child under 12 can make a claim, if the child's main carer or parent is working. They also have to be of working age. Many claimants are grandparents. Anyone wanting to make a claim can applyhere,external. Grandparents missing out on pension perks As with parents who stop work to care for children, National Insurance (NI) credits make up for gaps in contributions. Workers now need to have 35 years of NI contributions to claim the full State Pension. Some carers, and those out of work, can also claim NI credits. ""This National Insurance credit is a valuable right, and it is good news that the numbers claiming have risen so dramatically in such a short space of time,"" said Steve Webb, Royal London's policy director. ""But we believe that there are tens of thousands more grandparents who could be entitled to benefit, and we would encourage more of them to find out about the scheme and to make a claim."" The Department for Works and Pensions (DWP) advised people to get to know their pension, and find out what they may be entitled to. Parents who claim Child Benefit automatically receive NI credits while they have a child under 12.

MPs warn of obstacles to EU security deal,"A longer transition period after Brexit may be needed to guarantee continued security co-operation, MPs have said. The Commons Home Affairs Committee said the UK and EU should remain open to extending the transition phase after the UK's exit beyond December 2020. It warned the EU against limiting co-operation to existing law enforcement and intelligence sharing and said the UK must go beyond its own ""red lines"". Theresa May wants a new security treaty to take effect at the start of 2021. The UK's decision to leave the EU in March 2019, following the 2016 referendum vote, has called into question its future participation in EU-wide crime-fighting bodies such as Europol and law enforcement agreements such as the European Arrest Warrant extradition scheme. UK and EU agree Brexit transition terms 'Extend transition' call divides MPs The government has said it wants a new special security partnership with the EU which will maintain the existing level of co-operation on tackling serious crime and terrorism. In a new report, the cross-party committee welcomed efforts to replicate current ties on Europol, the European Arrest Warrant and data sharing, but warned of complex legal and technical barriers in the way. It said the UK should not assume that because it played a leading role in Europol and in intelligence-led policing on the continent that it would secure a more far-reaching deal than the EU has with other countries. ""This attitude, along with lack of planning for alternative scenarios, suggests that the government is at risk of sleep-walking into a highly detrimental outcome,"" it said. May urges new EU security deal by 2019 UK reveals proposed EU security deal Yvette Cooper, the Labour MP who chairs the committee, said ""just because we all want something, it doesn't mean it will happen, unless enough work is put in in time to overcome the genuine legal, constitutional and political obstacles we have uncovered"". The EU and UK have agreed, in principle, to a time-limited transition or implementation period that will last until the end of 2020 - during which the UK will abide by EU rules and regulations. The government said both sides were committed to maintaining ""deep levels"" of co-operation after Brexit and that it expected formal negotiations on a new security partnership to begin soon. ""The draft agreement reached with the European Commission earlier this week means security cooperation with the EU can continue through the implementation period up to December 2020,"" a spokesman said. ""We will be looking to secure a comprehensive new treaty on internal security co-operation that can begin directly after.""

Latest Austin incident not a bomb - police,"This video can not be played Texas explosions: The search for the suspect The reported explosion on Tuesday evening that injured one man in a charity shop in Austin, Texas, was an incendiary device - not a package bomb, police say. The authorities say it not is related to a series of recent parcel bombs in the area that have killed two people. Instead an old military device donated to the store detonated. The authorities have said the earlier blasts - involving package bombs and a tripwire - were all related. President Donald Trump said ""a very, very sick individual, or maybe individuals"" carried out those blasts and pledged justice for the victims. The city has been on edge after the attacks, and hundreds of police have been deployed to the area to investigate. The Austin fire department said a man in his thirties received ""potentially serious"" injuries in the explosion at the Goodwill charity shop on Brodie Lane. Allow Twitter content?

At a special media briefing, police confirmed the incident happened at about 19:00 local time (00:00 GMT Wednesday). They said one of the shop's employees had found a box, which looked like a ""military-type ordnance"" or an ""artillery simulator"". The employee then asked another member of staff to get rid of the box. But the latter ""initiated"" it, causing the incident. The unnamed member of staff was now ""recovering well"", the police said.

Pay rise for million NHS staff expected,"Nurses will be among more than one million staff to benefit from the three-year pay increase More than one million NHS staff, including nurses, porters and paramedics, are being offered increases of at least 6.5% over three years - with some getting as much as 29%. The deal has been formally agreed by union leaders and ministers on Wednesday and will cost Â£4.2bn. Staff will now be asked to vote on the deal, with rises backdated to April if they agree by the summer. The deal is tiered with the lowest-paid in each job receiving the biggest rise. The agreement covers all staff on the Agenda for Change contract - about 1.3m across the UK - which is the entire workforce with the exception of doctors, dentists and senior leaders. The agreement is complex. It means that: half will get a 6.5% pay rise over three years the other half will receive rises of between 9% and 29% because they are not at the top of their pay bands the lowest full-time salary - paid to the likes of cleaners, porters and catering staff - will rise by 15% to more than Â£18,000 these groups will get an immediate Â£2,000 rise this year a nurse with one year's experience would see their basic pay rise by 21% over three years, giving them a salary of up to Â£27,400 the deal includes a commitment on both sides to reduce the high rate of sickness absence in the NHS Sara Gorton, lead negotiator for the health unions, said: ""It won't solve every problem in the NHS but it will go a long way towards making dedicated health staff feel more valued, lift flagging morale and help turn the tide on staffing problems."" Danny Mortimer, chief executive of NHS Employers, said ""compromises"" have had to be made but he predicts the deal will make the NHS a ""desirable"" employer once again. NHS workers demand 3.9% pay rise NHS at 70: what are your NHS memories? The unions, which represent staff from all over the UK, have been in talks with English negotiators. The deal will now be put to staff in England with the results of that consultation expected by July. If they agree it will be backdated to April. Twelve health unions have backed the deal, but the GMB has not. GMB national officer Kevin Brandstatter said the deal promised ""jam tomorrow"" and did not do enough to make up for the squeeze on pay since 2010. ""Long-serving, dedicated health service workers have had thousands of pounds swiped from their pay packets since 2010 by the government's cruel and unnecessary pay cap."" It will be up to the devolved governments to decide whether to implement the deal outside England. Scotland has already given its lowest-paid staff bigger rises, so there could be some divergence in how the terms are introduced elsewhere. Want to join the debate? Here's our NHS group - let us know what you think.,external When the unions entered talks, they were asking for 3.9% a year. Under the deal agreed on Wednesday, pay will increase by 3% in the first year, but the future years will see smaller rises. Once you take into account inflation - forecast to be 2.4% in 2018, then 1.8% and 1.9% in the following two years - it is likely the rises will be fairly small in real terms. But what is important - for the unions at least - is that many will get much more. How much depends on where individual staff are on their pay bands. NHS pay is split into nine bands, each with quite broad ranges. Those at the very bottom of their pay bands could get up to 29%. Those close to the top are likely to get in the region of 9%. Tracey Budding will only get 6.5% more over three years as she is at the top of her pay band Tracey Budding works as a senior nurse in a neonatal intensive care unit and is an active member of the Royal College of Nursing. She is at the top of her pay band so will only get the 6.5% minimum. But she is backing the offer. ""It is a good deal,"" she says. ""It recognises the fact we have not been getting the pay rises we should have. ""It makes it easier for nurses to move up the pay bands and that in turn should help attract and retain nurses."" The government first announced it would lift the public-sector1% pay cap in September for police and prison officers,and then followed that with a promise in the Budget that NHS pay would be looked at, lifting the 1% cap a year early. The NHS has been under pressure to retain staff, after it was revealed that one in 10 nurses was leaving the public sector in England every year. The Royal College of Nursing claims average pay for nurses has fallen by more than14% in real terms since 2010. Statistics obtained by the BBC from NHS Digital showed 33,000 nurses walked away in 2017,piling pressure on understaffed hospitals and community services. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the cost of the rise would be covered by the Treasury rather than coming out of the NHS budget. ""The agreement reflects public appreciation for just how much they have done and continue to do,"" he added.

US consumer watchdog 'probes Facebook',"This video can not be played Mark Zuckerberg's 2009 BBC interview The US Federal Trade Commission is reported to be investigating Facebook after allegations that 50 million users' private information was misused by a political consultancy firm. Cambridge Analytica (CA), hired by the Trump campaign in the 2016 US election, has been accused of taking the personal data unknown to users. CA headAlexander Nix has now been suspended by the company board. The move came amid allegations the firm may have broken US electoral law. CA, which is based in London, denies any wrongdoing. Meanwhile,Facebook's stock has continued to slide, following a steep decline on Monday. The British and European parliaments have called on Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg to give evidence to them., and the social network is due to brief congressional aides on Wednesday. Mr Zuckerberg did not attend a Facebook staff briefing on the crisis at its Californian headquarters on Tuesday,external, which was led by deputy general counsel Paul Grewal instead, the Daily Beast news site reports .Where is Mark Zuckerberg? The global reach of Cambridge Analytica Cambridge Analytica: The story so far By Dave Lee, North America Technology Reporter, BBC News The criticisms of Facebook, and in particular Mark Zuckerberg, have never been louder or angrier. Employees at the company were addressed this morning not by their chief executive, but by one of the company's top lawyers. A Facebook spokeswoman said both Mr Zuckerberg and his deputy Sheryl Sandberg were too busy to address staff themselves. The firm added it was ""outraged to be deceived"" by Cambridge Analytica. A sign, perhaps, that Facebook is doubling down on the view that it is the victim. On Wednesday Facebook will send representatives to Washington to answer to Congress - the first step on what is set to be something of a world tour of explaining to investigators how on Earth this activity was able to happen. The loss to Facebook's value has been more than $60bn (Â£43bn) since this news broke. The wider impact for Silicon Valley is that it seems the era of tech companies essentially regulating themselves is perhaps coming to a dramatic end. The FTC is an independent agency of the US government tasked with protecting American consumers. It is investigating whether Facebook violated the terms of a 2011 decree regarding the social network's privacy protections,external, an unnamed source ""familiar with the agency's thinking and not authorised to speak on the record"" told the Washington Post newspaper. This was confirmed by a Bloomberg news agency report,external, quoting an unnamed ""person familiar with the matter"". Under the 2011 decree, Facebook must notify users and obtain their permission before data about them is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established, the Washington Post says. Facebook was also subjected to 20 years of privacy checkups to ensure compliance. Facebook confirmed on Tuesday that it was expecting to receive a letter from the FTC with questions about the data acquired by CA. However, it also said it had had no indication of a formal investigation, Reuters news agency reports. ""We remain strongly committed to protecting people's information,"" Facebook deputy chief privacy officer Rob Sherman said. ""We appreciate the opportunity to answer questions the FTC may have."" In its statement on Tuesday, it said:  ""The entire company is outraged we were deceived. We are committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people's information and will take whatever steps are required to see that this happens."" How to protect your Facebook data Facebook data sharing - time to act? Christopher Wylie, who worked with the consultancy firm, alleges that it amassed large amounts of data through a personality quiz on Facebook called This is Your Digital Life. This video can not be played Alexander Nix, CEO of Cambridge Analytica, was filmed by undercover reporters for Channel 4 News He says that 270,000 people took the quiz but the data of some 50 million users, mainly in the US, was harvested without their explicit consent via their friend networks. Mr Wylie says that data was sold to CA, which then used it to psychologically profile people and deliver pro-Trump material to them, with a view to influencing the outcome of the 2016 election. CA insists it followed the correct procedures in obtaining and using data - but it was suspended from Facebook last week. Channel 4 News, which conducted an undercover investigation into the consultancy firm, reports that it may have broken US electoral law, which prohibits co-ordination between an official election campaign and outside groups, or ""Super PACs"". Alexander Nix could be seen leaving his London offices through the back door on Tuesday CA executives were filmed discussing a twin-track strategy to campaigning,external, putting out positive messages through Donald Trump's official presidential campaign, while attack ads were promoted by outside organisations. Boasting about CA's work for the Trump campaign, Mr Nix told the undercover team: ""We did all the research, all the data, all the analytics, all the targeting. We ran all the digital campaign, the television campaign and our data informed all the strategy."" At the same time, CA managing director Mark Turnbull appeared to confirm for the undercover team that CA had created the Defeat Crooked Hillary brand of attack ads, funded by a super-PAC called Make America Number 1. The firm has denied wrongdoing, saying they operated according to a strict firewall and that  they were transparent about their activities. There are a few things to be aware of if you want to restrict who has access to your data: Keep an eye on apps, especially those which require you to log in using your Facebook account - they often have a very wide range of permissions and many are specifically designed to pick up your data Use an ad blocker to limit advertising Look at your Facebook security settings and make sure you are aware of what is enabled. Check the individual app settings to see whether you have given them permission to view your friends as well as yourself. You can download a copy of the data Facebook holds on you, although it is not comprehensive. There is a download button at the bottom of the General Account Settings tab. However bear in mind that your data may be less secure sitting on your laptop than it is on Facebook's servers, if your device is hacked. You can of course, simply leave Facebook, but the campaign group Privacy International warns that privacy concerns extend beyond the social network. ""The current focus is on protecting your data being exploited by third parties, but your data is being exploited all the time,"" said a spokeswoman. ""Many apps on your phone will have permission to access location data, your entire phone book and so on. It is just the tip of the iceberg.""

Where is Mark Zuckerberg?,"Founder and CEO of Facebook Mark Zuckerberg has been summoned to appear before UK MPs This might be the biggest crisis Facebook has faced since its founding, and the company's initial response has not helped. The proposed departure of the company's data security chief, Alex Stamos, has spread anxiety through the company internationally, and it is being reported that this opened up already significant divisions within the company about just how transparent it should be. The leadership question goes higher, however, to Mark Zuckerberg. When it was first suggested that Russia may have used the platform to interfere in the 2016 election, Zuckerberg initially described that as a ""pretty crazy idea"". Months later he recanted, and announced a raft of measures to address the viral spread of disinformation. This time, following the dogged and undercover reporting ofChannel 4 News,external,The Observer,externalandThe New York Times,external, Facebook has responded with the bold assertion that tens of millions of people having their data scraped and passed on to a third party does not constitute a data breach. US consumer watchdog 'probes Facebook' How to protect your Facebook data Both Facebook and Cambridge Analytica deny any wrongdoing or breaking the law. And therein lies the rub. If this indeed isn't a data breach; if it doesn't strike these companies as a cause for alarm; and if what has happened is legal, then that might be the very reason that Facebook's users - all two billion of them - should be worried. Facebook has grown dizzyingly rich by operating what is in effect a mass surveillance tool. Most users have no idea just how much social media companies know about them. The business model that has made Facebook very rich is based on the quality of that data. Facebook uses that data to sell your attention to advertisers. Advertisers use smart messaging to influence behaviour, and try to get us to buy their products. As Hugo Rifkind wrote in The Times,external, what has happened now is that Facebook, the biggest and most powerful social media platform, has gone from selling mere products to selling politics, too. Political operatives, whether they be from democracies or not, also want to use smart messaging to influence behaviour, in order to get us to vote for a particular candidate, or to undermine a consensus and degrade the truth. A smart corporate response from Facebook would grant that the remarkable innovations and technology that have created its news feed, an often addictive and for now free product, are now being exploited for goals that are not always socially desirable. Instead the company's instinct was to alight on a technicality, and say this was no data breach, despite the fact that it suspended the accounts of Cambridge Analytica and its whistleblower, Chris Wylie. Now at last the company is stepping into gear, calling a meeting of all staff to address concerns and answer questions. Several different investigations on both sides of the Atlantic are now underway.Mark Zuckerberg may not want to appear before the DCMS Select Committee, but he will have to make a public pronouncement soon enough. Blog posts alone won't do. It must never be forgotten that, with all the zeal that has become customary in the world of superstar tech firms, Facebook executives talk about their company in missionary terms. We're on a mission, they say, to make the world more open and connected. There is a tension, then, between the liberal inclinations of some Facebook staff - though of course the company as a whole is politically neutral - and the fact that a British company on whose board Steve Bannon sits may have used the platform to help President Trump gain office. Of course, Cambridge Analytica's power could be wildly over-stated, and we don't yet know sufficient detail on Russian misbehaviour on the platform. There is a tension between the globalist outlook of a company that hires supremely clever graduates from around the world, and the more nationalist tendencies of the current White House administration. And there is a tension between the self-declared mission to champion openness, and the fact that Mark Zuckerberg, for reasons still unclear, seemed to be unavailable for comment as lawmakers demanded to hear from him. At some point, these tensions become unbearable. A month ago, I saidFacebook may have peaked, in influence if not in wealth. I wonder if Alex Stamos's departure will persuade some staff there of this thesis.

Cambridge Analytica's Kenyan role queried,"Cambridge Analytica say they played a massive role in the election of Kenya's President Uhuru Kenyatta, left, who beat Raila Odinga, right, last year A full investigation must be carried out into a UK consultancy firm which helped take Kenya's President Uhuru Kenyatta to victory, the main opposition coalition has told the BBC. National Super Alliance (Nasa) official Norman Magaya accused Cambridge Analytica and the ruling party of trying to ""subvert the people's will"". Cambridge Analytica bosses were apparently caught on camera boasting of the control they had exerted in Kenya. The company denies any wrongdoing. Mr Kenyatta's Jubilee party have downplayed the impact of the group, saying they employed the company's parent company, SCL, to help with branding. Jubilee vice-chairman David Murathe told news agency Reuters: ""They were basically branding and all that but not directly."" How Trump data firm played a role in Kenyan elections Africa Live: For all the latest news from around the continent Cambridge Analytica first hit the headlines after helping US President Donald Trump to his shock win in 2016. However,questions are now being raised around the world over its methods- including the use of data harvested from people's Facebook pages. Before they helped Mr Trump, however, the company was active in Kenya, using the work it says it did during the 2013 election as one of its case studies. According to the website, it conducted a ""large-scale research project"", sampling 47,000 people, which provided a profile including things like ""key national and local political issues, levels of trust in key politicians, voting behaviours/intentions, and preferred information channels"". This video can not be played Alexander Nix, CEO, Cambridge Analytica: ""These sort of tactics are very effective"" They then ""devised an online social media campaign to generate a hugely active online following"". It does not mention the party by name. However, footage obtained byChannel 4 News,externalfollowing a months-long investigation appears to show Mark Turnbull - the managing director of the company's political arm - speaking about their work during the 2013 and 107 campaigns, and boasting of having ""staged the whole thing"". ""We have rebranded the entire party twice, written the manifesto, done research, analysis, messaging,"" he said. ""I think we wrote all the speeches and we staged the whole thing - so just about every element of this candidate."" They were also caught on camera apparently saying they could use bribes, former spies and Ukrainian sex workers to entrap politicians around the world - allegations the company has strongly denied, saying it was entrapped by the investigators. The conflicting accounts mean exactly what role Cambridge Analytica played in Kenya is unclear. In a statement addressing Monday's broadcast, the company said: ""Like any marketing agency, Cambridge Analytica uses social media platforms for placing paid advertisements and organic content. Influencer marketing and building grassroots networks on social media are both common activities for a modern political campaign."" But Mr Magaya said it was all hugely worrying, raising concerns over how data and potentially ""very toxic propaganda"" which swept through Kenyan social media may have been used by Cambridge Analytica and their client to influence the outcome of the election. ""This was a criminal enterprise which clearly wanted to subvert the will of the people - through manipulation, through propaganda,"" he told the BBC, as he called on both the US and UK to act to assist the investigation. ""There must be criminal culpability."" Senior figures in the opposition want a full investigation Last year's Kenyan election was already mired in controversy, after the initial vote in August was annulled after the Supreme Court found irregularities. Nasa presidential candidate Raila Odinga - who initially won 45% of the vote to Mr Kenyatta's 54% - then refused to stand in the re-run amid concerns the system would not have been properly reformed. Mr Odinga and Mr Kenyatta have recently made efforts to heal their differences. However, Mr Magaya pointed out the long-term effect of a negative campaign could be very damaging in a country like Kenya. ""Coming on the ashes of the 2008 post-election violence, that took an ethnic angle, such propaganda could create divisions which will take many generations to heal,"" he said. ""There must be nothing short of electoral justice as a way of putting the ghosts of the 2017 election [to rest]."" Yet Jubilee senator Kipchumba Murkomen suggested the reach of such a social media campaign would be limited in Kenya. ""Those things don't influence elections in Kenya,"" he told Reuters. ""Kenya is not America. In Kenya, vernacular radio stations are more influential than those things.""

Two thirds of firms yet to report pay gap,"Time's almost up for the UK's biggest companies to publish their gender pay gap, but so far only a third have done so. Two weeks before the deadline, more than 6,000 companies have not disclosed the average difference between what they pay male and female employees. Noncompliant companies face legal action, the government has warned. The CBI says it's difficult for some firms to compile the data, and that smaller companies need more support. Want to find out the gender pay gap at your company? Try the calculator below. Sorry, your browser does not support this lookup       If you can't see the calculator,click here,external. The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) says it will be ""fully enforcing"" the pay gap legislation and will write to companies that do not report by the deadline. Firms could face an unlimited fine if they continue to fail to publish the figures. What is the gender pay gap? Equality campaign group the Fawcett Society said it should be easier for the EHRC to use its powers. ""Government must make the Equalities and Human Rights Commission's enforcement powers stronger by changing the law,"" Fawcett Society chief executive Sam Smethers said. The Commission should have civil enforcement powers similar to HMRC, which has theability to fine firms for minimum wage transgressionsmore quickly, she added. Most firms pay men more than women. More than three quarters of organisations that have published have a gender pay gap. About 14% pay women more on average than men, while 8% said they have no pay gap at all. Some of the biggest pay gaps are in aviation and financial services.Jet2.com, Thomson Airways, TUI airways and Easyjet all have median pay gaps between 45% and 50%, which many of them attribute to the prevalence of male pilots. The finance and insurance sectorhas the biggest average gap of 35.6%,,externalaccording to the ONS. Brenda Trenowden is global chair of the 30% Club, which aims to increase the number of women on boards. She said revealing pay gap figures is not a ""quick fix"" to solving complex issues of equality and representation in the workplace. ""Rather than just talking about the shocking extent of the gender pay gap, we need to focus on what companies need to do to overcome the structural imbalance behind it,"" she said. ""There are a combination of factors - including better management of women, appropriate senior role models, and breaking down the gender bias - which need to be implemented as basic steps towards achieving this. ""There is far too much sensationalism and blame around this topic. We need constructive comment around why the gap exists and what can be done to overcome it."" Neil Carberry, of business lobby group the CBI, said these figures are of not much use in a vacuum. The business industry group is encouraging its members to publish an action plan alongside their figures in order to ""make sure the transparency means something,"" he said. He added that the UK will see a ""significant surge"" in reporting over the next two weeks but added ""it's a complex task, especially for those [firms] just over the threshold"". ""I expect non-reporting will cluster around the smaller end of the reporting group and a good policy would be to help these companies, rather than smack them over the head with a big stick,"" Mr Carberry said. Want to learn more about the gender gap? Try asking our bot below. Equal pay and the gender pay gap are two different things. Equal pay is awarding men and women the same amount to do identical or equivalent work. This is a legal requirement in the UK and has been for many years. The gender pay gap is the difference between average earnings for men and women. If women are being paid more, that's called a negative pay gap. Under new legislation, companies with 250 employees or more arelegally required to publish their gender pay gap,externalby 4 April, while the deadline for the public sector is 30 March. Having a gender pay gap isn't illegal, but failing to publicly disclose a figure by the deadline is. Companies are also encouraged to publish an action plan if needs be, to show how they intend to address the gap. The UK has a national median pay gap of 18.4%, as of April last year,according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).,external This is calculated by using the median average for men and women, which is the level of pay that half of people earn more than, and half earn less than. It's calculated on an hourly basis and includes full time and part-time workers. It's the key measurement used by the ONS. Companies have to publish both the median pay gap for their employees and the mean average gap, which is all salaries added together and divided by the number of people on the payroll. Data as of 8am on 20 March. Individual company data has been reported by companies to the Government Equalities Office. All gender pay gap figures in this article reflect the hourly median pay gap for all employees. The national and sector gender pay gap figures come from the 2017 ONS ASHE survey.

"'Dad got mum pregnant at 14, then killed her'","This video can not be played Tasnim Lowe, who visited her father in prison, said he showed no remorse for what he had done A woman whose mother gave birth to her at 14 says she wants an inquiry into why police did not charge her killer father with child sex crimes. Tasnim Lowe says her father has shown no remorse for murdering Lucy Lowe in a house fire in Telford -the town mired in fresh child sex abuse claims. Lucy was 16 and pregnant a second time by Azhar Ali Mehmood, 26, when she died in the blaze in 2000. West Mercia Police said it could not comment on specific cases. Lucy was legally incapable of consent when she was targeted and groomed by Mehmood at 12 years old. The taxi driver was jailed for life in 2001,externalfor murdering Lucy, and her sister and mother, by pouring petrol inside the house and setting it alight. He was not prosecuted for sex crimes. Lucy Lowe was 14 when she became pregnant by taxi driver Azhar Ali Mehmood Ms Lowe, 18, told the BBC: ""I would like to see that my dad shows remorse and that we can set up an investigation into why he was never charged with sex crimes."" She continued: ""He's my dad and it doesn't excuse what he did. He doesn't show any understanding but it's not something that I can say I really like him or really hate him. It's hard to explain."" Ms Lowe said the authorities and her mother's school should have ""taken charge"" to stop the teenager being groomed by Mehmood. ""They should have been like, 'This is wrong. This is illegal, we are going to do something about it',"" she added. 'Nobody asked me any questions' Telford abuse team cases 'near doubled' White working class girls 'traded for sex' Lucy was legally incapable of consent when she was targeted by Mehmood aged 12 Telford has been in the spotlight since the Sunday Mirror published a report about ""groups of mainly Asian men"" targeting vulnerable white teenagers in the town since the 1980s,external. Operation Chalice, launched by West Mercia Police,led to the jailing in 2012 of a group of menofficers believe may have targeted more than 100 girls. Lucy's father George Lowe, 73, said he believes the authorities did ""nothing"" to protect his daughter, who was described at Mehmood's trial as being in a ""relationship"" with her killer, despite her being underage. He said: ""The social services did nothing, schools did nothing and police did nothing, in a way. ""I had a word with her, but you know, you couldn't talk to her. ""She wasn't going to school for a start. They should have done something then. I can't understand it."" Azhar Ali Mehmood was ten years older than Lucy Telford and Wrekin Council said it could not discuss individual cases but added in a statement: ""We accept and regret that some historic practices were not effective 10 - 20 years ago. ""But so were services right across the country because awareness of child sexual exploitation (CSE) was then very different from now."" West Mercia Police previously said it is currently working with approximately 46 young people who were CSE victims or considered ""at risk"". This video can not be played Father of Telford abuse victim wishes daughter had told him Assistant Chief Constable Martin Evans said: ""We cannot provide any details which relate to specific individuals or investigations which may or may not be ongoing.

Tens of thousands missing pension perksA report suggests that 90% of people eligible are failing to claim National Insurance Credits.2m3 minutes agoBusiness,"As many as 90,000 grandparents and family members are missing out on a little-known perk that can increase their State Pension. National Insurance Credits for those who look after young children can be worth up to Â£230 a year in retirement. Insurance firm Royal London said 90% of those eligible were failing to claim the perk, known asAdult Specified Childcare Credit,external. It is for family members who look after their relatives' children. Parents or main carers can claim National Insurance Credits under a separate scheme. In the year to September 2017 there were 9,486 applications for the credit. However, that was a significant increase on the previous year, following an awareness campaign. Royal London obtained the figures under the Freedom of Information Act from HM Customs and Revenue (HMRC). Under the rules, any family member who looks after a child under 12 can make a claim, if the child's main carer or parent is working. They also have to be of working age. Many claimants are grandparents. Anyone wanting to make a claim can applyhere,external. Grandparents missing out on pension perks As with parents who stop work to care for children, National Insurance (NI) credits make up for gaps in contributions. Workers now need to have 35 years of NI contributions to claim the full State Pension. Some carers, and those out of work, can also claim NI credits. ""This National Insurance credit is a valuable right, and it is good news that the numbers claiming have risen so dramatically in such a short space of time,"" said Steve Webb, Royal London's policy director. ""But we believe that there are tens of thousands more grandparents who could be entitled to benefit, and we would encourage more of them to find out about the scheme and to make a claim."" The Department for Works and Pensions (DWP) advised people to get to know their pension, and find out what they may be entitled to. Parents who claim Child Benefit automatically receive NI credits while they have a child under 12.

"Russian diplomats leave amid spy rowAround 80 people, including 23 diplomats and their families, flew out of the UK on Tuesday.8h8 hours agoUK","The former diplomatic staff and their families flew out from Stansted Airport Russian diplomats and their families have left the UK in an expulsion following the Salisbury spy attack. Diplomatic vehicles drove them from the embassy in London to Stansted Airport, where they boarded a plane to Moscow. The UK expelled 23 diplomats after Prime Minister Theresa May said Russia was ""culpable"" for the poisoning of Sergei Skripal and his daughter. The government decided on Tuesday not to impose further sanctions on Russia for now. However, at a meeting of the National Security Council, Mrs May said: ""There are other measures that government and security officials are actively considering and stand ready to deploy at any time."" Strict checks by border officials on private flights have been introduced as the UK increases efforts to monitor and track those entering the country, Mrs May's spokesman added. What happens when you expel a diplomat? Russia stockpiling nerve agent - Johnson Who controls the world's most toxic chemicals? Spy poisoning: What we know so far Moscow has denied all involvement, and is expelling 23 British diplomats in response. The UK diplomats have until Saturday to leave Russia. The Kremlin is also closing down both the British Council in Russia, which promotes cultural ties between the nations, and the consulate in St Petersburg. The Russian foreign ministry, meanwhile, has invited all foreign ambassadors in Moscow to a meeting on Wednesday to clarify the Russian position on the Skripal affair, the Russian news agency Interfax has reported. The Russian Embassy in London said around 80 people - including the Russian intelligence officers and their families - were due to leave the UK on Tuesday, the deadline given by Mrs May. A small crowd gathered outside the embassy and waved goodbye to people carrying suitcases, children and pets as they boarded vehicles. Russian ambassador to the UK Alexander Yakovenkotweeted:,external""Today we bid farewell to our colleagues heading home after the hostile move of the UK Government, and wish them all the best in their careers."" Around Russian 80 nationals were aboard the plane heading for Moscow The BBC's diplomatic correspondent James Robbins said launching further measures ""risks an endless tit for tat with the Kremlin"". But ""not to do so risks accusations of weakness from some quarters,"" he added. Meanwhile, drivers or cyclists who captured video footage near the home of a murdered Russian businessman Nikolai Glushkov on 11 March or 12 March arebeing asked to contact police.,external Mr Glushkov wasfound dead from apparent ""compression to his neck""at his home in New Malden, south-west London last week. Russianformer military intelligence officer Sergei Skripal,66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, remain critically ill in hospital after being found slumped on a bench and unconscious on 4 March. They had been exposed to a nerve agent of a type developed by Russia called Novichok, the UK government claims. More than two weeks on from the attack, the head of counter-terrorism policing in the UK, Met Police Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu, said the focus of the Salisbury investigation is ""on the movements of the Skripals"". Sergei Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, are in a critical condition in hospital Officers are trawling through 4,000 hours of CCTV footage and have already taken 400 statements with more to come. ""It is going to take weeks, possibly months,"" Mr Basu told BBC Radio 4's Today programme, adding: ""This is going to be frustrating for people."" Meanwhile, following a phone call between Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Mrs May, Downing Street said Japan condemned the Salisbury attack and ""shared our outrage"". The leaders of France, Germany and the US have already pledged support for the UK in a joint statement and the EU offered its ""unqualified solidarity"". EU leaders will meet at a summit in Brussels on Thursday to discuss any potential response to Russia. Labour leader Jeremy Corbynsaid the UK must still deal with Russia despite ""all fingers"" pointing to itover the Salisbury spy attack. He said he would ""do business"" with Russian President Vladimir Putin but assertively and on the basis of the UK's values.

Mr Skripal, a retired military intelligence colonel, came to the UK in 2010 after being released from prison in Russia. He had been jailed in Moscow in 2006 for spying for Britain and passing the identities of Russian secret agents in Europe to MI6, the UK's Secret Intelligence Service.

"Man guilty of hate crime over 'Nazi pug'Mark Meechan recorded the dog reacting to statements such as ""Sieg Heil"" by raising its paw.7h7 hours agoGlasgow & West Scotland","Mark Meechan's clip was viewed more than three million times on YouTube A man who filmed a pet dog giving Nazi salutes before putting the footage on YouTube has been convicted of committing a hate crime. Mark Meechan, 30, recorded his girlfriend's pug, Buddha, responding to statements such as ""gas the Jews"" and ""Sieg Heil"" by raising its paw. But police were alerted and he was arrested for allegedly committing a hate crime. The original clip had been viewed more than three million times on YouTube. Meechan, of Coatbridge, Lanarkshire, went on trial at Airdrie Sheriff Court where he denied any wrong doing. He insisted he made the video, which was posted in April 2016, to annoy his girlfriend Suzanne Kelly, 29. But Sheriff Derek O'Carroll found him guilty of a charge under the Communications Act that he posted a video on social media and YouTube which was grossly offensive because it was ""anti-semitic and racist in nature"" and was aggravated by religious prejudice. Sheriff O'Carroll told the court he did not believe Meechan had made the video only to annoy his girlfriend and ruled it was anti-Semitic. He also said he believed Meechan - who was supported at court by Tommy Robinson, former leader of far-right group the English Defence League (EDL) - left the video on YouTube to drive traffic to other material he had on there. He added: ""In my view it is a reasonable conclusion that the video is grossly offensive ""The description of the video as humorous is no magic wand. ""This court has taken the freedom of expression into consideration. ""But the right to freedom of expression also comes with responsibility."" Sheriff O'Carroll said Meehan was ""quite obviously an intelligent and articulate man"". But he added: ""The accused knew that the material was offensive and knew why it was offensive. ""Despite that the accused made a video containing anti-Semitic content and he would have known it was grossly offensive to many Jewish people."" Ross Brown, defending, said Meechan had only intended the video to be seen by a small group of friends and to annoy his girlfriend. He said the material had been leaked and gone viral but Police Scotland then wrongly pursued Meechan despite his later videos attempting to ""set the record straight"". Mr Brown said: ""His girlfriend testified that Mr Meechan had never made known to her any anti-Semitic views whatsoever. ""The accused possesses both tolerant and liberal views. ""His girlfriend is in no doubt it was an example of his sense of humour."" Mr Brown told the court it was wrong to focus on the phrase ""gas the Jews"" when it had been taken out of context of the whole video. He claimed Jewish comedian David Baddiel had voiced his support for Meechan and had asked for him to walk free. He added: ""I can see that the video may not be to everyone's taste. ""Others may be able to see the comedic or satirical element to it. ""The court should seek to acquit Mr Meechan for no other reason but to show it is 2018 and not 1984."" Prosecutors had earlier asked for Meechan to be convicted and branded the video ""an odious criminal act that was dressed up to look like a joke."" Comedian Ricky Gervais took to Twitter to comment on the case after the verdict. He tweeted: ""A man has been convicted in a UK court of making a joke that was deemed 'grossly offensive'. ""If you don't believe in a person's right to say things that you might find 'grossly offensive', then you don't believe in Freedom of Speech.""
