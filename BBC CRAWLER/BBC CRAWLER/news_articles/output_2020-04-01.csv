Trump: 'Next couple of weeks will be horrific',"President Trump says there are difficult days ahead for the nation His news conference is focused on fighting drug cartels, which officials say are exploiting the pandemic The number to have died in the UK rises, by 563 to 2,352 UK intends to raise testing to the hundreds of thousands ""within weeks"" Wimbledon cancelled for first time since World War Two Spanish death toll up by 864 as Europe passes another grim milestone in the pandemic The official death toll in Iran is now more than 3,000 There are now more than 800,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19 around the world Max Matza, Jessica Murphy, Robert Greenall, Tom Spender, Claudia Allen, Andreas Illmer, Frances Mao, Saira Asher, Tessa Wong, Owen Amos, Krutika Pathi, Henri Astier and David Walker We're pausing our live updates of the coronavirus pandemic for now but we'll continue to bring you the latest developments across the BBC News website until our colleagues in Asia pick things up. For now, here are Wednesday's headlines: Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter A day after the White House coronavirus task force presented a dire outlook for the coming weeks that included more than 100,000 projected US deaths, Donald Trump shifted focus. Instead of leading with the latest efforts to control the spread of the disease, the president had his military officials talk about drug interdiction in Latin America. Eventually the subject did turn to the virus, with Trump once again warning that the days ahead would be âhorrificâ. He said he would not issue a nationwide stay-at-home order, however, because âstates are differentâ. Nor would he restrict airline flights out of âhotspotâ cities like New York, Detroit and New Orleans at this time. He also once again declined a chance to criticise the Chinese government for the spread of the virus â a marked change from past weeks. Trump had previously made a point to call the coronavirus the âChinese virusâ at every opportunity â even writing it in by hand in his briefing notes. Now he downplayed Chinaâs role as the source of the disease and suggested he had no opinion on allegations that China was underreporting its coronavirus deaths. âIâm not an accountant from China,â he said. Instead, he emphasised the recent Chinese trade deal and described his relationship with Chinese President Xi Jinping as âvery goodâ. While many of the presidentâs conservative supporters hold China responsible for the global pandemic, assigning blame no longer seems to be part of the presidentâs strategy. US President Donald Trump is accompanied by members of his national security team ""He was a little on the short side for the NBA,"" says Mr Trump about his top immunologist Dr Anthony Fauci, after reporters ask if he's been given a security detail due to his time in the public spotlight. Dr Fauci refuses to respond, and Mr Trump jumps in to say that everybody loves him. Mr Trump then tells a story he says he once heard about Dr Fauci winning an ""unwinnable"" basketball game. Dr Fauci is now giving an update on efforts to identify a vaccine to the coronavirus. He says US researchers are ""right on target"" to have a vaccine in the next year and a half. Mr Trump suggests that he may seek to curtail domestic flights, which in some cases, he says, are flying from ""hot spot to hot spot"". But, he says, if you do that ""youâre really clamping down on an industry"" that is desperate, as fewer and fewer people are travelling. ""Thatâs a calculation weâre looking at right now,"" he says. Mr Trump said that his ""older"" and ""heavier"" friend is not doing well after being infected with coronavirus. He says it was the ""severity"" of the virus and how infectious it was that led him to stop equating it to seasonal flu. ""It is so contagious. Nobody has seen anything like this,"" he says, adding: ""The flu is not anything like that."" ""Also the violence of it. if it hits the right person that person's in deep trouble,"" he says, adding that his own friend ""is in deep trouble"". Mr Trump continues, saying ""difficult days are ahead for our nation"". ""Weâre going to have a couple of weeks starting pretty much now that are going to be horrific. ""But even in the most challenging of times Americans do not despair, we do not give into fear. ""We persevere, we overcome and we win."" If you share one bit of advice with 20 of your friends and they then do the same, it only takes five times for that to happen for more than 3m people to see the message. That is how quickly information - and therefore misinformation - can spread. We all want to help our friends and families by passing on advice that can support them at this time - but if it turns out to be false it could end up doing more harm than good. In this video the BBC's Zeinab Badawi explains how we can all slow the spread of falsehoods online.  This video can not be played Coronavirus: How can you stop the spread of misinformation? The USS Theodore Roosevelt pictured in 2018 Reporters are now asking military officials about the 4,000 US Navy sailors whose ship, the USS Theodore Roosevelt, is facing a coronavirus outbreak that has already sickened scores of US sailors. Defense Secretary Mark Esper says he rejects the ""narrative out there that we should shut down entire US military"" to contain the spread. ""Thatâs not feasible. We have a mission, to protect United States and our people. So we live and work in cramped quarters,"" such as tanks, submarines and aircraft carriers. It's the ""nature of our business"", he adds. Guam has agreed to quarantine the sailors in hotels around the Pacific island US territory after the captain issued an urgent appeal for help. Read more here: Crew of US aircraft carrier to be quarantined in Guam President Donald Trump says that soon the US will have more ventilators than it needs, despite the claims by healthcare workers across the country that they are desperately lacking ventilators and other medical equipment. ""We're going to be distributing the extras around the world,"" Mr Trump says, specifically mentioning Italy, China and Spain. Earlier today, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo warned that only about 20% of people who are put on ventilators there are surviving Covid-19. Today's White House briefing has not featured updates from Drs Fauci or Birx, who have become the public faces of the administration's efforts to contain the virus. Instead the illegal narcotics trade has been the focus. ""For a long time we've had lots of drugs coming into our country,"" says Mr Trump. ""We want to see if we can stop a good percentage of the drugs coming into our country,"" Mr Trump says, arguing that the people who smuggle the drugs - who could be infected with Covid-19 - will also be kept from entering.

Nurse in Washington state While the White House daily briefing continues, here's a look at the policy decisions taken by President Trump's administration so far. Medical supply shortages, slow to test and mixed messaging are among the shortcomings in the US response,writes the BBC's Anthony Zurcher. The focus of the White House briefing on Covid-19 continues to be the illegal drugs trade. US Defense Secretary Mark Esper tells reporters that ""many criminal organisations are attempting to capitalise on this crisis"". The US military, he says, will ""keep the pressure on these criminal groups and protect Americans from the devastation caused"" by the illegal drug trade. ""You're not going to kill additional Americans,"" warns General Mark Milley. ""In this difficult time, I know that every American will do their patriotic duty and help us achieve this total victory,"" begins Mr Trump. He is joined at the podium by Attorney General Bill Barr, and members of the military. Mr Trump says that drug cartels are taking advantage of the pandemic to expand their network into the United States. He adds that the US Southern Command will double anti-drug efforts, in an effort to protect the health of all Americans. Cleaners wipe down the White House podium before the briefing The daily White House coronavirus briefing is due to begin very shortly. Yesterday Donald Trump said the next two weeks were going to be ""very, very painful"". In the past few hours, Mississippi and Georgia have issued stay-at-home orders, after the nearby state of Florida took the same action earlier today. The Republican governors of both states had been reluctant to issue mandatory orders, as had the Florida governor, who was facing massive pressure to shut down the state amid a growing death toll. On Wednesday, Florida's Ron DeSantis spoke directly to President Trump before issuing his decision. A majority of US states are now on lockdown, with over 75% of the US population told to stay at home. Meanwhile US country music superstar Dolly Parton has pledged $1m to Vanderbilt University, in her home state of Tennessee, to support research into a cure for Covid-19. On Twitter, Parton said she hoped to inspire ""people that can afford it to make donations"" as well. Starting on Thursday, the nine-time Grammy award winner will also begin reading children's stories in a new Facebook video series calledGoodnight with Dolly,external. The daily news briefing from the White House is due to get under way shortly. We'll let you know as soon as it begins. President Donald Trump and his Covid-19 task force will discuss the latest efforts to contain the outbreak - and the latest predictions. The US death toll has surpassed 4,000 and fears grow that as many as 240,000 people could die from the disease, even with the mitigation measures in place. New York is the hardest hit state in the nation. The UK will call up 3,000 military reservists as part of its response to the coronavirus outbreak. Their duties will include ""providing additional medical and logistical support for the NHS, acting as liaison officers and deploying specialist skills such as engineering and accounting"", the Ministry of Defencesaid on its website.,external They will be deployed for six months initially, and no-one already working for the NHS or delivering essential services will be mobilised to ensure they can continue in their roles, the ministry added. Armed Forces Minister James Heappey said: ""I know our reservists will answer the nation's call with real enthusiasm and will play a key part in our response to Covid-19."" Drive-through testing takes place at the former site of the Michigan state fairgrounds in Detroit Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan has said the city will be the first to use the new 15-minute coronavirus test kits recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The tests were sent on Wednesday by Abbott Laboratories, a Chicago-based company, and are being deployed immediately. Mr Duggan also said there were now 2,483 cases in Detroit and the death toll stood at 82. The city is also moving to test all emergency responders after 91 Detroit Police Department employees and 17 firefighters tested positive. Sales of alcohol have reportedly spiked in the US, where almost three out of four people are now under some form of lockdown. Online sales of alcoholic drinks more than tripled last week (up 243% compared to the same time period the year before), according to market research firm Nielsen. Shops sales also rose by 55% the research suggested - with tequila and gin named as the most popular tipples. In the UK, some online wine merchants had been forced to suspend orders ""due to unprecedented demand"" after pubs and clubs were told to close. But British off-licences have been told they can stay open - after being added to the list of essential businesses. It came as some British supermarketsplaced a limit on the amount of alcohol productsshoppers can buy at one time after their supplies kept running dry. Meanwhile, in South Africa, thesale of alcohol has been banned. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
"BA expected to suspend 36,000 staff","British Airways has reached a deal to temporarily suspend more than 30,000 of its cabin crew and ground staff. The airline, which has grounded most of its fleet due to the coronavirus, has been locked in talks with unions for more than a week. But on Thursday, BA boss Alex Cruz told staff that a large majority of employees would be suspended for the next two months. He said the government's job retention scheme would fund 80% of their wages. Explaining the decision, Mr Cruz said: ""We need to act now to protect jobs and ensure that BA comes out the other side of this crisis in the best possible shape."" The decision will affect all staff at Gatwick and London City Airport after the airline suspended its operations at both locations until the crisis is over. ""The number of colleagues who will be furloughed reflects the significant drop in flying,"" Mr Cruz said. Under the jobs retention scheme, the government funds 80% of someone's salary capped at a maximum of Â£2,500 a month. But union Unite said there would be no cap on earnings under its agreement with BA. The union also said no BA staff would be made redundant during the coronavirus crisis. ""Given the incredibly difficult circumstances that the entire aviation sector is facing this is as good a deal as possible for our members,"" the union's national officer for aviation, Oliver Richardson, said in a statement. No one who works at British Airways will be surprised at today's announcement. When the planes are sitting on the ground - and nearly all of BA's fleet is doing just that, dispersed to regional airports around the country - there is no need for the army of workers who fly the aircraft, maintain them, load and unload the bags, and serve the passengers. Staff typically make up about 40% of an airline's costs, and BA should be able to reclaim 80% of wages from the government employment support scheme set up to help companies affected by the virus. BA has not, so far, asked the government for any other specific financial assistance. Nor has EasyJet, where senior sources say the general assistance programmes - wage assistance and loan guarantees - should be sufficient. Virgin Atlantic, however, continues to press, and has written to MPs pointing out that it provides the only British-flagged competition to British Airways on many key routes from Heathrow. So far the Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has taken a hard line, saying airlines should exhaust all financial revenues before turning to the taxpayer. If Virgin does make a formal application for more aid, it will have to be able to show it has met the chancellor's test. BA had already reached a separate deal with its 4,000 pilots who will take a 50% pay cut over two months. John Strickland, independent aviation analyst, said ""tough negotiations"" between BA and the Unite union meant it had taken a while to reach an agreement. ""The pilots' deal for half pay was concluded rather earlier - I guess there was a recognition as to just how serious that issue was,"" he said. BA's parent company, International Airlines Group (IAG), is in a better financial position than some of its competitors. The group has made healthy profits in recent years. But the airline's expected decision to suspend such a large number of workers gives a sense of how hard UK aviation has been hit by travel restrictions designed to stem the spread of the pandemic.

Over the next three months, the International Air Transport Association expects airlines to rack up losses of almost $40bn (Â£32.3bn). It said carriers were burning through their cash reserves fast, mainly because of the multi-billion-pound cost of refunding tickets for cancelled flights. Many staff at Virgin Atlantic have had their jobs suspended for two months and crews at Easyjet are out of work for three months. This week, British Airways has run government repatriation flights to get hundreds of British nationals home from Peru, after the country went into lockdown. It is one of several UK-based airlines that has agreed to run further repatriation flights in the coming weeks as hundreds of thousands of people are still stuck in other parts of the world.

Why are planes still flying?,"You've only got to look up to see there's still a fair amount of activity in the air, despite all the airline cutbacks. Why is that? Surprisingly, a number of global airlines are still running passenger flights, including British Airways (BA). That's despite aviation largely grinding to a halt as the coronavirus crisis hit passenger traffic numbers and governments banned flights. But tens of thousands of Britons stranded abroad will be flown homeunder a new government agreement, while many planes carry essential cargo. Passenger flights are believed to have been cut by up to 95%, but that still means one in 20 are taking off. Airlines say they are keeping vital links open. ""We are working with European Union (EU) governments to try to keep some minimum flight links open for emergency reasons, even though the passenger loads on these flights will be very low,"" said Ryanair. The coronavirus outbreak has had a severe impact on demand for air travel But other flights are to bring stranded people home. BA, Virgin Atlantic, EasyJet, Jet2 and Titan are among airlines that have agreed to fly Britons back to the UK. ""We are doing everything we can to bring customers home, including critical workers,"" BA told the BBC. ""Not all governments are allowing flights. We are working with the Foreign Office to open routes where we can."" The UK government has also pledged Â£75m to help provide charter flights to bring UK nationals back from countries where commercial flights aren't available. The UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab announced a deal between government and airlines to return Britons stranded by coronavirus on Monday BA is already operating a number of repatriation flights chartered by the Foreign Office from Lima, Peru. Heathrow Airport said it is working closely with Public Health England officials ""to facilitate their access to the airport so that they can implement their enhanced monitoring measures as a precaution. ""In line with the latest Public Health England advice, we are encouraging passengers and colleagues to maintain good hand hygiene."" Meanwhile, Ryanair said all its aircraft ""are disinfected daily"". ""With low loads, social distancing will be optimised on-board,"" the airline said. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash That's difficult to find out, but you can check at any airport's website to see how many planes are flying in and out at any given time. When the BBC checked Heathrow Airport - heathrow.com/departures - on Monday morning, for instance, there were flights scheduled in the following hour or so to Dublin, Copenhagen, Bahrain, Manchester, Helsinki, Amsterdam, Warsaw, Madrid, Hamburg, Moscow, Barcelona, Doha, Berlin, Paris, Kuala Lumpur, Valencia, Boston and Stockholm. You can also see at-a-glance live data of how many flights are in the air at any one time through flight tracker website flightradar24.com. But many flights you see in the sky will be cargo planes. The amount of cargo handling via Heathrow Airport has doubled in recent days, it told the BBC. They often carry vital supplies, including food and medical equipment. For example, two-fifths of the UK's pharmaceutical products such as medicines, vaccines and respirators are imported via Heathrow Airport. The airport is the UK's largest port by value, with 34% of the country's cargo passing through. Normally 95% of the cargo that comes into Heathrow Airport is carried in the belly-hold of passenger planes, but the airport is currently ""repurposing its operation and scaling up its cargo offering"". It has temporarily increased the number of dedicated cargo flights. ""These will bring in vital supplies of food and medical equipment to help Britain weather this storm,"" said Heathrow boss John Holland-Kaye. Last week it reported a 243% increase in the number air traffic movements carrying only cargo. During normal operations, the airport usually handles 47 cargo-only planes a week, on average. On Tuesday 31 March, it is forecast to have 48 cargo-only planes in just one day.

Trump changes tack,"Both President Trump (left) and Dr Fauci acknowledged the seriousness of the situation There was no sugar-coating it this time. No optimistic talk of miracle cures or Easter-time business re-openings. There was just the cold, hard reality of the facts on the ground. ""I want every American to be prepared for the hard days that lie ahead,"" a grave-faced Donald Trump said in his Tuesday afternoon press conference. ""This is going to be a very, very painful two weeks."" Trump extends US virus guidelines to end of April Trump backs away from New York 'quarantine' How painful? When the president was asked how many Americans are currently projected to die from the virus given even the current mitigation efforts, he said it was better if his medical experts responded. The number of deaths, based on current projections, is between 100,000 and 200,000. On 15 April, for instance, 2,214 Americans are expected to die. This video can not be played When asked about the scarcity of masks, Donald Trump suggests scarves as protection against Covid-19 ""No-one is denying that we're going through a very, very difficult time,"" said Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. ""That's what it is."" The president tried to frame this news as best he could, noting that the projections for US casualties if the government had done nothing were in the millions. ""A lot of people were saying think of it as the flu, but it's not the flu,"" he said. ""It's vicious."" Refrigeration units are being used as makeshift morgues in New York City - the worst hit place in the US Of course, it was just a week ago the president himself was making exactly such comparisons, noting that the early fatality numbers were much less than those from the flu or even automobile accidents. ""We lose thousands of people a year to the flu,"" he said then. ""We never turn the country off."" Three out of four Americans under some form of lockdown What this crisis reveals about US and Trump Now, however, the seriousness of the situation has hit home. He spoke of checking in on a friend who was in the hospital with the virus -  ""a little older, and he's heavy, but he's tough person"" - only to find out he was now in a coma. ""I spoke to some of my friends, and they can't believe what they're seeing,"" he said. This video can not be played US death rates v UK, Italy and South Korea Mr Trump's change of attitude also extended to some of his recent political feuds. Just days after attacking Democratic Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, mocking her name and calling her incompetent on Twitter, the president said he had a ""really great conversation"" with her and detailed the support the federal government was providing her state. Last Friday, he had suggested that if state leaders were not ""appreciative"" of him, he wouldn't talk to them. On Tuesday, he recounted conversations with Democratic governors in California and Louisiana. There was still a veiled shot at New York and its Democratic governor Andrew Cuomo, however, as the president suggested that both his state and New Jersey - the two hardest hit in the US - ""got off to a very late start"" with their pandemic response. Trump also pushed back against Cuomo's complaint earlier on Tuesday that states were being forced to bid against each other, and the federal government, on the ventilator market. ""They shouldn't be doing that,"" the president said. ""If that happens, they should be calling us. If they need them that badly, we know."" ""Some people frankly think they need them but they don't need them,"" he added. The new call from the White House was to continue the current mitigation efforts for an additional 30 days; that even if things go from bad to worse in the weeks to come, the efforts will pay off. It will, however, be a long, slow grind. ""There's no magic bullet,"" said Dr Deborah Birx, one of the experts on the US taskforce. ""There's no magic vaccine or therapy. Just behaviours,"" she said.

Virus forces postponement of key climate talks,"The Scottish Events Campus in Glasgow, which is due to host COP26, includes the Armadillo and the SSE Hydro buildings A key climate summit in Glasgow will be delayed until next year due to disruption caused by the coronavirus. The announcement was made in a joint statement from the UK and UN after a ""virtual"" meeting of officials. Dozens of world leaders were due to attend the COP26 gathering that was set to run in Glasgow from November 9 this year. It is expected that the conference will now take place by the middle of next year. 'Another year of failureâ Government insists COP26 summit will be in Glasgow Sturgeon and Gove make climate summit pledge As the virus has spread around the world, there has been a growing expectation in recent weeks that the COP26 talks would be delayed. Around 30,000 delegates, journalists and environmental campaigners were due in Scotland for the meeting. However the changing priorities that coronavirus has forced on governments can be clearly seen in Glasgow's Scottish Events Campus (SEC) which was due to host the talks. It is now set to become a temporary hospital to house patients affected by Covid-19. The decision to move COP26 was taken by UN officials, including UN climate chief Patricia Espinosa and UK Business Secretary Alok Sharma, who is president-designate of the meeting. ""The world is currently facing an unprecedented global challenge and countries are rightly focusing their efforts on saving lives and fighting Covid-19,"" Mr Sharma said in a statement. ""That is why we have decided to reschedule COP26."" ""We will continue working tirelessly with our partners to deliver the ambition needed to tackle the climate crisis and I look forward to agreeing a new date for the conference."" Alok Sharma is president-designate of the meeting Five years on from the landmark Paris agreement, all nations were due to put new improved climate action plans on the table at the Glasgow meeting. Environmental groups said the decision was understandable. ""Postponing COP26 is the right thing to do - public health and safety must come first now,"" said Laurence Tubiana, one of the architects of the Paris agreement and CEO of European Climate Foundation. ""This crisis has shown that international cooperation and solidarity are essential to protect global well-being and peace. COP26 next year should become a centre piece of revitalized global cooperation."" The summit has had its fair share of controversy withrows between the UK and Scottish governments, and with Claire O'Neill, the minister originally appointed to run the talks,sacked by Prime Minister Boris Johnson. While the delay was almost inevitable in the light of coronavirus, some officials believe there may be a silver lining. Governments are set to spend huge amounts to boost their economies once the pandemic is over. There's a view that when the summit is eventually held, it could be an important forum for ensuring that money is spent on sustainable and renewable projects. ""The pandemic will also reorder to an extent the priorities for COP26, as alongside the UN climate process countries will be devising stimulus packages for economies hard-hit by the crisis,"" said Adair Turner, Senior Fellow at the Institute for New Economic Thinking. ""With low-carbon stimulus as a new priority for COP26, it should be seen as an opportunity to rebuild economies hit by coronavirus in ways that are healthier, more resilient to future shocks and fairer to a wider range of people.""

"PM vows more virus tests as UK deaths exceed 2,000","NHS workers have been tested at a drive-through site at an Ikea store in Wembley, north London The government is facing growing pressure to ramp up coronavirus testing, as the UK saw its biggest daily increase in deaths. Some 2,352 virus patients had died in hospital as of 17:00 on Tuesday - up 563 in a day,the latest figures show,external. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said testing was ""massively increasing"" and it was ""the way through"" the pandemic. Meanwhile a major international climate meeting,COP26, is the latest event to be postponed as a result of the virus. The climate talks were due to take place at Glasgow's Scottish Events Campus in November - which is being turned into a temporary field hospital to treat coronavirus patients. The UN's climate body, the UNFCCC, and the UK government said the summit would be pushed back to 2021. Ina video message posted on Twitter,external, the prime minister said Wednesday had been a ""sad, sad day"" due to the high number of deaths in the UK. Mr Johnson, who is self-isolating in Downing Street after contracting the virus, also reiterated the government's commitment to ""ramp up"" testing. He said: ""This is how we will unlock the coronavirus puzzle. This is how we will defeat it in the end."" The government has been under pressure to increase the screening of medics, so that those who are self-isolating unnecessarily can return to work. More than 3,500 NHS frontline staff in England and Wales have been tested for the virus since the outbreak began. But cabinet minister Michael Gove said a shortage of chemicals needed for the tests meant the NHS - which employs 1.2m in England - could not screen all workers. The prime minister's official spokesman said the government was working with NHS England, Public Health England and other organisations to boost test capacity with an additional network of labs and testing sites. Dr Yvonne Doyle, Public Health England medical director, told a daily coronavirus briefing in Downing Street that there was currently capacity for about 3,000 tests a day for frontline NHS staff. She said the ""intention"" was for testing for frontline staff to increase from ""thousands to hundreds of thousands within the coming weeks"". The World Health Organization has said the world is set to reach one million confirmed cases and 50,000 deaths worldwide in the next few days. Dr Doyle said the UK was not in ""as severe"" a position as Spain, the US or Italy, but added there was ""no reason to be complacent"". She said while the spread of the virus was most advanced in London, the Midlands was ""obviously a concern"" too. As of 9:00 on Wednesday, 152,979 people in the UK had been tested for the virus with 29,474 confirmed positive. This includes 4,139 cases in the Midlands and 8,341 in London. Dr Doyle added while use of public transport had gone down since the government enforced social distancing measures, an ""up-tick"" in motor vehicle use in the last 24 hours was ""slightly concerning"". She urged members of the public to stay home to ""protect the NHS"". The number of questions about the lack of testing at the daily press conference came as no surprise. The government has been heavily criticised for not increasing testing capacity more quickly. Dr Doyle said she was confident the UK would achieve the target of 25,000 tests a day by the end of the month. There is some way to go - over the past 24 hours just shy of 10,000 tests have been done. The lack of tests means NHS staff have had to self-isolate at home when members of their household show symptoms. News that there are going to be five drive-through centres for staff will also help. But it was interesting Dr Doyle was also asked by how much more testing can be increased by in the long-term. If the number of cases does come down, testing will play a crucial role in allowing the lockdown to be eased. The plan would be to contain the virus by testing lots of people quickly. That will require the UK to be able to tests hundreds of thousands of people a day. A doctor who came out of retirement to volunteer for the NHS has become the fourth UK medic to die with the virus, which causes the disease Covid-19. Dr Alfa Sa'adu, 68, had been volunteeringat Queen Victoria Memorial Hospital in Welwyn when he contracted coronavirus. His son Dani Saadu posted online that his dad had died after ""fighting the virus for two weeks"". ""My dad was a living legend, worked for the NHS for nearly 40 years saving people's lives here and in Africa,"" he said. The BBC's head of statistics Robert Cuffe said the latest increases in the number of patients dying with coronavirus balance out with the below-average rises on Sunday and Monday. How to understand the coronavirus death toll He said the number of new deaths has been increasing at a slightly slower rate than earlier in the epidemic, ""but if that keeps up, we'd expect to see in the region of a thousand deaths a day by the weekend"".

The prime minister's official spokesperson said the government was working with a number of suppliers which had come forward with offers of PPE, or proposals to manufacture more. It follows criticism from some frontline workers over the lack of protective equipment, with staff at one hospital in Essexwarning they could ""limit services""to patients with coronavirus ""to a bare minimum"" over fears for their own safety.

Spain's deaths soar but infection rate slows,"Spain has the second-highest number of deaths related to coronavirus Spain has recorded another 864 deaths related to coronavirus, the highest in one day, as the total number of deaths across Europe has gone beyond 30,000. More than 9,000 people have died in Spain, which is second only to Italy in fatalities caused by the virus. Confirmed cases in the country have passed 100,000, but numbers show the infection rate continues to fall. UN Secretary General AntÃ³nio Guterres said the pandemic was the world's biggest challenge since World War Two. The warning comes amid dire predictions about the possible economic impact of measures imposed to fight the virus. A UN report estimates that up to 25 million jobs could be lost around the world as the result of the outbreak. The number of confirmed cases globally is now over 870,000, with more than 43,000 deaths, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University in the US. Follow our latest updates on the coronavirus crisis Wednesday's number of deaths in Spain was marginally higher than the 849 announced the day before, and the country has now seen more than 800 deaths for five days in a row. But health officials believe the latest 12% increase in daily infections is further evidence that the rate has stabilised. Spain has been in lockdown for over two weeks, with further restrictions on movement introduced two days ago. But health services in the hardest-hit areas, including Madrid and Catalonia, are still struggling, with shortages of medical equipment a particular problem. In France two high-speed trains have been equipped to move patients infected with Covid-19 out of the Paris region Italy remains the worst-affected country, with a total of 105,792 confirmed cases and 13,155 deaths. Spain has 102,136 cases and 9,053 deaths. However, Italy has seen the daily rise in infection rates fall to less than 3%, well down on a few days ago. The number of deaths in the US has now topped 4,000, and Iran says Covid-19 - the disease caused by coronavirus - has claimed 3,000 lives. Belgium said more than half its intensive care beds were occupied as it reported a rise of 123 deaths, bringing the country's death toll to 828. Meanwhile France reported 509 deaths from Coronavirus in the last 24 hours, bringing the total to 4,032. It is the fourth country to record more than 4,000 fatalities after Italy, Spain and the US. The total number of confirmed cases is now 56,989, up about 9% from Tuesday. The UK on Wednesday recorded 563 deaths in 24 hours - it is the first time its daily toll has been higher than France's. However Britain's overall death toll, 2,352, is still lower. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? AVOIDING CONTACT:Should I self-isolate? STRESS:How to protect your mental health MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak Speaking at the UN headquarters in New York Mr Guterres said: ""The new coronavirus disease is attacking societies at their core, claiming lives and people's livelihoods"". He said it could bring a recession ""that probably has no parallel in the recent past"". ""Covid-19 is the greatest test that we have faced together since the formation of the United Nations,"" he said, calling for ""an immediate co-ordinated health response to suppress transmission and end the pandemic"".

Manufacturing output in the UK in March hit its lowest point since 2012, and unemployment in Austria has soared 52.5% on March last year to its highest level since 1946.

There is an unseemly competition for scarce medical equipment. But experts at the Rusi think-tank in London are already looking to the future. They argue the world needs a whole new kind of institution to deal with so-called ""black sky hazards"" - natural or man-made disasters that are of such a scale that they disrupt the whole global system of interdependent supply chains on which human life depends. The authors, Karin von Hippel and Randolph Kent, say there is no current organisation to coordinate the sharing of information and policy options in the way that the World Health Organization covers public health. They suggest a new body established by the UN, but not part of it, to provide a forum for promoting discourse and solutions for ever more entangled problems of global consequence. The aim, clearly, is to be better prepared next time. How have you been affected by the issues relating to coronavirus? Share your experiences by emailinghaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external.

Universal credit claims soar to nearly a million,"The pandemic has led to the closure of Job Centres Nearly a million people have applied for universal credit benefits in the past fortnight as the coronavirus pandemic has worsened. The Department for Work and Pensions said 950,000 successful applications for the payment were made between 16 March, when people were advised to work from home, and the end of the month. The department would normally expect 100,000 claims in a two week period. Officials said they were working ""flat out"" to help people get support. But Labour said the figures were ""truly shocking"" and the government ""must wake up and take action"" to help the millions of those at risk of losing their jobs and the self-employed not covered by government hardship schemes. The figures show the massive increase in demand on the benefit system since the government urged people to avoid non-essential travel and contact with others to curb the spread of the virus. There was a warning on Wednesday that 20% of small businesses could fold in the next month due to the collapse in consumer demand, despite unprecedented government intervention to support jobs. Universal credit is a consolidated monthly payment for those of working-age, which replaced a host of previous benefits including income-based jobseeker's allowance, housing benefit, child tax credit and working tax credit. In October 2019, there were 2.6 million universal credit claimants - just over a third of whom were in work. What is universal credit? Kuenssberg: New universal credit claims signal economic need The government said the benefit system was still ""delivering"" despite the massive increase in demand. ""With such a huge increase in claims there are pressures on our services, but the system is standing up well to these and our dedicated staff are working flat out to get people the support they need,"" a spokesperson said. ""We're taking urgent action to boost capacity - we've moved 10,000 existing staff to the help on the front line and we're recruiting more."" The sudden and vast increase in those signing up is powerful evidence that the coronavirus crisis is an economic emergency for a very significant portion of the public, losing work and losing income in ways they could never have anticipated a few short weeks ago. The numbers of people losing out on work could therefore be higher even than this significant level. But given the numbers who have managed to register, there are obviously very significant efforts going on at the DWP to expand the service to try to meet the scale of the need. The government has already stepped in with support for the economy and for workers in ways that have no modern parallel. In time, there may be questions about whether the country can really afford to support new legions of workers through hard times for more than a short emergency period. But right now, these figures provide urgent evidence that only a fortnight after the country was told to shut up shop, there are many, many thousands, already in economic need. Since the virus struck, the government has made a series of changes designed to make it easier for the self-employed to claim the benefit and to ensure they will not lose out as their earnings dry up. Labour has urged ministers to go much further, saying the verification process for new claimants should be speeded up and upfront cash advances - available for those in urgent need - should not have to be repaid. ""People need help now,"" said shadow work and pensions secretary Margaret Greenwood. ""The government should turn advances into non-repayable grants to end the five week wait and make sure people get the support they need quickly at a level that genuinely protects them from poverty.""

M&S store staff get bonus for coming into work,"Morrisons is the latest supermarket to reward workers during the coronavirus crisis, with a threefold increase in bonus for the next 12 months. Marks & Spencer had already promised staff an extra 15% pay, while Aldi, Sainsbury's and Tesco have pledged 10%. Asda meanwhile has offered an extra week's pay in June, working out as a 25% bonus for the month. Bosses say they are rewarding ""dedication and commitment"" and ""outstanding work"". ""It's been an extraordinary couple of weeks and despite the enormous challenges, it's been incredible to see how colleagues have stepped up and responded, doing an outstanding job during this uncertain and difficult time,"" said Tesco UK boss Jason Tarry. Sainsbury's retail and operations director Simon Roberts said: ""Our store, depot and customer service colleagues are working around the clock at the moment. ""Their dedication and commitment has been extraordinary."" Easter egg crackdown over essential status 'wrong' Sainsburyâs uses âloopholeâ to keep Argos open Supermarkets scrap some product restrictions It varies depending on the supermarket chain, but all appear to be recognising the extra efforts that workers are being asked to make. Morrisons:The chain says all frontline staff will receive a 6% bonus on their earnings for the next 12 months, after staff complained they were initially offered just 0.75%. The changes represent a bonus of Â£1,050 for a full-time worker compared to the Â£351 that would have been paid last year. Aldi:""Aldi has announced enhanced pay for its amazing colleagues, who have been working tirelessly throughout this extremely busy time. Store and distribution colleagues will receive a 10% bonus on hours worked, effective from 9 March 2020."" Sainsbury's:""As a small thank you for all their efforts, we will be giving colleagues a payment of 10% of the hours they have worked since March 8. The 10% additional pay will be awarded in May to hourly paid colleagues in Sainsbury's and Argos retail, Sainsbury's transport and warehouse teams, Argos distribution and all Retail contact centres."" Tesco:""Tesco will be giving a 10% bonus on the hourly rate for hours worked to colleagues across its stores, distribution centres and customer engagement centres. all permanent colleagues who are currently in work will receive the increased hourly pay rate till Friday 1 May, when we will review the situation."" Asda:""There will be an extra week's pay in June to our colleagues in recognition of their extra efforts to protect the health of their colleagues who needed to step away during this time."" Lidl:""Our teams are playing a crucial role in serving communities across the country and their incredible commitment and hard work is hugely appreciated. As a token of our gratitude, Lidl colleagues across the business are being given a Â£150 voucher each."" Co-op:""It's important to reward our colleagues for working through these difficult times. That's why we've given them a bonus, money to spend and extra time off."" Waitrose:""We are looking at a number of options to ensure we find a suitable way to recognise our partners who have shown incredible professionalism and dedication."" M&S:""Our frontline colleagues across stores and supply chain who continue to work will receive an additional 15% pay reward in recognition of the work they are doing to support their teams and the national effort to help customers access the products they need during these unprecedented times."" Supermarkets have come under enormous pressure in recent weeks as shoppers have stocked up The supermarkets have mostly announced plans to support staff who contract the coronavirus. ""We've committed to supporting our colleagues that have been identified by the government as needing to self-isolate for 12 weeks, ensuring these colleagues receive full pay for their isolation period,"" said Asda boss Roger Burnley. The supermarket is also offering 12 weeks fully paid leave to those over the age of 70, or who are pregnant and classed as vulnerable, as well as the carers of extremely vulnerable people. M&S said: ""Any colleague who needs to self-isolate for seven to 14 days can do so on full pay"". On top of that it said: ""frontline colleagues who have caring commitments or who are feeling more vulnerable are able to step away at this time. Any colleague who is furloughed for the coming weeks will do so on full pay."" Some workers are in line for thank-you bonuses for their efforts in the current crisis. Compass Group, for instance, is awarding bonuses of between 8%-17% to its 7,800 employees supporting the NHS as ward hosts, hospital porters or cleaners. ""Compass employees are playing an invaluable role in the country's battle against coronavirus, ensuring NHS patients and staff are fed and their wards are kept clean, and supporting key workers in the education, defence and infrastructure sectors,"" said managing director Robin Mills.

A 21-year-old from Cardiff has shared ways of dealing with anxiety during the coronavirus outbreak. Naomi, a final-year psychology student from Cardiff, had her exams cancelled and her lectures moved online, and said she used to volunteer and have a strict routine to help cope with the condition. She spoke to BBC Stories after a survey found the pandemic washaving a huge impact on young people with existing mental health conditions. Naomi said keeping a journal of how she was feeling and what she was grateful for helped. ""Those questions point me to think about what I have done during the day and what's been positive, and also write about the things that I'm worrying about,"" she said. Naomi's self help journal Companies not observing correct social-distancing for employees will not be eligible for Welsh Government support, the economy minister has said. Ken Skates said withholding financial help was an âimportant tool to make sure businesses behave properly"". Plaid Cymru AM Helen Mary Jones said she had been contacted by people whoâd been âpressed to work when they should be self-isolatingâ and were working in circumstances where there was âno proper social-distancingâ. She said these âbad businessesâ were âa minorityâ, but called on the Welsh Government to âconsider enforcementâ of the coronavirus guidelines. Speaking at a Senedd plenary session, Mr Skates said he was still discussing enforcement with the UK government and Welsh councils. However he said âany business failing to adhere to social-distancing will be exempt from getting our support or that support would be clawed backâ. The minister also told AMs he had witnessed shop workers facing abuse from customers, which he described as âutterly, utterly reprehensible"". Cleaning staff and caretakers in Bridgend county borough have been praised for their early starts and extra hours to get emergency childcare hubs ready to open every day during the coronavirus crisis. Cleaning supervisor Michal Sobocinski said cleaning crews were starting work at 0400 and using 15 times as much bleach as usual to clean schools daily. ""It is a stressful time, weâre constantly aware of the threat of the virus and its implications,"" he said. Council leader Huw David said: âWe are so thankful for the hard work and commitment of our cleaners and caretakers, they are doing an absolutely incredible job in these uncertain times."" Mr Sobocinski's nine-year-old daughter has shown her support by drawing a picture of him fighting the virus.

That is ten times the number officials would normally expect in a two-week period. Officials said they were working ""flat out"" to help people get support. The latest figures suggest up to one in four prison staff in England and Wales are absent due to Covid-19 issues. That's according to BBC Home Affairs Correspondent Danny Shaw, who has tweeted this evening. He said there are also ""ominous"" warnings over âincreased tension... over suspension of visits"" and other restrictions.  Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Changes are expected to the way children entitled to free school meals are fed during the coronavirus crisis. The UK government has defended usingthe online conferencing software Zoomto hold cabinet video conferences. Questions had been raised about potential security risks after the prime minister tweeted a picture in which a meeting ID was visible. ""In the current unprecedented circumstances, the need for effective channels of communication is vital,"" a government spokeswoman told BBC News A source added the app was quick to set up between the varying systems used by different government departments. Over time, a more coherent system was expected to be introduced, the source said. Staff at Wales' largest hospital are getting ready fora potential ""huge wave""in new cases of coronavirus. Hundreds of doctors and nurses are being trained on dummy patients in a simulation ward at the University Hospital of Wales, in Cardiff. And it's not just the clinical staff who are getting ready for new cases - behind the scenes, cleaners and catering staff are working hard to keep the hospital going. People calling 999 for help are not saying they have coronavirus symptoms out of fear an ambulance won't be sent. The Welsh Ambulance Service said this meant paramedics were going into people's homes without protective equipment, putting them at risk of contracting the virus. In a video message on YouTube, director of operations Lee Brooks said they would always send an ambulance ""when warranted"" and pleaded with people to be ""honest"". Allow YouTube content?

Closing public toilets during the coronavirus pandemic is impacting the elderly and delivery drivers, a councillor has said. Public conveniences were closed in Gwynedd and Ceredigion to try to limit the spread of the virus. But Councillor Mike Stevens, who represents Tywyn, Meirionydd, said this had ""unintended consequences"". He said an elderly woman in his community was treated for dehydration after not drinking anything for hours before a hospital appointment in Aberystwyth, as she was worried she would not find any toilets open during the journey. A Welsh Conservative MP has demanded ""urgent answers"" from the Welsh Secretary over the situation surround Covid-19 testing. It emerged on Saturday that an agreement to provide 5,000 extra tests a day in Wales hadcollapsed. Stephen Crabb, who chairs the UK's Welsh Affairs Committee, has written to fellow Tory Simon Hart, seeking ""urgent clarification"" on what knowledge and involvement the UK Government had of the deal. The Preseli Pembrokeshire MP - himself a former Welsh Secretary - said:
âThe reported collapse of a deal for up to 5,000 additional daily tests in Wales comes at a moment of heightened public concern about the need for much greater Covid-19 testing. ""It raises important questions about the level of inter-governmental coordination and cooperation between Whitehall and Cardiff Bay in the procurement of tests and other essential equipment."" Earlier today, Wales' First Minister Mark Drakefordconfirmed the company involvedin the abandoned testing deal was Roche, but the Swiss firm said there had been no such deal. A nursing body has asked the Health and Safety Executive to intervene as front-line staff are still struggling to access protective gear. The Royal College of Nursing in Wales (RCN) said there ""continues to be an issue with the provision of Personal Protective Equipment"" (PPE) in Wales. Director Helen Whyley said: âI have already expressed my concerns to the First Minister and Health Minister for Wales and unfortunately, the problems continue."" The Welsh Government hasaccepted there have been ""localised challenges and problems""with ensuring PPE is available to all in the Welsh NHS. Responding to a question in the Senedd today, Health Minister Vaughan Gething said there had been widespread demand for PPE in âany and every settingâ, and a UK-wide ârapid reviewâ of the guidance was underway. Elizabeth John was one of the patients with a long-term illness shocked to receive a letter from her GP surgery asking her to a sign a ""do not resuscitate"" form. An extra Â£5.5m will be given to schemes to support farmers during the coronavirus outbreak, the Welsh Government has announced. The money will be allocated to the Basic Payment Scheme and the Glastir scheme, to alleviate potential cash-flow problems. Rural Affairs Minister Lesley Griffiths said this would help farmers to âkeep doing the great work they do and help the sector during this difficult time"". Conservative Welsh Assembly member Andrew RT Davies described the measures as âweakâ and said âmore can and should be done to support our rural communities"". Police could be called if too many mourners turn up to funerals, a funeral director has said. Current coronavirus restrictions have meant the number of mourners allowed to attend funerals and cremations is capped in certain areas. Dean Thomas, a funeral director in Caerphilly, said he is being asked to restrict numbers to five family members only. ""The biggest issue we face is families canât attend,"" he said. ""There are guidelines in place which state who can attend. This includes close family, carers, parents and children. ""If more people turn up, the funeral wonât be allowed to continue, and the police could be called. ""The local authority are citing safety.
Families are being asked to choose. Itâs not right."" Previously, Health Minister Vaughan Gething has said individual funerals may not be possible if the number of coronavirus deaths is at the ""top end of the reasonable worst case scenario"".  A
temporary hospital with about 250 beds for patients with Covid-19 symptoms is
being set up at Bangor University. Sports
and leisure facilities are being used in a partnership between the university
and Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board. Health
board chairman Mark Polin said: âThe development of temporary hospitals like
this are central to our plans to achieve the additional capacity we need,
alongside developing additional space within our hospitals. âI
would like to assure the public that the preparatory work on identifying
suitable sites has been underway for some time and is now moving at
considerable pace. âWe
are assessing sites in Flintshire and Wrexham where a third temporary hospital
will be developed.â Venue
Cymru in Llandudno will also be converted to hold an additional 350 temporary
beds, and construction work on a further 80 beds is currently taking place at

"Spain's deaths soar but infection rate slowsWith more than 9,000 deaths, Spain has the second-highest number of fatalities caused by coronavirus.Europe'Passionate' doctor dies after contracting virusDr Alfa Saadu worked as a medical director and across many hospitals in London, his family said.England","Spain has the second-highest number of deaths related to coronavirus Spain has recorded another 864 deaths related to coronavirus, the highest in one day, as the total number of deaths across Europe has gone beyond 30,000. More than 9,000 people have died in Spain, which is second only to Italy in fatalities caused by the virus. Confirmed cases in the country have passed 100,000, but numbers show the infection rate continues to fall. UN Secretary General AntÃ³nio Guterres said the pandemic was the world's biggest challenge since World War Two. The warning comes amid dire predictions about the possible economic impact of measures imposed to fight the virus. A UN report estimates that up to 25 million jobs could be lost around the world as the result of the outbreak. The number of confirmed cases globally is now over 870,000, with more than 43,000 deaths, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University in the US. Follow our latest updates on the coronavirus crisis Wednesday's number of deaths in Spain was marginally higher than the 849 announced the day before, and the country has now seen more than 800 deaths for five days in a row. But health officials believe the latest 12% increase in daily infections is further evidence that the rate has stabilised. Spain has been in lockdown for over two weeks, with further restrictions on movement introduced two days ago. But health services in the hardest-hit areas, including Madrid and Catalonia, are still struggling, with shortages of medical equipment a particular problem. In France two high-speed trains have been equipped to move patients infected with Covid-19 out of the Paris region Italy remains the worst-affected country, with a total of 105,792 confirmed cases and 13,155 deaths. Spain has 102,136 cases and 9,053 deaths. However, Italy has seen the daily rise in infection rates fall to less than 3%, well down on a few days ago. The number of deaths in the US has now topped 4,000, and Iran says Covid-19 - the disease caused by coronavirus - has claimed 3,000 lives. Belgium said more than half its intensive care beds were occupied as it reported a rise of 123 deaths, bringing the country's death toll to 828. Meanwhile France reported 509 deaths from Coronavirus in the last 24 hours, bringing the total to 4,032. It is the fourth country to record more than 4,000 fatalities after Italy, Spain and the US. The total number of confirmed cases is now 56,989, up about 9% from Tuesday. The UK on Wednesday recorded 563 deaths in 24 hours - it is the first time its daily toll has been higher than France's. However Britain's overall death toll, 2,352, is still lower. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? AVOIDING CONTACT:Should I self-isolate? STRESS:How to protect your mental health MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak Speaking at the UN headquarters in New York Mr Guterres said: ""The new coronavirus disease is attacking societies at their core, claiming lives and people's livelihoods"". He said it could bring a recession ""that probably has no parallel in the recent past"". ""Covid-19 is the greatest test that we have faced together since the formation of the United Nations,"" he said, calling for ""an immediate co-ordinated health response to suppress transmission and end the pandemic"".

There is an unseemly competition for scarce medical equipment. But experts at the Rusi think-tank in London are already looking to the future. They argue the world needs a whole new kind of institution to deal with so-called ""black sky hazards"" - natural or man-made disasters that are of such a scale that they disrupt the whole global system of interdependent supply chains on which human life depends. The authors, Karin von Hippel and Randolph Kent, say there is no current organisation to coordinate the sharing of information and policy options in the way that the World Health Organization covers public health. They suggest a new body established by the UN, but not part of it, to provide a forum for promoting discourse and solutions for ever more entangled problems of global consequence.

US considers cloth face masks for public,"This video can not be played When asked about the scarcity of masks, Donald Trump suggested scarves as protection against Covid-19 US health authorities are debating whether to recommend face coverings for everyone when they go out in public. One internal memo for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that even simple cloth masks could help reduce the risk of virus transmission, the Washington Post reports. President Donald Trump has suggested that individuals could ""use a scarf"". Current guidelines say that masks only need to be worn by healthcare workers, the sick, and those caring for them. There is currently a shortage of N95 and surgical masks in the US, with healthcare workers saying they have been told to reuse masks several times, or use bandanas when masks are not available. There have been over 190,000 cases of coronavirus in the US, with about 4,000 deaths. In other developments on Wednesday: US Vice-President Mike Pence warned the US appears to be on a similar trajectory as Italy, which has had the most deaths of any country In the UK, Wimbledon tennis tournament has been cancelled for the first time since World War Two British government officials vowed to ramp up testing within weeks Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has promised the largest economic programme in the country's history The official death toll in Iran has passed 3,000 The Washington Post obtained memos from the CDC,external, which said that cloth masks could help prevent the spread of the virus if people wore them in public, even during simple tasks like visiting the supermarket. The advice is being shared with the White House coronavirus task force for their consideration, the Washington Post reports. While there has been no change to the official guidance yet, there has been a clear change in tone from officials over the last few days. 'You prepare for the worst as a nurse but not this' Why some countries wear face masks and others don't Coronavirus: Who should be wearing masks? Back in February, Surgeon General Jerome Adams had tweeted: ""STOP BUYING MASKS! They are NOT effective in preventing general public from catching #Coronavirus, but if healthcare providers can't get them to care for sick patients, it puts them and our communities at risk!"" He also said in an interview that individuals could ""increase [their] risk of getting"" the virus by wearing a mask, because ""folks who don't know how to wear them properly tend to touch their faces a lot"". However, on Wednesday, Dr Adams told Good Morning America that the CDC had been asked to review its guidelines on masks, because ""we've learned there's a fair amount of asymptomatic spread"" - although he stressed that medical masks should still be left to health care professionals who needed them most. This video can not be played Coronavirus: Lack of medical supplies 'a national shame' Similarly, on Tuesday, the US's top infectious diseases expert, Anthony Fauci, said the White House coronavirus task force was actively discussing whether to recommend a wider use of masks, Dr Fauci told CNN,externalhe would ""lean towards"" recommending a ""much more broad, community-wide use of masks outside of the health care setting"" once there was a sufficient supply of masks for healthcare workers. However, experts have stressed that it is vital to maintain social distancing measures and thorough hand washing, even when wearing a mask. There have been a lot of confusing, or contradictory, messages on this. Even Dr Fauci acknowledged on Tuesday that ""this whole thing of masks has been confounded and conflated to create confusion"". Essentially, there are three different issues that have been linked together, causing that confusion: Whether masks work at reducing transmissions Whether masks are effective enough at preventing community spread to justify them being used by the general public, and; How to address the shortage of supplies for healthcare workers On the first point: Coronavirus is spread by droplets that can spray into the air when those infected talk, cough and sneeze. As a result, healthcare workers who are at risk of encountering infected airborne droplets are told to wear N95 masks, which filter out at least 95% of airborne particles, or, if those are not available, surgical masks. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? US v ITALY v CHINA:How do death rates compare? LEADING THE WAY:The US governor who saw it coming early ON FRONTLINE:'Nurses prepare for the worst but not this' REASON TO HOPE:The good that may come out of this crisis There is debate amongst health experts on the second point - whether masks are effective when used by the public. Many have argued that hand-washing and social distancing are more effective, that masks could offer a false sense of security, and that people could infect themselves if they touch the masks incorrectly. Experts have also argued there is no clear evidence that face masks work when used by the wider community. However, more and more health experts now say there are benefits. They argue that the public use of masks can primarily help by preventing asymptomatic patients - people who have been infected with Covid-19 but are not aware, and not displaying any symptoms - from unknowingly spreading the virus to others. Masks may help lower the risk of individuals catching the virus through the droplets from another person's sneeze or a cough - and people can be taught how put masks on and take them off correctly. Experts have also argued that even small measures to reduce transmissions can be worth taking, especially when combined with other steps such as hand washing. This video can not be played US death rates v UK, Italy and South Korea ""Something doesn't have to be 100% effective to be beneficial,"" Dr Fauci told CNN. There is widespread agreement on point three - that while supplies are limited, medical face masks need to be left for those who need them the most, especially as healthcare workers play a vital role in protecting everyone. Dr Fauci said: ""If everyone wears masks then healthcare workers who need them may not get them."" But, he added, ""If you have enough masksâ¦ we may need to modify the stance on whether people should be wearing masks."" In recent days, health experts have started suggesting a new approach - that the public should try to wear non-medical, cloth masks - which they could even make themselves - to help flatten the curve without using up medical supplies. In some parts of Asia everyone now wears a mask by default - it is seen as safer and more considerate. In mainland China, Hong Kong, Japan, Thailand and Taiwan, the broad assumption is that anyone could be a carrier of the virus, even healthy people. So in the spirit of solidarity, you need to protect others from yourself. Some of these governments are urging everyone to wear a mask, and in some parts of China you could even be arrested and punished for not wearing one.

'Unacceptable' for banks to deny companies help,"This video can not be played Business Secretary Alok Sharma: It's time for banks to ""repay the favour"" of the 2008 financial bailout Business Secretary Alok Sharma has issued a stark warning to banks, after concerns that up to a million companies could fold because they could be denied emergency loans. ""It would be completely unacceptable if any banks were unfairly refusing funds to good businesses in financial difficulty,"" Mr Sharma said. The government-backed loan scheme aims to ensure companies can access cash as the UK lockdown slows the economy. But some say loans have been denied. Speaking in Downing Street on Wednesday, Mr Sharma referenced the financial crisis - when the government bailed out a number of the UK's largest banks. ""Just as the taxpayer stepped in to help the banks back in 2008, we will work with the banks to do everything they can to repay that favour and support the businesses and people of the United Kingdom in their time of need,"" he said. A fifth of smaller firms 'will run out of cash' Banks under fire for coronavirus loan tactics Banks have been criticised by companies and MPs for insisting directors put their own property or savings up as collateral before they are approved for the emergency loans. Businesses have also complained of banks charging interest rates of up to 30%. The head of the Federation of Small Businesses, Mike Cherry, said banks were either trying to push firms towards ""standard, expensive products"" or they were ""simply not responsive"". ""We can't have a situation where banks are approached by successful small firms and lenders offer up business as usual products,"" he said. ""This is not business as usual."" ""They were promised interest-free, fee-free, government-backed support from banks,"" he said. He said millions of firms were at risk of collapsing because they were in need of urgent help that has not been made available. The Treasury is preparing to change the rules that govern its emergency loans scheme for businesses facing a cash-flow crisis because of the coronavirus shutdown. Many companies have told the BBC that the scheme isn't working for them, with some turned down for a government-backed loan and others told they may have to wait weeks. The planned rule change follows a furious behind-the-scenes row between the banks and the government over whose fault it is that too few emergency loans have been offered to businesses in need. Privately, the banks say it's the government's rules that are in the way. They are required to lend to firms on normal commercial terms if they can - and only businesses that can't get a traditional loan qualify for the scheme. But the Treasury is now reportedly planning to scrap that rule so that banks can lend faster. Another obstacle has been the demand from banks that company directors put their own assets at risk by signing personal guarantees when borrowing Â£250,000 or more. That is also expected to be addressed. Research from a network of accountants suggested that nearly a fifth of Britain's small and medium-sized businesses were unlikely to get the cash they need to survive the next month, under the existing scheme. The study said that between 800,000 and a million firms nationwide may soon have to close. Acting leader of the Liberal Democrat's Sir Ed Davey said: ""At a time when the whole country is coming together to fight Covid-19 it is becoming increasingly clear that the government cannot just leave the big banks to deliver the coronavirus business interruption loans. The big banks are simply not rising to the challenge. ""Too many small businesses report long delays, high interest terms and being asked for personal guarantees."" Banking trade body UK Finance said lenders were ""working hard"" to get money to businesses as quickly as possible both under the government-backed scheme or by offering normal loans. But the group stressed that banks could only offer loans on the government's terms if they were unable to lend ""under their normal criteria"". ""As the business secretary said today, this is a new scheme delivered at pace and there will be issues that need to be addressed,"" Stephen Jones, who runs the trade body, said. Rain Newton-Smith, chief economist at the CBI business lobby group, told the BBC's Today programme: ""I think everybody is trying their best to get the system up and running, but the system itself is too complicated. ""What we really need to see is the Treasury listening to what businesses and banks are saying to make it easier for these loans to be dispersed."" She added that the other challenge for business was that ""there's a whole range, what we call the 'stranded middle', who are too big for the government's short-term business interruption loans, but too small for the Bank of England's commercial paper"". ""These are big regional employers, from Cumbria to Coventry, and we just cannot afford to lose them just because they have a turnover of more than Â£45m.""

A fifth of smaller firms 'will run out of cash' Banks under fire for coronavirus loan tactics Banks have been criticised by companies and MPs for insisting directors put their own property or savings up as collateral before they are approved for the emergency loans. Businesses have also complained of banks charging interest rates of up to 30%. The head of the Federation of Small Businesses, Mike Cherry, said banks were either trying to push firms towards ""standard, expensive products"" or they were ""simply not responsive"". ""We can't have a situation where banks are approached by successful small firms and lenders offer up business as usual products,"" he said. ""This is not business as usual."" ""They were promised interest-free, fee-free, government-backed support from banks,"" he said. He said millions of firms were at risk of collapsing because they were in need of urgent help that has not been made available. The Treasury is preparing to change the rules that govern its emergency loans scheme for businesses facing a cash-flow crisis because of the coronavirus shutdown. Many companies have told the BBC that the scheme isn't working for them, with some turned down for a government-backed loan and others told they may have to wait weeks. The planned rule change follows a furious behind-the-scenes row between the banks and the government over whose fault it is that too few emergency loans have been offered to businesses in need. Privately, the banks say it's the government's rules that are in the way. They are required to lend to firms on normal commercial terms if they can - and only businesses that can't get a traditional loan qualify for the scheme. But the Treasury is now reportedly planning to scrap that rule so that banks can lend faster. Another obstacle has been the demand from banks that company directors put their own assets at risk by signing personal guarantees when borrowing Â£250,000 or more. That is also expected to be addressed. Research from a network of accountants suggested that nearly a fifth of Britain's small and medium-sized businesses were unlikely to get the cash they need to survive the next month, under the existing scheme. The study said that between 800,000 and a million firms nationwide may soon have to close. Acting leader of the Liberal Democrat's Sir Ed Davey said: ""At a time when the whole country is coming together to fight Covid-19 it is becoming increasingly clear that the government cannot just leave the big banks to deliver the coronavirus business interruption loans. The big banks are simply not rising to the challenge. ""Too many small businesses report long delays, high interest terms and being asked for personal guarantees."" Banking trade body UK Finance said lenders were ""working hard"" to get money to businesses as quickly as possible both under the government-backed scheme or by offering normal loans. But the group stressed that banks could only offer loans on the government's terms if they were unable to lend ""under their normal criteria"". ""As the business secretary said today, this is a new scheme delivered at pace and there will be issues that need to be addressed,"" Stephen Jones, who runs the trade body, said. Rain Newton-Smith, chief economist at the CBI business lobby group, told the BBC's Today programme: ""I think everybody is trying their best to get the system up and running, but the system itself is too complicated. ""What we really need to see is the Treasury listening to what businesses and banks are saying to make it easier for these loans to be dispersed."" She added that the other challenge for business was that ""there's a whole range, what we call the 'stranded middle', who are too big for the government's short-term business interruption loans, but too small for the Bank of England's commercial paper"". ""These are big regional employers, from Cumbria to Coventry, and we just cannot afford to lose them just because they have a turnover of more than Â£45m.""

UK government defends PM's use of ZoomA source says the app was quick to set up for self-isolating ministers without access to more secure tools.,"The UK government has defended using Zoom to hold cabinet video conferences. Questions had been raised about potential security risks after the prime minister tweeted a picture in which a meeting ID was visible. ""In the current unprecedented circumstances, the need for effective channels of communication is vital,"" a government spokeswoman told BBC News A source added the app was quick to set up between the varying systems used by different government departments. Over time, a more coherent system was expected to be introduced, the person said. Zoom has become widely used by individuals, companies and schools. But questions have been raised about its use by governments, amid fears others could spy on conversations. ""Covid-19 has created - and continues to create - awe-inspiring intelligence-collection opportunities,"" says Thomas Rid, at Johns Hopkins University. ""Zoom would be a big part of that intelligence bonanza."" The UK government does have highly secure video teleconferencing at key sites, including the intelligence agencies. This can be used for ""top secret"" conversations. It has also been rolling out a system called Rosa for secret-level working more broadly across government. But a number of members of the Cabinet have been self-isolating at their houses, which are not equipped with these systems. These ministers have needed to communicate with their staff and attend cabinet meetings. And that has left little option but to use commercial systems, of which Zoom has become the most popular. ""NCSC [National Cyber Security Centre] guidance shows there is no security reason for Zoom not to be used for meetings of this kind,"" the government spokeswoman said. Security researchers have been examining Zoom for flaws. Among their discoveries are: earlier versions of the appused to send analytics data to Facebook,externalwithout making this clear to users the product does not use end-to-end encryption,as had been claimed,external, which would have made it impossible for the developer to listen in to chats the softwaresometimes exposes people's email addresses and photos,externalto strangers On Tuesday, details of a issue that couldexpose Windows passwords was reported,external. And this Wednesday, a former US government hackerpublished details of two newly disclosed vulnerabilities,externalthat he said could be exploited on Mac computers. ""Though Zoom is incredibly popular, it has a rather dismal security and privacy track record,""blogged former US National Security Agency employee Patrick Wardle,external. In response, Zoom told BBC News it ""takes its users' privacy, security, and trust extremely seriously"". A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash In a crisis, communication at speed is the priority. And UK officials say the risks of not communicating in the middle of fast-moving events far outweigh the possible security risks of using such a system. They add most government work to do with the coronavirus is unclassified and anything highly classified is communicated over secure systems Government meetings use the paid-for version of the system and are password protected to prevent ""Zoom-bombing"", when uninvited individuals intrude on calls. The UK Ministry of Defence also said Zoom should not be used for classified conversations. And it is understood Nato's policy not to use Zoom for any meetings, briefings or conversations between member state ambassadors if classified or sensitive information is shared.

Virus is greatest test since WW2 - UN,"Coronavirus awareness campaigns have been held in a number of countries around the world The current coronavirus outbreak is the biggest challenge for the world since World War Two, UN Secretary General AntÃ³nio Guterres has warned. He said it could bring a recession ""that probably has no parallel in the recent past"". His warning comes amid dire predictions about the possible economic impact of measures imposed to fight the virus. The number of confirmed cases around the world is now nearing 860,000, with more than 42,000 deaths. The death toll in the US is now more than 4,000 - higher than the declared number of fatalities in China, where the outbreak began late last year. Johns Hopkins University said 865 people had died in the past 24 hours in the US and in all more than 189,000 people in the country had been infected. Live: Latest updates on the coronavirus crisis Trump extends US virus guidelines to end of April Trump backs away from New York 'quarantine' About three out of four Americans are now, or about to be, under some form of lockdown,as more US states tighten measures to fight the coronavirus, which causes the Covid-19 disease. Meanwhile, Spain, second only to Italy in the number of recorded fatalities, has seen 849 deaths in the last 24 hours - the highest number it has had in a single day. In the UK, a total of 1,789 people have died - a rise of 381, officials say.Among the victims was a 13-year-old boy,King's College Hospital Trust in London said. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? AVOIDING CONTACT:Should I self-isolate? STRESS:How to protect your mental health MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak Speaking at the UN headquarters in New York at the launch of a report on the potential socioeconomic impact of the outbreak, Mr Guterres said: ""The new coronavirus disease is attacking societies at their core, claiming lives and people's livelihoods"". AntÃ³nio Guterres: ""What the world needs now is solidarity."" Countries around the world have imposed a series of measures, including restricting people's movements and closing most businesses, to curb the spread of the virus. The UN report estimates that up to 25 million jobs could be lost around the world as the result of the outbreak. It also projects an up to 40% ""downward pressure"" on global foreign direct investment flows. ""Covid-19 is the greatest test that we have faced together since the formation of the United Nations,"" he said, calling for ""an immediate co-ordinated health response to suppress transmission and end the pandemic"". This video can not be played US death rates v UK, Italy and South Korea Mr Guterres urged the industrialised nations to help those less developed, or potentially ""face the nightmare of the disease spreading like wildfire"". On Tuesday,the World Bank warned that ""significant economic pain""seemed ""unavoidable in all countries"", and households that depend on industries particularly vulnerable to the impact of the virus were at ""higher risk"". This video can not be played Why staying at home in is a matter of life and death Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump told Americans to prepare themselves for ""a very, very painful two weeks"", as modelling by the White House's coronavirus task force estimated that at least 100,000 could die in the coming months. Infectious diseases adviser Anthony Fauci said that ""as sobering a number as that is, we should be prepared for it"", while stressing that authorities were doing their utmost to prevent it. President Donald Trump had already announced the need to significantly extend social distancing guidelines beyond the two weeks just completed, saying people would need to stay at home as much as they possibly could for another month. At Tuesday's White House briefing he turned the microphone over to his medical experts to help him persuade Americans to comply. They explained that the aim was to bring down the number of new cases in the hotspots, especially New York, and prevent runaway outbreaks in other states. Infectious disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci said steps taken so far had already begun to have an effect, and now was not the time to take the foot off the accelerator. But even with strict measures the White House is projecting that between 100,000 and 240,000 Americans will die of the coronavirus pandemic. New York will be the first to feel the brunt of that. It's focused on preparing enough beds and getting enough medical equipment for when the number of cases reaches its peak - in about two weeks' time. Italyremains the worst affected country in the world. Tuesday's figures show the official death toll rose by 837 deaths to 12,428, more than the 812 recorded on Monday. The number of new infections was 2,107, which was higher than the previous day, but a marked decline on numbers a few days ago. Francehas recorded 499 new hospital deaths in the last 24 hours, bringing the total to 3,523. This is the highest daily rise in such deaths in France since the outbreak began A 12-year-old girl has died inBelgium.She is thought to be the youngest Covid-19 victim in Europe.

No sugar-coating: Trump changes tack,"Both President Trump (left) and Dr Fauci acknowledged the seriousness of the situation There was no sugar-coating it this time. No optimistic talk of miracle cures or Easter-time business re-openings. There was just the cold, hard reality of the facts on the ground. ""I want every American to be prepared for the hard days that lie ahead,"" a grave-faced Donald Trump said in his Tuesday afternoon press conference. ""This is going to be a very, very painful two weeks."" Trump extends US virus guidelines to end of April Trump backs away from New York 'quarantine' How painful? When the president was asked how many Americans are currently projected to die from the virus given even the current mitigation efforts, he said it was better if his medical experts responded. The number of deaths, based on current projections, is between 100,000 and 200,000. On 15 April, for instance, 2,214 Americans are expected to die. This video can not be played When asked about the scarcity of masks, Donald Trump suggests scarves as protection against Covid-19 ""No-one is denying that we're going through a very, very difficult time,"" said Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. ""That's what it is."" The president tried to frame this news as best he could, noting that the projections for US casualties if the government had done nothing were in the millions. ""A lot of people were saying think of it as the flu, but it's not the flu,"" he said. ""It's vicious."" Refrigeration units are being used as makeshift morgues in New York City - the worst hit place in the US Of course, it was just a week ago the president himself was making exactly such comparisons, noting that the early fatality numbers were much less than those from the flu or even automobile accidents. ""We lose thousands of people a year to the flu,"" he said then. ""We never turn the country off."" Three out of four Americans under some form of lockdown What this crisis reveals about US and Trump Now, however, the seriousness of the situation has hit home. He spoke of checking in on a friend who was in the hospital with the virus -  ""a little older, and he's heavy, but he's tough person"" - only to find out he was now in a coma. ""I spoke to some of my friends, and they can't believe what they're seeing,"" he said. This video can not be played US death rates v UK, Italy and South Korea Mr Trump's change of attitude also extended to some of his recent political feuds. Just days after attacking Democratic Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, mocking her name and calling her incompetent on Twitter, the president said he had a ""really great conversation"" with her and detailed the support the federal government was providing her state. Last Friday, he had suggested that if state leaders were not ""appreciative"" of him, he wouldn't talk to them. On Tuesday, he recounted conversations with Democratic governors in California and Louisiana. There was still a veiled shot at New York and its Democratic governor Andrew Cuomo, however, as the president suggested that both his state and New Jersey - the two hardest hit in the US - ""got off to a very late start"" with their pandemic response. Trump also pushed back against Cuomo's complaint earlier on Tuesday that states were being forced to bid against each other, and the federal government, on the ventilator market. ""They shouldn't be doing that,"" the president said. ""If that happens, they should be calling us. If they need them that badly, we know."" ""Some people frankly think they need them but they don't need them,"" he added. The new call from the White House was to continue the current mitigation efforts for an additional 30 days; that even if things go from bad to worse in the weeks to come, the efforts will pay off. It will, however, be a long, slow grind. ""There's no magic bullet,"" said Dr Deborah Birx, one of the experts on the US taskforce. ""There's no magic vaccine or therapy. Just behaviours,"" she said.

Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Each day, news of more deaths is a huge source of alarm to people across the country - as well as a tragedy for the families involved. Projections of how bad the outbreak could get have prompted ministers to put the country into lockdown. But what are death figures really telling us? And how bad is it going to get?

Russell FullerBBC tennis correspondent Wimbledon has been cancelled for the first time since World War Two because of the coronavirus pandemic. The tournament was due to be played between 29 June and 12 July. The entire grass court season has been abandoned, and there will be no professional tennis anywhere in the world until at least 13 July. Sowhere does that leave the sport for the rest of the year? Design and technology teachers at a school are producing protective face masks to be used by NHS staff. The masks will be worn by GPs and frontline staff going into homes where patients have tested positive for Covid-19. Each teacher at the independent Bryanston School, near Blandford, Dorset, is using a 3D printer at home to produce between 100-200 component parts, prior to final assembly of the masks. Christopher Mills, head of design & technology, said: ""We are pleased to be able to put our skills and equipment to good use."" Masks can help stop the spread of coronavirus, but only if they are used inthe right circumstances.  Signs have been put up tocreate a one-way system for pedestriansaround a village to avoid people getting too close during the pandemic. Bruce Eggeling, a parish councillor in Lower Heyford, Oxfordshire, put up the signs after noticing there were narrow spots on two routes around the village. People are being urged to stay two metres apart to help avoid spreading the virus. The signs ask people to walk in an anti-clockwise direction on a short loop and clockwise on a longer loop. BBC 1Xtra's DJ Ace says he's fully recovered after testing positive for coronavirus. The presenter ison the waiting list for a new kidney- meaning he's at a higher risk of getting severe symptoms from the virus. In an Instagram post he reassured people with underlying health problems that getting Covid-19 doesn't always mean ""the worst case scenario"". But he said it was important to ""do everything [experts] tell you to do"".  Chronic kidney disease ison the listof conditions considered ""higher risk"" by the government. Higher risk people are being ""strongly advised"" to followsocial distancing rules.  Rob StevensBBC News The British Boxing Board of Control ""may have to consider""running Covid-19 tests on fightersas part of medicals when boxing returns to action. The move would affect about 1,200 licensed boxers and it could also include trainers and cornermen. On Monday, boxing's governing body suspended all events until the end of May because of the coronavirus outbreak. Eighty members of the armed forceshave been drafted in to drive response vehicles and take calls for South Central Ambulance Service(SCAS). The service covers Berkshire, Buckinghamshire, Hampshire, Oxfordshire, Sussex and Surrey. SCAS said the extra support would help provide 20 to 30 more ambulances a day. It's to cope with an expected increase in demand due to the coronavirus outbreak. Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online A loss of smell or taste may be a sign that you have coronavirus, according to UK researchers. A team at King's College London looked at responses from more than 400,000 people reporting suspected Covid-19 symptoms to an app. But loss of smell and taste are also signs of other respiratory infections, such as the common cold. And experts say fever and cough remain the most important symptoms of the virus tolook out for and act upon. Rob EnglandBBC News London firefighters will help with ""a number of ambulance service roles"" in response to the coronavirus pandemic,the service has said,external. A brigade spokesman said up to 300 staff could drive ambulances and assist paramedics. It follows an agreement between nation fire service bodies to support local authorities and the NHS. Chief executive of London Ambulance Service, Garrett Emmerson, said the offer came as ""we and the rest of the NHS are facing the biggest public health challenge in our history."" ""As part of our preparations we must reach out to all our partners to help boost our response so we can continue to treat every patient who needs us during this difficult time."" Firefighters must have specific qualifications to be able to take on the new duties, including first aid care and use of defibrillators. Stephan ShemiltBBC Sport The coronavirus lockdown has hit the UK just as fans and players of all levels of cricket were gearing up for a new season. Across the globe, there has been no major action in any form of the game since 16 March, the longest gap between matches in 37 years. With so many questions about this summer, I've been looking at what problems could arise, possible solutions, andwhat is happening elsewhere in the cricketing world. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics Thelatest figures show 563 patients with coronavirus have died in a day, taking the total number of deaths in UK hospitals to 2,352. But the increases in the number of patients dying balances out with the below-average rises on Sunday and Monday. ""On average, over the last week, the number of new deaths has been growing just below a quarter every day - or doubling twice in a week. ""That's slightly slower than earlier in the epidemic but if that keeps up, we'd expect to see in the region of a thousand deaths a day by the weekend."" Hayaat Karim lives in Bradford along with his grandparents, parents, six siblings - two of who are married - and his three-year-old nephew.

In the meantime, stay safe. Liam BarnesBBC News Police in Derbyshire have been putting up posters on cars in response to the coronavirus lockdown. The safer neighbourhood policing team for Glossop said on Facebook it was putting the posters ""on vehicles in various locations in our area"". Derbyshire Police has since updated the image that was published on social media by the Glossop account earlier. The image above asking motorists to ""consider if you need to make your trip"" is the new version, with an older copy telling drivers they have been ""instructed to avoid all unnecessary travel""  no longer being used. NHS staff in parts of Yorkshire arebeing offered free busesto get home from work. The new shuttle services will take people home after shifts in Hull, Doncaster, Rotherham and Sheffield. First will run the South Yorkshire service, while Stagecoach is running the buses in Hull. Both companies said the buses were not for public use and people would have to show NHS ID cards to be allowed to travel. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Each day, news of more deaths is a huge source of alarm to people across the country - as well as a tragedy for the families involved. Projections of how bad the outbreak could get have prompted ministers to put the country into lockdown. But what are death figures really telling us? And how bad is it going to get? Readmy full article here. John BrayBBC News I've been to meet a locked-down restaurant owner who has delivered more than 3,500 meals to NHS staff at two hospitals in Warwickshire. Kelly Iles, from The Barn Kitchen in Coventry, has used food from her closed venue, while more than 700 people have also paid for meals for doctors and nurses via a link on her website. ""I've wiped out my entire business stock but I don't care,"" she said. ""I've accepted that I no longer own a restaurant. ""I don't know if I will come back out of this.But hey, so what, it's just bricks."" Gordon CoreraSecurity correspondent, BBC News The UK government hasdefended using Zoomto hold Cabinet video conferences. Questions had been raised about potential security risks after the Prime Minister tweeted a picture in which a meeting ID was visible. ""In the current unprecedented circumstances the need for effective channels of communication is vital,"" a government spokeswoman told the BBC. A source added the app was quick to set up for self-isolating ministers without access to more secure tools. Earlier we told you about thetwo sisters who've started a 'good news' newsletter to share positive storiesduring the coronavirus pandemic. Bethan and Holly Botterill, from Bugbrooke, Northamptonshire, began sharing stories after being fed up by ""negative"" stories dominating the news. Bethan and Holly Botterill created a positive newsletter The newsletter which is published every weekday has included stories about care home residents playing games and penguins exploring an empty aquarium. Bethan, 19, said: ""People need this kind of thing right now."" The sisters' newsletter was highlighted byBBC Local Radio Make A Difference campaign.

Russell FullerBBC tennis correspondent Wimbledon has been cancelled for the first time since World War Two because of the coronavirus pandemic. The tournament was due to be played between 29 June and 12 July. The entire grass court season has been abandoned, and there will be no professional tennis anywhere in the world until at least 13 July. Sowhere does that leave the sport for the rest of the year? Design and technology teachers at a school are producing protective face masks to be used by NHS staff. The masks will be worn by GPs and frontline staff going into homes where patients have tested positive for Covid-19. Each teacher at the independent Bryanston School, near Blandford, Dorset, is using a 3D printer at home to produce between 100-200 component parts, prior to final assembly of the masks. Christopher Mills, head of design & technology, said: ""We are pleased to be able to put our skills and equipment to good use."" Masks can help stop the spread of coronavirus, but only if they are used inthe right circumstances.  Signs have been put up tocreate a one-way system for pedestriansaround a village to avoid people getting too close during the pandemic. Bruce Eggeling, a parish councillor in Lower Heyford, Oxfordshire, put up the signs after noticing there were narrow spots on two routes around the village. People are being urged to stay two metres apart to help avoid spreading the virus. The signs ask people to walk in an anti-clockwise direction on a short loop and clockwise on a longer loop. BBC 1Xtra's DJ Ace says he's fully recovered after testing positive for coronavirus. The presenter ison the waiting list for a new kidney- meaning he's at a higher risk of getting severe symptoms from the virus. In an Instagram post he reassured people with underlying health problems that getting Covid-19 doesn't always mean ""the worst case scenario"". But he said it was important to ""do everything [experts] tell you to do"".  Chronic kidney disease ison the listof conditions considered ""higher risk"" by the government. Higher risk people are being ""strongly advised"" to followsocial distancing rules.  Rob StevensBBC News The British Boxing Board of Control ""may have to consider""running Covid-19 tests on fightersas part of medicals when boxing returns to action. The move would affect about 1,200 licensed boxers and it could also include trainers and cornermen. On Monday, boxing's governing body suspended all events until the end of May because of the coronavirus outbreak. Eighty members of the armed forceshave been drafted in to drive response vehicles and take calls for South Central Ambulance Service(SCAS). The service covers Berkshire, Buckinghamshire, Hampshire, Oxfordshire, Sussex and Surrey. SCAS said the extra support would help provide 20 to 30 more ambulances a day. It's to cope with an expected increase in demand due to the coronavirus outbreak. Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online A loss of smell or taste may be a sign that you have coronavirus, according to UK researchers. A team at King's College London looked at responses from more than 400,000 people reporting suspected Covid-19 symptoms to an app. But loss of smell and taste are also signs of other respiratory infections, such as the common cold. And experts say fever and cough remain the most important symptoms of the virus tolook out for and act upon. Rob EnglandBBC News London firefighters will help with ""a number of ambulance service roles"" in response to the coronavirus pandemic,the service has said,external. A brigade spokesman said up to 300 staff could drive ambulances and assist paramedics. It follows an agreement between nation fire service bodies to support local authorities and the NHS. Chief executive of London Ambulance Service, Garrett Emmerson, said the offer came as ""we and the rest of the NHS are facing the biggest public health challenge in our history."" ""As part of our preparations we must reach out to all our partners to help boost our response so we can continue to treat every patient who needs us during this difficult time."" Firefighters must have specific qualifications to be able to take on the new duties, including first aid care and use of defibrillators. Stephan ShemiltBBC Sport The coronavirus lockdown has hit the UK just as fans and players of all levels of cricket were gearing up for a new season. Across the globe, there has been no major action in any form of the game since 16 March, the longest gap between matches in 37 years. With so many questions about this summer, I've been looking at what problems could arise, possible solutions, andwhat is happening elsewhere in the cricketing world. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics Thelatest figures show 563 patients with coronavirus have died in a day, taking the total number of deaths in UK hospitals to 2,352. But the increases in the number of patients dying balances out with the below-average rises on Sunday and Monday. ""On average, over the last week, the number of new deaths has been growing just below a quarter every day - or doubling twice in a week. ""That's slightly slower than earlier in the epidemic but if that keeps up, we'd expect to see in the region of a thousand deaths a day by the weekend.""

UK government defends PM's use of Zoom,"The UK government has defended using Zoom to hold cabinet video conferences. Questions had been raised about potential security risks after the prime minister tweeted a picture in which a meeting ID was visible. ""In the current unprecedented circumstances, the need for effective channels of communication is vital,"" a government spokeswoman told BBC News A source added the app was quick to set up between the varying systems used by different government departments. Over time, a more coherent system was expected to be introduced, the person said. Zoom has become widely used by individuals, companies and schools. But questions have been raised about its use by governments, amid fears others could spy on conversations. ""Covid-19 has created - and continues to create - awe-inspiring intelligence-collection opportunities,"" says Thomas Rid, at Johns Hopkins University. ""Zoom would be a big part of that intelligence bonanza."" The UK government does have highly secure video teleconferencing at key sites, including the intelligence agencies. This can be used for ""top secret"" conversations. It has also been rolling out a system called Rosa for secret-level working more broadly across government. But a number of members of the Cabinet have been self-isolating at their houses, which are not equipped with these systems. These ministers have needed to communicate with their staff and attend cabinet meetings. And that has left little option but to use commercial systems, of which Zoom has become the most popular. ""NCSC [National Cyber Security Centre] guidance shows there is no security reason for Zoom not to be used for meetings of this kind,"" the government spokeswoman said. Security researchers have been examining Zoom for flaws. Among their discoveries are: earlier versions of the appused to send analytics data to Facebook,externalwithout making this clear to users the product does not use end-to-end encryption,as had been claimed,external, which would have made it impossible for the developer to listen in to chats the softwaresometimes exposes people's email addresses and photos,externalto strangers On Tuesday, details of a issue that couldexpose Windows passwords was reported,external. And this Wednesday, a former US government hackerpublished details of two newly disclosed vulnerabilities,externalthat he said could be exploited on Mac computers. ""Though Zoom is incredibly popular, it has a rather dismal security and privacy track record,""blogged former US National Security Agency employee Patrick Wardle,external.

And UK officials say the risks of not communicating in the middle of fast-moving events far outweigh the possible security risks of using such a system. They add most government work to do with the coronavirus is unclassified and anything highly classified is communicated over secure systems Government meetings use the paid-for version of the system and are password protected to prevent ""Zoom-bombing"", when uninvited individuals intrude on calls. The UK Ministry of Defence also said Zoom should not be used for classified conversations. And it is understood Nato's policy not to use Zoom for any meetings, briefings or conversations between member state ambassadors if classified or sensitive information is shared.

UK virus deaths exceed 500 in a day,"NHS workers have been tested at a drive-through site at an Ikea store in Wembley, north London The government is facing growing pressure to ramp up coronavirus testing, as the UK saw its biggest daily increase in deaths. Some 2,352 virus patients had died in hospital as of 17:00 on Tuesday - up 563 in a day,the latest figures show,external. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said testing was ""massively increasing"" and it was ""the way through"" the pandemic. Meanwhile a major international climate meeting,COP26, is the latest event to be postponed as a result of the virus. The climate talks were due to take place at Glasgow's Scottish Events Campus in November - which is being turned into a temporary field hospital to treat coronavirus patients. The UN's climate body, the UNFCCC, and the UK government said the summit would be pushed back to 2021. Ina video message posted on Twitter,external, the prime minister said Wednesday had been a ""sad, sad day"" due to the high number of deaths in the UK. Mr Johnson, who is self-isolating in Downing Street after contracting the virus, also reiterated the government's commitment to ""ramp up"" testing. He said: ""This is how we will unlock the coronavirus puzzle. This is how we will defeat it in the end."" The government has been under pressure to increase the screening of medics, so that those who are self-isolating unnecessarily can return to work. More than 3,500 NHS frontline staff in England and Wales have been tested for the virus since the outbreak began. But cabinet minister Michael Gove said a shortage of chemicals needed for the tests meant the NHS - which employs 1.2m in England - could not screen all workers. The prime minister's official spokesman said the government was working with NHS England, Public Health England and other organisations to boost test capacity with an additional network of labs and testing sites. Dr Yvonne Doyle, Public Health England medical director, told a daily coronavirus briefing in Downing Street that there was currently capacity for about 3,000 tests a day for frontline NHS staff. She said the ""intention"" was for testing for frontline staff to increase from ""thousands to hundreds of thousands within the coming weeks"". The World Health Organization has said the world is set to reach one million confirmed cases and 50,000 deaths worldwide in the next few days. Dr Doyle said the UK was not in ""as severe"" a position as Spain, the US or Italy, but added there was ""no reason to be complacent"". She said while the spread of the virus was most advanced in London, the Midlands was ""obviously a concern"" too. As of 9:00 on Wednesday, 152,979 people in the UK had been tested for the virus with 29,474 confirmed positive. This includes 4,139 cases in the Midlands and 8,341 in London. Dr Doyle added while use of public transport had gone down since the government enforced social distancing measures, an ""up-tick"" in motor vehicle use in the last 24 hours was ""slightly concerning"". She urged members of the public to stay home to ""protect the NHS"". The number of questions about the lack of testing at the daily press conference came as no surprise. The government has been heavily criticised for not increasing testing capacity more quickly. Dr Doyle said she was confident the UK would achieve the target of 25,000 tests a day by the end of the month. There is some way to go - over the past 24 hours just shy of 10,000 tests have been done. The lack of tests means NHS staff have had to self-isolate at home when members of their household show symptoms. News that there are going to be five drive-through centres for staff will also help. But it was interesting Dr Doyle was also asked by how much more testing can be increased by in the long-term. If the number of cases does come down, testing will play a crucial role in allowing the lockdown to be eased. The plan would be to contain the virus by testing lots of people quickly. That will require the UK to be able to tests hundreds of thousands of people a day. A doctor who came out of retirement to volunteer for the NHS has become the fourth UK medic to die with the virus, which causes the disease Covid-19. Dr Alfa Sa'adu, 68, had been volunteeringat Queen Victoria Memorial Hospital in Welwyn when he contracted coronavirus. His son Dani Saadu posted online that his dad had died after ""fighting the virus for two weeks"". ""My dad was a living legend, worked for the NHS for nearly 40 years saving people's lives here and in Africa,"" he said. The BBC's head of statistics Robert Cuffe said the latest increases in the number of patients dying with coronavirus balance out with the below-average rises on Sunday and Monday.

The prime minister's official spokesperson said the government was working with a number of suppliers which had come forward with offers of PPE, or proposals to manufacture more. It follows criticism from some frontline workers over the lack of protective equipment, with staff at one hospital in Essexwarning they could ""limit services""to patients with coronavirus ""to a bare minimum"" over fears for their own safety.

Missing teen 'on 280-mile trek to girlfriend',"Some of Owen's friends believe he may have tried to walk to Yorkshire to see girlfriend Meg, his mother said A teenager missing for six days may have tried to walk 280 miles to see his girlfriend, his mother has said. Owen Harding, 16, was last seen leaving his home in Saltdean, Sussex, last Thursday. His mum Stella said he had been upset at being unable to get a train to visit girlfriend Meg in Pocklington, near York, amid the coronavirus lockdown. She said relatives were desperately worried and urged the public to be on the lookout for Owen. In an earlier appeal over her son's disappearance -shared by family friend Nadia Sawalha- Ms Harding said he had left home to watch the sunset. Some of Owen's friends have since said they believe he has attempted to walk from Saltdean to the North, Ms Harding said. ""While it is extremely out of character for Owen to leave and not be in contact, Covid-19 has put everyone under lots of strain and we don't want to rule anything out,"" she said. ""Because search activity and resources are limited right now, I'm begging the UK public to look out for him whilst out on their daily walks. ""But please make sure that, in doing so, you adhere to social distancing and government guidance and do not put yourself or anyone else at risk."" Sussex Police said searches have taken place in the Saltdean and Telscombe cliffs area near Brighton. Det Ch Insp Alasdair Henry asked anyone who was driving near the cliffs last Thursday after 18:00 GMT to check if they had dashcam footage of Owen. He said police were keen to hear from anyone who could help, but echoed Ms Harding's request to abide by government guidance at all times. The force would link up with colleagues across the country if there was anything to suggest Owen had travelled out of Sussex, he added. Owen is described as white, between 5ft 11ins and 6ft, and of athletic build with short brown hair. Stella Harding said she was begging the UK public to look for him The teenager had been upset he couldn't get on a train to Yorkshire The appeal to find Owen has been shared by TV presenter and family friend Nadia Sawalha.

"NHS 111 has 1.7 million queries in 15 daysMost of the queries, from people flagging potential symptoms, were handled online.Health","In the past 15 days, NHS 111 has responded to more than 1.7 million inquiries from people concerned they might have symptoms of coronavirus. About 1.5 million were web-based assessments, while the rest were calls to the 111 phone number or 999. People who think they have symptoms - a fever or a new, continuous cough - should use the online service and call only if they cannot get help online. The NHS Digital data is not based on outcomes of tests for coronavirus. And the numbers do not represent individual people - it is possible some have sought help more than once or via various channels. Meanwhile, the government faces growing criticism over a lack of testing for front-line staff who could return to work if found clear of the virus. On Tuesday, Cabinet Office MinisterMichael Gove admitted the UK had to go ""further, faster"" to increase testing. It came as a13-year-old boy from south London with coronavirus died. Ismail Mohamed Abdulwahab, from Brixton, is thought to be the youngest reported victim of the disease in the UK. The total recorded number of UK deaths with coronavirus in hospitals now stands at 2,352, 563 more than yesterday. The Department of Health says 29,474 people have tested positive for the virus, up 4,324 since Tuesday.

How to understand the coronavirus death toll,"Each day, news of more deaths is distressing to people across the country - as well as a tragedy for the families involved. Projections of how bad the outbreak could get have prompted ministers to put the country into lockdown. But what are we learning about the impact of the virus and the deaths it is causing? The death figures being reported daily are hospital cases where a person dies with the coronavirus infection in their body - because it is a notifiable disease cases have to be reported. But what the figures do not tell us is to what extent the virus is causing the death. It could be the major cause, a contributory factor or simply present when they are dying of something else. For example, an 18-year-old in Coventry tested positive for coronavirus the day before he died and was reported as its youngest victim at the time. But the hospital subsequently released a statement saying his death had been due to a separate ""significant"" health condition and not connected to the virus. There are, however, other cases, including health workers, where people have died with no known health conditions. The Office for National Statisticshas tried to shed light on this,external. It looked at nearly 4,000 deaths in England and Wales during March. There were two main findings. Firstly, the virus was the cause of the majority of deaths, not other factors. But secondly, nine in 10 did have pre-existing illnesses, such as heart disease and respiratory problems that put them at heightened risk of death anyway. It is clear that the number of people who are dying is increasing. The ONS has started to track this as well on a weekly basis - and unlike the daily government figures, which largely focus on hospital deaths, it is taking into account deaths in the community. Themost recent data,externalgoes up to the start of April. It shows in the week ending 3 April there were 16,000 deaths - 6,000 more than could be expected at this time of the year when the number of deaths normally starts to fall with winter over. This is the highest death number since these figures were first published in 2005, more than the previous peak seen during the bad flu outbreak of 2015. Not all these extra deaths were down to coronavirus, but a significant number were. What we do not know is what will happen to these numbers in the future and whether in a few months time deaths will drop below expected levels. If that happened, it would suggest coronavirus has brought forward deaths that you would expect to happen over the course of the next year. Every year, about 600,000 people in the UK die. And the frail and elderly are most at risk, just as they are if they have coronavirus. Nearly 10% of people aged over 80 will die in the next year, Prof Sir David Spiegelhalter at the University of Cambridge points out, and the risk of them dying if infected with coronavirus is almost exactly the same. That does not mean there will be no extra deaths - but, Sir David says, there will be ""a substantial overlap"". ""Many people who die of Covid [the disease caused by coronavirus] would have died anyway within a short period,"" he says. Knowing exactly how many is impossible to tell at this stage. Prof Neil Ferguson, the lead modeller at Imperial College London, has suggested it could be up to two-thirds. But while deaths without the virus would be spread over the course of a year, those with the virus could come more quickly - that, of course, was the logic for the lockdown to stop the health service being overwhelmed. When it comes to flu, experts track what are called excess deaths. During recent winters, there have been about 17,000 excess deaths a year, Public Health England says. This, of course, can be done in the future only - it is why the ONS says it is too early to understand the true impact coronavirus is having on deaths. Work also needs to be done to calculate the indirect impact of coronavirus and the lockdown. The 6,000 extra weekly deaths identified by the ONS contained 2,500 which were not reported to be because of coronavirus infections. Experts have suggested they could be related to people being deterred from seeking treatment for medical emergencies such as strokes or heart attacks. This is why the UK government's chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty was stressing on Thursday the ""NHS was open for business"". Prof Robert Dingwall from Nottingham Trent University says there will certainly be ""collateral damage"" from other factors such as: mental health problems and suicides linked to self-isolation heart problems from lack of activity the impact on health from increased unemployment and reduced living standards Others have also pointed to the health cost from steps such as delaying routine operations and cancer screening. Meanwhile, University of Bristol researchers say the benefit of a long-term lockdown in reducing premature deaths could be outweighed by the lost life expectancy from a prolonged economic dip. And the tipping point, they say, is a 6.4% decline in the size of the economy - on a par with what happened following the 2008 financial crash. It would see a loss of three months of life on average across the population because of factors such declining living standards and poorer health care. The problem the government and its advisers face is that they cannot make decisions with the benefit of hindsight - they have to react to emerging evidence. Currently, the lockdown is aimed at suppressing the spread of the virus. Once the peak has passed decisions will have to be made about what to do next. The virus will not simply have gone away, and with a vaccine at least a year away the challenge will be how to manage it. A balance will need to be struck between keeping it at bay and trying to control its spread to avoid a second peak, while at the same time allowing the country to return to normal. Seeing the full picture in terms of lives saved and lives lost will be essential in getting those calls right. LATEST:Live coverage of developments EASY STEPS:What can I do?

"UK virus deaths exceed 500 in a dayUK coronavirus deaths rise by 563 in a day as No 10 says 2,000 NHS England staff have been tested.","NHS workers have been tested at a drive-through site at an Ikea store in Wembley, north London The government is facing growing pressure to ramp up coronavirus testing, as the UK saw its biggest daily increase in deaths. Some 2,352 virus patients had died in hospital as of 17:00 on Tuesday - up 563 in a day,the latest figures show,external. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said testing was ""massively increasing"" and it was ""the way through"" the pandemic. Meanwhile a major international climate meeting,COP26, is the latest event to be postponed as a result of the virus. The climate talks were due to take place at Glasgow's Scottish Events Campus in November - which is being turned into a temporary field hospital to treat coronavirus patients. The UN's climate body, the UNFCCC, and the UK government said the summit would be pushed back to 2021. Ina video message posted on Twitter,external, the prime minister said Wednesday had been a ""sad, sad day"" due to the high number of deaths in the UK. Mr Johnson, who is self-isolating in Downing Street after contracting the virus, also reiterated the government's commitment to ""ramp up"" testing. He said: ""This is how we will unlock the coronavirus puzzle. This is how we will defeat it in the end."" The government has been under pressure to increase the screening of medics, so that those who are self-isolating unnecessarily can return to work. More than 3,500 NHS frontline staff in England and Wales have been tested for the virus since the outbreak began. But cabinet minister Michael Gove said a shortage of chemicals needed for the tests meant the NHS - which employs 1.2m in England - could not screen all workers. The prime minister's official spokesman said the government was working with NHS England, Public Health England and other organisations to boost test capacity with an additional network of labs and testing sites. Dr Yvonne Doyle, Public Health England medical director, told a daily coronavirus briefing in Downing Street that there was currently capacity for about 3,000 tests a day for frontline NHS staff. She said the ""intention"" was for testing for frontline staff to increase from ""thousands to hundreds of thousands within the coming weeks"". The World Health Organization has said the world is set to reach one million confirmed cases and 50,000 deaths worldwide in the next few days. Dr Doyle said the UK was not in ""as severe"" a position as Spain, the US or Italy, but added there was ""no reason to be complacent"". She said while the spread of the virus was most advanced in London, the Midlands was ""obviously a concern"" too. As of 9:00 on Wednesday, 152,979 people in the UK had been tested for the virus with 29,474 confirmed positive. This includes 4,139 cases in the Midlands and 8,341 in London. Dr Doyle added while use of public transport had gone down since the government enforced social distancing measures, an ""up-tick"" in motor vehicle use in the last 24 hours was ""slightly concerning"". She urged members of the public to stay home to ""protect the NHS"". The number of questions about the lack of testing at the daily press conference came as no surprise. The government has been heavily criticised for not increasing testing capacity more quickly. Dr Doyle said she was confident the UK would achieve the target of 25,000 tests a day by the end of the month. There is some way to go - over the past 24 hours just shy of 10,000 tests have been done. The lack of tests means NHS staff have had to self-isolate at home when members of their household show symptoms. News that there are going to be five drive-through centres for staff will also help. But it was interesting Dr Doyle was also asked by how much more testing can be increased by in the long-term. If the number of cases does come down, testing will play a crucial role in allowing the lockdown to be eased. The plan would be to contain the virus by testing lots of people quickly. That will require the UK to be able to tests hundreds of thousands of people a day. A doctor who came out of retirement to volunteer for the NHS has become the fourth UK medic to die with the virus, which causes the disease Covid-19. Dr Alfa Sa'adu, 68, had been volunteeringat Queen Victoria Memorial Hospital in Welwyn when he contracted coronavirus. His son Dani Saadu posted online that his dad had died after ""fighting the virus for two weeks"". ""My dad was a living legend, worked for the NHS for nearly 40 years saving people's lives here and in Africa,"" he said. The BBC's head of statistics Robert Cuffe said the latest increases in the number of patients dying with coronavirus balance out with the below-average rises on Sunday and Monday. How to understand the coronavirus death toll He said the number of new deaths has been increasing at a slightly slower rate than earlier in the epidemic, ""but if that keeps up, we'd expect to see in the region of a thousand deaths a day by the weekend"".

The prime minister's official spokesperson said the government was working with a number of suppliers which had come forward with offers of PPE, or proposals to manufacture more. It follows criticism from some frontline workers over the lack of protective equipment, with staff at one hospital in Essexwarning they could ""limit services""to patients with coronavirus ""to a bare minimum"" over fears for their own safety.

NHS 111 has 1.7 million queries in 15 days,"In the past 15 days, NHS 111 has responded to more than 1.7 million inquiries from people concerned they might have symptoms of coronavirus. About 1.5 million were web-based assessments, while the rest were calls to the 111 phone number or 999. People who think they have symptoms - a fever or a new, continuous cough - should use the online service and call only if they cannot get help online. The NHS Digital data is not based on outcomes of tests for coronavirus. And the numbers do not represent individual people - it is possible some have sought help more than once or via various channels. Meanwhile, the government faces growing criticism over a lack of testing for front-line staff who could return to work if found clear of the virus. On Tuesday, Cabinet Office MinisterMichael Gove admitted the UK had to go ""further, faster"" to increase testing. It came as a13-year-old boy from south London with coronavirus died. Ismail Mohamed Abdulwahab, from Brixton, is thought to be the youngest reported victim of the disease in the UK. The total recorded number of UK deaths with coronavirus in hospitals now stands at 2,352, 563 more than yesterday. The Department of Health says 29,474 people have tested positive for the virus, up 4,324 since Tuesday.

Woman fined Â£660 for breaching coronavirus rules,"Marie Dinou was arrested at Newcastle Central Station on Saturday morning A woman has been fined for breaching coronavirus restrictions after she refused to tell police who she was and why she was at a railway station. Marie Dinou, 41, from York, was arrested at Newcastle Central Station at 08:00 GMT on Saturday. North Tyneside Magistrates' Court imposed a Â£660 fine under the Coronavirus Act 2020 on Monday. Dinou, who did not enter a plea, was also ordered to pay a victim surcharge of Â£66 and costs of Â£85. More from Yorkshire British Transport Police assistant chief constable Sean O'Callaghan said enforcement of the new legislation was a last resort. ""In this case, officers tried their utmost best to engage with Dinou. ""I can assure you we would much rather not have to take such action."" People risk committing an offence if they appear to be breaching restrictions laid out in the emergency legislation and fail to give a reasonable excuse when challenged.

Hospital staff could 'limit work' over protection,"Southend Hospital is closed to visitors, apart from in exceptional circumstances Staff at a hospital have warned they could ""limit services"" to patients with coronavirus ""to a bare minimum"", over fears for their own safety. In a letter to management, medics at Southend Hospital in Essex say they are not receiving the correct personal protective equipment (PPE). BBC Essex has been told that a quarter of Southend's medical staff are off sick with coronavirus symptoms. Hospital bosses say they are ""absolutely committed"" to staff safety. Coronavirus live page: Updates from across the East of England In the letter, clinicians at Southend A&E note: ""PPE is being rationed"", that ""there is limited stock"" and what is available is being ""locked away from staff and not accessible"" Staff are said to be ""petrified"" working in the hospital and claim that most have not been tested for the virus Staff also say that many ""are reluctant to work in this [high-risk] area"" because of safety issues ""but continue to do so as we have the welfare of our patients foremost"" They warn chief executive Clare Panniker that if the standard and availability of PPE is not improved by ""close of play"" on 1 April, they will introduce ""restricted services"" in high-risk areas of the hospital. Staff are said to be ""petrified"" at the lack of protective equipment during the coronavirus crisis In a statement, Southend Hospital said: ""We are fully complying with the Public Health England guidance on the use of personal protective equipment which has been developed by expert clinicians and is being followed by the whole of the NHS. ""There are no issues whatsoever with the cost of equipment. It has been made clear that cost is not an issue in keeping our staff protected. What is important is that the supplies of PPE equipment across the NHS are used responsibly so there is enough to go round."" A source at Basildon Hospital - which along with Chelmsford's Broomfield Hospital shares Southend's senior management team and CEO - says that there is a good supply of PPE there, but that they have heard of supply issues at Southend Hospital.

Coronavirus outbreak 'greatest test since WW2',"Coronavirus awareness campaigns have been held in a number of countries around the world The current coronavirus outbreak is the biggest challenge for the world since World War Two, UN Secretary General AntÃ³nio Guterres has warned. He said it could bring a recession ""that probably has no parallel in the recent past"". His warning comes amid dire predictions about the possible economic impact of measures imposed to fight the virus. The number of confirmed cases around the world is now nearing 860,000, with more than 42,000 deaths. The death toll in the US is now more than 4,000 - higher than the declared number of fatalities in China, where the outbreak began late last year. Johns Hopkins University said 865 people had died in the past 24 hours in the US and in all more than 189,000 people in the country had been infected. Live: Latest updates on the coronavirus crisis Trump extends US virus guidelines to end of April Trump backs away from New York 'quarantine' About three out of four Americans are now, or about to be, under some form of lockdown,as more US states tighten measures to fight the coronavirus, which causes the Covid-19 disease. Meanwhile, Spain, second only to Italy in the number of recorded fatalities, has seen 849 deaths in the last 24 hours - the highest number it has had in a single day. In the UK, a total of 1,789 people have died - a rise of 381, officials say.Among the victims was a 13-year-old boy,King's College Hospital Trust in London said. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? AVOIDING CONTACT:Should I self-isolate? STRESS:How to protect your mental health MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak Speaking at the UN headquarters in New York at the launch of a report on the potential socioeconomic impact of the outbreak, Mr Guterres said: ""The new coronavirus disease is attacking societies at their core, claiming lives and people's livelihoods"". AntÃ³nio Guterres: ""What the world needs now is solidarity."" Countries around the world have imposed a series of measures, including restricting people's movements and closing most businesses, to curb the spread of the virus. The UN report estimates that up to 25 million jobs could be lost around the world as the result of the outbreak. It also projects an up to 40% ""downward pressure"" on global foreign direct investment flows. ""Covid-19 is the greatest test that we have faced together since the formation of the United Nations,"" he said, calling for ""an immediate co-ordinated health response to suppress transmission and end the pandemic"". This video can not be played US death rates v UK, Italy and South Korea Mr Guterres urged the industrialised nations to help those less developed, or potentially ""face the nightmare of the disease spreading like wildfire"". On Tuesday,the World Bank warned that ""significant economic pain""seemed ""unavoidable in all countries"", and households that depend on industries particularly vulnerable to the impact of the virus were at ""higher risk"". This video can not be played Why staying at home in is a matter of life and death Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump told Americans to prepare themselves for ""a very, very painful two weeks"", as modelling by the White House's coronavirus task force estimated that at least 100,000 could die in the coming months. Infectious diseases adviser Anthony Fauci said that ""as sobering a number as that is, we should be prepared for it"", while stressing that authorities were doing their utmost to prevent it. President Donald Trump had already announced the need to significantly extend social distancing guidelines beyond the two weeks just completed, saying people would need to stay at home as much as they possibly could for another month. At Tuesday's White House briefing he turned the microphone over to his medical experts to help him persuade Americans to comply. They explained that the aim was to bring down the number of new cases in the hotspots, especially New York, and prevent runaway outbreaks in other states. Infectious disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci said steps taken so far had already begun to have an effect, and now was not the time to take the foot off the accelerator. But even with strict measures the White House is projecting that between 100,000 and 240,000 Americans will die of the coronavirus pandemic. New York will be the first to feel the brunt of that. It's focused on preparing enough beds and getting enough medical equipment for when the number of cases reaches its peak - in about two weeks' time. Italyremains the worst affected country in the world. Tuesday's figures show the official death toll rose by 837 deaths to 12,428, more than the 812 recorded on Monday. The number of new infections was 2,107, which was higher than the previous day, but a marked decline on numbers a few days ago. Francehas recorded 499 new hospital deaths in the last 24 hours, bringing the total to 3,523. This is the highest daily rise in such deaths in France since the outbreak began A 12-year-old girl has died inBelgium.She is thought to be the youngest Covid-19 victim in Europe.

A fifth of smaller firms 'will run out of cash',"Nearly a fifth of all small and medium-sized businesses in the UK are unlikely to get the cash they need to survive the next four weeks, in spite of unprecedented government support. That's according to research from a network of accountants which suggests between 800,000 and a million firms nationwide may soon have to close. Many firms have told the BBC that banks have refused them emergency loans. The banks say they are following the rules set out by the government. Banks under fire for coronavirus loan tactics Chancellor Rishi Sunak said two weeks ago that businesses would be able to walk into bank branches and discuss Coronavirus Business Interruption Loans (CBILs) of up to Â£5m to help them survive the shutdown. The promise from the chancellor was that ""any good business in financial difficulty who needs access to cash to pay their rent, the salaries of their employees, pay suppliers, or purchase stock, will be able to access a government-backed loan, on attractive terms"". However, thousands of struggling firms can't get through to their banks by phone or, when they do, are being told by the banks they're not eligible. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan told BBC Radio 5 live that ""banks have got to step up"" to help small and medium-sized businesses survive during the coronavirus pandemic. Steve Lord runs Belgrave & Powell, a Nottingham-based engineering group employing 120 people and supplying services to customers such as BAE's Samlesbury site, where the F-35 and Typhoon fighter jets are made. Since Salmesbury halted production, his business - like millions of others - is facing the prospect of cash drying up, threatening its ability to pay wages and stay afloat. ""I was heartened and astonished to see the unprecedented help that was announced by the government two weeks ago,"" he said. ""But we put one of our most senior people on it and as each day passed it was disappointment after disappointment."" He said some of the approved lenders were demanding interest rates of up to 30%, which Mr Lord believes is ""taking advantage of the situation"". Meanwhile, he said, High Street banks were charging around 7%, however he was told it could be as long as a month before his firm got the money. Mr Lord thinks too much control has been handed to the banks and approved lenders: ""The government needs to make it so everyone's offering the same terms."" ""It seems to be that if you are lucky you are banking with the right party, if you're not lucky you'll end up having to close your business."" Another business owner, Peter Jackson - who runs jewellery shops employing 40 people across the north-west of England - said his bank decided he was ineligible because the firm made a small loss in 2019. But Mr Jackson said his business was viable before the shutdown and expected to make a profit this year. It also owns valuable stock. ""I thought the whole point of the loans was to help business like mine stay afloat,"" he said. ""But they're not going to help."" The figures identifying how many businesses would not be able to access cash come from a network of accountants serving more than 12,000 small and medium-sized businesses across the country called the Corporate Finance Network. After analysing the government help on offer, those accountants say that 18% of their clients were unlikely to get access to the cash they will need to survive a four-week lockdown. The findings echo similar reports from other business groups, estimating that up to a fifth of businesses could close if the lockdown lasts a month or more. Bank say they're following rules set by the government, which mean firms can only get the emergency loans if they can't borrow in a normal commercial way, like borrowing against the value of a property. Businesses wanting to borrow more than Â£250,000 are being told by banks that directors must sign personal guarantees. That means if the loan goes bad owing to a prolonged shutdown, their personal property is on the line. Under CBILs,  a business owner's primary residence is protected but other personal assets could be recovered if the company cannot keep up repayments. Under normal commercial lending, personal guarantees may also put the owner's home at risk if the loan goes bad. Joshua Wade runs a fast-growing ethical cosmetics business, Skin and Tonic, founded by his partner Sarah Hancock in 2015. He said lenders were insisting on early repayment penalties as well as personal guarantees. Skin & Tonic was founded in 2015 by Sarah Hancock, Joshua's partner ""The Business Interruption Loan Scheme is, in principle, very welcome support right now,"" he said. ""But the huge barrier for us is the requirement for all directors to give personal guarantees. As founders and executive directors, we already are risking everything but we simply can't ask our non-executive directors to take that risk on in such challenging and uncertain times."" A spokesperson for UK Finance, the bank trade body, said: ""Lenders are working hard to get financing to all businesses who need it as quickly as possible and are using the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme (CBILS) where appropriate, with some funding having already been provided under the scheme. This video can not be played Mayor of London Sadiq Khan says ""banks have got to step up"" to help businesses survive. ""All lenders will take into account a business's individual circumstances when considering applications and many business loans can be provided either unsecured or secured on business assets."" Kirsty McGregor, founder of the Corporate Finance Network, told the BBC: ""Small and medium-sized businesses employing less than 250 people employ most of the workforce - 23 million people. ""We could lose up to a million of them in the next month or so. And it will be irreversible which will be catastrophic for the UK economy."" Ms McGregor suggested the government needs to encourage small businesses to take over companies going bust in their area so employees can still be paid. A spokesman for the Treasury said: ""The chancellor has been clear that banks should support small and medium-sized businesses during these difficult times. ""That is why we're taking unprecedented action to support firms, jobs and our economy through Â£330bn in business loans and guarantees, paying 80% of the wages of furloughed workers for three months, VAT and tax deferrals, introducing cash grants of up to Â£25,000 for small companies and covering the cost of statutory sick pay. ""We're working with the financial services sector to ensure that companies feel the full benefits from this support.""

Zoom under increased scrutiny as popularity soars,"The videoconferencing app Zoom has come under fresh high-level scrutiny as its popularity soars during the coronavirus pandemic. New York's attorney general has written to the firm raising concerns over its ability to cope with the rise in users. Zoom is now being used by millions of people for work and leisure, as lockdowns are imposed in many countries. But its data security and privacy measures have been questioned. The letter from the office of New York Attorney General Letitia James asked Zoom whether it had reviewed its security measures since its popularity surged. It also pointed out that in the past the app had been slow to address issues. In response to a request from the BBC for comment, a company spokesperson said: ""Zoom takes its users' privacy, security, and trust extremely seriously. ""During the Covid-19 pandemic, we are working around-the-clock to ensure that hospitals, universities, schools, and other businesses across the world can stay connected and operational. We appreciate the New York Attorney General's engagement on these issues and are happy to provide her with the requested information,"" it added. Zoom is in everyone's living room - how safe is it? Racist 'zoombombing' during synagogue meeting Laid off over Zoom: Firms cut staff by conference call Users have flocked to Zoom as governments around the world ordered large parts of their populations to stay at home to slow the spread of the virus. It is now ranked as the number two and number one app in the UK and US, respectively. Zoom has had security flaws in the past, including a vulnerability which allowed an attacker to remove attendees from meetings, spoof messages from users and hijack shared screens. Another saw Mac users forced into calls without their knowledge. It also doesn't offer end-to-end encryption, according to online news publication The Intercept. This is encryption that should mean no-one other than participants can see a meeting. Zoom told it: ""Currently, it is not possible to enable E2E encryption for Zoom video meetings."" This means Zoom can access the video and audio of meetings, it reported. Because Zoom uses email domains to identify users who may be in the same company, the service will sometimes allow small internet service providers' customers to see each others' private data, reported Vice's tech website Motherboard. The company told Motherboard that it regularly updates a  list of private email providers to avoid this. Zoom hasalso been criticised for its ""attendee tracking"" feature,external, which, when enabled, lets the host of the Zoom call check if participants are clicking away from the main Zoom window during a call. More recently, the UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson last week tweeted a picture of himself chairing a Cabinet meeting using Zoom, leading to questions about how secure it was. Allow Twitter content?

Sainsburyâs uses âloopholeâ to keep Argos open,"Sainsbury's has been accused of exploiting a loophole to keep Argos outlets open during the UK lockdown. Under government restrictions, all non-essential shops have been closed for the past week. As supermarkets are an exception, Argos concessions within Sainsbury's shops remain open. But workers fear health risks and customers said they should be shut. Sainsbury's said people can only buy items at the in-store Argos outlets if they have already paid for them online. ""Like many other online retailers, we are selling essential products for the millions of people now living and working entirely from home,"" a Sainsbury's spokesperson told the BBC. ""This includes products for the home office, for educating and entertaining children and for adults to stay fit and entertained at home. ""We are then strongly advising customers to have these delivered to their homes. We also have an option to collect from Sainsbury's supermarkets while doing an essential food shop."" The government has publisheda list of which essential shops,externalcan remain open during the pandemic, but it has not imposed any restrictions on which products can be sold within those stores. But many stores have taken action. Health and beauty chain Boots, for example, has kept its stores open for pharmaceutical goods, but has closed its in-store beauty and fragrance counters. Marks & Spencer has kept its food halls open to customers, but closed down its clothing and home operations after the government said non-essential shops must close. Off-licences added to list of 'essential' shops Easter egg crackdown over essential status 'wrong' James Daunt says books are essential Book chain Waterstones has also closed its 280 shops across the UK, but has kept its warehouse open to service online deliveries. Chief executive James Daunt said books were an important resource for people who were self isolating and also to help with people's mental wellbeing. ""This doesn't seem unimportant. ""I realise many other retailers say they are essential. I think we can so with more credibility than most,"" he toldRadio 4's Today Programme. The government has issued a list of which ""essential"" retailers are allowed to stay open. They include: Supermarkets and other food shops Pharmacies Petrol stations Newsagents Bicycle shops Home and hardware stores Laundrettes and dry cleaners Garages Pet shops Post Offices Banks Businesses are still able to take online orders and deliver items to people's homes. One unnamed worker, quoted in evidence published by the House of Commons business select committee, said: ""Argos is currently using the loophole of having stores in a supermarket [Sainsbury's] to continue to trade as normal, despite virtually everything being sold being non-essential in the current crisis. ""Paddling pool, play sand, wardrobes, TVs, video games and console, all non-essential. As the standalone stores are closed, this is driving huge numbers of people to gather in their stores, to the point where people are queuing across the whole Sainsbury's. ""They are actively encouraging, on their website, people to go and buy these non-essential items in these stores. ""They are also forcing all Argos workers from their closed standalone stores, to go and work in the stores that are still trading, or a local Sainsbury's, rather than allowing them to stay at home (where the government says they should be). ""If they refuse, they are being sent home without pay and refused furlough. These actions are surely going to undermine the government's plans to contain this pandemic, leading to the deaths of hundreds, if not thousands of vulnerable people."" Another Argos employee tweeted: ""Argos is making us standalone store workers go to Argos in Sainsbury's stores which are still open or work in the delivery hub or we DON'T GET PAID. ""For me this means public transport, further increasing my risk."" Another employee, Beau Wood, tweeted: ""People are travelling all over to pick up Nintendo Switch consoles and trampolines, most are not picking up ESSENTIALS in Sainsbury's either, just using Argos, enticing people out when they should be at home.""

Hospitals urged to use lab space to test NHS staff,"Hospitals should use spare laboratory space to test self-isolating NHS staff in England for coronavirus, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said. The government faces growing criticism over a lack of testing for frontline staff who could return to work if found clear of the virus. On Tuesday, Cabinet Office ministerMichael Gove admitted the UK had to go ""further, faster"" to increase testing. It came as a13-year-old boy from south London with coronavirus died. Ismail Mohamed Abdulwahab, from Brixton in south London, is thought to be the youngest reported victim of the disease in the UK. His family, who said they were ""beyond devastated"" by his death, said Ismail had no apparent underlying health conditions and tested positive for Covid-19 on Friday, a day after he was admitted to hospital. It has also been confirmed that a ""healthy"" 19-year-old with coronavirusdied shortly after arriving at North Middlesex Hospital on 24 March. The latest daily death toll in the UK rose sharply to 381, taking the overall number of deaths to 1,789, as of 17:00 BST on Monday. Mr Gove described the rise as ""deeply shocking"", adding that ""now is absolutely not the time for people to imagine there can be any relaxation or slackening"" of lockdown measures. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash Testing so far has focussed on patients, though NHS England has told hospitals to use up to 15% of their testing capability on staff, if this is possible. Mr Hancock has now urged hospitals to go further and test as many staff as they can, with health officials saying laboratories have the capacity to take on more tests. The government has been repeatedly criticised for having said in recent weeks that testing was a priority, but then not implementing it for frontline NHS workers. Ministers have announced plans to work with the private sector and universities to scale up testing. But Mr Gove said at the press briefing that the ability to increase testing capacity was being hampered by the availability of the chemicals needed to test patients. There is much confusion over the issue of testing and a multitude of figures flying around. That reflects uncertainty at the highest levels of Whitehall on what is really going on. It's a critical issue for the NHS: Doctors and nurses who are self-isolating need to be tested, so that if they do not have the virus, they can quickly return to work, at a time when staff are badly needed on the frontline. The government target is to get to 25,000 people being tested each day - a goal which has now been shifted back until late April. An earlier target set at 10,000 should have been hit by now. The daily testing total is still at about 8,000. Then, there's laboratory capacity, which, according to officials, should allow 12,500 tests to be analysed each day and 15,000 by the end of this week. So why is that capacity not being used? That remains a bit of a mystery. If it can be solved then many more NHS staff could be tested. A global shortage of chemical supplies has been blamed by Michael Gove. But the full answer is probably more complex. Testing kits are hard to find in some areas. There is likely to be inefficiency in the organisation of testing processes and laboratory analysis. When the pandemic is over, many questions will be asked about whether the UK did order enough kit and supplies early enough. Right now, ministers and officials have an immediate problem to fix. Chris Hopson, the chief executive of NHS Providers, said if existing NHS pathology labs had unlimited swabs and reagent, there would be enough test machine capacity to process around 100,000 tests a day. But Mr Hopson said a ""reagent and swab shortage is currently limiting this to [around] 13,000 a day"". The government hopes to be able to process 15,000 tests for NHS staff in the coming days, according to Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick. Kuenssberg: Lack of testing becomes political problem Is the NHS ready for the surge in coronavirus cases? The Chemical Industries Association acknowledged demand was ""escalating"" but said reagents - used to find out if a reaction occurs - were being manufactured and delivered to the NHS. And shadow international trade minister Bill Esterson told the BBC: ""I asked the chemical industry [on Tuesday] and they said to me their member companies aren't aware of any shortage."" Mr Gove said Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Mr Hancock - who are both self-isolating after testing positive for Covid-19 - were working with companies worldwide to get the materials needed. Staff at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff are among those carrying out a diagnostic test for coronavirus Speaking at the government's daily coronavirus briefing, Mr Gove said: ""More NHS staff are returning to the front line, and more testing is taking place to help those self-isolating come back, and to protect those working so hard in our hospitals and in social care. ""But while the rate of testing is increasing, we must go further, faster."" A fifth of nurses have been affected, the Royal College of Nursing said, while the British Medical Association said staff began being tested over the weekend, but only in low numbers. BMA chairman Dr Chaand Nagpaul said: ""It's been well over two weeks since the government said it was going to roll out priority testing for healthcare staff. ""But many doctors still have no idea about where or how they can get tested."" Is the UK testing enough people? How to understand the coronavirus death toll Conservative former Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said it was ""very worrying"" that the government had not introduced mass testing. He said it had been the key to finally controlling the outbreak in Wuhan, the Chinese city where the disease first appeared. ""It is internationally proven as the most effective way of breaking the chain of transmission,"" Mr Hunt said. Professor David Heymann, a former chair of Public Health England, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the government was implementing community studies to determine hotspots of infections in Britain. ""I happen to know that there are studies being planned by Public Health England and by others around the UK to determine what the actual extent of transmission has been,"" he said.

Two thousand NHS staff tested for coronavirus,"NHS workers have been tested at a drive-through site at an Ikea store in Wembley, north London The government is facing growing pressure to ramp up coronavirus testing, as the UK saw its biggest daily increase in deaths. Some 2,352 virus patients had died in hospital as of 17:00 on Tuesday - up 563 in a day,the latest figures show,external. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said testing was ""massively increasing"" and it was ""the way through"" the pandemic. Meanwhile a major international climate meeting,COP26, is the latest event to be postponed as a result of the virus. The climate talks were due to take place at Glasgow's Scottish Events Campus in November - which is being turned into a temporary field hospital to treat coronavirus patients. The UN's climate body, the UNFCCC, and the UK government said the summit would be pushed back to 2021. Ina video message posted on Twitter,external, the prime minister said Wednesday had been a ""sad, sad day"" due to the high number of deaths in the UK. Mr Johnson, who is self-isolating in Downing Street after contracting the virus, also reiterated the government's commitment to ""ramp up"" testing. He said: ""This is how we will unlock the coronavirus puzzle. This is how we will defeat it in the end."" The government has been under pressure to increase the screening of medics, so that those who are self-isolating unnecessarily can return to work. More than 3,500 NHS frontline staff in England and Wales have been tested for the virus since the outbreak began. But cabinet minister Michael Gove said a shortage of chemicals needed for the tests meant the NHS - which employs 1.2m in England - could not screen all workers. The prime minister's official spokesman said the government was working with NHS England, Public Health England and other organisations to boost test capacity with an additional network of labs and testing sites. Dr Yvonne Doyle, Public Health England medical director, told a daily coronavirus briefing in Downing Street that there was currently capacity for about 3,000 tests a day for frontline NHS staff. She said the ""intention"" was for testing for frontline staff to increase from ""thousands to hundreds of thousands within the coming weeks"". The World Health Organization has said the world is set to reach one million confirmed cases and 50,000 deaths worldwide in the next few days. Dr Doyle said the UK was not in ""as severe"" a position as Spain, the US or Italy, but added there was ""no reason to be complacent"". She said while the spread of the virus was most advanced in London, the Midlands was ""obviously a concern"" too. As of 9:00 on Wednesday, 152,979 people in the UK had been tested for the virus with 29,474 confirmed positive. This includes 4,139 cases in the Midlands and 8,341 in London. Dr Doyle added while use of public transport had gone down since the government enforced social distancing measures, an ""up-tick"" in motor vehicle use in the last 24 hours was ""slightly concerning"". She urged members of the public to stay home to ""protect the NHS"". The number of questions about the lack of testing at the daily press conference came as no surprise. The government has been heavily criticised for not increasing testing capacity more quickly. Dr Doyle said she was confident the UK would achieve the target of 25,000 tests a day by the end of the month. There is some way to go - over the past 24 hours just shy of 10,000 tests have been done. The lack of tests means NHS staff have had to self-isolate at home when members of their household show symptoms. News that there are going to be five drive-through centres for staff will also help. But it was interesting Dr Doyle was also asked by how much more testing can be increased by in the long-term. If the number of cases does come down, testing will play a crucial role in allowing the lockdown to be eased. The plan would be to contain the virus by testing lots of people quickly. That will require the UK to be able to tests hundreds of thousands of people a day. A doctor who came out of retirement to volunteer for the NHS has become the fourth UK medic to die with the virus, which causes the disease Covid-19. Dr Alfa Sa'adu, 68, had been volunteeringat Queen Victoria Memorial Hospital in Welwyn when he contracted coronavirus. His son Dani Saadu posted online that his dad had died after ""fighting the virus for two weeks"". ""My dad was a living legend, worked for the NHS for nearly 40 years saving people's lives here and in Africa,"" he said. The BBC's head of statistics Robert Cuffe said the latest increases in the number of patients dying with coronavirus balance out with the below-average rises on Sunday and Monday. How to understand the coronavirus death toll He said the number of new deaths has been increasing at a slightly slower rate than earlier in the epidemic, ""but if that keeps up, we'd expect to see in the region of a thousand deaths a day by the weekend"".

The prime minister's official spokesperson said the government was working with a number of suppliers which had come forward with offers of PPE, or proposals to manufacture more.

Banks forced to axe investor payouts to fight virus,"Some of the UK's biggest banks have agreed to scrap dividend payments and hold onto the cash, which may be needed during the coronavirus crisis. The Bank of England welcomed the decision to suspend the payments to shareholders and urged the banks not to pay bonuses to senior staff either. The banks, which include NatWest, Santander and Barclays, were due to pay out billions to shareholders. But in recent days they have come under pressure to hold onto the money. The deputy governor of the Bank of England, Sam Woods, wrote to some banking bosses asking them to suspend dividend payments. He asked them to confirm their decision by Tuesday evening. In a statement, the Prudential Regulation Authority, which is part of the Bank of England, said: ""Although the decisions taken today will result in shareholders not receiving dividends, they are a sensible precautionary step given the unique role that banks need to play in supporting the wider economy through a period of economic disruption."" Between them, Lloyds, Royal Bank of Scotland, Barclays, HSBC and Standard Chartered were expected to pay a total of Â£15.6bn to shareholders, according to analysis from investment firm AJ Bell. But they will now retain those funds and not pay out any money to shareholders until at least the end of the year, which the Bank of England said ""should help the banks support the economy through 2020"". A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash Many economists are predicting that the UK, in common with other large economies, will enter a recession this year, with output set to plummet. Last week,a closely-watched early indicator of economic activity,externalfell to its lowest ever reading. That led economists at Capital Economics to predict a 15% contraction in the UK's economy during the second quarter of the year. Stephen Jones, chief executive for UK finance, the trade body for banks and finance companies, told the Today programme that banks were considering scrapping dividends before the Bank of England mandated it. ""It's very prudent for banks to be retaining capital rather than distributing it in the current environment,"" he said. Losses will increase on existing loans, he said, meaning lenders need a bigger buffer to protect deposits and keep the bank running. ""It's important that the banks are given as much firepower as they can to support the economy,"" he added. However, the Bank said it did not expect the cash to be needed, noting that the banks had more than enough money in reserve to deal with both a global recession and a shock in the financial markets. Shareholders in Barclays had been due to share Â£1bn in dividends on Friday Banks were criticised during the financial crisis 12 years ago when they paid dividends months before needing the biggest bailouts in history. Since then, banks have been forced to hold more capital to prevent the need for more public money to be spent on them, although not all banks have fully recovered.  The government still owns 62% of Royal Bank of Scotland, for example. Barclays' investors will be the first to be affected by the halting of dividends. Its shareholders had been due to share a payment of more than Â£1bn on Friday. Barclays chairman Nigel Higgins said suspending the payment was a ""difficult decision"". ""The bank has a strong capital base, but we think it is right and prudent, for the many businesses and people that we support, to take these steps now, and ensure that Barclays is well placed to continue doing what we can to help through this crisis,"" he added. UK consumers are protected up to Â£85,000 per bank under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme.  In other words, if a bank collapses, savers will get any money in these accounts up to Â£85,000 paid back in compensation. Joint accounts have a protection level of Â£170,000. This is a significant move from the commercial banks. They decided not to pay shareholders several billion pounds worth of dividends after receiving a firmly-worded letter from the Bank of England, which wants the banks to hold on to the money to support lending in the economy. And, with some of the payments due to be made in just days, the impact will be felt almost immediately by some shareholders. The Bank of England's watchdog, the Prudential Regulation Authority, also made clear that it does not expect any of the UK commercial banks to pay cash bonuses either, although that is yet to be agreed. The logic here is to preserve cash for where it is needed, but the regulator has also been making the point that this crisis is a moment of potential redemption for the sector. The banks have the opportunity to distance themselves from the financial crisis, which they created, to become the economic saviours of the coronavirus crisis. But that depends on them preserving cashflow, overdrafts and funding lines to businesses that will become viable again once the pandemic passes. For example, the chancellor's freelance worker scheme will result in substantial cash sums being deposited in bank accounts, but not until June, and much depends on banks keeping workers financially afloat until then. The cancellation of dividends also piles on the pressure for other sectors that have received money for furloughing workers - or even more direct government backing - to also consider scrapping their dividend payouts. ""These are difficult decisions, not least in terms of the immediate impact they will have on shareholders,"" said Barclays chairman Nigel Higgins. ""The bank has a strong capital base, but we think it is right and prudent, for the many businesses and people that we support, to take these steps now, and ensure that Barclays is well placed to continue doing what we can to help through this crisis.""

No sugar-coating: Trump changes tack on coronavirus,"Both President Trump (left) and Dr Fauci acknowledged the seriousness of the situation There was no sugar-coating it this time. No optimistic talk of miracle cures or Easter-time business re-openings. There was just the cold, hard reality of the facts on the ground. ""I want every American to be prepared for the hard days that lie ahead,"" a grave-faced Donald Trump said in his Tuesday afternoon press conference. ""This is going to be a very, very painful two weeks."" Trump extends US virus guidelines to end of April Trump backs away from New York 'quarantine' How painful? When the president was asked how many Americans are currently projected to die from the virus given even the current mitigation efforts, he said it was better if his medical experts responded. The number of deaths, based on current projections, is between 100,000 and 200,000. On 15 April, for instance, 2,214 Americans are expected to die. This video can not be played When asked about the scarcity of masks, Donald Trump suggests scarves as protection against Covid-19 ""No-one is denying that we're going through a very, very difficult time,"" said Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. ""That's what it is."" The president tried to frame this news as best he could, noting that the projections for US casualties if the government had done nothing were in the millions. ""A lot of people were saying think of it as the flu, but it's not the flu,"" he said. ""It's vicious."" Refrigeration units are being used as makeshift morgues in New York City - the worst hit place in the US Of course, it was just a week ago the president himself was making exactly such comparisons, noting that the early fatality numbers were much less than those from the flu or even automobile accidents. ""We lose thousands of people a year to the flu,"" he said then. ""We never turn the country off."" Three out of four Americans under some form of lockdown What this crisis reveals about US and Trump Now, however, the seriousness of the situation has hit home. He spoke of checking in on a friend who was in the hospital with the virus -  ""a little older, and he's heavy, but he's tough person"" - only to find out he was now in a coma. ""I spoke to some of my friends, and they can't believe what they're seeing,"" he said. This video can not be played US death rates v UK, Italy and South Korea Mr Trump's change of attitude also extended to some of his recent political feuds. Just days after attacking Democratic Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, mocking her name and calling her incompetent on Twitter, the president said he had a ""really great conversation"" with her and detailed the support the federal government was providing her state. Last Friday, he had suggested that if state leaders were not ""appreciative"" of him, he wouldn't talk to them. On Tuesday, he recounted conversations with Democratic governors in California and Louisiana. There was still a veiled shot at New York and its Democratic governor Andrew Cuomo, however, as the president suggested that both his state and New Jersey - the two hardest hit in the US - ""got off to a very late start"" with their pandemic response. Trump also pushed back against Cuomo's complaint earlier on Tuesday that states were being forced to bid against each other, and the federal government, on the ventilator market. ""They shouldn't be doing that,"" the president said. ""If that happens, they should be calling us. If they need them that badly, we know."" ""Some people frankly think they need them but they don't need them,"" he added. The new call from the White House was to continue the current mitigation efforts for an additional 30 days; that even if things go from bad to worse in the weeks to come, the efforts will pay off. It will, however, be a long, slow grind. ""There's no magic bullet,"" said Dr Deborah Birx, one of the experts on the US taskforce. ""There's no magic vaccine or therapy. Just behaviours,"" she said.

Kelly Iles, from The Barn Kitchen in Coventry, has used food from her closed venue, while more than 700 people have also paid for meals for doctors and nurses via a link on her website. ""I've wiped out my entire business stock but I don't care,"" she said. ""I've accepted that I no longer own a restaurant. ""I don't know if I will come back out of this.But hey, so what, it's just bricks.""

Russell FullerBBC tennis correspondent Wimbledon has been cancelled for the first time since World War Two because of the coronavirus pandemic. The tournament was due to be played between 29 June and 12 July. The entire grass court season has been abandoned, and there will be no professional tennis anywhere in the world until at least 13 July. Sowhere does that leave the sport for the rest of the year? Design and technology teachers at a school are producing protective face masks to be used by NHS staff. The masks will be worn by GPs and frontline staff going into homes where patients have tested positive for Covid-19. Each teacher at the independent Bryanston School, near Blandford, Dorset, is using a 3D printer at home to produce between 100-200 component parts, prior to final assembly of the masks. Christopher Mills, head of design & technology, said: ""We are pleased to be able to put our skills and equipment to good use."" Masks can help stop the spread of coronavirus, but only if they are used inthe right circumstances.  Signs have been put up tocreate a one-way system for pedestriansaround a village to avoid people getting too close during the pandemic. Bruce Eggeling, a parish councillor in Lower Heyford, Oxfordshire, put up the signs after noticing there were narrow spots on two routes around the village. People are being urged to stay two metres apart to help avoid spreading the virus. The signs ask people to walk in an anti-clockwise direction on a short loop and clockwise on a longer loop. BBC 1Xtra's DJ Ace says he's fully recovered after testing positive for coronavirus. The presenter ison the waiting list for a new kidney- meaning he's at a higher risk of getting severe symptoms from the virus. In an Instagram post he reassured people with underlying health problems that getting Covid-19 doesn't always mean ""the worst case scenario"". But he said it was important to ""do everything [experts] tell you to do"".  Chronic kidney disease ison the listof conditions considered ""higher risk"" by the government. Higher risk people are being ""strongly advised"" to followsocial distancing rules.  Rob StevensBBC News The British Boxing Board of Control ""may have to consider""running Covid-19 tests on fightersas part of medicals when boxing returns to action. The move would affect about 1,200 licensed boxers and it could also include trainers and cornermen. On Monday, boxing's governing body suspended all events until the end of May because of the coronavirus outbreak. Eighty members of the armed forceshave been drafted in to drive response vehicles and take calls for South Central Ambulance Service(SCAS). The service covers Berkshire, Buckinghamshire, Hampshire, Oxfordshire, Sussex and Surrey. SCAS said the extra support would help provide 20 to 30 more ambulances a day. It's to cope with an expected increase in demand due to the coronavirus outbreak. Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online A loss of smell or taste may be a sign that you have coronavirus, according to UK researchers. A team at King's College London looked at responses from more than 400,000 people reporting suspected Covid-19 symptoms to an app. But loss of smell and taste are also signs of other respiratory infections, such as the common cold. And experts say fever and cough remain the most important symptoms of the virus tolook out for and act upon. Rob EnglandBBC News London firefighters will help with ""a number of ambulance service roles"" in response to the coronavirus pandemic,the service has said,external. A brigade spokesman said up to 300 staff could drive ambulances and assist paramedics. It follows an agreement between nation fire service bodies to support local authorities and the NHS. Chief executive of London Ambulance Service, Garrett Emmerson, said the offer came as ""we and the rest of the NHS are facing the biggest public health challenge in our history."" ""As part of our preparations we must reach out to all our partners to help boost our response so we can continue to treat every patient who needs us during this difficult time."" Firefighters must have specific qualifications to be able to take on the new duties, including first aid care and use of defibrillators. Stephan ShemiltBBC Sport The coronavirus lockdown has hit the UK just as fans and players of all levels of cricket were gearing up for a new season. Across the globe, there has been no major action in any form of the game since 16 March, the longest gap between matches in 37 years. With so many questions about this summer, I've been looking at what problems could arise, possible solutions, andwhat is happening elsewhere in the cricketing world. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics Thelatest figures show 563 patients with coronavirus have died in a day, taking the total number of deaths in UK hospitals to 2,352. But the increases in the number of patients dying balances out with the below-average rises on Sunday and Monday. ""On average, over the last week, the number of new deaths has been growing just below a quarter every day - or doubling twice in a week. ""That's slightly slower than earlier in the epidemic but if that keeps up, we'd expect to see in the region of a thousand deaths a day by the weekend.""

For now, here are Wednesday's headlines: Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter A day after the White House coronavirus task force presented a dire outlook for the coming weeks that included more than 100,000 projected US deaths, Donald Trump shifted focus. Instead of leading with the latest efforts to control the spread of the disease, the president had his military officials talk about drug interdiction in Latin America. Eventually the subject did turn to the virus, with Trump once again warning that the days ahead would be âhorrificâ. He said he would not issue a nationwide stay-at-home order, however, because âstates are differentâ. Nor would he restrict airline flights out of âhotspotâ cities like New York, Detroit and New Orleans at this time. He also once again declined a chance to criticise the Chinese government for the spread of the virus â a marked change from past weeks. Trump had previously made a point to call the coronavirus the âChinese virusâ at every opportunity â even writing it in by hand in his briefing notes. Now he downplayed Chinaâs role as the source of the disease and suggested he had no opinion on allegations that China was underreporting its coronavirus deaths. âIâm not an accountant from China,â he said. Instead, he emphasised the recent Chinese trade deal and described his relationship with Chinese President Xi Jinping as âvery goodâ. While many of the presidentâs conservative supporters hold China responsible for the global pandemic, assigning blame no longer seems to be part of the presidentâs strategy. US President Donald Trump is accompanied by members of his national security team ""He was a little on the short side for the NBA,"" says Mr Trump about his top immunologist Dr Anthony Fauci, after reporters ask if he's been given a security detail due to his time in the public spotlight. Dr Fauci refuses to respond, and Mr Trump jumps in to say that everybody loves him. Mr Trump then tells a story he says he once heard about Dr Fauci winning an ""unwinnable"" basketball game. Dr Fauci is now giving an update on efforts to identify a vaccine to the coronavirus. He says US researchers are ""right on target"" to have a vaccine in the next year and a half. Mr Trump suggests that he may seek to curtail domestic flights, which in some cases, he says, are flying from ""hot spot to hot spot"". But, he says, if you do that ""youâre really clamping down on an industry"" that is desperate, as fewer and fewer people are travelling. ""Thatâs a calculation weâre looking at right now,"" he says. Mr Trump said that his ""older"" and ""heavier"" friend is not doing well after being infected with coronavirus. He says it was the ""severity"" of the virus and how infectious it was that led him to stop equating it to seasonal flu. ""It is so contagious. Nobody has seen anything like this,"" he says, adding: ""The flu is not anything like that."" ""Also the violence of it. if it hits the right person that person's in deep trouble,"" he says, adding that his own friend ""is in deep trouble"". Mr Trump continues, saying ""difficult days are ahead for our nation"". ""Weâre going to have a couple of weeks starting pretty much now that are going to be horrific. ""But even in the most challenging of times Americans do not despair, we do not give into fear. ""We persevere, we overcome and we win."" If you share one bit of advice with 20 of your friends and they then do the same, it only takes five times for that to happen for more than 3m people to see the message. That is how quickly information - and therefore misinformation - can spread. We all want to help our friends and families by passing on advice that can support them at this time - but if it turns out to be false it could end up doing more harm than good.

The USS Theodore Roosevelt pictured in 2018 Reporters are now asking military officials about the 4,000 US Navy sailors whose ship, the USS Theodore Roosevelt, is facing a coronavirus outbreak that has already sickened scores of US sailors. Defense Secretary Mark Esper says he rejects the ""narrative out there that we should shut down entire US military"" to contain the spread. ""Thatâs not feasible. We have a mission, to protect United States and our people. So we live and work in cramped quarters,"" such as tanks, submarines and aircraft carriers. It's the ""nature of our business"", he adds. Guam has agreed to quarantine the sailors in hotels around the Pacific island US territory after the captain issued an urgent appeal for help. Read more here: Crew of US aircraft carrier to be quarantined in Guam President Donald Trump says that soon the US will have more ventilators than it needs, despite the claims by healthcare workers across the country that they are desperately lacking ventilators and other medical equipment. ""We're going to be distributing the extras around the world,"" Mr Trump says, specifically mentioning Italy, China and Spain. Earlier today, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo warned that only about 20% of people who are put on ventilators there are surviving Covid-19. Today's White House briefing has not featured updates from Drs Fauci or Birx, who have become the public faces of the administration's efforts to contain the virus. Instead the illegal narcotics trade has been the focus. ""For a long time we've had lots of drugs coming into our country,"" says Mr Trump. ""We want to see if we can stop a good percentage of the drugs coming into our country,"" Mr Trump says, arguing that the people who smuggle the drugs - who could be infected with Covid-19 - will also be kept from entering.

Nurse in Washington state While the White House daily briefing continues, here's a look at the policy decisions taken by President Trump's administration so far. Medical supply shortages, slow to test and mixed messaging are among the shortcomings in the US response,writes the BBC's Anthony Zurcher. The focus of the White House briefing on Covid-19 continues to be the illegal drugs trade. US Defense Secretary Mark Esper tells reporters that ""many criminal organisations are attempting to capitalise on this crisis"". The US military, he says, will ""keep the pressure on these criminal groups and protect Americans from the devastation caused"" by the illegal drug trade. ""You're not going to kill additional Americans,"" warns General Mark Milley. ""In this difficult time, I know that every American will do their patriotic duty and help us achieve this total victory,"" begins Mr Trump. He is joined at the podium by Attorney General Bill Barr, and members of the military. Mr Trump says that drug cartels are taking advantage of the pandemic to expand their network into the United States. He adds that the US Southern Command will double anti-drug efforts, in an effort to protect the health of all Americans. Cleaners wipe down the White House podium before the briefing The daily White House coronavirus briefing is due to begin very shortly. Yesterday Donald Trump said the next two weeks were going to be ""very, very painful"". In the past few hours, Mississippi and Georgia have issued stay-at-home orders, after the nearby state of Florida took the same action earlier today. The Republican governors of both states had been reluctant to issue mandatory orders, as had the Florida governor, who was facing massive pressure to shut down the state amid a growing death toll. On Wednesday, Florida's Ron DeSantis spoke directly to President Trump before issuing his decision. A majority of US states are now on lockdown, with over 75% of the US population told to stay at home. Meanwhile US country music superstar Dolly Parton has pledged $1m to Vanderbilt University, in her home state of Tennessee, to support research into a cure for Covid-19. On Twitter, Parton said she hoped to inspire ""people that can afford it to make donations"" as well. Starting on Thursday, the nine-time Grammy award winner will also begin reading children's stories in a new Facebook video series calledGoodnight with Dolly,external. The daily news briefing from the White House is due to get under way shortly. We'll let you know as soon as it begins. President Donald Trump and his Covid-19 task force will discuss the latest efforts to contain the outbreak - and the latest predictions. The US death toll has surpassed 4,000 and fears grow that as many as 240,000 people could die from the disease, even with the mitigation measures in place. New York is the hardest hit state in the nation. The UK will call up 3,000 military reservists as part of its response to the coronavirus outbreak. Their duties will include ""providing additional medical and logistical support for the NHS, acting as liaison officers and deploying specialist skills such as engineering and accounting"", the Ministry of Defencesaid on its website.,external They will be deployed for six months initially, and no-one already working for the NHS or delivering essential services will be mobilised to ensure they can continue in their roles, the ministry added. Armed Forces Minister James Heappey said: ""I know our reservists will answer the nation's call with real enthusiasm and will play a key part in our response to Covid-19."" Drive-through testing takes place at the former site of the Michigan state fairgrounds in Detroit Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan has said the city will be the first to use the new 15-minute coronavirus test kits recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The tests were sent on Wednesday by Abbott Laboratories, a Chicago-based company, and are being deployed immediately. Mr Duggan also said there were now 2,483 cases in Detroit and the death toll stood at 82. The city is also moving to test all emergency responders after 91 Detroit Police Department employees and 17 firefighters tested positive. Sales of alcohol have reportedly spiked in the US, where almost three out of four people are now under some form of lockdown. Online sales of alcoholic drinks more than tripled last week (up 243% compared to the same time period the year before), according to market research firm Nielsen. Shops sales also rose by 55% the research suggested - with tequila and gin named as the most popular tipples. In the UK, some online wine merchants had been forced to suspend orders ""due to unprecedented demand"" after pubs and clubs were told to close. But British off-licences have been told they can stay open - after being added to the list of essential businesses. It came as some British supermarketsplaced a limit on the amount of alcohol productsshoppers can buy at one time after their supplies kept running dry. Meanwhile, in South Africa, thesale of alcohol has been banned. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."

Design and technology teachers at a school are producing protective face masks to be used by NHS staff. The masks will be worn by GPs and frontline staff going into homes where patients have tested positive for Covid-19. Each teacher at the independent Bryanston School, near Blandford, Dorset, is using a 3D printer at home to produce between 100-200 component parts, prior to final assembly of the masks. Christopher Mills, head of design & technology, said: ""We are pleased to be able to put our skills and equipment to good use."" Masks can help stop the spread of coronavirus, but only if they are used inthe right circumstances.  Signs have been put up tocreate a one-way system for pedestriansaround a village to avoid people getting too close during the pandemic. Bruce Eggeling, a parish councillor in Lower Heyford, Oxfordshire, put up the signs after noticing there were narrow spots on two routes around the village. People are being urged to stay two metres apart to help avoid spreading the virus. The signs ask people to walk in an anti-clockwise direction on a short loop and clockwise on a longer loop. BBC 1Xtra's DJ Ace says he's fully recovered after testing positive for coronavirus. The presenter ison the waiting list for a new kidney- meaning he's at a higher risk of getting severe symptoms from the virus. In an Instagram post he reassured people with underlying health problems that getting Covid-19 doesn't always mean ""the worst case scenario"". But he said it was important to ""do everything [experts] tell you to do"".  Chronic kidney disease ison the listof conditions considered ""higher risk"" by the government.

Rob StevensBBC News The British Boxing Board of Control ""may have to consider""running Covid-19 tests on fightersas part of medicals when boxing returns to action. The move would affect about 1,200 licensed boxers and it could also include trainers and cornermen. On Monday, boxing's governing body suspended all events until the end of May because of the coronavirus outbreak. Eighty members of the armed forceshave been drafted in to drive response vehicles and take calls for South Central Ambulance Service(SCAS). The service covers Berkshire, Buckinghamshire, Hampshire, Oxfordshire, Sussex and Surrey. SCAS said the extra support would help provide 20 to 30 more ambulances a day. It's to cope with an expected increase in demand due to the coronavirus outbreak. Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online A loss of smell or taste may be a sign that you have coronavirus, according to UK researchers. A team at King's College London looked at responses from more than 400,000 people reporting suspected Covid-19 symptoms to an app. But loss of smell and taste are also signs of other respiratory infections, such as the common cold. And experts say fever and cough remain the most important symptoms of the virus tolook out for and act upon. Rob EnglandBBC News London firefighters will help with ""a number of ambulance service roles"" in response to the coronavirus pandemic,the service has said,external. A brigade spokesman said up to 300 staff could drive ambulances and assist paramedics. It follows an agreement between nation fire service bodies to support local authorities and the NHS. Chief executive of London Ambulance Service, Garrett Emmerson, said the offer came as ""we and the rest of the NHS are facing the biggest public health challenge in our history."" ""As part of our preparations we must reach out to all our partners to help boost our response so we can continue to treat every patient who needs us during this difficult time."" Firefighters must have specific qualifications to be able to take on the new duties, including first aid care and use of defibrillators. Stephan ShemiltBBC Sport The coronavirus lockdown has hit the UK just as fans and players of all levels of cricket were gearing up for a new season.

With so many questions about this summer, I've been looking at what problems could arise, possible solutions, andwhat is happening elsewhere in the cricketing world. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics Thelatest figures show 563 patients with coronavirus have died in a day, taking the total number of deaths in UK hospitals to 2,352. But the increases in the number of patients dying balances out with the below-average rises on Sunday and Monday. ""On average, over the last week, the number of new deaths has been growing just below a quarter every day - or doubling twice in a week.

A former taxi driver with a ""heart of gold"" died after contracting coronavirus, his friend has said. Graham Bright, 76, who ran a taxi business in Ebbw Vale died
in hospital on Friday night, Kevin Windross said. He said Mr Bright collapsed on 21 March and was taken to Nevill Hall Hospital in Abergavenny where a test confirmed he had Covid-19. Mr Windross, who worked for Brighties Taxis for 13 years, added.âHe was a well-known figure in Ebbw Vale and had a heart
of gold. ""In normal times the taxi drivers of Ebbw Vale would follow to the funeral, but that canât happen,â Mr Windross's ex-wife Lisa Sidoni said his death had come as a ""complete
shock"" and she had helped to re-home his
much-loved black Labrador called Buster. Three inmates at Swansea prison have tested positive for coronavirus, a union leader has said. Mark Fairhurst, of the Prison Officersâ Association (POA), said the inmates who tested positive for Covid-19 were being kept in their cells, in line with government advice. Other prisoners are also being tested, he added. New measures have been rolled out to deal with potential outbreaks within prisons in response to the pandemic, including closing off gyms and libraries, and stopping all visits. Meanwhile pregnant women who do not pose a high risk of harm to the public are to be temporarily released from prison, the UK government has announced. Mothers in special units with young babies will also be released, subject to a risk assessment, under the move which applies in England and Wales. A GP surgery has apologised after sending a letter asking patients with life-limiting illnesses to complete a ""do not resuscitate"" form. A letter, which appears to be from Llynfi surgery, in Maesteg, asks people to complete the form to ensure emergency services would not be called if their condition deteriorates due to coronavirus. The letter says in an âideal situationâ doctors would have had this conversation in person but had written to them due to fears they are carrying the virus and were asymptomatic. âWe will not abandon you,â it said. âBut we need to be frank and realistic."" According to the Guardian newspaper, the letter was sent to a small number of patients and the staff at the surgery were apologising directly to those who had received it. Allow Twitter content?

Banks bow to pressure and axe shareholder payments,"Some of the UK's biggest banks have agreed to scrap dividend payments and hold onto the cash, which may be needed during the coronavirus crisis. The Bank of England welcomed the decision to suspend the payments to shareholders and urged the banks not to pay bonuses to senior staff either. The banks, which include NatWest, Santander and Barclays, were due to pay out billions to shareholders. But in recent days they have come under pressure to hold onto the money. The deputy governor of the Bank of England, Sam Woods, wrote to some banking bosses asking them to suspend dividend payments. He asked them to confirm their decision by Tuesday evening. In a statement, the Prudential Regulation Authority, which is part of the Bank of England, said: ""Although the decisions taken today will result in shareholders not receiving dividends, they are a sensible precautionary step given the unique role that banks need to play in supporting the wider economy through a period of economic disruption."" Between them, Lloyds, Royal Bank of Scotland, Barclays, HSBC and Standard Chartered were expected to pay a total of Â£15.6bn to shareholders, according to analysis from investment firm AJ Bell. But they will now retain those funds and not pay out any money to shareholders until at least the end of the year, which the Bank of England said ""should help the banks support the economy through 2020"". A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash Many economists are predicting that the UK, in common with other large economies, will enter a recession this year, with output set to plummet. Last week,a closely-watched early indicator of economic activity,externalfell to its lowest ever reading. That led economists at Capital Economics to predict a 15% contraction in the UK's economy during the second quarter of the year. Stephen Jones, chief executive for UK finance, the trade body for banks and finance companies, told the Today programme that banks were considering scrapping dividends before the Bank of England mandated it. ""It's very prudent for banks to be retaining capital rather than distributing it in the current environment,"" he said. Losses will increase on existing loans, he said, meaning lenders need a bigger buffer to protect deposits and keep the bank running. ""It's important that the banks are given as much firepower as they can to support the economy,"" he added. However, the Bank said it did not expect the cash to be needed, noting that the banks had more than enough money in reserve to deal with both a global recession and a shock in the financial markets. Shareholders in Barclays had been due to share Â£1bn in dividends on Friday Banks were criticised during the financial crisis 12 years ago when they paid dividends months before needing the biggest bailouts in history. Since then, banks have been forced to hold more capital to prevent the need for more public money to be spent on them, although not all banks have fully recovered.  The government still owns 62% of Royal Bank of Scotland, for example. Barclays' investors will be the first to be affected by the halting of dividends. Its shareholders had been due to share a payment of more than Â£1bn on Friday. Barclays chairman Nigel Higgins said suspending the payment was a ""difficult decision"". ""The bank has a strong capital base, but we think it is right and prudent, for the many businesses and people that we support, to take these steps now, and ensure that Barclays is well placed to continue doing what we can to help through this crisis,"" he added. UK consumers are protected up to Â£85,000 per bank under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme.  In other words, if a bank collapses, savers will get any money in these accounts up to Â£85,000 paid back in compensation. Joint accounts have a protection level of Â£170,000. This is a significant move from the commercial banks. They decided not to pay shareholders several billion pounds worth of dividends after receiving a firmly-worded letter from the Bank of England, which wants the banks to hold on to the money to support lending in the economy. And, with some of the payments due to be made in just days, the impact will be felt almost immediately by some shareholders. The Bank of England's watchdog, the Prudential Regulation Authority, also made clear that it does not expect any of the UK commercial banks to pay cash bonuses either, although that is yet to be agreed. The logic here is to preserve cash for where it is needed, but the regulator has also been making the point that this crisis is a moment of potential redemption for the sector. The banks have the opportunity to distance themselves from the financial crisis, which they created, to become the economic saviours of the coronavirus crisis. But that depends on them preserving cashflow, overdrafts and funding lines to businesses that will become viable again once the pandemic passes. For example, the chancellor's freelance worker scheme will result in substantial cash sums being deposited in bank accounts, but not until June, and much depends on banks keeping workers financially afloat until then. The cancellation of dividends also piles on the pressure for other sectors that have received money for furloughing workers - or even more direct government backing - to also consider scrapping their dividend payouts. ""These are difficult decisions, not least in terms of the immediate impact they will have on shareholders,"" said Barclays chairman Nigel Higgins. ""The bank has a strong capital base, but we think it is right and prudent, for the many businesses and people that we support, to take these steps now, and ensure that Barclays is well placed to continue doing what we can to help through this crisis.""

UK must go 'further' on testing,"This video can not be played Michael Gove: The first of thousands of new ventilators will be delivered to the NHS next week The UK must go ""further, faster"" to ramp up its testing capacity for coronavirus, Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove has said. The government has set a target of carrying out 25,000 tests a day - but that will not be met until the end of April. Mr Gove said there was a global shortage of the chemicals needed to test patients. More than 8,000 patients were tested on Monday. Speaking at the government's daily coronavirus briefing, Mr Gove said: ""More NHS staff are returning to the front line, and more testing is taking place to help those self-isolating come back, and to protect those working so hard in our hospitals and in social care. ""But while the rate of testing is increasing, we must go further, faster."" He added that a ""critical constraint"" on the ability to increase testing capacity was the availability of the chemicals needed to test patients. ""We are working with companies worldwide to ensure that we get the material we need to increase tests of all kinds,"" he said. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash His comments come amid mounting criticism about the inability of some health staff to get tests. The Royal College of Physicians has said as many as a quarter of doctors are off work because they are having to self-isolate - either because they are showing symptoms or a member of their household is. A fifth of nurses have been affected, the Royal College of Nursing said, while the British Medical Association said staff began being tested over the weekend, but only in low numbers. How to understand the coronavirus death toll Is the NHS ready for the surge in coronavirus cases? BMA chairman Dr Chaand Nagpaul said: ""It's been well over two weeks since the government said it was going to roll out priority testing for healthcare staff. ""But many doctors still have no idea about where or how they can get tested."" Meanwhile, an A&E nurse who did not want to be named told the BBC: ""Staff are not being tested, and protective clothing is limited. ""It does feel unnerving. Our team is very strong at work and our matron has said no staff are to go near patients if we don't have the protective clothing. ""The protective clothing comes in daily but we are going through it so fast that it becomes limited by the end of the day."" Later in the briefing, Mr Gove said the UK was working to secure more ventilators, including buying them from EU nations and placing orders at home. The first ""of thousands"" of new ventilator devices would roll off the production line this weekend and be delivered to the NHS next week, he said. It comes asthe biggest daily increasein the number of people who have died with coronavirus in the UK - 381 - was reported. As of 17:00 BST on Monday, the total number of UK deaths linked to the virus was 1,789. But NHS England medical director Prof Stephen Powis said there were still some ""green shoots"". He said there was a ""bit of a plateau"" in the number of new cases, despite the total rising to more than 25,000 cases overall. Earlier in the epidemic the number of cases was doubling every three days, but the rate of increase is lower than that now. These are largely just the cases diagnosed in hospital as people with mild illnesses in the community are not being tested. But Prof Powis added: ""It's really important not to read too much into this. ""It's early days, we're not out of the woods, we're very much in the woods. ""The number of infections is not rising as rapidly as it once was. ""So green shoots, but only green shoots and we must not be complacent and we must not take our foot off the pedal."" He also said there was still ""headroom"" in the NHS to treat patients despite the rising number of cases. A drive-in coronavirus test centre for NHS workers has opened at Ikea's Wembley store, in north-west London Some 10,767 people are currently in hospital in England, but Prof Powis said even in London, which has seen the most cases at 3,915, there were still beds free thanks to the increase in intensive care capacity. The number of beds have been doubled to 1,400 with more due to open later this week when NHS Nightingale - the field hospital at the Excel Centre in east London - starts accepting patients. Elsewhere in England, the Midlands is also starting to see a rising number of admissions with 1,918 currently in hospital, Prof Powis said. Mr Gove described the sharp rise in the latest reported UK deaths linked to coronavirus as ""deeply shocking"" but he could not say exactly when the peak of the epidemic would come. ""There's not a fixed date like Easter when you know that the peak will come, it depends on the actions of all of us,"" he said. He added that ""now is absolutely not the time for people to imagine there can be any relaxation or slackening"" of lockdown measures.

We can't believe what happened,"" he told BBC Radio Sussex. ""It really is saddening. The whole lane is in shock really."" Ch Supt Westerman said it was a ""a very, very difficult situation to have to deal with, particularly when children are involved"". Police family liaison officers had been deployed to support the family, while detectives carry out house-to-house enquiries, speak to witnesses and carry out forensic investigations, he said.

"UK must go 'further, faster' on virus testingThe government is working to increase coronavirus tests, Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove says.","This video can not be played Michael Gove: The first of thousands of new ventilators will be delivered to the NHS next week The UK must go ""further, faster"" to ramp up its testing capacity for coronavirus, Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove has said. The government has set a target of carrying out 25,000 tests a day - but that will not be met until the end of April. Mr Gove said there was a global shortage of the chemicals needed to test patients. More than 8,000 patients were tested on Monday. Speaking at the government's daily coronavirus briefing, Mr Gove said: ""More NHS staff are returning to the front line, and more testing is taking place to help those self-isolating come back, and to protect those working so hard in our hospitals and in social care. ""But while the rate of testing is increasing, we must go further, faster."" He added that a ""critical constraint"" on the ability to increase testing capacity was the availability of the chemicals needed to test patients. ""We are working with companies worldwide to ensure that we get the material we need to increase tests of all kinds,"" he said. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash His comments come amid mounting criticism about the inability of some health staff to get tests. The Royal College of Physicians has said as many as a quarter of doctors are off work because they are having to self-isolate - either because they are showing symptoms or a member of their household is. A fifth of nurses have been affected, the Royal College of Nursing said, while the British Medical Association said staff began being tested over the weekend, but only in low numbers. How to understand the coronavirus death toll Is the NHS ready for the surge in coronavirus cases? BMA chairman Dr Chaand Nagpaul said: ""It's been well over two weeks since the government said it was going to roll out priority testing for healthcare staff. ""But many doctors still have no idea about where or how they can get tested."" Meanwhile, an A&E nurse who did not want to be named told the BBC: ""Staff are not being tested, and protective clothing is limited. ""It does feel unnerving. Our team is very strong at work and our matron has said no staff are to go near patients if we don't have the protective clothing. ""The protective clothing comes in daily but we are going through it so fast that it becomes limited by the end of the day."" Later in the briefing, Mr Gove said the UK was working to secure more ventilators, including buying them from EU nations and placing orders at home. The first ""of thousands"" of new ventilator devices would roll off the production line this weekend and be delivered to the NHS next week, he said.
