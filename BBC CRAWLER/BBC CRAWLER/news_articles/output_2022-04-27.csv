War to cause 'worst price shock in 50 years',"Ukraine is a major exporters of crops such as sunflower oil but the war has reduced supplies The war in Ukraine is set to cause the ""largest commodity shock"" since the 1970s, the World Bank has warned. In a new forecast, it said disruption caused by the conflict would contribute to huge price rises for goods ranging from natural gas to wheat and cotton. The increase in prices ""is starting to have very large economic and humanitarian effects"", Peter Nagle, a co-author of the report, told the BBC. He said ""households across the world are feeling the cost of living crisis"". ""We're particularly worried about the poorest households since they spend a larger share of income on food and energy, so they're particularly vulnerable to this price spike,"" the senior economist at the World Bank added. Shoppers could face Â£271 rise in annual food bills Supermarkets set limits on sale of cooking oil Full embargo on oil could stop war - ex-Putin aide Energy prices are set to increase more than 50%, pushing up bills for households and businesses, the World Bank says. The biggest rise will be in the price of natural gas in Europe, which is set to more than double in cost. Prices are forecast to fall next year and in 2024, but even then will remain 15% higher than they were last year. The World Bank said this means that from the lows of April 2020 until the highs of March this year we have seen ""the largest 23-month increase in energy prices since the 1973 oil price hike"", whentensions in the Middle Eastsent prices soaring. Energy prices are soaring because of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and set to remain high into 2024 Similarly oil prices are expected to remain elevated into 2024 with a barrel of the benchmark measure, Brent Crude, projected to average $100 this year, something which will lead to widespread inflation. Russia produces about 11% of the world's oil, the third biggest share, but the report said ""disruptions resulting from the war are expected to having a lasting negative effect"" as sanctions mean that foreign companies leave and access to technology is reduced. Russia currently provides 40% of the EU's gas and 27% of its oil, but European governments are moving towean their countries off of supplies from Russia. That has helped push up global prices by creating more demand for supplies from elsewhere. The World Bank commodity outlook also warned many foods are set to see steep rises in their costs. The UN food prices index already shows they are at theirhighest since records began60 years ago. Wheat is forecast to increase 42.7% and reach new record highs in dollar terms. Other notable increases will be 33.3% for barley, 20% for soybeans and 29.8% for oils and 41.8% for chicken. These increases reflect the fact that exports from Ukraine and Russia have fallen drastically. Before the war the two countries accounted for 28.9% of global wheat exports according to JP Morgan, and 60% of global sunflower supplies - a key ingredient in many processed foods - according to S&P Global. The rising cost of food has contributed to protests against the government in Sri Lanka Prices for other raw materials including fertilisers, metals and minerals are also predicted to go up. The costs of timber, tea and rice are amongst the few expected to fall. ""Wheat is one of the hardest agriculture exports to replace,"" according to a research note from the Bank of America. It points out that poor weather conditions in North America and China are likely to exacerbate the impact of Ukrainian supplies being reduced, something which will continue because the war has disrupted the spring planting season. The note also suggests grain and oilseed shipments from Ukraine have fallen more than 80% because of the fighting and these lost exports, over the course of a year, ""equate to about 10 days of world food supply"". This video can not be played Watch: Ros Atkins on why the war in Ukraine is pushing up food prices - and the likely impact on poorer countries The chief executive of Archer Daniels Midland, one of the world's four big food commodity traders, said he does not expect prices to come down soon. As the US firm announced a 53% increase in net earnings for the first three month of this year, to $1.05bn, Juan Luciano said: ""We expect reduced crop supplies - caused by the weak Canadian canola crop, the short South American crops, and now the disruptions in the Black Sea region - to drive continued tightness in global grain markets for the next few years"". KitKat maker Nestle warns of further price rises Five ways the Ukraine war could push up prices Ukraine war 'catastrophic for global food' The World Bank's Peter Nagle says rising food prices are having ""very large economic and humanitarian effects"" Mr Nagle, from the World Bank, said other countries can help solve the supply shortage caused by Ukraine's war in the medium term. However a forecast 69% increase in fertiliser prices this year means ""there's a real risk that as farmers start to use fewer fertilisers, agricultural yields will decline"". For commodities overall, the World Bank report said: ""While prices generally are expected to peak in 2022, they are to remain much higher than previously forecast."" It added that ""the outlook for commodity markets depends heavily on the duration of the war in Ukraine"" and the disruption it causes to supply chains.

How much does Europe rely on Russia for gas?,"Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, many countries have pledged to end or restrict their oil and gas imports to curtail Moscow's revenues and hinder its war effort. The Russian economy is highly dependent on its energy sector, and Europe is a major importer of Russian energy, making cutting back difficult. EU nations haveended imports of Russian oil brought in by sea, and a ban on refined oil products will come in from 5 February. The United States said last March it would stop importing Russian oil, and the UK said it was banning Russian crude oil and refined productswith effect from 5 December,external. European countries have sought to reduce their dependence on Russian gas An oil price capapproved by Western allies in Decemberalso aims to prevent Russia getting more than $60 (Â£48) for a barrel of crude oil. Russia's gas sector has also been targeted. The EU said in March it wouldcut gas imports from Russia by two-thirds within a year. The UK, which only imported small quantities of Russian gas, it has now ended this altogether. Urals oil is currently being exported from Russia's north western sea port of Primorsk for around $40 per barrel, from where it has largely gone to European destinations. The value of Russian oil from other ports and pipelines varies, but the Urals price has fallen across the board since the EU banned imports of Russian oil by sea. The price cap on Russian oil was agreed by the world's major economies at the same time. But energy analyst Ben McWilliams believes it is the EU oil embargo impacting the price, rather than the price cap. ""Russian oil is being traded at around $50 (Â£40) per barrel. That has been driven by the embargo because Russia now has to try to sell elsewhere."" Moscow is losing out on about $175m (Â£140m) a day from fossil fuel exports due to these measures, according toa study by the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA).,external India is taking advantage of cheaper oil imported from Russia Major Russian banks have also been removed from the international financial messaging system Swift. Countries continuing to trade with Russia have sought ways around this. Both China and India are increasingly making their oil and gas purchases in their local currencies. India, China and Turkey all ramped up their purchases of Russian oil last year - and together they now make up 70% of all Russian crude flows by sea. And Russia was offering its oil at a significantly lower price than the global benchmark Brent crude. At the start of 2022, Russia supplied less than 2% of India's oil imports, but it is now on course to become its largest single supplier. China's imports of Russian oil have fluctuated, but have also risen over the past year. In 2021,more than half of all Russia's crude oil exports,externalwent to countries in Europe. But in 2022, UK imports of oil from Russia fell sharply and other European countries have cut back too. But some have remained heavily reliant, such as the Slovak Republic and Hungary. European countries have been looking to see if they can source supplies elsewhere. The International Energy Agency (IEA) club of oil importing countries agreed to release 120m barrels of crude from their stocks in 2022. The US also released some of its strategic reserves last year. But calls for oil-rich nations such as Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Venezuela to increase production have not been successful. Opec and other major oil producerscut production in late 2022 to sustain prices. Reducing gas imports from Russia has been a major challenge for many European countries, as the continent has been getting most of its gas through pipelines linked to Russia. In 2021, Russia was supplying EU countries with 40% of their natural gas, with Germany the largest importer, followed by Italy and the Netherlands. That had dropped to around 17% by August 2022,according to EU figures.,external In 2021, the UK got just 4% of its gas supply from Russian. It now imports none. EU states areincreasingly looking to ship in liquefied natural gas,external(LNG) in tankers from producers such as the US and Qatar. Your device may not support this visualisation The shift towards LNG imports by European countries has been very significant, replacing supplies from Russia. However, ""there aren't enough LNG terminals in Europe"", says energy advisor Kate Dourian. ""This will be a problem for Germany, particularly."" There are several new LNG terminals planned and some already under construction across Europe as countries try to boost their capacity. Clarification 21 October: A previous version of this story contained a graphic with the title: 'The UK has much less gas storage than some other European countries'. The aim was to show how much gas the UK had in storage at that time. It was not intended to show the UK's total capacity for gas storage. How can the world cope without Russian oil and gas?

Should we be worried about a gas supply crisis?,"Russian energy giant Gazprom says it has halted gas exports to Poland and Bulgaria over the countries' refusal to pay for supplies in roubles - but how worried should we be? Both Poland and Bulgaria were already planning not to renew their contracts with Gazprom, which expire at the end of the year. In Poland's case, it had been filling its stores of gas ahead of time, which provides some cushion, especially as we approach the summer lull in use of gas. This escalation is real, and justified by the Kremlin on the basis of a refusal to pay for gas by changing money into roubles in Russian bank accounts. But the additional impact of today's news should be containable. Gas prices in the UK are well down on their record peaks of Â£5 per therm last month, at about Â£1.70. UK terminals have been flooded with liquefied natural gas (LNG) - over 100 tanker-loads so far this year - with the largest amount coming from the US. But it can't be stored here, and much is being re-exported to the European Union (EU). Indeed, market contacts suggest that the export pipeline of gas from the UK to continental Europe is currently at the limits of its capacity. These UK prices are still consistent with further rises in gas bills in October - perhaps of a few hundred pounds a year. Could the world cope without Russian oil and gas? Germany rules out immediate ban on Russian oil All that would change, of course, if these moves today are the first skirmishes in an escalating European energy crisis that could see Germany cut off from Russian gas in the next few months. That would send prices spiralling across Europe and lead to a crisis of supply. There is some helpful ambiguity in what is termed ""forcing buyers to pay for Russian gas in roubles"". ""Various governments and companies stating 'we will not pay in roubles' therefore are not providing any clarity as to whether they will use the new payment process or not, which in turn means there is ambiguity over upcoming supply to other, larger, markets,"" says Tom Marzec-Manser, head of gas analytics at market information provider ICIS. German firms are paying in euros that are then exchanged into roubles at a specific Russian bank. This arrangement allows all to continue the mutual gas trade dependence, but it is a precarious balance. German ministers say that they are not afraid of paying the economic price to eliminate the ""strategic mistake"" of energy dependence on the Kremlin, but that they just cannot do it any time soon. So the actions of the Kremlin through Gazprom need to be put in perspective. It has cut off some supplies as a result of refusal to change the terms of payment, but notably this was to two countries which had already said their contracts with Gazprom would be allowed to expire this year. As the conflict continues, and Germany ups the ante in terms of supplies of weapons to Ukraine, the real question is about the flow of gas from Russia to Germany, which continued uninterrupted even during the height of the Cold War. This move is designed as a Kremlin shot across the bows of Europe's biggest economies. While Germany, for example, has said it is willing to phase out Russian coal in the summer, and hinted Russian oil could follow over the next year, gas is another matter. Last week, Germany's finance minister told me it would be physically impossible to immediately phase out the 45% dependence of Germany on Russia for its gas. Russia gas supply cuts 'blackmail', says EU Russia halts gas exports to Poland and Bulgaria How are sanctions affecting Russia's energy exports?

Sunak: Silly to give more support on bills now,"Rishi Sunak said he would ""see where we are"" come the price cap rise in October Chancellor Rishi Sunak has said it would be ""silly"" to provide more support to tackle rising energy bills now, before knowing what will happen to prices in the autumn. Households faced a 54% hike in energy costs this month, along with record-high inflation hitting their pockets. Opposition parties have called for an emergency budget from the government to focus on the cost-of-living crisis. But Mr Sunak said he wanted to see what happened with energy prices first. He pledged the government would look again at more support in the autumn, when the price cap - whichrose by 54% in April- is expected to go up again. Labour's shadow economic secretary to the Treasury, Tulip Siddiq, said the remark showed how ""out of touch"" the chancellor was, as people were ""already feeling the cost of living crisis"". Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson Christine Jardine called Mr Sunak's comments ""tone deaf in the middle of a cost of living emergency"". Childcare and MOTs considered for cost of living help 'You're sitting here and can't afford to do things' Prices rising at their fastest rate for 30 years The cap is the maximum price suppliers in England, Wales and Scotland can charge households for energy, and it is reviewed every six months. Energy prices have been rising worldwide, driven by squeeze on natural gas supplies made worse by the war in Ukraine. The chancellor made the remarksduring a Q&A session with online forum Mumsnet,external. During the 25-minute interview, he was asked whether he would consider introducing a windfall tax on energy companies that have profited from the rise in global prices. He said the measure was ""something I would look at"" if those companies failed to make ""investments in our country and in our energy security"". ""What I don't want to do is discourage investment in our own energy supplies, because we want to improve our energy security so we're not reliant on importing lots of things from abroad,"" he said. Mr Sunak was also asked by one disabled user - who relies on life-saving equipment at home - whether the government would offer more support to cover energy bills. He responded by listing policies the government had already announced for households, including the Â£150 council tax rebate to go towards bills, and said it amounted to Â£9bn. He said: ""Now I know people are anxious about this and wondering if they are going to go up even more, and I have always been clear from the beginning we will see what happens. ""And depending on what happens to bills then, of course, if we need to act and provide support for people, we will. ""But it would be silly to do that now or last month or the month before when we don't know exactly what the situation in the autumn will be,"" the chancellor added. ""So I'd say we'll see where we are with that if we need to do more."" But Labour's Ms Siddiq said it was ""time to act"", adding: ""Families are already feeling the cost of living crisis, hit by record rises in energy prices, record high petrol prices and staggeringly steep hikes in the cost of food and essentials. ""With the chancellor heaping them with the biggest tax burden in 70 years on top of that, people are paying more and getting less."" Mr Sunak's remarks come a day after ministers gathered to pitch ideas on how to tackle the cost of living without spending any additional taxpayers' money. During the cabinet meeting in No 10, Boris Johnson is said to have proposed reducing childcare costs by easing the rules governing how many children one adult can look after. And sources said Transport Secretary Grant Shapps suggested relaxing the frequency of MOTs. But Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey said the meeting showed the PM was ""completely out of ideas during the most profound crisis in decades"". Sir Ed echoed Labour and the SNP's call for an emergency budget, including a cut in VAT, and backed opposition plans for a windfall tax on the profits of the oil and gas companies. The interview was carried out shortly before Mr Sunak was cleared by the prime minister's independent ethics adviser of breaching the ministerial code over his family's financial interests. Lord Geidt investigated whether he followed the rules and declared any potential conflicts of interest, after it emerged his wife had held non-dom tax status and he had held a US green card. The adviser found all the interests above were declared by the Chancellor in 2018 and all - with the exception of his US green card - were re-declared at later dates.

"Push Russia out of whole of Ukraine, says Truss","This video can not be played Watch: UK Foreign Secretary says victory for Ukraine is a ""strategic imperative"" for the West Russian forces must be pushed out of ""the whole of Ukraine"", the Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has said. In a keynote speech in London, Ms Truss said victory for Ukraine was now a ""strategic imperative"" for the West. This amounts to the clearest statement yet of Britain's war aims which have, until now, been limited to stating that President Putin's invasion of Ukraine ""must fail and be seen to fail"". She said Western allies must ""double down"" in their support for Ukraine. ""We will keep going further and faster,"" Ms Truss said, ""to push Russia out of the whole of Ukraine."" This implies that Russian forces must leave not just the territory occupied in recent weeks since their invasion on 24 February but also those areas they invaded and annexed eight years ago, such as Crimea in the south and parts of the eastern Donbas region. A month into this latest invasion, Russia declared its main goal was the ""liberation of Donbas"" - broadly referring to Ukraine's regions of Luhansk and Donetsk. More than a third of this area was already seized by Russian proxy forces in a war that began in 2014. Not all western powers may share Ms Truss' ambitious target, fearing it is unlikely to be achieved either by arms or negotiation. Some French and German officials have been more cautious about stating war aims that risk provoking Russia, preferring to focus instead on language about defending Ukraine. The foreign secretary's latest remarks in a speech at Mansion House in London reflect the desire by some in the West to aim high, so that Ukraine enters any possible future talks about a political settlement to the conflict with the best negotiating hand possible. Ms Truss also used her speech to make clear the West should do more to deter future Russian aggression. This, she said, should include more spending on defending itself, with the Nato target of spending 2% of national output on defence seen as ""a floor not a ceiling"". She also said Western powers should use their ""economic heft"" to exclude Russia from western markets. ""Access to the global economy must depend on playing by the rules,"" she said. But Labour's shadow foreign secretary, David Lammy, said earlier on Wednesday that the speech ""appears to be an admission of failure after more than a decade of decline"" in the government's commitment to defence and security. What is Nato and how is it helping Ukraine? The West is united for now - but what if it splits? Russia accuses UK of provoking attacks on its soil Ms Truss also set out her view that the West should send weapons to other countries threatened by Russia. ""We must ensure that, alongside Ukraine, the Western Balkans and countries like Moldova and Georgia have the resilience and the capabilities to maintain their sovereignty and freedom."" She added that if Sweden or Finland chose to join Nato, ""we must integrate them as soon as possible"". She said: ""The war in Ukraine is our war - it is everyone's warâ¦ because Ukraine's victory is a strategic imperative for all of us. ""Heavy weapons, tanks, aeroplanes - digging deep into our inventories, ramping up production. We need to do all of this."" ""We cannot be complacent - the fate of Ukraine remains in the balance. And let's be clear - if Putin succeeds there will be untold further misery across Europe and terrible consequences across the globe. Russia's president Vladimir Putin warned earlier on Wednesday that any country meddling in Ukraine would be met with a ""lightning"" fast response. ""We have all the tools [to respond] that no one can boast of,"" he told Russian lawmakers. ""And we will not be bragging about them, we will use them if necessary.""

"Tories investigate claims MP watched porn in CommonsTory chief whip is ""looking into"" claims an MP watched porn on his phone next to a female colleague.UK Politics","This video can not be played Caroline Lucas asks Boris Johnson if  sexual harassment is âgrounds for dismissalâ An independent investigation could be launched into claims a Tory MP watched porn on his phone while in the Commons.

Daily Facebook users up again after decline,"Facebook stopped losing users as 2022 got under way, even as its owner reported its slowest revenue growth in a decade. The number of daily active Facebook users grew to 1.96 billion in the first three months of the year, parent company Meta reported on Wednesday. That marked a turnaround from last year, when the social network reported a decline in users for the first time. The drop wiped billions from the firm's market value. Since executives disclosed the fall in February, the firm's share price has nearly halved. But shares jumped 19% in after-hours trade on Wednesday. ""More people use our services today than ever before, and I'm proud of how our products are serving people around the world,"" said Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg, who founded Facebook in 2004. But Meta - which also owns Instagram and WhatsApp - still reported its slowest revenue growth in at least a decade. Facebook owner Meta sees biggest ever market loss Facebook sees daily users fall for first time ever Revenues in the first three months of the year were up just 7% compared to 2021, hitting $27.9bn. Analysts say businesses are pulling back on advertising as they grapple with rising costs and economic uncertainty, stemming in part from the war in Ukraine. And while Google and Facebook have long been the go-to sites for online ad dollars, they are facing more competition as newer platforms such as TikTok draw users and online shopping giant Amazon gets into the business. Google-owner Alphabet earlier this week said advertising revenue in the first three months of the year rose 22%, more slowly than analysts had expected, while the smaller Snap also warned of troubles. Mr Zuckerberg said the firm was investing in its video ""Reels"" to compete with TikTok, and expected ad sales to catch up. But Meta is also grappling with new privacy rules from Apple, which make it more difficult to target adverts. The company has said the changes could cost it $10bn in lost sales this year. The company said it expected revenue in the coming months of $28bn to $30bn - below analyst estimates. Meta said this reflected factors including the war in Ukraine and the potential impact of regulatory changes in Europe. In March Russia banned access to Facebook and Instagram, as part of its crackdown on independent media following the invasion of Ukraine. Mr Zuckerberg has said that the firm will invest heavily in artificial intelligence and virtual reality - the so-called Metaverse - for its next phase of growth. But that is costing it dearly for now. Overall, Meta's profits in the quarter were $7.46bn - more than analysts had expected but still down 20% year-on-year. ""Meta's ad business continues to face some very real challenges,"" said Jasmine Enberg, principal analyst at Insider Intelligence. ""Facebook, of course, is no stranger to obstacles, but the [Apple] changes are the first direct threat to its ad business. ""Combined with the rise of TikTok, brand safety concerns, and a shift in social media user behaviour, there's a perfect storm heading straight for Meta's ad revenues. Even so, it's clear that advertisers are still turning to Facebook and Instagram to reach their wide audiences.""

Two big second legs await in Spain next week. Thanks for joining us tonight. We'll be back again tomorrow with two more European semi-finals featuring English sides and a big Premier League game too. Night all. FT: Liverpool 2-0 Villarreal Villarreal boss Unai Emery talking to BT Sport:""We can't tell nothing about the victory because they deserve it. The first half was defensively good but we didn't achieve in attack. ""They had two or three chances to score. The second half was the same and they pushed and deserved to score. 2-0 is a good difference for them, for us not a good result but we will try to dream and do something different in our home. The match next week will be very different than tonight. It is very important in our home to change something, maybe tactically. They are going to suffer more than tonight."" FT: Liverpool 2-0 Villarreal Liverpool Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp, speaking to BT Sport:""It was a brilliant game. First half I liked a lot. We didn't score, that is the only problem actually. But we kept them quiet, which is important because of the attacking threat that they are. We tried to create, tried to be direct, mix it up, all these kind of things, play through the lines, over the lines. We had a lot of good moments, no goals, true. In the second half we finished the situations off in a superb way. Both goals were outstanding. We wanted to score a third but from that moment on it makes sense that we control the game and that is what we did. ""In football it is always the same. You show the respect to the opponent in the way that you defend them. That is what we did and I liked it a lot. The counter-press was outstanding. The boys were really in the game from the first to the last second and that is why we won. It is only half-time but it is better than before the game. ""Maybe for the second leg, Gerard Moreno will be back, maybe one more. This is not all and is not a problem, we knew this before that we had two legs. If it is 0-0 tonight we go there anyway so it is all fine."" FT: Liverpool 2-0 Villarreal A team has progressed to the final after a 2-0 away defeat in the first leg of a European semi-final on seven occasions, including twice in the Champions Cup/Champions League: HSV against Real Madrid in 1979-80 (won 5-1 in the second leg) and Roma versus Dundee United in 1983-84 (won 3-0 in the second leg). Liverpool progressed from all eight European knockout ties they recorded a 2-0 home victory in the first leg. FT: Liverpool 2-0 Villarreal On a more positive note, Liverpool have won the first leg of a Champions League knockout stage tie for the 15th time; they
have gone on to progress in each of the previous 13 instances since being
eliminated by Bayer 04 Leverkusen in 2001-02 (1-0 W in the first leg, 4-2 L in the
second leg). FT: Liverpool 2-0 Villarreal Look, I don't want to worry any Liverpool fans, but the Reds have conceded at least three goals in the away leg of each of their last three Champions League semi-final ties: 2007-08 â Chelsea 3-2 Liverpool (after extra time) 2017-18 â Roma 4-2 Liverpool 2018-19 â Barcelona 3-0 Liverpool #bbcfootball Saidmadrid:patience paid off for Liverpool in the end..it took time to break that stubborn Villarreal defence, but the reds found the way...powerful performance Richard Dominy:You feel Liverpool really needed that third goal to give some promise of a result in the return leg.  As it is could be a tight match FT: Liverpool 2-0 Villarreal Liverpool Liverpool midfielder Thiago:""We have to recognise that we are playing a semi-final of the Champions League against a tough team like Villarreal and have to have the space to be ourselves, that's the key. ""I really enjoyed the team performance, that for me is the best thing, because we put our level as high as possible and we delivered today."" On second leg:""It will be hard there, I know this stadium before because of my time at Barcelona but we don't have time to think about the game there we have to think about our game at the weekend so that's all for us."" #bbcfootball or text 81111 (UK only - standard rates apply) Harder to win the FA cup than champions league given standard of foreign sides- to have a path to the final where the club hasn't been stretched once in any tie shows the massive gulf between the English sides and the other European leagues Jonathan Teams who turn up NOT to play football but to stop teams who want to deserve absolutely nothing. Villarreal are shocking just as Lyon were against West Ham. Martha FT: Liverpool 2-0 Villarreal Former England striker Michael Owen on BT Sport:""Villarreal have just got a pulse. If Liverpool nicked another one
it would have been game, set match. If Villarreal get an early goal in Spain you never know. ""This was total dominance. It's the best team Iâve ever seen in a red shirt. They swarm you. Villareal
must think 'whatâs hit us?' Itâs impossible to stop this unbelievable press. Theyâre
relentless. ""Imagine it[the quadruple]. Itâs impossible... but now youâre thinking can it
happen? The way theyâre playing, the belief, youâre thinking can it happen?"" FT: Liverpool 2-0 Villarreal Former England defender Rio Ferdinand on BT Sport:""This is the best Liverpool team Iâve ever seen. Theyâre relentless
with and without the ball. Itâs the way they press teams, the energy, effort, application,
you marvel at it. ""That [the quadruple] has got to be the aim. They are going to set themselves
the target. If they achieve it theyâre immortal, they are above anyone that has
played the game in this country. Whether they can achieve it remains to be seen.
But theyâre ticking boxes along the way at the moment."" FT: Liverpool 2-0 Villarreal Liverpool Liverpool midfielder Jordan Henderson, speaking to BT Sport:""They are a very organised team and we knew they would make it difficult. It was just important that we kept going and believe that we would eventually break them down. We did that with two good goals. ""First one was a bit lucky. Good build up but a bit lucky, in off the defender and keeper I think. But you need a bit of luck when a team plays with a low block. We got that and it lifted the crowd. Majority of the game, the counter-press was really good. It made it difficult for them. But the game is still alive and it will be tough in Villarreal."" Liverpool defender Andrew Robertson:""We had a few chances in the first half, trying to break them down. We had a bit of momentum after the first goal and the noise in here was incredible. It took us to the second one. We would have liked one more but a clean sheet and two goals, we can't argue with that. ""It is the semi-final of the Champions League. If you can't run around for 90 minutes in this kind of game, when will you. Our intensity has been high last couple of games. We have had a hectic schedule but we are enjoying it. There is still work to do but we are happy."" FT: Liverpool 2-0 Villareal Karen CarneyFormer Chelsea midfielder on BBC Radio 5 Live Complete control - controlled the whole game, from the first to last minute. There was a period of 10 minutes in the second half where they just turned it on and that's the sign of a fantastic team, they sense the moment and take it. That's why they're in the hunt for four trophies because they are experienced enough to know when to do it. No threats to Alisson whatsoever and it's a brilliant controlled performance from Liverpool. FT: Liverpool 2-0 Villarreal Well, the Villarreal fans aren't disappointed. They greet their players at the away end with a sea of twirling scarves. They are still in the tie. Just. Liverpool 2-0 Villarreal Villarreal came for a 0-0 but two goals in two second-half minutes gives Liverpool control of the tie. The Spanish side are going to need to have a completely different game plan back on home turf. Liverpool 2-0 Villarreal Giovani lo Celso floats the free-kick into the box and a Liverpool head meets it first to glance the ball away. Liverpool 2-0 Villarreal Villarreal have a late free-kick, in the Liverpool half. This well be the last attack of the game... #bbcfootball Fahim:Spanish dominance in the Champions League is at an end.... Economarkets:I know you can only beat what's in front of you, but Liverpool's whole champions League campaign this year feels more like Europa League based on their opponents. Couldn't dream of any easier run to the final Liverpool 2-0 Villarreal The 90 minutes are up. We'll have two added. Liverpool 2-0 Villarreal Giovani lo Celso does brilliantly to work his way away from three Liverpool players but before he can create anything meaningful Fabinho slides in to tackle. Â© 2025 BBC.

Could world cope without Russian energy?,"Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, many countries have pledged to end or restrict their oil and gas imports to curtail Moscow's revenues and hinder its war effort. The Russian economy is highly dependent on its energy sector, and Europe is a major importer of Russian energy, making cutting back difficult. EU nations haveended imports of Russian oil brought in by sea, and a ban on refined oil products will come in from 5 February. The United States said last March it would stop importing Russian oil, and the UK said it was banning Russian crude oil and refined productswith effect from 5 December,external. European countries have sought to reduce their dependence on Russian gas An oil price capapproved by Western allies in Decemberalso aims to prevent Russia getting more than $60 (Â£48) for a barrel of crude oil. Russia's gas sector has also been targeted. The EU said in March it wouldcut gas imports from Russia by two-thirds within a year. The UK, which only imported small quantities of Russian gas, it has now ended this altogether. Urals oil is currently being exported from Russia's north western sea port of Primorsk for around $40 per barrel, from where it has largely gone to European destinations. The value of Russian oil from other ports and pipelines varies, but the Urals price has fallen across the board since the EU banned imports of Russian oil by sea. The price cap on Russian oil was agreed by the world's major economies at the same time. But energy analyst Ben McWilliams believes it is the EU oil embargo impacting the price, rather than the price cap. ""Russian oil is being traded at around $50 (Â£40) per barrel. That has been driven by the embargo because Russia now has to try to sell elsewhere."" Moscow is losing out on about $175m (Â£140m) a day from fossil fuel exports due to these measures, according toa study by the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA).,external India is taking advantage of cheaper oil imported from Russia Major Russian banks have also been removed from the international financial messaging system Swift. Countries continuing to trade with Russia have sought ways around this. Both China and India are increasingly making their oil and gas purchases in their local currencies. India, China and Turkey all ramped up their purchases of Russian oil last year - and together they now make up 70% of all Russian crude flows by sea. And Russia was offering its oil at a significantly lower price than the global benchmark Brent crude. At the start of 2022, Russia supplied less than 2% of India's oil imports, but it is now on course to become its largest single supplier. China's imports of Russian oil have fluctuated, but have also risen over the past year. In 2021,more than half of all Russia's crude oil exports,externalwent to countries in Europe. But in 2022, UK imports of oil from Russia fell sharply and other European countries have cut back too. But some have remained heavily reliant, such as the Slovak Republic and Hungary. European countries have been looking to see if they can source supplies elsewhere. The International Energy Agency (IEA) club of oil importing countries agreed to release 120m barrels of crude from their stocks in 2022. The US also released some of its strategic reserves last year. But calls for oil-rich nations such as Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Venezuela to increase production have not been successful. Opec and other major oil producerscut production in late 2022 to sustain prices. Reducing gas imports from Russia has been a major challenge for many European countries, as the continent has been getting most of its gas through pipelines linked to Russia. In 2021, Russia was supplying EU countries with 40% of their natural gas, with Germany the largest importer, followed by Italy and the Netherlands. That had dropped to around 17% by August 2022,according to EU figures.,external In 2021, the UK got just 4% of its gas supply from Russian. It now imports none. EU states areincreasingly looking to ship in liquefied natural gas,external(LNG) in tankers from producers such as the US and Qatar. Your device may not support this visualisation The shift towards LNG imports by European countries has been very significant, replacing supplies from Russia. However, ""there aren't enough LNG terminals in Europe"", says energy advisor Kate Dourian. ""This will be a problem for Germany, particularly."" There are several new LNG terminals planned and some already under construction across Europe as countries try to boost their capacity. Clarification 21 October: A previous version of this story contained a graphic with the title: 'The UK has much less gas storage than some other European countries'. The aim was to show how much gas the UK had in storage at that time. It was not intended to show the UK's total capacity for gas storage. How can the world cope without Russian oil and gas?

Westwood accused of sexual misconduct,"Tim Westwood in 2021 DJ Tim Westwood is facing multiple allegations of sexual misconduct by women who say he abused his position in the music industry to exploit them. The 64-year-old is accused of predatory and unwanted sexual behaviour and touching, in incidents between 1992 and 2017. The BBC and the Guardian have heard detailed accounts from seven women in a joint investigation into the former BBC Radio 1 DJ. He strenuously denies the allegations. The DJ was an early champion of hip-hop in the UK and hosted the first nationally-broadcast rap show on UK radio from 1994. The seven women who spoke to the BBC are all black, and say they met Westwood through his work. Some of them accuse the DJ of abusing his power within the music industry. The women tell their stories in aBBC Three documentary, Tim Westwood: Abuse of Power, which airs on BBC Three at 21:00 on Tuesday. Two of them, who were aspiring to work in the industry, say they agreed to come to London to meet him to discuss music. They accuse the DJ of driving them to a flat and initiating unwanted and unexpected sex. One was 19 at the time, while Westwood was 53. Another woman told the BBC she met Westwood, then in his mid-30s, when she was 17 and a member of a R&B group. She says she was subjected to unwanted oral sex after agreeing to meet him. Four further young women accuse the DJ of either touching their bottoms or breasts as they posed for photographs with him at different events where he was performing. The women, whose names have been changed to protect their identities, do not know each other. Some work in the music industry and fear repercussions - with the DJ continuing to have a prominent role in an industry long-criticised for its treatment of darker-skinned black women. Allegations about Westwood's behaviour toward young black women have circulated on social media for some time. In 2020, Westwood issued a statement to the Mail Online hitting out at the ""fabricated allegations"" and said they were false and without foundation. Now, for the first time, following our investigation, women detail their experiences. Warning: Some of the content in their stories may be distressing. When Isabel discovered Tim Westwood was DJing at her local nightclub, she spotted a chance to have her music heard by someone influential. She was 19, and had already been getting studio time - featuring on rappers' tracks as a vocalist. Isabel was young when she realised she could sing. During her strict religious upbringing in the Midlands in the early 2000s, contemporary music was banned at home, but she spent Sundays singing gospel in church. Secretly, however, she would write her own music and dream of a future as a recording artist. By 2010, when she was a university student, she was continuing to pursue a career in music. She knew a national platform like BBC Radio 1 could take her to the next level. ""[Tim Westwood] was the main gatekeeper to get to the level of exposure I needed,"" she says. This video can not be played Isabel described what happened when Tim Westwood picked her up in his car Isabel put together a mixtape of unreleased work and included her contact details inside the CD case. Her best friend together with her stepmum went to the club night with her. They managed to hand the CD to Westwood, and Isabel says the DJ - then aged 53 - called her the next day. The two arranged to meet in London. Her family and friends shared her excitement. ""We were thinking that this is a really good lead at this point,"" she says. ""He wants to act on this quickly."" Within days, she was on a train to London for an afternoon meeting. Isabel says the plan was to meet at Nike Town on Oxford Street, near BBC Radio 1's studios. She says Westwood was there waiting in a huge American-style car. Isabel assumed they were going to talk about her music over coffee or a drink - a point she wishes she had clarified. ""I don't ask where we're going. And then at this point, we start driving,"" she recalls. But she says her discomfort grew as she realised they were heading out of central London. ""This is where I'm now like 'Oh God, where are we going, what's happening?'"" She says the conversation dried up - to the point where it was almost ""menacingly silent"". She alleges at one point on the journey, the DJ tapped her arm to get her to turn and see that he had undone his trousers and had exposed his genitals. ""I've looked and I've seen and I'm like, 'Oh, no, oh no, like, oh my God. Just don't say anything. Don't look. Don't say anything.' And I'm hoping that's enough for him to justâ¦ not."" Isabel says she felt ""completely powerless"" and ""very, very scared"". She says they eventually arrived at what she believes was Westwood's flat. She remembers it being filled with lots of records. She says she was led to a room, where she refused an offer of a drink. ""He leaves the room and then he comes back completely naked,"" she alleges. ""That's when I noticed that he has got a condom and he has removed it [from the wrapper] and started putting it on."" Isabel says she recognised the condom packet. It had the DJ's face on one side - part of a campaign Westwood did with Durex. ""I remember that very vividly because I remember that was kind of when my brain also started to shut down."" Isabel describes sitting on a chair ""frozen with fear"". She says Westwood held her shoulders and turned her around. ""I knew what was going to happen at this point. So, I'm just like 'Oh my God,' And I remember being like, hunched up and like holding on to the back of the chair, like, scared. ""He almost, like, tapped me on the back of my leg as if he wanted me to move my leg, which I didn't do. And then he sort of did."" Westwood then penetrated her. She says after he finished, she quickly got dressed and sat waiting to leave. She says the DJ seemed annoyed when she asked for a lift to the station. If you have been affected by any of these issues in this story you can visitBBC Action Line. Isabel recalls going over and over the experience on what felt like a really long journey back north. ""I just remember feeling so deflated. So sad. Feeling really ashamed of myself and bad."" She says the encounter led her to drop out from her studies and music career. Isabel's stepmum told the BBC the whole family had been excited about Isabel's chance at a breakthrough. But she knew instinctively that something had happened when Isabel got home and wouldn't talk about the meeting. But she says that after she heard Isabel's account, she felt guilty for not chaperoning her - and says she cried when Isabel disclosed that her silence was, in part, over worries her family would be disappointed with her. Like others the BBC spoke to, Isabel became aware in 2020 of allegations being made by women on social media alleging misconduct by Westwood. Pamela's story echoes Isabel's. She was just 20 when she met Westwood through friends. It was 2000 and she was working with young people who wanted to break into the music industry. She says the DJ invited her to do work experience with him at BBC Radio 1. He had joined the BBC in 1994, after making a name for himself on pirate and then commercial radio. But his show mostly focused on US artists, and Pamela says the DJ told her he wanted to understand more about the UK scene and ""get a younger audience"". She says the DJ, in his 40s at the time, reassured her ""stern Jamaican"" mother on the phone that her daughter would be OK heading to London. Pamela travelled by train from the Midlands and says Westwood picked her up in a huge American-style car. She says, as they drove, he kept stroking her leg and touching her face. She kept batting his hand away. She says he wasn't concentrating on the road and was swerving so much that a police officer on a motorbike pulled up beside them and knocked on the passenger window. Pamela says Westwood apologised - and was told to keep his eyes on the road. Pamela assumed she would be staying in a hotel as part of the work experience, but says the DJ instead drove her to an apartment where she remembers ""records and trainers and oversized clothes everywhere"". She says that at one point, he began trying to kiss her neck and remove her clothing. ""I didn't give him any kind of come on. There was no flirtation,"" she says. ""If you are trying to actively touch me and I am pushing your hand away, that means I don't want to do anything with you. If you are trying to remove [an] item of my clothing, and I put it back on, that means I don't want it to be gone. If I'm showing you I'm uncomfortable, why would you just not stop doing it?"" She says she remembers thinking she couldn't get out of the situation. ""I'm in London alone with this man. Now, if I try and get out of this, who's to say how he's going to react. So I just submit to it."" Pamela says she went home as soon as she could. She describes the encounter as ""traumatic"" and ""disgusting"". The work experience Westwood offered didn't take place. We asked the BBC whether any monitoring of any work experience scheme took place but they did not provide an answer to this question. Pamela later spoke to a friend who works in the music industry about her experience. Pamela is critical of the BBC and other organisations for the ""celebrity status"" Westwood's position afforded him over the years - a position she believes he abused. ""I would describe it as an abuse of power becauseâ¦ who they're going to believe? This little girl from the Midlands, or this big, shiny star from London? He's on national radio, international."" Westwood fronted the UK version of the hit MTV show Pimp my Ride in 2005, and was also given a drive-time show on BBC Radio 1's sister station 1Xtra, which focused on contemporary black music. Tim Westwood on stage in 2007 at Radio 1's Big Weekend in Preston He is known for giving a platform to new artists, as well as getting some of the biggest rappers in the world onto his programmes - from Eminem to Cardi B. He eventually left the BBC in 2013 as part of scheduled changes. In a Freedom of Information (FOI) request, BBC News asked the BBC whether it had received any complaints against Westwood during his time in its employment. The corporation said it could ""neither confirm nor deny whether the BBC holds the requested information"". In a statement regarding our investigation, the BBC said ""it does not comment on individuals"", but added that presenters would be expected to comply with strict codes of conduct. In a statement released after publication of this story, the BBC said it was ""shocked to hear of these allegations"". In relation to the FOI request, it clarified it did not ""hold information that is helpful for this investigation"". One woman's story we heard goes back three decades. It was the early 1990s and Tamara had been talent-spotted by producers trying to put together a British R&B group. At that time, songs from American R&B girl groups like TLC and SWV were getting radio play and finding chart success. Tamara says she was manipulated into the situation with Tim Westwood Tamara spent her time in and out of studios recording music - as well as enjoying London's nightlife meeting other artists. One time when she'd seen him around, Westwood, who was then in his mid-30s, suggested they should meet up. She was 17 at the time and believed the meeting was to talk about her career. She says that, at the time, the DJ had ""absolute power"". He picked her up, and after stopping briefly at a radio station, he took her to a flat. According to her,  he started to take down her trousers and underwear. ""Then he began instantaneously to give me oral sex. There was no talking. There was no kind of communication about that. It was just before I knew it - that's what was happening."" Tamara says that at first she tried to push his head or his shoulders away but he just continued. ""And then I just realised that I'm in a position where it's already gone too far. I'm in a place, I'm already far from home. I wouldn't know how to get home from here. I was manipulated into that situation - I was led to believe one thing, when he had something else in mind."" Working in the same industry, she says their paths continued to cross. She says Westwood had sex with her several times over the next few years before she cut off the encounters. ""I think it was almost implied by him that OK, because we'd had the first encounter, I would be up for the next encounter and being young and not having the strength and courage to just say 'Look, no, I don't feel right about this because I don't feel right about it.' It just happened."" In 2021, Tamara watched the BBC's Music's Dirty Secrets documentary in 2021 and contacted the producers asking them to investigate the DJ. Now 64, Westwood continues to perform at nightclubs around the UK and internationally, hosts freestyle sessions and interviews on his popular YouTube channel and has a Saturday night show on Global's Capital Xtra. Tim Westwood at the Wireless Festival in London in 2019 Four further women have told the BBC about their experiences with the DJ as they posed for photos at events with him. Farah says she was introduced to Westwood in 2000 at an afterparty at Bristol Carnival. She says he put his hand down her top and ""grabbed"" her breast while they were gathered for a group photograph. ""I felt cold and I felt dirty. I felt humiliated - embarrassed that I'd done something wrong,"" she says. The BBC spoke to her friend who recalled Farah telling her years ago about the incident. Another woman, Claire, described meeting Westwood at a club in Ayia Napa, Cyprus in 2009. She recalls that he said ""lemme grab some ass"" as she and a friend posed for a photograph with him, before the DJ put his hand down the back of her denim shorts. She says she ""froze"" and felt ""very intimidated"" by the experience. A third told the BBC she was a huge fan of Westwood's BBC Radio 1Xtra show when she went to an event he was DJing at in Essex - also in 2009. Then aged 19, Loretta also describes feeling his hand snake down her back before he grabbed her bottom while they posed for a picture. ""I felt his hand go back up. And stopped at my neck. And do you know, in that moment I was kind of frozen."" Photos of Tim Westwood with some of the women (blurred) who have spoken out Nyla was in university when she met Westwood at a New Year's Day event in 2017, she told the BBC. She says he described her as the ""pengest girl in the rave"" during his DJ set and then later, while she and her friend recorded a Snapchat video with him, she says he put his hand up inside the back of her skirt. She says she was ""shocked"" and felt ""objectified"". She says the DJ managed to find her Snapchat contact and called her the next day to ask her to ""hang out"". She didn't meet up with him. The BBC has seen the Snapchat footage and the images the women say were taken during their encounters. Watch on BBC iPlayer None of the women the BBC spoke to have reported their interactions to the police. Some say they are speaking about their experiences in the hope it encourages others to come forward and leads to the DJ being ""held accountable"" for his behaviour. ""It makes it feel like that wasn't completely for nothing,"" Isabel says about coming forward. ""Like, I don't just have this trauma scar for no reason. There's a purpose for other people to not have to experience it."" Have you been affected by any of the issues raised? If you are able to talk to us please email:haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external.

LiveLivePutin warns against 'outside intervention' in Ukraine11 minutes ago,"Russia's president says any country interfering in Ukraine will be met with a ""lightning-fast"" response Vladimir Putin says Russia will use ""tools no one else can boast of having"" if anyone ""creates unacceptable threats"" The commander of Ukrainian forces besieged in Mariupol appeals to world leaders for a Dunkirk-like ""extraction"" of military and civilians Russian energy giant Gazprom says it has cut gas supplies to Poland and Bulgaria over their refusal to pay in roubles Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has meanwhile accused Russian special services of carrying out attacks in a breakaway region of Moldova UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres has arrived in Kyiv on the eve of talks with Zelensky Edited by Jude Sheerin That's it for tonight. Our live coverage of the war in Ukraine will restart on Thursday morning Kyiv time. Join our continuing updateshere now. Ukrainian refugees from Mariupol arrive in Zaporizhzhia Faisal IslamBBC Economics Editor How worried should we be about Gazprom's decision to halt gas exports to Poland and Bulgaria over the countries' refusal to pay for supplies in roubles? Both Poland and Bulgaria were already planning not to renew their contracts with the Russian energy giant, which expire at the end of the year. In Poland's case, it had been filling its stores of gas ahead of time, which provides some cushion, especially as we approach the summer lull in use of gas. This escalation is real, and justified by the Kremlin on the basis of a refusal to pay for gas by changing money into roubles in Russian bank accounts. But the additional impact of Wednesday's news should be containable and the actions of the Kremlin through Gazprom need to be put in perspective. Read Faisal's full analysis Civilians shelter in a bunker in eastern Ukraine Canada's parliament has unanimously condemned Russia's actions in Ukraine as ""genocide"". The lawmakers agreed on Wednesday that there was ""clear and ample evidence of systemic and massive war crimes against humanity"" by Russian troops. The presidents of Poland and the US have both labelled Russia's killing of civilians ""genocide"", but other world leaders - such as the president of France - have stopped short of the term. International law defines genocide as the deliberate âintent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group"". Last year, Canadian MPs also voted to condemn China's treatment of Uyghur people as genocide. Read more: Is Russia's committing genocide? Russian troops are putting pressure on Ukrainian journalists in areas under Moscow's control, according to Ukrainian human rights ombudsman Lyudmyla Denisova. Russian authorities in the Zaporizhzhya Region, in the south-east of Ukraine, were taking journalists hostage, questioning them, seizing their equipment and searching their residences, the UNIAN news agency quoted Denisova as saying. A large group of journalists was kidnapped in the port city of Berdyansk on 8 March and were made to provide the personal details of their colleagues, Denisova says. In the south-eastern city of Melitopol, Russians searched the house of Ukrainian news website editor, Svitlana Zalizetska, who had fled the city. Her father was captured and released only after the Russians gained control of the website. ""By unleashing hunts for Ukrainian journalists, the occupiers are trying to intimidate them and force them to spread the Kremlin's propaganda,"" Denisova says, adding that such actions were in breach of international humanitarian law. Here are some of the latest reports from on the ground in Ukraine. The BBC has not been able to verify the claims, which were all made by local Ukrainian officials. Also:  Kyiv's TV tower was targeted by a missile just as media companies were struck by hackers, Microsoft found Russian government hackers have carried out at least 37 cyber-attacks against Ukraine since the invasion began,Microsoft has said in a report,external. The tech giant's researchers said digital attacks on Ukraine began a year in advance of the invasion and may have laid the groundwork for military missions. It also found that hacking and military operations worked in tandem, focusing on the same targets, but Microsoft said it wasn't clear whether there was a co-ordinated plan or they were just driven by shared goals. On 1 March, the day a missile was fired at Kyiv's TV tower, media companies were hit by destructive hacks and cyber-espionage, the report found. While Russian forces laid siege to the city of Mariupol, Microsoft said Ukrainians began receiving emails from a Russian organisation pretending to be a Ukrainian resident, falsely accusing the government of ""abandoning"" its citizens. Victor Zhora, a Ukrainian cyber-security official, said he continues to see Russian hackers target telecoms companies and energy grid operators on a daily basis, Reuters reported. ""I believe that they can organise more attacks on these sectors. We shouldn't underestimate Russian hackers but we probably should not over-estimate their potential,"" he said. Katya AdlerEurope Editor For the EU itâs no longer whether, but when and how import bans on Russian oil and gas will be imposed on Moscow. EU countriesâ huge dependence on Russian energy has proved a
weakness in the current crisis. But the European Commission is having to work hard to
get all member states on board with the timing of oil sanctions. EU regulations say the decision must be unanimous. Big power
Germany is no longer opposed. Itâs just announced a reduction in Russian oil
dependency from 35% a few weeks ago to 12%. Italy prefers price caps on oil to phasing out Russian imports,
but Germany and others refuse. They say it would mean negotiating with Moscow (which the EU
says it doesnât want to do under the current circumstances) to find a mutually
agreeable price, or unilaterally paying Moscow less and risking the Russian oil
taps to the whole bloc suddenly being switched off. James LandaleDiplomatic correspondent The Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has said Russian forces must be
pushed out of ""the whole of Ukraine"", in what amounts to the clearest
statement yet of Britainâs war aims. Western powers are
turning their minds to how the war in Ukraine might end, and what they want
beyond a cessation of hostilities. In her speech in
London, Liz Truss said Russia had to be pushed out of âthe whole of Ukraineâ. That is the
clearest statement yet of Britainâs war aims and implies Russian forces must
leave not just the territory occupied in recent weeks but also those areas
invaded eight years ago, such as Crimea. Not all Western
powers may share such an ambitious target. The foreign
secretary also made clear the West should do more to deter future Russian
aggression, by spending more on defence and using its economic clout to exclude
Russia from western markets. She said the West
should beef up the defence capabilities not just of Ukraine but other
threatened countries too, such as Moldova and Georgia. If Russia were to
succeed, she said, there would be âuntold misery across Europeâ. Victory for
Ukraine was a ""strategic imperative"" for the West, she said. Read more on Truss's speech here. Vitaliy ShevchenkoBBC Monitoring A series of strategic locations in Russia have caught fire, including this fuel depot in Bryansk There have been a series of fires at strategic installations
in Russian areas bordering Ukraine recently, and while many fingers are
pointing at Ukraine, it has not confirmed its involvement. For example, this morning an arms depot in the Belgorod region
caught fire, and two days earlier, there was a fire at a fuel storage facility
in Bryansk. Before that, on 1 April, there were explosions at an oil depot in
Belgorod - whicha local official,externalblamed on an attack by two Ukrainian helicopters. This is a subject which officials in Moscow prefer to
avoid. Ukrainian attacks on Russian territory would be an embarrassment to the
Kremlin, which had been hoping to have control of Ukraine within days of
invading it in February. But Ukraine itself is evasive on whether it is behind the
incidents in Russia. Commenting on them, Ukrainian presidential adviserMykhaylo Podolyak,externalblamed them on
""various reasons"" such as ""karma"". It is clear why Ukraine would be reluctant to admit any
cross-border attacks: they would amount to a major escalation in an already
bitter conflict. Following on from a rocket attack in the Black Sea coastal city of Odesa at the weekend, loved ones and friends gathered to say farewell to a three-month-old girl, her mother and grandmother. The deaths - three generations in a single family - sparked outrage and revulsion in Ukraine. Yuriy Glodan, father and husband, had only left his flat and family to go to the shops when he heard the news of the explosion. ""All my world was destroyed"" by a Russian missile, Yuriy said. You can read more about Yuriy's devastating storyhere. We've been reporting on the situation at the Azovstal steel works in Mariupol, wherehundreds of injured soldiers and civilians are reportedly trapped insideand running out of supplies. Much of Mariupol has been destroyed, and the Azovstal plant - a maze of tunnels and workshops - is the last part of the port city not under Russian control. Taking the entire Sea of Azov port is one of Moscow's key aims. Speaking earlier to Portuguese media, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said work was continuing on a plan to evacuate hundreds of civilians from the steel plant. ""This is a very complicated operation,"" said Guterres, who has this evening arrived in Ukraine after meeting Vladimir Putin in Moscow yesterday. ""Putin agreed in principle and it was agreed that the details would be discussed in the meetings that are currently taking place,"" he said. ""This operation is particularly delicate, because we are not dealing with people who are in their homes, or in public places to be evacuated, but people who are, let's say, inside a bunker in truly dramatic conditions,"" he said. ""Our aim was to do this operation on Friday but naturally, the conditions must be in place for us to do that."" The White House spokeswoman has denounced Russia's move to cut off energy supplies to Poland and Bulgaria on Wednesday. ""Unfortunately this is the type of step, the type of almost weaponising energy supplies, that was predicted,"" Press Secretary Jen Psaki told reporters at a daily briefing. She added that the US has been in contact with the leaders of the two countries within the past 24 hours. Psaki also noted that the US has been ""working for some time now, for months, with partners around the world to diversity natural gas supplies to Europe"". She added thatthe prisoner swapearlier today with Russia was not an indication of a larger diplomatic breakthrough. The release of American Trevor Reed ""does not change our approach"" to the war in Ukraine, Psaki said. Katya AdlerEurope Editor Iâm
told by EU diplomats involved in negotiations that an EU ban on Russian oil (most likely
a phased-out one) could be introduced next week. The European Commission says
itâs consulting with the US and the G7 group of the worldâs wealthiest nations
before making an announcement. The aim is that the blocâs oil sanctions be tough
enough to hurt Vladimir Putin but not so dramatic as to send shockwaves
through the global oil market - never mind the EUâs. Brussels says itâs aware
that countries rich and poor rely on oil. It says it wants to avoid provoking
global price hikes, which could in turn also undermine international support
for Western sanctions against Russia. Vladimir Putin (L) met AntÃ³nio Guterres in Moscow on Wednesday Fresh fromhis visit to Russia to meet Vladimir Putin,the UN Secretary General AntÃ³nio Guterres has arrived in Kyiv. He's due to hold talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Thursday. Writing on Twitter, Guterres said:,external""We will continue our work to expand humanitarian support and secure the evacuation of civilians from conflict zones.

The sooner this war ends, the better - for the sake of Ukraine, Russia, and the world."" President Zelensky said Russia sees a united Europe as a target for ""political blackmail"" Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has just delivered his nightly video message to the nation, in which he addresses what he calls Russia's ""energy blackmail"" against Europe. He says cutting off gas supplies to Poland and Bulgaria shows that ""no one in Europe can hope to maintain any normal economic cooperation with Russia"". Zelensky adds: ""Russia considers not only gas, but any trade as a weapon. It is just waiting for the moment when one or another trade area can be used."" He says Russia ""sees a united Europe as a target"" and the sooner everyone in the continent agrees that they cannot depend on Russia for trade, the sooner there will be stability. The Ukrainian president also welcomed a deal with the EU to suspend duties and quotas on Ukraine's exports, saying Russia wanted to create chaos in global markets - especially for food. Ukrainian exports would help stabilise markets and support the country's economy during the crisis, he said. Here are some pictures from today that show the devastation caused by the war, on the ground across Ukraine. In Irpin, a city near Ukraine's capital Kyiv, the House of Culture was destroyed by Russian troops. Pictured below is Mykola Nahornyi, 59, at his house, which he says was destroyed by Russian shelling on 7 March. He returned today to try to recover what remains from his belongings in Kolychivka, in the Chernihiv region in the north of Ukraine. In Kyiv, people have been attending a funeral ceremony of a Ukrainian soldier. The funeral was held in a particular area reserved for soldiers at Miske Cemetery in the capital. Also in Kyiv, people have been attending a demonstration at Independence Square in support of the south-eastern city of Mariupol. The remaining Ukrainian soldiers in the city, and some civilians, are still trapped at the Azovstal steel plant. Reality Check The Russian state-owned energy company, Gazprom, hascut off supplies to Poland and Bulgaria, and says it will not resume until payments are made in roubles. It's led to accusations that President Putin is trying to hit back economically at western countries which are supporting Ukraine against the Russian invasion. In 2019, Russia accounted for41% of the EU's natural gas imports,external. If Russian gas supplies to Europe dried up, Italy and Germany would be especially vulnerableas they import the most,external. But its also a question of how much gas a country is able to store: currently Poland's gas storage is 76% full, but Bulgaria's sits at just 17%. Bulgaria says it is looking to increase the amount of gas it receives from Azerbaijan, as well as making deals with Turkey and Greece; Poland is building a new pipeline connecting it to Norway's gas fields and looking to neighbouring Lithuania for supplies. Looking more widely, Europe could turn to existing gas exporters such Qatar, Algeria or Nigeria - but there are practical obstacles to quickly expanding production. The continent could also ramp up the use of other energy sources - such as renewables - but doing so is not quick or easy. So what happens next? Read on to find out who imports what and the steps being taken to reduce dependence on Russian energy. Paul AdamsBBC Diplomatic correspondent Western officials have been briefing on the latest in the war and they say Russia has continued to build up forces in and around the Donbas and are making minor gains. ""But when they come up against genuine military objectives, they are finding it difficult to overcome the staunch Ukrainian resistance and they are suffering losses,"" an official said. Heavy rain is also hampering Russian progress. ""Russians don't like to fight in the rain,â an official said, adding that the Russians have poor tactical awareness and continue to suffer from logistical difficulties. They have the ability to operate off road, but officials say itâs surprising that they still choose not to do so. Even in places where Ukrainian forces have found themselves encircled, they have managed to resupply their forces ""for a surprising length of time"". (Mariupol being the most obvious example). Officials noted that even in places where Russia has taken ground, Ukrainian forces have shown a âremarkableâ ability to counter-attack - sometimes doing it so fast that the Russians quickly find themselves on the back foot. Ukrainian special forces, operating behind Russian lines, are exploiting the vulnerability of long supply lines, which helps to buy time for Ukraine. If you're just joining us, earlier we brought you the news that Vladimir Putin has made a fresh threat to the West, sayingany country that sets out to intervene in Ukraine will face a ""lightning-fast""military response. ""We have all the tools for this, that no one else can boast of having... we'll use them, if needed,"" he said. ""We have already taken all the decisions on this."" His latest warning comes after Western countries have ramped up support for Ukraine in the past days. Yesterday, the US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin pledged to move ""heaven and earth"" to make sure Ukraine defeats Russia. And in recent days, there has been an increasing number of pledges to increase military support to Ukraine, including Germany's announcement that it will send 50 anti-aircraft tanks, in a sharp U-turn in policy. The UK is also expected to call later for fighter jetsto be provided to Ukraine. Earlier this week, Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov also claimed the West was âpouring oil on
the fireâ by providing Ukraine with firepower - and said the conflict could lead to World War Three. Putin's warning comes as tensions were heightened further today as Russian energy provider Gazprom cut off gas supplies to Poland and Bulgaria, saying it's because the countries refused to follow Moscow's new rule to pay for gas in roubles. If you're just joining us, here are the main developments in Ukraine today: Putin warns West and Gazprom cuts gas  Other developments Â© 2025 BBC.

'The thought of running out of HRT is terrifying'A shortage of some hormone-replacement therapy has left some women struggling with menopause symptoms.Health,"A shortage of specific types of hormone-replacement therapy (HRT) has left women struggling with untreated symptoms of the menopause. Demand for prescriptions has more than doubled since 2017 - partly because of work by campaigners to extend access - but supply of some products has not kept up. Women have been telling BBC News about the impact on their lives. Yasmin Darling is experiencing more frequent migraines while searching for the oestrogen gel she normally uses Yasmin Darling's experience of the menopause was sudden and profound. Two years ago, she had two operations to reduce her risk of inherited cancer which plunged her into an early menopause. ""It's really hard to navigate medical menopause 10 years early,"" the 45-year-old says. ""When you don't have the product you need, it makes it much more difficult to navigate."" Because of Covid, Yasmin has never been seen by a specialist at a menopause clinic, so she is managing as best she can on her own. She uses a gel because patches irritate her skin - but it has not been available. Sleepless nights for women due to HRT shortage Relax law to ease HRT shortage, pharmacists say Women 'borrow menopause drugs due to shortage' Even when she contacted a large chemist supplying her local one, it had no stock. Without it, Yasmin is having increasingly frequent migraines. ""I don't drive and am a parent carer and work, so I can't drive around checking different pharmacies,"" she says. ""Ideally, I'd like to use one product which is consistently available so I don't experience hormone fluctuations."" Claire Lopez, 59, spent three weeks trying to obtain her usual HRT patches from different local chemists but they were out of stock. Without them, her body becomes ""very stiff"", leading to slipped discs and severe back pain. ""I have severe anxiety if I do not have these patches, so the total lack of coordination between GPs and pharmacists was extremely frustrating,"" Claire says. In the end, she had to arrange a private prescription through a local clinic, in the Midlands, costing Â£50. ""It seems ridiculous that we have to do this every three months,"" Claire says. When she returned to her GP to get the same patches on the NHS, Claire was offered a gel instead - but she knew it would not help. ""My body doesn't absorb HRT as gel, so it doesn't work to play around with different types,"" she says. Tiffany Watkins says running out of HRT is a frightening prospect Tiffany Watkins, 37, who lives in Suffolk, started having menopause symptoms aged 35. HRT has been a ""miracle drug"", allowing her to keep working after debilitating brain fog, hot flushes and memory loss, which began last year. And after trying four different locations, Tiffany now receives patches through her local chemist, on a repeat prescription, every three months. But the possibility her supply could end is ""a frightening prospect"" always in the back of her mind. ""Without it, I would really struggle,"" Tiffany says. ""I'd be tearful all the time, with lots of aches and pains. ""HRT is like magic. ""The thought of running out is terrifying."" Sandra Lyons, 53, a production manager at a construction company in the Midlands, says her local GP refused to prescribe HRT, because of the cost. ""He just said, 'I have to prescribe antidepressants instead. If you have hot flushes, you'll have to take herbal remedies',"" Sandra says. She eventually paid for a private consultation and is now paying for a private prescription - at about Â£19 for six months' worth of pills. Sandra says her GP refused to prescribe HRT ""I'm on patches, not the gel,"" Sandra says. ""Suddenly, my mood swings, aggression and skin issues have gone."" But some male doctors do not understand the difficulties menopausal women can face. ""Shortages are the tip of the iceberg,"" Sandra says. ""Suddenly, women realise they need support on it and doctors are only just starting to be put under pressure to prescribe it. ""The manufacturers have to provide more."" Next week, retired bus driver, Carol Jackson, 66, from West Sussex, and her husband, Chris, are due to begin a ""dream trip"" - sailing their canal boat through France and Spain to Portugal. But Carol is struggling to obtain her HRT gel in time and worries she will be left without for the whole 90-day trip. Carol says her pharmacist cannot pass on details of HRT currently in stock to her GP She says she is being passed back and forth between her GP and her chemist only to be told each new prescription she hands to the pharmacist is out of stock. ""I'll probably throw myself off the boat if I can't get it in time,"" Carol jokes. ""It's a worry because I know what life without it is like. ""It would not be pleasant and would make [the trip] so uncomfortable."" Carol has been on HRT since having a hysterectomy, more than 20 years ago. Seven years ago, a doctor took her off the medication completely - from ""high dosage to zilch"" overnight. ""I struggled for two years,"" Carols says. ""It was horrendous - passing out in the supermarket and all sorts of things. ""It was a male doctor who took me off. ""The woman doctor couldn't believe it, said he should have done it gradually and put me back on it [HRT]."" The government has said it is determined to ensure supplies of HRT can meet high demand. Minister for Women's Health Maria Caulfield said: ""There are over 70 HRT products available in the UK, most of which remain in good supply. ""However, we are aware of some issues with women being unable to access certain products. ""We will be appointing a new HRT-supply chairperson and convening an urgent meeting of suppliers to look at ways we can work together to improve supply."" Manufacturers say they are increasing production, including of hormone gel Oestrogel, which has been in particularly short supply. The British Menopause Society says women unable to find their usual treatment should consider ""equivalent alternative HRT preparations"". Have you been affected by HRT shortages?

LiveLiveChampions League semi-final: Liverpool 0-0 Villarreal - Mane heads wideFollow live text and BBC Radio 5 Live commentary as Liverpool host Villarreal in the first leg of their Champions League semi-final.,"Use play icon to watch 5 Live Final Score, or audio icon to just listen to commentary FT: Liverpool 2-0 Villarreal - Henderson cross deflected into net before Mane's second Fabinho and Robertson have goals disallowed Second leg takes place next Tuesday (3 May) Winner will face Man City or Real Madrid in final on 28 May in Paris Get involved via #bbcfootball Phil Dawkes So after the first legs of the two Champions League semi-finals it is advantage to the Premier League, with Manchester City and Liverpool leading. Two big second legs await in Spain next week. Thanks for joining us tonight. We'll be back again tomorrow with two more European semi-finals featuring English sides and a big Premier League game too. Night all. FT: Liverpool 2-0 Villarreal Villarreal boss Unai Emery talking to BT Sport:""We can't tell nothing about the victory because they deserve it. The first half was defensively good but we didn't achieve in attack. ""They had two or three chances to score. The second half was the same and they pushed and deserved to score. 2-0 is a good difference for them, for us not a good result but we will try to dream and do something different in our home. The match next week will be very different than tonight. It is very important in our home to change something, maybe tactically. They are going to suffer more than tonight."" FT: Liverpool 2-0 Villarreal Liverpool Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp, speaking to BT Sport:""It was a brilliant game. First half I liked a lot. We didn't score, that is the only problem actually. But we kept them quiet, which is important because of the attacking threat that they are. We tried to create, tried to be direct, mix it up, all these kind of things, play through the lines, over the lines. We had a lot of good moments, no goals, true. In the second half we finished the situations off in a superb way. Both goals were outstanding. We wanted to score a third but from that moment on it makes sense that we control the game and that is what we did. ""In football it is always the same. You show the respect to the opponent in the way that you defend them. That is what we did and I liked it a lot. The counter-press was outstanding. The boys were really in the game from the first to the last second and that is why we won. It is only half-time but it is better than before the game. ""Maybe for the second leg, Gerard Moreno will be back, maybe one more. This is not all and is not a problem, we knew this before that we had two legs. If it is 0-0 tonight we go there anyway so it is all fine."" FT: Liverpool 2-0 Villarreal A team has progressed to the final after a 2-0 away defeat in the first leg of a European semi-final on seven occasions, including twice in the Champions Cup/Champions League: HSV against Real Madrid in 1979-80 (won 5-1 in the second leg) and Roma versus Dundee United in 1983-84 (won 3-0 in the second leg). Liverpool progressed from all eight European knockout ties they recorded a 2-0 home victory in the first leg. FT: Liverpool 2-0 Villarreal On a more positive note, Liverpool have won the first leg of a Champions League knockout stage tie for the 15th time; they
have gone on to progress in each of the previous 13 instances since being
eliminated by Bayer 04 Leverkusen in 2001-02 (1-0 W in the first leg, 4-2 L in the
second leg). FT: Liverpool 2-0 Villarreal Look, I don't want to worry any Liverpool fans, but the Reds have conceded at least three goals in the away leg of each of their last three Champions League semi-final ties: 2007-08 â Chelsea 3-2 Liverpool (after extra time) 2017-18 â Roma 4-2 Liverpool 2018-19 â Barcelona 3-0 Liverpool #bbcfootball Saidmadrid:patience paid off for Liverpool in the end..it took time to break that stubborn Villarreal defence, but the reds found the way...powerful performance Richard Dominy:You feel Liverpool really needed that third goal to give some promise of a result in the return leg.  As it is could be a tight match FT: Liverpool 2-0 Villarreal Liverpool Liverpool midfielder Thiago:""We have to recognise that we are playing a semi-final of the Champions League against a tough team like Villarreal and have to have the space to be ourselves, that's the key. ""I really enjoyed the team performance, that for me is the best thing, because we put our level as high as possible and we delivered today."" On second leg:""It will be hard there, I know this stadium before because of my time at Barcelona but we don't have time to think about the game there we have to think about our game at the weekend so that's all for us."" #bbcfootball or text 81111 (UK only - standard rates apply) Harder to win the FA cup than champions league given standard of foreign sides- to have a path to the final where the club hasn't been stretched once in any tie shows the massive gulf between the English sides and the other European leagues Jonathan Teams who turn up NOT to play football but to stop teams who want to deserve absolutely nothing. Villarreal are shocking just as Lyon were against West Ham. Martha FT: Liverpool 2-0 Villarreal Former England striker Michael Owen on BT Sport:""Villarreal have just got a pulse. If Liverpool nicked another one
it would have been game, set match. If Villarreal get an early goal in Spain you never know. ""This was total dominance. It's the best team Iâve ever seen in a red shirt. They swarm you. Villareal
must think 'whatâs hit us?' Itâs impossible to stop this unbelievable press. Theyâre
relentless. ""Imagine it[the quadruple]. Itâs impossible... but now youâre thinking can it
happen? The way theyâre playing, the belief, youâre thinking can it happen?"" FT: Liverpool 2-0 Villarreal Former England defender Rio Ferdinand on BT Sport:""This is the best Liverpool team Iâve ever seen. Theyâre relentless
with and without the ball. Itâs the way they press teams, the energy, effort, application,
you marvel at it. ""That [the quadruple] has got to be the aim. They are going to set themselves
the target. If they achieve it theyâre immortal, they are above anyone that has
played the game in this country. Whether they can achieve it remains to be seen.
But theyâre ticking boxes along the way at the moment."" FT: Liverpool 2-0 Villarreal Liverpool Liverpool midfielder Jordan Henderson, speaking to BT Sport:""They are a very organised team and we knew they would make it difficult. It was just important that we kept going and believe that we would eventually break them down. We did that with two good goals. ""First one was a bit lucky. Good build up but a bit lucky, in off the defender and keeper I think. But you need a bit of luck when a team plays with a low block. We got that and it lifted the crowd. Majority of the game, the counter-press was really good. It made it difficult for them. But the game is still alive and it will be tough in Villarreal."" Liverpool defender Andrew Robertson:""We had a few chances in the first half, trying to break them down. We had a bit of momentum after the first goal and the noise in here was incredible. It took us to the second one. We would have liked one more but a clean sheet and two goals, we can't argue with that. ""It is the semi-final of the Champions League. If you can't run around for 90 minutes in this kind of game, when will you. Our intensity has been high last couple of games. We have had a hectic schedule but we are enjoying it. There is still work to do but we are happy."" FT: Liverpool 2-0 Villareal Karen CarneyFormer Chelsea midfielder on BBC Radio 5 Live Complete control - controlled the whole game, from the first to last minute. There was a period of 10 minutes in the second half where they just turned it on and that's the sign of a fantastic team, they sense the moment and take it. That's why they're in the hunt for four trophies because they are experienced enough to know when to do it. No threats to Alisson whatsoever and it's a brilliant controlled performance from Liverpool. FT: Liverpool 2-0 Villarreal Well, the Villarreal fans aren't disappointed. They greet their players at the away end with a sea of twirling scarves. They are still in the tie. Just. Liverpool 2-0 Villarreal Villarreal came for a 0-0 but two goals in two second-half minutes gives Liverpool control of the tie. The Spanish side are going to need to have a completely different game plan back on home turf. Liverpool 2-0 Villarreal Giovani lo Celso floats the free-kick into the box and a Liverpool head meets it first to glance the ball away. Liverpool 2-0 Villarreal Villarreal have a late free-kick, in the Liverpool half. This well be the last attack of the game... #bbcfootball Fahim:Spanish dominance in the Champions League is at an end.... Economarkets:I know you can only beat what's in front of you, but Liverpool's whole champions League campaign this year feels more like Europa League based on their opponents. Couldn't dream of any easier run to the final Liverpool 2-0 Villarreal The 90 minutes are up. We'll have two added. Liverpool 2-0 Villarreal Giovani lo Celso does brilliantly to work his way away from three Liverpool players but before he can create anything meaningful Fabinho slides in to tackle. Â© 2025 BBC.

Boeing reveals losses from Trump Air Force One deal,"Former US President Donald Trump's new deal for Air Force One was a bad one for Boeing, the plane-maker's chief executive has said. Dave Calhoun spoke as the firm said it expected to lose $1.1bn (Â£875m) on the two planes for the White House. Mr Trump had forced the company to renegotiate its contract, calling the initial deal too expensive. The new agreement made Boeing, not taxpayers, responsible for changes to costs. ""We took some risks not knowing that Covid would arrive and not knowing that inflation would take hold like it has - and both of those have impacted us fairly severely,"" Mr Calhoun said on a conference call with investors on Wednesday. Technically, ""Air Force One"" is a call sign for any aircraft carrying the US president. However the term is mostly used to refer to the current fleet - two highly customised Boeing 747-200B jets, which have been in service since 1990. Before Mr Trump was elected in 2016, the government had a roughly $4bn contract with Boeing to build two or more new planes. But in 2016, shortly after Mr Trump's victory, he tweeted that they were too expensive and called for cancelling the order. Two years later, the two sides announced a new $3.9bn dealto convert two new 747-8 planes with a communications suite each, internal and external stairs, large galleys and other equipment and modifications to protect passengers. At the time, Mr Trump - who prides himself on his deal-making - hailed the agreement, though critics said the savings weren't clear. Boeing - a major government and defence contractor - faced ""a very unique negotiation, a very unique set of risks that Boeing probably shouldn't have taken"" during the Air Force One talks, Mr Calhoun said. ""But we are where we are, and we're going to deliver great airplanes."" The planes are designed to be an airborne White House, able to fly in worst-case security scenarios, such as nuclear war, and are modified with military avionics, advanced communications and a self-defence system. The planes were supposed to be delivered by 2024 but are behind schedule, according to reports. Boeing disclosed it has lost $660m this quarter on the programme.

Our live coverage of the war in Ukraine will restart on Thursday morning Kyiv time. Join our continuing updateshere now. Ukrainian refugees from Mariupol arrive in Zaporizhzhia Faisal IslamBBC Economics Editor How worried should we be about Gazprom's decision to halt gas exports to Poland and Bulgaria over the countries' refusal to pay for supplies in roubles? Both Poland and Bulgaria were already planning not to renew their contracts with the Russian energy giant, which expire at the end of the year. In Poland's case, it had been filling its stores of gas ahead of time, which provides some cushion, especially as we approach the summer lull in use of gas. This escalation is real, and justified by the Kremlin on the basis of a refusal to pay for gas by changing money into roubles in Russian bank accounts. But the additional impact of Wednesday's news should be containable and the actions of the Kremlin through Gazprom need to be put in perspective. Read Faisal's full analysis Civilians shelter in a bunker in eastern Ukraine Canada's parliament has unanimously condemned Russia's actions in Ukraine as ""genocide"". The lawmakers agreed on Wednesday that there was ""clear and ample evidence of systemic and massive war crimes against humanity"" by Russian troops. The presidents of Poland and the US have both labelled Russia's killing of civilians ""genocide"", but other world leaders - such as the president of France - have stopped short of the term. International law defines genocide as the deliberate âintent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group"". Last year, Canadian MPs also voted to condemn China's treatment of Uyghur people as genocide. Read more: Is Russia's committing genocide? Russian troops are putting pressure on Ukrainian journalists in areas under Moscow's control, according to Ukrainian human rights ombudsman Lyudmyla Denisova. Russian authorities in the Zaporizhzhya Region, in the south-east of Ukraine, were taking journalists hostage, questioning them, seizing their equipment and searching their residences, the UNIAN news agency quoted Denisova as saying. A large group of journalists was kidnapped in the port city of Berdyansk on 8 March and were made to provide the personal details of their colleagues, Denisova says. In the south-eastern city of Melitopol, Russians searched the house of Ukrainian news website editor, Svitlana Zalizetska, who had fled the city. Her father was captured and released only after the Russians gained control of the website. ""By unleashing hunts for Ukrainian journalists, the occupiers are trying to intimidate them and force them to spread the Kremlin's propaganda,"" Denisova says, adding that such actions were in breach of international humanitarian law. Here are some of the latest reports from on the ground in Ukraine. The BBC has not been able to verify the claims, which were all made by local Ukrainian officials. Also:  Kyiv's TV tower was targeted by a missile just as media companies were struck by hackers, Microsoft found Russian government hackers have carried out at least 37 cyber-attacks against Ukraine since the invasion began,Microsoft has said in a report,external. The tech giant's researchers said digital attacks on Ukraine began a year in advance of the invasion and may have laid the groundwork for military missions. It also found that hacking and military operations worked in tandem, focusing on the same targets, but Microsoft said it wasn't clear whether there was a co-ordinated plan or they were just driven by shared goals. On 1 March, the day a missile was fired at Kyiv's TV tower, media companies were hit by destructive hacks and cyber-espionage, the report found. While Russian forces laid siege to the city of Mariupol, Microsoft said Ukrainians began receiving emails from a Russian organisation pretending to be a Ukrainian resident, falsely accusing the government of ""abandoning"" its citizens. Victor Zhora, a Ukrainian cyber-security official, said he continues to see Russian hackers target telecoms companies and energy grid operators on a daily basis, Reuters reported. ""I believe that they can organise more attacks on these sectors. We shouldn't underestimate Russian hackers but we probably should not over-estimate their potential,"" he said. Katya AdlerEurope Editor For the EU itâs no longer whether, but when and how import bans on Russian oil and gas will be imposed on Moscow. EU countriesâ huge dependence on Russian energy has proved a
weakness in the current crisis. But the European Commission is having to work hard to
get all member states on board with the timing of oil sanctions. EU regulations say the decision must be unanimous. Big power
Germany is no longer opposed. Itâs just announced a reduction in Russian oil
dependency from 35% a few weeks ago to 12%. Italy prefers price caps on oil to phasing out Russian imports,
but Germany and others refuse. They say it would mean negotiating with Moscow (which the EU
says it doesnât want to do under the current circumstances) to find a mutually
agreeable price, or unilaterally paying Moscow less and risking the Russian oil
taps to the whole bloc suddenly being switched off. James LandaleDiplomatic correspondent The Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has said Russian forces must be
pushed out of ""the whole of Ukraine"", in what amounts to the clearest
statement yet of Britainâs war aims. Western powers are
turning their minds to how the war in Ukraine might end, and what they want
beyond a cessation of hostilities. In her speech in
London, Liz Truss said Russia had to be pushed out of âthe whole of Ukraineâ. That is the
clearest statement yet of Britainâs war aims and implies Russian forces must
leave not just the territory occupied in recent weeks but also those areas
invaded eight years ago, such as Crimea. Not all Western
powers may share such an ambitious target. The foreign
secretary also made clear the West should do more to deter future Russian
aggression, by spending more on defence and using its economic clout to exclude
Russia from western markets. She said the West
should beef up the defence capabilities not just of Ukraine but other
threatened countries too, such as Moldova and Georgia. If Russia were to
succeed, she said, there would be âuntold misery across Europeâ. Victory for
Ukraine was a ""strategic imperative"" for the West, she said. Read more on Truss's speech here. Vitaliy ShevchenkoBBC Monitoring A series of strategic locations in Russia have caught fire, including this fuel depot in Bryansk There have been a series of fires at strategic installations
in Russian areas bordering Ukraine recently, and while many fingers are
pointing at Ukraine, it has not confirmed its involvement. For example, this morning an arms depot in the Belgorod region
caught fire, and two days earlier, there was a fire at a fuel storage facility
in Bryansk. Before that, on 1 April, there were explosions at an oil depot in
Belgorod - whicha local official,externalblamed on an attack by two Ukrainian helicopters. This is a subject which officials in Moscow prefer to
avoid. Ukrainian attacks on Russian territory would be an embarrassment to the
Kremlin, which had been hoping to have control of Ukraine within days of
invading it in February. But Ukraine itself is evasive on whether it is behind the
incidents in Russia. Commenting on them, Ukrainian presidential adviserMykhaylo Podolyak,externalblamed them on
""various reasons"" such as ""karma"". It is clear why Ukraine would be reluctant to admit any
cross-border attacks: they would amount to a major escalation in an already
bitter conflict. Following on from a rocket attack in the Black Sea coastal city of Odesa at the weekend, loved ones and friends gathered to say farewell to a three-month-old girl, her mother and grandmother. The deaths - three generations in a single family - sparked outrage and revulsion in Ukraine. Yuriy Glodan, father and husband, had only left his flat and family to go to the shops when he heard the news of the explosion. ""All my world was destroyed"" by a Russian missile, Yuriy said. You can read more about Yuriy's devastating storyhere. We've been reporting on the situation at the Azovstal steel works in Mariupol, wherehundreds of injured soldiers and civilians are reportedly trapped insideand running out of supplies. Much of Mariupol has been destroyed, and the Azovstal plant - a maze of tunnels and workshops - is the last part of the port city not under Russian control. Taking the entire Sea of Azov port is one of Moscow's key aims. Speaking earlier to Portuguese media, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said work was continuing on a plan to evacuate hundreds of civilians from the steel plant. ""This is a very complicated operation,"" said Guterres, who has this evening arrived in Ukraine after meeting Vladimir Putin in Moscow yesterday. ""Putin agreed in principle and it was agreed that the details would be discussed in the meetings that are currently taking place,"" he said. ""This operation is particularly delicate, because we are not dealing with people who are in their homes, or in public places to be evacuated, but people who are, let's say, inside a bunker in truly dramatic conditions,"" he said. ""Our aim was to do this operation on Friday but naturally, the conditions must be in place for us to do that."" The White House spokeswoman has denounced Russia's move to cut off energy supplies to Poland and Bulgaria on Wednesday. ""Unfortunately this is the type of step, the type of almost weaponising energy supplies, that was predicted,"" Press Secretary Jen Psaki told reporters at a daily briefing. She added that the US has been in contact with the leaders of the two countries within the past 24 hours. Psaki also noted that the US has been ""working for some time now, for months, with partners around the world to diversity natural gas supplies to Europe"". She added thatthe prisoner swapearlier today with Russia was not an indication of a larger diplomatic breakthrough. The release of American Trevor Reed ""does not change our approach"" to the war in Ukraine, Psaki said. Katya AdlerEurope Editor Iâm
told by EU diplomats involved in negotiations that an EU ban on Russian oil (most likely
a phased-out one) could be introduced next week. The European Commission says
itâs consulting with the US and the G7 group of the worldâs wealthiest nations
before making an announcement. The aim is that the blocâs oil sanctions be tough
enough to hurt Vladimir Putin but not so dramatic as to send shockwaves
through the global oil market - never mind the EUâs. Brussels says itâs aware
that countries rich and poor rely on oil. It says it wants to avoid provoking
global price hikes, which could in turn also undermine international support
for Western sanctions against Russia. Vladimir Putin (L) met AntÃ³nio Guterres in Moscow on Wednesday Fresh fromhis visit to Russia to meet Vladimir Putin,the UN Secretary General AntÃ³nio Guterres has arrived in Kyiv. He's due to hold talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Thursday. Writing on Twitter, Guterres said:,external""We will continue our work to expand humanitarian support and secure the evacuation of civilians from conflict zones.

The sooner this war ends, the better - for the sake of Ukraine, Russia, and the world."" President Zelensky said Russia sees a united Europe as a target for ""political blackmail"" Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has just delivered his nightly video message to the nation, in which he addresses what he calls Russia's ""energy blackmail"" against Europe. He says cutting off gas supplies to Poland and Bulgaria shows that ""no one in Europe can hope to maintain any normal economic cooperation with Russia"". Zelensky adds: ""Russia considers not only gas, but any trade as a weapon. It is just waiting for the moment when one or another trade area can be used."" He says Russia ""sees a united Europe as a target"" and the sooner everyone in the continent agrees that they cannot depend on Russia for trade, the sooner there will be stability. The Ukrainian president also welcomed a deal with the EU to suspend duties and quotas on Ukraine's exports, saying Russia wanted to create chaos in global markets - especially for food. Ukrainian exports would help stabilise markets and support the country's economy during the crisis, he said. Here are some pictures from today that show the devastation caused by the war, on the ground across Ukraine. In Irpin, a city near Ukraine's capital Kyiv, the House of Culture was destroyed by Russian troops. Pictured below is Mykola Nahornyi, 59, at his house, which he says was destroyed by Russian shelling on 7 March. He returned today to try to recover what remains from his belongings in Kolychivka, in the Chernihiv region in the north of Ukraine. In Kyiv, people have been attending a funeral ceremony of a Ukrainian soldier. The funeral was held in a particular area reserved for soldiers at Miske Cemetery in the capital. Also in Kyiv, people have been attending a demonstration at Independence Square in support of the south-eastern city of Mariupol. The remaining Ukrainian soldiers in the city, and some civilians, are still trapped at the Azovstal steel plant. Reality Check The Russian state-owned energy company, Gazprom, hascut off supplies to Poland and Bulgaria, and says it will not resume until payments are made in roubles. It's led to accusations that President Putin is trying to hit back economically at western countries which are supporting Ukraine against the Russian invasion. In 2019, Russia accounted for41% of the EU's natural gas imports,external. If Russian gas supplies to Europe dried up, Italy and Germany would be especially vulnerableas they import the most,external. But its also a question of how much gas a country is able to store: currently Poland's gas storage is 76% full, but Bulgaria's sits at just 17%. Bulgaria says it is looking to increase the amount of gas it receives from Azerbaijan, as well as making deals with Turkey and Greece; Poland is building a new pipeline connecting it to Norway's gas fields and looking to neighbouring Lithuania for supplies. Looking more widely, Europe could turn to existing gas exporters such Qatar, Algeria or Nigeria - but there are practical obstacles to quickly expanding production. The continent could also ramp up the use of other energy sources - such as renewables - but doing so is not quick or easy. So what happens next? Read on to find out who imports what and the steps being taken to reduce dependence on Russian energy. Paul AdamsBBC Diplomatic correspondent Western officials have been briefing on the latest in the war and they say Russia has continued to build up forces in and around the Donbas and are making minor gains. ""But when they come up against genuine military objectives, they are finding it difficult to overcome the staunch Ukrainian resistance and they are suffering losses,"" an official said. Heavy rain is also hampering Russian progress. ""Russians don't like to fight in the rain,â an official said, adding that the Russians have poor tactical awareness and continue to suffer from logistical difficulties. They have the ability to operate off road, but officials say itâs surprising that they still choose not to do so. Even in places where Ukrainian forces have found themselves encircled, they have managed to resupply their forces ""for a surprising length of time"". (Mariupol being the most obvious example). Officials noted that even in places where Russia has taken ground, Ukrainian forces have shown a âremarkableâ ability to counter-attack - sometimes doing it so fast that the Russians quickly find themselves on the back foot. Ukrainian special forces, operating behind Russian lines, are exploiting the vulnerability of long supply lines, which helps to buy time for Ukraine. If you're just joining us, earlier we brought you the news that Vladimir Putin has made a fresh threat to the West, sayingany country that sets out to intervene in Ukraine will face a ""lightning-fast""military response. ""We have all the tools for this, that no one else can boast of having... we'll use them, if needed,"" he said. ""We have already taken all the decisions on this."" His latest warning comes after Western countries have ramped up support for Ukraine in the past days. Yesterday, the US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin pledged to move ""heaven and earth"" to make sure Ukraine defeats Russia. And in recent days, there has been an increasing number of pledges to increase military support to Ukraine, including Germany's announcement that it will send 50 anti-aircraft tanks, in a sharp U-turn in policy. The UK is also expected to call later for fighter jetsto be provided to Ukraine. Earlier this week, Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov also claimed the West was âpouring oil on
the fireâ by providing Ukraine with firepower - and said the conflict could lead to World War Three. Putin's warning comes as tensions were heightened further today as Russian energy provider Gazprom cut off gas supplies to Poland and Bulgaria, saying it's because the countries refused to follow Moscow's new rule to pay for gas in roubles. If you're just joining us, here are the main developments in Ukraine today: Putin warns West and Gazprom cuts gas  Other developments Â© 2025 BBC.

One in five reptiles is threatened with extinction,"The venomous king cobra is in decline because of deforestation and human persecution One in five reptiles is threatened with extinction, according to the first comprehensive assessment of more than 10,000 species across the world. Scientists are calling for urgent conservation action for crocodiles and turtles, which are in a particularly dire situation. They say reptiles have long been overlooked in conservation, because they are seen as less charismatic than ""furry and feathery"" creatures. So far, 31 species have gone extinct. The study, published in Nature, took more than 15 years to complete, because of problems getting funding for the work. ""Reptiles to many people are not charismatic and there's been a lot more focus on more furry, feathery species of vertebrates for conservation,"" said Dr Bruce Young of the international nature organisation, NatureServe. Extinction: 'Urgent change' needed to save nature Pressure grows for global deal to save nature 'Billions of years of evolutionary history' under threat Geckos are vanishing in parts of the world due to wildlife trade Despite their low publicity profile, the cold-blooded vertebrates play an essential role in the balance of life. ""Reptiles are good for people because they help control pests such as insects and rodents,"" said Prof Blair Hedges of Temple University in Philadelphia, US. By publicising the plight of these ""truly spectacular species"", the scientists hope to help slow the slide towards oblivion of reptiles such as the loggerhead sea turtle and the gharial, or fish-eating crocodile. And there is a glimmer of hope in that measures put in place to protect rare birds and mammals also safeguard many of the reptiles that share the same land. The mugger crocodile: Threatened by habitat destruction and human conflict The study found: 21% of reptile species are threatened (1,800 individual species); which is higher than for birds, but lower than for mammals and amphibians More than half of crocodiles and almost two thirds of turtles are threatened with extinction Reptiles are threatened throughout the world, but particularly in southeast Asia, West Africa, northern Madagascar, the northern Andes and the Caribbean Habitat destruction from the expansion of farmland, urban development and logging is a big factor pushing reptiles to the brink. Crocodiles and turtles also face threats from hunting Reptiles found in forests are more at risk than those living in deserts and savannahs Climate change is a looming threat to reptiles, particularly on low-lying islands If we were to lose all reptile species at risk of extinction, 15.6 billion years of phylogenetic biodiversity (a measure of genetic variation based on the tree of life) would be wiped from the planet. Lizards are generally less threatened than other reptiles Speaking at a news conference, the study authors highlighted the need for a new worldwide agreement to stem extinctions. Neil Cox of the IUCN-Conservation International Biodiversity Assessment Unit said negotiations at the upcoming summit on biodiversity in Kunming, China, will be critical for trying to turn the tide on biodiversity loss. ""The hope is that we can really start making efforts to reverse this extinction catastrophe,"" he said. The final version of the draft UN Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) will be negotiated at the COP15 summit, which is expected to take place at the end of August. Jamaican iguana: Reptiles on islands face risks from invasive species and sea level rise What's needed to save animals and plants from extinction? The outcome will decide for the coming decades how the world will address the challenges of reducing the extinction risk threatening more than one million species, eliminating billions of dollars of environmentally-damaging government subsidies and restoring degraded ecosystems.

Police face misconduct panel over athlete search,"This video can not be played Footage of the stop was shared widely on Twitter, after being posted by former Olympic 100m champion Linford Christie Five Metropolitan Police officers will face a gross-misconduct hearing over the stop-and-search of Team GB athlete Bianca Williams, following an investigation by the police watchdog. The British sprinter, 28, and her partner, were stopped in their car, in west London, in July 2020. The couple were handcuffed, searched for weapons and drugs and separated from their three-month-old son. An independent panel will now determine whether to uphold the allegations. The Metropolitan Police referred itself to the Independent Office of Police Conduct (IOPC) after footage of the stop-and-search was posted online by former Olympic champion sprinter Linford Christie, who trains Ms Williams and her partner, Portuguese sprinter Ricardo dos Santos. The couple believe they were racially profiled and stopped because they are black. Ms Williams, a Commonwealth Games gold medallist, said the decision to hold a hearing ""opens the door for the Met to start being more honest and reflective about the culture of racism which is undoubtedly still a reality within the organisation"". Bianca Williams believes she was racially profiled Publishing the findings of the IOPC investigation, on Wednesday, regional director Sal Naseem said all five officers - an acting sergeant and four constables - would face allegations they had breached police standards of professional behaviour for duties and responsibilities and for equality and diversity. Four officers also face allegations they breached the standards for use of force and for authority, respect and courtesy. Three of the constables will face allegations they breached the standards for honesty and integrity and one will face an allegation they breached the police standards of professional behaviour for orders and instructions. A sixth officer will attend a misconduct meeting related to the stop-and-search. If a police officer is found guilty of gross misconduct, disciplinary action can include being sacked, demoted or receiving a written warning. Met Police Deputy Assistant Commissioner Bas Javid said sorry for the ""distress that this incident clearly caused Ms Williams and Mr Dos Santos"" - repeating an apology made by the force three days after the search. ""We have co-operated fully with the IOPC's investigation and, in accordance with their direction, are now arranging for an independently led misconduct hearing to take place,"" he added. London Mayor Sadiq Khan welcomed the IOPC's findings and called for the hearing to be as soon as possible. ""This case is yet another example of why it is vital that the next [Met Police] commissioner has a more effective plan to tackle the serious cultural issues within the Met Police and to regain the trust of Londoners,"" he said. Ms Williams and her partner, Portuguese sprinter Ricardo dos Santos, welcomed news of the gross-misconduct hearing Dame Cressida Dick quit as Met Police commissioner in February, when Mr Khan said he had lost confidence in her leadership. A few weeks after the stop-and-search of Ms Williams and Mr Dos Santos, Dame Cressida had told LBC radio she did not ""personally accept"" the video footage ""reveals racism"". Ms Williams said Dame Cressida had made ""public efforts to discredit and undermine our complaints and to trivialise the experiences of black people in the UK and how we are policed"". ""I sincerely hope that the Met's culture of sweeping these issues under the carpet ends with the former commissioner,"" she added. Met Police chief Cressida Dick to step down The crises and controversies of Cressida Dick The IOPC said the Met should consider apologising for comments made shortly after the search by Dame Cressida's Deputy Commissioner at the time, Sir Stephen House. In July 2020, he told the London Assembly Police and Crime Committee internal reviews of the footage had not highlighted ""anything wrong"" with the officers' conduct. In response, a Met official said on Wednesday: ""Sir Stephen stands by his statement as being factually correct at the time and has written to the IOPC to reinforce the importance of senior officers being able to respond to questions from our scrutiny bodies openly and transparently and for advice and clarification of the IOPC's view of how he and his fellow chief officers, both in the Met and nationally, should respond to similar direct questioning in future.""

Russian authorities in the Zaporizhzhya Region, in the south-east of Ukraine, were taking journalists hostage, questioning them, seizing their equipment and searching their residences, the UNIAN news agency quoted Denisova as saying. A large group of journalists was kidnapped in the port city of Berdyansk on 8 March and were made to provide the personal details of their colleagues, Denisova says. In the south-eastern city of Melitopol, Russians searched the house of Ukrainian news website editor, Svitlana Zalizetska, who had fled the city. Her father was captured and released only after the Russians gained control of the website. ""By unleashing hunts for Ukrainian journalists, the occupiers are trying to intimidate them and force them to spread the Kremlin's propaganda,"" Denisova says, adding that such actions were in breach of international humanitarian law. Here are some of the latest reports from on the ground in Ukraine. The BBC has not been able to verify the claims, which were all made by local Ukrainian officials. Also:  Kyiv's TV tower was targeted by a missile just as media companies were struck by hackers, Microsoft found Russian government hackers have carried out at least 37 cyber-attacks against Ukraine since the invasion began,Microsoft has said in a report,external. The tech giant's researchers said digital attacks on Ukraine began a year in advance of the invasion and may have laid the groundwork for military missions. It also found that hacking and military operations worked in tandem, focusing on the same targets, but Microsoft said it wasn't clear whether there was a co-ordinated plan or they were just driven by shared goals. On 1 March, the day a missile was fired at Kyiv's TV tower, media companies were hit by destructive hacks and cyber-espionage, the report found. While Russian forces laid siege to the city of Mariupol, Microsoft said Ukrainians began receiving emails from a Russian organisation pretending to be a Ukrainian resident, falsely accusing the government of ""abandoning"" its citizens. Victor Zhora, a Ukrainian cyber-security official, said he continues to see Russian hackers target telecoms companies and energy grid operators on a daily basis, Reuters reported. ""I believe that they can organise more attacks on these sectors. We shouldn't underestimate Russian hackers but we probably should not over-estimate their potential,"" he said. Katya AdlerEurope Editor For the EU itâs no longer whether, but when and how import bans on Russian oil and gas will be imposed on Moscow. EU countriesâ huge dependence on Russian energy has proved a
weakness in the current crisis. But the European Commission is having to work hard to
get all member states on board with the timing of oil sanctions. EU regulations say the decision must be unanimous. Big power
Germany is no longer opposed. Itâs just announced a reduction in Russian oil
dependency from 35% a few weeks ago to 12%. Italy prefers price caps on oil to phasing out Russian imports,
but Germany and others refuse. They say it would mean negotiating with Moscow (which the EU
says it doesnât want to do under the current circumstances) to find a mutually
agreeable price, or unilaterally paying Moscow less and risking the Russian oil
taps to the whole bloc suddenly being switched off. James LandaleDiplomatic correspondent The Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has said Russian forces must be
pushed out of ""the whole of Ukraine"", in what amounts to the clearest
statement yet of Britainâs war aims. Western powers are
turning their minds to how the war in Ukraine might end, and what they want
beyond a cessation of hostilities. In her speech in
London, Liz Truss said Russia had to be pushed out of âthe whole of Ukraineâ. That is the
clearest statement yet of Britainâs war aims and implies Russian forces must
leave not just the territory occupied in recent weeks but also those areas
invaded eight years ago, such as Crimea. Not all Western
powers may share such an ambitious target. The foreign
secretary also made clear the West should do more to deter future Russian
aggression, by spending more on defence and using its economic clout to exclude
Russia from western markets. She said the West
should beef up the defence capabilities not just of Ukraine but other
threatened countries too, such as Moldova and Georgia. If Russia were to
succeed, she said, there would be âuntold misery across Europeâ. Victory for
Ukraine was a ""strategic imperative"" for the West, she said. Read more on Truss's speech here. Vitaliy ShevchenkoBBC Monitoring A series of strategic locations in Russia have caught fire, including this fuel depot in Bryansk There have been a series of fires at strategic installations
in Russian areas bordering Ukraine recently, and while many fingers are
pointing at Ukraine, it has not confirmed its involvement. For example, this morning an arms depot in the Belgorod region
caught fire, and two days earlier, there was a fire at a fuel storage facility
in Bryansk. Before that, on 1 April, there were explosions at an oil depot in
Belgorod - whicha local official,externalblamed on an attack by two Ukrainian helicopters. This is a subject which officials in Moscow prefer to
avoid. Ukrainian attacks on Russian territory would be an embarrassment to the
Kremlin, which had been hoping to have control of Ukraine within days of
invading it in February. But Ukraine itself is evasive on whether it is behind the
incidents in Russia. Commenting on them, Ukrainian presidential adviserMykhaylo Podolyak,externalblamed them on
""various reasons"" such as ""karma"". It is clear why Ukraine would be reluctant to admit any
cross-border attacks: they would amount to a major escalation in an already
bitter conflict. Following on from a rocket attack in the Black Sea coastal city of Odesa at the weekend, loved ones and friends gathered to say farewell to a three-month-old girl, her mother and grandmother. The deaths - three generations in a single family - sparked outrage and revulsion in Ukraine. Yuriy Glodan, father and husband, had only left his flat and family to go to the shops when he heard the news of the explosion. ""All my world was destroyed"" by a Russian missile, Yuriy said. You can read more about Yuriy's devastating storyhere. We've been reporting on the situation at the Azovstal steel works in Mariupol, wherehundreds of injured soldiers and civilians are reportedly trapped insideand running out of supplies. Much of Mariupol has been destroyed, and the Azovstal plant - a maze of tunnels and workshops - is the last part of the port city not under Russian control. Taking the entire Sea of Azov port is one of Moscow's key aims. Speaking earlier to Portuguese media, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said work was continuing on a plan to evacuate hundreds of civilians from the steel plant. ""This is a very complicated operation,"" said Guterres, who has this evening arrived in Ukraine after meeting Vladimir Putin in Moscow yesterday. ""Putin agreed in principle and it was agreed that the details would be discussed in the meetings that are currently taking place,"" he said. ""This operation is particularly delicate, because we are not dealing with people who are in their homes, or in public places to be evacuated, but people who are, let's say, inside a bunker in truly dramatic conditions,"" he said. ""Our aim was to do this operation on Friday but naturally, the conditions must be in place for us to do that."" The White House spokeswoman has denounced Russia's move to cut off energy supplies to Poland and Bulgaria on Wednesday. ""Unfortunately this is the type of step, the type of almost weaponising energy supplies, that was predicted,"" Press Secretary Jen Psaki told reporters at a daily briefing. She added that the US has been in contact with the leaders of the two countries within the past 24 hours. Psaki also noted that the US has been ""working for some time now, for months, with partners around the world to diversity natural gas supplies to Europe"". She added thatthe prisoner swapearlier today with Russia was not an indication of a larger diplomatic breakthrough. The release of American Trevor Reed ""does not change our approach"" to the war in Ukraine, Psaki said. Katya AdlerEurope Editor Iâm
told by EU diplomats involved in negotiations that an EU ban on Russian oil (most likely
a phased-out one) could be introduced next week. The European Commission says
itâs consulting with the US and the G7 group of the worldâs wealthiest nations
before making an announcement. The aim is that the blocâs oil sanctions be tough
enough to hurt Vladimir Putin but not so dramatic as to send shockwaves
through the global oil market - never mind the EUâs. Brussels says itâs aware
that countries rich and poor rely on oil. It says it wants to avoid provoking
global price hikes, which could in turn also undermine international support
for Western sanctions against Russia. Vladimir Putin (L) met AntÃ³nio Guterres in Moscow on Wednesday Fresh fromhis visit to Russia to meet Vladimir Putin,the UN Secretary General AntÃ³nio Guterres has arrived in Kyiv. He's due to hold talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Thursday. Writing on Twitter, Guterres said:,external""We will continue our work to expand humanitarian support and secure the evacuation of civilians from conflict zones.

The sooner this war ends, the better - for the sake of Ukraine, Russia, and the world."" President Zelensky said Russia sees a united Europe as a target for ""political blackmail"" Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has just delivered his nightly video message to the nation, in which he addresses what he calls Russia's ""energy blackmail"" against Europe. He says cutting off gas supplies to Poland and Bulgaria shows that ""no one in Europe can hope to maintain any normal economic cooperation with Russia"". Zelensky adds: ""Russia considers not only gas, but any trade as a weapon. It is just waiting for the moment when one or another trade area can be used."" He says Russia ""sees a united Europe as a target"" and the sooner everyone in the continent agrees that they cannot depend on Russia for trade, the sooner there will be stability. The Ukrainian president also welcomed a deal with the EU to suspend duties and quotas on Ukraine's exports, saying Russia wanted to create chaos in global markets - especially for food. Ukrainian exports would help stabilise markets and support the country's economy during the crisis, he said. Here are some pictures from today that show the devastation caused by the war, on the ground across Ukraine. In Irpin, a city near Ukraine's capital Kyiv, the House of Culture was destroyed by Russian troops. Pictured below is Mykola Nahornyi, 59, at his house, which he says was destroyed by Russian shelling on 7 March. He returned today to try to recover what remains from his belongings in Kolychivka, in the Chernihiv region in the north of Ukraine. In Kyiv, people have been attending a funeral ceremony of a Ukrainian soldier. The funeral was held in a particular area reserved for soldiers at Miske Cemetery in the capital. Also in Kyiv, people have been attending a demonstration at Independence Square in support of the south-eastern city of Mariupol. The remaining Ukrainian soldiers in the city, and some civilians, are still trapped at the Azovstal steel plant. Reality Check The Russian state-owned energy company, Gazprom, hascut off supplies to Poland and Bulgaria, and says it will not resume until payments are made in roubles. It's led to accusations that President Putin is trying to hit back economically at western countries which are supporting Ukraine against the Russian invasion. In 2019, Russia accounted for41% of the EU's natural gas imports,external. If Russian gas supplies to Europe dried up, Italy and Germany would be especially vulnerableas they import the most,external. But its also a question of how much gas a country is able to store: currently Poland's gas storage is 76% full, but Bulgaria's sits at just 17%. Bulgaria says it is looking to increase the amount of gas it receives from Azerbaijan, as well as making deals with Turkey and Greece; Poland is building a new pipeline connecting it to Norway's gas fields and looking to neighbouring Lithuania for supplies. Looking more widely, Europe could turn to existing gas exporters such Qatar, Algeria or Nigeria - but there are practical obstacles to quickly expanding production. The continent could also ramp up the use of other energy sources - such as renewables - but doing so is not quick or easy. So what happens next? Read on to find out who imports what and the steps being taken to reduce dependence on Russian energy. Paul AdamsBBC Diplomatic correspondent Western officials have been briefing on the latest in the war and they say Russia has continued to build up forces in and around the Donbas and are making minor gains. ""But when they come up against genuine military objectives, they are finding it difficult to overcome the staunch Ukrainian resistance and they are suffering losses,"" an official said. Heavy rain is also hampering Russian progress. ""Russians don't like to fight in the rain,â an official said, adding that the Russians have poor tactical awareness and continue to suffer from logistical difficulties. They have the ability to operate off road, but officials say itâs surprising that they still choose not to do so. Even in places where Ukrainian forces have found themselves encircled, they have managed to resupply their forces ""for a surprising length of time"". (Mariupol being the most obvious example). Officials noted that even in places where Russia has taken ground, Ukrainian forces have shown a âremarkableâ ability to counter-attack - sometimes doing it so fast that the Russians quickly find themselves on the back foot. Ukrainian special forces, operating behind Russian lines, are exploiting the vulnerability of long supply lines, which helps to buy time for Ukraine. If you're just joining us, earlier we brought you the news that Vladimir Putin has made a fresh threat to the West, sayingany country that sets out to intervene in Ukraine will face a ""lightning-fast""military response. ""We have all the tools for this, that no one else can boast of having... we'll use them, if needed,"" he said. ""We have already taken all the decisions on this."" His latest warning comes after Western countries have ramped up support for Ukraine in the past days. Yesterday, the US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin pledged to move ""heaven and earth"" to make sure Ukraine defeats Russia. And in recent days, there has been an increasing number of pledges to increase military support to Ukraine, including Germany's announcement that it will send 50 anti-aircraft tanks, in a sharp U-turn in policy. The UK is also expected to call later for fighter jetsto be provided to Ukraine. Earlier this week, Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov also claimed the West was âpouring oil on
the fireâ by providing Ukraine with firepower - and said the conflict could lead to World War Three. Putin's warning comes as tensions were heightened further today as Russian energy provider Gazprom cut off gas supplies to Poland and Bulgaria, saying it's because the countries refused to follow Moscow's new rule to pay for gas in roubles.

Our live coverage of the war in Ukraine will restart on Thursday morning Kyiv time. Join our continuing updateshere now. Ukrainian refugees from Mariupol arrive in Zaporizhzhia Faisal IslamBBC Economics Editor How worried should we be about Gazprom's decision to halt gas exports to Poland and Bulgaria over the countries' refusal to pay for supplies in roubles? Both Poland and Bulgaria were already planning not to renew their contracts with the Russian energy giant, which expire at the end of the year. In Poland's case, it had been filling its stores of gas ahead of time, which provides some cushion, especially as we approach the summer lull in use of gas. This escalation is real, and justified by the Kremlin on the basis of a refusal to pay for gas by changing money into roubles in Russian bank accounts. But the additional impact of Wednesday's news should be containable and the actions of the Kremlin through Gazprom need to be put in perspective. Read Faisal's full analysis Civilians shelter in a bunker in eastern Ukraine Canada's parliament has unanimously condemned Russia's actions in Ukraine as ""genocide"". The lawmakers agreed on Wednesday that there was ""clear and ample evidence of systemic and massive war crimes against humanity"" by Russian troops. The presidents of Poland and the US have both labelled Russia's killing of civilians ""genocide"", but other world leaders - such as the president of France - have stopped short of the term. International law defines genocide as the deliberate âintent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group"". Last year, Canadian MPs also voted to condemn China's treatment of Uyghur people as genocide. Read more: Is Russia's committing genocide?

West should provide warplanes to Ukraine - Truss,"Britain and other Western powers should provide warplanes to Ukraine, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss will say, as part of long-term military support. In a major speech in London, Ms Truss will argue that the West ""must be prepared for the long haul and double down on our support"" for the country. Since Russia's invasion, Ukraine has repeatedly asked allies to supply heavy armaments such as aeroplanes and tanks. Nato has provided mostly only lighter weaponry amid fears of escalation. Ms Truss will tell an audience at Mansion House, in the City of London, that ""the fate of Ukraine remains in the balance"" and that the West ""cannot be complacent"". ""If Putin succeeds there will be untold further misery across Europe and terrible consequences across the globe. We would never feel safe again,"" she will say on Wednesday evening. ""Heavy weapons, tanks, aeroplanes - digging deep into our inventories, ramping up production. We need to do all of this."" Later, Downing Street said the government would not rule out training Ukrainian pilots or sending British jets to eastern Europe to ""backfill"" for allies who supply jets to Kyiv. ""Whilst there are no plans to send things like planes from the UK, certainly we want to work with other countries to ensure that Ukraine has the equipment that it needs,"" the prime minister's spokesman said. What is Nato and how is it helping Ukraine? The West is united for now - but what if it splits? Russia accuses UK of provoking attacks on its soil Ms Truss will also reiterate a call for a boost in UK defence spending. But Labour's shadow foreign secretary, David Lammy, said the speech ""appears to be an admission of failure after more than a decade of decline"" in the government's commitment to defence and security. Liz Truss's call for Ukraine to be given warplanes follows a growing trend. Western powers are ratcheting up military support for the country. Drones, long range artillery, better anti-aircraft defence systems. So why not fighter jets? Well, some countries - like Poland - have said they were willing to give Ukraine some aging MIG29s. But it has not happened. That's because Poland wanted the United States to replace the donated MIGs with newer, American combat aircraft. Poland also wanted the US to deliver the MIGs to Ukraine themselves. The US refused to do this, citing logistical difficulties and the risk of provoking Russia by flying aircraft from a Nato base into contested airspace. As of last week, the Pentagon said that while Ukraine might have received spare parts for planes, it had not received an entire aircraft from any country. Ukraine would dearly love some ground attack warplanes to target Russian armour and artillery. But that appears unlikely until such time that the scale of Western support for Ukraine is such that aircraft become a natural next step, and the need to help Kyiv outweighs the risk of Moscow escalating the conflict. So Ms Truss's remarks do not mean that RAF warplanes are about to be sent to Ukraine soon. What she is saying is that the option of giving Ukraine airpower should remain on the table. The trouble is that the loose language in the pre-briefed elements of her speech have triggered a debate that Western allies might not need right now. Asked three times if he backed his colleague's call to send planes, former foreign secretary - now deputy PM - Dominic Raab would not answer. But he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""We need to listen very carefully to what the Ukrainians need."" The speech comes just days after Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki confirmed his country had sent tanks to Ukraine. Germany has also pledged to send about 50 anti-aircraft tanks. As well as her demand for more defence spending at home, Ms Truss will argue that Nato's target of 2% of GDP - which the UK met last year - should be ""a floor, not a ceiling"". She will say there has been a ""generation of under-investment"" in the West, and the Russian invasion showed ""the architecture that was designed to guarantee peace and prosperity has failed Ukraine"". Labour's Mr Lammy said: ""The Conservatives wrongly de-emphasised European security in the Integrated Review, made deep cuts to the British army over many years, gave up soft power through cutting development, and hurt alliances with Europe and the United States, including by risking peace in Northern Ireland."" Prime Minster Boris Johnson said on Tuesday he would be happy for Ukrainian forces to use British-supplied weapons to strike targets inside Russia to protect themselves. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has said that, by arming Ukraine, Nato had already effectively ""entered into a war with Russia through proxies"".

Our live coverage of the war in Ukraine will restart on Thursday morning Kyiv time. Join our continuing updateshere now. Ukrainian refugees from Mariupol arrive in Zaporizhzhia Faisal IslamBBC Economics Editor How worried should we be about Gazprom's decision to halt gas exports to Poland and Bulgaria over the countries' refusal to pay for supplies in roubles? Both Poland and Bulgaria were already planning not to renew their contracts with the Russian energy giant, which expire at the end of the year. In Poland's case, it had been filling its stores of gas ahead of time, which provides some cushion, especially as we approach the summer lull in use of gas. This escalation is real, and justified by the Kremlin on the basis of a refusal to pay for gas by changing money into roubles in Russian bank accounts. But the additional impact of Wednesday's news should be containable and the actions of the Kremlin through Gazprom need to be put in perspective. Read Faisal's full analysis Civilians shelter in a bunker in eastern Ukraine Canada's parliament has unanimously condemned Russia's actions in Ukraine as ""genocide"". The lawmakers agreed on Wednesday that there was ""clear and ample evidence of systemic and massive war crimes against humanity"" by Russian troops. The presidents of Poland and the US have both labelled Russia's killing of civilians ""genocide"", but other world leaders - such as the president of France - have stopped short of the term. International law defines genocide as the deliberate âintent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group"". Last year, Canadian MPs also voted to condemn China's treatment of Uyghur people as genocide. Read more: Is Russia's committing genocide? Russian troops are putting pressure on Ukrainian journalists in areas under Moscow's control, according to Ukrainian human rights ombudsman Lyudmyla Denisova. Russian authorities in the Zaporizhzhya Region, in the south-east of Ukraine, were taking journalists hostage, questioning them, seizing their equipment and searching their residences, the UNIAN news agency quoted Denisova as saying. A large group of journalists was kidnapped in the port city of Berdyansk on 8 March and were made to provide the personal details of their colleagues, Denisova says. In the south-eastern city of Melitopol, Russians searched the house of Ukrainian news website editor, Svitlana Zalizetska, who had fled the city. Her father was captured and released only after the Russians gained control of the website. ""By unleashing hunts for Ukrainian journalists, the occupiers are trying to intimidate them and force them to spread the Kremlin's propaganda,"" Denisova says, adding that such actions were in breach of international humanitarian law. Here are some of the latest reports from on the ground in Ukraine. The BBC has not been able to verify the claims, which were all made by local Ukrainian officials. Also:  Kyiv's TV tower was targeted by a missile just as media companies were struck by hackers, Microsoft found Russian government hackers have carried out at least 37 cyber-attacks against Ukraine since the invasion began,Microsoft has said in a report,external. The tech giant's researchers said digital attacks on Ukraine began a year in advance of the invasion and may have laid the groundwork for military missions. It also found that hacking and military operations worked in tandem, focusing on the same targets, but Microsoft said it wasn't clear whether there was a co-ordinated plan or they were just driven by shared goals. On 1 March, the day a missile was fired at Kyiv's TV tower, media companies were hit by destructive hacks and cyber-espionage, the report found. While Russian forces laid siege to the city of Mariupol, Microsoft said Ukrainians began receiving emails from a Russian organisation pretending to be a Ukrainian resident, falsely accusing the government of ""abandoning"" its citizens. Victor Zhora, a Ukrainian cyber-security official, said he continues to see Russian hackers target telecoms companies and energy grid operators on a daily basis, Reuters reported. ""I believe that they can organise more attacks on these sectors. We shouldn't underestimate Russian hackers but we probably should not over-estimate their potential,"" he said. Katya AdlerEurope Editor For the EU itâs no longer whether, but when and how import bans on Russian oil and gas will be imposed on Moscow. EU countriesâ huge dependence on Russian energy has proved a
weakness in the current crisis. But the European Commission is having to work hard to
get all member states on board with the timing of oil sanctions. EU regulations say the decision must be unanimous. Big power
Germany is no longer opposed. Itâs just announced a reduction in Russian oil
dependency from 35% a few weeks ago to 12%. Italy prefers price caps on oil to phasing out Russian imports,
but Germany and others refuse. They say it would mean negotiating with Moscow (which the EU
says it doesnât want to do under the current circumstances) to find a mutually
agreeable price, or unilaterally paying Moscow less and risking the Russian oil
taps to the whole bloc suddenly being switched off. James LandaleDiplomatic correspondent The Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has said Russian forces must be
pushed out of ""the whole of Ukraine"", in what amounts to the clearest
statement yet of Britainâs war aims. Western powers are
turning their minds to how the war in Ukraine might end, and what they want
beyond a cessation of hostilities. In her speech in
London, Liz Truss said Russia had to be pushed out of âthe whole of Ukraineâ. That is the
clearest statement yet of Britainâs war aims and implies Russian forces must
leave not just the territory occupied in recent weeks but also those areas
invaded eight years ago, such as Crimea. Not all Western
powers may share such an ambitious target. The foreign
secretary also made clear the West should do more to deter future Russian
aggression, by spending more on defence and using its economic clout to exclude
Russia from western markets. She said the West
should beef up the defence capabilities not just of Ukraine but other
threatened countries too, such as Moldova and Georgia. If Russia were to
succeed, she said, there would be âuntold misery across Europeâ. Victory for
Ukraine was a ""strategic imperative"" for the West, she said. Read more on Truss's speech here. Vitaliy ShevchenkoBBC Monitoring A series of strategic locations in Russia have caught fire, including this fuel depot in Bryansk There have been a series of fires at strategic installations
in Russian areas bordering Ukraine recently, and while many fingers are
pointing at Ukraine, it has not confirmed its involvement. For example, this morning an arms depot in the Belgorod region
caught fire, and two days earlier, there was a fire at a fuel storage facility
in Bryansk. Before that, on 1 April, there were explosions at an oil depot in
Belgorod - whicha local official,externalblamed on an attack by two Ukrainian helicopters. This is a subject which officials in Moscow prefer to
avoid. Ukrainian attacks on Russian territory would be an embarrassment to the
Kremlin, which had been hoping to have control of Ukraine within days of
invading it in February. But Ukraine itself is evasive on whether it is behind the
incidents in Russia. Commenting on them, Ukrainian presidential adviserMykhaylo Podolyak,externalblamed them on
""various reasons"" such as ""karma"". It is clear why Ukraine would be reluctant to admit any
cross-border attacks: they would amount to a major escalation in an already
bitter conflict. Following on from a rocket attack in the Black Sea coastal city of Odesa at the weekend, loved ones and friends gathered to say farewell to a three-month-old girl, her mother and grandmother. The deaths - three generations in a single family - sparked outrage and revulsion in Ukraine. Yuriy Glodan, father and husband, had only left his flat and family to go to the shops when he heard the news of the explosion. ""All my world was destroyed"" by a Russian missile, Yuriy said. You can read more about Yuriy's devastating storyhere. We've been reporting on the situation at the Azovstal steel works in Mariupol, wherehundreds of injured soldiers and civilians are reportedly trapped insideand running out of supplies. Much of Mariupol has been destroyed, and the Azovstal plant - a maze of tunnels and workshops - is the last part of the port city not under Russian control. Taking the entire Sea of Azov port is one of Moscow's key aims. Speaking earlier to Portuguese media, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said work was continuing on a plan to evacuate hundreds of civilians from the steel plant. ""This is a very complicated operation,"" said Guterres, who has this evening arrived in Ukraine after meeting Vladimir Putin in Moscow yesterday. ""Putin agreed in principle and it was agreed that the details would be discussed in the meetings that are currently taking place,"" he said. ""This operation is particularly delicate, because we are not dealing with people who are in their homes, or in public places to be evacuated, but people who are, let's say, inside a bunker in truly dramatic conditions,"" he said. ""Our aim was to do this operation on Friday but naturally, the conditions must be in place for us to do that."" The White House spokeswoman has denounced Russia's move to cut off energy supplies to Poland and Bulgaria on Wednesday. ""Unfortunately this is the type of step, the type of almost weaponising energy supplies, that was predicted,"" Press Secretary Jen Psaki told reporters at a daily briefing. She added that the US has been in contact with the leaders of the two countries within the past 24 hours. Psaki also noted that the US has been ""working for some time now, for months, with partners around the world to diversity natural gas supplies to Europe"". She added thatthe prisoner swapearlier today with Russia was not an indication of a larger diplomatic breakthrough. The release of American Trevor Reed ""does not change our approach"" to the war in Ukraine, Psaki said. Katya AdlerEurope Editor Iâm
told by EU diplomats involved in negotiations that an EU ban on Russian oil (most likely
a phased-out one) could be introduced next week. The European Commission says
itâs consulting with the US and the G7 group of the worldâs wealthiest nations
before making an announcement. The aim is that the blocâs oil sanctions be tough
enough to hurt Vladimir Putin but not so dramatic as to send shockwaves
through the global oil market - never mind the EUâs. Brussels says itâs aware
that countries rich and poor rely on oil. It says it wants to avoid provoking
global price hikes, which could in turn also undermine international support
for Western sanctions against Russia. Vladimir Putin (L) met AntÃ³nio Guterres in Moscow on Wednesday Fresh fromhis visit to Russia to meet Vladimir Putin,the UN Secretary General AntÃ³nio Guterres has arrived in Kyiv. He's due to hold talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Thursday. Writing on Twitter, Guterres said:,external""We will continue our work to expand humanitarian support and secure the evacuation of civilians from conflict zones.

The sooner this war ends, the better - for the sake of Ukraine, Russia, and the world."" President Zelensky said Russia sees a united Europe as a target for ""political blackmail"" Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has just delivered his nightly video message to the nation, in which he addresses what he calls Russia's ""energy blackmail"" against Europe. He says cutting off gas supplies to Poland and Bulgaria shows that ""no one in Europe can hope to maintain any normal economic cooperation with Russia"". Zelensky adds: ""Russia considers not only gas, but any trade as a weapon. It is just waiting for the moment when one or another trade area can be used."" He says Russia ""sees a united Europe as a target"" and the sooner everyone in the continent agrees that they cannot depend on Russia for trade, the sooner there will be stability. The Ukrainian president also welcomed a deal with the EU to suspend duties and quotas on Ukraine's exports, saying Russia wanted to create chaos in global markets - especially for food. Ukrainian exports would help stabilise markets and support the country's economy during the crisis, he said. Here are some pictures from today that show the devastation caused by the war, on the ground across Ukraine. In Irpin, a city near Ukraine's capital Kyiv, the House of Culture was destroyed by Russian troops. Pictured below is Mykola Nahornyi, 59, at his house, which he says was destroyed by Russian shelling on 7 March. He returned today to try to recover what remains from his belongings in Kolychivka, in the Chernihiv region in the north of Ukraine. In Kyiv, people have been attending a funeral ceremony of a Ukrainian soldier. The funeral was held in a particular area reserved for soldiers at Miske Cemetery in the capital. Also in Kyiv, people have been attending a demonstration at Independence Square in support of the south-eastern city of Mariupol. The remaining Ukrainian soldiers in the city, and some civilians, are still trapped at the Azovstal steel plant. Reality Check The Russian state-owned energy company, Gazprom, hascut off supplies to Poland and Bulgaria, and says it will not resume until payments are made in roubles. It's led to accusations that President Putin is trying to hit back economically at western countries which are supporting Ukraine against the Russian invasion. In 2019, Russia accounted for41% of the EU's natural gas imports,external. If Russian gas supplies to Europe dried up, Italy and Germany would be especially vulnerableas they import the most,external. But its also a question of how much gas a country is able to store: currently Poland's gas storage is 76% full, but Bulgaria's sits at just 17%. Bulgaria says it is looking to increase the amount of gas it receives from Azerbaijan, as well as making deals with Turkey and Greece; Poland is building a new pipeline connecting it to Norway's gas fields and looking to neighbouring Lithuania for supplies. Looking more widely, Europe could turn to existing gas exporters such Qatar, Algeria or Nigeria - but there are practical obstacles to quickly expanding production. The continent could also ramp up the use of other energy sources - such as renewables - but doing so is not quick or easy. So what happens next? Read on to find out who imports what and the steps being taken to reduce dependence on Russian energy. Paul AdamsBBC Diplomatic correspondent Western officials have been briefing on the latest in the war and they say Russia has continued to build up forces in and around the Donbas and are making minor gains. ""But when they come up against genuine military objectives, they are finding it difficult to overcome the staunch Ukrainian resistance and they are suffering losses,"" an official said. Heavy rain is also hampering Russian progress. ""Russians don't like to fight in the rain,â an official said, adding that the Russians have poor tactical awareness and continue to suffer from logistical difficulties. They have the ability to operate off road, but officials say itâs surprising that they still choose not to do so. Even in places where Ukrainian forces have found themselves encircled, they have managed to resupply their forces ""for a surprising length of time"". (Mariupol being the most obvious example). Officials noted that even in places where Russia has taken ground, Ukrainian forces have shown a âremarkableâ ability to counter-attack - sometimes doing it so fast that the Russians quickly find themselves on the back foot. Ukrainian special forces, operating behind Russian lines, are exploiting the vulnerability of long supply lines, which helps to buy time for Ukraine. If you're just joining us, earlier we brought you the news that Vladimir Putin has made a fresh threat to the West, sayingany country that sets out to intervene in Ukraine will face a ""lightning-fast""military response. ""We have all the tools for this, that no one else can boast of having... we'll use them, if needed,"" he said. ""We have already taken all the decisions on this."" His latest warning comes after Western countries have ramped up support for Ukraine in the past days. Yesterday, the US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin pledged to move ""heaven and earth"" to make sure Ukraine defeats Russia. And in recent days, there has been an increasing number of pledges to increase military support to Ukraine, including Germany's announcement that it will send 50 anti-aircraft tanks, in a sharp U-turn in policy. The UK is also expected to call later for fighter jetsto be provided to Ukraine. Earlier this week, Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov also claimed the West was âpouring oil on
the fireâ by providing Ukraine with firepower - and said the conflict could lead to World War Three. Putin's warning comes as tensions were heightened further today as Russian energy provider Gazprom cut off gas supplies to Poland and Bulgaria, saying it's because the countries refused to follow Moscow's new rule to pay for gas in roubles.

If Russian gas supplies to Europe dried up, Italy and Germany would be especially vulnerableas they import the most,external. But its also a question of how much gas a country is able to store: currently Poland's gas storage is 76% full, but Bulgaria's sits at just 17%. Bulgaria says it is looking to increase the amount of gas it receives from Azerbaijan, as well as making deals with Turkey and Greece; Poland is building a new pipeline connecting it to Norway's gas fields and looking to neighbouring Lithuania for supplies. Looking more widely, Europe could turn to existing gas exporters such Qatar, Algeria or Nigeria - but there are practical obstacles to quickly expanding production. The continent could also ramp up the use of other energy sources - such as renewables - but doing so is not quick or easy. So what happens next? Read on to find out who imports what and the steps being taken to reduce dependence on Russian energy. Paul AdamsBBC Diplomatic correspondent Western officials have been briefing on the latest in the war and they say Russia has continued to build up forces in and around the Donbas and are making minor gains. ""But when they come up against genuine military objectives, they are finding it difficult to overcome the staunch Ukrainian resistance and they are suffering losses,"" an official said. Heavy rain is also hampering Russian progress. ""Russians don't like to fight in the rain,â an official said, adding that the Russians have poor tactical awareness and continue to suffer from logistical difficulties. They have the ability to operate off road, but officials say itâs surprising that they still choose not to do so. Even in places where Ukrainian forces have found themselves encircled, they have managed to resupply their forces ""for a surprising length of time"". (Mariupol being the most obvious example). Officials noted that even in places where Russia has taken ground, Ukrainian forces have shown a âremarkableâ ability to counter-attack - sometimes doing it so fast that the Russians quickly find themselves on the back foot. Ukrainian special forces, operating behind Russian lines, are exploiting the vulnerability of long supply lines, which helps to buy time for Ukraine. If you're just joining us, earlier we brought you the news that Vladimir Putin has made a fresh threat to the West, sayingany country that sets out to intervene in Ukraine will face a ""lightning-fast""military response. ""We have all the tools for this, that no one else can boast of having... we'll use them, if needed,"" he said. ""We have already taken all the decisions on this."" His latest warning comes after Western countries have ramped up support for Ukraine in the past days. Yesterday, the US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin pledged to move ""heaven and earth"" to make sure Ukraine defeats Russia. And in recent days, there has been an increasing number of pledges to increase military support to Ukraine, including Germany's announcement that it will send 50 anti-aircraft tanks, in a sharp U-turn in policy. The UK is also expected to call later for fighter jetsto be provided to Ukraine. Earlier this week, Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov also claimed the West was âpouring oil on
the fireâ by providing Ukraine with firepower - and said the conflict could lead to World War Three. Putin's warning comes as tensions were heightened further today as Russian energy provider Gazprom cut off gas supplies to Poland and Bulgaria, saying it's because the countries refused to follow Moscow's new rule to pay for gas in roubles. If you're just joining us, here are the main developments in Ukraine today: Putin warns West and Gazprom cuts gas  Other developments Â© 2025 BBC.

Russia trying to divide allies using gas - Poland,"Ursula von der Leyen said the EU will support member states impacted by the gas freeze Russia's decision to cut off gas exports to Poland and Bulgaria is an ""instrument of blackmail"", the EU says. European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said the move showed Russia's ""unreliability"" as a supplier. But the Kremlin said Russia had been forced into the action by the ""unfriendly steps"" of Western nations. Europe depends on Russia for more than a third of its gas needs and state energy giant Gazprom holds a monopoly on pipeline supplies in Russia. While many European countries have taken steps to wean themselves of Russian oil imports since it invaded Ukraine, Russia has continued to supply large amount of gas to many European countries. After Western powers placed financial sanctions on Russia in response to its invasion, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced that ""unfriendly"" countries would have to pay for gas in Russian currency. Gazprom said this was why it had suspended supply to Bulgaria and Poland. Poland said the move was in retaliation for Polish sanctions against Russian individuals and firms. Poland has also been a key transit country for weapons to Ukraine. Bulgaria has historically had warm relations with Russia, but a new government took office last year which has denounced the invasion. Should we be worried about a gas supply crisis? President Putin meanwhile warnedthat if Western forces intervene in Ukraine, they will face a ""lightning-fast"" military response. In what is seen as a reference to ballistic missiles and nuclear arms, he told lawmakers in Moscow: ""We have all the tools no-one can boast of... we will use them if necessary."" But there are signs that Russia's offensive in Ukraine is not going as smoothly as planned, with one official saying Russian forces are having difficulties overcoming a ""staunch Ukrainian resistance"" in their offensive in the east of the country. In reaction to Gazprom's statement regarding the suspension of gas supplies to Poland and Bulgaria, Polish state gas company PGNiG confirmed that Gazprom's supplies to the country had been halted and warned that it reserved ""the right to seek compensation"". Polish President Andrzej Duda said ""appropriate legal steps"" will be taken against Gazprom, while his deputy foreign minister, Marcin Przydacz, told the BBC that Russia was seeking to ""foster divisions"" between Western allies. Bulgarian Prime Minister Kiril Petkov said the country was reviewing all of its contracts with Gazprom, including for transit of Russian gas to Serbia and Hungary, emphasising that ""one-sided blackmail was not acceptable"". Poland imports gas from Gazprom via the Yamal pipeline Bulgaria, which relies on Gazprom for more than 90% of its gas supply, said overnight it had taken steps to find alternative sources but no restrictions on gas consumption were currently required for Bulgarians. Ms von der Leyen, speaking in Brussels, said Gazprom's move was ""unjustified and unacceptable,"" but emphasised that the bloc was ""prepared for this scenario"". She added that the EU, along with its international partners, will implement an ""immediate, united and coordinated"" response. The EU leader also hit out againstreports carried by the media outlet Bloomberg,externalwhich alleged 10 European energy companies are preparing to make payments for Gazprom gas in roubles, and that four energy companies have done so already. She said such moves would be ""high risk"" for the corporations and would constitute ""a breach of our sanctions"". ""Our guidance here is very clear,"" Ms von der Leyen said. While the EU has been firm that it will not comply with Mr Putin's demands that payments be made in roubles, Hungary has reached a workaround deal with Gazprom. The countries will pay into a euro-denominated account with Gazprombank, a subsidiary of the energy giant, which in turn will deposit the amount in roubles. Russia has refused to say how many other countries have agreed to make payments in this way.

Thanks for joining us - enjoy the rest of your afternoon. Let's have a look back at how PMQs played out in the Commons...  Vicki YoungDeputy Political Editor The focus at PMQs today on the cost of living is no surprise given the local elections next week. This week, weâve heard leaks from cabinet about their plans in this area, which crucially donât cost the government any more - like less regular MOT tests. I think this helps Sir Keir
Starmer, because Labour have a policy of a windfall tax on the profits of oil
and gas companies. It means he can specifically come up with something, whilst
accusing the government of not doing enough. This is obviously a huge problem for the government, and
everyone expects it to get worse because inflation is rising. The government seems to be suggesting that although it has
already taken action on this issue, people are going to have to wait a bit longer for
something else. Of course, the point many people would make is they need the
help now. While we were watching Prime Minister's Questions, the Conservative Party has confirmed that it is investigating reports a Tory MP watched porn on his mobile phone while sitting next to a female minister in the Commons chamber. A spokeswoman said Tory chief whip Chris Heaton-Harris was ""looking into the matter"", adding: ""This behaviour is wholly unacceptable and action will be taken."" You can read the full story here. Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent With little more than a week to go to local elections, it
was hardly surprising that PMQs was dominated by attack lines from the
political parties. Incidentally, Jacob Rees Mogg spent PMQs in a vertical position behind the
Speakerâs Chair, nursing a red ringbinder. An undoubted expert in identifying empty chairs around
Westminster, he nonetheless failed to find a seat for himself today on the
front bench. Reality Check The SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford said: 
""This morning, the Trussell Trust confirmed that 830,000 children across the UK are being left to depend on emergency food parcels."" The figures he's referring to,externalcome from The Trussell Trust, which is the UK's largest network of food banks. But what they actually said was that between 1 April 2021 and 31 March 2022 ""more than 830,000 parcels were provided for children"". It is unlikely that those went to 830,000 different children - the true number of individual children receiving food parcels was probably much lower. The last question comes from Liberal Democrat Daisy Cooper. She raises the High Court rulingwhich foundgovernment policies on discharging patients from hospital to care homes in England during the pandemic was unlawful. She asks the PM to apologise to bereaved families and to the care workers ""for the comment he made when he said too many care homes didn't follow procedures"". Boris Johnson says he wants to renew his apologies and sympathies to those who lost family members. He tells MPs that the start of the pandemic was ""a difficult time"" and that ""we didn't know Covid could be transmitted asymptotically"". Labour MP Jeff Smith asks why the MP for Wakefield, Imran Ahmad Khan, was previously put on a panel advising the government on grooming. The Tory MP was convicted of sexual assaulting a teenage boy and thrown out of the Conservative party as a result. Khan denies the allegations and has said he will resign from the Commons to focus on his appeal. Smith accuses the Tories of failing to take seriously a complaint from Khan's victim. Boris Johnson says the Home Office has issued a statement about this. You can read more here. Reality Check During exchanges about the cost of living crisis, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer criticised the prime minister, saying: ""He backed a tax-hiking Budget."" But Boris Johnson responded by saying: ""Our chancellor cut taxes on working people."" The measures announced in the Spring Statement in March mean the government will collect less in income tax and National Insurance than they had previously planned. But those changes are smaller than the hikes in taxes, such as the increase in National Insurance that the chancellor had previously announced. So the Spring Statement was not a ""tax-hiking budget"", but taxes are nonetheless rising, with the overall tax burden expected to increase to the highest level since the late 1940s. You can read more about it here. Labour MP Hilary Benn says increasing numbers of people on pre-payment energy meters are disconnecting themselves because they have run out of money. He asks the PM what he is doing to make sure all people have a ""right to light and to warmth"". Boris Johnson says the government is working with energy companies to ""protect people at this difficult time"". He also points to existing government winter fuel payments to help people with costs. Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent Itâs not surprising ahead of the Northern Ireland
elections that the DUP are raising the Northern Ireland Protocol. The PM has not dampened down suggestions that domestic
legislation could be introduced to over ride the Protocol. But it will be easier
to judge the governmentâs position once the tightly fought elections are over
at the end of next week. Conservative Anthony Browne says Google and Facbeook make vast profits from advertising fraudsters. He says those companies should compensate the ""victims they helped create"". Boris Johnson says his government are looking at how they could ""make that measure work"". But he adds that it is important to ""proceed with care"". Green MP Caroline Lucas asks the PM about newspaper reports that 56 MPs have been reported to Parliament's complaints scheme for allegations of sexual harassment, including three cabinet ministers. She asks him to ""confirm"" whether sexual harassment would be considered grounds for dismissal under the ministerial rulebook, known as the ministerial code. In reply, the prime minister says sexual harassment is ""intolerable"". He adds: ""Of course it's grounds for dismissal"". The SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford associates himself with the condemnations of what he describes as ""disgusting sexism"". He then asks about the number of children across the UK who depend on food parcels - put at 830,000 by the Trussell Trust. Blackford calls on the PM to match the ""game-changing"" child payment scheme introduced by Scotland's SNP government. Boris Johnson says the government is already taking action to help ""hard-pressed families"" in a ""tough time"", and has increased council funding for this. He also says Scottish families benefit from the UK's economic union. DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson says the cost of moving goods from Britain to Northern Ireland has risen by 27% in the first year of the Northern Ireland protocol. He says the post-Brexit arrangements are ""harming our stability"". Boris Johnson says it is vital the Northern Ireland protocol commands the support of all sides. Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent The PM has thrown a spotlight on Conservative local
election tactics by denouncing a range of Labour councils as âbankruptâ. A large chunk of PMQs is resembling a shouty version of a party political broadcast on both sides of the House. In his final question, Sir Keir Starmer says the prime minister has had his âhead in the sandâ - and, having let prices spiral out of control, then âmade it worseâ by introducing tax rises. In contrast, he says Labour has a ""proper plan"" for the economy, including introducing a windfall tax on oil and gas companies and funding better insulation for homes. But in response, Boris Johnson says the Labour leader is ""doomed to be a permanent spectator"". He says Labour has ""no plan"" to protect people from social care costs, or clamp down on migrants crossing the English Channel in small boats. Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent Part of Labourâs strategy has been to portray the
Conservatives as a tax-raising party - partly as Sir Keir Starmer knows this makes
some of Boris Johnsonâs own MPs uncomfortable. But also the partyâs strategists know that eroding or eliminating
any Conservative lead on the economy will have potentially a more enduring
significance than poll leads based on discontent with the PM. Counter intuitively it is a Conservative prime minister
summoning up the spirit of NHS founder Nye Bevan to justify raising tax to fund
the health service. Sir Keir Starmer says the PM has ""only just woken up to the cost of living crisis"" and mocks a proposal to reduce the number of MOTs needed. ""It makes the cones hotline sound visionary,"" he says. The Labour leader then accuses the government of protecting the profits of North Sea oil companies while raising taxes on working people. Boris Johnson says his plans would do more for working people than Labour ""by a mile"". He points to the Â£150 council tax rebate and says taxing oil companies would ""clobber business"". The Labour leader calls the prime minister an âostrich"" putting his ""head in the sand"" over cost of living issues. Starmer also attacks the government's hike to National Insurance this April - which his party has previously called the wrong tax rise at the wrong time. Defending the government's record, the prime minister again points to a rise in the legal minimum wage. He also points to a decision to tweak National Insurance thresholds will east the burden on taxpayers. Â© 2025 BBC.

'I'm in work but I need to use a food bank',"Caroline and her daughter face a choice between heating and eating ""I'm trapped,"" says Caroline, one of the tens of thousands of people in work who have to use food banks in the UK. The classroom assistant and single mother describes it as a ""circle I can't get out of"". Over the past year, millions of food parcels have been distributed to people like Caroline, the Trussell Trust says. The charity, which runs more than half of UK food banks, says it expects food poverty to worsen in the UK as the cost of living crisis deepens. Caroline, who lives and works in County Fermanagh in rural Northern Ireland, would like to get a job with better pay, but to do that she would have to move away from her family and community. She would also like to stop claiming Universal Credit, but her budget won't allow it. As her living costs rise, she is trying to make savings, but it's hard. She puts the central heating on only occasionally and uses coal fires to keep herself and her 11-year-old daughter warm. But she needs her car for work, and the recent hikes in fuel prices have hit her hard. Her grocery bills are also rising, but in her small community there are only local convenience shops, and big supermarkets where she might find better deals are too far away. And so she sometimes finds herself falling back on food banks. Food poverty: MPs call on government to step up help Benefits and state pension increase outpaced by rising prices Universal credit cut will push workers into poverty, warns Tory former minister The Trussell Trust gave out some 1.9 million food parcels in 2019-2020, to an estimated 370,000 households. But a record 2.5 million parcels were distributed during during the height of the pandemic in 2020-21, and that only fell back to 2.1 million parcels last year. The charity is concerned that the situation is only going to get worse again as benefits fail to keep pace with inflation. The majority of people who use food banks have benefits as their only income, but a significant minority - historically about 14% - are in work. ""What we are witnessing is an accelerating crisis across the country,"" Trussell Trust boss Emma Revie tells the BBC. Tim, 36, had seasonal work at Christmas in north-west London, but has been out of a job since then. The Chelsea fan has been studying part-time but has been unable to get a job in retail, where he has previous experience. He says ""it is not an extremely good feeling"" to have to use food banks, and he feels ""slightly apprehensive and anxious"" about the cost of living crisis getting worse. His electricity bill has doubled since the energy price cap rose in April, with another rise expected later this year. A government spokesperson said: ""We recognise the pressures on the cost of living and we are doing what we can to help, including spending Â£22bn across the next financial year to support people with energy bills and cut fuel duty."" They also said it had given many workers on Universal Credit a tax cut, lifted the minimum wage and provided extra funds to councils to help the hardest hit. However, Ms Revie says the charity has been ""disappointed"" in the government's actions. In particular she criticises a decision to reverse a Â£20 a week uplift for all Universal Credit claimants last year. Ms Revie is also concerned that if energy prices continue to rise, people will be forced to choose between ""heating and eating"". ""There are health implications from not being able to stay warm, just as there are health implications of not being able to eat,"" she says. ""People need a safety net so they can bounce back, not fall into destitution."" Labour is calling for the government to set out an emergency budget to offer ""real solutions"" to the cost-of-living crisis. ""Food Banks are a symptom of economic failure and ministers must now offer real help to working people, disabled people, families and pensioners struggling to feed themselves,"" shadow work and pensions secretary Jonathan Ashworth said. For Caroline in Northern Ireland, her situation remains ""a bit of a nightmare"". She had to use all of her savings recently to get her car fixed, and she hasn't had a holiday away for five years. ""It's just like a balancing act,"" she says. ""You never know what's going to come at the other end of the scale to tip you off"".

Khan denies the allegations and has said he will resign from the Commons to focus on his appeal. Smith accuses the Tories of failing to take seriously a complaint from Khan's victim. Boris Johnson says the Home Office has issued a statement about this. You can read more here. Reality Check During exchanges about the cost of living crisis, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer criticised the prime minister, saying: ""He backed a tax-hiking Budget."" But Boris Johnson responded by saying: ""Our chancellor cut taxes on working people."" The measures announced in the Spring Statement in March mean the government will collect less in income tax and National Insurance than they had previously planned. But those changes are smaller than the hikes in taxes, such as the increase in National Insurance that the chancellor had previously announced. So the Spring Statement was not a ""tax-hiking budget"", but taxes are nonetheless rising, with the overall tax burden expected to increase to the highest level since the late 1940s. You can read more about it here. Labour MP Hilary Benn says increasing numbers of people on pre-payment energy meters are disconnecting themselves because they have run out of money. He asks the PM what he is doing to make sure all people have a ""right to light and to warmth"". Boris Johnson says the government is working with energy companies to ""protect people at this difficult time"". He also points to existing government winter fuel payments to help people with costs. Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent Itâs not surprising ahead of the Northern Ireland
elections that the DUP are raising the Northern Ireland Protocol. The PM has not dampened down suggestions that domestic
legislation could be introduced to over ride the Protocol. But it will be easier
to judge the governmentâs position once the tightly fought elections are over
at the end of next week. Conservative Anthony Browne says Google and Facbeook make vast profits from advertising fraudsters. He says those companies should compensate the ""victims they helped create"". Boris Johnson says his government are looking at how they could ""make that measure work"". But he adds that it is important to ""proceed with care"". Green MP Caroline Lucas asks the PM about newspaper reports that 56 MPs have been reported to Parliament's complaints scheme for allegations of sexual harassment, including three cabinet ministers. She asks him to ""confirm"" whether sexual harassment would be considered grounds for dismissal under the ministerial rulebook, known as the ministerial code. In reply, the prime minister says sexual harassment is ""intolerable"". He adds: ""Of course it's grounds for dismissal"". The SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford associates himself with the condemnations of what he describes as ""disgusting sexism"". He then asks about the number of children across the UK who depend on food parcels - put at 830,000 by the Trussell Trust. Blackford calls on the PM to match the ""game-changing"" child payment scheme introduced by Scotland's SNP government. Boris Johnson says the government is already taking action to help ""hard-pressed families"" in a ""tough time"", and has increased council funding for this. He also says Scottish families benefit from the UK's economic union. DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson says the cost of moving goods from Britain to Northern Ireland has risen by 27% in the first year of the Northern Ireland protocol. He says the post-Brexit arrangements are ""harming our stability"". Boris Johnson says it is vital the Northern Ireland protocol commands the support of all sides. Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent The PM has thrown a spotlight on Conservative local
election tactics by denouncing a range of Labour councils as âbankruptâ. A large chunk of PMQs is resembling a shouty version of a party political broadcast on both sides of the House. In his final question, Sir Keir Starmer says the prime minister has had his âhead in the sandâ - and, having let prices spiral out of control, then âmade it worseâ by introducing tax rises. In contrast, he says Labour has a ""proper plan"" for the economy, including introducing a windfall tax on oil and gas companies and funding better insulation for homes. But in response, Boris Johnson says the Labour leader is ""doomed to be a permanent spectator"". He says Labour has ""no plan"" to protect people from social care costs, or clamp down on migrants crossing the English Channel in small boats. Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent Part of Labourâs strategy has been to portray the
Conservatives as a tax-raising party - partly as Sir Keir Starmer knows this makes
some of Boris Johnsonâs own MPs uncomfortable. But also the partyâs strategists know that eroding or eliminating
any Conservative lead on the economy will have potentially a more enduring
significance than poll leads based on discontent with the PM. Counter intuitively it is a Conservative prime minister
summoning up the spirit of NHS founder Nye Bevan to justify raising tax to fund
the health service. Sir Keir Starmer says the PM has ""only just woken up to the cost of living crisis"" and mocks a proposal to reduce the number of MOTs needed. ""It makes the cones hotline sound visionary,"" he says. The Labour leader then accuses the government of protecting the profits of North Sea oil companies while raising taxes on working people. Boris Johnson says his plans would do more for working people than Labour ""by a mile"". He points to the Â£150 council tax rebate and says taxing oil companies would ""clobber business"". The Labour leader calls the prime minister an âostrich"" putting his ""head in the sand"" over cost of living issues. Starmer also attacks the government's hike to National Insurance this April - which his party has previously called the wrong tax rise at the wrong time. Defending the government's record, the prime minister again points to a rise in the legal minimum wage. He also points to a decision to tweak National Insurance thresholds will east the burden on taxpayers. Â© 2025 BBC.

Thanks for joining us - enjoy the rest of your afternoon. Let's have a look back at how PMQs played out in the Commons...  Vicki YoungDeputy Political Editor The focus at PMQs today on the cost of living is no surprise given the local elections next week. This week, weâve heard leaks from cabinet about their plans in this area, which crucially donât cost the government any more - like less regular MOT tests. I think this helps Sir Keir
Starmer, because Labour have a policy of a windfall tax on the profits of oil
and gas companies. It means he can specifically come up with something, whilst
accusing the government of not doing enough. This is obviously a huge problem for the government, and
everyone expects it to get worse because inflation is rising. The government seems to be suggesting that although it has
already taken action on this issue, people are going to have to wait a bit longer for
something else. Of course, the point many people would make is they need the
help now. While we were watching Prime Minister's Questions, the Conservative Party has confirmed that it is investigating reports a Tory MP watched porn on his mobile phone while sitting next to a female minister in the Commons chamber. A spokeswoman said Tory chief whip Chris Heaton-Harris was ""looking into the matter"", adding: ""This behaviour is wholly unacceptable and action will be taken."" You can read the full story here. Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent With little more than a week to go to local elections, it
was hardly surprising that PMQs was dominated by attack lines from the
political parties. Incidentally, Jacob Rees Mogg spent PMQs in a vertical position behind the
Speakerâs Chair, nursing a red ringbinder. An undoubted expert in identifying empty chairs around
Westminster, he nonetheless failed to find a seat for himself today on the
front bench. Reality Check The SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford said: 
""This morning, the Trussell Trust confirmed that 830,000 children across the UK are being left to depend on emergency food parcels."" The figures he's referring to,externalcome from The Trussell Trust, which is the UK's largest network of food banks. But what they actually said was that between 1 April 2021 and 31 March 2022 ""more than 830,000 parcels were provided for children"". It is unlikely that those went to 830,000 different children - the true number of individual children receiving food parcels was probably much lower. The last question comes from Liberal Democrat Daisy Cooper. She raises the High Court rulingwhich foundgovernment policies on discharging patients from hospital to care homes in England during the pandemic was unlawful. She asks the PM to apologise to bereaved families and to the care workers ""for the comment he made when he said too many care homes didn't follow procedures"". Boris Johnson says he wants to renew his apologies and sympathies to those who lost family members. He tells MPs that the start of the pandemic was ""a difficult time"" and that ""we didn't know Covid could be transmitted asymptotically"". Labour MP Jeff Smith asks why the MP for Wakefield, Imran Ahmad Khan, was previously put on a panel advising the government on grooming.

Thanks for joining us - enjoy the rest of your afternoon. Let's have a look back at how PMQs played out in the Commons...  Vicki YoungDeputy Political Editor The focus at PMQs today on the cost of living is no surprise given the local elections next week. This week, weâve heard leaks from cabinet about their plans in this area, which crucially donât cost the government any more - like less regular MOT tests. I think this helps Sir Keir
Starmer, because Labour have a policy of a windfall tax on the profits of oil
and gas companies. It means he can specifically come up with something, whilst
accusing the government of not doing enough. This is obviously a huge problem for the government, and
everyone expects it to get worse because inflation is rising. The government seems to be suggesting that although it has
already taken action on this issue, people are going to have to wait a bit longer for
something else. Of course, the point many people would make is they need the
help now. While we were watching Prime Minister's Questions, the Conservative Party has confirmed that it is investigating reports a Tory MP watched porn on his mobile phone while sitting next to a female minister in the Commons chamber. A spokeswoman said Tory chief whip Chris Heaton-Harris was ""looking into the matter"", adding: ""This behaviour is wholly unacceptable and action will be taken."" You can read the full story here. Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent With little more than a week to go to local elections, it
was hardly surprising that PMQs was dominated by attack lines from the
political parties. Incidentally, Jacob Rees Mogg spent PMQs in a vertical position behind the
Speakerâs Chair, nursing a red ringbinder. An undoubted expert in identifying empty chairs around
Westminster, he nonetheless failed to find a seat for himself today on the
front bench. Reality Check The SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford said: 
""This morning, the Trussell Trust confirmed that 830,000 children across the UK are being left to depend on emergency food parcels."" The figures he's referring to,externalcome from The Trussell Trust, which is the UK's largest network of food banks. But what they actually said was that between 1 April 2021 and 31 March 2022 ""more than 830,000 parcels were provided for children"". It is unlikely that those went to 830,000 different children - the true number of individual children receiving food parcels was probably much lower. The last question comes from Liberal Democrat Daisy Cooper. She raises the High Court rulingwhich foundgovernment policies on discharging patients from hospital to care homes in England during the pandemic was unlawful. She asks the PM to apologise to bereaved families and to the care workers ""for the comment he made when he said too many care homes didn't follow procedures"". Boris Johnson says he wants to renew his apologies and sympathies to those who lost family members. He tells MPs that the start of the pandemic was ""a difficult time"" and that ""we didn't know Covid could be transmitted asymptotically"". Labour MP Jeff Smith asks why the MP for Wakefield, Imran Ahmad Khan, was previously put on a panel advising the government on grooming. The Tory MP was convicted of sexual assaulting a teenage boy and thrown out of the Conservative party as a result. Khan denies the allegations and has said he will resign from the Commons to focus on his appeal. Smith accuses the Tories of failing to take seriously a complaint from Khan's victim. Boris Johnson says the Home Office has issued a statement about this. You can read more here. Reality Check During exchanges about the cost of living crisis, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer criticised the prime minister, saying: ""He backed a tax-hiking Budget."" But Boris Johnson responded by saying: ""Our chancellor cut taxes on working people."" The measures announced in the Spring Statement in March mean the government will collect less in income tax and National Insurance than they had previously planned. But those changes are smaller than the hikes in taxes, such as the increase in National Insurance that the chancellor had previously announced. So the Spring Statement was not a ""tax-hiking budget"", but taxes are nonetheless rising, with the overall tax burden expected to increase to the highest level since the late 1940s. You can read more about it here. Labour MP Hilary Benn says increasing numbers of people on pre-payment energy meters are disconnecting themselves because they have run out of money. He asks the PM what he is doing to make sure all people have a ""right to light and to warmth"". Boris Johnson says the government is working with energy companies to ""protect people at this difficult time"". He also points to existing government winter fuel payments to help people with costs. Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent Itâs not surprising ahead of the Northern Ireland
elections that the DUP are raising the Northern Ireland Protocol. The PM has not dampened down suggestions that domestic
legislation could be introduced to over ride the Protocol. But it will be easier
to judge the governmentâs position once the tightly fought elections are over
at the end of next week. Conservative Anthony Browne says Google and Facbeook make vast profits from advertising fraudsters. He says those companies should compensate the ""victims they helped create"". Boris Johnson says his government are looking at how they could ""make that measure work"". But he adds that it is important to ""proceed with care"". Green MP Caroline Lucas asks the PM about newspaper reports that 56 MPs have been reported to Parliament's complaints scheme for allegations of sexual harassment, including three cabinet ministers. She asks him to ""confirm"" whether sexual harassment would be considered grounds for dismissal under the ministerial rulebook, known as the ministerial code. In reply, the prime minister says sexual harassment is ""intolerable"". He adds: ""Of course it's grounds for dismissal"". The SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford associates himself with the condemnations of what he describes as ""disgusting sexism"". He then asks about the number of children across the UK who depend on food parcels - put at 830,000 by the Trussell Trust. Blackford calls on the PM to match the ""game-changing"" child payment scheme introduced by Scotland's SNP government. Boris Johnson says the government is already taking action to help ""hard-pressed families"" in a ""tough time"", and has increased council funding for this. He also says Scottish families benefit from the UK's economic union. DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson says the cost of moving goods from Britain to Northern Ireland has risen by 27% in the first year of the Northern Ireland protocol. He says the post-Brexit arrangements are ""harming our stability"". Boris Johnson says it is vital the Northern Ireland protocol commands the support of all sides. Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent The PM has thrown a spotlight on Conservative local
election tactics by denouncing a range of Labour councils as âbankruptâ. A large chunk of PMQs is resembling a shouty version of a party political broadcast on both sides of the House. In his final question, Sir Keir Starmer says the prime minister has had his âhead in the sandâ - and, having let prices spiral out of control, then âmade it worseâ by introducing tax rises. In contrast, he says Labour has a ""proper plan"" for the economy, including introducing a windfall tax on oil and gas companies and funding better insulation for homes. But in response, Boris Johnson says the Labour leader is ""doomed to be a permanent spectator"". He says Labour has ""no plan"" to protect people from social care costs, or clamp down on migrants crossing the English Channel in small boats. Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent Part of Labourâs strategy has been to portray the
Conservatives as a tax-raising party - partly as Sir Keir Starmer knows this makes
some of Boris Johnsonâs own MPs uncomfortable. But also the partyâs strategists know that eroding or eliminating
any Conservative lead on the economy will have potentially a more enduring
significance than poll leads based on discontent with the PM. Counter intuitively it is a Conservative prime minister
summoning up the spirit of NHS founder Nye Bevan to justify raising tax to fund
the health service. Sir Keir Starmer says the PM has ""only just woken up to the cost of living crisis"" and mocks a proposal to reduce the number of MOTs needed. ""It makes the cones hotline sound visionary,"" he says. The Labour leader then accuses the government of protecting the profits of North Sea oil companies while raising taxes on working people. Boris Johnson says his plans would do more for working people than Labour ""by a mile"". He points to the Â£150 council tax rebate and says taxing oil companies would ""clobber business"".

Defending the government's record, the prime minister again points to a rise in the legal minimum wage.

"Rural Britain ânot a museumâ, MPs and peers warnThere is a âchronic under-appreciationâ of the potential of the countryside, says a new report.","Local people in rural areas are being priced out of the market and forced to move away The rural economy is being held back by a lack of affordable housing, supermarket price-wars, poor public transport and broadband connections, according to a new report. The cross-party group of MPs and peers found the rural economy was 18% less productive than the national average. If this gap was reduced it could add Â£43bn to the UK economy. The government said it welcomed the report, and that it was providing Â£2.6bn to rural areas. The All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) on the Rural Powerhouse heard evidence from over 50 rural organisations including charities, campaign groups, academics, and business leaders. Calling it ""one of the most comprehensive inquiries into the productivity of the rural economy"" the co-chairman of the APPG, Lord Cameron of Dillington, said, ""It is vital that government understands that rural Britain is not a museum, but instead is an important part of the national economy that deserves the chance to succeed."" The parliamentary group heard evidence that there were ""systemic failings"" in the government's rural policy development and there needed to be a more ""targeted, cross-departmental, ministerial-led approach."" Mark Tufnell, president of the Country Land and Business Association, said: ""The country can no longer afford to ignore the potential of the rural economy and the prospects of the millions of people who live within it. Rural businesses are ready to expand, creating good jobs and opportunities for people from all walks of life - but a lack of interest from government is holding them back."" The wide-ranging report highlighted many factors including the planning system, saying it was ""failing those living and working in the countryside"". With Covid leading to more people relocating from cities, the report said that prices were being pushed up and that in Cornwall, for example, houses were now nine times the average wage in England. The definition of ""affordable housing"" was misleading, according to the report, with new homes often out of reach for local people and small-scale housing developments ""routinely rejected"". Ensuring housing was within the reach of local people would allow them to live where they worked, the report said, keeping money in the community. The report called for the National Planning Policy Framework to ""refer to the need for economic growth in rural areas."" Developments with under 3,000 inhabitants should be favoured, with an emphasis placed on affordable housing. The report said that poor public transport and urban-centric policymaking was reducing the opportunities for young people and leading to a 'brain drain'. It called on the government to provide focussed support, including ring-fencing funding for rural communities. The report also said that Brexit and Covid-19 have had an impact on supply chains and access to foreign labour, and that trade deals were also putting UK farming standards at risk. It called for the influence of major supermarkets to be limited, and the Seasonal Workers Pilot scheme to be broadened, extending the number of visas offered from 30,000 to 80,000. For those in remote areas with poor broadband, lockdown meant more difficulties for those working from home and and home-schooling The report also highlighted the importance of improving poor digital infrastructure in rural areas. It cited a study showing that only 46% of rural areas had good 4G and said that services were harder to access, and fewer businesses were choosing to relocate to the countryside. The report also said the tax system should be adapted to encourage regenerative development. In response, Rural Affairs Minister, Richard Benyon, said: ""We welcome this report and its recommendations. Rural areas are at the heart of our vision for levelling up; I want businesses and people in remote areas to do as well as those in inner cities. ""We are providing funding to put in place the infrastructure that rural areas need, and the public services and opportunities that they deserve. We have already announced over Â£2.6 billion via the UK Shared Prosperity Fund, and we will be saying more about rural funding shortly.""

Russia accused of blackmail after halting gas supplyRussian energy giant Gazprom cuts supply to Poland and Bulgaria for refusal to pay in roubles.,"Ursula von der Leyen said the EU will support member states impacted by the gas freeze Russia's decision to cut off gas exports to Poland and Bulgaria is an ""instrument of blackmail"", the EU says. European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said the move showed Russia's ""unreliability"" as a supplier. But the Kremlin said Russia had been forced into the action by the ""unfriendly steps"" of Western nations. Europe depends on Russia for more than a third of its gas needs and state energy giant Gazprom holds a monopoly on pipeline supplies in Russia. While many European countries have taken steps to wean themselves of Russian oil imports since it invaded Ukraine, Russia has continued to supply large amount of gas to many European countries. After Western powers placed financial sanctions on Russia in response to its invasion, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced that ""unfriendly"" countries would have to pay for gas in Russian currency. Gazprom said this was why it had suspended supply to Bulgaria and Poland. Poland said the move was in retaliation for Polish sanctions against Russian individuals and firms. Poland has also been a key transit country for weapons to Ukraine. Bulgaria has historically had warm relations with Russia, but a new government took office last year which has denounced the invasion. Should we be worried about a gas supply crisis? President Putin meanwhile warnedthat if Western forces intervene in Ukraine, they will face a ""lightning-fast"" military response. In what is seen as a reference to ballistic missiles and nuclear arms, he told lawmakers in Moscow: ""We have all the tools no-one can boast of... we will use them if necessary."" But there are signs that Russia's offensive in Ukraine is not going as smoothly as planned, with one official saying Russian forces are having difficulties overcoming a ""staunch Ukrainian resistance"" in their offensive in the east of the country. In reaction to Gazprom's statement regarding the suspension of gas supplies to Poland and Bulgaria, Polish state gas company PGNiG confirmed that Gazprom's supplies to the country had been halted and warned that it reserved ""the right to seek compensation"". Polish President Andrzej Duda said ""appropriate legal steps"" will be taken against Gazprom, while his deputy foreign minister, Marcin Przydacz, told the BBC that Russia was seeking to ""foster divisions"" between Western allies. Bulgarian Prime Minister Kiril Petkov said the country was reviewing all of its contracts with Gazprom, including for transit of Russian gas to Serbia and Hungary, emphasising that ""one-sided blackmail was not acceptable"". Poland imports gas from Gazprom via the Yamal pipeline Bulgaria, which relies on Gazprom for more than 90% of its gas supply, said overnight it had taken steps to find alternative sources but no restrictions on gas consumption were currently required for Bulgarians. Ms von der Leyen, speaking in Brussels, said Gazprom's move was ""unjustified and unacceptable,"" but emphasised that the bloc was ""prepared for this scenario"". She added that the EU, along with its international partners, will implement an ""immediate, united and coordinated"" response. The EU leader also hit out againstreports carried by the media outlet Bloomberg,externalwhich alleged 10 European energy companies are preparing to make payments for Gazprom gas in roubles, and that four energy companies have done so already. She said such moves would be ""high risk"" for the corporations and would constitute ""a breach of our sanctions"". ""Our guidance here is very clear,"" Ms von der Leyen said. While the EU has been firm that it will not comply with Mr Putin's demands that payments be made in roubles, Hungary has reached a workaround deal with Gazprom. The countries will pay into a euro-denominated account with Gazprombank, a subsidiary of the energy giant, which in turn will deposit the amount in roubles. Russia has refused to say how many other countries have agreed to make payments in this way.

The EU leader also hit out againstreports carried by the media outlet Bloomberg,externalwhich alleged 10 European energy companies are preparing to make payments for Gazprom gas in roubles, and that four energy companies have done so already. She said such moves would be ""high risk"" for the corporations and would constitute ""a breach of our sanctions"". ""Our guidance here is very clear,"" Ms von der Leyen said. While the EU has been firm that it will not comply with Mr Putin's demands that payments be made in roubles, Hungary has reached a workaround deal with Gazprom. The countries will pay into a euro-denominated account with Gazprombank, a subsidiary of the energy giant, which in turn will deposit the amount in roubles. Russia has refused to say how many other countries have agreed to make payments in this way.

Athlete search officers face misconduct hearing,"This video can not be played Footage of the stop was shared widely on Twitter, after being posted by former Olympic 100m champion Linford Christie Five Metropolitan Police officers will face a gross-misconduct hearing over the stop-and-search of Team GB athlete Bianca Williams, following an investigation by the police watchdog. The British sprinter, 28, and her partner, were stopped in their car, in west London, in July 2020. The couple were handcuffed, searched for weapons and drugs and separated from their three-month-old son. An independent panel will now determine whether to uphold the allegations. The Metropolitan Police referred itself to the Independent Office of Police Conduct (IOPC) after footage of the stop-and-search was posted online by former Olympic champion sprinter Linford Christie, who trains Ms Williams and her partner, Portuguese sprinter Ricardo dos Santos. The couple believe they were racially profiled and stopped because they are black. Ms Williams, a Commonwealth Games gold medallist, said the decision to hold a hearing ""opens the door for the Met to start being more honest and reflective about the culture of racism which is undoubtedly still a reality within the organisation"". Bianca Williams believes she was racially profiled Publishing the findings of the IOPC investigation, on Wednesday, regional director Sal Naseem said all five officers - an acting sergeant and four constables - would face allegations they had breached police standards of professional behaviour for duties and responsibilities and for equality and diversity. Four officers also face allegations they breached the standards for use of force and for authority, respect and courtesy. Three of the constables will face allegations they breached the standards for honesty and integrity and one will face an allegation they breached the police standards of professional behaviour for orders and instructions. A sixth officer will attend a misconduct meeting related to the stop-and-search. If a police officer is found guilty of gross misconduct, disciplinary action can include being sacked, demoted or receiving a written warning. Met Police Deputy Assistant Commissioner Bas Javid said sorry for the ""distress that this incident clearly caused Ms Williams and Mr Dos Santos"" - repeating an apology made by the force three days after the search. ""We have co-operated fully with the IOPC's investigation and, in accordance with their direction, are now arranging for an independently led misconduct hearing to take place,"" he added. London Mayor Sadiq Khan welcomed the IOPC's findings and called for the hearing to be as soon as possible. ""This case is yet another example of why it is vital that the next [Met Police] commissioner has a more effective plan to tackle the serious cultural issues within the Met Police and to regain the trust of Londoners,"" he said. Ms Williams and her partner, Portuguese sprinter Ricardo dos Santos, welcomed news of the gross-misconduct hearing Dame Cressida Dick quit as Met Police commissioner in February, when Mr Khan said he had lost confidence in her leadership. A few weeks after the stop-and-search of Ms Williams and Mr Dos Santos, Dame Cressida had told LBC radio she did not ""personally accept"" the video footage ""reveals racism"". Ms Williams said Dame Cressida had made ""public efforts to discredit and undermine our complaints and to trivialise the experiences of black people in the UK and how we are policed"". ""I sincerely hope that the Met's culture of sweeping these issues under the carpet ends with the former commissioner,"" she added. Met Police chief Cressida Dick to step down The crises and controversies of Cressida Dick The IOPC said the Met should consider apologising for comments made shortly after the search by Dame Cressida's Deputy Commissioner at the time, Sir Stephen House. In July 2020, he told the London Assembly Police and Crime Committee internal reviews of the footage had not highlighted ""anything wrong"" with the officers' conduct. In response, a Met official said on Wednesday: ""Sir Stephen stands by his statement as being factually correct at the time and has written to the IOPC to reinforce the importance of senior officers being able to respond to questions from our scrutiny bodies openly and transparently and for advice and clarification of the IOPC's view of how he and his fellow chief officers, both in the Met and nationally, should respond to similar direct questioning in future.""

Kellogg's takes government to court over food rules,"Food giant Kellogg's is taking the government to court over new rules that would prevent some cereals being prominently displayed in stores because of their high sugar content. Kellogg's says the rules fail to consider the nutritional value of the milk added to the product. The company says independent market data shows cereals are eaten with milk or yoghurt in 92% of cases. But the government said the new rules would help tackle childhood obesity. Under the new regulations for England,external, which come into force from October, retailer promotions on food and drink high in fat, salt or sugar will be restricted. Products covered by the restrictions will also not be allowed to be featured in key locations such as checkouts, store entrances, aisle ends and their online equivalents. Popular brands such as Crunchy Nut Corn Flakes and Fruit and Fibre are classified as foods that are high in fat, sugar or salt in their dry form and so retailers may be prevented from displaying such products in prominent positions, harming sales. Including added milk would change the calculation by reducing the proportion of sugar and salt content relative to the weight of the overall serving. How bad is our obesity problem? Junk food TV adverts to be banned before 9pm Sugar reduction in food well below target of 20% In a statement, Kellogg's said it had ""tried to have a reasonable conversation with government"" over the issue without success - hence their legal challenge. Chris Silcock, Kellogg's UK Managing Director, said: ""We believe the formula being used by the government to measure the nutritional value of breakfast cereals is wrong and not implemented legally. It measures cereals dry when they are almost always eaten with milk. ""All of this matters because, unless you take account of the nutritional elements added when cereal is eaten with milk, the full nutritional value of the meal is not measured."" However, some food campaigners disagreed. Caroline Cerny, from the Obesity Health Alliance, said: ""This is a blatant attempt by a multinational food company to wriggle out of vital new regulations that will limit their ability to profit from marketing their unhealthy products. ""It's shocking that a company like Kellogg's would sue the government over its plans to help people be healthier rather than investing in removing sugar from their cereals."" A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: ""Breakfast cereals contribute 7% - a significant amount - to the average daily free sugar intakes of children. ""Restricting the promotion and advertising of less healthy foods is an important part of the cross-government strategy to halve childhood obesity by 2030, prevent harmful diseases and improve healthy life expectancy, so we can continue to level up health across the nation."" The BBC understands the government is determined to fight Kellogg's legal case as it might allow other producers to suggest ways their products' fat, sugar and salt content could be reduced if served with other ingredients, in a way it feels could undermine the new regulations. A hearing on the issue begins later at the Royal Courts of Justice in London. How bad is our obesity problem?

Russia halts gas exports to Poland and Bulgaria,"Poland imports gas from Gazprom via the Yamal pipeline Russian energy giant Gazprom says it has halted gas exports to Poland and Bulgaria over the countries' refusal to pay for supplies in roubles. The firm said services will not be restored until payments are made in the Russian currency. It comes after Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered ""unfriendly"" countries to pay for gas in roubles. Poland confirmed supplies had stopped, but Bulgaria said it was still unclear whether supplies had been halted. Countries pay in advance for their gas, but as they have gone to pay for future supplies, Russia has stood firm on itsdemand made last month that new purchases need to be paid in roubles. The threat, in which Mr Putin said ""existing contracts will be stopped"", has been seen as an attempt boost the rouble, which has been hit by Western sanctions. Nathan Piper, head of oil and gas research at Investec, told the BBC the halting of supplies to Poland and Bulgaria was the ""start of Russia exerting economic pressure on Europe,"" and a move which could ""escalate"" with other EU nations. Poland's deputy foreign minister said the country could cope without Gazprom's gas and had ""taken some decisions many years ago to prepare for such a situation"". Marcin Przdacz told the BBC there were ""options to get the gas from other partners,"" including the US and gulf nations. ""I'm pretty sure that we will manage to handle this,"" he told the BBC. Could the world cope without Russian oil and gas? Germany rules out immediate ban on Russian oil Polish state gas company PGNiG, which bought 53% of its gas imports from Gazprom in the first quarter of this year, described the suspension as a breach of contract, adding that the company would take steps to reinstate the gas supply. Meanwhile in Sofia, energy minister Alexander Nikolov said Bulgaria had paid for Russian gas deliveries for April and claimed supplier Gazprom will be in breach of its current contract if it halts the flow. ""Because all trade and legal obligations are being observed, it is clear that at the moment [Russian] natural gas is being used more as a political and economic weapon in the current war,"" Mr Nikolov said. Bulgaria, which relies on Gazprom for more than 90% of its gas supply, said it had taken steps to find alternative sources but no restrictions on gas consumption were currently required. The executive director of Bulgarian gas network operator Bulgartransgaz said supplies to Bulgaria were still currently flowing. Bulgaria also transports Russian gas via an extension of the Turk Stream pipeline to neighbouring Serbia and from there to Hungary. Hungary and Austria also said gas supplies were normal. The Prime Minister of the Czech Republic, Petr Fiala, said the country has had no signals or information on any interruption to its gas supplies, but must be prepared for any scenario. The central European country is almost entirely dependent on Russia for its gas. Russia's top lawmaker, Vyacheslav Volodin, said that gas giant Gazprom had made the right decision in suspending gas supplies to Bulgaria and Poland and said Moscow should do the same with other ""unfriendly"" countries. Meanwhile, Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, said Russia was using gas ""as an instrument of blackmail"". Ms von der Leyen said the EU was ""prepared for this scenario"" and had been ""working to ensure alternative deliveries and the best possible storage levels across the EU"". Investec's Mr Piper told the BBC the halting of supplies to Poland and Bulgaria was the ""start of Russia exerting economic pressure on Europe."" He said despite demand for gas declining as Europe enters summer, ""risks around Russian gas supply are keeping prices high, putting pressure on consumers and industry"". The latest move by Russia sent European gas prices up further on Wednesday, surging by 24%. Mr Putin's decree for gas payments means foreign buyers of Russian gas have to open an account at Russia's Gazprombank and transfer euros or US dollars into it. Gazprombank would then convert this into roubles which will then be used to make the payment for gas. This move is designed as a Kremlin shot across the bows of Europe's biggest economies. While Germany, for example, has said it is willing to phase out Russian coal in the summer, and hinted Russian oil could follow over the next year, gas is another matter. Last week Germany's finance minister told me it would be physically impossible to immediately phase out Germany's 45% dependence on Russia for gas. Both Poland and Bulgaria were already planning not to renew their contract with Gazprom which expires at the end of the year. In the case of Poland, it had been filling its stores of gas in preparation. The escalation is real, and justified by the Kremlin on the basis of countries refusing to pay for gas by changing money into roubles in Russian bank accounts. But the additional impact of Wednesday's news should be containable. All that would change, of course, if these moves are the first skirmishes in an escalating European energy crisis that could see Germany cut off from Russian gas. That would send prices spiralling across Europe and lead to a supply crisis. UK Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab earlier told Sky News the decision to cut off gas supplies will have ""a very damaging effect on Russia,"" adding that such moves could lead to the country becoming ""an economic pariah"". Following Russia's announcement, Poland's climate ministry said the country's energy supplies were secure. Climate Minister Anna Moskwa said there was no need to draw gas from reserves and gas to customers would not be cut. Poland was already planning to stop importing Russian gas by the end of the year, when its long-term supply contract with Gazprom expires. PGNiG said its underground gas storage was almost 80% full and it also has alternative supply sources, including a liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal in Swinoujscie. On 1 May, a new gas pipeline connection with Lithuania is due to open that will give Poland access to gas from Lithuania's LNG terminal. And a new pipeline delivering gas from Norway, known as the ""Baltic Pipe"", comes online in October. It should reach full capacity by the end of the year and could replace all Russian deliveries. Supplies from Russia account for about 40% of the EU's natural gas imports. However, many countries have pledged to move away from Russian energy in response to its invasion of Ukraine. The US has declared a complete ban on Russian oil, gas and coal imports. Meanwhile, the UK is to phase out Russian oil by the end of the year, with gas to follow as soon as possible, and the EU is reducing gas imports by two-thirds.

"Rural Britain ânot a museumâ, MPs and peers warn","Local people in rural areas are being priced out of the market and forced to move away The rural economy is being held back by a lack of affordable housing, supermarket price-wars, poor public transport and broadband connections, according to a new report. The cross-party group of MPs and peers found the rural economy was 18% less productive than the national average. If this gap was reduced it could add Â£43bn to the UK economy. The government said it welcomed the report, and that it was providing Â£2.6bn to rural areas. The All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) on the Rural Powerhouse heard evidence from over 50 rural organisations including charities, campaign groups, academics, and business leaders. Calling it ""one of the most comprehensive inquiries into the productivity of the rural economy"" the co-chairman of the APPG, Lord Cameron of Dillington, said, ""It is vital that government understands that rural Britain is not a museum, but instead is an important part of the national economy that deserves the chance to succeed."" The parliamentary group heard evidence that there were ""systemic failings"" in the government's rural policy development and there needed to be a more ""targeted, cross-departmental, ministerial-led approach."" Mark Tufnell, president of the Country Land and Business Association, said: ""The country can no longer afford to ignore the potential of the rural economy and the prospects of the millions of people who live within it. Rural businesses are ready to expand, creating good jobs and opportunities for people from all walks of life - but a lack of interest from government is holding them back."" The wide-ranging report highlighted many factors including the planning system, saying it was ""failing those living and working in the countryside"". With Covid leading to more people relocating from cities, the report said that prices were being pushed up and that in Cornwall, for example, houses were now nine times the average wage in England. The definition of ""affordable housing"" was misleading, according to the report, with new homes often out of reach for local people and small-scale housing developments ""routinely rejected"". Ensuring housing was within the reach of local people would allow them to live where they worked, the report said, keeping money in the community. The report called for the National Planning Policy Framework to ""refer to the need for economic growth in rural areas."" Developments with under 3,000 inhabitants should be favoured, with an emphasis placed on affordable housing. The report said that poor public transport and urban-centric policymaking was reducing the opportunities for young people and leading to a 'brain drain'. It called on the government to provide focussed support, including ring-fencing funding for rural communities. The report also said that Brexit and Covid-19 have had an impact on supply chains and access to foreign labour, and that trade deals were also putting UK farming standards at risk. It called for the influence of major supermarkets to be limited, and the Seasonal Workers Pilot scheme to be broadened, extending the number of visas offered from 30,000 to 80,000. For those in remote areas with poor broadband, lockdown meant more difficulties for those working from home and and home-schooling The report also highlighted the importance of improving poor digital infrastructure in rural areas. It cited a study showing that only 46% of rural areas had good 4G and said that services were harder to access, and fewer businesses were choosing to relocate to the countryside. The report also said the tax system should be adapted to encourage regenerative development. In response, Rural Affairs Minister, Richard Benyon, said: ""We welcome this report and its recommendations. Rural areas are at the heart of our vision for levelling up; I want businesses and people in remote areas to do as well as those in inner cities. ""We are providing funding to put in place the infrastructure that rural areas need, and the public services and opportunities that they deserve. We have already announced over Â£2.6 billion via the UK Shared Prosperity Fund, and we will be saying more about rural funding shortly.""

First P&O ferry crosses Channel since sackings,"P&O Ferries has been urged to hand back the money it received to furlough staff during the coronavirus pandemic. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said the firm should repay the Â£11m in government money it had received. The ferry firm sparked outrage after sacking almost 800 seafarers and replacing them with cheaper agency workers paid below the minimum wage. Mr Shapps' comments came as P&O Ferries resumed cross-Channel sailings for the first time since the sackings. On Tuesday, the Spirit Of Britain was the first P&O vessel to resume sailings on the Dover-Calais route, after being detained for nearly a fortnight by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency over safety concerns. The vessel was carrying freight customers only, with passenger services expected to start again early next week. It is the only P&O ship back in service on the Dover to Calais route, with three others still waiting to pass inspections. It came afteranother P&O ship spent hours adriftwithout power in the Irish Sea. P&O said the incident was caused by a ""temporary mechanical issue"" that had been resolved. The ship - which will now be visited by maritime inspectors - returned to port ""under its own propulsion, with local tugs on standby,"" a spokesperson added. Dover to Calais P&O ferry cleared to sail P&O Ferries hits back at new staff pay cut claim Mr Shapps also reiterated his call for P&O Ferries boss Peter Hebblethwaite to resign saying his position was ""completely unsustainable"". ""He will have to go,"" he added. Mr Shapps also said said the government will introduce new legislation aimed at forcing ferry firms which use UK ports to pay the UK minimum wage. The new P&O Ferries crew are paid an average of just Â£5.50 per hour. This is below the UK's national minimum wage of Â£9.50 per hour, but in line with international maritime law. In response to criticism from Mr Shapps, a spokesman for P&O Ferries said: ""The actions our company took on 17 March, while unpopular, saved 2,200 jobs and a British company."" The spokesman called on the government to have a ""constructive dialogue"" about the ""future"" after two ""very difficult years for business"". ""Calls for our chief executive to go need to stop,"" the spokesman added. ""Despite the attempts from some parties to undermine our business by creating false rumours and uninformed commentary, our morale is high and our spirit as a company is strong."" P&O Ferries also said it will be back to full service ""shortly"" and will return to commercial viability ""soon"". Responding to Grant Shapps's comments, National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers (RMT) general secretary Mick Lynch, said Mr Shapps was ""in fact, trying to rehabilitate the embattled ferry company"". ""The transport secretary is avoiding his responsibilities by not impounding P&O vessels, reinstating staff on union contracts and getting the government to take over the running of the company"". ""Only then will be able to have safely staffed vessels with decent pay and conditions which the public can feel confident in using,"" Mr Lynch added. On Monday, Pat Rafferty, Scottish Trades Union Congress (STUC) president, said the way the seafarers were sacked was ""inhumane"". ""Peter Hebblethwaite should be struck off the directors register and put behind bars,"" Mr Rafferty told an annual conference in Aberdeen. ""That would send a clear message to employers, act irresponsibly towards workers and face the possibility that you will be jailed."" The BBC has contacted P&O Ferries for a response. Mr Hebblethwaite previously said he had not taken a cut to his Â£325,000 salary, after criticism for replacing his staff with agency workers who receive less than minimum wage. The Maritime and Coastguard Agency has decided to request a further inspection of the European Causeway following its mechanical failure at sea. PM thinks P&O broke the law over 800 sackings.
