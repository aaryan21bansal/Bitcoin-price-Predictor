Northern children 'too often left behind'The children's commissioner says those from poorer homes face an education gap which grows over time.6m7 minutes agoFamily & Education,"The government says its Northern Powerhouse programme is investing billions to boost local economies Too many children growing up in the north of England are facing the double disadvantage of entrenched deprivation and poor schools, a report warns. England's Children's Commissioner Anne Longfield says children from poorer homes face an education gap that starts before school and widens over time. She calls for greater investment for struggling families and a scheme to boost teacher recruitment in the North. The government says it has committed Â£70m to improve schools in the region. The commissioners' report - Growing Up North, Look North: A generation of children await the powerhouse promise - is based on 12 months of research and conversations with children, schools, businesses, councils, health professionals and charities. It says that while many children growing up in the North are thriving, there are huge gaps between the poorest children in the North and the poorest in London. It says a child on free school meals (FSM) living in Hackney, east London, is three times more likely to go to university than a child on FSM from Hartlepool. And London children on FSM are 40% more likely to achieve a good maths and English GSCE than children in the North. Is there a north-south divide in schools? Osborne urges action on north-south divide The commissioner's research also finds: too many children start school far behind where they should be, often with special educational needs that have not been picked up more than half of the secondary schools serving the North's most deprived communities are judged to be less than good large numbers of children drop out of education before they reach the age of 18 there is a lack of confidence among children that economic regeneration will mean more jobs or opportunities Ms Longfield is urging the government to inject more investment into the most disadvantaged areas of northern England to support children and family hubs to help families who are struggling. She also calling for a northern schools programme to boost teacher recruitment and new partnerships between employers and schools to broaden horizons. Three young people from Elliott Hudson College in Leeds told the BBC that, while they were confident about their own individual futures, there were barriers for a lot of young people in the North. ""There's way more opportunities and a lot more investment down south than there is up north,"" said Hafsah. ""Maybe in the future they might bring it up north, but right now it's definitely down south, concentrated down south. This video can not be played How Northern students see North-South education gap ""It's really frustrating to be honest because everyone deserves equal opportunities, especially because in our country that is, like, supposed to be the main focus. ""It seems like if you're from London and a deprived area, you know you'd get a good education, regardless. Whereas if you're up North and you live in a deprived area - well you're practically living in that cycle. ""For you it's like you're deprived, your kids might be deprived unless one of you decides to up your game and walk out.  But it's not fair."" Tiseana said money issues were also a barrier for a lot of youngsters. ""A lot of people I know went for the apprenticeship route because they get money and they didn't want to go to university because of the debt. I think that's a big problem. ""So I think that if you have a lot of money and you can pay for your university fees straightway then it's a lot easier for you."" Qasim added: ""If you have more money, you have better opportunities to get the best and if you have quite a bit of money you can even pay for your own education. Qasim says money plays a big part in opportunity ""If you have more money, it does lead to more doors being opened for you. ""Some of us may have part-time jobs, but if your parents have a lot more money than other parents would do, then you won't have to get a part-time job so you can focus more on education, rather having a part-time job and having to pay for stuff."" Ms Longfield said that disadvantage manifested itself in childhood in many ways, including ""a lack of confidence, uncertainty and low expectation, isolated communities with narrow and poor job prospects, poor school results and poor connections to further and higher education"". She added: ""Children in some areas look at new developments in the north but have little hope they might feel the benefits or have increased choices in life as a result. ""There are 3.6 million children growing up in the north. Every one of them should have the brightest future possible and best opportunities to look forward to happy, healthy and prosperous lives. ""Where they live and grow up should not be a barrier to making the most of their lives."" The Children's Commissioner wants more investment in the north of England Sir John Townsley, chief executive of The Gorse Academies Trust which runs 10 schools in Leeds, said the eyes of central government were not on the North. ""The great interest from government remains in the south and south-east. We're barely visited, no-one's particularly interested in what we do."" Sir John said children from disadvantaged backgrounds needed high expectations of them, alongside a high quality education. ""We still have many young people who in their primary schools, in their secondary schools, are not in very strong schools and they themselves come from lives that are characterised by deprivation. ""So they suffer that double disadvantage that means it's incredibly difficult for them to move forward effectively on to rigorous programmes of study, success in A-levels, success in degrees, success in higher level apprenticeships. ""Far too many people from disadvantaged backgrounds are not really put into a position where they are challenged to a truly rigorous and dynamic academic education. ""The greatest gift that we can give to a child who has very little is not to make excuses, not to seek reasons to have them avoid doing very difficult things, but actually to make them challenged more than anyone else in any of our schools."" The Department for Education said five of the 12 disadvantaged areas selected as ""Opportunity Areas"" to receive government funding are in the north. Since 2010, there are now 1.9 million more children in England in good or outstanding schools, it added. A government spokesman said: ""We want to create a country where everyone gets the best start in life, no matter what their background is or where they live. ""As the children's commissioner notes, many children in the north are now thriving, but there is more to do. ""Our Northern Powerhouse programme includes Â£3.4bn investment in projects to boost the local economy, Â£12m to spread good teaching practice in English and improve early literacy, and schemes that help families to support their child's education at home."" The government has also committed Â£70m to boost school performance in the north as part of the Northern Powerhouse Schools Strategy. Shadow education secretary Angela Rayner said: ""Where a child is born should not determine their life chances. ""By slashing funding for local services, introducing the first cuts to school budgets in a generation and denying the north the level of investment that some areas in the south can take for granted, the Tories are holding back children in the north of England"" Is there a north-south divide in schools?

Facebook boss apologises in newspaper ads,"""I'm sorry we didn't do more at the time,"" Mr Zuckerberg said Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg has taken out full-page adverts in several UK and US Sunday newspapers to apologise for the firm's recent data privacy scandal. He said Facebook could have done more to stop millions of users having their data exploited by political consultancy Cambridge Analytica in 2014. ""This was a breach of trust, and I am sorry,"" the back-page ads state. It comes amid reports Facebook was warned its data protection policies were too weak back in 2011. The full-page apology featured in broadsheets and tabloids in the UK, appearing on the back page of the Sunday Telegraph, Sunday Times, Mail on Sunday, Observer, Sunday Mirror and Sunday Express. In the US, it was seen by readers of the New York Times, Washington Post and Wall Street Journal. Facebook's Zuckerberg speaks out over Cambridge Analytica 'breach' Facebook boss summoned over data claims In the advert, Mr Zuckerberg said a quiz developed by a university researcher had ""leaked Facebook data of millions of people in 2014"". The ad appeared in papers such as the Sunday Telegraph and New York Times ""I'm sorry we didn't do more at the time. We're now taking steps to make sure this doesn't happen again,"" the tech chief said. It echoes comments Mr Zuckerberg made last week after reports of the leak prompted investigations in Europe and the US, and knockedbillions of dollars of Facebook's market value. Mr Zuckerberg repeated that Facebook had already changed its rules so no such breach could happen again. ""We're also investigating every single app that had access to large amounts of data before we fixed this. We expect there are others,"" he stated. ""And when we find them, we will ban them and tell everyone affected."" The ads contained no mention of the political consultancy accused of using the leaked data, Cambridge Analytica, which worked on US President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign. The British firm has denied wrongdoing. In 2014, Facebook invited users to find out their personality type via a quiz developed by Cambridge University researcher, Dr Alexsandr Kogan called This is Your Digital Life. About 270,000 users' data was collected, but the app also collected some public data from users' friends without their knowledge. Facebook has since changed the amount of data developers can gather in this way, but a whistleblower, Christopher Wylie, says the data of about 50 million people was harvested for Cambridge Analytica before the rules on user consent were tightened up. Mr Wylie claims the data was sold to Cambridge Analytica which then used it to psychologically profile people and deliver pro-Trump material to them during the 2016 US presidential election campaign. Facebook has said Dr Kogan passed this information on to Cambridge Analytica without its knowledge. And Cambridge Analytica has blamed Dr Kogan for any potential breach of data rules. But Dr Kogan has said he was told by Cambridge Analytica everything they had done was legal, and that he was being made a ""scapegoat"" by the firm and Facebook. As firstreported in the Sunday Telegraph,,externalIreland's Data Protection Commissioner (DPC) warned Facebook's security policies were too weak to stop abuse in 2011, some three years before the breach took place. Following an audit, the DPC said relying on developers to follow information rules in some cases was not good enough ""to ensure security of user data"". It also said Facebook processes to stop abuse were not strong enough to ""assure users of the security of their data once they have third party apps enabled"". Facebook said it strengthened its protections following the recommendations and was told it had addressed the DPC's original concerns aftera second audit,externalin 2012. The tech firm also said it changed its platform entirely in 2014 with the regulator's recommendations in mind. Zuckerberg speaks out on data breaches Cambridge Analytica: What we know so far.

Cricketers fined over ball-tampering,"Steve Smith (right) will miss the fourth Test against South Africa while the ICC says it hopes Cameron Bancroft (left) has learned from his mistake Australia captain Steve Smith has been banned for one match and fined his entire match fee by cricket's world governing body for his part in a ball-tampering incident in South Africa. Smith saidthe team's ""leadership group"" had a plan, carried out by Cameron Bancroft, to tamper with the ball to ""get an advantage"". Smith, 28, will now miss the fourth and final Test of the series. Bancroft, 25, was fined 75% of his match fee and got three demerit points. Smith admitted a charge of conduct ""of a serious nature that is contrary to the spirit of the game"",said a statement,externalfrom the International Cricket Council (ICC). ""As captain, Steve Smith must take full responsibility for the actions of his players and it is appropriate that he be suspended,"" said ICC chief executive David Richardson. Hours later, the Australians lost 10 wickets in the final session of day four to lose the third Test by 322 runs. Chasing a target of 430, they reached 47-0 at tea but were all out for 107. Smith had made one when he top-edged Kagiso Rabada for six, but soon departed for seven. South Africa fast bowler Morne Morkel, who willretire from international cricketat the end of the series, took the final wicket to finish with 5-23 as the hosts took a 2-1 series lead. The final match of the ill-tempered series begins in Johannesburg on Friday. 'Are Australia out of control?' The key questions after ball-tampering shame Drying it, cleaning it, even smelling it... five memorable ball-tampering controversies This video can not be played Australia ball-tampering: I don't remember ever being as disappointed - Jim Maxwell The ball-tampering incident took place on the third day in Cape Town - escalating the tension around what has been an ill-tempered series. Television footage showed Bancroft take what he said was yellow tape out of his trouser pocket before rubbing the ball. Smith said after play it was a ""big mistake"" but that he would not stand down. Cricket Australia (CA) has begun an investigation into the actions of its team, which Australia's prime minister Malcolm Turnbull said had ""shocked and bitterly disappointed"" him. ""The game needs to have a hard look at itself,"" added ICC chief Richardson. ""The ICC needs to do more to prevent poor behaviour and better police the spirit of the game, defining more clearly what is expected of players and enforcing the regulations in a consistent fashion. ""In addition, and most importantly, member countries need to show more accountability for their teams' conduct. ""Winning is important but not at the expense of the spirit of the game which is intrinsic and precious to the sport of cricket. We have to raise the bar across all areas."" Former England batsman Kevin Pietersen gives his view on the positions of Australia coach Darren Lehmann and his assistant David Saker Batsman Bancroft admitted ""changing the condition of the ball in breach of clause 41.3"" and accepted his punishment from Andy Pycroft, who is on the elite panel of ICC match referees. ""To carry a foreign object on to the field of play with the intention of changing the condition of the ball to gain an unfair advantage over your opponent is against not only the laws, but the spirit of the game as well,"" said Pycroft. ""That said, I acknowledge Cameron has accepted responsibility for his actions by pleading guilty to the charge and apologising publicly. ""As a young player starting out in international cricket, I hope the lessons learned from this episode will strongly influence the way he plays the game during the rest of his career."" Players who accumulate four demerit points in a two-year period receive a one-match ban, while those who get eight in the same 24-month period are banned for two matches. Neither Smith nor Bancroft had any demerit points on their records before this incident. Prior to the start of the fourth day's play, CA chief executive James Sutherland said Smith and David Warner had ""agreed to stand down as captain and vice-captain respectively for the remainder of this Test match"". Wicketkeeper Tim Paine was appointed acting captain for the rest of the match, though Smith and Warner continued to play. ""This Test match needs to proceed, and in the interim we will continue to investigate this matter with the urgency that it demands,"" added Sutherland. ""Cricket Australia and Australian cricket fans expect certain standards of conduct from cricketers representing our country, and on this occasion these standards have not been met. ""All Australians, like us, want answers and we will keep you updated on our findings, as a matter of priority."" CA's head of integrity Iain Roy and head of team performance Pat Howard have travelled to Australia to, according to Sutherland, ""gather the relevant information CA need to address this matter and understand it better"". TMS podcast: Australia wakes up to ball-tampering nightmare Australia's prime minister has also spoken about the issue. This video can not be played Australian cheating beyond belief - PM Turnbull ""I am shocked and bitterly disappointed by the news from South Africa,"" said Turnbull. ""It seems beyond belief the Australian cricket team have been involved in cheating. Our cricketers are role models and cricket is synonymous with fair play. How can our team be engaged in cheating like this? It beggars belief."" Turnbull later added: ""I have spoken with David Peever, the chairman of Cricket Australia, and I have expressed to him very clearly and unequivocally my disappointment and concern. He has said to me that Cricket Australia will be responding decisively, as they should. ""It's their responsibility to deal with it, but I have to say that the whole nation, who hold those who wear the baggy green up on a pedestal - about as high as you can get in Australia, certainly higher than any politician, that's for sure - this is a shocking disappointment."" Umpires have the power to change the ball and award five penalty runs to the batting side if they feel it has been altered illegally - although they did not do so in this case Bancroft has been punished by the ICC for attempting to change the condition of the ball - which is prohibited byLaw 41.3.,external Roughing up one side of the ball can help the fielding side achieve ""reverse swing"" - in which the ball moves in the opposite direction to conventional swing, which is achieved by polishing one side of the ball. There are several methods by which the ball can be deliberately roughed up - ranging from the outright illegal (scuffing it with a bottle top, or scratching with fingernails), to those which are frowned upon but frequently take place anyway, such as throwing the ball into the stumps on the bounce, or applying saliva after sucking sugary sweets. Polishing the ball on your clothing is allowed if no artificial substance is used, as is drying a wet ball with a towel that has been approved by the umpires, or removing mud from the ball under an umpire's supervision. The umpire's ultimate sanction, if they feel the ball has been altered illegally, is to change the ball and award five penalty runs to the batting side - although this did not take place in Cape Town. Such an instance did take place at The Oval in 2006 when umpires Darrell Hair and Billy Doctrove ruled that Pakistan had tampered with the ball during a Test against England. Pakistan refused to take the field after tea in protest, andforfeited the Test.,external This video can not be played Watch: Bancroft and Smith admit ball-tampering plan Michael Clarke,Smith's immediate predecessor as Test captain, called it ""a terrible day for Australian cricket"", described the plan as ""premeditated cheating"" and condemned its instigators for choosing Bancroft to carry it out. ""I can't believe the leadership group have got a young kid playing in his eighth Test match to do this,"" Clarke told Australia's Channel Nine. ""We have got the best bowling attack in the world. We don't need to cheat to beat anyone."" Clarke retired from international cricket in 2015 after suffering with a chronic back problem for many years, but when asked whether he would consider a shock return if Smith were to depart, he replied: ""If I was asked by the right people, then I would think about my answer."" Former Test vice-captainAdam Gilchristtold BBC Radio 5 livehe was ""stunned and shocked... embarrassed and sad"". The legendary wicketkeeper said: ""Australian cricket is the laughing stock of the sporting world. ""I remember being a current player and the last thing you wanted was ex-players putting the boot in, but I have the feeling we have been all really badly let down here. ""The only positive is that they admitted it. We'll get stories now where it will be 'oh, all teams do it, in different levels and different ways'. But it's not bending the spirit of the game, it's going outside the laws. It's not acceptable."" Former Australia fast bowlerJason Gillespiesaid on Sky Sports: ""What we're hearing is at least one senior player is absolutely mortified they have been drawn into this. What we need to establish is who is the leadership group. ""It's hard to think there isn't going to be a fall-out and a big change in personnel. It appears there's going to be some big changes on and off the field. ""The Australia side has to have a deep reflection on how they go about the game, how they're perceived in the wider cricketing world. That perception isn't good, that's the brutal reality."" Listen: BBC Radio 5 live In Short - Gilchrist says Australia are a 'laughing stock' Renowned Australian cricket commentatorJim Maxwellgot emotional talking on ABC Grandstand about the ball-tampering issue at the start of the fourth day. ""I do not remember being as disappointed in an Australian team as I feel and I know a number of Australians and colleagues would feel at the moment,"" he said. ""It was so blatant and stupid. It was hugely disappointing."" Vaughan and Maxwell have commentated for Test Match Special together Former England captainMichael Vaughancriticised the ""pathetic penalties"" handed down to Smith and Bancroft. In a series of tweets, Vaughan said: ""Surely this moment was the time to set a precedent. All the team should be penalised."" This video can not be played Swann critical of 'friendless' Australia The South Africa-Australia series had already contained several flashpoints before the sides arrived in Cape Town for the third Test. Warner had to be restrained by team-mates during an off-field altercation with Proteas wicketkeeper Quinton de Kock during the first Test in Durban, for whichboth players were fined by the ICC and given demerit points. South Africa pace bowler Rabada was thenhanded a two-match suspensionafter deliberately brushing shoulders with Smith after celebrating his dismissal in the second Test at Port Elizabeth, butwon an appealto reduce his punishment to one demerit point rather than two, meaning he avoided a ban but remains one point away from it being triggered. Australia coach Darren Lehmann then hit out at what he described as""disgraceful"" verbal abusetowards his side in the early stages of the Cape Town Test. ""The Australian team have been playing under a siege mentality,"" ABC commentator Adam Collins told BBC Test Match Special. ""Lehmann had complained about the treatment the players have been getting - they are furious about what has happened in the last couple of weeks. Steve Smith is not a bad bloke. There is something else going on here. ""But the response on social media is very strong. It is trending against Steve Smith - it's not as if people are defending him. Smith knows he is in a lot of trouble. ""Australian fans would rather see their team lose than win like this."" BBC cricket correspondent Jonathan Agnew Ball-tampering has always happened in cricket but it's exceptionally difficult to prove. This time they have someone who has admitted his guilt - he's a captain, the act was premeditated and, worst of all, he has clearly coerced the most inexperienced player in his team to go out and do the dirty work for them, and that's awful. Australia have very few friends in cricket at the moment. The boorish way in which they've behaved over the years hasn't helped. The current series between Australia and South Africa has been ill-tempered. There's been bad blood about the way the Australians play the game. Many in the cricket world will feel a sense of satisfaction today about what they'll see as chickens coming home to roost. I really think this is an opportunity for the Australian authorities to look very carefully at their game. Smith made his Test debut against Pakistan in 2010, in a neutral series played in England The blond quiff has flattened and darkened somewhat over the years, and on the field Steve Smith is almost unrecognisable from the raw 21-year-old who made his Test debut against Pakistan at Lord's in July 2010. Selected primarily for his leg-spin bowling, Smith made one and 12 batting at number eight and nine in that game. He made two half-centuries in his first 10 Test innings, but was dropped after Australia lost the 2010-11 Ashes to England. His bowling was - and remains - wildly inconsistent, and doubts about his unorthodox batting technique meant he was out of the Test side for two years. But on his return, he slowly became such an integral part of the side that at 26, he was the natural successor to Clarke as captain in 2015, while his batting statistics soared to the point where hesitantcomparisons were drawn with Australia legend Sir Donald Bradman. Passing the 1,000-run mark in the past four calendar years, he was at the top of his game in the 2017-18 Ashes against England, hitting a career-best 239 as skipper at Perth to regain the urn, and averaging an incredible 137.40 across the five Tests to sit at the top of the ICC's batting rankings. Yet his rise has not been without controversy. In March 2017, India were angered afterSmith looked up to the dressing roomwhile pondering whether to review an lbw decision - contrary to ICC regulations that outlaw off-field assistance. And his Australia side's behaviour has been increasingly questioned, with senior Australian radio commentator Jim Maxwell commenting: ""I've started to become more and more offended by the arrogance of some of the players in the way they behave."" Australia came into the series against South Africa on the back of a convincing 4-0 victory on home soil over England, who are involved in a two-Test series in New Zealand. England bowler Stuart Broad says he did not sense anything untoward in the defeat in Australia but says it is ""strange"" Smith's side changed their approach in South Africa. ""We played five Ashes Tests and they reversed it in pretty much all of them, and ondrop-in pitches,"",externalsaid Broad. ""So to then change their method on a tour to South Africa in the third Test match seems a slightly strange one."" He added: ""There were occasions when they we reverse swinging it when we didn't find the means to be able to do that. We just class that down to home conditions. ""We move the ball differently to different teams in England, and Australia moved it better than we did and out-bowled us in Australia. That's how we saw it. ""Steve has come out and said it's the first time they've ever tried it and we have to believe his words."" Meanwhile, the social media world has picked up on a tweet Bancroft sent in 2013 - with England women's spinner Alex Hartley among those to notice.

Car deliberately driven into childrenA teenage girl is in a serious condition after the attempted murder in the Castlemilk area of Glasgow.12h12 hours agoGlasgow & West Scotland,"A teenage girl was seriously hurt when a car was driven deliberately into a group of children in Glasgow. The children, aged between 12 and 14, were standing on the pavement near shops in Castlemilk at about 15:30 on Saturday afternoon. A man drove his silver Vauxhall Astra at the group, hitting five of the children before driving off. A 14-year-old girl is in a serious but stable condition. Police are treating the incident as attempted murder. Four of the others - two girls aged 12 and 14 and two boys aged 12 and 13 - were treated for minor injuries either at the scene, or at local hospitals and have since been released. The incident happened at Stravanan Road and the man drove off towards Birgidale Road. There was a passenger, another man, in the car at the time. The group was standing in Stravanan Road in Castlemilk when the car struck There was no suggestion that the incident was terrorism-related. Det Insp Peter Sharp said:  ""This vehicle was deliberately driven at this group of children and as such we are treating this incident at attempted murder. ""Extensive police inquiries are continuing to trace the man driving the car, his male passenger and also the vehicle involved.  Officers are following a number of lines of enquiry. ""At this time I would appeal to any witnesses to this incident, or anyone with information that may assist this investigation, including anyone who may have details of the silver coloured Vauxhall Astra involved to contact police as a matter of urgency."" Extra police patrols will be made in the area to reassure the local community.

"Scouts pay out Â£42,000 over autism claim","Ben Gleeson joined a cub scout group in Hertfordshire in 2015 An 11-year-old boy has received Â£42,000 in compensation after his family said his cub scout group discriminated against him for having autism. Ben Gleeson joined a group in Hertfordshire in 2015, but was later told he could not go to camps or take part in athletics without supervision. His family sued the group - saying it amounted to a ban - and the dispute was settled out of court last year. The Scout Association said it had apologised and started an inquiry. Ben joined the 10th Harpenden Scout Group in January 2015, having previously been a member of the beavers. His parents said they explained his autism to the scout leaders and suggested strategies to help calm and distract him, should he get upset. We grew up not knowing we were autistic US Boy Scouts revoke badges from Down's syndrome boy They said his autism manifested as anxiety to change and that he needed to know plans in advance. They said that although few people would realise he was autistic on first meeting him, if something unpredictable happened he could become distressed. In March 2016, Ben had a short episode at a cub scout camp in which he became distressed. He tried to run a short distance from the rest of the group at an indoor venue after he was asked to change into a pair of shoes he could not find. Later, he said he did not want to join an egg-and-spoon race because of a phobia of spoons. Soon afterwards, the pack leaders said Ben could not travel with the rest of the group on a bus to events or participate in athletics.  They also said he had to have one-to-one supervision at other events. The scout group said the decision had been made for the health and safety of the whole pack. However, Ben's parents - who are both lawyers - argued the decision effectively amounted to a ban. This video can not be played Beverly Gleeson said the Scout group's decision would ""single Ben out"" While she accepted her son needed some extra support, Ben's mum, Beverly Gleeson, told the BBC the decision was a ""complete overreaction"". She said: ""Pretty much every event had to be supervised on a one-to-one basis, which I felt wasn't inclusive."" She said the decision would ""single Ben out"" and that she feared it would make him ""feel different"". ""I felt he didn't need it.  He didn't have this level of supervision at school. He'd made one mistake and then that was it, they wanted to make the rules and regulations. It was supposed to be a dialogue,"" she added. Ben, who said he enjoyed being with his friends and taking part in the activities, added: ""It was quite upsetting, my friends were there and I quite enjoyed it."" ""I don't like the idea of someone following me all the time,"" he added. The family's solicitor, Chris Fry of Fry Law, said: ""I am pretty sure no one goes into scouting looking to exclude anyone. Those giving up their time need to know that they are properly trained and that they are protected by the organisation that they love and serve. ""The organisation needs to anticipate that scouts with autism need reasonable adjustments so they can access activities in the same way as other children."" The family eventually sued under the Equality Act, as well as for breach of privacy and under data protection legislation - claiming emails and a briefing to parents had identified them. Insurers for the Scout Association settled the case out of court, paying the Gleeson family Â£42,000 plus costs. The Gleesons have donated some of the money to a local autism charity, while Ben's portion is being held in a trust. 'Orange snow' baffles eastern Europeans Harry Kane and the making of a Premier League star The country where citizenship depends on your skin colour The 10th Harpenden Scout Group disputed some of the family's claims. Ms Gleeson said it was only after the BBC had become involved that the Scout's national headquarters apologised to them. In a statement, the Scout Association said: ""The handling of Ben's case was completely unacceptable. ""We are very sorry that Ben and his family were not supported as they should have been by their cub scout pack, and we have made a personal apology to them. ""While cases like this are very unusual, we know that action must be taken. We have established an inquiry to investigate what went wrong in this case."" The association said it was also looking at plans for mandatory training for all adult volunteers on ""how to make reasonable adjustments for young people with developmental disabilities"".

Fugitive Catalan ex-leader detained,"Independence supporters have gathered in Barcelona to protest against the arrest Catalonia's ex-leader Carles Puigdemont has been detained by German police acting on a European arrest warrant. Mr Puigdemont, who is wanted in Spain for sedition and rebellion, was held crossing from Denmark on the way to Belgium, his lawyer said. Mr Puigdemont will appear before a German judge on Monday. The ex-leader's supporters gathered in Barcelona to protest against his arrest. The charges he faces in Spain could result in 30 years in prison. Mr Puigdemont has been living in self-imposed exile in Belgium since Catalonia's parliament unilaterally declared independence from Spain in October. He was visiting Finland last week when the arrest warrant against him was reissued, and he slipped out of the country on Friday before Finnish authorities could arrest him. He is spending the night in a prison in the north German town of Neumuenster. His court appearance on Monday will be a formality to confirm his identity. Afterwards a decision will be made about whether he will remain in custody while the extradition order is being processed. The man who wants to break up Spain Catalan crisis in 300 words German police said that Mr Puigdemont was detained by a highway patrol in the northern state of Schleswig-Holstein, which borders Denmark. After the news of his arrest broke on Sunday, thousands of demonstrators poured on to the streets of Barcelona. Scuffles break out between police and protesters in Barcelona They chanted ""Freedom for the political prisoners"" and ""This Europe is shameful!"" as they headed to the offices of the European Commission and the German consulate. A smaller protest was held in Girona, where Mr Puigdemont once served as mayor. Tensions in Catalonia are very high and its separatist leaders abandoned plans to name a new president following the arrest of the latest candidate, Jordi Turull, on Friday. Protesters clashed with police in Barcelona on Friday night after Spain's Supreme Court ruled 25 Catalan leaders should be tried for rebellion, embezzlement or disobeying the state. Mr Turull was among five people taken into custody in fresh arrests. The rulings were considered the most serious challenge to date to the Catalan independence movement. Almost the entire leadership now faces a major legal fight. This video can not be played Police clashed with protesters in Barcelona on Friday Following the referendum, the central government in Madrid sacked the Catalan regional government, imposed direct rule and called new elections but pro-independence parties returned with a slim majority. International warrants for Mr Puigdemont and other Catalan leaders were withdrawn in December by a Spanish judge, who said they had shown a willingness to return to the country. The warrants were reissued on Friday, surprising Mr Puigdemont, who had been in Finland to give a university lecture. Among those also wanted is Catalonia's former education minister, Clara Ponsati. She is in Scotland, where she has a position at the University of St Andrews, and saysshe is willing to hand herself in. Mr Puigdemont is wanted in Spain on charges of rebellion and sedition Carles Puigdemont, 55, is a former journalist who worked for pro-independence media in Catalonia and headed the Catalan News Agency. After moving to politics, he became an MP and later mayor of Girona, north-east of Barcelona. In 2016, he became leader of Catalonia and led the region to the referendum the following year. During his self-imposed exile following the resulting crisis, Mr Puigdemont told Belgian TV he was not hiding from ""real justice"" but from the ""clearly politicised"" Spanish legal system. This video can not be played Why is there a Catalan crisis? The answer is in its past, as Europe correspondent Gavin Lee explains 1 October 2017:The independence referendum takes place in Catalonia; it is deemed illegal by Spain and boycotted by many potential voters 27 October:Catalonia's leaders declare independence, which leads to the Spanish government imposing direct rule on the region and dissolving its parliament 30 October:Charges of rebellion, sedition and misuse of public funds are brought against various sacked members of the Catalan government, including Mr Puigdemont 2 November:Several former Catalan ministers are taken into custody in Spain 3 November:European Arrest Warrants are issued against Mr Puigdemont and four of his allies, who have all fled to Belgium 5 December:A Spanish judge withdraws the European arrest warrants but says the group still face possible charges for sedition and rebellion 21 December:Carles Puigdemont is re-elected to parliament during Catalan's regional elections - which Spanish PM Mariano Rajoy had called to ""restore democracy"" 1 March 2018:Mr Puigdemont says he is stepping aside and he backs detained activist Jordi Sanchez to run as Catalonia's president 21 March:Mr Sanchez drops his leadership bid and instead the candidacy is passed to Jordi Turull, who the following day is rejected by hardline separatists 23 March:Mr Turull and various others are arrested in Spain, and the European arrest warrants are reissued The man who wants to break up Spain Puigdemont abandons Catalan presidency Catalan ex-leader 'avoids Finnish arrest' Jailed activist ends bid to lead Catalonia Catalan politician defies court summons Catalonia's quarrel with Spain explained Death toll rises amid most destructive wildfire in Los Angeles' history Moment friends abandon house as Palisades fire closes in 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Why does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?

Briton jailed for killing wife in DubaiFrancis Matthew's 10-year sentence for killing wife Jane with a hammer is criticised by her relatives.,"Jane Matthew was hit twice on the head with a hammer The family of a British woman killed by her husband in Dubai says ""justice has not been done"" after he was jailed for 10 years. Francis Matthew killed his 62-year-old wife Jane by hitting her twice on the head with a hammer at their villa in the city, the Dubai Court of the First Instance heard. Matthew, 61, former editor of the Gulf News, had blamed the attack on robbers. The court said he would be deported after his sentence. He had initially been charged with premeditated murder which could have seen him get the death penalty but judges changed the charge to ""beating which led to death"",the Gulf News reported,external. Francis Mathew used to be editor of the Gulf News The couple had been arguing about money at their three-bedroom villa in the Jumeirah neighbourhood of Dubai - a city in the United Arab Emirates, on the Persian Gulf. The attack took place on 4 July 2017, the court heard. Mrs Matthew's family, who were in the court, said the crime was a ""deliberate act"", adding: ""Arguments about money can arise in any marriage and cannot justify this killing."" In a statement, they said they wanted his sentence increased on appeal. They said: ""Jane was a loving wife, mother, daughter, sister and aunt. ""Losing her in such a brutal manner has left the family both bewildered and shocked."" Matthew had edited the Gulf News between 1995 and 2005 and was the paper's editor-at-large at the time of the killing.

The woman behind a post-genocide rock revivalVideoVideoRAF at 100: Ewan McGregor meets the heroesVideoVideo,"Kak Channthy - a model of strength and independence Cambodian singer Kak Channthy rose from poverty to perform in front of audiences worldwide. Dubbed Cambodia's Amy Winehouse, she was the voice and face of a revival of the legendary 1960s rock scene that swept the country pre-genocide. Her band, the Cambodian Space Project, became one of the few Cambodian rock bands to make it overseas. Her death on Tuesday, in a car crash at the age of 38, has moved her fans around the globe. ""She was a Cambodian hero and now, so sadly, a legend of her people and her time,"" the band's co-founder and ex-husband Julien Poulson told the BBC. ""Her music, her voice, her life and her story have touched so many people from many different walks of life and from all around the word."" Kak Channthy came from a poor family in rural Cambodia and much of her story is that of the typical journey of a poor girl moving from the countryside to the city. In Phnom Penh, she worked in a long line of tough jobs, earning in some cases less than a dollar a day. Cambodian Space Project was founded by Channthy and Julien Poulson (right) ""I was singing in a karaoke bar but in 2006 I wanted to have a go at singing professionally,"" she told the BBC in a 2017 interview. ""So I asked the boss of one beer garden to let me sing in front of him. But I was so nervous I dropped the microphone! Fortunately that day the boss accepted me and decided to hire me and I got paid $2 a day."" That's where she was spotted by Australian musician Julien Poulson and the two went on to form Cambodian Space Project. ""Channthy was inspired by the great Cambodian singers of the 1960s,"" Scott Bywater who played with her in the band as well as on side projects, told the BBC. ""In turn, she has been an inspiration to a new generation of Cambodian singers, excited by her revival of the music of their grandparents."" The vibrant rock scene of the 1960s and early 70s is seen as Cambodia's golden age, before the terror of the Khmer Rouge eradicated all modern culture and music. Most of the famous singers from those days like Ros Serey Sothea, Pan Ron and Sinn Sisamouth died during the brutal genocide between 1975 and 1979 and their music and legacy seemed lost forever. Only a gradual revival and rediscovery of the music from dusty attics, archives abroad and memory helped to bring that music back from the silence. Performing a mix of covers and original songs,Cambodian Space Project were at the forefront of a resurgence of pride in that era.. ""Cambodian Space Project is certainly a big part of Cambodia's music and cultural revival,"" Mr Poulson said. ""But Channthy epitomised and embodied all the heartbreak and sorry of Cambodia but also the very nature of survival itself and she overcame great odds to become an underdog champion of the world."" In recent years she also started her own side project Channthy Cha Cha, playing local shows back in Cambodia. ""She had an extraordinary charm and sincerity both on stage and off - you didn't need to know the language to be moved and excited by her singing and her songwriting - and made friends and fans everywhere she went,"" Mr Bywater recalls. ""I will remember her laughing and dancing, and her delight at what a difference her singing made to those around her. She is a model of female strength and independence to Cambodian and foreigner alike. Our hearts are at half mast."" Her struggle to overcome poverty and hardship to make it to the stages of the world was also the subject of a 2015 documentary Not Easy Rock'n'Roll which premiered at the Sydney Film Festival that year. ""Sometimes I still don't believe that a person from the countryside and with no education can receive a lot of support from all walks of life,"" she told the BBC last year looking back at her extraordinary story.

Corbyn sorry over Labour anti-Semitism,"Mr Corbyn said he would meet representatives from the Jewish community in the ""coming days, weeks and months"" Jeremy Corbyn has said he is ""sincerely sorry"" for the pain caused by ""pockets of anti-Semitism"" in the Labour party. In a statement, the Labour leader said he would be meeting representatives of the Jewish community this week to ""rebuild"" confidence in his party. He said Labour was ""anti-racist"" and he ""utterly condemns"" anti-Semitism. The comments came after Mr Corbyn was criticised for sending anapparently supportive message to the creator of an allegedly anti-Semitic mural in 2012. In a message sent via Facebook, he had appeared to question a decision to remove the artist's controversial mural. He later called the mural ""deeply disturbing"" and backed its removal. Mr Corbyn's statement, which was released on Sunday evening, said: ""I want to be clear that I will not tolerate any form of anti-Semitism that exists in and around our movement. ""We must stamp this out from our party and movement. ""We recognise that anti-Semitism has occurred in pockets within the Labour Party, causing pain and hurt to our Jewish community in the Labour Party and the rest of the country. ""I am sincerely sorry for the pain which has been caused. Mr Corbyn said he and the party - which has ""deep roots in the Jewish community"" - were now campaigning to ""increase support and confidence in Labour"" among Jewish people in Britain. He said: ""I will be meeting representatives from the Jewish community over the coming days, weeks and months to rebuild that confidence in Labour as a party which gives effective voice to Jewish concerns and is implacably opposed to anti-Semitism in all its forms."" Tom Watson apologises over 'anti-Semitic' mural row Jeremy Corbyn regrets comments about 'anti-Semitic' mural The statement came after Jewish community leaders organised a protest in Westminster on Monday. The Jewish Leadership Council and the Board of Deputies of British Jews said ""enough is enough"", announcing they will deliver a letter to the Parliamentary Labour Party. The Campaign Against Anti-Semitism group has also called for a national protest against anti-Semitism in Labour. The group has compiled a list of complaints against Mr Corbyn and deputy leader Tom Watson, who on Sunday also apologised for any hurt caused. In October 2012, street artist Mear One posted a picture of his mural in east London called ""Freedom of Humanity"" on Facebook, with the words: ""Tomorrow they want to buff my mural. Freedom of expression. London calling. Public Art."" Mr Corbyn replied: ""Why? You are in good company. Rockerfeller destroyed Diego Viera's mural because it includes a picture of Lenin."" More recently, Labour MP Luciana Berger sought clarification from the leader's office on the 2012 comments. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mr Corbyn said: ""I sincerely regret that I did not look more closely at the image I was commenting on, the contents of which are deeply disturbing and anti-Semitic. ""I am opposed to the production of anti-Semitic material of any kind, and the defence of free speech cannot be used as a justification for the promotion of anti-Semitism in any form."" Mear One - whose real name is Kalen Ockerman - has denied being anti-Semitic, saying the mural was about ""class and privilege"". On Sunday, senior Labour figures joined in condemnation of the mural but defended Mr Corbyn. Shadow transport secretary Andy McDonald told Sky News that Mr Corbyn ""hasn't got an anti-Semitic bone in his body"" and that the row had ""misinterpreted the intentions of a really good and decent man"". And Labour's Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer said the mural was ""grotesque and disgusting"" but that Mr Corbyn had given his explanation for his online comment.

Russian shopping mall blaze kills dozens,"This video can not be played Firefighters tackle fatal shopping centre fire At least 64 people have died in a fire that engulfed a shopping and entertainment complex in the Siberian coal-mining city of Kemerovo. Many of the victims are children. Ten people are still listed as missing. The blaze started on an upper floor of the Winter Cherry complex during school holidays. The mall's shops, cinema and bowling alley were packed at the time. Video posted on social media showed people jumping from windows to escape the flames. ""According to preliminary information, the roof collapsed in two cinemas,"" Russia's Investigative Committee said in a statement. The cause of the fire is not yet known. The authorities have launched an investigation. Four people have been detained for questioning, including the head of the company that manages the shopping centre, according to the Investigative Committee. The owner of the Winter Cherry complex is among those being held. The fire broke out at about 17:00 (10:00 GMT) on Sunday. Some 660 emergency personnel were deployed in the rescue effort. Firefighters said the building was still smouldering a day later, with smoke billowing out and the remaining structures at risk of collapse. The region's deputy governor Vladimir Chernov was quoted as saying the fire probably began in a children's trampoline room. ""The preliminary suspicion is that a child had a cigarette lighter which ignited foam rubber in this trampoline room, and it erupted like gunpowder,"" he said. However, Rossiya 24 TV, a national broadcaster, said an electrical fault was the most likely cause - as in most previous deadly fires in Russia. Russia's commissioner for children's rights, Anna Kuznetsova, has blamed negligence, and called for urgent safety checks at similar entertainment complexes. Firefighters had to be lifted to a great height to tackle the blaze Two witnesses told BBC Russian that they had seen the fire blazing in the trampoline room on the fourth floor but had not heard any fire alarm. Meanwhile, witness Anna Zarechneva told Russian RBC News that ""a woman burst into the cinema during the film and shouted 'Fire! Fire!', and we started running out"". ""The lights didn't come on in there to help us escape. We got out by following the floor lighting. But at that point no alarm bells were ringing. I only heard an alarm when I reached the first floor."" At least nine of the bodies found so far are children. As well as those killed, 11 injured victims are being treated in hospital, suffering from smoke inhalation. Smoke billowed from the building The most serious case is an 11-year-old boy whose parents and siblings died in the fire, Health Minister Veronika Skvortsova said. He reportedly fell from the fourth floor and is in intensive care with multiple injuries. An Instagram post from Kemerovo showed a big queue of volunteers waiting to donate blood at a clinic.

Kemerovo, a key coal-producing area, lies about 3,600km (2,200 miles) east of Moscow. The shopping centre, covering 23,000 sq m (248,000 sq ft), opened in 2013. It includes a petting zoo, all of whose animals are reported to have died. Yevgeny Dedyukhin, deputy head of the Kemerovo region emergency department, said the area of the fire was about 1,500 sq m.

"'Largest ever increase' in midwife trainingMidwife representatives welcome the move but say more training places ""is only half of the problem"".10h10 hours agoHealth","More than 3,000 places on midwifery training courses are to be created over the next four years in England as part of plans to meet NHS staffing demands. The government has announced a 25% boost in training places, which it said amounted to the ""largest ever"" increase in NHS midwives and maternity staff. It followsa similar plan for nurses which was announced last year. The Royal College of Midwives welcomed the move but said training more midwives was only half of the problem. The plan needs investment and time to make it work, the RCM added. An extra 650 midwifery training places will be created next year, followed by 1,000 new places for the three subsequent years. The news came after midwives, along with more than one million NHS staff,were offered pay increases of at least 6.5% over three years. The Â£97m bill for 'midwife shortage' The making of a male midwife Meet the 'backpack midwife' bringing healthcare for all Call to expand pro-breastfeeding scheme Health and Social Care Secretary Jeremy Hunt will officially announce the measures at an event on Tuesday. Alongside the increase in training places, Mr Hunt will promise mothers that they will be seen by the same midwife throughout labour, pregnancy and birth by 2021. Appearing on ITV's Peston on Sunday, Mr Hunt said ""continuity of carers"" could potentially save 700 babies' lives a year and prevent a further 500 from being born with brain damage, but ""it needs more midwives"". He said: ""We know we need to make maternity care safer."" The maternity support worker role will also be developed with national set standards It is part of his ongoing ambition to make the NHS ""the safest place in the world to give birth"" and halve the rate of stillbirths, neonatal and maternal deaths and brain injuries during birth by 2025, the Department of Health said. Mr Hunt will also announce plans to develop the role of maternity support workers (MSW) by creating set national standards that they must adhere to. New training routes into midwifery will also be introduced. By Nick Triggle, BBC health correspondent Increasing student midwife numbers is the easy bit. As the government has scrapped the bursary for midwives, it is much less costly to the public purse to increase the number of places. Filling them when student midwives now have to pay fees may be another matter. But even if this is achieved, it doesn't guarantee the midwife workforce will grow. Over the last five years 7,700 newly-qualified midwives have joined the profession. But the numbers leaving - either because of retirement or, increasingly, quitting the NHS - reached 8,900. In fact, the only reason the workforce was able to increase over that period - by 1,500 to 22,500 - was because the NHS was able to recruit midwives from abroad. If the NHS cannot improve its ability to keep staff - and the pay deal announced last week is only likely to help to some extent - the rise in student numbers will have a limited impact. The Royal College of Midwivesestimates that services in England are 3,500 midwives short.,external Chief executive of the RCM, Gill Walton, called the latest move ""a very long overdue acknowledgement"" of the need for more midwives. ""This announcement must be welcomed,"" she said. ""It will come as some relief to NHS midwives who have been working incredibly hard, for many years, with increasing demands and inadequate resources."" But Ms Walton warned the measures were ""ambitious"" and would ""not transform maternity services right now"", adding the extra recruited midwives would not qualify until 2022. She added: ""Simply training more midwives is only half of the problem. Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning,external ""The other key issue is ensuring that when these midwives qualify they actually get jobs in the NHS. ""We must get a commitment from the government and trusts to employ them. ""Trusts are going to need an increase in the money they get so they can employ the new midwives."" Last year, the Department of Health scrapped its NHS bursary scheme for trainee nurses and midwives in England. It meant new students enrolling on most nursing and midwifery courses from August 2017 have to pay tuition fees like other students. I'm a man and a midwife. Are you OK with that?

Russia shopping mall blaze kills dozens,"This video can not be played Firefighters tackle fatal shopping centre fire At least 64 people have died in a fire that engulfed a shopping and entertainment complex in the Siberian coal-mining city of Kemerovo. Many of the victims are children. Ten people are still listed as missing. The blaze started on an upper floor of the Winter Cherry complex during school holidays. The mall's shops, cinema and bowling alley were packed at the time. Video posted on social media showed people jumping from windows to escape the flames. ""According to preliminary information, the roof collapsed in two cinemas,"" Russia's Investigative Committee said in a statement. The cause of the fire is not yet known. The authorities have launched an investigation. Four people have been detained for questioning, including the head of the company that manages the shopping centre, according to the Investigative Committee. The owner of the Winter Cherry complex is among those being held. The fire broke out at about 17:00 (10:00 GMT) on Sunday. Some 660 emergency personnel were deployed in the rescue effort. Firefighters said the building was still smouldering a day later, with smoke billowing out and the remaining structures at risk of collapse. The region's deputy governor Vladimir Chernov was quoted as saying the fire probably began in a children's trampoline room. ""The preliminary suspicion is that a child had a cigarette lighter which ignited foam rubber in this trampoline room, and it erupted like gunpowder,"" he said. However, Rossiya 24 TV, a national broadcaster, said an electrical fault was the most likely cause - as in most previous deadly fires in Russia. Russia's commissioner for children's rights, Anna Kuznetsova, has blamed negligence, and called for urgent safety checks at similar entertainment complexes. Firefighters had to be lifted to a great height to tackle the blaze Two witnesses told BBC Russian that they had seen the fire blazing in the trampoline room on the fourth floor but had not heard any fire alarm. Meanwhile, witness Anna Zarechneva told Russian RBC News that ""a woman burst into the cinema during the film and shouted 'Fire! Fire!', and we started running out"". ""The lights didn't come on in there to help us escape. We got out by following the floor lighting. But at that point no alarm bells were ringing. I only heard an alarm when I reached the first floor."" At least nine of the bodies found so far are children. As well as those killed, 11 injured victims are being treated in hospital, suffering from smoke inhalation. Smoke billowed from the building The most serious case is an 11-year-old boy whose parents and siblings died in the fire, Health Minister Veronika Skvortsova said. He reportedly fell from the fourth floor and is in intensive care with multiple injuries. An Instagram post from Kemerovo showed a big queue of volunteers waiting to donate blood at a clinic.

Davis: Deal with EU 'incredibly probable',"It is ""incredibly probable"" that the UK will reach a final deal with the EU, the Brexit secretary says. David Davis defended planning for a stalemate, saying it was like having home insurance when ""you don't expect your house to burn down"". He also hit back at Tory Eurosceptic concerns about what has been agreed so far. Last week prominent backbencher Jacob Rees-Mogg accused the government of giving away ""almost everything"". Owen Smith 'stood by principles' on Brexit EU agrees guidelines 'in seconds' Protesters throw fish in Thames in Brexit protest But speaking on BBC One's Andrew Marr Show, Mr Davis said the UK had succeeded in getting a transition deal for the period after March 2019 and moving talks onto trade, adding: ""So I don't think Jacob's got a point."" He insisted a solution could be found to avoid introducing physical border checks on the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, saying a ""whole lot of technology"" was available to achieve this. And challenged on the EU's controversial ""backstop"" proposal of Northern Ireland effectively remaining in the customs union, he said the ""overwhelmingly likely option"" was a free trade and customs agreement which would make finding a solution to the border question ""much, much easier"". Mr Davis said the progress made in talks with Brussels meant it was now ""incredibly probable, very, very highly probable"" that there would be a final deal. But he said ""you can never stop making arrangements"" for a potential no-deal scenario, ""because that's one of the things that guarantees the deal"". ""You don't expect your house to burn down, it's less than a one in 100,000 chance, but you have house insurance anyway,"" he said. Mr Davis predicted the deal would be nothing like the current arrangements between the EU and Norway. Theresa May has already ruled out this model, which gives Norway access to the single market while accepting EU laws and free movement and making annual financial commitments to Brussels. ""This will not really look like any other deal as it stands at the moment,"" Mr Davis said, predicting ""the most comprehensive trade deal ever"". He also sought to reassure worries about fishing rights, saying that after the end of the transition period in 2021: ""We will negotiate with our surrounding states so that we have access to their waters and theirs to ours, and markets and so on, but it will be under our control."" Mr Rees-Mogg, meanwhile, is urging the UK to be prepared to walk out on talks and warning that rowing back on Brexit would be ""the most almighty smash to the national psyche"" akin to the Suez crisis, when Britain and France attempted to regain control of the Suez Canal from Egypt in 1956. ""It would be an admission of abject failure, a view of our politicians, of our leaders, of our establishment that we were not fit, that we were too craven, that we were too weak to be able to govern ourselves and that therefore we had to go crawling back to the mighty bastion of power that is Brussels,"" he will say in a speech on Tuesday.

'Beast of Wombwell' found dead,"Peter Pickering (pictured here in 1972) was convicted of killing schoolgirl Shirley Boldy and suspected of murdering Elsie Frost A convicted child killer dubbed the ""Beast of Wombwell"" has died in a psychiatric hospital. Peter Pickering, 80, stabbed and strangled 14-year-old Shirley Boldy in Wombwell, near Barnsley, in 1972 and was suspected of murdering Wakefield schoolgirl Elsie Frost in 1965. On Tuesday he wasconvicted of raping a womanweeks before he killed Shirley and was waiting to be sentenced. He had been detained under a hospital order since admitting killing Shirley. Pickering had been detained under a hospital order since he admitted killing Shirley Boldy West Yorkshire Police said Pickering died on Saturday night after falling ill in a secure psychiatric accommodation in Berkshire and his death was not being treated as suspicious. Det Sup Nick Wallen said: ""We can now formally confirm that Peter Pickering was the man we arrested and interviewed over the last two years as part of the renewed investigation into the murder of 14-year-old schoolgirl Elsie Frost in Wakefield in 1965. ""We strongly suspected that Peter Pickering was responsible for her murder. We had been liaising with the Crown Prosecution Service and it was our expectation that Pickering would be charged in due course. ""His unexpected death clearly means that will no longer happen."" In 1965 a major murder inquiry was launched after Elsie's body was found at the bottom of a flight of steps by a dog walker. In 2015 police launched a fresh appeal to find her killer. Elsie Frost, 14, was found dead by dog walker in Wakefield, in 1965 It came as a result ofthe BBC Radio 4 podcast series Who Killed Elsie Frost?which followed her brother Colin Frost and sister Anne Cleave as theysought justice for the schoolgirl. Mr Frost said hearing about Pickering's death felt ""like a hollow victory"". ""We really needed to see this man in court,"" he said. ""That day's been taken away from us. We've been really close, but it's not going to have the right ending now. ""When the detective rang me this morning, I laughed it off. But as the day's gone onâ¦ I'm almost speechless."" Colin Frost (pictured here in 2015) fought to get documents relating to the original murder investigation, including the inquest file Detectives said the rape Pickering was convicted of this week only came to light while they were investigating the murder of Elsie, who was stabbed in the back and head while walking through a railway tunnel, just off a canal towpath. The woman he raped, who cannot be named for legal reasons, told his trial she did not think she would have been believed if she had reported the attack in the 1970s. She was then persuaded by police to co-operate in 2016. During the rape trial, Leeds Crown Court heard Pickering had lured his victim into his van before driving to a secluded spot in 1972. Peter Pickering admitted the manslaughter by diminished responsibility of 14-year-old Shirley Boldy in 1972 He then subjected her to an ordeal that involved handcuffing her and burning her breasts with cigarettes. The woman told the jury: ""I remain of the fervent belief that whether he has a mental illness or not, the man is a monster and wherever he is now that's the right place for him to be."" Weeks after the rape, he abducted, raped, strangled and stabbed 14-year-old Shirley Boldy to death on her way home from school in Wombwell. He later admitted manslaughter by diminished responsibility the same year and has been in secure psychiatric hospitals, including Broadmoor. Most recently he had been detained at Thornford Park Hospital in Berkshire.

Car deliberately driven into children,"A teenage girl was seriously hurt when a car was driven deliberately into a group of children in Glasgow. The children, aged between 12 and 14, were standing on the pavement near shops in Castlemilk at about 15:30 on Saturday afternoon. A man drove his silver Vauxhall Astra at the group, hitting five of the children before driving off. A 14-year-old girl is in a serious but stable condition. Police are treating the incident as attempted murder. Four of the others - two girls aged 12 and 14 and two boys aged 12 and 13 - were treated for minor injuries either at the scene, or at local hospitals and have since been released. The incident happened at Stravanan Road and the man drove off towards Birgidale Road. There was a passenger, another man, in the car at the time. The group was standing in Stravanan Road in Castlemilk when the car struck There was no suggestion that the incident was terrorism-related. Det Insp Peter Sharp said:  ""This vehicle was deliberately driven at this group of children and as such we are treating this incident at attempted murder. ""Extensive police inquiries are continuing to trace the man driving the car, his male passenger and also the vehicle involved.  Officers are following a number of lines of enquiry.

Alagiah: Screening might have caught cancer,"Alagiah after returning from his treatment in 2015 BBC news presenter George Alagiah says his bowel cancer could have been caught earlier if the screening programme in England was the same as in Scotland. The 62-year-old was first treated in April 2014 and returned to screen after 18 months, but he confirmed the stage four cancer had come back in 2017. Screening is automatically offered from the age of 50 in Scotland, but only from 60 in England. Over 40,000 people are diagnosed with bowel cancer in the UK every year. Chances of survival for at least five years with stage four bowel cancer are less than 10%, while for stage one it is nearly 100%. Allow Twitter content?

Watson apology over Corbyn mural post,"This video can not be played Watson: ""I am very, very sorry that people feel hurt by this"" Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson says Jeremy Corbyn was right to express regret for sending an apparently supportive message to the creator of an allegedly anti-Semitic mural. Jeremy Corbyn faced criticism over his initial response to a Facebook post by street artist Mear One in 2012. He later called the mural ""deeply disturbing"" and backed its removal. Mr Watson also apologised personally for any hurt that had been caused by his leader's comments. Corbyn 'regret' over anti-Semitic mural row In October 2012, Mear One posted a picture of his mural in east London called ""Freedom of Humanity"" on Facebook, with the words: ""Tomorrow they want to buff my mural. Freedom of expression. London calling. Public Art."" Mr Corbyn replied: ""Why? You are in good company. Rockerfeller destroyed Diego [Rivera's] mural because it includes a picture of Lenin."" More recently, Labour MP Luciana Berger sought clarification from the leader's office on the 2012 comments - made three years before Mr Corbyn became the party's leader. Mr Corbyn said: ""I sincerely regret that I did not look more closely at the image I was commenting on, the contents of which are deeply disturbing and anti-Semitic. ""I am opposed to the production of anti-Semitic material of any kind, and the defence of free speech cannot be used as a justification for the promotion of anti-Semitism in any form."" Mear One - whose real name is Kalen Ockerman - has denied being anti-Semitic, saying the mural was about ""class and privilege"". Allow Twitter content?

Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, Mr Watson was shown the mural and asked for his reaction to it. ""My reaction is that is a horrible anti-Semitic mural that was rightly taken down,"" he said. But he defended his leader - who said he regretted he ""did not look more closely at the image"" before commenting online - adding: ""You are showing it to me on a 32-inch screen on national television and I have seen it about 100 times on social media. ""It's very different from seeing it on Facebook when you are on the move."" Mr Watson said Mr Corbyn had made his comment in regards to freedom of expression, but apologised for any offence caused. ""I am very, very sorry that people feel hurt by this and that is why I think it is right that Jeremy has expressed regret for it,"" said Mr Watson. The deputy leader added that it was time Labour said ""enough is enough"" and they would ""work harder to stamp out anti-Semitism"" in the party. Jeremy Corbyn says he ""wholeheartedly supported"" the removal of the mural in east London Shadow Brexit Secretary Keir Starmer said the mural was ""grotesque and disgusting"" but Mr Corbyn had given his explanation for his online comment. He told ITV's Peston on Sunday: ""The most important thing here is that the Labour Party keeps on saying that anti-semitism has no place in our party, in our communities, or in our society. ""We've got to have zero tolerance, and zero tolerance has got to be more than two words. It's got to dictate everything the Labour Party does in relation to anti-Semitism."" Shadow transport secretary Andy McDonald told Sky News that Mr Corbyn ""hasn't got an anti-Semitic bone in his body"" and that the row had ""misinterpreted the intentions of a really good and decent man"". But Ms Berger called Mr Corbyn's response ""wholly inadequate"". Shetweeted,external:  ""It fails to understand on any level the hurt and anguish felt about Anti-Semitism.

On Friday, Labour MP Angela Smith joined other members in supporting Ms Berger and sent a statement to the Leader's Office, calling for Mr Corbyn to appear before MPs to explain himself. It read: ""It is horrifying that anyone in our party - never mind the leader - should be able to condone anti-Semitism without facing consequences. And rather than facing up, Jeremy Corbyn has chosen to dissemble to defend himself. ""It is simply not credible to suggest that a man with his knowledge of foreign affairs did not recognise those images for what they were. ""Many of us would call for a formal disciplinary process, but the sad truth is that our party has been so badly undermined that no one would believe it would be meaningful."" Allow Twitter content?

'Largest ever increase' in midwife training,"More than 3,000 places on midwifery training courses are to be created over the next four years in England as part of plans to meet NHS staffing demands. The government has announced a 25% boost in training places, which it said amounted to the ""largest ever"" increase in NHS midwives and maternity staff. It followsa similar plan for nurses which was announced last year. The Royal College of Midwives welcomed the move but said training more midwives was only half of the problem. The plan needs investment and time to make it work, the RCM added. An extra 650 midwifery training places will be created next year, followed by 1,000 new places for the three subsequent years. The news came after midwives, along with more than one million NHS staff,were offered pay increases of at least 6.5% over three years. The Â£97m bill for 'midwife shortage' The making of a male midwife Meet the 'backpack midwife' bringing healthcare for all Call to expand pro-breastfeeding scheme Health and Social Care Secretary Jeremy Hunt will officially announce the measures at an event on Tuesday. Alongside the increase in training places, Mr Hunt will promise mothers that they will be seen by the same midwife throughout labour, pregnancy and birth by 2021. Appearing on ITV's Peston on Sunday, Mr Hunt said ""continuity of carers"" could potentially save 700 babies' lives a year and prevent a further 500 from being born with brain damage, but ""it needs more midwives"". He said: ""We know we need to make maternity care safer."" The maternity support worker role will also be developed with national set standards It is part of his ongoing ambition to make the NHS ""the safest place in the world to give birth"" and halve the rate of stillbirths, neonatal and maternal deaths and brain injuries during birth by 2025, the Department of Health said. Mr Hunt will also announce plans to develop the role of maternity support workers (MSW) by creating set national standards that they must adhere to. New training routes into midwifery will also be introduced. By Nick Triggle, BBC health correspondent Increasing student midwife numbers is the easy bit. As the government has scrapped the bursary for midwives, it is much less costly to the public purse to increase the number of places. Filling them when student midwives now have to pay fees may be another matter. But even if this is achieved, it doesn't guarantee the midwife workforce will grow. Over the last five years 7,700 newly-qualified midwives have joined the profession. But the numbers leaving - either because of retirement or, increasingly, quitting the NHS - reached 8,900. In fact, the only reason the workforce was able to increase over that period - by 1,500 to 22,500 - was because the NHS was able to recruit midwives from abroad. If the NHS cannot improve its ability to keep staff - and the pay deal announced last week is only likely to help to some extent - the rise in student numbers will have a limited impact. The Royal College of Midwivesestimates that services in England are 3,500 midwives short.,external Chief executive of the RCM, Gill Walton, called the latest move ""a very long overdue acknowledgement"" of the need for more midwives. ""This announcement must be welcomed,"" she said. ""It will come as some relief to NHS midwives who have been working incredibly hard, for many years, with increasing demands and inadequate resources."" But Ms Walton warned the measures were ""ambitious"" and would ""not transform maternity services right now"", adding the extra recruited midwives would not qualify until 2022. She added: ""Simply training more midwives is only half of the problem. Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning,external ""The other key issue is ensuring that when these midwives qualify they actually get jobs in the NHS. ""We must get a commitment from the government and trusts to employ them. ""Trusts are going to need an increase in the money they get so they can employ the new midwives."" Last year, the Department of Health scrapped its NHS bursary scheme for trainee nurses and midwives in England. It meant new students enrolling on most nursing and midwifery courses from August 2017 have to pay tuition fees like other students. I'm a man and a midwife. Are you OK with that?

Briton jailed for killing wife in Dubai,"Jane Matthew was hit twice on the head with a hammer The family of a British woman killed by her husband in Dubai says ""justice has not been done"" after he was jailed for 10 years. Francis Matthew killed his 62-year-old wife Jane by hitting her twice on the head with a hammer at their villa in the city, the Dubai Court of the First Instance heard. Matthew, 61, former editor of the Gulf News, had blamed the attack on robbers. The court said he would be deported after his sentence. He had initially been charged with premeditated murder which could have seen him get the death penalty but judges changed the charge to ""beating which led to death"",the Gulf News reported,external. Francis Mathew used to be editor of the Gulf News The couple had been arguing about money at their three-bedroom villa in the Jumeirah neighbourhood of Dubai - a city in the United Arab Emirates, on the Persian Gulf. The attack took place on 4 July 2017, the court heard. Mrs Matthew's family, who were in the court, said the crime was a ""deliberate act"", adding: ""Arguments about money can arise in any marriage and cannot justify this killing."" In a statement, they said they wanted his sentence increased on appeal. They said: ""Jane was a loving wife, mother, daughter, sister and aunt. ""Losing her in such a brutal manner has left the family both bewildered and shocked."" Matthew had edited the Gulf News between 1995 and 2005 and was the paper's editor-at-large at the time of the killing.

French town mourns attack victims,"The service was attended by the town's mayor Eric Menassi (c) and his wife Samia Menassi (r), director of Super U supermarket A memorial Mass has been celebrated in the southern French town of TrÃ¨bes, in honour of four people killed by an Islamist gunman on Friday. One of them, policeman Lt-Col Arnaud Beltrame, has been hailed as a hero for trading places with a captive during a siege at a supermarket. The bishop at the church told hundreds of mourners that his actions were comparable to that of a saint. It is the worst jihadist attack under Emmanuel Macron's presidency. The gunman, 25-year-old Redouane Lakdim, had been on an extremist watch list and was known to authorities as a petty criminal, but intelligence services had determined he did not pose a threat. He was shot dead by police. Lakdim, who pledged allegiance to Islamic State militants, was said to have demanded the release of Salah Abdeslam, the most important surviving suspect in the 13 November 2015 attacks in Paris, which killed 130 people. France approves tough new anti-terror laws Tributes paid for hostage-swap policeman Friends and families of the victims also attended the memorial In the packed Church of Saint-Etienne in TrÃ¨bes, the bishop of Carcassonne and Narbonne compared the police officer's actions with those of a Polish saint who volunteered to die in the place of a stranger at the World War Two death camp at Auschwitz. Mourners, which included members of the local Muslim community, lined the back and front steps of the church. ""Your presence tells us that the creators of hatred will not win,"" Bishop Alain Planet said to the Muslim congregates in his address. Outside the 14th-century church, the local imam later said according to the news agency AFP: ""The [Muslim] community has been stabbed, Islam itself has been stabbed... by people who use symbols that are dear to our hearts."" Mourners included Muslims from the nearby Carcassonne community The chief of French police, Richard Lizurey, attended the service and later told reporters that Col Beltrame was an inspiration to those working in the French security services. ""It's an heroic act. In fact an exceptional act, carried out in the heat of action,"" the head of the Gendarmerie said. ""We are proud. Proud to have counted Arnaud Beltrame among us."" The attack has shaken the rural town of 6,000 people, and flowers have been laid in front of the Super U shop where the hostage-taking took place, as well as outside Col Beltrame's police barracks. A separate national memorial in Paris will also honour the killed officer in the coming days. Khadija, a 52-year-old restaurant owner, said she was shocked by what had occurred. ""We thought this only happened in big towns,"" she told AFP. Churchgoers made their way through TV cameras Jean MaziÃ¨res Before the hostage-taking in TrÃ¨bes, Lakdim hijacked a car in nearby Carcassonne, shooting the Portuguese driver and killing passenger Jean MaziÃ¨res, a retired winemaker in his sixties. He organised villages fetes and was described as ""very jolly"" by Marc Rofes, the mayor of Villedubert, where his family lives. ""He loved life, he loved parties... we have lost someone who was liked by everybody,"" he said of Mr MaziÃ¨res, who was married and had one child. The driver of the car remains in a critical condition. This video can not be played Eye-witness says French hostage-taker ran after him Christian MedvÃ¨s After opening fire on a group of police officers out jogging, wounding one, the gunman drove to the Super U in TrÃ¨bes, where he killed the shop's chief butcher, Christian MedvÃ¨s. An amateur runner and one-time local political candidate, Mr MedvÃ¨s, 50, was described as having the ""joy of life"". ""We do not know yet what happened, but knowing Christian, I imagine he would have wanted to intervene,"" his friend Franck Alberti told local paper La DÃ©pÃªche du Midi. He was married with two daughters. HervÃ© Sosna Retired builder HervÃ© Sosna, 65, was at the butcher's counter when Lakdim mounted his assault. The TrÃ¨bes resident ""had a huge intellectual capacity"" and was a capacious reader, especially of poetry, his half-brother told La DÃ©pÃªche du Midi. ""He never asked for anything, and he was killed, just like that."" Arnaud Beltrame The brave police officer has emerged as the human face of this attack, and his actions are being seen as a defiant response to the country's would-be attackers - a reminder of the best of France, says BBC Paris correspondent Lucy Williamson. Although police managed to free hostages from the supermarket, Lakdim had held one woman back as a human shield, and Col Beltrame volunteered to swap himself for her. As he did so, he left his mobile phone on a table with an open line so that police outside could monitor the situation. When police heard gunshots, a tactical team stormed the supermarket. The gunman was killed and Col Beltrame, who was 44, was mortally wounded. He and his wife, Marielle, had been married in a civil ceremony but were planning a church wedding in June. The Catholic priest who was meant to officiate at the ceremony visited Col Beltrame in hospital, where Marielle was keeping vigil, before he died. World leaders, including UK PM Theresa May, have paid tribute to the officer, who was a highly-regarded member of the Gendarmerie Nationale and was described by President Macron on Saturday as someone who ""fought until the end and never gave up"". ""He gave his life for strangers. He must have known that he didn't really have a chance. If that doesn't make him a hero, I don't know what would,"" Col Beltrame's brother, Cedric, told a French radio station on Saturday. This video can not be played ""This was a heroic act"" on the part of the lieutenant-colonel, says Interior Minister GÃ©rard Collomb Speaking to the BBC, Col Arnaud's cousin Florence Nicolic described the officeras a person who was ""so good at his job"". ""Even though we were surprised and shocked when we heard what happened we were not surprised in the sense that that's the thing he would do without hesitation,"" Ms Nicolic said. Col Beltrame was deployed to Iraq in 2005 and was later awarded the Cross for Military Valour for his peacekeeping work. On his return to France, Col Beltrame joined the country's Republican Guard and was tasked with protecting the presidential palace. In 2017, he was named deputy chief of the Gendarmerie Nationale in the French region of Aude. Siege witness: He ran after me.

Russia shopping centre fire kills children,"This video can not be played Firefighters tackle fatal shopping centre fire At least 64 people have died in a fire that engulfed a shopping and entertainment complex in the Siberian coal-mining city of Kemerovo. Many of the victims are children. Ten people are still listed as missing. The blaze started on an upper floor of the Winter Cherry complex during school holidays. The mall's shops, cinema and bowling alley were packed at the time. Video posted on social media showed people jumping from windows to escape the flames. ""According to preliminary information, the roof collapsed in two cinemas,"" Russia's Investigative Committee said in a statement. The cause of the fire is not yet known. The authorities have launched an investigation. Four people have been detained for questioning, including the head of the company that manages the shopping centre, according to the Investigative Committee. The owner of the Winter Cherry complex is among those being held. The fire broke out at about 17:00 (10:00 GMT) on Sunday. Some 660 emergency personnel were deployed in the rescue effort. Firefighters said the building was still smouldering a day later, with smoke billowing out and the remaining structures at risk of collapse. The region's deputy governor Vladimir Chernov was quoted as saying the fire probably began in a children's trampoline room. ""The preliminary suspicion is that a child had a cigarette lighter which ignited foam rubber in this trampoline room, and it erupted like gunpowder,"" he said. However, Rossiya 24 TV, a national broadcaster, said an electrical fault was the most likely cause - as in most previous deadly fires in Russia. Russia's commissioner for children's rights, Anna Kuznetsova, has blamed negligence, and called for urgent safety checks at similar entertainment complexes. Firefighters had to be lifted to a great height to tackle the blaze Two witnesses told BBC Russian that they had seen the fire blazing in the trampoline room on the fourth floor but had not heard any fire alarm. Meanwhile, witness Anna Zarechneva told Russian RBC News that ""a woman burst into the cinema during the film and shouted 'Fire! Fire!', and we started running out"". ""The lights didn't come on in there to help us escape. We got out by following the floor lighting. But at that point no alarm bells were ringing. I only heard an alarm when I reached the first floor."" At least nine of the bodies found so far are children. As well as those killed, 11 injured victims are being treated in hospital, suffering from smoke inhalation. Smoke billowed from the building The most serious case is an 11-year-old boy whose parents and siblings died in the fire, Health Minister Veronika Skvortsova said. He reportedly fell from the fourth floor and is in intensive care with multiple injuries. An Instagram post from Kemerovo showed a big queue of volunteers waiting to donate blood at a clinic.

Kemerovo, a key coal-producing area, lies about 3,600km (2,200 miles) east of Moscow. The shopping centre, covering 23,000 sq m (248,000 sq ft), opened in 2013. It includes a petting zoo, all of whose animals are reported to have died. Yevgeny Dedyukhin, deputy head of the Kemerovo region emergency department, said the area of the fire was about 1,500 sq m. ""The shopping centre is a very complex construction,"" he said. ""There are a lot of combustible materials."" Russia factory fire leaves workers dead.

'Epidemic of low self-esteem for girls',"Jameela Jamil says there's an ""epidemic of low self-esteem"" for girls and women across the world because of social media. The actress and presenter has started a campaign called ""I Weigh"" to celebrate people's achievements rather than their weight. Jameela says she wants to inspire women not to focus on the way they look. ""Every minute we spend thinking about how thin and gorgeous and perfect we aren't, is a moment that we aren't thinking about growing our business or our education, or our family or the fun in our lives,"" she tells Newsbeat. She's not the first person to encourage people not to focus on their looks, but the 32-year-old says she's been a ""body positivity warrior"" for a long time, and especially since her days presenting the Official Chart Show on Radio 1. ""I'd gained 200,000 listeners which was great, and the papers on that day - instead of reporting that - reported that I'd gained two dress sizes and had loads of photographs fat shaming me and ridiculing my body,"" she says. But it was an Instagram account with hundreds of thousands of followers that inspired I Weigh, when it posted a picture of the Kardashian sisters next to how much they weighed. ""I just thought - why do we care so much about this? When women have come so far in life why are we still being told to care about this?"" Jameela's response turned out to be the start of I Weigh - which encourages people to post positive messages that don't relate to their appearance. Jameela's response led to I Weigh Women and girls looking at airbrushed and Photoshopped images on social media are who the account is primarily for. ""I'm hearing about eight-year-olds and nine-year-olds worried about their bodies and their thighs, and their thigh gaps. It's just out of control,"" Jameela says. ""At least before it used to just be celebrities, but now it's people trolling each other on Instagram, or glamorising being anorexic."" Allow Instagram content?

Suffolk MP cleared in misconduct probe,"The Central Suffolk and North Ipswich MP has ""vigorously"" denied the claims The Suffolk MP Daniel Poulter has been cleared over allegations of inappropriate behaviour towards female colleagues. Mr Poulter wasreferred to an internal disciplinary committeefollowing claims made to the Sunday Times in November. In a statement, the Conservative Party said a panel found there was ""insufficient evidence to support the complaint made against him"". Mr Poulter said he was ""pleased"", but ""entirely unsurprised"" at the findings. The MP for Central Suffolk and North Ipswich was placed under investigation after fellow Conservative MP Andrew Bridgen alleged that women had complained about being treated inappropriately by him. Dr Poulter (seated, centre) returned to the Commons in January to hear a bill reading Mr Poulter had been on sick leave butreturned to the Commons in January to hear a bill reading. He said: ""I am pleased although entirely unsurprised that, after five months, I have finally been exonerated of any misconduct or inappropriate behaviour. ""I appreciate that the committee left no stone unturned in investigating these unsubstantiated complaints against me."" He revealed legal action was under way against the Sunday newspaper. Mr Poulter added: ""The allegations brought against me were false and scurrilous. I have no idea why a fellow Conservative MP should have irresponsibly sought publicity by attaching his name to these claims in a newspaper article. ""The past five months have been incredibly difficult for me and have at times taken a considerable toll on my health. ""Nevertheless, I have continued to represent the people of Central Suffolk and North Ipswich and I fully intend to continue doing so."" A Conservative Party spokesman said: ""A thorough and impartial investigation of a complaint took place and a panel chaired by an independent QC found there was insufficient evidence to support the complaint.""

"Facebook boss apologises in newspaper adsFirm could have done more to stop data breach that affected ""millions"", Mark Zuckerberg says.1h36 minutes agoBusiness","""I'm sorry we didn't do more at the time,"" Mr Zuckerberg said Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg has taken out full-page adverts in several UK and US Sunday newspapers to apologise for the firm's recent data privacy scandal. He said Facebook could have done more to stop millions of users having their data exploited by political consultancy Cambridge Analytica in 2014. ""This was a breach of trust, and I am sorry,"" the back-page ads state. It comes amid reports Facebook was warned its data protection policies were too weak back in 2011. The full-page apology featured in broadsheets and tabloids in the UK, appearing on the back page of the Sunday Telegraph, Sunday Times, Mail on Sunday, Observer, Sunday Mirror and Sunday Express. In the US, it was seen by readers of the New York Times, Washington Post and Wall Street Journal. Facebook's Zuckerberg speaks out over Cambridge Analytica 'breach' Facebook boss summoned over data claims In the advert, Mr Zuckerberg said a quiz developed by a university researcher had ""leaked Facebook data of millions of people in 2014"". The ad appeared in papers such as the Sunday Telegraph and New York Times ""I'm sorry we didn't do more at the time. We're now taking steps to make sure this doesn't happen again,"" the tech chief said. It echoes comments Mr Zuckerberg made last week after reports of the leak prompted investigations in Europe and the US, and knockedbillions of dollars of Facebook's market value. Mr Zuckerberg repeated that Facebook had already changed its rules so no such breach could happen again. ""We're also investigating every single app that had access to large amounts of data before we fixed this. We expect there are others,"" he stated. ""And when we find them, we will ban them and tell everyone affected."" The ads contained no mention of the political consultancy accused of using the leaked data, Cambridge Analytica, which worked on US President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign. The British firm has denied wrongdoing. In 2014, Facebook invited users to find out their personality type via a quiz developed by Cambridge University researcher, Dr Alexsandr Kogan called This is Your Digital Life. About 270,000 users' data was collected, but the app also collected some public data from users' friends without their knowledge. Facebook has since changed the amount of data developers can gather in this way, but a whistleblower, Christopher Wylie, says the data of about 50 million people was harvested for Cambridge Analytica before the rules on user consent were tightened up. Mr Wylie claims the data was sold to Cambridge Analytica which then used it to psychologically profile people and deliver pro-Trump material to them during the 2016 US presidential election campaign. Facebook has said Dr Kogan passed this information on to Cambridge Analytica without its knowledge. And Cambridge Analytica has blamed Dr Kogan for any potential breach of data rules. But Dr Kogan has said he was told by Cambridge Analytica everything they had done was legal, and that he was being made a ""scapegoat"" by the firm and Facebook. As firstreported in the Sunday Telegraph,,externalIreland's Data Protection Commissioner (DPC) warned Facebook's security policies were too weak to stop abuse in 2011, some three years before the breach took place. Following an audit, the DPC said relying on developers to follow information rules in some cases was not good enough ""to ensure security of user data"". It also said Facebook processes to stop abuse were not strong enough to ""assure users of the security of their data once they have third party apps enabled"". Facebook said it strengthened its protections following the recommendations and was told it had addressed the DPC's original concerns aftera second audit,externalin 2012. The tech firm also said it changed its platform entirely in 2014 with the regulator's recommendations in mind. Zuckerberg speaks out on data breaches Cambridge Analytica: What we know so far.

""We strongly suspected that Peter Pickering was responsible for her murder. We had been liaising with the Crown Prosecution Service and it was our expectation that Pickering would be charged in due course. ""His unexpected death clearly means that will no longer happen."" In 1965 a major murder inquiry was launched after Elsie's body was found at the bottom of a flight of steps by a dog walker. In 2015 police launched a fresh appeal to find her killer. Elsie Frost, 14, was found dead by dog walker in Wakefield, in 1965 It came as a result ofthe BBC Radio 4 podcast series Who Killed Elsie Frost?which followed her brother Colin Frost and sister Anne Cleave as theysought justice for the schoolgirl. Mr Frost said hearing about Pickering's death felt ""like a hollow victory"". ""We really needed to see this man in court,"" he said. ""That day's been taken away from us. We've been really close, but it's not going to have the right ending now. ""When the detective rang me this morning, I laughed it off. But as the day's gone onâ¦ I'm almost speechless."" Colin Frost (pictured here in 2015) fought to get documents relating to the original murder investigation, including the inquest file Detectives said the rape Pickering was convicted of this week only came to light while they were investigating the murder of Elsie, who was stabbed in the back and head while walking through a railway tunnel, just off a canal towpath. The woman he raped, who cannot be named for legal reasons, told his trial she did not think she would have been believed if she had reported the attack in the 1970s. She was then persuaded by police to co-operate in 2016. During the rape trial, Leeds Crown Court heard Pickering had lured his victim into his van before driving to a secluded spot in 1972. Peter Pickering admitted the manslaughter by diminished responsibility of 14-year-old Shirley Boldy in 1972 He then subjected her to an ordeal that involved handcuffing her and burning her breasts with cigarettes. The woman told the jury: ""I remain of the fervent belief that whether he has a mental illness or not, the man is a monster and wherever he is now that's the right place for him to be."" Weeks after the rape, he abducted, raped, strangled and stabbed 14-year-old Shirley Boldy to death on her way home from school in Wombwell. He later admitted manslaughter by diminished responsibility the same year and has been in secure psychiatric hospitals, including Broadmoor. Most recently he had been detained at Thornford Park Hospital in Berkshire.

Large blaze breaks out at mill,"The fire has caused a partial collapse of Proofings Mill in Littleborough Firefighters have been tackling a large fire at a derelict mill, which has partially collapsed due to the blaze. Twelve properties were evacuated when Proofings Mill in Littleborough, Rochdale, caught fire, said Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue (GMFRS). Crews were called to the mill in Hare Hill Road at 16:30 GMT on Saturday and spent all night tackling the flames, which are not fully extinguished. David Roach from GMFRS said crews were ""struggling to reach"" pockets of fire. The industrial building in Rochdale has become unstable, GMFRS said ""Due to the instability of the building, we are unable to enter and are fighting the fire from outside of the mill,"" he said. He advised people to avoid the area and keep windows and doors shut because ""the incident is still ongoing"" and ""there is still light smoke coming from the fire"".

Vote Leave 'broke spending limits'Brexit activist Shahmir Sanni claims the campaign used the group BeLeave to bypass spending limits.1han hour agoUK Politics,"Shahmir Sanni told Channel 4 News that the official Brexit campaign used a different group, BeLeave, to overspend Vote Leave broke the law during the EU referendum by exceeding legal spending limits, a Brexit activist has claimed. Shahmir Sanni told Channel 4 News,externalthat the official Brexit campaign used a different group, BeLeave, to overspend. Vote Leave chief Dominic Cummings has already denied the claim and said he checked with the Electoral Commission before donating money to the group. Mr Sanni has also criticised Vote Leave manager Stephen Parkinson, his ex-boyfriend, for outing him as gay. ""I know that, that Vote Leave cheatedâ¦ I know that, that people have been lied to and that the referendum wasn't legitimate,"" Mr Sanni told Channel 4 News. ""Leaving the European Union, I agree with. ""But I don't agree with losing what it means to be British in that process; losing what it means to follow the rules; losing what it means to be quite literally a functioning democracy."" Electoral Commission reopens Vote Leave probe The Electoral Commission is already looking into whether Vote Leave spent more than it was entitled to during the campaign. Brexit Secretary David Davis told the BBC it was the job of the commission, not ministers, to make a judgement, while foreign secretary and Vote Leave frontman Boris Johnson dismissed the claims as ""utterly ludicrous"". Labour's Tom Watson said that ""if needs be"" the police should investigate too. Mr Sanni told the Observer,externalthat Vote Leave donated Â£625,000 to the founder of BeLeave, Darren Grimes, before the June 2016 referendum. Vote Leave would have gone over its campaign spending limit of Â£7m if it had spent the money. Mr Sanni claimed Mr Grimes was not in control of how the money from Vote Leave was spent and everything they did they passed through ground campaign manager Mr Parkinson - who is now the prime minister's political secretary. He told the newspaper that most of the donation went to Canadian data firm Aggregate IQ, which has been linked to Cambridge Analytica - the firm facing claims it amassed the data of millions of people without their consent. Mr Sanni said he and two other pro-Brexit friends reported the overspending allegation to the Electoral Commission on Thursday. Vote Leave chief denies Cambridge Analytica links Cummings hits out ""In effect they used BeLeave to overspend, and not just by a small amountâ¦ Almost two thirds of a million pounds makes all the difference and it wasn't legal,"" said Mr Sanni, who first worked as a Vote Leave outreach volunteer before working for BeLeave. ""They say that it wasn't coordinated, but it was. And so the idea thatâ¦ the campaign was legitimate is false."" Speaking on BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend, Mr Sanni said his lawyers would be presenting ""recommendations to MPs"" at a news conference in London on Monday. Vote Leave has previously said it made the donation to Mr Grimes because it was coming up to its Â£7m spending limit and wanted a way of using the Â£9.2m it had raised from individuals and companies on campaigning activities. The campaign separately spent Â£2.7m on the services of AIQ in the run-up to the EU referendum. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

He said he was ""saddened"" by the ""factually incorrect and misleading"" statements from Mr Sanni, who now works for the Taxpayer's Alliance.

"Facebook boss apologises in newspaper adsFirm could have done more to stop data breach that affected ""millions"", Mark Zuckerberg says.4m4 minutes agoBusiness","""I'm sorry we didn't do more at the time,"" Mr Zuckerberg said Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg has taken out full-page adverts in several UK and US Sunday newspapers to apologise for the firm's recent data privacy scandal. He said Facebook could have done more to stop millions of users having their data exploited by political consultancy Cambridge Analytica in 2014. ""This was a breach of trust, and I am sorry,"" the back-page ads state. It comes amid reports Facebook was warned its data protection policies were too weak back in 2011. The full-page apology featured in broadsheets and tabloids in the UK, appearing on the back page of the Sunday Telegraph, Sunday Times, Mail on Sunday, Observer, Sunday Mirror and Sunday Express. In the US, it was seen by readers of the New York Times, Washington Post and Wall Street Journal. Facebook's Zuckerberg speaks out over Cambridge Analytica 'breach' Facebook boss summoned over data claims In the advert, Mr Zuckerberg said a quiz developed by a university researcher had ""leaked Facebook data of millions of people in 2014"". The ad appeared in papers such as the Sunday Telegraph and New York Times ""I'm sorry we didn't do more at the time. We're now taking steps to make sure this doesn't happen again,"" the tech chief said. It echoes comments Mr Zuckerberg made last week after reports of the leak prompted investigations in Europe and the US, and knockedbillions of dollars of Facebook's market value. Mr Zuckerberg repeated that Facebook had already changed its rules so no such breach could happen again. ""We're also investigating every single app that had access to large amounts of data before we fixed this. We expect there are others,"" he stated. ""And when we find them, we will ban them and tell everyone affected."" The ads contained no mention of the political consultancy accused of using the leaked data, Cambridge Analytica, which worked on US President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign. The British firm has denied wrongdoing. In 2014, Facebook invited users to find out their personality type via a quiz developed by Cambridge University researcher, Dr Alexsandr Kogan called This is Your Digital Life. About 270,000 users' data was collected, but the app also collected some public data from users' friends without their knowledge. Facebook has since changed the amount of data developers can gather in this way, but a whistleblower, Christopher Wylie, says the data of about 50 million people was harvested for Cambridge Analytica before the rules on user consent were tightened up. Mr Wylie claims the data was sold to Cambridge Analytica which then used it to psychologically profile people and deliver pro-Trump material to them during the 2016 US presidential election campaign. Facebook has said Dr Kogan passed this information on to Cambridge Analytica without its knowledge. And Cambridge Analytica has blamed Dr Kogan for any potential breach of data rules. But Dr Kogan has said he was told by Cambridge Analytica everything they had done was legal, and that he was being made a ""scapegoat"" by the firm and Facebook. As firstreported in the Sunday Telegraph,,externalIreland's Data Protection Commissioner (DPC) warned Facebook's security policies were too weak to stop abuse in 2011, some three years before the breach took place. Following an audit, the DPC said relying on developers to follow information rules in some cases was not good enough ""to ensure security of user data"". It also said Facebook processes to stop abuse were not strong enough to ""assure users of the security of their data once they have third party apps enabled"". Facebook said it strengthened its protections following the recommendations and was told it had addressed the DPC's original concerns aftera second audit,externalin 2012. The tech firm also said it changed its platform entirely in 2014 with the regulator's recommendations in mind. Zuckerberg speaks out on data breaches Cambridge Analytica: What we know so far.

Corbyn 'right to express mural regret',"This video can not be played Watson: ""I am very, very sorry that people feel hurt by this"" Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson says Jeremy Corbyn was right to express regret for sending an apparently supportive message to the creator of an allegedly anti-Semitic mural. Jeremy Corbyn faced criticism over his initial response to a Facebook post by street artist Mear One in 2012. He later called the mural ""deeply disturbing"" and backed its removal. Mr Watson also apologised personally for any hurt that had been caused by his leader's comments. Corbyn 'regret' over anti-Semitic mural row In October 2012, Mear One posted a picture of his mural in east London called ""Freedom of Humanity"" on Facebook, with the words: ""Tomorrow they want to buff my mural. Freedom of expression. London calling. Public Art."" Mr Corbyn replied: ""Why? You are in good company. Rockerfeller destroyed Diego [Rivera's] mural because it includes a picture of Lenin."" More recently, Labour MP Luciana Berger sought clarification from the leader's office on the 2012 comments - made three years before Mr Corbyn became the party's leader. Mr Corbyn said: ""I sincerely regret that I did not look more closely at the image I was commenting on, the contents of which are deeply disturbing and anti-Semitic. ""I am opposed to the production of anti-Semitic material of any kind, and the defence of free speech cannot be used as a justification for the promotion of anti-Semitism in any form."" Mear One - whose real name is Kalen Ockerman - has denied being anti-Semitic, saying the mural was about ""class and privilege"". Allow Twitter content?

Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, Mr Watson was shown the mural and asked for his reaction to it. ""My reaction is that is a horrible anti-Semitic mural that was rightly taken down,"" he said. But he defended his leader - who said he regretted he ""did not look more closely at the image"" before commenting online - adding: ""You are showing it to me on a 32-inch screen on national television and I have seen it about 100 times on social media. ""It's very different from seeing it on Facebook when you are on the move."" Mr Watson said Mr Corbyn had made his comment in regards to freedom of expression, but apologised for any offence caused. ""I am very, very sorry that people feel hurt by this and that is why I think it is right that Jeremy has expressed regret for it,"" said Mr Watson. The deputy leader added that it was time Labour said ""enough is enough"" and they would ""work harder to stamp out anti-Semitism"" in the party. Jeremy Corbyn says he ""wholeheartedly supported"" the removal of the mural in east London Shadow Brexit Secretary Keir Starmer said the mural was ""grotesque and disgusting"" but Mr Corbyn had given his explanation for his online comment. He told ITV's Peston on Sunday: ""The most important thing here is that the Labour Party keeps on saying that anti-semitism has no place in our party, in our communities, or in our society. ""We've got to have zero tolerance, and zero tolerance has got to be more than two words. It's got to dictate everything the Labour Party does in relation to anti-Semitism."" Shadow transport secretary Andy McDonald told Sky News that Mr Corbyn ""hasn't got an anti-Semitic bone in his body"" and that the row had ""misinterpreted the intentions of a really good and decent man"". But Ms Berger called Mr Corbyn's response ""wholly inadequate"". Shetweeted,external:  ""It fails to understand on any level the hurt and anguish felt about Anti-Semitism.

And rather than facing up, Jeremy Corbyn has chosen to dissemble to defend himself. ""It is simply not credible to suggest that a man with his knowledge of foreign affairs did not recognise those images for what they were.

Firm in data scandal 'made election boasts',"A brochure suggests the parent company of scandal-hit data firm Cambridge Analytica boasted of interfering in Nigeria's 2007 election - widely dismissed as lacking credibility The company that became Cambridge Analytica boasted about interfering in foreign elections, according to documents seen by the BBC. Cambridge Analytica is embroiled in a storm over claims it exploited the data of millions of Facebook users. The BBC has seen a brochure published by parent company SCL Elections, it is believed prior to 2014. It claims, for instance, that it organised rallies in Nigeria to weaken support for the opposition in 2007. The UK Foreign Office says it was unaware of this alleged activity before SCL was awarded British government contracts in 2008. Cambridge Analytica says it is looking into the allegations about SCL. Speaking on the Sunday Politics show, Conservative former International Development Secretary Andrew Mitchell said the claims about SCL were ""absolutely appalling"" and ""run totally counter to the policy of the British government in promoting free and fair elections in the developing world"". He added that it is ""perfectly clear that the British government should have nothing to do with it"". Cambridge Analytica: The story so far The data firm's global influence In the document, SCL Elections claimed potential clients could contact the company through ""any British High Commission or Embassy"". It also claims SCL received ""List X"" accreditation from the UK's Ministry of Defence which provided ""Government endorsed clearance to handle information protectively marked as 'confidential' and above"". The brochure outlines how SCL Elections had apparently organised ""anti-election rallies"" to dissuade opposition supporters from voting in the Nigerian presidential election in 2007. Theelection was described by EU monitors as one of the least credible,externalthey had observed. The document claims SCL Elections deliberately exploited ethnic tensions in Latvia in the 2006 national elections in order to help their client. SCL also claims that ahead of the elections in Trinidad and Tobago in 2010, it orchestrated an ""ambitious campaign of political graffiti"" that ""ostensibly came from the youth"" so the client party could ""claim credit for listening to a 'united youth'"". Most of the examples detailed in the brochure took place before the British government entered into at least six contracts with SCL. This video can not be played Cambridge Analytica: What we know so far The former Labour Foreign Office Minister and Cabinet minister Lord Hain has tabled a written question in the House of Lords on Monday for urgent clarification on the matter of Embassy endorsement. He said the SCL case was ""lifting the lid on a potential horror story"" of other companies using data to manipulate voters. The Ministry of Defence has confirmed SLC were given a provisional List X accreditation but had not had it since 2013. A Foreign Office spokesperson said: ""It is not now nor ever has been the case that enquiries for SCL 'can be directed through any British High Commission or Embassy'."" ""Our understanding is that, at the time of the signing of the contract for project work in 2008/9, the FCO was not aware of SCL's reported activity during the 2006 Latvian election or 2007 Nigerian election."" In a statement, the acting CEO of Cambridge Analytica, Dr Alexander Tayler, said ""Cambridge Analytica was formed in 2013, out of a much older company called SCL Elections. ""We take the disturbing recent allegations of unethical practices in our non-US political business very seriously. The board has launched a full and independent investigation into SCL Elections' past practices, and its findings will be made available in due course.""

'Doctors learn nothing about nutrition',"The health effects of nutrition and diet are not part of traditional training for medical students Medical students say they currently learn almost nothing about the way diet and lifestyle affect health - and they should be taught more. They say what they are taught is not practical or relevant to most of the medical problems they see in GP surgeries, clinics and hospitals. A leading GP estimated that up to 80% of his patients had conditions linked to lifestyle and diet. These included obesity, type 2 diabetes and depression. Why does this lack of training matter? This year the NHS will spend more than Â£11bn on diabetes alone - social care costs, time off work etc, will almost double that bill. Type 2 diabetes - the most common kind - is linked to obesity. And right now Britain is the fat man of Europe. But doctors are not being trained to deal with what medics call non-communicable diseases - and it's those kind of illnesses that are threatening to bankrupt our health system, so a new kind of training is crucial. Speaking toBBC Radio 4's The Food Programme,Dr Rangan Chatterjee,author,externalandpodcast host,external, told me: ""The health landscape of the UK has dramatically changed over the last 30 or 40 years and I think the bulk of what I see as a GP now - almost 80% - is in some way driven by our collective lifestyles."" The ball started rolling at the end of 2016 when cardiologist Dr Aseem Malhotra and a number of other leading doctors including Rangan Chatterjeewrote to the General Medical Council, the health secretary and the Medical Schools Council,externalcalling for all medical students and practising doctors to be trained in ""evidence based lifestyle interventions"". Dr Michael Mosley, presenter of BBC One's Trust Me I'm A Doctor, said, ""Unfortunately it's not part of the traditional training. At medical school I learnt almost nothing about nutrition. And I have a son at medical school and it's again not part of his key curriculum. ""So I don't get the sense that there are lots of doctors out there who feel empowered to tell patients much about nutrition."" Top five celeb diets to avoid in 2018, according to dieticians How food can improve your mental health Millennials 'set to be fattest generation' Rise in cancer 'caused by weight' A hotbed of the new revolution is Bristol University where, in 2017, third year medical students Ally Jaffee and Iain Broadley foundedNutritank,external. It's an online organisation created for and by medical students to share nutrition science research and organises events and lectures on campus. This summer, it will welcome GP, author andpodcast host Dr Rupy Aujla,externalto Bristol to lead the first UK course in culinary medicine for medical students. From one society in Bristol, Nutritank has now spread to 15 other student-led groups at universities across the country. Ally Jaffee said: ""There's just about a society at medical school in everything from sexual health to orthopaedics to dermatology. But there just wasn't a nutrition and lifestyle or a preventative medicine society. ""We're taught about 10 to 24 hours over five to six years in medical school on nutrition."" This month, the British Medical Journal announced it will launch a journal on the science and politics of nutrition in June 2018. Dr Fiona Godlee, editor-in-chief of the BMJ, told me, ""It's time we recognised that food and nutrition are core to health. There is a growing body of research out there that needs to be published - and we want to contribute to that effort."" What people eat has a bearing on their general health, doctors say She said the same levels of quality and scrutiny should be applied to food science that are applied to other areas of health research. The BMJ's announcement followsan opinion piece it published in October 2017 written by two University of Cambridge graduate medical students,,externalKate Womersley and Katherine Ripullone. Kate said: ""I was in an obesity clinic as part of my medical shadowing. ""A patient came in and said very frankly to the doctor, the consultant in charge, 'Why am I so fat?'. ""The patient was asking a very straightforward question and I think was expecting a straightforward answer. But often that's a question where doctors seem to clam up a bit. ""We were interested to write this piece for the BMJ, because we didn't feel prepared to be receiving that question."" Pay rise agreed for 1.3 million NHS staff Mums' Down's syndrome video goes viral What it's like to hear voices Medical schools in the UK are responsible for setting their own curriculum with guidance and standards published by the General Medical Council. The GMC is now reviewing that guidance but so far it's been very general. It told us that it recognises the significance of the impact of diet and nutrition on health and wellbeing and has sought to express this more explicitly in its revised ""outcomes"" that will be released this summer. Things are also beginning to change at medical schools. University of Cambridge told us it plans to double the amount of core course content on nutrition and has asked Kate and Katherine to help. Similarly, Bristol medical school has sought input from students to redesign its curriculum. Meanwhile, Prof Sumantra Ray of NNedPro Global Centre for Nutrition and Health told us his organisation is involved in rolling out training in diet and nutrition for student doctors by 2020. Kate said: ""Students need to see nutrition as something at the cutting edge of scientific discovery. ""I think there needs to be an image change of how doctors perceive nutrition, but also how it's presented to students.""

Cricketers step down over ball-tampering row,"Steve Smith (right) will miss the fourth Test against South Africa while the ICC says it hopes Cameron Bancroft (left) has learned from his mistake Australia captain Steve Smith has been banned for one match and fined his entire match fee by cricket's world governing body for his part in a ball-tampering incident in South Africa. Smith saidthe team's ""leadership group"" had a plan, carried out by Cameron Bancroft, to tamper with the ball to ""get an advantage"". Smith, 28, will now miss the fourth and final Test of the series. Bancroft, 25, was fined 75% of his match fee and got three demerit points. Smith admitted a charge of conduct ""of a serious nature that is contrary to the spirit of the game"",said a statement,externalfrom the International Cricket Council (ICC). ""As captain, Steve Smith must take full responsibility for the actions of his players and it is appropriate that he be suspended,"" said ICC chief executive David Richardson. Hours later, the Australians lost 10 wickets in the final session of day four to lose the third Test by 322 runs. Chasing a target of 430, they reached 47-0 at tea but were all out for 107. Smith had made one when he top-edged Kagiso Rabada for six, but soon departed for seven. South Africa fast bowler Morne Morkel, who willretire from international cricketat the end of the series, took the final wicket to finish with 5-23 as the hosts took a 2-1 series lead.

Smith said after play it was a ""big mistake"" but that he would not stand down. Cricket Australia (CA) has begun an investigation into the actions of its team, which Australia's prime minister Malcolm Turnbull said had ""shocked and bitterly disappointed"" him. ""The game needs to have a hard look at itself,"" added ICC chief Richardson. ""The ICC needs to do more to prevent poor behaviour and better police the spirit of the game, defining more clearly what is expected of players and enforcing the regulations in a consistent fashion. ""In addition, and most importantly, member countries need to show more accountability for their teams' conduct. ""Winning is important but not at the expense of the spirit of the game which is intrinsic and precious to the sport of cricket. We have to raise the bar across all areas."" Former England batsman Kevin Pietersen gives his view on the positions of Australia coach Darren Lehmann and his assistant David Saker Batsman Bancroft admitted ""changing the condition of the ball in breach of clause 41.3"" and accepted his punishment from Andy Pycroft, who is on the elite panel of ICC match referees. ""To carry a foreign object on to the field of play with the intention of changing the condition of the ball to gain an unfair advantage over your opponent is against not only the laws, but the spirit of the game as well,"" said Pycroft. ""That said, I acknowledge Cameron has accepted responsibility for his actions by pleading guilty to the charge and apologising publicly. ""As a young player starting out in international cricket, I hope the lessons learned from this episode will strongly influence the way he plays the game during the rest of his career."" Players who accumulate four demerit points in a two-year period receive a one-match ban, while those who get eight in the same 24-month period are banned for two matches. Neither Smith nor Bancroft had any demerit points on their records before this incident. Prior to the start of the fourth day's play, CA chief executive James Sutherland said Smith and David Warner had ""agreed to stand down as captain and vice-captain respectively for the remainder of this Test match"". Wicketkeeper Tim Paine was appointed acting captain for the rest of the match, though Smith and Warner continued to play. ""This Test match needs to proceed, and in the interim we will continue to investigate this matter with the urgency that it demands,"" added Sutherland.

""It seems beyond belief the Australian cricket team have been involved in cheating. Our cricketers are role models and cricket is synonymous with fair play.

Turnbull later added: ""I have spoken with David Peever, the chairman of Cricket Australia, and I have expressed to him very clearly and unequivocally my disappointment and concern. He has said to me that Cricket Australia will be responding decisively, as they should. ""It's their responsibility to deal with it, but I have to say that the whole nation, who hold those who wear the baggy green up on a pedestal - about as high as you can get in Australia, certainly higher than any politician, that's for sure - this is a shocking disappointment."" Umpires have the power to change the ball and award five penalty runs to the batting side if they feel it has been altered illegally - although they did not do so in this case Bancroft has been punished by the ICC for attempting to change the condition of the ball - which is prohibited byLaw 41.3.,external Roughing up one side of the ball can help the fielding side achieve ""reverse swing"" - in which the ball moves in the opposite direction to conventional swing, which is achieved by polishing one side of the ball. There are several methods by which the ball can be deliberately roughed up - ranging from the outright illegal (scuffing it with a bottle top, or scratching with fingernails), to those which are frowned upon but frequently take place anyway, such as throwing the ball into the stumps on the bounce, or applying saliva after sucking sugary sweets. Polishing the ball on your clothing is allowed if no artificial substance is used, as is drying a wet ball with a towel that has been approved by the umpires, or removing mud from the ball under an umpire's supervision. The umpire's ultimate sanction, if they feel the ball has been altered illegally, is to change the ball and award five penalty runs to the batting side - although this did not take place in Cape Town.

We don't need to cheat to beat anyone."" Clarke retired from international cricket in 2015 after suffering with a chronic back problem for many years, but when asked whether he would consider a shock return if Smith were to depart, he replied: ""If I was asked by the right people, then I would think about my answer.""

It was hugely disappointing."" Vaughan and Maxwell have commentated for Test Match Special together Former England captainMichael Vaughancriticised the ""pathetic penalties"" handed down to Smith and Bancroft. In a series of tweets, Vaughan said: ""Surely this moment was the time to set a precedent. All the team should be penalised."" This video can not be played Swann critical of 'friendless' Australia The South Africa-Australia series had already contained several flashpoints before the sides arrived in Cape Town for the third Test. Warner had to be restrained by team-mates during an off-field altercation with Proteas wicketkeeper Quinton de Kock during the first Test in Durban, for whichboth players were fined by the ICC and given demerit points. South Africa pace bowler Rabada was thenhanded a two-match suspensionafter deliberately brushing shoulders with Smith after celebrating his dismissal in the second Test at Port Elizabeth, butwon an appealto reduce his punishment to one demerit point rather than two, meaning he avoided a ban but remains one point away from it being triggered. Australia coach Darren Lehmann then hit out at what he described as""disgraceful"" verbal abusetowards his side in the early stages of the Cape Town Test. ""The Australian team have been playing under a siege mentality,"" ABC commentator Adam Collins told BBC Test Match Special. ""Lehmann had complained about the treatment the players have been getting - they are furious about what has happened in the last couple of weeks. Steve Smith is not a bad bloke. There is something else going on here. ""But the response on social media is very strong. It is trending against Steve Smith - it's not as if people are defending him. Smith knows he is in a lot of trouble. ""Australian fans would rather see their team lose than win like this."" BBC cricket correspondent Jonathan Agnew Ball-tampering has always happened in cricket but it's exceptionally difficult to prove. This time they have someone who has admitted his guilt - he's a captain, the act was premeditated and, worst of all, he has clearly coerced the most inexperienced player in his team to go out and do the dirty work for them, and that's awful. Australia have very few friends in cricket at the moment. The boorish way in which they've behaved over the years hasn't helped. The current series between Australia and South Africa has been ill-tempered. There's been bad blood about the way the Australians play the game. Many in the cricket world will feel a sense of satisfaction today about what they'll see as chickens coming home to roost. I really think this is an opportunity for the Australian authorities to look very carefully at their game. Smith made his Test debut against Pakistan in 2010, in a neutral series played in England The blond quiff has flattened and darkened somewhat over the years, and on the field Steve Smith is almost unrecognisable from the raw 21-year-old who made his Test debut against Pakistan at Lord's in July 2010. Selected primarily for his leg-spin bowling, Smith made one and 12 batting at number eight and nine in that game. He made two half-centuries in his first 10 Test innings, but was dropped after Australia lost the 2010-11 Ashes to England. His bowling was - and remains - wildly inconsistent, and doubts about his unorthodox batting technique meant he was out of the Test side for two years. But on his return, he slowly became such an integral part of the side that at 26, he was the natural successor to Clarke as captain in 2015, while his batting statistics soared to the point where hesitantcomparisons were drawn with Australia legend Sir Donald Bradman. Passing the 1,000-run mark in the past four calendar years, he was at the top of his game in the 2017-18 Ashes against England, hitting a career-best 239 as skipper at Perth to regain the urn, and averaging an incredible 137.40 across the five Tests to sit at the top of the ICC's batting rankings. Yet his rise has not been without controversy. In March 2017, India were angered afterSmith looked up to the dressing roomwhile pondering whether to review an lbw decision - contrary to ICC regulations that outlaw off-field assistance. And his Australia side's behaviour has been increasingly questioned, with senior Australian radio commentator Jim Maxwell commenting: ""I've started to become more and more offended by the arrogance of some of the players in the way they behave."" Australia came into the series against South Africa on the back of a convincing 4-0 victory on home soil over England, who are involved in a two-Test series in New Zealand. England bowler Stuart Broad says he did not sense anything untoward in the defeat in Australia but says it is ""strange"" Smith's side changed their approach in South Africa. ""We played five Ashes Tests and they reversed it in pretty much all of them, and ondrop-in pitches,"",externalsaid Broad. ""So to then change their method on a tour to South Africa in the third Test match seems a slightly strange one."" He added: ""There were occasions when they we reverse swinging it when we didn't find the means to be able to do that. We just class that down to home conditions. ""We move the ball differently to different teams in England, and Australia moved it better than we did and out-bowled us in Australia. That's how we saw it. ""Steve has come out and said it's the first time they've ever tried it and we have to believe his words."" Meanwhile, the social media world has picked up on a tweet Bancroft sent in 2013 - with England women's spinner Alex Hartley among those to notice.

Listen: BBC Radio 5 live In Short - Gilchrist says Australia are a 'laughing stock' Renowned Australian cricket commentatorJim Maxwellgot emotional talking on ABC Grandstand about the ball-tampering issue at the start of the fourth day. ""I do not remember being as disappointed in an Australian team as I feel and I know a number of Australians and colleagues would feel at the moment,"" he said. ""It was so blatant and stupid. It was hugely disappointing."" Vaughan and Maxwell have commentated for Test Match Special together Former England captainMichael Vaughancriticised the ""pathetic penalties"" handed down to Smith and Bancroft. In a series of tweets, Vaughan said: ""Surely this moment was the time to set a precedent. All the team should be penalised."" This video can not be played Swann critical of 'friendless' Australia The South Africa-Australia series had already contained several flashpoints before the sides arrived in Cape Town for the third Test. Warner had to be restrained by team-mates during an off-field altercation with Proteas wicketkeeper Quinton de Kock during the first Test in Durban, for whichboth players were fined by the ICC and given demerit points. South Africa pace bowler Rabada was thenhanded a two-match suspensionafter deliberately brushing shoulders with Smith after celebrating his dismissal in the second Test at Port Elizabeth, butwon an appealto reduce his punishment to one demerit point rather than two, meaning he avoided a ban but remains one point away from it being triggered. Australia coach Darren Lehmann then hit out at what he described as""disgraceful"" verbal abusetowards his side in the early stages of the Cape Town Test. ""The Australian team have been playing under a siege mentality,"" ABC commentator Adam Collins told BBC Test Match Special. ""Lehmann had complained about the treatment the players have been getting - they are furious about what has happened in the last couple of weeks. Steve Smith is not a bad bloke. There is something else going on here. ""But the response on social media is very strong. It is trending against Steve Smith - it's not as if people are defending him. Smith knows he is in a lot of trouble. ""Australian fans would rather see their team lose than win like this."" BBC cricket correspondent Jonathan Agnew Ball-tampering has always happened in cricket but it's exceptionally difficult to prove. This time they have someone who has admitted his guilt - he's a captain, the act was premeditated and, worst of all, he has clearly coerced the most inexperienced player in his team to go out and do the dirty work for them, and that's awful. Australia have very few friends in cricket at the moment. The boorish way in which they've behaved over the years hasn't helped. The current series between Australia and South Africa has been ill-tempered. There's been bad blood about the way the Australians play the game. Many in the cricket world will feel a sense of satisfaction today about what they'll see as chickens coming home to roost. I really think this is an opportunity for the Australian authorities to look very carefully at their game. Smith made his Test debut against Pakistan in 2010, in a neutral series played in England The blond quiff has flattened and darkened somewhat over the years, and on the field Steve Smith is almost unrecognisable from the raw 21-year-old who made his Test debut against Pakistan at Lord's in July 2010. Selected primarily for his leg-spin bowling, Smith made one and 12 batting at number eight and nine in that game. He made two half-centuries in his first 10 Test innings, but was dropped after Australia lost the 2010-11 Ashes to England. His bowling was - and remains - wildly inconsistent, and doubts about his unorthodox batting technique meant he was out of the Test side for two years. But on his return, he slowly became such an integral part of the side that at 26, he was the natural successor to Clarke as captain in 2015, while his batting statistics soared to the point where hesitantcomparisons were drawn with Australia legend Sir Donald Bradman. Passing the 1,000-run mark in the past four calendar years, he was at the top of his game in the 2017-18 Ashes against England, hitting a career-best 239 as skipper at Perth to regain the urn, and averaging an incredible 137.40 across the five Tests to sit at the top of the ICC's batting rankings. Yet his rise has not been without controversy. In March 2017, India were angered afterSmith looked up to the dressing roomwhile pondering whether to review an lbw decision - contrary to ICC regulations that outlaw off-field assistance. And his Australia side's behaviour has been increasingly questioned, with senior Australian radio commentator Jim Maxwell commenting: ""I've started to become more and more offended by the arrogance of some of the players in the way they behave."" Australia came into the series against South Africa on the back of a convincing 4-0 victory on home soil over England, who are involved in a two-Test series in New Zealand. England bowler Stuart Broad says he did not sense anything untoward in the defeat in Australia but says it is ""strange"" Smith's side changed their approach in South Africa. ""We played five Ashes Tests and they reversed it in pretty much all of them, and ondrop-in pitches,"",externalsaid Broad. ""So to then change their method on a tour to South Africa in the third Test match seems a slightly strange one."" He added: ""There were occasions when they we reverse swinging it when we didn't find the means to be able to do that. We just class that down to home conditions. ""We move the ball differently to different teams in England, and Australia moved it better than we did and out-bowled us in Australia. That's how we saw it. ""Steve has come out and said it's the first time they've ever tried it and we have to believe his words."" Meanwhile, the social media world has picked up on a tweet Bancroft sent in 2013 - with England women's spinner Alex Hartley among those to notice.

Former Catalan president 'detained',"Independence supporters have gathered in Barcelona to protest against the arrest Catalonia's ex-leader Carles Puigdemont has been detained by German police acting on a European arrest warrant. Mr Puigdemont, who is wanted in Spain for sedition and rebellion, was held crossing from Denmark on the way to Belgium, his lawyer said. Mr Puigdemont will appear before a German judge on Monday. The ex-leader's supporters gathered in Barcelona to protest against his arrest. The charges he faces in Spain could result in 30 years in prison. Mr Puigdemont has been living in self-imposed exile in Belgium since Catalonia's parliament unilaterally declared independence from Spain in October. He was visiting Finland last week when the arrest warrant against him was reissued, and he slipped out of the country on Friday before Finnish authorities could arrest him. He is spending the night in a prison in the north German town of Neumuenster. His court appearance on Monday will be a formality to confirm his identity. Afterwards a decision will be made about whether he will remain in custody while the extradition order is being processed. The man who wants to break up Spain Catalan crisis in 300 words German police said that Mr Puigdemont was detained by a highway patrol in the northern state of Schleswig-Holstein, which borders Denmark. After the news of his arrest broke on Sunday, thousands of demonstrators poured on to the streets of Barcelona. Scuffles break out between police and protesters in Barcelona They chanted ""Freedom for the political prisoners"" and ""This Europe is shameful!"" as they headed to the offices of the European Commission and the German consulate. A smaller protest was held in Girona, where Mr Puigdemont once served as mayor. Tensions in Catalonia are very high and its separatist leaders abandoned plans to name a new president following the arrest of the latest candidate, Jordi Turull, on Friday. Protesters clashed with police in Barcelona on Friday night after Spain's Supreme Court ruled 25 Catalan leaders should be tried for rebellion, embezzlement or disobeying the state. Mr Turull was among five people taken into custody in fresh arrests. The rulings were considered the most serious challenge to date to the Catalan independence movement. Almost the entire leadership now faces a major legal fight. This video can not be played Police clashed with protesters in Barcelona on Friday Following the referendum, the central government in Madrid sacked the Catalan regional government, imposed direct rule and called new elections but pro-independence parties returned with a slim majority. International warrants for Mr Puigdemont and other Catalan leaders were withdrawn in December by a Spanish judge, who said they had shown a willingness to return to the country. The warrants were reissued on Friday, surprising Mr Puigdemont, who had been in Finland to give a university lecture. Among those also wanted is Catalonia's former education minister, Clara Ponsati. She is in Scotland, where she has a position at the University of St Andrews, and saysshe is willing to hand herself in. Mr Puigdemont is wanted in Spain on charges of rebellion and sedition Carles Puigdemont, 55, is a former journalist who worked for pro-independence media in Catalonia and headed the Catalan News Agency. After moving to politics, he became an MP and later mayor of Girona, north-east of Barcelona. In 2016, he became leader of Catalonia and led the region to the referendum the following year. During his self-imposed exile following the resulting crisis, Mr Puigdemont told Belgian TV he was not hiding from ""real justice"" but from the ""clearly politicised"" Spanish legal system. This video can not be played Why is there a Catalan crisis? The answer is in its past, as Europe correspondent Gavin Lee explains 1 October 2017:The independence referendum takes place in Catalonia; it is deemed illegal by Spain and boycotted by many potential voters 27 October:Catalonia's leaders declare independence, which leads to the Spanish government imposing direct rule on the region and dissolving its parliament 30 October:Charges of rebellion, sedition and misuse of public funds are brought against various sacked members of the Catalan government, including Mr Puigdemont 2 November:Several former Catalan ministers are taken into custody in Spain 3 November:European Arrest Warrants are issued against Mr Puigdemont and four of his allies, who have all fled to Belgium 5 December:A Spanish judge withdraws the European arrest warrants but says the group still face possible charges for sedition and rebellion 21 December:Carles Puigdemont is re-elected to parliament during Catalan's regional elections - which Spanish PM Mariano Rajoy had called to ""restore democracy"" 1 March 2018:Mr Puigdemont says he is stepping aside and he backs detained activist Jordi Sanchez to run as Catalonia's president 21 March:Mr Sanchez drops his leadership bid and instead the candidacy is passed to Jordi Turull, who the following day is rejected by hardline separatists 23 March:Mr Turull and various others are arrested in Spain, and the European arrest warrants are reissued The man who wants to break up Spain Puigdemont abandons Catalan presidency Catalan ex-leader 'avoids Finnish arrest' Jailed activist ends bid to lead Catalonia Catalan politician defies court summons Catalonia's quarrel with Spain explained Death toll rises amid most destructive wildfire in Los Angeles' history Moment friends abandon house as Palisades fire closes in 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Why does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?

Call to expand pro-breastfeeding schemeMidwives want a scheme in one city aimed at making mothers feel comfortable expanded nationwide.,"A scheme to make it easier for women to breastfeed in public places in Newport should be rolled out across Wales, midwives have said. Cafe and restaurant staff will receive training and window signs will make it clear premises support it. It hopes it will encourage more mothers to breastfeed beyond a baby's first few weeks in a bid to cut the risk of them developing obesity in later life. Some mothers said they had been asked to stop feeding their babies in public. 'Why I gave my baby a friend's breast milk' Is it OK to breastfeed someone else's baby? Half 'unsure' about breastfeeding TheNewport Breastfeeding Welcome Premises Scheme,externalaims to make shops, cafes and other public places more welcoming. A register of supportive premises will be drawn up and staff will receive ""awareness sessions"" on the reasons women choose to breastfeed. Newport council said 2016 figures from Aneurin Bevan University Health Board showed that although a high percentage of babies born in Newport were breastfed at birth, that number fell considerably after six to eight weeks. The Welsh Government's own scheme - the National Breastfeeding Welcome Scheme - ended in 2015, with individual councils left to decide whether to implement their own. The Breastfeeding Welcome logo will be displayed in public places in Newport Helen Rogers, director of the Royal College of Midwives in Wales, said while similar schemes already existed in some areas, there was little joined-up thinking and a nationwide initiative should be put in place. ""We need women to be able to breastfeed in public without having a sense that people will complain,"" she said. ""We know that a number of women still find it difficult and there is a view that women's breasts are a sexual object and it's fine to treat them like that, but it's not fine to breastfeed your baby in public. ""It's not seen as something that's mainstream and it should be."" Businesses have a responsibility, under theEquality Act 2010,externalto ensure that a woman breastfeeding while receiving a service they provide is not treated unfairly, including by other customers. But some mothers say they still face problems. Alice Sockett said she feels ""profoundly uncomfortable"" breastfeeding in public and worries people will criticise her Mother-of-two Alice Sockett said: ""Whilst I know that I have a protected right to breastfeed wherever my children are allowed to be, I still fear being confronted and having to defend that right. ""I would be delighted to see signage welcoming breastfeeding in cafes and restaurants, as I would feel protected."" But she said she was worried it could inadvertently make other places, without signs, be perceived to be less supportive. Sara Powell-Davies said such a scheme would help new mums who might feel nervous Sara Powell-Davies, who has a 16-month-old daughter Tirion, welcomed the plan. ""Knowing you were doing it somewhere that proactively welcomed you would make me more likely to go there knowing you wouldn't get any negative comments,"" she said. ""Although have to say, I have never had anybody say anything negative about feeding in public - only ever had smiles."" Alexandra Jenkins was once asked to stop feeding her son Beau by a fellow customer in a cafe Alexandra Jenkins, who has a one-year-old son Beau, said she ""loved"" the idea, after she had a bad experience in a cafe. She said: ""An elderly lady was eating lunch and asked me to stop feeding as she was eating her lunch with her husband. ""I politely told her that was my son and if she didn't like it, she could take her food home. I was absolutely furious to say the least. It totally knocked my confidence."" Nia Page said the scheme would have helped her when she was a new mum Nia Page, who has an 11-month-old son Jack, said: ""In the early days of motherhood this scheme could have helped me decide where I met friends for a coffee. ""On occasion I would find my self giving my baby a top-up feed in the car before going to a public place."" Sara Connor said: ""It can be daunting first time around, and it's good to feel supported. ""Even if it is just a sticker, it's more - it's reassurance that you're ok and safe and accepted as you are."" Nicola Bainbridge said the panic of having a hungry, crying baby in public was ""indescribable"" Nicola Bainbridge, who has a four-month-old daughter Beatrice, said: ""Knowing that staff recognise the importance of breastfeeding and support feeding in public will help customers to see it as it should be, normal. ""Breastfeeding is normal and natural, anything to support society in recognising this should be promoted."" Transgender woman 'breastfeeds baby' UK 'world's worst' at breastfeeding Shop vouchers could boost breastfeeding A Public Health Wales spokesman said: ""Negative feedback when breastfeeding in public can deter many mums. The introduction of the Breastfeeding Welcome scheme in Newport is a very helpful contribution to overcoming this."" The Welsh Government said a breastfeeding review had been completed and recommendations to improve uptake and provide support were being considered by Health Secretary Vaughan Gething.

Firm in data scandal 'made election boasts'BBC sees papers suggesting Cambridge Analytica's parent company boasted of election interference.5h5 hours agoUK,"A brochure suggests the parent company of scandal-hit data firm Cambridge Analytica boasted of interfering in Nigeria's 2007 election - widely dismissed as lacking credibility The company that became Cambridge Analytica boasted about interfering in foreign elections, according to documents seen by the BBC. Cambridge Analytica is embroiled in a storm over claims it exploited the data of millions of Facebook users. The BBC has seen a brochure published by parent company SCL Elections, it is believed prior to 2014. It claims, for instance, that it organised rallies in Nigeria to weaken support for the opposition in 2007. The UK Foreign Office says it was unaware of this alleged activity before SCL was awarded British government contracts in 2008. Cambridge Analytica says it is looking into the allegations about SCL. Speaking on the Sunday Politics show, Conservative former International Development Secretary Andrew Mitchell said the claims about SCL were ""absolutely appalling"" and ""run totally counter to the policy of the British government in promoting free and fair elections in the developing world"". He added that it is ""perfectly clear that the British government should have nothing to do with it"". Cambridge Analytica: The story so far The data firm's global influence In the document, SCL Elections claimed potential clients could contact the company through ""any British High Commission or Embassy"". It also claims SCL received ""List X"" accreditation from the UK's Ministry of Defence which provided ""Government endorsed clearance to handle information protectively marked as 'confidential' and above"". The brochure outlines how SCL Elections had apparently organised ""anti-election rallies"" to dissuade opposition supporters from voting in the Nigerian presidential election in 2007. Theelection was described by EU monitors as one of the least credible,externalthey had observed. The document claims SCL Elections deliberately exploited ethnic tensions in Latvia in the 2006 national elections in order to help their client. SCL also claims that ahead of the elections in Trinidad and Tobago in 2010, it orchestrated an ""ambitious campaign of political graffiti"" that ""ostensibly came from the youth"" so the client party could ""claim credit for listening to a 'united youth'"". Most of the examples detailed in the brochure took place before the British government entered into at least six contracts with SCL. This video can not be played Cambridge Analytica: What we know so far The former Labour Foreign Office Minister and Cabinet minister Lord Hain has tabled a written question in the House of Lords on Monday for urgent clarification on the matter of Embassy endorsement. He said the SCL case was ""lifting the lid on a potential horror story"" of other companies using data to manipulate voters. The Ministry of Defence has confirmed SLC were given a provisional List X accreditation but had not had it since 2013. A Foreign Office spokesperson said: ""It is not now nor ever has been the case that enquiries for SCL 'can be directed through any British High Commission or Embassy'."" ""Our understanding is that, at the time of the signing of the contract for project work in 2008/9, the FCO was not aware of SCL's reported activity during the 2006 Latvian election or 2007 Nigerian election."" In a statement, the acting CEO of Cambridge Analytica, Dr Alexander Tayler, said ""Cambridge Analytica was formed in 2013, out of a much older company called SCL Elections. ""We take the disturbing recent allegations of unethical practices in our non-US political business very seriously. The board has launched a full and independent investigation into SCL Elections' past practices, and its findings will be made available in due course.""

"Tributes paid to musical visionaryJosÃ© Abreu, whose project changed the lives of impoverished children in Venezuela, dies aged 78.","JosÃ© Abreu's work used music to lift children out of poverty Tributes have been paid following the death of JosÃ© Abreu, founder of a renowned music programme that changed the lives of thousands of children. Abreu founded El Sistema (the system), providing free music education in Venezuela's shantytowns and poor neighbourhoods. The programme has inspired similar systems in other countries. Venezuela announced three days of national mourning for ""Maestro Abreu"", who died on Saturday aged 78. He began the music project in 1975 and counted renowned Venezuelan conductor Gustavo Dudamel among his students. Venezuela's musical visionary Venezuela country profile ""With devoted love and eternal gratitude to my mentor and father of El Sistema,"" tweeted Dudamel, who is now director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic. Abreu was born in the Andean city of Valera on May 7, 1939. Music ran deep in his family - his grandfather had founded an orchestra in Italy and his grandmother was a passionate opera fan. Abreu's mother played piano, and his father the guitar. He pursued music studies but later - to help support his family - he moved to Caracas to take a degree in economics. He later worked as an economist for the government and was elected as a substitute member of parliament in the 1960s. Abreu said he became frustrated that Venezuela had only one orchestra while other countries, such as Argentina, Brazil or Mexico, had achieved greater musical development.

French town mourns attack victimsA memorial Mass has been held in TrÃ¨bes for four people killed by an Islamist gunman on Friday.,"The service was attended by the town's mayor Eric Menassi (c) and his wife Samia Menassi (r), director of Super U supermarket A memorial Mass has been celebrated in the southern French town of TrÃ¨bes, in honour of four people killed by an Islamist gunman on Friday. One of them, policeman Lt-Col Arnaud Beltrame, has been hailed as a hero for trading places with a captive during a siege at a supermarket. The bishop at the church told hundreds of mourners that his actions were comparable to that of a saint. It is the worst jihadist attack under Emmanuel Macron's presidency. The gunman, 25-year-old Redouane Lakdim, had been on an extremist watch list and was known to authorities as a petty criminal, but intelligence services had determined he did not pose a threat. He was shot dead by police. Lakdim, who pledged allegiance to Islamic State militants, was said to have demanded the release of Salah Abdeslam, the most important surviving suspect in the 13 November 2015 attacks in Paris, which killed 130 people. France approves tough new anti-terror laws Tributes paid for hostage-swap policeman Friends and families of the victims also attended the memorial In the packed Church of Saint-Etienne in TrÃ¨bes, the bishop of Carcassonne and Narbonne compared the police officer's actions with those of a Polish saint who volunteered to die in the place of a stranger at the World War Two death camp at Auschwitz. Mourners, which included members of the local Muslim community, lined the back and front steps of the church. ""Your presence tells us that the creators of hatred will not win,"" Bishop Alain Planet said to the Muslim congregates in his address. Outside the 14th-century church, the local imam later said according to the news agency AFP: ""The [Muslim] community has been stabbed, Islam itself has been stabbed... by people who use symbols that are dear to our hearts."" Mourners included Muslims from the nearby Carcassonne community The chief of French police, Richard Lizurey, attended the service and later told reporters that Col Beltrame was an inspiration to those working in the French security services. ""It's an heroic act. In fact an exceptional act, carried out in the heat of action,"" the head of the Gendarmerie said. ""We are proud. Proud to have counted Arnaud Beltrame among us."" The attack has shaken the rural town of 6,000 people, and flowers have been laid in front of the Super U shop where the hostage-taking took place, as well as outside Col Beltrame's police barracks. A separate national memorial in Paris will also honour the killed officer in the coming days. Khadija, a 52-year-old restaurant owner, said she was shocked by what had occurred. ""We thought this only happened in big towns,"" she told AFP. Churchgoers made their way through TV cameras Jean MaziÃ¨res Before the hostage-taking in TrÃ¨bes, Lakdim hijacked a car in nearby Carcassonne, shooting the Portuguese driver and killing passenger Jean MaziÃ¨res, a retired winemaker in his sixties. He organised villages fetes and was described as ""very jolly"" by Marc Rofes, the mayor of Villedubert, where his family lives. ""He loved life, he loved parties... we have lost someone who was liked by everybody,"" he said of Mr MaziÃ¨res, who was married and had one child. The driver of the car remains in a critical condition. This video can not be played Eye-witness says French hostage-taker ran after him Christian MedvÃ¨s After opening fire on a group of police officers out jogging, wounding one, the gunman drove to the Super U in TrÃ¨bes, where he killed the shop's chief butcher, Christian MedvÃ¨s. An amateur runner and one-time local political candidate, Mr MedvÃ¨s, 50, was described as having the ""joy of life"". ""We do not know yet what happened, but knowing Christian, I imagine he would have wanted to intervene,"" his friend Franck Alberti told local paper La DÃ©pÃªche du Midi. He was married with two daughters. HervÃ© Sosna Retired builder HervÃ© Sosna, 65, was at the butcher's counter when Lakdim mounted his assault. The TrÃ¨bes resident ""had a huge intellectual capacity"" and was a capacious reader, especially of poetry, his half-brother told La DÃ©pÃªche du Midi. ""He never asked for anything, and he was killed, just like that."" Arnaud Beltrame The brave police officer has emerged as the human face of this attack, and his actions are being seen as a defiant response to the country's would-be attackers - a reminder of the best of France, says BBC Paris correspondent Lucy Williamson. Although police managed to free hostages from the supermarket, Lakdim had held one woman back as a human shield, and Col Beltrame volunteered to swap himself for her. As he did so, he left his mobile phone on a table with an open line so that police outside could monitor the situation. When police heard gunshots, a tactical team stormed the supermarket. The gunman was killed and Col Beltrame, who was 44, was mortally wounded. He and his wife, Marielle, had been married in a civil ceremony but were planning a church wedding in June. The Catholic priest who was meant to officiate at the ceremony visited Col Beltrame in hospital, where Marielle was keeping vigil, before he died. World leaders, including UK PM Theresa May, have paid tribute to the officer, who was a highly-regarded member of the Gendarmerie Nationale and was described by President Macron on Saturday as someone who ""fought until the end and never gave up"". ""He gave his life for strangers. He must have known that he didn't really have a chance. If that doesn't make him a hero, I don't know what would,"" Col Beltrame's brother, Cedric, told a French radio station on Saturday. This video can not be played ""This was a heroic act"" on the part of the lieutenant-colonel, says Interior Minister GÃ©rard Collomb Speaking to the BBC, Col Arnaud's cousin Florence Nicolic described the officeras a person who was ""so good at his job"". ""Even though we were surprised and shocked when we heard what happened we were not surprised in the sense that that's the thing he would do without hesitation,"" Ms Nicolic said. Col Beltrame was deployed to Iraq in 2005 and was later awarded the Cross for Military Valour for his peacekeeping work. On his return to France, Col Beltrame joined the country's Republican Guard and was tasked with protecting the presidential palace. In 2017, he was named deputy chief of the Gendarmerie Nationale in the French region of Aude. Siege witness: He ran after me.

Call to expand pro-breastfeeding scheme,"A scheme to make it easier for women to breastfeed in public places in Newport should be rolled out across Wales, midwives have said. Cafe and restaurant staff will receive training and window signs will make it clear premises support it. It hopes it will encourage more mothers to breastfeed beyond a baby's first few weeks in a bid to cut the risk of them developing obesity in later life. Some mothers said they had been asked to stop feeding their babies in public. 'Why I gave my baby a friend's breast milk' Is it OK to breastfeed someone else's baby? Half 'unsure' about breastfeeding TheNewport Breastfeeding Welcome Premises Scheme,externalaims to make shops, cafes and other public places more welcoming. A register of supportive premises will be drawn up and staff will receive ""awareness sessions"" on the reasons women choose to breastfeed. Newport council said 2016 figures from Aneurin Bevan University Health Board showed that although a high percentage of babies born in Newport were breastfed at birth, that number fell considerably after six to eight weeks. The Welsh Government's own scheme - the National Breastfeeding Welcome Scheme - ended in 2015, with individual councils left to decide whether to implement their own. The Breastfeeding Welcome logo will be displayed in public places in Newport Helen Rogers, director of the Royal College of Midwives in Wales, said while similar schemes already existed in some areas, there was little joined-up thinking and a nationwide initiative should be put in place. ""We need women to be able to breastfeed in public without having a sense that people will complain,"" she said. ""We know that a number of women still find it difficult and there is a view that women's breasts are a sexual object and it's fine to treat them like that, but it's not fine to breastfeed your baby in public. ""It's not seen as something that's mainstream and it should be."" Businesses have a responsibility, under theEquality Act 2010,externalto ensure that a woman breastfeeding while receiving a service they provide is not treated unfairly, including by other customers. But some mothers say they still face problems. Alice Sockett said she feels ""profoundly uncomfortable"" breastfeeding in public and worries people will criticise her Mother-of-two Alice Sockett said: ""Whilst I know that I have a protected right to breastfeed wherever my children are allowed to be, I still fear being confronted and having to defend that right. ""I would be delighted to see signage welcoming breastfeeding in cafes and restaurants, as I would feel protected."" But she said she was worried it could inadvertently make other places, without signs, be perceived to be less supportive. Sara Powell-Davies said such a scheme would help new mums who might feel nervous Sara Powell-Davies, who has a 16-month-old daughter Tirion, welcomed the plan. ""Knowing you were doing it somewhere that proactively welcomed you would make me more likely to go there knowing you wouldn't get any negative comments,"" she said. ""Although have to say, I have never had anybody say anything negative about feeding in public - only ever had smiles."" Alexandra Jenkins was once asked to stop feeding her son Beau by a fellow customer in a cafe Alexandra Jenkins, who has a one-year-old son Beau, said she ""loved"" the idea, after she had a bad experience in a cafe. She said: ""An elderly lady was eating lunch and asked me to stop feeding as she was eating her lunch with her husband. ""I politely told her that was my son and if she didn't like it, she could take her food home. I was absolutely furious to say the least. It totally knocked my confidence."" Nia Page said the scheme would have helped her when she was a new mum Nia Page, who has an 11-month-old son Jack, said: ""In the early days of motherhood this scheme could have helped me decide where I met friends for a coffee. ""On occasion I would find my self giving my baby a top-up feed in the car before going to a public place."" Sara Connor said: ""It can be daunting first time around, and it's good to feel supported. ""Even if it is just a sticker, it's more - it's reassurance that you're ok and safe and accepted as you are."" Nicola Bainbridge said the panic of having a hungry, crying baby in public was ""indescribable"" Nicola Bainbridge, who has a four-month-old daughter Beatrice, said: ""Knowing that staff recognise the importance of breastfeeding and support feeding in public will help customers to see it as it should be, normal. ""Breastfeeding is normal and natural, anything to support society in recognising this should be promoted."" Transgender woman 'breastfeeds baby' UK 'world's worst' at breastfeeding Shop vouchers could boost breastfeeding A Public Health Wales spokesman said: ""Negative feedback when breastfeeding in public can deter many mums. The introduction of the Breastfeeding Welcome scheme in Newport is a very helpful contribution to overcoming this."" The Welsh Government said a breastfeeding review had been completed and recommendations to improve uptake and provide support were being considered by Health Secretary Vaughan Gething.

'Streaming services are too similar',"Jimmy Iovine launched Interscope Records and Beats headphones before joining Apple Music Apple Music executive Jimmy Iovine says streaming services are too similar - and need to diversify to survive. ""The streaming services are all charging $9.99 and everyone has the same music,"" he told the BBC. ""And it's really nice. You get whatever song you want, you get your playlists - but there's got to be more interaction between the artist and the audience. ""Sooner or later, something's got to give,"" he said, indicating that Apple Music wanted more original content. ""Netflix [is] spending $6bn (Â£4.2bn) a year on original content,"" said Iovine. ""They have a unique catalogue and they charge you $10.99."" On streaming sites, however, ""the labels want you to have the same music"". He said: ""So there's a real rub there. Sooner or later something's going to give."" Streaming fuels music industry boom How rock and rap combined to create Beats Dr Dre makes rare live appearance in London Apple has had some success with exclusives in the past, scoring big hits with Drake's Views and Frank Ocean's Blonde. But it has recently moved away from the strategy, preferring to invest in filmed content, including the Carpool Karaoke series, and its Beats 1 radio station, which boasts shows presented by Elton John, Drake and St Vincent. Drake, who has released several Apple Music exclusives, is the most-streamed artist in the world The company's chief rival, Spotify, has largely avoided exclusives. However itreleased its ""first ever original new song"",external- by up-and-coming pop singers Nina Nesbitt, Charlotte Lawrence and Sahsa Sloan - earlier this week, indicating ambitions to become a virtual record label. Iovine, who produced records for Bruce Springsteen and U2 before founding Beats headphones and joining Apple, argues that streaming sites are still too limited in their scope. ""They're not enough as just a utility where you go there and you get the music. They have to move you, bring culture to you,"" he said. ""I don't think any of the services are there yet. They need to be cultural hangars for people to go to, where artists communicate with their audience. ""I'm very dedicated to that."" The executive was speaking as the US recording industry revealed itsrevenues had risen 16.5% to $8.7bn (Â£6.2bn) in 2017,external, with streaming contributing two-thirds of the total. Meanwhile, digital downloads  - once seen as the saviour of the industry - are now being outsold by CDs and vinyl. A total of 4.1 million vinyl records were sold in the UK last year Apple has previously deniedrumours it would ""phase out"" the iTunes download store next year,external, but Iovine told the BBC such a move was inevitable. There is no concrete timescale, but he said: ""If I'm honest, it's when people stop buying. ""It's very simple."" Iovine was speaking to the BBC a few days before theWall Street Journal reported,externalhe would step back from day-to-day involvement in Apple's streaming business and move into a consulting role. The 65-year-old was in the UK to promote the HBO/Netflix documentaryThe Defiant Ones,external, which tells the parallel stories of Iovine and hip-hop producer Dr Dre, who became his partner in developing Beats Electronics. His rise to the top of the industry is chronicled in close detail - from the day he almost got sacked by Bruce Springsteen to the controversy he stoked by releasing records by Tupac Shakur and Marilyn Manson as the head of Interscope Records in the 1990s. Iovine reflects on some of those memories below. When Bono describes you in the film, he says: ""There's something in him that's attracted to rage."" What do you make of that? He's right! I like the edgier stuff. If I have a choice, I'll always lean that way. It's such an expression of someone's power and commitment. I'm always looking for music that has a certain amount of dealing with social injustice, or screaming out loud, like Eminem. A pivotal moment in your career is recording Born To Run - but it was hard work, right? I come from a place where working hard is like: ""It's five o'clock, I'm getting the hell out of here."" When I met Bruce Springsteen, I was like: ""This guy doesn't stop until it's right? What the hell has that got to do with anything?"" So during the album, there's this whole thing about the drums. I'm trying to get the drum sound and he just stands over me and says the word ""stick"" over and over again. And after what felt like six weeks, I just said: ""I'm done. I can't do this any more."" Bruce's producer Jon Landau convinces you to stay. Why was he so persuasive? Landau looked at me and said: ""Hang on a second. I'm going to teach you something that you can take with you for the rest of your life. This is not about you. This is about the greater good of the album. ""Now you go back in there and tell Bruce Springsteen you are going to support him in whatever he wants, and for as long as it takes - and you'll have learned a big lesson."" It hit me in the head like a two by four. I realised the amount of humility it takes [to make a hit record]. So I got my work ethic from Bruce Springsteen, period. Later on, you took Springsteen's Because The Night and gave it to Patti Smith. Why did you think it would work for her? When I heard those lyrics - ""Because the night belongs to lovers"" - I said: ""Wow, if Patti sings that, that's going to sound so powerful from her perspective. Very different than if it comes from a man."" Of course, she didn't want to do it in the beginning. She resisted at first. But as you see in the documentary, there's a beautiful ballet that gets it done. Allow YouTube content? This article contains content provided by Google YouTube.

How did you end up signing Dr Dre and Tupac to Interscope? These guys reminded me of Mick Jagger and Keith Richards. They scare you but their music draws you in. When you signed Dre, no-one wanted to play his records. How did turn it around? I played [Nothin' But A] G Thang to my radio people, and they said: ""Radio's never going to play this, MTV's not going to touch it, it'll never be played in Europe, it'll never be played in Asia. Never, never, never, never.""  They thought I was nuts. So I told my radio guys: ""Do me a favour, make me a one-minute edit and [send it to] 50 of the top [radio] markets in the country. They can't stop that, because that's an ad."" Now, it didn't say Dr Dre on the ad. It didn't say anything, it was just the music - but all of the sudden the phones started exploding. So then we made a clean version and radio started playing it. Jimmy Iovine dated Stevie Nicks while they recorded her 1981 solo album Bella Donna How did you end up starting an electronics company? The minute I saw Napster, I realised the record industry was toast. It was free, easy and just smarter than the way we were doing things. So I felt it would be trouble, and I was looking for stuff to do. Then I'm walking down the beach and Dre says: ""Hey man, my lawyer wants me to sell sneakers."" I said: ""Dre, nobody cares what sneakers you wear. That's not what you're about. You're about audio. People will buy the audio you recommend."" And I said: ""Screw sneakers, do speakers."" Dre and Iovine sold Beats to Apple for $3bn in 2014 But you ended up making headphones instead... Headphones looked like medical equipment before Beats. The most popular company was saying: ""You can go to sleep with our headphones."" We wanted to make headphones that were exciting. And that's why I believe that Beats changed the industry. After Apple bought Beats, you ended up in the streaming business. Do you think artists are getting a fair deal out of it? Artists deserve to get paid, period. And get paid a lot. What's happening right now, as far as paid-for streaming, it's almost better for new bands than it is for the catalogue. The new bands are getting a lot of traction, because younger people are on streaming. Where it gets tricky is the artists' relationship with the record label or the publisher [and how the money is distributed]. The problem the artists have is not with the streaming services. I'll stand behind that with everything from a calculator to my fingers. Bruce Springsteen says the key to your success is a ""tremendous lack of fear"". How true is that? That's the underlying theme of the documentary - channelling fear. When I was a kid, I was afraid of everything. I was in a neighbourhood where physicality was the currency and I was a little guy. I was terrified of school. I still have fear today, but you channel it and you use it as a tailwind instead of a headwind. I mean, you're not supposed to walk into somebody who's got a shotgun pointed at you. That's stupid. But the normal, everyday fear that we all have? You can harness it and it's a powerful, powerful thing. The Defiant Ones is streaming now on Netflix.

Tributes paid to musical visionary,"JosÃ© Abreu's work used music to lift children out of poverty Tributes have been paid following the death of JosÃ© Abreu, founder of a renowned music programme that changed the lives of thousands of children. Abreu founded El Sistema (the system), providing free music education in Venezuela's shantytowns and poor neighbourhoods. The programme has inspired similar systems in other countries. Venezuela announced three days of national mourning for ""Maestro Abreu"", who died on Saturday aged 78. He began the music project in 1975 and counted renowned Venezuelan conductor Gustavo Dudamel among his students. Venezuela's musical visionary Venezuela country profile ""With devoted love and eternal gratitude to my mentor and father of El Sistema,"" tweeted Dudamel, who is now director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic. Abreu was born in the Andean city of Valera on May 7, 1939. Music ran deep in his family - his grandfather had founded an orchestra in Italy and his grandmother was a passionate opera fan. Abreu's mother played piano, and his father the guitar. He pursued music studies but later - to help support his family - he moved to Caracas to take a degree in economics. He later worked as an economist for the government and was elected as a substitute member of parliament in the 1960s. Abreu said he became frustrated that Venezuela had only one orchestra while other countries, such as Argentina, Brazil or Mexico, had achieved greater musical development. ""That's when the idea was born to organise a system to have at least one great Venezuelan-born orchestra,"" he recalled. Hundreds of thousands of children in Venezuela are enrolled in El Sistema He founded El Sistema in 1975 in a garage with just 11 musicians. ""They were so determined and so enthusiastic that I understood from that very moment that success was guaranteed,"" he remembered. The network eventually grew to 300 choirs and orchestras.

Calls on Australia captain to go in ball row,"Smith first captained Australia in December 2014, and took the role full-time when Michael Clarke retired after the 2015 Ashes in England Australia captain Steve Smith must be immediately removed from his role over the ball-tampering row in South Africa, an Australian government agency says. Smith said on Saturdaythat the team's ""leadership group"" had spoken about a plan to tamper with the ball, carried out by batsman Cameron Bancroft. The Australian Sports Commission (ASC) has now called for Smith ""to be stood down immediately, along with any other members of the team leadership group or coaching staff who had prior awareness of, or involvement in, the plan"". The incident took place on the third day of the third Test between South Africa and Australia in Cape Town - escalating the tension around what has been an ill-tempered series. The ASC statement added: ""This [Smith's removal] can occur while Cricket Australia completes a full investigation. The ASC condemns cheating of any form in sport. The ASC expects and requires that Australian teams and athletes demonstrate unimpeachable integrity in representing our country."" Earlier, Cricket Australia (CA) chief executive officer James Sutherlandannounced that such an investigation would now take place- with CA's head of integrity Iain Roy and head of team performance Pat Howard travelling to South Africa to ""gather relevant information"" - but that Smith would remain as skipper for now. TMS podcast: Australia wakes up to ball-tampering nightmare Umpires have the power to change the ball and award five penalty runs to the batting side if they feel it has been altered illegally - although they did not do so in this case Bancroft has been charged by the International Cricket Council (ICC) with attempting to change the condition of the ball - which is prohibited byLaw 41.3.,external Roughing up one side of the ball can help the fielding side achieve ""reverse swing"" - in which the ball moves in the opposite direction to conventional swing, which is achieved by polishing one side of the ball. There are several methods by which the ball can be deliberately roughed up - ranging from the outright illegal (scuffing it with a bottle top, or scratching with fingernails), to those which are frowned upon but frequently take place anyway, such as throwing the ball into the stumps on the bounce, or applying saliva after sucking sugary sweets. Polishing the ball on your clothing is allowed if no artificial substance is used, as is drying a wet ball with a towel that has been approved by the umpires, or removing mud from the ball under an umpire's supervision. The umpire's ultimate sanction, if they feel the ball has been altered illegally, is to change the ball and award five penalty runs to the batting side - although this did not take place in Cape Town. Such an instance did take place at The Oval in 2006 when umpires Darrell Hair and Billy Doctrove ruled that Pakistan had tampered with the ball during a Test against England. Pakistan refused to take the field after tea in protest, andforfeited the Test.,external Current South Africa captain Faf du Plessis has also had two major run-ins with the authorities over ball-tampering. In 2013, he was caught on camerarubbing the ball against a zip on his trouser pocketin a Test in Dubai, which earned Pakistan five penalty runs and a change of ball, and Du Plessis a fine. Three years later in Hobart,Australia were incensed when TV footage appeared to show Du Plessis licking his finger and shining the ball while eating a sweet - which cost him his match fee. Less than 24 hours after Bancroft was caught by the cameras taking what he said was yellow tape out of his trouser pocket before rubbing the ball, the row had escalated enough for Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull to speak out about the issue. ""I am shocked and bitterly disappointed by the news from South Africa,"" said Turnbull. ""It seems beyond belief the Australian cricket team have been involved in cheating. Our cricketers are role models and cricket is synonymous with fair play. How can our team be engaged in cheating like this? It beggars belief."" Turnbull later added: ""I have spoken with David Peever, the chairman of Cricket Australia, and I have expressed to him very clearly and unequivocally my disappointment and concern. He has said to me that Cricket Australia will be responding decisively, as they should. ""It's their responsibility to deal with it, but I have to say that the whole nation, who hold those who wear the baggy green up on a pedestal - about as high as you can get in Australia, certainly higher than any politician, that's for sure - this is a shocking disappointment."" This video can not be played Watch: Bancroft and Smith admit ball-tampering plan Michael Clarke, Smith's immediate predecessor as Test captain, called it ""a terrible day for Australian cricket"", described the plan as ""premeditated cheating"" and condemned its instigators for choosing rookie batsman Bancroft to carry it out. ""I can't believe the leadership group have got a young kid playing in his eighth Test match to do this,"" Clarke told Australia's Channel Nine. ""We have got the best bowling attack in the world. We don't need to cheat to beat anyone."" Clarke retired from international cricket in 2015 after suffering with a chronic back problem for many years, but when asked whether he would consider a shock return if Smith were to depart, he replied: ""If I was asked by the right people, then I would think about my answer."" Former Test vice-captain Adam Gilchristtold BBC Radio 5 livethat he was ""stunned and shocked... embarrassed and sad"". The legendary wicketkeeper said: ""Australian cricket is the laughing stock of the sporting world. ""I remember being a current player and the last thing you wanted was ex-players putting the boot in, but I have the feeling we have been all really badly let down here. ""The only positive is that they admitted it. We'll get stories now where it will be 'oh, all teams do it, in different levels and different ways'. But it's not bending the spirit of the game, it's going outside the laws. It's not acceptable."" Listen: BBC Radio 5 live In Short - Gilchrist says Australia are a 'laughing stock' Players have clashed during a bad-tempered series - notably Quinton de Kock and David Warner, who were both sanctioned by the ICC after the first Test The South Africa-Australia series had already contained several flashpoints before the sides arrived in Cape Town for the current third Test. Smith's vice-captain David Warner had to be restrained by team-mates during an off-field altercation with Proteas wicketkeeper Quinton de Kock during the first Test in Durban, for whichboth players were fined by the ICC and given demerit points. South Africa pace bowler Kagiso Rabada was thenhanded a two-match suspensionafter deliberately brushing shoulders with Smith after celebrating his dismissal in the second Test at Port Elizabeth, butwon an appealto reduce his punishment to one demerit point rather than two, meaning he avoided a ban but remains one point away from it being triggered. Australia coach Darren Lehmann then hit out at what he described as""disgraceful"" verbal abusetowards his side in the early stages of the Cape Town Test. ""The Australian team have been playing under a siege mentality,"" ABC commentator Adam Collins told BBC Test Match Special. ""Lehmann had complained about the treatment the players have been getting - they are furious about what has happened in the last couple of weeks. Steve Smith is not a bad bloke. There is something else going on here. ""But the response on social media is very strong. It is trending against Steve Smith - it's not as if people are defending him. Smith knows he is in a lot of trouble. ""Australian fans would rather see their team lose than win like this."" Smith made his Test debut against Pakistan in 2010, in a neutral series played in England The blond quiff has flattened and darkened somewhat over the years, and on the field Steve Smith is almost unrecognisable from the raw 21-year-old who made his Test debut against Pakistan at Lord's in July 2010. Selected primarily for his leg-spin bowling, Smith made one and 12 batting at number eight and nine in that game. He made two half-centuries in his first 10 Test innings, but was dropped after Australia lost the 2010-11 Ashes to England. While his bowling was - and remains - wildly inconsistent, it was doubts about his unorthodox batting technique that meant he was out of the Test side for two years. But on his return, he slowly became such an integral part of the side that at 26, he was the natural successor to Michael Clarke as captain in 2015, while his batting statistics soared to the point where hesitantcomparisons were drawn with Australia legend Sir Donald Bradman. Passing the 1,000-run mark in the past four calendar years, he was at the top of his game in the 2017-18 Ashes against England, hitting a career-best 239 as skipper at Perth to regain the urn, and averaging an incredible 137.40 across the five Tests to sit at the top of the ICC's batting rankings. Yet his rise has not been without controversy. In March 2017, India were angered afterSmith looked up to the dressing roomwhile pondering whether to review an lbw decision - contrary to ICC regulations that outlaw off-field assistance. And his Australia side's behaviour has been increasingly questioned, with senior Australian radio commentator Jim Maxwell commenting: ""I've started to become more and more offended by the arrogance of some of the players in the way they behave.""

Smith & Warner step down for rest of Test,"Steve Smith (right) will miss the fourth Test against South Africa while the ICC says it hopes Cameron Bancroft (left) has learned from his mistake Australia captain Steve Smith has been banned for one match and fined his entire match fee by cricket's world governing body for his part in a ball-tampering incident in South Africa. Smith saidthe team's ""leadership group"" had a plan, carried out by Cameron Bancroft, to tamper with the ball to ""get an advantage"". Smith, 28, will now miss the fourth and final Test of the series. Bancroft, 25, was fined 75% of his match fee and got three demerit points. Smith admitted a charge of conduct ""of a serious nature that is contrary to the spirit of the game"",said a statement,externalfrom the International Cricket Council (ICC). ""As captain, Steve Smith must take full responsibility for the actions of his players and it is appropriate that he be suspended,"" said ICC chief executive David Richardson. Hours later, the Australians lost 10 wickets in the final session of day four to lose the third Test by 322 runs. Chasing a target of 430, they reached 47-0 at tea but were all out for 107. Smith had made one when he top-edged Kagiso Rabada for six, but soon departed for seven. South Africa fast bowler Morne Morkel, who willretire from international cricketat the end of the series, took the final wicket to finish with 5-23 as the hosts took a 2-1 series lead.

The key questions after ball-tampering shame Drying it, cleaning it, even smelling it... five memorable ball-tampering controversies This video can not be played Australia ball-tampering: I don't remember ever being as disappointed - Jim Maxwell The ball-tampering incident took place on the third day in Cape Town - escalating the tension around what has been an ill-tempered series. Television footage showed Bancroft take what he said was yellow tape out of his trouser pocket before rubbing the ball. Smith said after play it was a ""big mistake"" but that he would not stand down. Cricket Australia (CA) has begun an investigation into the actions of its team, which Australia's prime minister Malcolm Turnbull said had ""shocked and bitterly disappointed"" him. ""The game needs to have a hard look at itself,"" added ICC chief Richardson. ""The ICC needs to do more to prevent poor behaviour and better police the spirit of the game, defining more clearly what is expected of players and enforcing the regulations in a consistent fashion. ""In addition, and most importantly, member countries need to show more accountability for their teams' conduct. ""Winning is important but not at the expense of the spirit of the game which is intrinsic and precious to the sport of cricket. We have to raise the bar across all areas."" Former England batsman Kevin Pietersen gives his view on the positions of Australia coach Darren Lehmann and his assistant David Saker Batsman Bancroft admitted ""changing the condition of the ball in breach of clause 41.3"" and accepted his punishment from Andy Pycroft, who is on the elite panel of ICC match referees. ""To carry a foreign object on to the field of play with the intention of changing the condition of the ball to gain an unfair advantage over your opponent is against not only the laws, but the spirit of the game as well,"" said Pycroft. ""That said, I acknowledge Cameron has accepted responsibility for his actions by pleading guilty to the charge and apologising publicly. ""As a young player starting out in international cricket, I hope the lessons learned from this episode will strongly influence the way he plays the game during the rest of his career."" Players who accumulate four demerit points in a two-year period receive a one-match ban, while those who get eight in the same 24-month period are banned for two matches. Neither Smith nor Bancroft had any demerit points on their records before this incident. Prior to the start of the fourth day's play, CA chief executive James Sutherland said Smith and David Warner had ""agreed to stand down as captain and vice-captain respectively for the remainder of this Test match"". Wicketkeeper Tim Paine was appointed acting captain for the rest of the match, though Smith and Warner continued to play. ""This Test match needs to proceed, and in the interim we will continue to investigate this matter with the urgency that it demands,"" added Sutherland. ""Cricket Australia and Australian cricket fans expect certain standards of conduct from cricketers representing our country, and on this occasion these standards have not been met. ""All Australians, like us, want answers and we will keep you updated on our findings, as a matter of priority."" CA's head of integrity Iain Roy and head of team performance Pat Howard have travelled to Australia to, according to Sutherland, ""gather the relevant information CA need to address this matter and understand it better"".

BBC cricket correspondent Jonathan Agnew Ball-tampering has always happened in cricket but it's exceptionally difficult to prove. This time they have someone who has admitted his guilt - he's a captain, the act was premeditated and, worst of all, he has clearly coerced the most inexperienced player in his team to go out and do the dirty work for them, and that's awful. Australia have very few friends in cricket at the moment. The boorish way in which they've behaved over the years hasn't helped. The current series between Australia and South Africa has been ill-tempered. There's been bad blood about the way the Australians play the game. Many in the cricket world will feel a sense of satisfaction today about what they'll see as chickens coming home to roost. I really think this is an opportunity for the Australian authorities to look very carefully at their game.

Australia came into the series against South Africa on the back of a convincing 4-0 victory on home soil over England, who are involved in a two-Test series in New Zealand. England bowler Stuart Broad says he did not sense anything untoward in the defeat in Australia but says it is ""strange"" Smith's side changed their approach in South Africa. ""We played five Ashes Tests and they reversed it in pretty much all of them, and ondrop-in pitches,"",externalsaid Broad. ""So to then change their method on a tour to South Africa in the third Test match seems a slightly strange one."" He added: ""There were occasions when they we reverse swinging it when we didn't find the means to be able to do that. We just class that down to home conditions. ""We move the ball differently to different teams in England, and Australia moved it better than we did and out-bowled us in Australia. That's how we saw it. ""Steve has come out and said it's the first time they've ever tried it and we have to believe his words.""

Firm in data scandal 'made election boasts'The BBC sees documents suggesting Cambridge Analytica's parent company boasted of election interference.8m8 minutes agoUK,"A brochure suggests the parent company of scandal-hit data firm Cambridge Analytica boasted of interfering in Nigeria's 2007 election - widely dismissed as lacking credibility The company that became Cambridge Analytica boasted about interfering in foreign elections, according to documents seen by the BBC. Cambridge Analytica is embroiled in a storm over claims it exploited the data of millions of Facebook users. The BBC has seen a brochure published by parent company SCL Elections, it is believed prior to 2014. It claims, for instance, that it organised rallies in Nigeria to weaken support for the opposition in 2007. The UK Foreign Office says it was unaware of this alleged activity before SCL was awarded British government contracts in 2008. Cambridge Analytica says it is looking into the allegations about SCL. Speaking on the Sunday Politics show, Conservative former International Development Secretary Andrew Mitchell said the claims about SCL were ""absolutely appalling"" and ""run totally counter to the policy of the British government in promoting free and fair elections in the developing world"". He added that it is ""perfectly clear that the British government should have nothing to do with it"". Cambridge Analytica: The story so far The data firm's global influence In the document, SCL Elections claimed potential clients could contact the company through ""any British High Commission or Embassy"". It also claims SCL received ""List X"" accreditation from the UK's Ministry of Defence which provided ""Government endorsed clearance to handle information protectively marked as 'confidential' and above"". The brochure outlines how SCL Elections had apparently organised ""anti-election rallies"" to dissuade opposition supporters from voting in the Nigerian presidential election in 2007. Theelection was described by EU monitors as one of the least credible,externalthey had observed. The document claims SCL Elections deliberately exploited ethnic tensions in Latvia in the 2006 national elections in order to help their client. SCL also claims that ahead of the elections in Trinidad and Tobago in 2010, it orchestrated an ""ambitious campaign of political graffiti"" that ""ostensibly came from the youth"" so the client party could ""claim credit for listening to a 'united youth'"". Most of the examples detailed in the brochure took place before the British government entered into at least six contracts with SCL. This video can not be played Cambridge Analytica: What we know so far The former Labour Foreign Office Minister and Cabinet minister Lord Hain has tabled a written question in the House of Lords on Monday for urgent clarification on the matter of Embassy endorsement. He said the SCL case was ""lifting the lid on a potential horror story"" of other companies using data to manipulate voters. The Ministry of Defence has confirmed SLC were given a provisional List X accreditation but had not had it since 2013. A Foreign Office spokesperson said: ""It is not now nor ever has been the case that enquiries for SCL 'can be directed through any British High Commission or Embassy'."" ""Our understanding is that, at the time of the signing of the contract for project work in 2008/9, the FCO was not aware of SCL's reported activity during the 2006 Latvian election or 2007 Nigerian election."" In a statement, the acting CEO of Cambridge Analytica, Dr Alexander Tayler, said ""Cambridge Analytica was formed in 2013, out of a much older company called SCL Elections. ""We take the disturbing recent allegations of unethical practices in our non-US political business very seriously. The board has launched a full and independent investigation into SCL Elections' past practices, and its findings will be made available in due course.""

'Streaming services are too similar'Apple Music executive Jimmy Iovine says streaming services need to diversify to survive.5h5 hours agoEntertainment & Arts,"Jimmy Iovine launched Interscope Records and Beats headphones before joining Apple Music Apple Music executive Jimmy Iovine says streaming services are too similar - and need to diversify to survive. ""The streaming services are all charging $9.99 and everyone has the same music,"" he told the BBC. ""And it's really nice. You get whatever song you want, you get your playlists - but there's got to be more interaction between the artist and the audience. ""Sooner or later, something's got to give,"" he said, indicating that Apple Music wanted more original content. ""Netflix [is] spending $6bn (Â£4.2bn) a year on original content,"" said Iovine. ""They have a unique catalogue and they charge you $10.99."" On streaming sites, however, ""the labels want you to have the same music"". He said: ""So there's a real rub there. Sooner or later something's going to give."" Streaming fuels music industry boom How rock and rap combined to create Beats Dr Dre makes rare live appearance in London Apple has had some success with exclusives in the past, scoring big hits with Drake's Views and Frank Ocean's Blonde. But it has recently moved away from the strategy, preferring to invest in filmed content, including the Carpool Karaoke series, and its Beats 1 radio station, which boasts shows presented by Elton John, Drake and St Vincent. Drake, who has released several Apple Music exclusives, is the most-streamed artist in the world The company's chief rival, Spotify, has largely avoided exclusives. However itreleased its ""first ever original new song"",external- by up-and-coming pop singers Nina Nesbitt, Charlotte Lawrence and Sahsa Sloan - earlier this week, indicating ambitions to become a virtual record label. Iovine, who produced records for Bruce Springsteen and U2 before founding Beats headphones and joining Apple, argues that streaming sites are still too limited in their scope. ""They're not enough as just a utility where you go there and you get the music. They have to move you, bring culture to you,"" he said. ""I don't think any of the services are there yet. They need to be cultural hangars for people to go to, where artists communicate with their audience. ""I'm very dedicated to that."" The executive was speaking as the US recording industry revealed itsrevenues had risen 16.5% to $8.7bn (Â£6.2bn) in 2017,external, with streaming contributing two-thirds of the total. Meanwhile, digital downloads  - once seen as the saviour of the industry - are now being outsold by CDs and vinyl. A total of 4.1 million vinyl records were sold in the UK last year Apple has previously deniedrumours it would ""phase out"" the iTunes download store next year,external, but Iovine told the BBC such a move was inevitable. There is no concrete timescale, but he said: ""If I'm honest, it's when people stop buying. ""It's very simple."" Iovine was speaking to the BBC a few days before theWall Street Journal reported,externalhe would step back from day-to-day involvement in Apple's streaming business and move into a consulting role. The 65-year-old was in the UK to promote the HBO/Netflix documentaryThe Defiant Ones,external, which tells the parallel stories of Iovine and hip-hop producer Dr Dre, who became his partner in developing Beats Electronics. His rise to the top of the industry is chronicled in close detail - from the day he almost got sacked by Bruce Springsteen to the controversy he stoked by releasing records by Tupac Shakur and Marilyn Manson as the head of Interscope Records in the 1990s. Iovine reflects on some of those memories below. When Bono describes you in the film, he says: ""There's something in him that's attracted to rage."" What do you make of that? He's right! I like the edgier stuff. If I have a choice, I'll always lean that way. It's such an expression of someone's power and commitment. I'm always looking for music that has a certain amount of dealing with social injustice, or screaming out loud, like Eminem. A pivotal moment in your career is recording Born To Run - but it was hard work, right? I come from a place where working hard is like: ""It's five o'clock, I'm getting the hell out of here."" When I met Bruce Springsteen, I was like: ""This guy doesn't stop until it's right? What the hell has that got to do with anything?"" So during the album, there's this whole thing about the drums. I'm trying to get the drum sound and he just stands over me and says the word ""stick"" over and over again. And after what felt like six weeks, I just said: ""I'm done. I can't do this any more."" Bruce's producer Jon Landau convinces you to stay. Why was he so persuasive? Landau looked at me and said: ""Hang on a second. I'm going to teach you something that you can take with you for the rest of your life. This is not about you. This is about the greater good of the album. ""Now you go back in there and tell Bruce Springsteen you are going to support him in whatever he wants, and for as long as it takes - and you'll have learned a big lesson."" It hit me in the head like a two by four. I realised the amount of humility it takes [to make a hit record]. So I got my work ethic from Bruce Springsteen, period. Later on, you took Springsteen's Because The Night and gave it to Patti Smith. Why did you think it would work for her? When I heard those lyrics - ""Because the night belongs to lovers"" - I said: ""Wow, if Patti sings that, that's going to sound so powerful from her perspective. Very different than if it comes from a man."" Of course, she didn't want to do it in the beginning. She resisted at first. But as you see in the documentary, there's a beautiful ballet that gets it done. Allow YouTube content? This article contains content provided by Google YouTube.

How did you end up signing Dr Dre and Tupac to Interscope? These guys reminded me of Mick Jagger and Keith Richards. They scare you but their music draws you in. When you signed Dre, no-one wanted to play his records. How did turn it around? I played [Nothin' But A] G Thang to my radio people, and they said: ""Radio's never going to play this, MTV's not going to touch it, it'll never be played in Europe, it'll never be played in Asia. Never, never, never, never.""  They thought I was nuts. So I told my radio guys: ""Do me a favour, make me a one-minute edit and [send it to] 50 of the top [radio] markets in the country. They can't stop that, because that's an ad."" Now, it didn't say Dr Dre on the ad. It didn't say anything, it was just the music - but all of the sudden the phones started exploding. So then we made a clean version and radio started playing it. Jimmy Iovine dated Stevie Nicks while they recorded her 1981 solo album Bella Donna How did you end up starting an electronics company? The minute I saw Napster, I realised the record industry was toast. It was free, easy and just smarter than the way we were doing things. So I felt it would be trouble, and I was looking for stuff to do. Then I'm walking down the beach and Dre says: ""Hey man, my lawyer wants me to sell sneakers."" I said: ""Dre, nobody cares what sneakers you wear. That's not what you're about. You're about audio. People will buy the audio you recommend."" And I said: ""Screw sneakers, do speakers."" Dre and Iovine sold Beats to Apple for $3bn in 2014 But you ended up making headphones instead... Headphones looked like medical equipment before Beats. The most popular company was saying: ""You can go to sleep with our headphones."" We wanted to make headphones that were exciting. And that's why I believe that Beats changed the industry. After Apple bought Beats, you ended up in the streaming business. Do you think artists are getting a fair deal out of it? Artists deserve to get paid, period. And get paid a lot. What's happening right now, as far as paid-for streaming, it's almost better for new bands than it is for the catalogue. The new bands are getting a lot of traction, because younger people are on streaming. Where it gets tricky is the artists' relationship with the record label or the publisher [and how the money is distributed]. The problem the artists have is not with the streaming services. I'll stand behind that with everything from a calculator to my fingers. Bruce Springsteen says the key to your success is a ""tremendous lack of fear"". How true is that? That's the underlying theme of the documentary - channelling fear. When I was a kid, I was afraid of everything. I was in a neighbourhood where physicality was the currency and I was a little guy. I was terrified of school. I still have fear today, but you channel it and you use it as a tailwind instead of a headwind. I mean, you're not supposed to walk into somebody who's got a shotgun pointed at you. That's stupid. But the normal, everyday fear that we all have? You can harness it and it's a powerful, powerful thing. The Defiant Ones is streaming now on Netflix.

Syria rebel evacuations gather pace,"Those boarding the buses were searched and then given food and water Syrian rebel groups have pulled out of more towns in the Eastern Ghouta, as the government tightens it grip on the enclave outside Damascus. Buses carrying fighters, their families and others left the area late on Saturday, leaving the city of Douma as the last rebel-held stronghold. The evacuations followed a deal between government forces and a local rebel group, Faylaq al-Rahman. About 70% of the Eastern Ghouta is now under government control. Hundreds of people have been killed since Syrian government forces, supported by the Russian military, launched an offensive on the rebel-held territory last month. In recent weeks, they have cut the Eastern Ghouta into three separate pockets, forcing rebels to negotiate withdrawals. 'We will stay until the end': A doctor's battle in Eastern Ghouta Eastern Ghouta devastation seen from space Why is there a war in Syria? Saturday's evacuations from the towns of Zamalka, Arbin and Ain Tarma had been due to start in the morning but buses only arrived in the afternoon. Footage showed the buses queuing at a crossing point into the enclave before travelling along a route cleared of wreckage and unexploded shells and mines. Under the agreement between government forces and Faylaq al-Rahman, some 7,000 people in total will be driven to opposition-held territory in north-western Idlib province. On Sunday, residents in Arbin were packing in preparation for more evacuations - although it was unclear when buses would arrive. Negotiations with another rebel group, Jaish al-Islam, about the surrender of Douma are understood to be continuing. This video can not be played Eastern Ghouta: A mother's diary of life under siege Syrian state TV broadcast pictures of troops moving into towns abandoned by rebels, highlighting trenches and other fortifications left behind. It also showed prisoners released by the rebels being loaded into minibuses. Another deal struck last week saw thousands of people evacuated from the town of Harasta on Friday. The rebels in the Eastern Ghouta encompass multiple factions, including jihadists, and in-fighting between them has led to losses of ground to the Syrian government. Jaish al-Islam and its rival Faylaq al-Rahman are the largest groups. The Eastern Ghouta is so close to Damascus that rebels have been able to fire mortars into the heart of the capital, leading to scores of civilian deaths. Rebel rocket fire reportedly killed a young Syrian footballer and wounded seven others as they were training in Damascus on Saturday.

Huge gun-control rallies sweep US,"This video can not be played Emma Gonzalez demonstrated the power of silence during her speech Hundreds of thousands of protesters have taken to the streets across the US to call for tighter gun control. The March For Our Lives movement arose after 17 deaths in a school shooting in Parkland, Florida, last month. Student leader and Parkland survivor Emma Gonzalez gave a powerful speech at the main Washington DC event. After listing the names of the victims, she stayed silent on stage for six minutes, 20 seconds - the time it took for them to be killed. This video can not be played 'Our message to the world is...' More than 800 sister protests were planned nationwide and abroad, with solidarity events taking place in Edinburgh, London, Geneva, Sydney and Tokyo. As events began to draw to a close on the US east coast, they continued on the west, including a major demonstration in Los Angeles. As it happened: March For Our Lives In pictures: Marches across the US and worldwide Huge crowds - including a high proportion of young people and children - gathered along Pennsylvania Avenue, with placards reading ""Protect kids not guns"" and ""Am I next?"". Singers Ariana Grande, Miley Cyrus and Lin-Manuel Miranda, the man behind hit musical Hamilton, performed on a stage erected in front of the US Capitol building. Jennifer Hudson - who has lost her mother, brother and nephew to gun violence - sang Bob Dylan's The Times They Are a-Changin The music was interspersed with speeches from impassioned youth leaders. ""We will continue to fight for our dead friends,"" said speaker Delaney Tarr, a Parkland student. This video can not be played ""He pulls out a silver pistol and points it in my face"" - student Mya Middleton speaks of her chilling encounter with a gunman Some came from children who are just 11 years old, including Naomi Wadler, from Virginia, who spoke ""to represent African-American girls whose stories don't make the front page of every national newspaper"". The 11-year-old American with a rallying cry By Marianna Brady, BBC News, Washington The crowds started to gather in the early hours of the morning outside the US Capitol. Chants for ""no more NRA"" and ""no more guns"" erupt every few minutes at random. ""He was my soulmate,"" said Victoria Gonzalez, looking down at a sign of her boyfriend Joaquin Oliver. Valentine's Day - 14 February - started off as a great day for Victoria. ""Joaquin and I exchanged gifts in the morning and he walked me to class. I was so happy."" Later that day, she would learn that Joaquin was one of 17 people shot and killed at Marjory Stoneman Douglas school. ""It wasn't real,"" she said, standing in a crowd of several thousand ahead of the march. ""It's taken a while for it to sink in. I'm here today so no-one ever has to face this again. It gives me a lot of hope seeing how many people are out here supporting us. It feels like the whole entire world is on our side,"" Victoria said. Read on: 'It feels like the world is on our side' The 14 February massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parklandwas one of a long line of school shootings in the US but the worst since Sandy Hook in 2012, when 26 people were killed. Campaigning by Parkland students gained widespread support, with Ms Gonzalez one of the most outspoken figures, gaining more than a million Twitter followers in a matter of weeks. A tearful Emma Gonzalez during her minutes of silence Survivors of other shootings have also joined the movement, alongside relatives of gun violence victims and anyone moved by their stories. The students staged a nationwide school walk-outearlier this month. They want to seize on public outrage to convince US politicians to take decisive action such as banning the sale of assault weapons. The teenagers taking on the US gun lobby On Thursday,16-year-old Jaelynn Willey died, after being shot in the head by a classmate in Maryland earlier in the week. A second student was injured in the attack. Although the turnout during Saturday's marches has been huge, the issue still divides Americans. The right to bear arms is protected under the second amendment of the US constitution and the National Rifle Association (NRA) gun lobby remains highly influential. Why I'm marching on Washington America's gun culture in 10 charts On Saturday afternoon, the White House released a statement praising the ""many courageous young Americans exercising their First Amendment rights today"". It outlined steps the government is taking to tackle gun violence: Banning bump stocks (devices which allow semi-automatic rifles to fire like machine-guns) Enacting the STOP School Violence Act, which seeks to improve school security Increasing training for students, staff and local law enforcement. Improving criminal background records so gun buyers are properly vetted before making a purchase Some protesters were disappointed that President Donald Trump, who is at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida for the weekend, did not personally tweet a message of support during the protests. What do young conservatives think? This video can not be played Sandy Hook survivors march with Parkland There were protests all across the nation, from New York and Los Angeles to Houston and Anchorage, Alaska. A demonstration was also held in Parkland, with relatives of the victims speaking to crowds. In Scotland, families affected by the 1996 school shooting in Dunblane helda solidarity gathering outside the US consulate in Edinburgh. In London, several hundred people - a mix of US immigrants and allies - also met at the new US embassy in Vauxhall.

The NRA sued the state, saying the law was unconstitutional Several major companies cut ties with the NRAamid a #BoycottNRA campaign, while chains like Walmart and Dick's Sporting Goodsannounced new restrictions on gun sales. Some 69% of Americans think gun laws should be tightened, according to a new poll by the Associated Press and the NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, up from 61% in October 2016.

'Largest ever increase' in maternity staff,"More than 3,000 places on midwifery training courses are to be created over the next four years in England as part of plans to meet NHS staffing demands. The government has announced a 25% boost in training places, which it said amounted to the ""largest ever"" increase in NHS midwives and maternity staff. It followsa similar plan for nurses which was announced last year. The Royal College of Midwives welcomed the move but said training more midwives was only half of the problem. The plan needs investment and time to make it work, the RCM added. An extra 650 midwifery training places will be created next year, followed by 1,000 new places for the three subsequent years. The news came after midwives, along with more than one million NHS staff,were offered pay increases of at least 6.5% over three years. The Â£97m bill for 'midwife shortage' The making of a male midwife Meet the 'backpack midwife' bringing healthcare for all Call to expand pro-breastfeeding scheme Health and Social Care Secretary Jeremy Hunt will officially announce the measures at an event on Tuesday. Alongside the increase in training places, Mr Hunt will promise mothers that they will be seen by the same midwife throughout labour, pregnancy and birth by 2021. Appearing on ITV's Peston on Sunday, Mr Hunt said ""continuity of carers"" could potentially save 700 babies' lives a year and prevent a further 500 from being born with brain damage, but ""it needs more midwives"". He said: ""We know we need to make maternity care safer."" The maternity support worker role will also be developed with national set standards It is part of his ongoing ambition to make the NHS ""the safest place in the world to give birth"" and halve the rate of stillbirths, neonatal and maternal deaths and brain injuries during birth by 2025, the Department of Health said. Mr Hunt will also announce plans to develop the role of maternity support workers (MSW) by creating set national standards that they must adhere to. New training routes into midwifery will also be introduced. By Nick Triggle, BBC health correspondent Increasing student midwife numbers is the easy bit. As the government has scrapped the bursary for midwives, it is much less costly to the public purse to increase the number of places. Filling them when student midwives now have to pay fees may be another matter. But even if this is achieved, it doesn't guarantee the midwife workforce will grow. Over the last five years 7,700 newly-qualified midwives have joined the profession. But the numbers leaving - either because of retirement or, increasingly, quitting the NHS - reached 8,900. In fact, the only reason the workforce was able to increase over that period - by 1,500 to 22,500 - was because the NHS was able to recruit midwives from abroad. If the NHS cannot improve its ability to keep staff - and the pay deal announced last week is only likely to help to some extent - the rise in student numbers will have a limited impact. The Royal College of Midwivesestimates that services in England are 3,500 midwives short.,external Chief executive of the RCM, Gill Walton, called the latest move ""a very long overdue acknowledgement"" of the need for more midwives. ""This announcement must be welcomed,"" she said. ""It will come as some relief to NHS midwives who have been working incredibly hard, for many years, with increasing demands and inadequate resources."" But Ms Walton warned the measures were ""ambitious"" and would ""not transform maternity services right now"", adding the extra recruited midwives would not qualify until 2022. She added: ""Simply training more midwives is only half of the problem.

'Feels like the world is on our side',"Joaquin's last photo on his Instagram before he was shot was with Victoria Valentine's Day started off as a great day for Victoria Gonzalez. ""Joaquin and I exchanged gifts in the morning and he walked me to class. I was so happy,"" she said. Later that day, Victoria, 17, would learn that her boyfriend, Joaquin Oliver, was one of 17 people shot and killed at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. ""It was a nightmare. We didn't get answers about Joaquin until two in the morning,"" said Joaquin's cousin Mariana Rocha, bouncing her year-old son on her hip at the March for Our Lives rally in Washington DC. The 29-year-old Marjory Stoneman Douglas alumna said she is now too afraid to put her young son in school and will instead teach him at home. ""It's just not safe,"" she said as her eyes welled with tears. March for Our Lives: As it happened March For Our Lives: Images from the US and worldwide Students and alumni from the Parkland, Florida school stayed close together in the crowd as thousands gathered around them in the US capital city and in solidarity across 800 cities worldwide. ""Justice for Parkland"" chants rang out and a powerful six-minute speech by survivor, and now activist, Emma Gonzalez, moved the audience. She fell silent for a matter of minutes as tears streamed down her cheeks, before an alarm prompted her to begin speaking again. Six minutes and 20 seconds had passed since she took the stage. That's how long it took the gunman to kill her classmates. A tearful Emma Gonzalez during her minutes of silence School shootings are nothing new in the US. Columbine, Sandy Hook, Virginia Tech - the list continues to grow. But unlike other shootings that flicker in and out of the news, the students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas have turned their grief into a movement since the 14 February massacre. It's the deadliest school shooting since 2012, when 26 people - many of whom were between the ages of six and seven - were killed in Sandy Hook, Connecticut. ""No more silence, end gun violence"" reads Monica's sign Maryland high school student Monica Valdez, 16, said she was inspired by the Parkland survivors and is in Washington DC to make a change. ""I think about hiding spots when I walk into school. It's not normal. We shouldn't have to live like this,"" she said. Some may attribute the momentum for gun control to this young generation's social media savviness or charisma, but the Parkland students have managed to amass millions of followers in their fight against guns. Young people from across the nation spoke out on Saturday about how guns have plagued their childhoods. This video can not be played ""He pulls out a silver pistol and points it in my face"" - student Mya Middleton speaks of her chilling encounter with a gunman ""If the Parkland kids hadn't started this none of this would have happened. We've never had this kind of a movement for gun control,"" said Bonnie Crawford, 40, who flew in from Portland, Oregon to join the march. ""I'm totally inspired by these students,"" said John Newman, 77. ""Now we just need to get these young people to get out and vote for new politicians that will change the laws"". The 11-year-old inspiring a nation Huge gun-control rallies sweep US But people across the country remain divided on a solution to gun violence. While some call for the ban of military-style assault weapons and even guns altogether, others seek to arm teachers and officers in schools as a means of protection. Hannah Snelling, 19, was a survivor of a school shooting two years ago and is now at university studying to become a teacher. Hannah Snelling and her mother, Susan She said that many of her classes are filled with discussions about how to protect students, not teach them. ""You can't stop violence with more violence,"" said Hannah, who favours stricter gun laws and travelled from rural Ohio for the march. Anne Riley, a former police officer, says she's against machine guns Former police officer and current gun owner Anne Riley said, ""I'm not in favour of guns"". ""People get killed more than guns are used for safety in this country,"" the 80-year-old said. People marched around the world to have their voices heard But once the streets are emptied, the stages torn down and the protest signs piled up in trash bins after Saturday's march, the Marjory Stoneman Douglas students say they will keep going. Victoria still says Valentine's Day morning before Joaquin was killed was the happiest she'd ever been. On the last Instagram photo he posted before he died, Joaquin wrote about Victoria: ""Thank you lord for putting a greater blessing than I could ever imagine into my life this past year. I love you with all my heart bub, I could never thank you enough for all you have done for me."" Victoria marched with friends and held a sign of her late, Joaquin Oliver ""I'm very thankful,"" Victoria said of their last hours together. ""It gives me a lot of hope seeing how many people are out here supporting us,"" she said as she looked at the surrounding crowd. ""It feels like the whole entire world is on our side.""

"Over 3,000 more midwives to be trained","More than 3,000 places on midwifery training courses are to be created over the next four years in England as part of plans to meet NHS staffing demands. The government has announced a 25% boost in training places, which it said amounted to the ""largest ever"" increase in NHS midwives and maternity staff. It followsa similar plan for nurses which was announced last year. The Royal College of Midwives welcomed the move but said training more midwives was only half of the problem. The plan needs investment and time to make it work, the RCM added. An extra 650 midwifery training places will be created next year, followed by 1,000 new places for the three subsequent years. The news came after midwives, along with more than one million NHS staff,were offered pay increases of at least 6.5% over three years. The Â£97m bill for 'midwife shortage' The making of a male midwife Meet the 'backpack midwife' bringing healthcare for all Call to expand pro-breastfeeding scheme Health and Social Care Secretary Jeremy Hunt will officially announce the measures at an event on Tuesday. Alongside the increase in training places, Mr Hunt will promise mothers that they will be seen by the same midwife throughout labour, pregnancy and birth by 2021. Appearing on ITV's Peston on Sunday, Mr Hunt said ""continuity of carers"" could potentially save 700 babies' lives a year and prevent a further 500 from being born with brain damage, but ""it needs more midwives"". He said: ""We know we need to make maternity care safer."" The maternity support worker role will also be developed with national set standards It is part of his ongoing ambition to make the NHS ""the safest place in the world to give birth"" and halve the rate of stillbirths, neonatal and maternal deaths and brain injuries during birth by 2025, the Department of Health said. Mr Hunt will also announce plans to develop the role of maternity support workers (MSW) by creating set national standards that they must adhere to. New training routes into midwifery will also be introduced. By Nick Triggle, BBC health correspondent Increasing student midwife numbers is the easy bit. As the government has scrapped the bursary for midwives, it is much less costly to the public purse to increase the number of places. Filling them when student midwives now have to pay fees may be another matter. But even if this is achieved, it doesn't guarantee the midwife workforce will grow. Over the last five years 7,700 newly-qualified midwives have joined the profession. But the numbers leaving - either because of retirement or, increasingly, quitting the NHS - reached 8,900. In fact, the only reason the workforce was able to increase over that period - by 1,500 to 22,500 - was because the NHS was able to recruit midwives from abroad. If the NHS cannot improve its ability to keep staff - and the pay deal announced last week is only likely to help to some extent - the rise in student numbers will have a limited impact. The Royal College of Midwivesestimates that services in England are 3,500 midwives short.,external Chief executive of the RCM, Gill Walton, called the latest move ""a very long overdue acknowledgement"" of the need for more midwives. ""This announcement must be welcomed,"" she said. ""It will come as some relief to NHS midwives who have been working incredibly hard, for many years, with increasing demands and inadequate resources."" But Ms Walton warned the measures were ""ambitious"" and would ""not transform maternity services right now"", adding the extra recruited midwives would not qualify until 2022. She added: ""Simply training more midwives is only half of the problem.

Tributes paid for hostage-swap policemanFrance mourns an officer who died saving the lives of hostages held by an Islamist gunman.9h9 hours agoEurope,"Lt Col Beltrame suffered fatal injuries after volunteering to trade places with a female hostage Tributes are pouring in for a French police officer who died saving the lives of hostages in a supermarket siege by an Islamist gunman on Friday. Lt Col Arnaud Beltrame, 44, was shot and stabbed after he traded places with one of the captives following a shooting spree in southern France. Flags are being flown at half-mast at gendarmerie bases across France. His brother Cedric said Col Beltrame ""didn't have a chance"", adding that his actions were ""beyond the call of duty"". ""He gave his life for strangers. He must have known that he didn't really have a chance. If that doesn't make him a hero, I don't know what would,"" Col Beltrame's brother Cedric told a French radio station on Saturday. Speaking to the BBC, Col Beltrame's cousin Florence Nicolic described the officeras a person who was ""so good at his job"". ""Even though we were surprised and shocked when we heard what happened we were not surprised in the sense that that's the thing he would do without hesitation,"" Ms Nicolic said. The supermarket was sealed off by police as the siege unfolded French President Emmanuel Macron also paid tribute to the officer, saying that Col Beltrame ""fell as a hero"" after showing ""exceptional courage and selflessness"", adding that he deserved ""the respect and admiration of the whole nation"". UK PM Theresa May said the ""sacrifice and courage"" of the police officer would not be forgotten. His actions helped bring an end to the siege that left three people dead. The radical Islamist gunman, 25-year-old Redouane Lakdim, was eventually shot and killed by police. Sixteen people were injured, two seriously, in what Mr Macron called an act of ""Islamist terrorism"". Lakdim was said to have demanded the release of Salah Abdeslam, the most important surviving suspect in the 13 November 2015 attacks in Paris, which killed 130 people. Prosecutors are reportedly questioning two people in connection with the attacks, one of whom is thought to be the gunman's partner while the other is believed to be a friend. Col Beltrame was a highly-regarded member of the Gendarmerie Nationale and was described by France's president on Saturday as someone who ""fought until the end and never gave up"". He graduated in 1999 from France's leading military academy in Saint Cyr and in 2003 became one of just a handful of candidates chosen to join the gendarmerie's elite security response group GSIGN. He was deployed to Iraq in 2005 and was later awarded the Cross for Military Valour for his peacekeeping work. On his return to France, Col Beltrame joined the country's Republican Guard and was tasked with protecting the presidential palace. In 2017, he was named deputy chief of the Gendarmerie Nationale in the French region of Aude, home to the medieval town of Carcassonne, where Lakdim began his deadly shooting spree on Friday. As recently as December, Col Beltrame took part in a simulated terror attack on a local supermarket in the region. Col Beltrame becomes the seventh member of France's security forces to be killed in such attacks since 2012. The violence began on Friday morning in Carcassonne, where Lakdim hijacked a car. He killed a passenger - whose body was later found hidden in a bush - and injured the driver. He then shot at a group of policemen who were out jogging, wounding one of them. This video can not be played Eye-witness says French hostage-taker ran after him Lakdim is then believed to have driven a short distance to the small town of TrÃ¨bes, where he stormed into the Super-U supermarket, shouting, ""I am a soldier of Daesh [Islamic State]!"" He killed two people - a customer and a store worker - before seizing others as hostages. Mr Collomb told reporters on Friday that police officers had managed to get some people out of the supermarket but the gunman had held one woman back as a human shield. It was at this point, he said, that Col Beltrame had volunteered to swap himself for her. As he did so, he left his mobile phone on a table with an open line so that police outside could monitor the situation. When police heard gunshots, a tactical team stormed the supermarket. The gunman was killed and Col Beltrame was mortally wounded. After the announcement of his death early on Saturday,France's Gendarmerie Nationale - a police force part of the military - honoured its fallen ""comrade"",external, saying Col Beltrame ""gave his life for the freedom of the hostages"". Lakdim, was born in April 1992 in Morocco and had French nationality. He was known to French intelligence services. Prosecutor Francois Molins said Lakdim had been on an extremist watch-list due to ""his radicalisation and his links with the Salafist movement"", a hardline offshoot of Sunni Islam. However, subsequent investigations by intelligence services had not turned up any signs he would act, he said. In 2011, Lakdim was found guilty of carrying a prohibited weapon and in 2015 he was convicted for drug use and refusing a court order, Mr Molins said. Earlier, Mr Collomb said that though Lakdim had been known to authorities as a petty criminal, they ""did not think he had been radicalised"". Lakdim lived in an apartment in Carcassonne with his parents and several sisters. A neighbour saw him taking one of his sisters to school on Friday morning. The family's apartment was raided by police on Friday afternoon.

"Plaid pledges independence referendumIn a conference speech, Adam Price called Wales ""a wealthy country whose people live in poverty"".8h8 hours agoWales politics","This video can not be played Adam Price says a poll on Wales' constitutional future would be held after two terms of Plaid government An independence referendum, national air carrier and energy grid would be created under a Plaid Cymru government, the party has said. In a speech at the party's conference in Llangollen, Denbighshire, Adam Price outlined what two terms of a Plaid government would hope to achieve. Mr Price made several proposals for a ""vibrant, confident, successful nation"" to be achieved by 2030. He also called Wales ""a wealthy country whose people live in poverty"". Mr Price, AM for Carmarthen East and Dinefwr, said the party will ""tackle the myth"" Wales is a poor nation by claiming, in terms of per capita income, it is richer than ""every nation in Asia bar two, every nation in the Americas bar two, and richer than more than half of Europe"". Under the pledge, if elected, Plaid Cymru would establish a Wales national carrier with direct connections to the Americas and mainland Europe, create a national energy grid, set up a national housing company and provide free university education for Welsh students. A referendum on Wales' constitutional future would be held at the end of the second term of a Plaid government, which Mr Price said would ""ask this coming generation where they want Wales to be mid-century and will include independence as a realistic option"", he said.

Smith 'stood by principles' on BrexitThe Labour MP says Jeremy Corbyn made a 'mistake' in firing him for calling for a second referendum.15h15 hours agoUK Politics,"This video can not be played Owen Smith says Labour ""needs to speak out strongly"" against the risks of Brexit Owen Smith says he ""stood by his principles"" in calling for another EU referendum - a move which resulted in his sacking from Labour's shadow cabinet. The former shadow Northern Ireland secretary said Jeremy Corbyn had made a ""mistake"" in firing him. He also said the party should ""shift its position"" on Brexit. Mr Smith was asked to stand down on Friday after he wrote an article for the Guardian calling for a second vote. Speaking about his sacking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he said: ""I think it is a mistake, for Jeremy Corbyn in particular, who has always understood the value of people standing by their principles. ""It is the position that he has often adopted, and it is certainly a value in him that others have extolled."" ""In truth I think that is all I have done. I have stood by my principles."" Labour frontbencher backs second EU vote EU adopts guidelines for next Brexit phase Corbyn 'regret' over anti-Semitic mural row Mr Smith said leaving the EU was ""the biggest economic crisis that our country will have faced for many, many generations"" and he believed Labour should stand against it. Referring to Mr Corbyn's views on Brexit as ""a more Eurosceptic position"", he added: ""It's the first instance that I can think of in living memory of a government pursuing a policy that they know is going to make our economy smaller and reduce people's livelihoods and life chances and I cannot understand why we in Labour would support that."" Party figures have criticised Mr Corbyn's decision to sack Mr Smith, with Labour peer Peter Hain describing the dismissal as a ""Stalinist purge"". The former Northern Ireland secretary said Mr Smith was widely respected for his work in the role. Labour MP Chuka Umunna said it was ""extraordinary"" that the shadow minister had been sacked for advocating a Brexit policy which, he said, had wide support in the party. Fellow MP Anna Turley said Mr Smith's departure was ""disappointing"" and he would be a loss to the front bench, while former cabinet minister Ben Bradshaw told Mr Smith he was ""very sorry"" to see him go. Jeremy Corbyn and Owen Smith went head to head in the 2016 Labour leadership contest By Jonathan Blake, BBC political correspondent In a phone call from Jeremy Corbyn and what a source described as a ""civil conversation"", Owen Smith was told he was being sacked. Mr Smith's comments on Brexit policy were seemingly a step too far for the party leadership, who'd welcomed him back into the fold after his leadership challenge in 2016. The angry response from some MPs has again laid bare their opposition to Jeremy Corbyn as leader. But Mr Corbyn's grip on power in the party has never been stronger. The fact that he can make this move without fear of open rebellion, is a demonstration of that. However shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said although Mr Smith was ""a valued colleague"", he could not sit on the opposition front bench while advancing ""a position which was simply not Labour Party policy"". Ms Abbott, who in November told constituents she would push for a referendum on the final Brexit deal - before clarifying shewanted a Parliamentary vote- said Mr Smith would be able to ""make a contribution to the debate"" outside the shadow cabinet. BBC Newsnight's political editor Nick Watt said supporters of Mr Corbyn thought Mr Smith ""wasn't very collegiate"" and had defied collective responsibility. Mr Watt also reported that friends of Mr Smith complained that journalists knew about the sacking before Mr Corbyn phoned him - a claim disputed by the Labour leader's office. Mr Smith has been replaced by Rochdale MP and shadow housing minister Tony Lloyd. Mr Corbyn said that Mr Lloyd was ""highly experienced"" and ""committed to ensuring that peace in Northern Ireland is maintained"", as well as helping to steer the devolution deal ""back on track"". Tony Lloyd was previously shadow minister for housing, communities and local government In a tweet, Mr Smith said his concerns about Brexit, which he outlined in aGuardian,externalarticle, were shared by other supporters and members of the Labour party.

In the article, Mr Smith called for Labour to back membership of the EU single market. The Labour leader announced last month that the party wanted the UK to be a permanent member of a customs union with the EU after Brexit. But Mr Smith, who unsuccessfully challenged Mr Corbyn for the party leadership in 2016, insisted Labour needed to do more than ""just back a soft Brexit or guarantee a soft border in Ireland"". He wrote: ""If we insist on leaving the EU then there is realistically only one way to honour our obligations under the Good Friday Agreement and that is to remain members of both the customs union and the single market.""
