Arsenal 2-0 Crystal Palace,"Olivier Giroud scored his second goal in as many games Olivier Giroud's incredible scorpion kick set Arsenal on the way to a victory over Crystal Palace which moved them up to third in the Premier League. With a cross from Alexis Sanchez delivered behind him, Frenchman Giroud elastically reached the ball with his left foot, looping it over his head and in off the underside of the bar. An Alex Iwobi header gave Arsenal a scrappy second before Palace briefly rallied to force saves from home goalkeeper Petr Cech. The win moves the Gunners back to within nine points of leaders Chelsea, while Palace stay 17th, two points above the relegation zone. The visitors have won only once in 13 league games, with manager Sam Allardyce awaiting his first victory since taking over from Alan Pardew. Giroud was about 12 yards from goal when he applied his sensational finish to Sanchez's cross Giroud marked his return to the Arsenal starting line-up on Boxing Day by scoring the only goal in the win over West Bromwich Albion, and followed up here by pulling off one of the most memorable moments of this or any other season. Indeed, it was made all the more remarkable for its echoes of a similarly breathtaking goal scored byManchester United's Henrikh Mkhitaryan in the defeat of Sunderland on Monday. If anything, Giroud's was even more impressive, an acrobatic finish to a head-high cross delivered from the left by Sanchez at the end of a pacy Arsenal counter-attack. As the ball arrived, a sprinting Giroud turned to stick out his left foot, flicked the ball over his head and saw it arc over the leap of Palace goalkeeper Wayne Hennessey, off the woodwork and into the net. ""It was an unbelievable finish,"" said former Arsenal defender Martin Keown on BBC Radio 5 live. ""It has to be up there with the goal of the season already. ""He's hooked that with a gadget foot - the ball is behind him and he has no right to get his foot to it."" Olivier Giroud told BBC Sport:""It is not difficult to say it is the best one. I was a bit lucky but it was the only thing I could do, the ball was behind me and I tried to hit it with a backheel. ""Maybe Henrikh Mkhitaryan's goal inspired me, it's the only thing you can do in that position. It is nice for me and the team because we start the year with a win."" Crystal Palace goalkeeper Wayne Hennessey on Sky Sports:""It was a wonder goal - there seems to be a lot going in recently. It's a fantastic strike."" Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger:""It was a great counter-attack at great speed, his reflex surprised everybody who knows football and that's what makes the goal great. ""I have been a bit spoiled over the years by the exceptional quality of the players I've had, but it will be remembered as an exceptional goal. ""Olly is very good in front of goal, but I've never seen this kind of goal from him."" Arsenal lost ground in the title race with defeats by Everton and Manchester City, and began this game in fifth place following Tottenham's win at Watford. Giroud's goal was the highlight of an otherwise lacklustre first half in which the only other moment of note was the Frenchman missing his kick attempting to meet a cross inside the six-yard box. Still, the Gunners' threat was always apparent, particularly in the shape of the forward running of full-backs Hector Bellerin and Nacho Monreal, who tormented the Palace defence throughout. Monreal was involved in the second goal, providing a cross that was not dealt with, Iwobi heading in despite the efforts of Palace defender Joel Ward on the line. Arsenal left-back Nacho Monreal's (18) forward running resulted in his average position being beyond the halfway line, with Palace right-back Martin Kelly (34) pinned way back as a result Palace had the chance to win Allardyce's first match in charge, only for Christian Benteke to have a penalty savedin the 1-1 draw with Watford. At Arsenal, a team Allardyce has never beaten away in 13 Premier League attempts, what he already knew was reinforced - his new team are a threat going forward but need to improve at the back. The 35 goals Palace have conceded is the most by any team outside the relegation zone. Though they were often organised, an inability to deal with Arsenal's movement ensured Hennessey was kept busy and the defending for the home side's second goal was shambolic. After that, Palace had their best spell of pressure. Wilfried Zaha and Andros Townsend provided the drive, with Townsend, Benteke and Yohan Cabaye all calling Cech into action. There is plenty to suggest Palace can move clear of trouble if Allardyce can add his trademark tightness to their backline. ""Our season won't be defined by results against the top six,"" he said. ""What we do when we play the teams in the bottom half of the league will be the defining reason of whether or not we get out of the bottom half. ""I have every confidence in the players that it will turn around and hopefully as quick as possible."" Though Arsenal's full-backs were outstanding, it would be churlish not to single out Olivier Giroud, who produced something quite special Olivier Giroud has scored eight goals in his past six starts for Arsenal in all competitions. Sam Allardyce has never won at Arsenal as a manager in all competitions, drawing four and losing 12 of his 16 visits. Since joining the club, Alexis Sanchez has had a hand in 88 goals for Arsenal in all competitions (56 goals, 32 assists) - 26 more than any other Gunner. Arsenal have won 130 of their 200 Premier League games at the Emirates under Arsene Wenger (65%) - they won 72% of their league games at Highbury under the Frenchman (134/186). The Gunners have kept consecutive Premier League clean sheets at home for the first time this season, last doing so in their final three games of 2015-16. Crystal Palace have failed to keep a clean sheet in their past 20 Premier League away games, since a 0-0 draw at Bournemouth in December 2015. Allardyce has failed to win either of his first two Premier League games in charge of a club for the first time in his career. Both teams are in action on Tuesday.

Leicester 12-16 Saracens,"Owen Farrell scored the game's only try after 54 minutes Aviva Premiership Leicester Tigers (6) 12 Pens:Williams 4 Saracens (6) 16 Try:FarrellCon:FarrellPens:Farrell 3 Owen Farrell scored all of Saracens' points against Leicester, but victory was not enough to return the London club to the top of the Premiership. In a tense first half, during which Leicester's injury-plagued England wingerManu Tuilagi limped off,the scores were locked at 6-6 as Farrell traded penalties with Owen Williams. Farrell scored and converted the only try after adding a further penalty. Williams kicked two penalties to ensure Leicester took a losing bonus point. Relive New Year's Day's Premiership action Varndell equals record as Bristol beat Sale North returns as Saints beat Gloucester Worcester beat Harlequins to stay off bottom Leicester pressed until the final moments as they looked to avoid just their second defeat in 15 home games in all competitions, but two missed penalties from Williams proved costly. In a game England boss Eddie Jones watched from the stand, much attention was focused on centre Tuilagi, who was called up on Saturday for a national team training camp. But it proved little more than a cameo showing by the 25-year-old as he was forced off with an apparent right knee injury, suffered as he came down in a tackle. Saracens were dealt a setback of their own as winger Chris Ashton - making his first start in 15 weeks after servinga suspension for biting -was forced off after a clash of heads with Jack Roberts. However, despite losing the prolific Ashton, Saracens came up with the game's only try soon after - Brad Barritt collecting the ball from Williams after a poor Ben Youngs pass before Farrell threw a dummy to race clear. Saracens did enough to hold on for the win, moving them to within one point of Wasps at the summit. Leicester director of rugby Richard Cockerill:""It was tight, we played very well, they played well. We defended outstandingly well and our set-piece was dominant. ""Saracens' pack don't get dominated very often but we dominated their pack today. Our boys were fantastic. ""There are a lot of positives. I know we are five points from the top four but we were playing the best side in Europe last season. ""If we can play like that away we will win more than we lose and we will keep in the mix."" Saracens director of rugby Mark McCall:""We are chuffed to bits to come here and win where they have not lost this season. ""Not everything in our game was perfect, far from it. But what was tremendous was the fight we had and the effort we showed all the way through the game. ""We had to win without a platform because our scrum today was poor. To get a result without a scrum is tough."" Leicester Tigers:Burns; Betham, Roberts, Tuilagi, Thompstone; O. Williams, B. Youngs; Genge, T. Youngs (c), Cole, Slater, Fitzgerald, M.

New pound in circulation from March,"The new 12-sided Â£1 coin is said to be the 'most secure in the world' The new 12-sided Â£1 coin will enter circulation on 28 March, the government has said. The round Â£1 will be legal tender alongside the new, more-secure coin until 15 October. The public are being urged to use their current Â£1 coins or bank them before they lose their legal tender status. The government estimates around a third of the Â£1.3 billion worth of coins stored in piggy banks or saving jars around the UK are the current Â£1 style. Some of those returned by the public will be melted down and used to make the 12-sided version. The new stylewas announced in the 2014 budgetand has been billed by the Royal Mint as ""the most secure coin in the world"". 12-sided - its distinctive shape means it stands out by sight and by touch Bimetallic -  The outer ring is gold coloured (nickel-brass) and the inner ring is silver coloured (nickel-plated alloy) Latent image - it has an image like a hologram that changes from a 'Â£' symbol to the number '1' when the coin is seen from different angles Micro-lettering - around the rim on the heads side of the coin tiny lettering reads: ONE POUND. On the tails side you can find the year the coin was produced Milled edges - it has grooves on alternate sides Hidden high security feature - an additional security feature is built into the coin to protect it from counterfeiting but details have not been revealed The public can expect to see the new designs in their pockets in spring 2017 Its introduction will come as a new set of coin designs are also brought into circulation, celebrating the achievements of Jane Austen and Sir Isaac Newton. The Royal Mint said the new designs have a ""strong pioneering theme"" and will start appearing this spring. A Jane Austen Â£2 coin will celebrate the author 200 years after her death, while another Â£2 version will remember the Royal Flying Corps. A 50p coin will mark the achievements of mathematician Sir Isaac Newton, a one-time Master of the Royal Mint. Dr Kevin Clancy, director of the Royal Mint Museum, said: ""This is a particularly significant year in Royal Mint history as we welcome in the new 12-sided Â£1 coin, with its innovative security features. ""This year we also mark the achievements of Jane Austen, Sir Isaac Newton and the Royal Flying Corps - all pioneers in their own field.""

'Hollywood' sign changed to 'Hollyweed',"The iconic sign was changed overnight on New Year's Eve Residents of Los Angeles' most famous neighbourhood woke up on New Year's Day to find the world-famous Hollywood sign had been changed to read ""Hollyweed"". Local media reported that police were treating the incident as minor trespass and were investigating. The sign on Mount Lee is made of 45-foot (13.7m) tall letters. Voters in California approved the legalisation of marijuana in a ballot held at the same time as the presidential election - on 8 November. The prank has not caused lasting damage to the sign, however, as parts of both ""O"" letters were covered by tarpaulins to make them look like a lower-case letter ""E"". The Los Angeles Times reports,externalthat a single person was recorded on security cameras climbing the sign to hang the materials.

Young players' pay concerns Southgate,"England have won two and drawn two of Gareth Southgate's four games in charge England manager Gareth Southgate fears young players are not reaching their potential because they get ""big money for achieving nothing"". Former England Under-21 boss Southgate, 46, says youngsters thinking they have ""already made it"" is a ""concern"". However, he believes ""top"" players will still come through - because they have drive and determination. ""If you don't have that inner drive there's a danger you'll never be a top professional,"" he told the BBC. Listen to the full interview onSportsweek. The 2016Global Sports Salaries Survey,externalfound the average basic wage of a Premier League player was Â£2.4m a year, or Â£48,766 a week. Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho has spoken in the past of young playersbeing made ""rich before they have played one Premier League game"".,external And Liverpool, Southampton and Tottenham are among the clubs to havecapped the earnings,externalof young players in an attempt to make them focus on their football. Southgate, who played 57 times for England, also told BBC Radio 5 live's Sportsweek programme: England need to show more humility He wants to take pressure off captain Wayne Rooney by finding more ""leaders"" He wants to help his players become mentally stronger He wants to excite England fans - and make them proud of their team Southgate, who took charge afterSam Allardyce's departurein September, is concerned by the amount of money paid to young players before they become first-team regulars. He cited Real Madrid forward Cristiano Ronaldo and Barcelona attacker Lionel Messi as the type of players who are ""not distracted"" by money as ""their desire is to win trophies and be the best player they can be"". He said: ""The very best players have that drive and that's why they get to the top. The concern is for any young player at an academy, who's not quite made it in the first team, but thinks they have because you get big money for having achieved nothing. ""If you don't have that inner drive, there's a danger you'll never actually get to be a top professional or be a first-team player. ""For a short period of time that won't have any impact on them financially, but in years to come they could look back and have huge regrets."" Ronaldo and Messi are widely regarded as the best two footballers in the world Southgate has said Wayne Rooney willremain as England captain,though the Manchester United forward, 31, was only a substitute for the World Cup qualifier against Slovenia in October. Southgate, who captained Aston Villa, Crystal Palace and Middlesbrough during his playing career, wants Rooney's team-mates to ""step forward"". He added: ""In the team I played in at Euro '96, there were probably seven of us who were captains of our clubs. You need strong characters, not only to make decisions but when the game's going against you. ""At different moments you've got to have different people take that lead, whether that's being brave enough to take the ball or talking to the others, getting them mentally back on course. ""A lot of that responsibility over the last few years has fallen on Wayne Rooney's shoulders; that's got to be shared, that's got to be developed and that's not just on the field but off the field in particular."" Southgate added he had already seen ""potential leaders"" in his four matches in charge. Joe Hart (left), Jordan Henderson (centre) and Gary Cahill have all captained England England playershave been banned by the Football Association from having nights outwhile on international duty. It came after newspaper reports several players were at a nightclub in the early hours of the morning after the 3-0 win over Scotland in November. Rooney, meanwhile, was pictured with members of a wedding party at the team's hotel. Southgate said players are ""far more dedicated"" than during his career - and he should not have to control them. ""We live in a world where everyone has a camera phone, everybody has access to social media and anything you do is out in a very public manner very quickly so players have to recognise that,"" he said. ""You set a culture, an environment and the players have to be involved in that. I can discipline people, but that has a short-term effect. ""A disciplined life in sport is when an athlete or a player decides how they're going to commit themselves to their training, commits themselves to living their life, and you're letting your team-mates down if you don't adhere to that. For me, it's not controlling the players - the environment should create that."" Southgate as England manager 8 October 2016:England 2-0 Malta 11 October 2016:Slovenia0-0 England 11 November 2016:England 3-0 Scotland 15 November 2016:England 2-2 Spain Southgate, who played for England at three major tournaments, says one of his priorities is to develop the mental strength of his players. The Three Lions, then under Roy Hodgson, went out of Euro 2016 at the last-16 stage with a2-1 defeat by Iceland. ""When I was playing, we went into tournaments as one of the favourites, and over the last few years we've been going in hope rather than as one of the top-ranked teams,"" said Southgate. ""Tournaments will always be at the end of the season so we have to get the physical load right in the way we train, maintain fitness levels at the highest possible but also maintain freshness. ""The mental peaking is key and there are things we can work on to help that develop. Mental resilience is generally a product of the experiences you have been through in your life and some of those will be on the sports field and some outside of sport. ""We cannot just rely on the 10 or 12 fixtures a year, we have to develop that."" Manchester United striker Marcus Rashford, then aged 18, scored on his England debut in May Southgatesigned a four-year contractin November after four matches in interim charge. The deal will take him through the 2018 World Cup and 2020 European Championship, the final of which will be at Wembley. England have not reached the quarter-finals of a major competition since Euro 2012, and Southgate wants to make fans of the national side proud. ""People will judge our success on the outcome of European Championships and the World Cup,"" he said. ""But, for me, every time we get together we have to get better. If in two years' time we've got a team that excites the supporters and they are proud of, we're heading in the right direction."" Southgate said the style of play his players adopted was ""important"" but acknowledged ""ultimately we have to win"". ""There is a desire to play a possession-based game. I think our top teams are playing in a fashion with a high-pressing game, so when players come with England why would we ask them to do something completely different?"" he said. ""There's also a desire to excite the public - we are in a sport where people pay a lot of money to come and watch and they want an England team that excites them. ""We've got some really exciting potential - we've got some very exciting players to come through."" England are 13th in the Fifa rankings, and have not been in the top five since March 2013. Southgate says some ""humility"" would ""not be a bad thing"". ""We're 13th in the world rankings and at the last two tournaments we haven't got through a knockout game,"" he added. ""There are some obstacles we have to overcome but for me that's a great opportunity and the potential is huge. ""I don't have any fear in what lies ahead because I'm just seeing what's possible. How do we go to being the number one team in the world? ""We've got to deliver, we've got to work hard, we've got to work intelligently. I'm looking at what's achievable, I'm not thinking about anything else."" Southgate became the third man to manage England in 2016 when he replaced Allardyce Hodgson, who resigned following the shock defeat by Iceland in June, last month told Sportsweekthe England job had left him scarred. ""I can understand that because I had that when I lost my job at Middlesbrough as a young coach,"" Southgate said. ""The things that don't go right will always be there as part of your life but it's how you respond that determines what you're going to be as a person and coach. We would ask our players to rebound from those moments and to be stronger for them - that applies to coaches as well."" Southgate says he had no reservations about taking the job, and his family are ""fully supportive"". ""My wife's lived through my playing career so she's suffered enough over the years - so what's to fear?"" he said. ""One of the outcomes of the playing career I had is that I was disappointed not to win the things I wanted to. I won a few trophies, I won some caps, but not as many as I wanted to. ""You always want to prove people wrong, you want the opportunity to show people you have the resilience to bounce back from those things. ""It's about what's possible, what's achievable - otherwise why would you take on any role? There's a moment where you feel all the experiences in life you've had, now's the moment to step forward and lead."" 'Draconian' rules not suitable - Southgate Southgate outlines England philosophy.

Papers start 2017 with stories on IS and Brexit,"Events in Turkey came too late for the early editions of the morning papers. TheSunday Times,externalleads with a warning from Home Office minister Ben Wallace that the self-styled Islamic State group could be planning a chemical weapons attack on the UK. In an interview, Mr Wallace - who is responsible for security - says that while no specific plot has been identified, mass casualty attacks are an ambition for IS, which has reportedly used poison gas in Syria and Iraq. The newspaper says that the risk of such an attack in Britain was noted last month by Europol, but this is the first time that a minister has highlighted the threat. The main story for the Sunday Telegraph is the threat ofextremists taking over charities,externalto pursue violence. It says the number of times the Charity Commission has referred concerns to the police and other agencies has almost trebled in three years to 630 - a record figure. The Commission's chairman, William Shawcross, is calling for Muslim charities to help tackle threats of infiltration. The Observer is predicting cross-party opposition in the Lords next week to thegovernment's plans for higher education.,external It says Labour, the Liberal Democrats and independent cross-bench peers have joined forces to scupper legislation that would make it easier for new colleges to award degrees, become universities and make profits from teaching. Critics fear the reforms would lower standards, but ministers argue that they will widen access. The Mail on Sunday keeps up its attack on foreign aid spending, reporting that more than Â£2m has been used to improve working conditions for farmers and factory workers in poorer countries. The paper is outraged that grants were given to supermarkets, ""which make huge profits each year"", to provide training and healthcare to their overseas suppliers. ""Are they off their trolleys?"",externalasks the headline. The Department for International Development says the projects help developing countries' efforts to trade their way out of poverty. TheSunday Express,externalagrees with Theresa May that 2017 is a time for opportunity, not fear. It talks of relishing the chance to change the country. The Sun on Sunday applauds the prime minister's call for unity, but sayswishing for it won't make it so,external. It calls on those it says are ""still in denial about Brexit"" to ""stop and wake up"". The Sunday Telegraph tells Mrs May she muststart making choices,externaland set out a clear case for the kind of Britain that will result from Brexit. It argues that the British people will respond positively if she is ""direct and courageous"". The papers mark the New Year in traditional fashion, with spectacular photographs of firework displays around the world. The Sunday Mirror says the Australian city of Sydney put on a""Purple Rainbow"",externalas a tribute to the late music star, Prince. The Mail on Sunday has a photo of armed police in London - part of a big security operation which it says ""didn't spoil the 2017 party"". Among the predictions, both theSun on Sunday,externaland the Mail on Sunday are tipping marriage for Prince Harry.

Secrets of success,"It's important to have achievable goals After the excesses of the festive season, the thoughts of many turn to making resolutions to stop bad habits and take up healthier ones. Unfortunately, quite a few fail. But there are some psychological tactics which can be employed to increase the chances of success. Psychologist Prof Richard Wiseman, from the University of Hertfordshire, has carried out research into the key to sticking to resolutions. In a study of 5,000 people who made resolutions, it was those with a ""fatalistic attitude"" who were less likely to succeed. He advises it's more than likely old habits will creep back in sometimes, so see those occasions as temporary set-backs and not a reason to give up altogether. ""Failure is the main thing that stops people  If, on day one of their diet, they raid the biscuit tin, they think 'that's it' and give up. But persistence is the key. Start again the next day."" Support from friends and family can help people stick to their goals. But Prof Wiseman says women might be more likely to benefit. ""They are generally better at offering moral support. Men tend to try and encourage you to have more dessert."" Noting down progress can help This can be something public like a blog - or the fridge door - or more privately, in a spreadsheet or a journal. It might help to note down each gym visit, or decision not to have cake. Prof Wisemanalso advises,externalhaving a checklist to show how life will be better once your goals are achieved - and allow small rewards throughout the process to keep up motivation levels. It has to be something specific that can be realistically achieved. Running a marathon, say, would be too much for a non-runner to aim for, while a vague desire to 'get fit' is hard to measure. ""Maybe start by saying you'll go to the gym once a week, then you can look at moving up to two,"" advises Prof Wiseman. And be realistic - it's best to choose one thing to focus on rather than having a raft of goals to increase the chances of success. Quitting smoking is a common resolution This is important in terms of knowing what prompts behaviour you want to avoid - and to help encourage healthier habits. ""It could be as simple as not having biscuits in the house so you're not tempted - or understanding the stress triggers that make you reach for a cigarette,"" Prof Wiseman says. And he says it's possible to create new triggers to prompt you in your new, healthier habits. ""You can decide that when the news starts, that's the time when you set off for the gym"".

Second calling,"Most of the red phone boxes seen on the streets are the K6 model, known as the Jubilee Kiosk because it was designed in honour of the Silver Jubilee of King George V The red telephone box was once a common sight across the land, a design so associated with Britishness that tourists would be as likely to pose beside one for a photo than to step inside to make a call. But with the rise of the mobile phone, the redundant kiosks are increasingly being put to inventive uses, from miniature art galleries to pint-sized pubs. A decline in payphone usage has drastically reduced the number of phone boxes across the UK - according to BT there were 92,000 in 2002, and there are currently 46,000, including 8,000 traditional red ones. While this is a far cry from their 73,000-strong heyday in 1980, fans will be glad to know many redundant red boxes have taken on an afterlife, ranging from the sensibly practical to the downright peculiar. Dial S for snack: Sample a salad in central London, or quaff a coffee in Birmingham End of the pier: Selling souvenirs in Brighton As part of BT's ""adopt a kiosk"" scheme, communities are able to take over a decommissioned telephone kiosk for Â£1. Although new users are not allowed to install ""electronic communications apparatus"", 3,500 have been snapped up and put to a variety of uses. One of the most common, especially in rural areas, is as a lending library or book exchange. This red box in Loweswater, Cumbria, was the 3,000th to be taken over under BTs ""adopt a kiosk"" scheme, and now houses a defibrillator Some have become art galleries, including a rare green kiosk in Barningham, Teesdale. John Hay, from the village, said that when Barningham was offered the kiosk four years ago, nobody knew what to do with it. ""All that was inside it was a beer glass, a crate, half a dozen spiders and a lot of water,"" he said. ""I cleared it out - though I left the spiders, which I suspect are still there - and put in a Christmas tree, which must have convinced villagers I was well and truly mad."" The green kiosk in Barningham has featured in an Italian travel company's brochure It was the first of a series of regular displays, including local artworks, seasonal celebrations and a display marking the anniversary of the Battle of the Somme. Mr Hay said: ""There has been a lot of interest with passing walkers, and an Italian travel company actually put us in their brochure. ""It mentioned Buckingham Palace, and Barningham and its phone box."" In the Cambridgeshire village of Shepreth, the redundant kiosk briefly became a pub, as part of a protest at plans to turn the closed local into housing. For one night onlyvillagers were able to enjoy a pint at the Dog and Bone. Want to withdraw a few pounds or pull a pint or two? Why not pop along to a phone box Tinsel time: The kiosk in Prickwillow, Cambridgeshire - a miniature art gallery - takes on a Christmas theme at this time of year On the commercial front, The Red Kiosk Company leases out decommissioned phone boxes, offering the chance to ""run your own business out of an iconic red kiosk"". Edward Ottewell, one of the founders, said: ""One advantage of regenerating them is that they are refurbished to their original state, and their use prevents vandalism - all of our tenanted sites have had zero damage."" He said coffee shops were a popular choice, and there were now office ""pods"", offering access to facilities such as the internet. Prototype was produced in concrete in 1920 In 1924 Sir Giles Gilbert Scott won a competition to design a new model His original colour was silver, but the Post Office changed this to red He also designed Liverpool Anglican Cathedral, Battersea Power Station, and Bankside Power Station (now the Tate Modern) The K6 model, commissioned in 1935 to commemorate the Silver Jubilee of King George V, is the most common, with 60,000 installed About 2,400 phone boxes have been designated as Grade II-listed buildings They are also a familiar sight on the streets of Malta, Bermuda and Gibraltar One of the most recent lets was to a mobile phone repair shop business in Greenwich, south-east London. Lessee Rob Kerr, from Lovefone, said: ""We've had a great response from the community, and the technician has kept his sanity working in a one-square-metre shop."" Community lending libraries are relatively common, but the mobile phone repair shop is the first of its kind But as yet, no company seems to have taken up an idea put forward by a resident of the Northumberland village of Ovington. When its kiosk was adopted by the parish councillocals were invited to come up with suggestions as to its future use. Among them was the world's smallest lap-dancing bar, although this was rejected in favour of a container for a defibrillator. Designer Sir Giles Gilbert Scott was also responsible for Liverpool Anglican Cathedral It is not the only one - defibrillators are now housed in more than 3,000 kiosks, due to the efforts of the Community Heartbeat Trust. Martin Fagan, from the trust, said: ""With something as serious as a cardiac arrest, time is of the essence, and, unfortunately, ambulance services often can't reach country villages in time. ""To install defibrillators in disused phone boxes is ideal, as they're often in the centre of the village, and it means the iconic red kiosk can remain a lifeline for the community.""

Lost billions,"A bumper lottery draw was organised following Team GB's success in the Rio Olympics A glorious summer of sunshine and sporting success should have been even better for more than a dozen lottery players. Thirteen winning tickets in the National Lottery draw of 27 August remain unclaimed - five of them are Â£1m wins. It was a bumper draw that day. There were 67 extra winners in addition to the normal 21 prizes owing to a raffle draw celebrating Team GB's success at the Rio Olympics. It may have been that players failed to check those extra draw details. It may have been that they were away from home as it was a Bank Holiday weekend in much of the UK. Either way Â£5.6m is going to lottery good causes if those winners do not make a claim in the next couple of months. Overall, only 3% of National Lottery prizes go unclaimed. That is a fraction of the sum that people miss out on through unclaimed benefits or compensation. In today's automated world, why do many of these payouts still require people to make a complaint and a claim? Nearly Â£2bn in redress was paid to consumers of financial services in the first half of the year. While the industry watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority, holds data on the success of compensation schemes in reaching those entitled to payouts, it does not publish all of it. One of the biggest unknowns is the number of people affected by mis-sold payment protection insurance (PPI), and the amount they should receive. This loan insurance was sold on an industrial scale to people who did not want or need it, or who could not claim. As a result banks have paid out Â£25bn in compensation in the past few years. Estimates suggest the total bill, were all sales paid back, could be Â£100bn. An estimated nine million people in the UK could still make a complaint. So why not simply pay everyone back? The reason is clear from consultation into a proposed deadline for PPI compensation claims. ""We remain of the view that not all PPI was mis-sold and that, properly sold, PPI could meet some consumers' genuine credit protection needs,"" the FCA says during the consultation. So, the FCA says that, in effect, every case must be taken on its merits, and that requires people to make a complaint, despite consumer groups claiming that a huge number of mis-selling victims are missing out. ""We do not consider that there are strong grounds to significantly depart from this complaints-led approach now,"" the FCA adds. One of the most controversial compensation cases was the payouts for those mis-sold credit card and identity theft protection by insurer CPP. Seven million people were eligible for compensation and received letters inviting them to make a claim for compensation. Some consumer groups argued that the letters looked like junk mail. By the time the claims window expired, more than four million people had missed out. Only a third of those eligible received compensation, averaging Â£190 each. Just one submitted claim was rejected. Any kind of dispute that puts the onus on individuals making an initial complaint can be ""incredibly stressful"" says James Walker, founder of consumer website Resolver. ""Lots of the people I speak to tell me they have simply given up. What is frustrating is people don't realise that the rights they have when it comes to taking things further are actually quite strong,"" he says. ""You don't have to suffer in silence for long periods of time if you want to escalate your complaint and there are lots of free ombudsman schemes that can help you."" He points to cases such as a pensioner who parked his car to go to the doctors, oblivious of a parking restriction notice that was obscured by a fence. He received a ticket, followed by debt collection notices, but after more than a year in dispute received Â£350 in refunds and compensation. Despite these cases, there is a move in some industries for compensation to be paid automatically more often. In October last year, Virgin became the first train companyto automatically compensate some passengersif they are delayed. Travellers using its services on the West Coast mainline - and who book their tickets via the company app or website - receive automatic repayments. Research has shown that most rail passengers do not bother to claim compensation, even when it is due - a situation that led toa so-called super-complaintby consumers' association Which?. In the airline industry, where passengers must make a claim for compensation following delays, an estimated 70% of those who have a right to a payout do not claim, according to a comparison website. Communications regulator Ofcom is also investigating the use of automatic compensation when phone or internet services fail. At present, customers tend to go through one of two ombudsman services. Proposals to be published by the regulator in the new year are aimed at providing ""easier redress"" when something goes wrong. Arguably, the most significant change in redress for consumers may result from the 2015 Consumer Rights Act. UK consumers may be included automatically in a legal claim for damages in a US-style class action and so receive automatic compensation if the case succeeds.A Â£14bn legal claim filed against Mastercardseeking damages for anti-competitive card fees is the first significant test of these new rules. Unclaimed payments are not always in the form of compensation. Billions of pounds in benefits is unclaimed every year by those entitled to the money. Up to Â£4.6bn of Housing Benefit went unclaimed in 2014-15, according to the latest figures from the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP). Families entitled to the benefit but not claiming it missed out on an average of Â£3,000 per year. Some 1.4 million households failing to receive Pension Credit are missing out on Â£2,000 a year, the figures show. Entitlements worth thousands of pounds a year were also going unclaimed for employment and support allowance (available to those who are unable to work owing to illness) and jobseekers' allowance. The DWP says that a lack of awareness of these entitlements and the ""perceived stigma"" of claiming benefits were thought to be among the reasons that people failed to make a claim. Some of these payouts will become automatic under the new Universal Credit benefit, which is being gradually introduced across the UK. Later in life, many people could miss out on retirement income, with millions of pension savings pots lying dormant. These are often small pots of savings from workplace pensions when employees spent a short period of time in jobs and have moved home since. All this amounts to billions of pounds available to claim - and claim legitimately - without the need for a lucky lottery win.

SportRangers 1-2 Celtic31 December 2016 (14:14:20),"Celtic came from behind to beat Old Firm rivals Rangers and move 19 points clear at the top of the Premiership. Kenny Miller slid in to convert James Tavernier's cross and put the home side ahead early on. Moussa Dembele's powerful shot from a Scott Sinclair corner flashed high into the net to bring Celtic level, and Dembele later fired against the bar. The visitors dominated the second half, and Sinclair touched home Stuart Armstrong's low cross for the winner. Mark Warburton's hosts showed from the outset their intention was to press their opponents in wide areas, and it paid dividends when Josh Windass released Tavernier to set up Miller's close-range finish. Celtic continued to concede too much space in the full-back areas, and further deliveries troubled goalkeeper Craig Gordon and his defence. However, Dembele's leveller put Celtic into the ascendancy and Rangers then struggled to get Barrie McKay and Tavernier on the ball, though McKay did draw a save from Gordon after the break. Having struggled to get a telling delivery at set-pieces, Rangers may have gone ahead just before Celtic's second as Danny Wilson met Tavernier's corner, Gordon making the save. Former Celtic striker Miller netted his 10th Old Firm goal Summer signings Dembele and Sinclair had run the Rangers defence ragged in September's 5-1 win at Celtic Park, and the duo's link-up play was again the catalyst as the visitors recovered from their early setback. Sinclair's set-piece was controlled and rattled into the top-right corner by Celtic's top scorer Dembele - a fifth goal against Rangers for the Frenchman this season. And he should have taken that tally to six after Mikael Lustig squared the ball to the striker early in the second period, a miskick allowing Wes Foderingham to save. Dembele could have added to his first-half strike Foderingham came to Rangers' rescue when James Forrest was played in on goal by Stuart Armstrong but Sinclair would ensure a happy end to 2016 for his team, applying the finish to Armstrong's piercing ball across the face of goal. Armstrong, Sinclair and substitute Nir Bitton forced further saves from Foderingham as Rangers continued to struggle in defence. In a match of so many chances, it was a surprise there were only three goals. Sinclair fired against the right-hand post as Celtic trailed, and Dembele's downward volley bounced up on to the crossbar at 1-1, with Sinclair firing the rebound wide. And, after Sinclair had netted, Rangers were also left frustrated by the goal frame as Miller's shot came back off the same post Sinclair had hit in the opening half. Miller came closest to an equaliser for Rangers The Scottish Premiership enters its winter break for the early part of January and Celtic can extend their advantage at the top to 22 points if they win their game in hand against St Johnstone near the end of next month. The league leaders, who have won 15 Premiership matches in a row and have only dropped two points all season, are targeting a sixth straight top-flight title win and a first under manager Brendan Rodgers. For Rangers, they suffer their first competitive home defeat since September 2015 and face a battle to hold on to second place with Aberdeen, who have a game in hand, two points behind them.

Gone from our airwaves,"In January, veteran broadcaster Sir Terry Wogan died at the age of 77 after a ""short but brave battle with cancer"". Sir Terry had a 50-year career on radio and television, including presenting Wake up to Wogan on BBC Radio 2, chat show Wogan and fronting the BBC's annual Children in Need appeal. He was the first of several well-known TV and radio figures we said goodbye to in 2016. Ronnie Corbett, best known for BBC comedy sketch show The Two Ronnies, died in March aged 85. The entertainer had had ben in ill health for some time and had been in hospital in 2014 with gall bladder problems. Magician Paul Daniels died in March aged 77, after being diagnosed with a brain tumour. He was at his Berkshire home with wife Debbie McGee when he died.

William Roache, who has played Ken Barlow since the first episode, said Warren would be ""so desperately missed"". Warren started the soap when he was 24. Cliff Michelmore, a familiar figure in BBC radio and TV broadcasting since the 1940s, died in March aged 96. He anchored coverage of events including the Apollo moon landings and two general elections, and interviewed figures including Prince Charles, Prime Minister Harold Wilson and a 17-year-old David Bowie. In April, Victoria Wood died peacefully at her north London home after a short illness. At the time, her regular co-star Julie Walters described the loss as ""incalculable"". Wood found fame in the 1980s and was best known for her BBC sketch Acorn Antiques and comedy Dinnerladies. In April, entertainer, producer and reality television star David Gest died in a London hotel at the age of 62. He was best known in the UK for his appearances on I'm A Celebrity...

'Unreasonable' men,"In a one-party state, principles for citizens often seem like a dangerous and expensive luxury The year 2016 has been another grim year for those campaigning for human rights in China. On freedom of speech, religious expression, trades unions and a host of other issues, China's one-party state continues to punish those who try to insist on their constitutional rights. Meanwhile, through propaganda and censorship it works hard to nurture an unquestioning herd mentality and to discourage any exploration of individual values. But even in this unpromising landscape, defiance takes root in unlikely corners. We were in the private dining room of a showy restaurant and the boss was already slurring his words. A large man with a level gaze, he'd finished one bottle of fine French wine and was moving on to a second. As he lit a cigarette, two glasses went over like nine pins, one splashing red wine across the table and the other smashing on to the floor. If influential people join the fight for legal rights - in between trips to London's casinos - then perhaps progress really is coming But he barely seemed to notice and went on telling me how he'd loved London's casinos when he stopped off on the way back from visiting his daughter's British boarding school. Imagine my surprise, then, when across the dishes stacked with roast duck and dumplings, this local Mr Big suddenly thrust at me a brown file full of well-thumbed papers. ""Fifteen years I've been fighting this miscarriage of justice,"" he declared. A handbrake turn from talk of boarding schools and casinos. He told me he'd got embroiled in a factional power battle. One local Communist Party boss wanted him to dish the dirt on a rival. Nine members of his family had been detained and interrogated and when he wouldn't sign statements incriminating the political target, he himself was jailed on charges of tax evasion. Even worse, a cousin had died mysteriously in police custody. By the time he'd got to the end of this grimly familiar story of crime and injustice, the second bottle of red wine was empty and we'd long run out of things to toast. Now I don't usually see it as my job to deliver unpalatable truths to provincial restaurant bosses. The private dining rooms of China have seen more coldblooded politics than I will ever conceive. But I had eaten his dinner and the least I could do in return was point out that he would not win his battle for justice and instead would waste a lot of money and a lot of political capital in the process of losing. ""I don't care about the money!"" he replied. ""The innocent must never give up on justice. I'll campaign for this wrong to be righted till the day I die."" Well that brought me up short. I'm not used to private citizens standing on principle in China, especially not rich people. After all, this is a huge, homogenising society under an authoritarian one-party state. George Bernard Shaw: Progress depends on the unreasonable man Principles often seem like a dangerous and expensive luxury. Yes, Communist Party leaders make speeches about principles, but for the public that's even more reason to regard such talk as arrant hypocrisy. I'd even go so far as to say that many Chinese people today are actively intolerant or suspicious of those who stand up for values. George Bernard Shaw may have written, ""the reasonable man adapts himself to the world: the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man"". But you don't hear people quoting that in China. Instead there are plenty of proverbs telling people to keep their heads down or they'll get them lopped off. George Bernard Shaw's unreasonable man is plain crazy in this worldview. Not someone heroic and brave, but a loser who will go down and probably take his family and friends with him. From Our Own Correspondent has insight and analysis from BBC journalists, correspondents and writers from around the world Listen on iPlayer, getthe podcastor listen on the BBC World Service or on Radio 4 on Thursdays at 11:00 BST and Saturdays at 11:30 BST It's not so surprising given that people with convictions are the enemy to a paranoid political class which regards alternative values as an existential challenge. But at this dining table I was now rethinking my assumptions about the people standing up to the system and shrugging off the crazy tag. I'd recently met a renegade bishopwho was defying both the Vatican and the Chinese Communist Party. The victims of China's 'War on Law' crackdown What happened to China's arrested rights lawyers? China rights lawyer Xia Lin jailed for 12 years And when I noted that many Roman Catholics were calling him crazy, he observed that people had called Jesus Christ crazy too. I'd observed brave human rights lawyers standing up for imprisoned colleagues. And young politicians in Hong Kong resisting Beijing's surreal version of democracy. But the story that made me stop and think was this one among the wine stains and the scallops sprinkled with cigarette ashâ¦ a well-fed restaurant boss with so much to lose from upsetting local party bosses determined to join the ranks of George Bernard Shaw's unreasonable men and women. If people like this join the fight for legal rights - in between their trips to London's casinos - then perhaps progress really is coming.

'I needed help',"Paul Scully-Sloan's son TJ inspired the online support group Daddys with Angels When toddler TJ Scully-Sloan died suddenly, his mum and siblings were offered support and a shoulder to cry on. But his dad was asked how he was feeling just once, by an undertaker. The experience led to him setting up a group to help fathers address a question no-one wants to have to answer - how do you cope after the death of a child? Friday 19 November 2010 was like any other night in the Scully-Sloan household. After a normal, busy, bedtime routine, TJ was tucked into bed by his mum, Helen. It was like any other night, except the little boy didn't wake up. Six years on, Paul Scully-Sloan, 49, still struggles with the words. ""At a quarter-past five the next morning, his two-year-old sister Miya-May was up shouting, running round, banging doors. His four year-old brother Calum was standing in the middle of the floor, like a rabbit in the headlights. ""Helen looked at TJ who wasn't moving with all this noise. She shouts for me and I can tell there's something wrong. ""I said 'give me your phone - take the kids downstairs - turn on the television, stand by the front door'. I picked TJ up from the bed, he's cold and he's blue, put him on the floor, started to try to resuscitate him and at the same time ringing the ambulance. Paul Scully-Sloan set up Daddys with Angels to support other fathers facing the loss of a child ""What seemed like forever, but it was like 20 minutes, a paramedic came in and told me there was nothing I could do."" TJ - whose full name was Travers James - had died in his sleep of natural causes. Tests found he'd had inflamed tonsils and a severe flu-like virus. In a period of indescribable grief, Mr Scully-Sloan felt alone. He ""didn't fit the criteria"" for many established child loss charities. His son was too old for Mr Scully-Sloan to benefit from the help of miscarriage or stillbirth organisations. He felt fathers needed somewhere to unload. In the front room of a house in Northampton, Daddys With Angels (DWA) was born. ""There wasn't a place for dads where they felt welcome,"" he said. ""There wasn't a place to say what they needed or what they wanted to say, to be honest about it, without the fear of being judged. There were groups for men - but run by women. ""You're supposed to be strong, to crack on with it. ""I had some understanding of child loss through my work, but not of the impact. Everything changes,"" he said. Paul Scully-Sloan's son TJ, who died in 2010 ""We talk about the 'new normal'. Waking up knowing your child is not there. But life is not going to go back to the way it was, things are going to change and you're going to view things differently."" Increasingly, bereaved fathers are turning to groups such as Mr Scully-Sloan's. The Lullaby Trust, which supports families after a sudden infant death, offers a befriending service to extended family members, which has seen great demand from dads. ""We have a policy here that we always ask about the other parent after a child's death, and our befriender scheme is well used by dads,"" said director of services, Jenny Ward. ""Different groups need different means to reach that support and the way people access it is changing all the time."" Mr Scully-Sloan, who is separated from TJ's mother, says the stress of losing a child can have a devastating effect on the family unit. ""In order to be good for your partner you need to be in a good place yourself. The biggest problem with child loss and couples is that they don't tell each other how they're feeling. They fear they'll upset them even more. What they really want to say is:  'I hurt too'. ""As soon as they can say that - it's almost like a relief. The other person in that relationship is feeling the same."" At the time of his son's death, Mr Scully-Sloan was also desperately ill with liver disease and awaiting a transplant. ""We had his funeral four days before Christmas,"" he said. Knitted cots have been donated from across the country ""People were coming to the door - people we hadn't seen for ages - bringing flowers and saying 'how's Helen?' - telling me I looked yellow. People were phoning up to speak to Helen, even when we were at the hospital, people were asking 'how's Helen, how's the kids?' ""The only person who asked me, between TJ dying and the funeral, was the undertaker. She looked after TJ so well, asking what I wanted him to wear - he had his ear pierced - she even managed to put his little earring back in for him. She did that for us - the little things. ""At the funeral I said I wanted to carry his coffin. It was cornflower blue. When I had to take it out of the hearse I couldn't pick it up - nobody said 'how are you - do you need any help?' - I had to put it down and admit I wasn't strong enough."" This, said Mr Scully-Sloan, is why he wants to help other bereaved dads. ""Fathers need to know someone has walked in their shoes,"" he said. ""I know what it's like to sit alone with the TV off and the lights off, just sitting there thinking. ""Men want to fix things; they can't fix child loss. The next best thing is to talk about it."" Daddys With Angels Knitted bootees donated to Daddys With Angels for stillborn babies Daddys With Angels now has almost 1,000 members, six trustees and four support workers, helping anyone who has lost a child at any age. Mr Scully-Sloan describes it as a ""safe place"" for fathers to ""rant or chat"" or get support and advice. DWA has twice won Best UK Support Organisation at the Butterfly Awards, which celebrates the work of parents and professionals at the front line of bereavement. The aim now is to establish a DWA helpline and set up group meetings around the country. An appeal for volunteers to knit cots, wraps and hats for still-born babies saw a big response and items now fill Mr Scully-Sloan's living room. He has already delivered dozens to bereavement midwives at the Liverpool Women's Hospital, his local unit at Northampton General and to funeral homes. Rachael Moss, a bereavement support midwife at Northampton General Hospital, said the little cots are a lifeline. ""The items brought in are so individual and so appreciated, you can see how much care and compassion has gone into making them - it's amazing. ""Families know they are not on their own. To know that there is someone else out there, another means of support, means everything.""

Dearly departed,"It's been held up as a particularly gloomy year for celebrity deaths. But has the grim reaper really claimed the souls of more notable people than usual in 2016? David Bowie, Prince, George Michael, Harper Lee, Alan Rickman, Nancy Reagan, Muhammad Ali, Sir George Martin, Victoria Wood, Leonard Cohenâ¦ For their admirers, 2016 has been a sad year. Back in April, the BBC's Obituaries Editor Nick Serpell was tasked with checking if there was anything unusual about the number of well-known people dying, as many on social media had been claiming. He counted the number of pre-prepared BBC obituaries that ran across radio, TV and online from January until the end of March for the years 2012-16. Andat that pointhe found that, yes, just looking at the first three months of the year, there had been a huge increase. Twice as many notable people had died in this period of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015, and five times as many as in 2012. It's worth bearing in mind that this is quite a crude way of measuring celebrity deaths. The BBC doesn't do an obituary for every celebrity that dies and, as already noted, Serpell only counted pre-prepared obituaries, rather than obituaries written after the event, or news reports that mention someone has died. Then there's also the question of who even counts as a celebrity in the first place. US television personality David Gest, for example, did not get a BBC obituary. Nonetheless, as the year draws to a close, it seems an appropriate time to ask - has 2016 continued to be so dangerous and fateful for famous people? Across the whole year, there was just over a 50% increase in BBC pre-prepared obituaries used in 2016 compared with 2015. ""In 2012, we had a total of 16,"" says Serpell. ""In 2013, it went to 24. In 2014, it rose again to 29. In 2015, it rose slightly again to 32."" For 2016, as of 30 December, it stands at 49. ""Just under half those deaths occurred in the first three  months of the year,"" says Serpell. The rest of the year looked like it was settling back down to be on a par with 2015. However, there was yet another spike of notable deaths over the Christmas period when seven more people died within a two-week period. More or Lessis broadcast on BBC Radio 4 and the World Service Download the More or Lesspodcast More storiesfrom More or Less So 2016 has seen the largest number of famous people die, but it was those bumps at the beginning and the end of the year that made it so unusual. Although there does seem to have been an inexorable rise, Serpell says there hasn't been any change in the BBC's policy on what sort of person qualifies for an obituary.

Mum's bracelet,"While travelling through Kyrgyzstan, Eloise Dicker lost her late mother's treasured gold bracelet. Then a Facebook message changed everything. It was on the second day of our five-day trek that I realised it was missing. We had packed up the tents and loaded the horses. I reached up to the horse's mane to pull myself up and saw that my wrist was bare. ""My mum's bracelet! It's gone,"" I thought, and immediately burst into tears. Find us on Facebook,external Made from melted-down rings she inherited from her own mother, the bracelet had always been worn by my mum for almost as long as I could remember. Eloise Dicker's wrist with and without the bracelet Her wrist was very slender even towards the end of her life, with steroids puffing her up like a blowfish. There came a point, however, when she couldn't wear it any more. She had taken it off and placed it on her bedside table. While clearing up the cups and tissues, tablets and tinctures, I had picked the bracelet up and put it on. She'd smiled, put her hand on my wrist and said how lovely it was to see me wearing it and that one day I would pass it on to my children. She died a couple of months later, and I had never taken the bracelet off. Rosemary Dicker, wearing the bracelet six months before her death on Mother's Day 2015 Now I felt pain in my throat and a sinking feeling in my stomach. It could be anywhere in this vast landscape - the Tian Shan mountains of Kyrgyzstan, Central Asia. There was a silence as we all realised there was no point in even trying to find it. We were two days up into the mountains and surrounded by grass. I had one last look around our camp. It was no use. I couldn't re-trace my steps, we were in the middle of nowhere. I climbed back on the horse. I walked behind the others, crying and thinking. All the memories of her passing away came back to me, bit by bit. Rosemary holding Eloise's brother Barnaby in the early 1980s My naked wrist still made me feel incomplete. I wanted to go back in time to the moment I decided to bring it with me. Why hadn't I left it at home? But maybe it was meant to be here, I thought to myself. Mum was born in Hong Kong and grew up in the UK, and this was half way. An endless lush landscape with wild horses, snowy peaks, birds of prey and the sound of the river. Maybe it should be lost here. That night I looked in the tents with a bit of hope left that it might be in some corner. Nothing. I crawled into my sleeping bag feeling deeply sad, and accepted it was gone for good. Later, in the city of Karakol, recovering from our trek, I visited the Russian Orthodox church. I was just about to leave, having lit a candle in remembrance of my mother, when the Russian nun took my arm and walked me to a painting of the Virgin Mary. She kissed the glass frame of the picture and gestured that I do the same. I'm not a believer, and was not brought up religious in any way, but I followed her invitation. When I kissed the glass I looked up at the picture. I started crying. The picture was adorned with gold necklaces and rings. It was feeling just how jewellery was so significant to humans that made me cry. As a student of anthropology, I have always been interested in the meaning we humans ascribe to objects. Jewellery by its very nature says:Look at me, see what I can afford, observe what I was given, admire how significant I am. When inherited from a beloved, it also brings people into relationship, solidifying a kinship or affection, creating a sense of connectedness and of presence. That bracelet was a physical part of my mother who is no longer physically in the world. It became part of me, and now was gone. I had already made peace with the loss of the bracelet when, some weeks after I had returned to Europe, I received a Facebook message from Elaman Asanbaev, one of the guides from the Community-Based Tourism (CBT) office in Karakol. There was a picture attached. ""This is it or not, I don't know,"" he asked. It was it. It was the bracelet. It was suddenly back in existence, but what should I do? Should I get Elaman to send it? Should I leave it there? Ask him to throw it in the river? When I looked into secure courier services, they advised against sending precious stones or metals. I was also reluctant to trust the postal system, it being so far away. It did occur to me that I could find someone who would be travelling there, but when I saw that flights were cheap in November I decided I would go and get it myself. London-Moscow-Bishkek. Then a six-hour drive from the capital Bishkek to Karakol with Azamat Asanov, the CBT manager. It was 05:00 and -11C in the capital, the roads icy with thick snow. As we drove, I watched the country waking up. Children in their winter clothes walking to school, horses with snow on their backs, men in the traditional pointed Kyrgyz hats known as kalpaks. The next morning we picked up Elaman. ""This is for you,"" he said as he jumped in the car. There it was. This slim piece of gold that I have known all my life. This part of mum, here in this car 7,000km (4,350 miles) from home in the freezing mountains of Kyrgyzstan. Elaman described to Azamat where he found it. I didn't understand anything except a word that sounded like ""toilet"". Azamat translated - it was in our first campsite, a yurt camp, lying on a path towards the toilets (or, more accurately, a shed with a hole in the ground). We laughed. Not the most romantic of places. I felt its weight and its shape. Mum held this. Putting it back on I felt complete again, and I couldn't stop looking at it. I gave Elaman a designer flask and wrapped some money around it as a reward for handing in the bracelet. There was another day in the snow on horseback before I turned round and made the long 21-hour journey back home. We took the horses up the Bos Uchuk valley, which means ""colourful point"". This was where we had camped on our last day of the summer trek. I could recognise the shape of the mountains and the river. On my way back to the town I sprinkled some of mum's ashes in the river - something to exchange for the bracelet in the ground, something to put her between home and where she was born, Hong Kong. At this point I felt that these rituals were almost too much. Yet back home, looking at photographs of mum, I notice the bracelet in every picture. I think how strange it is to know that it had a story waiting of being lost and found far away in a wonderful place. Is this still the most precious thing that I own? Yes. Would I take it again on an adventure? Probably. Join the conversation - find us onFacebook,external,Instagram,external,Snapchat,externalandTwitter,external.

Monkey business,"RIP Harambe His was the face which launched a thousand memes - so why did Harambe the gorilla capture 2016's collective online psyche? It was a sad story that could have been even sadder. In May, a three-year-old child fell into an enclosure at Cincinnati Zoo. One of the Western lowland gorillas inside started dragging the boy around. ""Mommy's right here! Mommy loves you!"" the boy's mother shouted, as bystanders became increasingly panicked. Finally, fearing that the boy's life was in danger, a zoo worker killed Harambe with a single shot. The boy escaped without serious injury. The events were capturedon a YouTube video,externalwhich has been watched millions of times. Harambe's deathtouched off a heated - if predictable - debateabout zoo welfare standards and whether lethal force was necessary. But what wasn't expected was what came next. Harambe became memeified. His image was spread far and wide throughout the internet. He became the subject of serious and unserious campaigns. And he was evenmemorialised in song,external. Join the conversation on this and other storieshere,external. It started as a spontaneous and very real outpouring of shock and grief over the killing. ""Had I been there, I would have gone into the enclosure myself,"" says Frank Paris, one of the people who used the hashtag #RIPHarambe to express his sadness. It quickly began to spread hours after the gorilla's death. Although he lived a few states away in Los Angeles, Paris, along with many others, was upset at Cincinnati Zoo's decision to kill the animal. ""That day was a very sad day for me,"" he tells BBC Trending. ""I absolutely would have risked my own life to save the boy. That's how sure I am that the boy was fine and that Harambe had no intention of hurting anybody."" Of course, that's just one reaction from someone thousands of miles away, whereas zoo officials say they were right to take action to stop any potential serious injury to the boy. But Paris was not alone in his grief and anger. Aside from his canonisation on social media, there were candlelit vigils for Harambe. There were also campaigns targeted the boy's parents. Some online called for them to be prosecuted for negligence. The boy's mother was cleared of any wrongdoing. ""There was definitely a sincere element of outrage over this,"" says Aja Romano, who writes about web culture for news site Vox. ""It just spiralled out of control and was immediately a giant social trend, because it involved an element of supposed animal cruelty. You could argue that by keeping Harambe in the zoo to begin with, the zoo was fostering this unfair environment where the gorilla didn't really have a chance."" That wave of emotion was in turn hijacked by comedians, pranksters and trolls who mocked those who were making so much of the story. ""People online kind of get off on being mad about things that they don't actually care about,"" says Brandon Wardell, a stand-up comedian and one of those who poked fun at the Harambe mourners. ""You didn't know Harambe, your life wasn't really affected by this."" Wardell coined a jokey phrase that - to put it one way - sarcastically encouraged people to expose themselves in tribute to the dead gorilla. ""I think I was probably drunk when I tweeted it and then it just got out of control,"" he tells Trending. It got him branded the ""voice of a generation"" by Rolling Stone magazine. Then things took a dark turn when the memes were picked up by the alt-right,an amorphous but internet savvy white nationalist movement. The gorilla's image was used in racist messages. ""I feel like it was driven to the ground so quickly,"" Wardell recalls. ""It stopped being funny to me two days after. ""I didn't love that there were Nazis that were all of a sudden into a meme that I created."" But the Harambe phenomenon was also too large to be totally owned by one fringe group. The Cincinnati zoodeclared itself unimpressedwith all the riffs on its dead animal - but that certainly didn't put an end to the jokes. Memes comparing Harambe to David Bowie, Prince and Muhammad Ali have since gone viral. He's been the subject of fake news stories, books, comics - and a parody of the Book of Genesis. Hear more on this story and otherson the BBC World Service. ""If you were really tired of seeing media hysteria dominate news cycles and dominate conversations, the sheer absurdity of Harambe as a social issue was a really easy thing to mock,"" says Romano, the Vox writer. ""I think it spoke to a level of outrage fatigue. If you're seeing people freaking out about a dead gorilla, over say thousands of people dying in the Syrian refugee crisis, then what do you do with that anger? ""The only way to sort of express your anger was to just turn this sort of worship of Harambe and turn this deep cultural grief over Harambe's death into a meme."" Indeed, not just any meme, butthememe of 2016. RIP Harambe. You can follow BBC Trending on Twitter@BBCtrending,external, and find us onFacebook,external.  All our stories are atbbc.com/trending.

Smooth operators,"Waxing pubic hair has become increasingly common, but how did the trend for the ""Brazilian"" wax begin? In an office toilet in London, young women discuss their grooming regimes. Jennifer, 19, waxes off all her pubic hair every month. ""The pain is the worst thing I've ever been through, but I'm kind of used to it now,"" she says. ""I prefer the underneath being gone,"" says Lisa, 27. ""Some people wax for the beach and other people wax for boys, and people who wax for boys wax the underneath."" Ever since Sex and the City tackled the subject, what women do with their pubic hair - trim, shave, pluck, wax or let it all hang out - has become a topic for discussion. And scientific research. Studies show that pubic hair grooming is becoming increasingly common. Earlier this yearresearchers reported in JAMA Dermatology,externalthat 84% of the American women who took part in their survey had done some grooming, with 62% removing all of their pubic hair. Younger women were much more likely to groom than the over-40s. An earlierstudy in the Journal of Sexual Medicine,externallinked the phenomenon to the availability of pornography. This same study suggested that the trend originated in South America - ""hence the term Brazilian as slang for complete pubic hair removal"". But that is not the whole story. ""The Brazilian bikini wax was born here in New York, not Brazil,"" says Jonice Padilha, of the J Sisters salon in Manhattan, which pioneered the treatment in the early 1990s. A Brazilian wax involves removing all the pubic hair from underneath and leaving some hair at the front for decorative purposes - perhaps a triangle, a thin ""landing strip"" or a heart-shape, that's up to the customer. ""It's a freedom for you to have whatever you want,"" she says. Jonice is the youngest of seven Brazilian sisters whose names all begin with J - the others are Jocely, Janea, Joyce, Juracy, Jussara and Judseia. They became known collectively as the J Sisters because nobody could get all the names right. Today the salon is popular with the rich and famous, and they make up to $6m a year on waxing, hair and nail treatments. But it had humble beginnings. ""It's an inspirational story of self-made women who came from nothing, illegal immigrants who made it in America,"" says Laura Malin, author of Wax and the City, a forthcoming book about the J Sisters. ""It's the American dream."" Find us on Facebook,external The sisters come from the small coastal town of Vitoria, which lies between Rio and Bahia. They grew up in a large family - seven sisters and seven brothers - and in a traditional, macho culture. Their father forbade them from going out unchaperoned, and was afraid it wasn't safe for them to work for other people, Jocely says. But when he went bankrupt, his daughters began to bring in money by offering beauty treatments in their back yard.  Eventually they became the main breadwinners, and ran three salons in the town. ""After school I used to hang out in the salon, instead of going to friends' houses,"" says Jonice. In such a traditional household, it seemed that the only way to leave home was to get married, but Jocely, the fourth sister, dreamed of seeing the world. She saved up and in 1982 went to New York to visit an old neighbour from Vitoria. She planned to stay for a month, but the few hundred dollars she had brought ran out in a matter of days. She faced a choice: fly home or start earning. She could have been in trouble. ""New York was a lot more violent then and many Brazilian women were prostitutes, so there was this prejudice,"" says Malin. Luckily, Jocely had skills.

Listen toThe Why factor: Female body hair Why do we have armpit hair and pubic hair? Listen toThe Curious Cases of Rutherford & Fry: Hair She spoke no English, but found a job at a nail salon run by a Portuguese woman. At the time the fashion was for stick-on acrylic nails which would be removed weeks later, leaving quite a bit of damage. Jocely's focus was on restoring the nail's natural health and lustre. Her reputation for manicures spread and she attracted a powerful customer - Adnan Khashoggi. The arms-trade magnate would book her for the entire day, at a rate of $100 an hour, so he could have manicures between meetings. Through him she met many influential people, from stars such as Brooke Shields and Rod Stewart to the editors of fashion magazines like Elle and Marie Claire. Soon she was earning well and, one by one, her sisters came over to join her. Jonice was the second to come to New York. She was dazzled. ""It was when I arrived here that I realised Brazil was Third World,"" she says. ""We knew nothing."" In 1987 the sisters opened their first nail salon on 57th St between 5th and 6th Avenue, then considered a fairly undesirable location. People thought they were crazy, says Jonice. At the time you didn't need a licence to run a nail salon so it was the obvious place to start, but they had other beauty secrets to impart. A few years later, at the start of the '90s, they began offering their - as yet unnamed - extreme bikini wax. It removed all pubic hair from below, not just at the sides. Their signature wax had been invented by their sister Janea. ""It's a funny story actually,"" says Malin. Back in the late '70s Janea was in Bahia with her husband, having a beer and some fried fish on the beach. She was admiring a beautiful girl, but as she walked past Janea was horrified by the pubic hair protruding from the back of her tiny bikini. ""The image - it was like a mirror that shattered,"" says Malin. Janea's next thought was: ""Wow, do we have hair there?"" At home her suspicion was confirmed. But when she went to a salon to have it removed, she met with resistance: ""Are you crazy? I'm not touching you there,"" was the response. So Janea decided to do it herself.  She locked herself in the waxing booth with a mirror and after about three hours of painful experimentation came out feeling fabulous. Then she convinced her co-workers to do the same. ""They were like: 'Oh my god I don't feel ashamed when I'm in bed with men, I don't feel shame when I go to the doctor, I feel cleaner,'"" explains Malin. When they introduced it in New York, their bikini wax became wildly popular. It helped that they still counted the editors of fashion magazines among their customers. ""Our only error was not to call it the J Sisters wax,"" says Jonice. But there was a problem - they were coming under pressure from rivals. The early '90s had seen a boom in online porn, which increasingly featured hairless actors and models. ""It's very practical for pornography but it's just very practical for sex,"" adult film-maker Anna Spantold the BBC.  Adultmagazines such as Playboy and Penthouse,externalalso showed little or no pubic hair. Jonice says Playboy called the salon, claiming they had come up with the idea first. ""They said: 'This is ours, we do this for the porno site,'"" she says. Jonice's defence was to say that it was just what everyone in Brazil did. ""I said we were introducing our culture,"" she says. ""That's why all over the world it's known as a Brazilian. I played it that way so they would leave me alone. But it started here, not there."" People haven't forgotten that the J Sisters were the real pioneers. They were consulted for shows like Gossip Girl and Sex And the City. ""Sarah Jessica Parker came here all the time,"" says Jocely. They count many celebrities as close friends. ""They have very intimate relationships with people,"" says Malin. ""If you spread your legs to a woman then you don't have anything else to hide. I've been there so many times and you end up talking about everything: depression, kids, anal sex... It's crazy and a little bit therapeutic."" As well as Malin's book, a biopic about the sisters is in production in Brazil - a ""dramedy"", or comic drama, say the producers. ""They were very brave to leave this small town in Brazil and go to New York with no money and no English,"" says Karen Castanho, one of the producers. ""They have such energy, I've never met anyone like them."" Female body hair is a recurring theme in the work of French street artist Sandrine Boulet So what does the future hold for the Brazilian wax? The trend could be on its way out. A recent study has linked pubic grooming toan increase in sexually transmitted infections. The GB cycling teambanned bikini waxesduring the Olympics because the hair protects against chafing. EvenTatler magazine recently announced,externalthe return of the natural look. Back in the London office toilet this, too, has been noticed. ""Boys are saying: 'Don't do it, if you shave it all off you look like a baby,"" says Alex, 23. Her friend Cameron, 21, agrees. ""Yes, my friends say they like bush because they feel more mature being with that person."" But the J Sisters always move with the times. For the past 10 years they've been waxing men. And since Jocely discovered her first grey hair down there, the salon can also dye pubic hair, to prevent the kind of home-dying mishaps featured in Sex and the City. One thing's for sure, thanks to their influence this part of the body will never again be neglected. Some names have been changed.

Art of peace,"During a congress for world peace in Paris in 1949, Pablo Picasso was asked to design an emblem to signify peace. He chose the dove - inspired possibly by the caged birds he kept in his Paris studio. The symbol caught on instantaneously. This letter made of gold leaf was sent from King Rama IV of Siam (modern-day Thailand) to Emperor Napoleon III in 1861. The choice of medium was seen as a sign that King Rama recognised the superior power of France, which had recently obliged Siam to open its doors to trade. The letter was received by Napoleon at an elaborate ceremony at Fontainebleau. The jumble of discs consists of 120 seals appended by the loftiest members of the Polish nobility. In May 1573 they met at Kamien near Warsaw to choose who should be their king. The French ambassador lobbied for Henri de Valois, third son of that arch-conniver Catherine de Medici. His persuasion worked - this document formally confirms Henriâs election. But he was king of Poland for only two years, and in 1575 was crowned king of France. This painting by Adolphe Roehn captures the moment in 1807 when Napoleon met for peace talks with the Russian Tsar Alexander I on a raft anchored at Tilsit on the river Neman (in modern-day Russian Kaliningrad). Napoleon had beaten the Russians at the battle of Friedland, and the Treaty of Tilsit created an alliance between the two countries that humbled Prussia. The friendship did not last. Five years later Napoleon launched his disastrous invasion of Russia. This painting depicts no actual event. It is an allegory devised by the primitivist artist Henri Rousseau in 1907 - a time when dreams of world peace were gaining traction. The group of gentlemen in black are six French presidents. To their left are 10 foreign leaders, including Edward VII in the blue sash. On the right, peoples of the world dance around a statue of a left-wing hero that once stood in central Paris, but was pulled down in 1942. Officially this document is a memorandum of understanding between France and the UK over fishing rights in Newfoundland, some islands off Guinea, and zones of influence in Madagascar and Egypt. In fact, it is the physical embodiment of the entente cordiale - the friendly compact agreed in 1904 between the two countries that lasted through two world wars and down to this day. The silver case contains the seal of King Edward VII. Peacemakers are often war-makers who have had enough. Louis XIV made a lot of war, but he also made a lot of peace. Here the young king is represented being crowned by Glory after signing the Treaty of Nijmegen in 1679. This brought to an end the Franco-Dutch war, and created the northern French border as we know it today. The painting - by Antoine Coypel - depicts Europe in the middle-ground accompanied by Peace and Security. Sometimes third-country ambassadors were given powers to negotiate between warring parties. Here Holy Roman Emperor Charles VI grants to the Marquis of Villeneuve, French ambassador to Constantinople, the right to represent him in talks to end war with the Ottoman Empire. The following year, 1739, the Treaty of Belgrade was signed. The document contains a glaring error: the name of the Sultan should be Mahmud I not Ahmed III! The Capitulations were privileges granted by Ottoman emperors to European residents. In 1673, after months of negotiations, Sultan Mehmed IV agreed to renew privileges to French citizens. This gloriously composed document was sent to Louis XIV. The central figure is the tugra or signature of the Ottoman sovereign. This handsome portfolio contains the ratification by Peru in 1861 of a friendship treaty with France. The cover is decorated with filigree of nickel alloy, with representations of bees. These may have been meant to flatter Napoleon III, who used the bee as an imperial emblem. At the time Peru was currying favour with the European powers - it had yet to be officially recognised by its former master Spain. Among the many treasures from the archives is the 1648 Treaty of Westphalia, which brought to an end the suffering of Europeâs Thirty Years War. It followed a multilateral congress of most of the major European powers - setting a pattern that was followed again and again in subsequent centuries. Under the treaty France won a large chunk of territory in the north-east. The originals of all the European treaties are here, including Maastricht (1992). The text - in 10 languages â is about one foot (30 cm) in height. Here we can see the signature of French Prime Minister Pierre Beregovoy, who committed suicide a year later. The last treaty in the exhibition is the Paris COP21 accord on climate change, signed this year.

'Obama liked my album',"Jack Garratt's debut album recently went silver, denoting 60,000 sales in the UK Jack Garratt topped the BBC's Sound of 2016 list in January and went on to score a top three album with his debut record, Phase. Since then, he's won a Brit Award, sold out the Hammersmith Apollo and proposed to his girlfriend, Sarah Elabdi. Hailing from Little Chalfont in Buckinghamshire, Garratt has come a long way since 2005, when he entered the British heats for the Junior Eurovision Song Contest and placed eighth - out of eight. Forced to rethink his approach, he conjured up a musical style that takes sentimental singer-songwriter material and smashes a box-full of electronics right over its head. It won him a deal with Island Records, while his athletic one-man shows have packed out concert halls around the world. Ahead of the announcement of theSound of 2017next week, Garratt reflects on the highs and lows of his first year in the spotlight. The star played almost 150 shows in 2016 I found out a few days before it was announced, but that doesn't mean I believed it. It means I was told those words and my ears conveyed those words to my brain. I didn't know in my heart it was real until the announcement happened. I didn't like flying. It's not so much the fear of heights as it is the fear of losing control - but I ended up taking a course that British Airways offer and have not been on a plane since where I have been terrified like I was before. They do equal parts sitting down with a pilot and understanding what flying is; and sitting down with a therapist and talking about what fears are. So you get your insecurities challenged from both angles. You get told about the reasons why you shouldn't be scared, then the therapist says, ""Your fear is natural, your fear is normal, and it's expected. Here's a way to help change your attitude."" I would 100% recommend to anyone who is insecure about flying. I cannot understand why that has not become a global phenomenon. Every visit was perfect and comfortable. I'd bring my own with me everywhere if (a) I could  afford to and (b) I could put up with the scrutiny and embarrassment. The musician entered the Junior Eurovision Song Contest as a teenager, but failed to qualify I could not be prouder or happier with the placement of that record. To come third behind Adele and David Bowie, I think that's fine. To have made a record that sounds like the one I made - which is challenging pop music about death and love - I could not have expected it to have done any better. The album's just gone silver, which is unbelievable. But a lot of people - not people whose opinions I care about, but unfortunately people whose opinions I'm exposed to - said that because the record hasn't sold hundreds of thousands of copies it's a failure. The music I'm making appeals to an audience that doesn't buy records. That would be like trying to sell meat to a vegetarian and then complaining that it doesn't sell well. This video can not be played Highlights from Jack Garratt's Glastonbury set, on 24 June 2016 It was very strange. I'm not going to say everyone was over the moon. But if you compared the atmosphere on Friday morning to that evening, it was like being at two different festivals. In the morning, everyone was like, ""Oh God, what are we going to do?"" But by the evening we were saying, ""Mate, we can keep doing what we've always done."" While obviously being aware there are huge consequences to come, we realised that music and art will prevail over everything. That was a huge moment. Craig David, without a doubt, one of the most inspirational people I've ever met. He taught me a lot about how you should be with strangers in this industry. When you met him, he gives you his full attention and it doesn't feel forced or fake. That is a rare thing. The singer's fiancee Sarah Elabdi is a marketing and advertising executive in Chicago I moved to Chicago recently, but I'm rarely at home. Then in July, I played Lollapalooza in Chicago for the first time - and I asked my girlfriend to become my fiancee and she said yes! It was really lovely to be able to do something as special and as life-changing as that in my own living room. Rock never dies, man! No, I'm kidding... Every guitarist I've ever loved and admired, I've seen a video of them going through something where it seems impossible they'll bound back, and every time they do because, ultimately, the moment is way more important than, ""My strings have broken,"" or, ""My foot's been bitten off by a dog."" I mean, that hasn't happened yet - but I'm planning to do a show this month at a puppy adoption agency so we'll see what happens. I sent President Obama a copy of my vinyl and didn't expect to hear anything about it - but, lo and behold, about three months later,a letter came through the post,externalfrom the Oval Office and it was signed by him, which was incredible. Will I send a copy of my next album to Donald Trump? Um, maybe not. We'll see what the lyrics are going to be about first. I'm not sure if he's going to appreciate it. The musician won best breakthrough act at November's Q Awards I know there are people who didn't go to the awards because they disagreed with the sponsor, and I admire that, but I think the best thing to do was exactly what happened: Three young artists, who have all been affected by secondary ticketing sites - myself, James Bay and Bastille - allsaid something about the fact secondary ticketing is not ethically or morally right. We fight really hard to make sure our tickets are affordable, because we want everyone to come to our shows. But when you hear about some millionaire out in Quebec who buys thousands and thousands of tickets before anyone else, and then resells them at a profit, that's not right. It's making a business out of stealing moments away from people. I don't agree with that and will do everything I can to expose those kinds of people as immoral and unethical. Being given an award by Mel C, then handing an award over to U2 and then sitting on a train to my mum and dad's and eating a pasty - I don't know about you, but that screams a perfect night to me. Jack Garratt is managed by the company that launched the careers of previous Sound Of... winners Ellie Goulding and Jessie J The music I'm making at the moment is very different from anything I've ever done. There's a lot of stuff I can't quite openly talk about yet, which is really fun and very exciting, but I'm going to go and disappear for a few months now. Well, I don't think I got the crown. No-one gave it to me. I absolutely 100% do not believe there was a crown in the first place. I think this year's list is incredibly diverse and they are all artists that I love. 2017 is going to be such an incredible year for art, especially given how awful 2016 has been for politics. We've all got a lot to write about and I think we're going to write some incredible stuff. Follow us onFacebook,external, on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external, or on Instagram atbbcnewsents,external.

Paul Moss: 2016: The year of anger,"Brazil President Dilma Rousseff was among several leaders to face fury from their public Does one emotion above all hold the key to understanding a year of tumultuous political change? I got it from both sides: eardrum-denting yells of fury, which managed to break through the noise of surrounding protestors. This was April in Brazil, with the country's President Dilma Rousseff facing what would eventually be a successful attempt to impeach her. Both opponents and defenders had taken to the streets. ""Go Dilma, go! Never moreâ¦ NE-VER Mooooooore!"" screamed one man. Just in case you might miss the fervour of his opinion, two fellow protestors marched, bearing a coffin with the president's name on it. Yet only a short distance away I found supporters of Dilma Rousseff roused to equal passion. One screwed his face up tight, as if mustering all the wrath of which he was capable, and then detonated it in a blast of fury which at one point threatened to overwhelm the limits of my microphone. ""Dilma cares for the poor. Every time a movement for the poor gets going, then comes a coup d'etatâ¦ violence is their game. We need radical resistance!"" Many of Donald Trump's supporters were keen to show their dislike of Hillary Clinton It was just one scene from 2016, a year defined by the unexpected, the unpredicted and unprecedented. Yet it was also a year in which one emotion was cited as the driving force behind these developments. ""There is great anger out there,"" Donald Trump told a rally, in what paradoxically was one of his calmer campaign speeches. ""Believe me there is great anger."" He might perhaps have been looking at his own supporters, who wore anti-Hillary T-shirts with slogans like ""Trump that Bitch"". Who are Donald Trump's loyal supporters? Italy referendum: Matteo Renzi resigns 'with lump in throat' What does the slogan 'Black Lives Matter' mean now? Brexit: All you need to know about the UK leaving the EU Mr Trump was speaking of a subject which he knows first-hand, being an enthusiastic sender of angry nocturnal tweets. Indeed, both supporters and detractors see Donald Trump's victory as a tribute to his knack for understanding people's discontent, then channelling it. ""Trump gave anger the green light,"" argues Arlie Hochshild, a sociologist based at the University of California. She believes many of his supporters were fired up by resentment at a globalised economy which seemed to have passed them by, their wages stagnant, the promise of the American dream unfulfilled. ""Trump,"" she says, ""gave permission for them to express what they had been storing."" Sometimes the very language of politics seemed to betray the aggressive emotions beneath. When Britain voted to leave the European Union in June, this was described as ""giving the establishment a bloody nose"" or ""a slap in the face for Europe's elites"" . Beppe Grillo led the successful No campaign in Italy's referendum on constitutional change These political slaps were not just a Western phenomenon. In South Africa and South Korea, in Hong Kong and Venezuela, angry crowds gathered to protest in 2016, not against a particular government, but against the very system by which they ruled. Perhaps the prevailing mood was best summed up by the Italian comedian-turned-politician, Beppe Grillo, who successfully campaigned for his country to vote No in a referendum on constitutional change. ""No,"" Mr Grillo said, was the most beautiful thing to say in politics these days, adding an obscenity directed at anyone who disagreed with him. If anger generated political upsets in 2016, then, according to the psychologist, Oliver James, anger was also an understandable response from those on the losing side, like EU Remain campaigners in Britain. Their defeat in a referendum, he suggests, was experienced like bereavement. ""We go through a cycle of sadness, despair, but then at other times are swamped by very powerful anger,"" James explains. I saw that sequence at work in Dallas this year, after five police officers were shot dead by an African-American army veteran. At a makeshift shrine, local residents expressed their shock, but many were also furious that this could happen, that the very people tasked with protecting them could prove so vulnerable. Five police officers were shot dead by an African-American army veteran in Dallas in July 2016 Yet the most pessimistic assessment came from a fellow African-American, who told me that while he could never condone the killing, he certainly understood it. ""Black people are tired of the way police officers treat us,"" he explained. ""I don't think it's going to calm down. I think the fire is already lit for retaliation."" That cycle of violence, the perpetuation of anger: this is what the writer Sam Leith fears will be the legacy of 2016. We are abandoning, he believes, the Greek ideal of logos (or reason) and ceding ground to the more irrational potential of pathos, expressed for now as anger. ""Anger seeks an object,"" he argues, ""it's very Newtonian. There's action and reaction, a divisive process which continues to accelerate divisionsâ¦ some sort of slow-motion catastrophe is what's required to press reset."" Yet this presumes that a reset is being sought in 2017, whereas the political changes unleashed this past year were welcomed by many as merely the beginning. Nigel Farage, one of the key campaigners for Brexit, offered a pertinent prediction. ""For those of you who aren't particularly happy with what happened in 2016, I've got some really bad news for you - it's going to get a bloody sight worse.""

"Karen Allen: Out of Africa, after 12 years","As she moves on from her posting, the BBC's Southern Africa correspondent Karen Allen looks back on nearly 12 years of reporting from the continent. Africa is not a country. It is a continent that feels like it has come of age. Despite the very real problems of poverty, corruption and the sense you sometimes get in some quarters, that no-one is held to account, business types hail Africa as the ""final frontier"". After nearly 12 years reporting this region, for me it feels like a place where one grows up. I have met priests and politicians, warlords and entrepreneurs, gangsters and teachers. Ordinary mums and dads. Each of them has helped to shape my impressions and many have become firm friends. One of the first lessons I learnt in Kenya was survival. There is no safety net here when times get tough. In the early days on a visit to the slum known as Kibera, an elderly lady called me over as she stirred her supper in a thick, black, cast-iron pot. ""Hey sister, where are you from?"" she asked. ""London,"" I replied. ""Yes, but where in London?"" I was rather puzzled as she pressed me further. ""I know London,"" she nodded, sagely. ""In fact, I know Paris and Berlin, too."" It emerged that this friendly stranger had once been a glamorous stewardess for an international airline. She had drunk the best champagne and visited the fanciest European hotels but when times got hard in the 1980s and the airline folded, she lost her job. South Sudan became Africa's 54th state on 9 July 2011 She was now selling samosas in the slum to survive. From that day onwards I learnt never to make any assumptions about Africa: a jet-setter one day, a slum dweller the next. It is the drumbeat of so many who take the knocks, but reclaim their dignity and survive. Yet, in absolute terms, people are getting poorer in Africa because the population continues to grow. During my time on this continent I witnessed a colleague of mine - away from the BBC - lose two of his three young children. That is never OK. Has South African reconciliation worked? Can Chinese migrants integrate in Africa? African countries create force to fight together Why does South Sudan matter so much to the US? When I arrived in Africa more than a decade ago, Boko Haram in Nigeria did not exist, Somalia's al-Shabab insurgency group had yet to be formed -  not to mention so-called Islamic State - and Sudan was one vast, sprawling country emerging from more than two decades of civil war. I arrived to a continent of 53 states. I now leave behind 54. South Sudan's independence in 2011 marked the newest addition to the globe. The birth pains are still being felt. When I arrived, George W Bush was beginning his second term as US president, oil and gas had yet to be discovered in many parts of Africa and mobile phones were just beginning to open up a world of possibilities from e-commerce to telemedicine. Mobile phones have transformed the lives of millions of Africans Now, two US presidents later (give or take a week or two), China has become the second-biggest investor in Africa, with India hard on its heels. The brain-drain is beginning to slow down as African talent is being retained, especially in the technology sector. And there is more money flowing back into Africa from remittances, than the entire aid budget for the continent. With this growing economic confidence, powered by a rising middle class, has come a new political assertiveness. And, with growing insecurity, the West knows it needs Africa more than ever before. You see it in the UN Security Council. South Africa has held its ground on issues such as Libya during the fall of  Gaddafi. The African Union is pushing for permanent seats and a greater say in world affairs as the continent now contributes more troops to peacekeeping operations than anywhere else on earth. You see this assertiveness in matters of international justice. Countries like South Africa and Burundi have turned their backs on the International Criminal Court. And you see this push back on matters of wider society and the tussle between the old way of doing things and what some see as imported Western ideas. Gay rights remain a controversial subject in many parts of the continent A rapidly growing young urban class, more connected with the world through mobile phones, is making new demands, touching on everything from gender equality to gay rights. A young female couple I met in Kenya back in 2006 had been forced out of their business as florists because word had got out that they happened to be gay. In Uganda, activists like David Kato would be murdered a few years later, for the simple fact that he was gay. Yet slowly, very slowly, there has been a perceptible shift. Constitutions are being shaken up. But there is still a tangible sense of mistrust between many African nations. Principles of sovereignty and non-interference, just like in many other parts of the world, are jealously guarded. And the settling of old scores between neighbouring continues to be played out in places such as Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo, Sudan and its newer neighbour South Sudan. In many places, the slow roll-out of infrastructure is blamed for underscoring this continued sense of separation and investors say corruption continues to frighten off potential investors. Karen Allen reporting from an internally displaced persons' camp in Chad Yet 2016 saw the creation of the first continent-wide trading bloc. At the moment only 10% of the continent's trade is conducted between African nations. But the potential is huge - 620 million consumers. The political landscape is also being redrawn. Regrettably, I have been banned from working inside Zimbabwe, where Robert Mugabe's leadership persists. And, as I write, the presidents of the Democratic Republic of Congo and The Gambia are resisting pressure to stand down. But transfers of power are happening more peacefully. We have seen it, for instance, in Nigeria, Ghana and Senegal, and maybe also in Angola, where President Jose Eduardo Dos Santos has ruled supreme for the past 37 years but has indicated that he will not stand again for re-election. I never really understood that institutions mattered until I moved to South Africa but, oh, how they do. The country's history may set it apart from other African states but South Africa's constitutional court, its free press and parliament have all challenged the legitimacy of President Jacob Zuma. And no-one has been killed for speaking out. It is a template other nations are keen to follow and I predict that, for many, it will soon come.

Jeremy Bowen: Five issues which shaped the Middle East in 2016,"The past 12 months have marked another restive year for the Middle East, with wars raging, populations suffering and militancy on the rampage. Here the BBC's Middle East editor, Jeremy Bowen, highlights five issues which helped shaped the region in 2016. Some hoped that 2016 would be the beginning of the end for the jihadists of so-called Islamic State (IS). That might become one of the stories of 2017. But those who predicted that IS would fall easily were optimistic. The Iraqi government offensive tore-capture Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city, has stalled. In house-to-house fighting, the Golden Brigade, which was trained by the US military, has suffered a 50% casualty rate, according to the Americans, though this figure is denied by Iraqi military personnel in Baghdad. The Golden Brigade is part of the Iraqi government's elite Counter Terrorism Service (CTS), which has been bearing the brunt of the fight against IS. In early December combat operations in Mosul were slowed down, because the level of casualties meant that the CTS risked running out of trained men. The Iraqi Security Forces have said they will concentrate more on artillery and air operations but that will kill more civilians, which could play into the hands of IS. By the end of the year the battle for Aleppo had been won decisively by a coalition made up of the Syrian state, Russia, Iran, Lebanese Hezbollah and a variety of other militias. It did not mean the end of the war but it was another sign that the war in Syria was entering a new phase. More than ever, it was much more than a fight between the government and those who wanted to destroy it. Increasingly the war is dominated by the agendas of the major powers that have intervened in the Syrian war. One example that affected matters in Aleppo was Turkey's decision to make a priority of its fight with the Kurds. That meant it needed better relations with the Russians, which meant looking away in Aleppo as Russia led the charge against its erstwhile clients, in return for Russian acquiescence in Turkey's actions in northern Syria. In 2017, unless the new ceasefire holds and gives way to meaningful peace talks, more Syrians will die and the war will continue to export crisis, violence and uncertainty. Aleppo: Images of before and after Years of war, corruption and under-development weakened Yemen before the war between the Houthis and a Saudi-led coalition pushed it into catastrophe. Figures are not precise but one estimate is that 10,000 have beenkilled in the warand 37,000 wounded. Many are civilians. According to the UNHCR, the UN's refugee agency, 19 million people in Yemen need urgent assistance. More than half the population has no healthcare. Large numbers of Yemenis have been displaced by the war and are destitute. Every war is brutal but the one in Yemen also features the grotesque sight of the region's wealthiest countries bombing the poorest, helped by the US and Britain who sell vast amounts of weaponry to the Saudis and other coalition allies. Despite all that firepower, the Saudis have not crushed the Houthis, which means that misery and death will be the fate of many Yemenis in 2017. All that is good news for the jihadists of al-Qaeda and Islamic State who have a haven, and a source of recruits, in Yemen. Yemen: How bad is the suffering? The Middle East has one of the youngest populations in the world. Around 60% are under the age of 30. Their sense of hopelessness and anger drove the uprisings of 2011. Five years on, the grievances that sent them out on to the streets in 2011 still exist. Unemployment is still rampant. So is corruption. Egypt has the makings of another perfect storm of repression, discontent, sectarian conflict and economic failure. Syria, Libya and Yemen are gripped by war. Saudi Arabia's leaders have realised that buying off discontent is not a long-term strategy in a world of lower oil prices. There are ambitious plans to transform the economy but there is also the old Saudi problem, that reform is a suspicious idea because change could risk the power of the ruling family and the religious establishment. Their conflict has been largely out of the headlines, drowned out by the tumult coming from the rest of the region. But just because it has been noticed less does not mean that it has gone away. The fundamental causes of all the mutual hatred are present and correct, festering noxiously as they have done for generations. The conflict retains its power to cause rage in people who have never even visited Jerusalem. One Middle Eastern certainty is that it will reignite. Update 6 January 2017: This report has been updated to include an Iraqi response to claims of high casualties among special forces in the fight for Mosul.

Phil Mercer: How are Australia's Syrian refugees coping?,"Australia has resettled abouthalf of the 12,000 refugees it agreed to take in over the past 13 months from the conflict in Syria,but how are they adapting to life in their new country? It is a year since Iymen Baerli, a refugee from Syria, arrived in Sydney with his wife and three young children. Within days, the skies above the harbour of Australia's biggest city sparkled and glowed as arguably the world's finest fireworks display ushered in another new year. The newcomers shared their adopted homeland's optimism about the journey ahead. Iymen, a 52-year old former pharmaceutical sales rep, had ambitions to open up a catering business, helped by his brother, who ran a well-established cake shop in suburban Sydney. But 12 months later much of that hope has withered and the Baerli family are living at their modest apartment in Guildford, a multicultural district 25km (15 miles) from Sydney Opera House. War had forced them out of their home in Homs, Syria's third largest city, and they sought safety in Egypt. Resettlement down under would eventually follow. ""It was very hard moving from Syria to Australia. There are huge differences in the culture and tradition,"" he told me through a translator. ""I have been struggling and it is not easy but I am hoping that in the future it is going to be easier for me."" Iymen's English is rudimentary and, although he is receiving tuition, his lack of language skills has been a major hindrance, as has a chronic back injury. Most of the new arrivals have been staying with relatives in Sydney, but community workers believe that, for many, the transition has been hard. Ahmad Hemmed, a migration agent, who has helped many Syrian families in Sydney, told the BBC that the majority of the refugees have been unable to adapt. ""There are people that after I meet them here after even a year, they do not like the country and they are scared to mix with the Australian community,"" Mr Hemmed explained. ""They are still isolating themselves with similar cultural background people and I think they are raising their kids in the same way, which for me it is really concerning. They live in Australia but they are not actually carrying Australian values."" The city of Homs, dubbed ""the capital of the revolution"" suffered widespread destruction It is a harsh assessment, but officials have conceded that many of those fleeing the Syrian conflict have found life tough in Australia and that finding jobs in particular has not been easy. ""It is that extraordinary mixed feeling,"" said Prof Peter Shergold, the New South Wales co-ordinator general for refugee resettlement. ""At one level I think their first feeling as they get out of the airport is just sheer relief, expectations that they can build a new life, but of course absolute fear of what they have left behind, is this the right decision?"" He believes it is crucial the migrants mix with the broader community. ""They are coming to a society in which 27% of Australians were born overseas and a similar number had a parent born overseas. ""They are coming to a society which is used to diversity and that helps integrate into society and, yes, initially you'll tend to live in areas where other people from your ethnicity or religion live, [but] they need to get outside that if they are going to get employment,"" Prof Shergold added. The remaining 6,000 refugees from the Syrian crisis are expected to arrive in Australia within a year. Immigration minister Peter Dutton has said the refugee resettlement programme might expand But Alex Greenwich, an independent MP in the New South Wales state parliament, believes the humanitarian programme needs to move faster. ""The refugee and asylum seeker immigration process is intensely bureaucratic,"" he said. ""It is much better for a refugee to spend less time in a camp and get into being welcomed into a community. It is better for their health, their mental health. It is obviously something that we should be prioritising and fast-tracking."" In Canberra, the government has indicated it could resettle more of those displaced by atrocities and fighting in Syria. ""If we get this programme right, [it allows us] to say to the Australian people that we may want to expand this programme,"" Immigration Minister Peter Dutton told local media. ""If people have faith in the integrity of the process, then it does give the government the ability to expand beyond the 12,000."" As the conflict grinds on in Syria, 14,000km away in Sydney, Iymen's wife Abir Baerli closely follows developments on Arabic TV channels and online. With relatives and friends still in harm's way in Syria, or seeking sanctuary in neighbouring countries, these are frightening times. ""I am scared and I wish that the war would end,"" she told me with the help of a translator. While her three children - a 10-year old daughter and two younger boys - are at school in Sydney, making friends, playing football and gradually conquering English, Abir and her husband yearn for just one thing - to one day be able to peacefully return home to their beloved Syria.

Nick Higham: Thatcher's poll tax miscalculation,"It was Margaret Thatcher's biggest political misjudgement - and brought her career as prime minister to an ignominious end. The poll tax (or community charge) was supposed to make local council finance fairer and more accountable. Instead it triggered civil disobedience and riots and a rebellion in the Conservative Party. Cabinet papers for 1989 and 1990, released today at the National Archives in Kew, reveal the reaction to the crisis at the heart of government. They show how involved the prime minister herself was. And they pinpoint the moment it dawned on her that her flagship policy had turned into a political disaster which was hitting, not Labour local councils, but her natural supporters. The size of the files alone - there are nine thick manila folders compiled over 18 months - are evidence of how far the poll tax dominated government thinking. Mark Dunton, a specialist in modern records at the National Archives, calls it a ""juggernaut"". Though simple in principle the tax proved to be immensely complex in practice. The files are full of highly technical papers - many of them annotated by Mrs Thatcher. One of the National Archives' specialists says the poll tax files are a ""juggernaut"" They also include a warning from April 1989 that she risked a fine if she didn't complete her own registration form on time. But the technical challenges of introducing the tax paled beside the political problems it threw up. The government had expected opposition to a measure specifically targeted at high-spending, mainly Labour-controlled, councils. What they hadn't expected was the reaction from their own supporters, as the April 1990 date for its introduction in England and Wales drew near. In September the previous year her environment secretary, Chris Patten noted ""a good deal of pressure developing"" and Nigel Lawson, who was to resign as chancellor the following month, told Mrs Thatcher: ""We are faced with a potentially difficult Parliamentary situation."" By January, Patten was telling her there could be as many as 83 rebel MPs on the Tory benches. And she got a powerful sense of the anger among formerly loyal Conservative voters in March when a constituent of the Norfolk MP Ralph Howell wrote to her. Mr WE Jones and his wife were in their 70s, living on modest pensions, and under the poll tax would be paying more than twice what they paid under the old system of rates, while better-off people in large houses would be paying less. He accused the prime minister of being uncaring. A major poll tax demonstration in London in March 1990 ended in violence ""You have taken advantage of your position to impose your will upon us to the point where you are now virtually a Dictator riding roughshod over anyone who opposes you,"" he wrote on 3 March. In the files released today the couple's address has been redacted, though a later memo reveals they lived in a house called Dream of Delight in the village of Great Snoring. Howell asked for a meeting. The prime minister's adviser Mark Lennox-Boyd suggested he should be granted an audience: ""The meeting will be a waste of time, but I am afraid she will have to do it to keep his frustration at bay."" Yet the files suggest it may not have been a waste of time, for this was the point when Mrs Thatcher finally realised that something must be done. She turned not to her environment secretary Chris Patten, who had the job of bringing in the new tax, but to her recently-appointed chancellor, John Major. On 25 March (six days before an enormous demonstration against the poll tax in London which developed into serious rioting) the files contain a ""note for the record"" of a phone conversation between the two. Environment secretary Chris Patten (r) was charged with introducing the poll tax Instead of the tax shining a spotlight on spendthrift local councils, she said, the government was getting the blame for high charges, and the impact was falling on those in middle income groups, what she called the ""conscientious middle"". Major agreed with the need for what he called a ""radical review"" to find a way to cap charges and give local authorities more money, but without increasing overall public expenditure. Over the next two months the files reveal a succession of crisis meetings as ministers desperately tried to find a way out of their predicament, including the perceived unfairness of a system in which ""Dukes and dustmen"" both paid the same. One idea was to raise more money. Should councils be allowed to use cash from the sale of council houses to subsidise the poll tax? Or should people on higher incomes pay more? That idea was floated by the prime minister herself in an unusual signed ""personal minute"" to Major on 9 April. And she had another idea: putting an extra penny on a gallon of petrol and distributing the proceeds to councils. She wrote in the suggestion by hand three times on a memo of 10 April listing options. But none of her colleagues seems to have paid any attention and the idea went nowhere. Michael Portillo says he and Chris Patten wanted to ""take the guts out"" of the poll tax Meanwhile there was a growing split. Patten and the local government minister Michael Portillo wanted to increase central government grants to local authorities. Mrs Thatcher wasn't having it. ""No,"" she wrote firmly in the margin on one occasion. Then she and Major, without apparently consulting Patten, came up with an idea for allowing local councils to levy a higher poll tax than stipulated by central government, provided they first put it to a local referendum (a ""poll tax poll""). Patten was opposed, believing the necessary legislation would be ""massive in its political significance"" and difficult to get through Parliament. One of Mrs Thatcher's private secretaries, Barry Potter, suggested that Patten was feeling ""bruised"" at being ignored. By the end of June Potter told the prime minister that Patten and Portillo, still arguing for more government funds, were now ""isolated"". Today Michael Portillo says he and Chris Patten really wanted to find a way effectively to abolish the poll tax: ""We wanted to take the guts out of it, take the bits that were hurting out of itâ¦ but we recognised for her sensitivity that it would still have to be called the poll tax."" Margaret Thatcher resigned as prime minister in November 1990 They also believed the problem would take central government money to resolve. ""It's worth remembering that when the poll tax was eventually replaced by the council tax, it cost about Â£6bn in money of the day - an enormous amount. And I'm pretty sure that Chris Patten and I were asking for only a fraction of that,"" says Mr Portillo. As to the lessons to be learnt from the debacle, he draws a parallel between the decision to introduce the poll tax ""without thinking it through"" and David Cameron's decision to hold a referendum on Europe without thinking through the consequences. ""The lesson ought to be, think carefully before you do things. But the chances of prime ministers learning that are, I think, slim."" But nothing worked. The practical difficulties and the political pressures were too great and Mrs Thatcher's career was foundering. In November Michael Heseltine, an outspoken critic of the poll tax, triggered a leadership contest from which John Major emerged the winner. He appointed Heseltine as environment secretary, increased VAT to generate extra cash for councils and announced the abolition of the community charge, and its replacement by council tax, in March 1991.
