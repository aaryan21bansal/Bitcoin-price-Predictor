Pimps caught exploiting women on popular website,"This video can not be played Panorama accompanied police on a raid of a suspected brothel A classified ads website is being used to exploit sex workers and trafficked women, a BBC investigation has found. Panorama has evidence that shows pimps are using Vivastreet to advertise multiple women under their control. The programme found that one mobile phone number was being used for 78 ads on the site - which suggests the women might be controlled by a single person. Vivastreet says it is committed to eradicating any potential exploitation. The website, where people also trade cars and household goods, says providing a safe platform is its top priority. The site has an established section for adult listings, and prostitution is legal in the UK as long as the sex workers are acting of their own free will. However, acting as a pimp - exerting control over sex workers for financial gain - is not legal. Panorama analysed data from the site and found that some of the adverts for sex contained the warning signs of sexual exploitation. One such sign is when multiple women are advertised using the same phone number, and the programme found hundreds of examples of this. Many of the adverts also used the same language, including identical phrases and spelling mistakes, which again suggests they were placed by the same person. Trafficked to Europe for sex: An escape story Pandemic may increase people trafficking - charity OnlyFans: How it handles illegal sex videos Diana Johnson, chair of the All Party Parliamentary Group on Commercial Sexual Exploitation, told the programme it was time to get tougher with sites advertising sex for sale. ""Currently in the UK we are a pimp's paradise,"" said the Labour MP. ""Our laws in this country are out of date. I think we need to look at those laws again and actually make them fit for purpose."" There have been numerous prosecutions of pimping and sex trafficking involving people who have used Vivastreet to advertise the women they are exploiting. In one case in the north-west of England, a man - Catalin Mihailescu - spent Â£25,000 placing adverts on Vivastreet in 2017. The website even gave him his own personal account manager. Det Sgt Stuart Peall, who runs the exploitation team at Lancashire Police, told Panorama that the cases he has worked on all involve Vivastreet. ""Every single job is Vivastreet, they advertise over Vivastreet,"" he said. ""It is very common knowledge that if you need sexual services, Vivastreet is the place that you will find it. You can arrange what you want the girl to look like - it's like a takeaway menu."" Panorama investigated a man in Northern Ireland who was running at least three brothels in Belfast and advertising the women on Vivastreet. The programme tracked him as he picked up three different women from the airport and transported them to his brothels. Panorama's evidence suggested he was trafficking women and that they were also being advertised on Vivastreet. The website says it proactively reports suspicious content to police forces around the country and assists with prosecutions. ""We take any allegations of exploitation extremely seriously and have a range of stringent measures in place to detect criminality, remove bad actors and block users identified as high risk,"" says Vivastreet. ""This year alone, more than 29,000 ads have been rejected outright and not allowed on the site."" The company says its staff have been trained so they are alert to the signs of exploitation and know what steps to take if they suspect trafficking. It says it is working with the National Crime Agency and the Home Office to develop an industry-wide approach to preventing exploitation and online trafficking.

Nobel Peace Prize winner Malala ties the knotThe activist and her partner Asser Malik celebrate a nikkah ceremony with family in Birmingham.,"Malala Yousafzai tweeted that it was ""a precious day"" in her life Nobel Peace Prize winner Malala Yousafzai has ""tied the knot"" with her partner during an Islamic ceremony in Birmingham. She and Asser Malik took part in a nikkah ceremony, where bride and groom consent to be married. The 24-year-old activist said it was ""a precious day"" in her life. The Pakistani women's rights activist found refuge in the West Midlands after being shot in the head by the Taliban in 2012. ""Asser and I tied the knot to be partners for life,"" she tweeted on Tuesday, sharing how they had taken part in a ""small nikkah ceremony with family"". ""We are excited to walk together for the journey ahead,"" she added. She posted several photos from the ceremony On Wednesday afternoon, her new husband tweeted a picture of the couple and said in Malala he had found a ""beautiful and kind partner"" and he was ""so excited to spend the rest of our life together"".

Malala, now 24, was 15 when she was targeted by the Taliban in Pakistan for speaking up for the right of girls to be educated. She survived the assault, in which a militant boarded her school bus in north-western Swat valley and opened fire, wounding two of her school friends as well as Malala. After recovering from her near-fatal injuries, she and her family relocated to Birmingham,which she later called ""a second home"". Aged 17, she became the youngest person to win the Nobel Peace Prize. She went on to study at Oxford University, and has become a leading human rights campaigner. Since graduating, Malala has called forbetter support for Afghan refugees,signed a contract with Apple TV+to produce documentaries and appearedon the cover of British Vogue, all while continuing her work to improve girls' access to education. Latest news and updates from the West Midlands Asser Malik is closely associated with cricket and is the High Performance General Manager of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB). A graduate of Lahore's renowned Aitchison College and then Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS), he was also associated with the Pakistan Super League franchise Multan Sultans before joining the PCB, for which he prepared the player development program. While it is not clear how long the couple have known each other, there are pictures of them cheering on Pakistan at Birmingham's Edgbaston Cricket Ground posted on Mr Malik's Instagram account in June 2019. The news of the ceremony was liked tens of thousands of times on social media On its own, a nikkah is not legally recognised under English law and it is unclear whether the couple had a separate civil ceremony. Malala has previously voiced her misgivings around marriage. In an interview with Vogue in July, she said: ""I still don't understand why people have to get married."" ""If you want to have a person in your life, why do you have to sign marriage papers, why can't it just be a partnership?"" she continued. ""My mum is likeâ¦ 'Don't you dare say anything like that! You have to get married, marriage is beautiful'."" The news of the ceremony was liked tens of thousands of times by fans online, with thousands wishing the couple well. Among those to offer their congratulations on Twitter were Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau, Jemima Goldsmith and MP Sajid Javid.

Which MPs have second jobs?,"Prime Minister Boris Johnson is proposing to ban MPs from acting as paid political consultants. The Labour leader,Sir Keir Starmer has been calling for this to happen, saying the ban would help end ""dodgy lobbying"". The planned shake up of the rules comes afterOwen Paterson was found to have broken lobbying rules- which led to the issue of MPs' second jobs coming under scrutiny. Questions have been raised aboutthe Conservative MP and former attorney general Sir Geoffrey Coxwho earned around Â£900,000 last year through his work as a lawyer. MPs under scrutiny over their second jobs Yes, as long as they are not a minister. More than 200 MPs have received earnings in the last year on top oftheir Â£81,932 annual salary,external. The extra earnings range from Â£50 a year to almost Â£1m. This video can not be played Boris Johnson on MPs' standards: ""We take all this very seriously"" MPs mustpublicly declare,externalany additional income, along with gifts, donations and shareholdings over 15%. Those who leave government must consult the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments about any jobs they want to take up in the two years after leaving their post.They are banned from lobbying the government for two years.,external All MPs are ""strictly forbidden"" from getting paid ""in return for advocating a particular matter"" in Parliament. PM's actions over Paterson corrupt - Starmer What did Owen Paterson do? In full: Owen Paterson resignation statement Having MPs with second professions has previously been seen as a good thing. In 1995, the standards committee said that not having them would""not serve the best interests of democracy"",external. It argued that Parliament needed ""a wide range of current experience which can contribute to its expertise"". Former minister Owen Paterson resigned as an MP to escape ""the cruel world of politics"" The current debate is mainly regarding MPs who earn money as consultants or advisers. Less controversial second jobs range from doctors and nurses, to referees and musicians. The following MPs have registered income from consultancy work on theRegister of Members' Financial Interests,externalin the last year. There is no suggestion that any of the MPs listed below have broken any rules. Andrew Mitchell (Conservative) holds six consultancy jobs, supporting investment banks and accountancy firms. He has registered more than Â£180,000 for 34.5 days' work Julian Smith (Conservative) is earning Â£144,000 for 62-84 hours' work for three companies, including advising on energy and renewable fuels Former transport and justice secretary Chris Grayling (Conservative) earns Â£100,000 to advise Hutchison Ports Mark Garnier (Conservative) is paid to sit on the advisory boards of two companies in the space and satellite industry, committing 20 hours a month for an annual payment of Â£90,000 Sir Ed Davey (Lib Dem) works as a consultant for two firms alongside his job as leader of the Liberal Democrats. He says his extra Â£78,000 income goes towards supporting his disabled son Alun Cairns (Conservative), who left his post as Welsh Secretary in 2019, earns Â£60,000 advising three companies Ruth Edwards (Conservative), who has represented Rushcliffe since 2019, commits to 192 hours for Â£60,000 per year, advising a software company Stephen Hammond (Conservative) advises an investment company on political issues for Â£60,000 a year Since leaving his role as health minister in 2019, Steve Brine (Conservative) has joined three firms, including Sigma Pharmaceuticals. He earns almost Â£60,000 for 288 hours David Davis (Conservative) earns just over Â£50,000 as an adviser to two German companies John Hayes (Conservative) offers up to 90 hours of his time annually to international energy company BB Energy Trading, earning Â£50,000 Former party leader and cabinet minister Iain Duncan Smith (Conservative) advises two health companies for Â£45,000 Damian Green (Conservative) advises transport company Abellio on rail policy for 288 hours and Â£40,000 annually Tim Loughton (Conservative) receives Â£37,000 for advising a children's services provider Daniel Kawczynski (Conservative) provides ""general advice"" to an American mining firm, earning Â£36,000 a year Andrew Percy (Conservative) receives Â£36,000 a year for advising a Canadian clean energy company for six hours a month Khalid Mahmood (Labour) has committed up to 15 hours a month advising the Policy Exchange think tank on issues including extremism. He receives a salary of Â£25,000 a year Laurence Robertson (Conservative) advises the Betting and Gaming Council for Â£24,000 a year. He is expected to commit 10 hours a month Richard Fuller's (Conservative) outside earnings include Â£20,000 as an advisory director of an investment company Chair of the House of Commons justice committee Sir Bob Neill (Conservative) has been receiving almost Â£20,000 for two consultancy roles, including a law firm.

Some of the highest earners in the House of Commons are lawyers. The Conservative MP Sir Geoffrey Cox earned hundreds of thousands of pounds as a lawyer last year. Sir Geoffrey Cox, who was attorney general during the height of the Brexit negotiations, has registered almost Â£900,000 in the last year for around 1,000 hours of legal work. This included travelling to the British Virgin Islands (BVI) to advise on a corruption inquiry. He was there for a number of weeks, meaning he was carrying out his work as an MP - including voting - from the Caribbean. Sir Geoffrey has beenreferred by Labourto the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards for apparently taking part in a virtual meeting for a client while in his Commons office. The Conservative MP hasdenied breaching the rules. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, who is also a barrister, has made more than Â£100,000 for legal work, writing and making speeches since becoming an MP in 2015. There is no suggestion he has done anything against the rules, and Sir Keir says all the work was carried out before he became leader last year. A number of MPs are also employed as doctors and nurses. Some have continued to work on the NHS front line during the pandemic.

Covid pass extended to Wales' cinemas and theatres,"Anyone aged over 16 will have to show a Covid pass to get into a cinema or theatre under the new rules People going to cinemas and theatres in Wales will be required to show a Covid pass after the Welsh government won a vote in the Senedd. Currently, visitors to nightclubs and large events have to show they are fully vaccinated, have tested negative for Covid or have recently had the virus to enter. From Monday, it will be extended to cinemas, theatres and concert halls. Labour ministers won the vote after Plaid Cymru backed the plans. Anyone aged over 16 in Wales canget an NHS Covid pass,externalif they are fully vaccinated or have had a negative lateral flow test in the previous 48 hours. The new law passed with 39Members of the Seneddvoting for and 15 against, with the Welsh Conservatives and Liberal Democrat Jane Dodds opposed. What is a Covid pass and how do I get one? First day of Covid passes in Wales Covid passes introduced in Welsh sport On Tuesday night, Big Brother Watch, a civil liberties campaign, said it was starting legal proceedings against the Welsh government, calling the scheme ""authoritarian, invasive and unevidenced"". But Labour said the Covid pass was popular and Health Minister Eluned Morgan said the extension was designed to keep cinemas and theatres open over the winter months. Hundreds of protesters gathered on the Senedd steps in Cardiff Bay on Tuesday, amid concerns the passes unreasonably restrict personal freedom. The vote was in contrast to October when ministers won the first Covid pass decisionby a single vote when one Conservative MS was unable to log on to Zoom to vote remotely. At the time the Welsh government - which holds exactly half of the 60 seats in the Senedd - had faced defeat with the whole opposition, including Plaid, against the plans. Steve Reynolds said he felt cinemas and theatres were being ""singled out"" The planned extension had divided opinion among those working in cinemas and theatres. Cardiff Bay's Wales Millennium Centre said it welcomed any moves that would ensure the safety of its audiences and allow it to remain open, particularly before Christmas. Steve Reynolds, director of Picturedrome Cinemas, which runs Maxime cinema in Blackwood, said he felt cinemas and theatres were being ""singled out"". He worried about the impact it could have on the trade: ""Cinemas won't survive if they have a dramatic fall in business"". Public Health Wales gives the latest seven day average Covid case rate as 527.7 per 100,000 people. But Ms Morgan told a Senedd debate the case rate was still ""very high"" and has been increasing in some areas. ""Our aim is to avoid having to close sectors or reintroduce restrictions,"" she said, claiming ""the vast majority of the Welsh public are with us"". Conservative constitutional spokesman Darren Millar said there were ""many ethical and equality issues with Covid passes"", repeating concerns that results from lateral flow devices are self-declared. ""You can swab your dog and put its result in that system and still get your vaccine passport to be able to attend any event, nightclub, cinema theatre or anywhere else, it is ridiculous."" Covid passes are already required for nightclubs and large events Plaid health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth indicated last week the party was likely to back the extension, but its stance was not confirmed until Tuesday lunchtime. He said: ""Plaid Cymru has made it clear throughout this pandemic that we'll support evidence-based actions that can help limit transmission and keep the people of Wales safe. ""After examining the evidence, including that provided by the Welsh government, we are willing to support extending the passes to help mitigate the transmission of Covid."" Welsh Liberal Democrat leader Ms Dodds said her opposition was ""foremost"" about ""the lack of evidence"". She told the Senedd she had still not received any evidence that the passes ""work to reduce transmission or to improve the uptake of the vaccine"". The vote took place as the Labour government continues tonegotiates a co-operation deal with Plaidin Cardiff Bay. The parties have been discussing working together for months, as Labour lacks an outright majority, but they are not expected to enter a formal coalition. Nightlife industry group NTIA, which has opposed the Covid pass scheme from the start, said cinemas and theatres would experience ""significant challenges"". Chief executive Michael Kill added: ""There is a huge concern throughout the hospitality and night time economy sectors that Welsh government will take this even further to encompass more businesses, which without a doubt will cripple the industries involved.""

Scottish vaccine passport scheme could be expanded,"People attending nightclubs and other large venues in Scotland have to be able to show proof of two Covid jabs Scotland's vaccine passport scheme could be expanded to more hospitality and leisure venues amid fears of a new wave of Covid-19 cases over winter. Deputy First Minister John Swinney said the rules may need to be tightened in order to prevent a return to lockdown. This could also include requiring face coverings to be used in more settings, and more home working. Opposition parties said the ""vague"" announcement would be of ""significant concern"" to businesses. Any changes will be confirmed at the next review of the restrictions on 16 November. What do we know about Scotland's vaccine passport? Why are Covid cases flatlining in Scotland? People over the age of 18 currently need to show proof of vaccination in order to enter nightclubs and large events such as football matches and concerts. The move has been controversial, with all opposition parties at Holyrood voting against it. There was also anunsuccessful legal challengeby the hospitality industry andteething problems with the appsused to administer the scheme. Mr Swinney told MSPs that the range of venues required to check vaccine status could be expanded in an attempt to head off a ""dangerous"" situation over the winter - and in particular the Christmas period. The deputy first minister said the country was in a ""precarious and unpredictable"" position, with case numbers remaining at a ""concerningly high level"" and ""intense pressure"" on the NHS. He said it was reasonable to suspect case numbers could rise over the winter period, with colder weather increasing the amount of time people spend socialising indoors and concerns about the COP26 conference. However, the test positivity results for Blue Zone pass-holders at the conference, based on lateral flow tests, was only about 0.1% last week. All entrants to the central area of the climate conference must show proof of a negative lateral flow Covid-19 test, unless exempt, on each day they enter the site. This video can not be played John Swinney said Covid cases may rise over winter as more people socialise indoors Mr Swinney said: ""It is because we want to avoid more difficult restrictions that we cannot rule out strengthening the baseline protective measures currently in place as the best way to head off any prospect of future lockdowns. ""We have been considering whether we may need to extend the Covid certification scheme to bring more settings into scope, such as further indoor hospitality and leisure settings. ""Among other possible interventions, we are exploring how we can help improve ventilation, what we could do to increase home working, and whether changes are needed to extend use of face masks. ""I would stress though that we have not yet taken any decisions about strengthening the existing baseline measures, and we will be discussing options with business sector organisations this week."" Some business groups hit out at the suggestion that restrictions could increase ahead of the normally busy festive period. Liz Cameron, chief executive of the Scottish Chambers of Commerce, said it was ""essential we don't take a massive step backwards through the introduction of further economic deterrents"". She said ministers should ""urgently get round the table with businesses to demonstrate the evidence for ramping up restrictions and detail what financial support they will make available if they choose to do so"". And David Lonsdale of the Scottish Retail Consortium said he was ""sceptical of the value"" of Covid passports in stores, coffee shops and restaurants, saying there would be ""practical and operational challenges"". He also said a push for more working from home would impact on shopper footfall for city centre stores, saying this was still significantly below pre-pandemic levels. Football supporters have to show Covid certificates to get into larger games in Scotland Opposition parties were critical of the lack of detail of Mr Swinney's statement, with Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross pressing for clarity about what venues could be affected. He said: ""How can this government take these plans forward when they know the damage the scheme is already doing to Scottish businesses, and the impact it is having on people's jobs? ""Exactly which venues will be impacted by this change? This only brings more uncertainty for businesses sat an extremely difficult time - they need to know if they are on the cusp of being hit by added costs and extra hassle."" Scottish Labour MSP Daniel Johnson questioned whether the government would consider allowing a negative test to be submitted in lieu of proof of vaccination, with the deputy first minister saying this was under consideration. Mr Johnson added: ""It will be of significant concern to all of those running hospitality businesses what the deputy first minister has stated in terms of the prospect of rolling out vaccine passports yet to more contexts, especially given the broad and non-specific nature of his statement. ""While nightclubs have door staff and a natural point to check these things, cafes don't tend to - so the practicalities of checking passports in these settings are hugely more challenging."" Meanwhile Scottish Lib Dem leader Alex Cole-Hamilton said there was ""no evidence base"" for the use of vaccine passports, adding: ""They will not save Christmas.""

'Covid nursing shifts left me inconsolable',"A nurse who worked in ICU through the pandemic has said she had to leave the profession because the pressure was too much to bear. Former critical care nurse Chloe Burke told BBC Scotland she felt selfish leaving but did not see another option. She said many of her colleagues had told her they would leave too if they had other jobs to go to. Unions have warned of the impact of staffing shortages with a 7% nursing and midwifery vacancy rate. Chloe said other nurses had encouraged her to speak up about the pressures they are currently facing. She said many of them would like to speak up but feel unable to while they still work for the NHS. Chloe qualified as a nurse four years ago. During the pandemic she worked in intensive care at an Edinburgh hospital, looking after the sickest patients. She said staff shortages, sickness, and ongoing pressures made it harder and harder to do her job. ""No-one could help,"" she said. ""Management couldn't help, everyone was trying to do their best in order to cover the shifts, but you don't have the manpower and you see your colleagues are suffering so try and cover more shifts so you are doing more than you should be doing. ""You just become more tired, and that goes for most nurses"" In August this year she decided she had to step away. She said: ""I didn't think I would have to come to that decision. I didn't realise how much of an impact it was going to have on me, my mental health and my physical health. ""I started to have panic attacks and feel so overwhelmed, there were a few shifts when I came home and I was in tears and I was inconsolable"" ""I couldn't sustain things."" Chloe said some of her colleagues would have panic attacks when they put on their PPE Recruiting nurses has been a long-term issue for the NHS. Despite record numbers of staff working for the health service,recent figures from the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) show more than 7% of nursing and midwifery posts are vacant,external- that's a record high and equates to almost 5,000 posts. Unions have warned that shortages are compromising patient care. While other unions have accepted a 4% pay offer, the RCN is to announceresults of a ballot on industrial actionlater this week. Hilary Nelson, a ICU nurse and safety representative with the RCN, said the pay deal was critical for attracting more people to the profession and stopping nurses leaving. She told BBC Radio'sGood Morning Scotland: ""Nursing is tired. It's suffering a lot of stress and the pressure is not going away. ""There are not enough nurses for our members to do the job they are expected to do. We just don't have the workforce to do the job in hand. ""If you pay nurses more it will attract people into the profession."" Scottish government Health Secretary Humza Yousaf said: ""NHS Scotland nurses are the best paid in the UK, and the pay deal, which has been agreed by the majority of unions and NHS staff, is the biggest pay rise in at least 20 years which saw staff receive an average 4% pay increase backdated to 1 December 2020. ""Every staff member up to and including Band 7 got an uplift of at least Â£1,000."" Chloe said the public did not appreciate the toll the job takes on nurses - especially during the pandemic, when she said it was ""very scary"" to work in ICU. For example, she said she saw former colleagues have panic attacks as they put on their PPE. She added: ""We have to unfortunately be the hand to hold as someone passes away, that's very, very hard. They are the things people don't know you go through as a nurse."" Sometimes she would not see her partner for three weeks because of her shifts. She often felt compelled to do extra shifts because she could see how much her colleagues were struggling when they were short staffed. Leaving nursing was not about the money, but she said she did feel undervalued. Vacancies in nursing and midwifery are at a record high She's now moved back to the Irish countryside to work in the family business while she studies, before embarking on a new career in the property market. She says she would love to return to nursing - but it would take a big change in working conditions for her to consider it. ""I felt so guilty, really really guilty that I was leaving all my colleagues and the profession and guilty as well for the patients. ""And sad because I really, really enjoyed it and the friends I've made there and the people that I worked with were one of a kind, but I had to be selfish unfortunately.""

Cinema and theatre Covid passes agreed by Senedd,"Anyone aged over 16 will have to show a Covid pass to get into a cinema or theatre under the new rules People going to cinemas and theatres in Wales will be required to show a Covid pass after the Welsh government won a vote in the Senedd. Currently, visitors to nightclubs and large events have to show they are fully vaccinated, have tested negative for Covid or have recently had the virus to enter. From Monday, it will be extended to cinemas, theatres and concert halls. Labour ministers won the vote after Plaid Cymru backed the plans. Anyone aged over 16 in Wales canget an NHS Covid pass,externalif they are fully vaccinated or have had a negative lateral flow test in the previous 48 hours. The new law passed with 39Members of the Seneddvoting for and 15 against, with the Welsh Conservatives and Liberal Democrat Jane Dodds opposed. What is a Covid pass and how do I get one? First day of Covid passes in Wales Covid passes introduced in Welsh sport On Tuesday night, Big Brother Watch, a civil liberties campaign, said it was starting legal proceedings against the Welsh government, calling the scheme ""authoritarian, invasive and unevidenced"". But Labour said the Covid pass was popular and Health Minister Eluned Morgan said the extension was designed to keep cinemas and theatres open over the winter months. Hundreds of protesters gathered on the Senedd steps in Cardiff Bay on Tuesday, amid concerns the passes unreasonably restrict personal freedom. The vote was in contrast to October when ministers won the first Covid pass decisionby a single vote when one Conservative MS was unable to log on to Zoom to vote remotely. At the time the Welsh government - which holds exactly half of the 60 seats in the Senedd - had faced defeat with the whole opposition, including Plaid, against the plans. Steve Reynolds said he felt cinemas and theatres were being ""singled out"" The planned extension had divided opinion among those working in cinemas and theatres. Cardiff Bay's Wales Millennium Centre said it welcomed any moves that would ensure the safety of its audiences and allow it to remain open, particularly before Christmas. Steve Reynolds, director of Picturedrome Cinemas, which runs Maxime cinema in Blackwood, said he felt cinemas and theatres were being ""singled out"". He worried about the impact it could have on the trade: ""Cinemas won't survive if they have a dramatic fall in business"". Public Health Wales gives the latest seven day average Covid case rate as 527.7 per 100,000 people. But Ms Morgan told a Senedd debate the case rate was still ""very high"" and has been increasing in some areas. ""Our aim is to avoid having to close sectors or reintroduce restrictions,"" she said, claiming ""the vast majority of the Welsh public are with us"". Conservative constitutional spokesman Darren Millar said there were ""many ethical and equality issues with Covid passes"", repeating concerns that results from lateral flow devices are self-declared. ""You can swab your dog and put its result in that system and still get your vaccine passport to be able to attend any event, nightclub, cinema theatre or anywhere else, it is ridiculous."" Covid passes are already required for nightclubs and large events Plaid health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth indicated last week the party was likely to back the extension, but its stance was not confirmed until Tuesday lunchtime. He said: ""Plaid Cymru has made it clear throughout this pandemic that we'll support evidence-based actions that can help limit transmission and keep the people of Wales safe. ""After examining the evidence, including that provided by the Welsh government, we are willing to support extending the passes to help mitigate the transmission of Covid."" Welsh Liberal Democrat leader Ms Dodds said her opposition was ""foremost"" about ""the lack of evidence"". She told the Senedd she had still not received any evidence that the passes ""work to reduce transmission or to improve the uptake of the vaccine"". The vote took place as the Labour government continues tonegotiates a co-operation deal with Plaidin Cardiff Bay. The parties have been discussing working together for months, as Labour lacks an outright majority, but they are not expected to enter a formal coalition. Nightlife industry group NTIA, which has opposed the Covid pass scheme from the start, said cinemas and theatres would experience ""significant challenges"". Chief executive Michael Kill added: ""There is a huge concern throughout the hospitality and night time economy sectors that Welsh government will take this even further to encompass more businesses, which without a doubt will cripple the industries involved.""

Bouncers suspended after altercation with women,"This video can not be played Footage shows altercation between bouncers and clubbers Three nightclub bouncers have been suspended over an altercation with two women. Video footage of the confrontation has been circulated on social media since it happened outside Stealth in Nottingham at the weekend. One of the women, Niamh Watson, said door staff had been abusive to her friend before they were thrown out and attacked. Stealth said it was ""appalled"" by the footage and was investigating. The videos were filmed outside the club in Goldsmith Street at about 02:25 GMT on Sunday. One clip shows a bouncer throwing Ms Watson to the floor outside before another drags her along the pavement back towards the nightclub. Another shows her being pushed up against some railings as she screams ""get off me"". At the same time her friend appears to hit one of the bouncers before he also throws her to the ground with force. Stealth said it would be providing CCTV footage to police Ms Watson said: ""They were attacking my friend so I went over to try and help her and to get them off and next thing they've floored me and they've dragged me back into the venue and just held me against the gate. ""I couldn't breathe - I know it sounds dramatic but for a minute I genuinely thought he was going to kill me. ""I thought 'I need to get out this situation' so I was just screaming and trying to get out."" Nottinghamshire Police said it was ""proactively investigating"" the incident and asked for witnesses to come forward. Insp Paul Gummer said: ""Officers were called to reports of an altercation in Masonic Place at 2.38am on Sunday 8 November. ""After talking to those involved, and independent witnesses, officers dispersed the group and provided first-aid treatment to a woman. ""The following morning the injured woman reported an earlier incident that happened prior to our arrival and enquiries are ongoing into that report."" DHP Family, which runs Stealth, said police were called on the night and officers questioned customers and the door staff involved, and said it would assist officers in providing CCTV footage. In a statement, it said: ""We're appalled by the video footage circulating regarding an incident outside our venues on Goldsmith Street. ""We understand how distressing they are and have taken the immediate decision to suspend the door staff involved while we carry out an investigation. ""We will also be reviewing Professional Security, the company which is contracted to provide security staff, to assess its suitability to continue supplying door staff to our venues. ""This will include looking at their code of conduct and training."" Mike Kill, chief executive of the Night Time Industries Association (NTIA) said the actions of the bouncers in the video were ""horrendous"" and ""not a representation of the professionalism out there"". He added: ""It's very difficult to understand what has actually happened but what we can see from it is that manhandling people should be the last resort and definitely a gentleman working as licensed security shouldn't be manhandling a lady in any way or pushing them to the floor. ""That is just way, way too far. ""I understand from the nightclub owners they are dealing with this very seriously and I'm sure they will take the right course of action, but it is not a wider representation of the wider industry who act very professionally. ""That was just horrendous behaviour. ""But I can only reassure people that this is a very isolated incident among many, many that happen up and down the country that are dealt with very professionally.""

Pimps caught trafficking women on popular website,"This video can not be played Panorama accompanied police on a raid of a suspected brothel A classified ads website is being used to exploit sex workers and trafficked women, a BBC investigation has found. Panorama has evidence that shows pimps are using Vivastreet to advertise multiple women under their control. The programme found that one mobile phone number was being used for 78 ads on the site - which suggests the women might be controlled by a single person. Vivastreet says it is committed to eradicating any potential exploitation. The website, where people also trade cars and household goods, says providing a safe platform is its top priority. The site has an established section for adult listings, and prostitution is legal in the UK as long as the sex workers are acting of their own free will. However, acting as a pimp - exerting control over sex workers for financial gain - is not legal. Panorama analysed data from the site and found that some of the adverts for sex contained the warning signs of sexual exploitation. One such sign is when multiple women are advertised using the same phone number, and the programme found hundreds of examples of this. Many of the adverts also used the same language, including identical phrases and spelling mistakes, which again suggests they were placed by the same person. Trafficked to Europe for sex: An escape story Pandemic may increase people trafficking - charity OnlyFans: How it handles illegal sex videos Diana Johnson, chair of the All Party Parliamentary Group on Commercial Sexual Exploitation, told the programme it was time to get tougher with sites advertising sex for sale. ""Currently in the UK we are a pimp's paradise,"" said the Labour MP. ""Our laws in this country are out of date. I think we need to look at those laws again and actually make them fit for purpose."" There have been numerous prosecutions of pimping and sex trafficking involving people who have used Vivastreet to advertise the women they are exploiting. In one case in the north-west of England, a man - Catalin Mihailescu - spent Â£25,000 placing adverts on Vivastreet in 2017. The website even gave him his own personal account manager. Det Sgt Stuart Peall, who runs the exploitation team at Lancashire Police, told Panorama that the cases he has worked on all involve Vivastreet. ""Every single job is Vivastreet, they advertise over Vivastreet,"" he said. ""It is very common knowledge that if you need sexual services, Vivastreet is the place that you will find it. You can arrange what you want the girl to look like - it's like a takeaway menu."" Panorama investigated a man in Northern Ireland who was running at least three brothels in Belfast and advertising the women on Vivastreet. The programme tracked him as he picked up three different women from the airport and transported them to his brothels. Panorama's evidence suggested he was trafficking women and that they were also being advertised on Vivastreet. The website says it proactively reports suspicious content to police forces around the country and assists with prosecutions. ""We take any allegations of exploitation extremely seriously and have a range of stringent measures in place to detect criminality, remove bad actors and block users identified as high risk,"" says Vivastreet. ""This year alone, more than 29,000 ads have been rejected outright and not allowed on the site."" The company says its staff have been trained so they are alert to the signs of exploitation and know what steps to take if they suspect trafficking. It says it is working with the National Crime Agency and the Home Office to develop an industry-wide approach to preventing exploitation and online trafficking.

Food price rises highest since August 2020,"Food prices are rising at their fastest pace since August 2020, figures from data firm Kantar suggest, as supply chain disruption continues. Grocery inflation rose to 2.1% in October - the highest rate since last year, when retailers were cutting promotions amid the Covid pandemic. Last week, the Bank of England confounded market expectations by holding interest rates. But with overall inflation heading for about 5%, a rate rise is expected soon. Supply chains have been under pressure from factors including the pandemic and a shortage of lorry drivers. Retail and hospitality groups warned MPs on Tuesday that gaps on shelves and inflationary pressures would continue for the months ahead. Kantar said that the fastest rising food prices included savoury snacks, canned colas and crisps. However, prices fell for products such as fresh bacon, vegetables and cat and dog treats. Bank of England sorry for rising cost of living Why is the cost of living going up? ""Grocery prices are rising and this month inflation hit its highest rate since August 2020, when retailers were still cutting promotions to maintain stock on the shelves,"" said Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar. ""As prices increase in certain categories, we can expect shoppers to continue to visit several supermarkets and shop around to find the best deals."" Official figures showed overall UK inflation dipped slightly in September, with the rate falling to 3.1% in the year to September, down from 3.2% in October. However, Shore Capital research analyst Clive Black said that some people were ""struggling to believe"" the inflation numbers from the Office for National Statistics. He said the figures were ""increasingly treated not with scepticism but incredulity as prices from fuel, energy, food, and building materials rise, offset by what?"" Fuel and oil prices have risen rapidly as economies start to pick up after being battered by the coronavirus pandemic, and as the Opec oil producers' cartel gradually increases output. Shortages and bottlenecks in goods including building materials and computer chips have also pushed up prices. Prices of crisps, cola and snacks are among those rising fastest Businesses are having difficulties recruiting workers to drive lorries, pick and process food and to staff bars, hotels and restaurants. This is partly to do with the pandemic but is being compounded by Brexit,according to international policy forum the OECD. However, the Bank of England's deputy governor Ben Broadbent stated the pandemic is having a greater impact on labour shortages than Brexit currently. Mr Broadbent stressed that it's not just a case of losing migrants as workers - but also their spending power in the economy, as many EU workers were younger and economically active. He added the pandemic has led to a fall in the active workforce that is ""not unique"" to the UK, shown by the retirement of HGV drivers and younger restaurant staff choosing to go into education. Kate Nicholls, chief executive officer of UK Hospitality, warned that prices charged by hospitality businesses such as restaurants, bars and hotels were set to rise after Christmas. Speaking to the House of Commons Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee on Tuesday, she said that many Christmas events offered by her members had been pre-booked, which made it harder to push through price increases to cover higher costs. ""You're going to see a really intense squeeze on margins in the run-up to Christmas,"" she said, but then prices were likely to rise in the new year. ""Some of our businesses are anticipating three price increases to consumers going through before we get to April."" Andrew Opie, director of food and sustainability at the British Retail Consortium, told MPs it ""will be Christmas as we know it"" in shops, but the range of products will be reduced, as is already the case in lots of food categories. Several retailers havereported that customers are planning ahead for Christmasand shopping early amid concerns over shortages of stock. Kantar data supported this, with the firm saying that 4.7 million households bought mince pies this month. M&S: Customers are Christmas shopping early Shoppers warned to buy early for Christmas or miss out Frozen poultry sales are 27% higher compared with last year, with people spending an additional Â£6.1m in the past four weeks. In addition, 1.6 million households bought their Christmas pudding in October as well, which is 400,000 more than last year, Kantar said. Customers are getting used to seeing gaps on shelves, and menu items missing in restaurants, and we're already shopping differently as a result. Gone are the days of the Christmas Eve mega-shop where you pile everything you need into an impossible to push trolley. Now we're buying early, freezing more, and throwing in a few extra bits when they are available, just in case. It's almost impossible for businesses to predict what those holes will be from one week to the next, as worker shortages in the supply chain continue to cause problems. That means we'll not only be shopping around to try and save money as prices rise, but we'll also have to try different stores at different moments just to get everything on the list.

Astroworld tragedy: Were warning signs missed?,"Scott was performing in front of his home crowd in Houston, Texas For almost 40 minutes after Houston police and firefighters responded to a ""mass casualty"" event at Travis Scott's packed Astroworld music festival on Friday, the superstar continued to perform. By the time he left the stage, it had become one of the deadliest concerts in US history. Eight people died and dozens more were injured. Fans were filmed chanting ""stop the show"" and pleading for staff to help. One even climbed onto a camera platform to point out the injured. Scott eventually ended his set about 15 to 20 minutes ahead of the advertised time. But questions remain about why it didn't finish sooner. ""Nine thirty, right there. That's when a few people started going down,"" Houston police chief Troy Finner said at a press conference on Saturday. ""Our people stepped up and immediately went to the producers and told them, 'Hey, we got people going down.' This show ended at 10:10pm. I just wanted to acknowledge that."" Scott, one of the biggest names in rap music, launched the event with concert promoters Live Nation in 2018. He said in an Instagram video that he was not aware how bad things had become during his headline set this year. ""Any time I could make out anything that's going on, I just stopped the show and helped them get the help they need,"" he said. ""I could just never imagine the severity of the situation."" Infootage from the concert,external, he can be seen interrupting his performance to ask for help for a fan who had passed out. However in anotheranother video,external, he can be heard saying during another break: ""Who asked you to stop? Y'all know what y'all came to do - chase me, let's go."" The rapper is known for his wild shows, and has been in trouble for inciting dangerous behaviour in the past. In 2015, he was charged with disorderly conduct afterencouraging fans in Chicago,externalto ignore security and rush the stage. Two years later, he spotted a fan hanging from a venue's second-storey balcony and tried to persuade them to jump. At the same concert, a 27-year-old fan was paralysed after being pushed off a third-floor balcony. In 2019, hundreds of fans rushed the Astroworld barriers, with three people going to hospital with minor injuries. Policewrote on Twitter that the event was understaffed,externaland that ""promoters did not plan sufficiently for the large crowds"", although the statement was later deleted. Fears about crowd safety had been raised before this year's event. A security planobtained by the New York Times,externaladdressed several areas of concern. ""Based on the site's layout and numerous past experiences, the potential for multiple alcohol/drug related incidents, possible evacuation needs, and the ever-present threat of a mass casualty situation are identified as key concerns,"" the document read. Before Scott took to the stage, local news teams filmedfans bursting through gates,externaland bypassing security checkpoints. The city's police chief also visited the star in his dressing room to convey concerns about the energy in the crowd. In a statement,external, Chief Finner said the ""brief and respectful meeting"" allowed him to ""share my public safety concerns"" and ask the star ""to be mindful of his team's social media messaging on any unscheduled events."" This video can not be played Astroworld security officer ""felt a prick in his neck"" â Houston Police Chief Troy Finner So how could this tragedy happen? Investigators will look at a number of factors, says Simon Ancliffe, founder of Movement Strategies, which advises major UK events like Glastonbury, Reading & Leeds and the 2012 Olympics on crowd safety. ""Have they controlled numbers? Are there barriers in place and were they well designed? Were security staff doing what they're supposed to do? Did they have good situational awareness? Did they have CCTV? ""They did seem have to some kind of procedure to stop the show, but it seemed to stop and start - so was [the situation] about communications, was it about decision making?"" When tragedies occur, he says, it's often not about one bad decision but an accumulation of smaller mistakes that ultimately lead to catastrophe. In this case, ""it sounds like a lot of things went wrong"". ""It all comes down to planning,"" says Keith Still, a professor of crowd science at the University of Sussex. ""You need to anticipate that this type of performer in that type of environment will induce this type of behaviour in the crowd - and you put crowd management and monitoring systems in place to make sure that you've got an early warning indicator."" A makeshift memorial has sprung up outside the NRG park where Astroworld was held Ancliffe says the teams on the ground are not necessarily to blame. ""The security staff on the barriers can see what's immediately in front of them, but [only] a few people deep,"" he says, explaining that frontline staff need back-up in the form of CCTV or a more elevated view of the audience. In the UK, ""we have experienced crowd managers with a really good view of the crowd from a raised position, so you can see people's faces and look for the change in expression"", says Eric Stuart, chair of the UK Crowd Management Association. ""There's always going to be people screaming because they're having fun. The skill and the artform is looking at the faces and listening to the screams and saying, 'That's different. Things have changed.'"" Many people in an audience often aren't aware of a life-threatening situation until it's too late. US festival survivors recall crush panic Travis Scott sued over deadly US festival crush Star 'devastated' by Texas festival deaths ""When you're in a crowd, you can't see more than a couple of people in front of you, and you can't hear what's going on because of the music,"" says Ancliffe. ""So there's really bad information transfer within the crowd. ""If people are pushing forwards, they can't see what's in front of them. And once you've fallen down, it's very difficult to get up again, unless people are helping you. And if people have bent over to help you, then they can be pushed over very easily as well."" So it's up to staff to identify problems and alert the performer, who can pause the show and calm the situation. In this case, it was the audience who notified security and were ""asking for things to change"", says Ancliffe. ""So what was the situational awareness? What was the decision making? There may be other factors involved, but those will probably be the things where the disaster happened."" Set times for the festival show that Scott was due to perform without competition Some experts have also suggested Scott's decision to play on a separate stage with no other acts scheduled at the same time could have exacerbated the situation. That goes against a common practice in crowd management, known as ""spreading the field"", where organisers arrange several competing headliners or stagger stage times to control the flow of fans. But Scott's performance came 45 minutes after SZA had ended the day's final set on Astroworld's second stage. Fans who had been gathering near the barriers of his $5m ""Utopia Mountain"" arena since lunchtime were suddenly met with an influx of revellers, hyped up by a massive countdown clock heralding the star's arrival. ""The crux of the problem likely happened as the clock got close to zero,""one unnamed source told Variety magazine,external. One teenage fan said she got into difficulties almost immediately. ""Once Travis Scott came on, I told myself this is the moment I've been preparing for, I just need to breathe,""Diana Amira told NBC news,external. ""But... my ribcage was so squished that I couldn't expand my lungs to catch a breath."" This video can not be played ""He died saving his fiancee"" - Basil Baig's brother died at the festival Thankfully, crowd-related deaths at music events are relatively few and far between. ""The first thing to say is that if you have an experienced crowd team on site, it won't reach that stage,"" Eric Stuart tells BBC Radio 5 Live. ""If the worst comes to worst, there's a small group of people who have what we call the 'red card', and it is literally a message to the stage manager that we need to cut the music, we need to stop. ""And then we need to engage the artist for him or her to speak to the crowd. Ideally, we don't want a guy or girl in the high-vis jacket or the police coming on stage and talking to the crowd. The artist is the best person to do that."" That seems to have happened during Friday's concert. The question for investigators will be why the music continued after the initial call for help. In his video statement, Scott said he was ""working closely with everyone to get to the bottom of this"" and described himself as ""honestly just devastated"". This video can not be played ""I'm honestly just devastated"" â Travis Scott posted this video on Instagram Steve Adelman, vice president and lead counsel for the Event Safety Alliance, urged against apportioning blame at this stage. ""There is the instinct to rush to judgment before we know what actually happened,""he told Rolling Stone magazine.,external Ancliffe hopes an inquiry will encourage promoters to ""tighten up their procedures or [concert] designs"". But Prof Still adds: ""If you look at any other safety-related industry - aviation, for example - if there's a near miss or a close call there's an investigation by experts, and new procedures are put into place to prevent that happening again. ""Unfortunately, in the events industry, it comes down to litigation and it's generally settled out of court. I know, because I'm an expert witness in a number of international cases. ""The court documents get sealed, the information never gets fed back into the industry and so there's no learning, there's no improvement.""

Workers who want flexible work roles missing out,"Some 19% of low paid jobs paying up to Â£20,000 full time equivalent mentioned part-time possibilities Three out of four jobs advertised in the UK still do not offer any kind of flexible work options, according to an annual survey of over five million ads. This is set against a backdrop of vacancies soaring to a20-year high of 1.1 millionbetween July and September. Flexible work consultancy, Timewise, tracked millions of ads for 17 words or phrases, such as job-share. From this analysis they found that the proportion of ads posted with a flexible component was just 26%. Over the last 19 months the coronavirus pandemic has delivered a seismic shake-up in many professions - flipping a large chunk of the workforce to remote-working overnight. Staff to get day-one right to ask for home working 'The way my boss monitored me at home was creepy' Should I be working from home or going back to the office? Around half of employees now work flexibly in some form, while nine in 10 people say they want flexibility in their next position. One of these jobseekers is Carole MacLeod, who before she had her daughter had a high-flying career as a consultant for a major UK telecoms provider. She managed C-suite executives at major events such as the World Economic Forum in Davos. Now in her fifties, she's finding it impossible to find similar level work. ""Now I cannot find a single good flexible job to apply for,"" she said. Managers are missing out on skilled workers by not offering flexible working says Carole MacLeod ""The market is flooded with jobs. But none that offer a decent wage, good enjoyable professional type work and flexibility too,"" she said. ""The kind of jobs that are available tend to be in hospitality, offering long poorly paid shifts that are below my skillset. Recruiters won't even answer the phone. I think I have applied for maybe one hundred jobs at various universities and academic institutions in central London. I find it bewildering."" How do I find a new job and who is hiring? Carole is not alone: there are many mid-career workers who, despite a recent surge in job adverts as Covid restrictions eased, still cannot find work that fits with their need for flexibility and level of experience. The work landscape has shifted but experts say the way roles are advertised suggest bosses have failed to adapt to find the best talent. ""Employers that don't include their flexible working offering within their job ads are making a huge mistake,"" said Professor Sir Cary Cooper, Organisational Psychologist at Alliance Manchester Business School. ""The hybrid model is what the majority of people want - and are currently practising."" The Timewise survey also revealed part-time work and low pay are still synonymous in the UK. Some 19% of the low paid jobs advertised -those paying up to Â£20,000 full time equivalent -mentioned part-time possibilities. The highest chunk of any salary band. Prof Cooper explained senior management may be making a conscious decision not to reference the term flexible working in any external communication ""because they fear potential employees will think that they have the automatic right to work remotely 24/7."" Employers need to think about attracting new talent using flexible working, says Timewise's Emma Stewart He points out however, that's not the reality for most workers. ""Most people are tired of working in this way. What they're looking for is a mix of being in the office and at home, so they can interact with other colleagues but also have the freedom to take time at home if they need it to juggle other life demands."" Emma Stewart, co-founder of Timewise tells employers to be as explicit as possible about what forms of 'flex' they can offer. For example, 'this role can be offered on a three-day week basis'. ""We know nearly half of job seekers click away from roles that say 'open to flexible working'. They seek out ads which reflect the kind of flexible pattern they are looking for. Just as you search for jobs within a set salary range,"" she said. Flexible working is also in demand by workers caring for older people Janine Bosak, professor of Organisational Psychology at Dublin City University Business School said there might be several reasons why employers remain hesitant to refer to flexible working in ads. For example, when someone starts a new job, employers might prefer they be physically present to learn the ropes and company culture. ""Employers might also be reluctant to mention flexible working in their advertising materials as it might be perceived as a right to flexible working, whereas it might not always be possible to accommodate a desire for flexible working,"" she added.

Tuesday's live coverage was brought to you by Jasmine Taylor-Coleman, James Clarke, Kelly-Leigh Cooper, Paul McLaren, George Bowden, Georgina Rannard and Dulcie Lee. A lot of talk at COP26 has focused on shifting away from global reliance on fossil fuels. The UK government thinks nuclear technology is part of the solution. The UK government'splan to reach ""net-zero"" emissions by 2050says nuclear power provides a ""reliable source of low-carbon electricity"". At the moment about 16% of Britain's electricity is provided by nuclear power from 15 reactors,according to the UK government,external. But it wants around a quarter of Britain's energy to come from nuclear by 2025. So how safe and green is nuclear and how much is it used around the world? Read more in our guide.

A number of British designers and fashion brands - including Mulberry and Burberry - have taken part in a special event for COP26. The Great Fashion for Climate Action show was held at the Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum in Glasgow on Tuesday. It aimed to showcase UK fashion innovation in the context of climate change. British designer Phoebe English was among those who took part. She tells the BBC News Channel the show showcased an array of solutions and ideas to help lessen the industry's burden on the environment. English says the process involves looking at fashion in a ""new light"" including valuing and using our clothes for longer. Designer Stella McCartney showed Prince Charles sustainable solutions last week Barack Obama delivered a personal thank-you message to US staff Barack Obama goes into fist-bump overdrive as he thanks US delegates and staff at COP26. The former US president delivered a personal message to them before heading home from Glasgow. He had focused his trip to Scotland onurging young people to ""stay angry""in the fight against climate change. During his speech to the summit on Monday, Obama said the world is ""nowhere near where we need to be"" to avoid a future climate catastrophe. One of the climate summit's most popular events took place last night - a huge quiz hosted by the organisation Carbon Brief. With 600 people attending virtually and online, it was a welcome break in the long days and nights at COP. And congratulations to the University of East Anglia who won for the second year running. But what really grabbed our attention is just how difficult the questions were. Prepare yourself to try to answer: ""If Paris = 21 and Berlin = 1, solve this equation: Doha/Milan = ?"".... No, we didn't get it either. The full quiz is onYouTube,externalshould you find yourself with several hours to spare..  We'll be bringing today's live coverage of the COP26 conference in Glasgow to a close in the next half hour. But first: a catch-up of Tuesday's main developments:  James FitzGeraldBBC Minute Gender and innovation have been todayâs top themes at
COP26. And nobody captures the spirit of the day quite like Vinisha Umashankar,
a 15-year-old inventor from southern India. She was the youngest finalist in the Duke of Cambridgeâs
recent Earthshot Prize for creative solutions to the worldâs problems. That was
thanks to her creation of a solar-powered cart that provides a mobile
clothes-ironing service without relying on traditional charcoal-burning.  This video can not be played India's ironing vendors use charcoal as fuel, but this cart harnesses the Sun's energy Itâs an effort to curb âair pollution, deforestation, respiratory diseases, and climate change,"" Vinisha told BBC Minute earlier in the conference. She says we can all do our bit to tackle these issues. âIf you look at climate change as a huge problem, then you get overwhelmed,â she explains. âBut when you think about it, it's these small problems that come together to cause climate change. If we just focus on solving these little problems, then climate change is much easier to look at."" She gave a speech to world leaders at COP26 last week, which she says was a combination of âfrustration and urgency, but also optimism.â âThey are definitely working the best they can, but sometimes itâs best to pick up the pace and speed things up, because we donât have much time left to take things at our own speed.â Sixteen people were arrested following a COP26 climate protest in Glasgow yesterday evening. Police say they initially ""facilitated a peaceful protest"" outside The Engine Works conference and dining venue in the Maryhill area of the city. But officers stepped in after some demonstrators from the Glasgow Calls Out Polluters group lay down in the road. A Police Scotland spokesman said: ""All of the 16 arrested were issued with a recorded police warning and released."" Two protesters have chained themselves together outside a bank Meanwhile, two protesters covered in fake blood have chained themselves together in a protest outside the offices of a bank in the centre of Glasgow. The area around St Vincent Street has been blocked and around 150 police officers are at the scene. Other protesters are holding banners calling for an end to deforestation. Fewer than 50 arrestswere made during the first week of COP26. Police have praised the majority of ""good natured"" protesters who have taken part in demos across Glasgow,including the estimated 100,000 marchers who took to the streets on Saturday. Megha MohanBBC Gender & Identity Correspondent Climate change dominates conversations for Kathy Jetnil-Kijiner, Hilda Heine and Peinum âThese conversations spill over to the dinner table. The other day my granddaughter Peinum asked about why water was coming over the seawallâ, Hilda Heine tells the BBC. She is a former president of the Marshall Islands, and also the first woman ever to lead an independent Pacific Islands nation. âWhen did she ask about that?â asks her daughter Kathy Jetnil-Kijiner, Peinumâs mother. âAbout two weeks ago,â Heine replies. âYes, she doesnât just ask questions, she grills me about climate change,â adds her daughter, a poet and Marshall Islands climate envoy for COP26. Home to just over 59,000 people, the Republic of the Marshall Islands comprises five isolated islands and 29 atolls. At their lowest points, the atolls sit just above sea level. Since 1993, sea levels in the Marshall Islands have risen by 7mm (0.3 inches) per year, double the global average, according to the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. By 2030, the islandsâ surrounding sea level is expected to rise by 9cm, drastically increasing the frequency and the impact of storm surges and coastal flooding. The mother-daughter team say they play to each otherâs strengths when fighting for their country. Stephen McDonellBBC News, China correspondent From late September, north-eastern China was hit by major
electricity shortages with some shops using candlelight to stay open, industries told to ration power and even global supply chains disrupted as
factories had to halt production. The roots of the power crisis are complex. Chinaâs economy came out of the Covid crisis earlier than
most countries, leading to a surge in international demand for goods made here.
This generated an unexpected increase in electricity use of about 10%. Because this came as something of a surprise to many
officials, there wasnât enough coal coming through to meet needs and the
country is still a long way off having enough non-coal fired power options to
turn to. Coal prices nearly doubled but consumer electricity prices
remained steady, as per government mandate. In this climate, producing more electricity meant companies losing money. So, as you might expect, they didnât want to increase output. Now, the pricing system in China is already being altered to better reflect market demand but these overall pressures have not been properly resolved. In the short-term, a solution was needed to get through this winter. The decision: increase coal production. More broadly, the Chinese government says coal-fired electricity will increase up until 2025 and only then be reduced as a proportion of power in the energy mix. Long-term, this country needs more renewable power and crucially, a much larger capacity to store it. Non-fossil fuel electricity (including nuclear and hydro) will hit 47.3% of installed capacity by the end of this year. It may sound like a lot but itâs not nearly enough for China to achieve its stated environmental protection ambitions. This video can not be played COP26: Barack Obama stops by at Strathclyde University Crowds have gathered to greet Barack Obama as he visited Strathclyde University for talks with COP26 youth leaders. The Obama Foundation roundtable event in Glasgow yesterday evening discussed how the current generation can lead the fight against climate change. Leaving the event, the former US president urged onlookers to ""get active"". Prof Sir Jim McDonald, the university principal, says the visit by such a ""global champion of social progress and equality"" is an honour for the entire Strathclyde community. The former US president visited Strathclyde University in Glasgow for talks with COP26 youth leaders. More reaction now to the new report that saysthe world is nowhere near its goals on limited global temperature rises- despite COP26 pledges. Dr Kat Kramer, climate policy lead for Christian Aid, describes the analysis as ""yet another screaming siren"". Ed Miliband, the UK's shadow business secretary, says the report is an ""important reality check on the government's attempt to greenwash Glasgow"". ""All countries urgently need to step up the ambition and to agree to revisit these issues well before 2025, otherwise the chance to limit global warming to 1.5C will slip irrevocably through our hands,"" he says. An Afghan climate campaigner has alleged his visa to attend COP26 is stuck in limbo after officials failed to clear it in time. Nasratullah Mateen has said he was officially invited to attend the summit in Glasgow - and would have been his country's only accredited delegate - but has since struggled to get a visa to fly into the UK. ""They failed me, and the voice of over 34 million people who are already severely affected by the climate crisis,"" he wrote on Twitter. We have contacted the Cop26 organisers for comment.

Alok Sharma said there was still a mountain to climb in negotiations President of COP26, Alok Sharma, says prediction reports about temperature rises demonstrate ""that there has been some progress but clearly not enough"". Analysis from Climate Action Trackerpublished this afternooncalculates the world is heading for 2.4C of warming, far more than the 1.5C limit nations have committed to. ""If we look at where we were heading before Paris (climate talks in 2015) the trajectory on some of the analysis suggested we were heading to 6C of global warming,"" he says. ""Post-Paris, those commitments were taking us to below 4C, and now I think you see various reports that suggest we've bent the curve towards 2C. ""But of course that isn't good enough,"" he adds. ""What we've always said is that we want at this COP to be able to say with credibility that we're keeping 1.5C alive, 1.5C within reach. ""And that is what we're going to be working towards over the coming days."" The governments of 22 countries and the European Commission have confirmed they will work together to invest in clean energy technologies to help reduce the carbon used by challenging industries. Four ""missions"" will help facilitate urban transitions, eliminate emissions from industry, enable CO2 removal and produce renewable fuels. They are part of Mission Innovation - which brings together governments from every
continent, international organisations, and private sector investors. The announcement has been described as a ""breakthrough"" and championed by US climate envoy John Kerry, who says it's ""accelerating innovation across challenging sectors and
technologies to enable a net-zero transition by mid-century"". Sir Patrick Vallance, the UK government's chief scientific advisor says: âReaching
global net zero by mid-century requires intense international collaboration on
research and innovation to develop and deliver solutions across all sectors of
the global economy."" He says Mission Innovation will provide an
important platform for the public and private sectors around the world to
work together over the next decade. Letâs turn now to US representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who has been speaking at a COP26 event on climate action. Ocasio-Cortez - often known simply by her initials AOC - is one of the most vocal voices in US politics advocating radical action on climate change. She begins her speech by declaring the US is âbackâ as a climate leader after the Trump administration - but says her partyâs approach is now âfundamentally differentâ to before. She explains they are moving away from âpure market-based solutionsâ to climate change that were around 10 years ago. Instead, she says, grassroots activists are now invited to help shape policy, citingthe Green New Deal- a radical plan to transform the economy and tackle climate change. She says it shows ""we can't just pursue decarbonisation"" - plans will have to benefit the working class, the vulnerable, frontline communities, people of colour, women and underserved communities. Justice and jobs must be the focus of any climate plans, she adds. âThatâs whatâs going to make it politically popular and where weâre going to mobilise our economy to meet these aggressive targets.â Environment group Greenpeace describes the new report from Climate Action Tracker we've been reporting on this afternoon as ""devastating"" and is urging governments to work with ""vigour for a deal to save our common future"" and ""turn this thing around"". Executive Director
Jennifer Morgan says the report - whichpredicts the world is on track for a 2.4C temperature rise despite recent pledges- is like a ""telescope trained on an asteroid heading for
Earth"". ""Weâve just been told what the future holds,"" she says of the report. ""Everybody knows what we need to
do to change it. No more excuses, timeâs up, our leaders need to deliver, and
now.â James FitzGeraldBBC Minute The Little Amal puppet is 3.5m tall More now on the appearance at COP26 from Little Amal - a not-so-little puppet depicting a
refugee girl from Syria. One of the puppeteers who has animated Amal during her 8,000km journey across Europe has told BBC Minute why todayâs appearance on Gender Day is
so meaningful. âShe can stand for
so much and be a beacon for so many things,â says Sebastian Charles, from Good
Chance Theatre. âItâs a really positive step in the right direction in terms of
equality.â Amal cannot communicate verbally but Sebastian says her silence speaks volumes. âRather than make political statements, sheâs able to just be in the room - and her presence alone sparks conversationsâ, he explains. âOne of them is climate change, which can be linked to the refugee crisis.â The 3.5m-tall character was made by War Horse creators The Handspring Puppet Company. Controlling Amal can be a challenge â and Seb is just one of a team of puppeteers today. âThereâs no book that you can dust off and read how to animate something like this,â he says. âItâs definitely something that you learn on the job.â Special Presidential Envoy for Climate, John Kerry, is among those representing the US at the COP26 summit. He's appeared today at a panel event organised by Bloomberg. Kerry describes Donald Trump's withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement as showing ""vindictive mischief"" without science or economic sense - something he says has hurt the US reputation abroad. Asked about the pledges made in Glasgow so far, he says he hopes the summit is building into something ""very significant"" but is also a ""test"" and a ""checkpoint"" on what was agreed in Paris. ""This COP is already different and better than any COP I've ever been to,"" he says of the conference. ""There is a greater sense of urgency, a greater sense of focus, a greater sense of possibilities."" But the envoy acknowledges there are still ""some issues"" to be worked out in the coming days. Asked if the progress being made is enough, Kerry says the US is still ""hopeful"" other nations - including China - can be brought into agreements made on methane. He also says it will be ""insanity"" not to closely measure the progress being made every year at future conferences in line with pledges. Â© 2025 BBC.

One of the climate summit's most popular events took place last night - a huge quiz hosted by the organisation Carbon Brief. With 600 people attending virtually and online, it was a welcome break in the long days and nights at COP. And congratulations to the University of East Anglia who won for the second year running. But what really grabbed our attention is just how difficult the questions were. Prepare yourself to try to answer: ""If Paris = 21 and Berlin = 1, solve this equation: Doha/Milan = ?"".... No, we didn't get it either. The full quiz is onYouTube,externalshould you find yourself with several hours to spare..  We'll be bringing today's live coverage of the COP26 conference in Glasgow to a close in the next half hour. But first: a catch-up of Tuesday's main developments:  James FitzGeraldBBC Minute Gender and innovation have been todayâs top themes at
COP26. And nobody captures the spirit of the day quite like Vinisha Umashankar,
a 15-year-old inventor from southern India. She was the youngest finalist in the Duke of Cambridgeâs
recent Earthshot Prize for creative solutions to the worldâs problems. That was
thanks to her creation of a solar-powered cart that provides a mobile
clothes-ironing service without relying on traditional charcoal-burning.  This video can not be played India's ironing vendors use charcoal as fuel, but this cart harnesses the Sun's energy Itâs an effort to curb âair pollution, deforestation, respiratory diseases, and climate change,"" Vinisha told BBC Minute earlier in the conference. She says we can all do our bit to tackle these issues. âIf you look at climate change as a huge problem, then you get overwhelmed,â she explains. âBut when you think about it, it's these small problems that come together to cause climate change. If we just focus on solving these little problems, then climate change is much easier to look at."" She gave a speech to world leaders at COP26 last week, which she says was a combination of âfrustration and urgency, but also optimism.â âThey are definitely working the best they can, but sometimes itâs best to pick up the pace and speed things up, because we donât have much time left to take things at our own speed.â Sixteen people were arrested following a COP26 climate protest in Glasgow yesterday evening. Police say they initially ""facilitated a peaceful protest"" outside The Engine Works conference and dining venue in the Maryhill area of the city. But officers stepped in after some demonstrators from the Glasgow Calls Out Polluters group lay down in the road. A Police Scotland spokesman said: ""All of the 16 arrested were issued with a recorded police warning and released."" Two protesters have chained themselves together outside a bank Meanwhile, two protesters covered in fake blood have chained themselves together in a protest outside the offices of a bank in the centre of Glasgow. The area around St Vincent Street has been blocked and around 150 police officers are at the scene. Other protesters are holding banners calling for an end to deforestation. Fewer than 50 arrestswere made during the first week of COP26. Police have praised the majority of ""good natured"" protesters who have taken part in demos across Glasgow,including the estimated 100,000 marchers who took to the streets on Saturday. Megha MohanBBC Gender & Identity Correspondent Climate change dominates conversations for Kathy Jetnil-Kijiner, Hilda Heine and Peinum âThese conversations spill over to the dinner table. The other day my granddaughter Peinum asked about why water was coming over the seawallâ, Hilda Heine tells the BBC. She is a former president of the Marshall Islands, and also the first woman ever to lead an independent Pacific Islands nation. âWhen did she ask about that?â asks her daughter Kathy Jetnil-Kijiner, Peinumâs mother. âAbout two weeks ago,â Heine replies. âYes, she doesnât just ask questions, she grills me about climate change,â adds her daughter, a poet and Marshall Islands climate envoy for COP26. Home to just over 59,000 people, the Republic of the Marshall Islands comprises five isolated islands and 29 atolls. At their lowest points, the atolls sit just above sea level. Since 1993, sea levels in the Marshall Islands have risen by 7mm (0.3 inches) per year, double the global average, according to the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. By 2030, the islandsâ surrounding sea level is expected to rise by 9cm, drastically increasing the frequency and the impact of storm surges and coastal flooding. The mother-daughter team say they play to each otherâs strengths when fighting for their country. Stephen McDonellBBC News, China correspondent From late September, north-eastern China was hit by major
electricity shortages with some shops using candlelight to stay open, industries told to ration power and even global supply chains disrupted as
factories had to halt production. The roots of the power crisis are complex. Chinaâs economy came out of the Covid crisis earlier than
most countries, leading to a surge in international demand for goods made here.
This generated an unexpected increase in electricity use of about 10%. Because this came as something of a surprise to many
officials, there wasnât enough coal coming through to meet needs and the
country is still a long way off having enough non-coal fired power options to
turn to. Coal prices nearly doubled but consumer electricity prices
remained steady, as per government mandate. In this climate, producing more electricity meant companies losing money. So, as you might expect, they didnât want to increase output. Now, the pricing system in China is already being altered to better reflect market demand but these overall pressures have not been properly resolved. In the short-term, a solution was needed to get through this winter. The decision: increase coal production. More broadly, the Chinese government says coal-fired electricity will increase up until 2025 and only then be reduced as a proportion of power in the energy mix. Long-term, this country needs more renewable power and crucially, a much larger capacity to store it. Non-fossil fuel electricity (including nuclear and hydro) will hit 47.3% of installed capacity by the end of this year. It may sound like a lot but itâs not nearly enough for China to achieve its stated environmental protection ambitions. This video can not be played COP26: Barack Obama stops by at Strathclyde University Crowds have gathered to greet Barack Obama as he visited Strathclyde University for talks with COP26 youth leaders. The Obama Foundation roundtable event in Glasgow yesterday evening discussed how the current generation can lead the fight against climate change. Leaving the event, the former US president urged onlookers to ""get active"". Prof Sir Jim McDonald, the university principal, says the visit by such a ""global champion of social progress and equality"" is an honour for the entire Strathclyde community. The former US president visited Strathclyde University in Glasgow for talks with COP26 youth leaders. More reaction now to the new report that saysthe world is nowhere near its goals on limited global temperature rises- despite COP26 pledges. Dr Kat Kramer, climate policy lead for Christian Aid, describes the analysis as ""yet another screaming siren"". Ed Miliband, the UK's shadow business secretary, says the report is an ""important reality check on the government's attempt to greenwash Glasgow"". ""All countries urgently need to step up the ambition and to agree to revisit these issues well before 2025, otherwise the chance to limit global warming to 1.5C will slip irrevocably through our hands,"" he says. An Afghan climate campaigner has alleged his visa to attend COP26 is stuck in limbo after officials failed to clear it in time. Nasratullah Mateen has said he was officially invited to attend the summit in Glasgow - and would have been his country's only accredited delegate - but has since struggled to get a visa to fly into the UK. ""They failed me, and the voice of over 34 million people who are already severely affected by the climate crisis,"" he wrote on Twitter. We have contacted the Cop26 organisers for comment.

Alok Sharma said there was still a mountain to climb in negotiations President of COP26, Alok Sharma, says prediction reports about temperature rises demonstrate ""that there has been some progress but clearly not enough"". Analysis from Climate Action Trackerpublished this afternooncalculates the world is heading for 2.4C of warming, far more than the 1.5C limit nations have committed to. ""If we look at where we were heading before Paris (climate talks in 2015) the trajectory on some of the analysis suggested we were heading to 6C of global warming,"" he says. ""Post-Paris, those commitments were taking us to below 4C, and now I think you see various reports that suggest we've bent the curve towards 2C. ""But of course that isn't good enough,"" he adds. ""What we've always said is that we want at this COP to be able to say with credibility that we're keeping 1.5C alive, 1.5C within reach. ""And that is what we're going to be working towards over the coming days."" The governments of 22 countries and the European Commission have confirmed they will work together to invest in clean energy technologies to help reduce the carbon used by challenging industries. Four ""missions"" will help facilitate urban transitions, eliminate emissions from industry, enable CO2 removal and produce renewable fuels. They are part of Mission Innovation - which brings together governments from every
continent, international organisations, and private sector investors. The announcement has been described as a ""breakthrough"" and championed by US climate envoy John Kerry, who says it's ""accelerating innovation across challenging sectors and
technologies to enable a net-zero transition by mid-century"". Sir Patrick Vallance, the UK government's chief scientific advisor says: âReaching
global net zero by mid-century requires intense international collaboration on
research and innovation to develop and deliver solutions across all sectors of
the global economy."" He says Mission Innovation will provide an
important platform for the public and private sectors around the world to
work together over the next decade. Letâs turn now to US representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who has been speaking at a COP26 event on climate action. Ocasio-Cortez - often known simply by her initials AOC - is one of the most vocal voices in US politics advocating radical action on climate change. She begins her speech by declaring the US is âbackâ as a climate leader after the Trump administration - but says her partyâs approach is now âfundamentally differentâ to before. She explains they are moving away from âpure market-based solutionsâ to climate change that were around 10 years ago. Instead, she says, grassroots activists are now invited to help shape policy, citingthe Green New Deal- a radical plan to transform the economy and tackle climate change. She says it shows ""we can't just pursue decarbonisation"" - plans will have to benefit the working class, the vulnerable, frontline communities, people of colour, women and underserved communities. Justice and jobs must be the focus of any climate plans, she adds. âThatâs whatâs going to make it politically popular and where weâre going to mobilise our economy to meet these aggressive targets.â Environment group Greenpeace describes the new report from Climate Action Tracker we've been reporting on this afternoon as ""devastating"" and is urging governments to work with ""vigour for a deal to save our common future"" and ""turn this thing around"". Executive Director
Jennifer Morgan says the report - whichpredicts the world is on track for a 2.4C temperature rise despite recent pledges- is like a ""telescope trained on an asteroid heading for
Earth"". ""Weâve just been told what the future holds,"" she says of the report. ""Everybody knows what we need to
do to change it. No more excuses, timeâs up, our leaders need to deliver, and
now.â James FitzGeraldBBC Minute The Little Amal puppet is 3.5m tall More now on the appearance at COP26 from Little Amal - a not-so-little puppet depicting a
refugee girl from Syria. One of the puppeteers who has animated Amal during her 8,000km journey across Europe has told BBC Minute why todayâs appearance on Gender Day is
so meaningful. âShe can stand for
so much and be a beacon for so many things,â says Sebastian Charles, from Good
Chance Theatre. âItâs a really positive step in the right direction in terms of
equality.â Amal cannot communicate verbally but Sebastian says her silence speaks volumes. âRather than make political statements, sheâs able to just be in the room - and her presence alone sparks conversationsâ, he explains. âOne of them is climate change, which can be linked to the refugee crisis.â The 3.5m-tall character was made by War Horse creators The Handspring Puppet Company. Controlling Amal can be a challenge â and Seb is just one of a team of puppeteers today. âThereâs no book that you can dust off and read how to animate something like this,â he says. âItâs definitely something that you learn on the job.â Special Presidential Envoy for Climate, John Kerry, is among those representing the US at the COP26 summit. He's appeared today at a panel event organised by Bloomberg. Kerry describes Donald Trump's withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement as showing ""vindictive mischief"" without science or economic sense - something he says has hurt the US reputation abroad. Asked about the pledges made in Glasgow so far, he says he hopes the summit is building into something ""very significant"" but is also a ""test"" and a ""checkpoint"" on what was agreed in Paris. ""This COP is already different and better than any COP I've ever been to,"" he says of the conference. ""There is a greater sense of urgency, a greater sense of focus, a greater sense of possibilities."" But the envoy acknowledges there are still ""some issues"" to be worked out in the coming days. Asked if the progress being made is enough, Kerry says the US is still ""hopeful"" other nations - including China - can be brought into agreements made on methane. He also says it will be ""insanity"" not to closely measure the progress being made every year at future conferences in line with pledges. Â© 2025 BBC.

Primark says stock woes could persist until 2023,"The snuddie is Primark's latest trendy item of loungewear Discount fashion chain Primark has said it could face disruption from global supply chain issues into 2023, but it assured customers that ""we are getting the goods we need"". Chief executive George Weston told the BBC that Primark shops would be properly stocked for Christmas. The chain had prioritised seasonal items, he said. ""We do not see any crisis developing as we look forward - it's just more difficult,"" he added. Store closures during Covid lockdowns hit the retailer's annual sales, down by 12% on pre-Covid levels. Its parent firm, AB Foods, said Primark had lost one-third of its trading days in the 53 weeks to 18 September. But it added that it expected higher profits in the new financial year. Mr Weston said that despite difficulties with clogged ports and the UK's shortage of lorry drivers, the ""vast majority"" of items stocked by Primark were still available, subject to some minor gaps. ""Your size in basic T-shirts might not be available on a certain day, but it might be the next day,"" he said. In its latest results, Primark also announced big expansion plans, with new stores due to open in the US, France, Italy and Spain. Overall, it said its total store numbers would grow from 398 to 530 over the next five years, with the number of US outlets set to rise from 13 to 60. Mr Weston said Primark was now established in the US, adding: ""It's no longer a punt - it's a rollout of a business we understand, to customers we know well."" Despite the negative impact of the pandemic, Primark has found that some habits that became established under lockdown are working to its advantage. For its autumn and winter range, the retailer said it was capitalising on the continued trend for ""comfort living"" and loungewear with the launch of what it called the ""snuddie"" - a ""snuggly oversized hoodie"", designed for ""those lazy days when your comfiest clothes just don't cut it"". Primark said the snuddie was ""attracting a strong response from customers across all markets"", with best-selling versions including an avocado print for men and a Minnie Mouse design for children. Unlike most High Street retailers, Primark has no online retail operations. It plans to overhaul its website early next year to give more details of in-store ranges, so customers can ""browse online, before they come into our stores"". Despite its digital revamp, Mr Weston said Primark still had no plans to allow shoppers to order its products for home delivery. ""We've never said never to things like click-and-collect, but we're first and foremost a bricks-and-mortar retailer and we will remain very profitable as that,"" he added. AB Foods said its adjusted pre-tax profits had fallen by 1% to Â£908m for the year, with the dip in sales at Primark offset by ""strong"" sales in its food business. The firm's chairman, Michael McLintock, said sales and profit were again below pre-Covid levels, but praised the ""agility"" of Primark's management in responding to ""the fast-changing and wide range of trading restrictions applied to our stores over the year"". ""The strength of Primark's sales after the reopening of all our stores in the spring demonstrated the relevance and appeal of our value-for-money offering,"" he added. Mr McLintock said AB Foods - which, as well as running Primark, also owns food brands such as Twinings, Ovaltine and Patak's - was seeing ""significant cost increases in energy, logistics and commodities, in addition to the impact of widely reported port congestion and road freight limitations"". ""Primark is not immune to the challenges of supply chain, raw material cost and labour rate inflation,"" he said. ""Our businesses are working to offset the impact of these through cost savings. Where necessary, our food businesses will also implement price increases,"" he added. When asked if these cost savings could lead to job losses, Mr Weston said: ""No, we're recruiting staff, not cutting."" However, he added that Primark saw opportunities to make existing workers more productive, giving the example of how it had automated a warehouse in the Netherlands while keeping staff levels the same. The pandemic has proved costly for Primark. It lost Â£2bn in sales last year when its stores had to close. A third of its trading days were lost. But it's weathered the storm. All things being equal, it now hopes to more than make up the lost ground, assuming trading comes back to normal next year. And it has big plans for international expansion, with new stores in the US, France, Italy and Spain over the next five years. But Primark's having to paddle hard to mitigate all the cost pressures now building up. Although AB Foods' food business is putting prices up where necessary, passing costs on to shoppers is less easy to do at its fast-fashion chain. Primark says thanks to the weaker dollar and the steps it's taken to lower store costs, it hopes to broadly offset all the rising supply chain costs and inflationary pressures bearing down on the industry. Mr Weston said Primark had ""delivered a good performance in the face of continued disruption to trading caused by the pandemic"". ""Although the possibility of further trading restrictions cannot be ruled out, we expect Primark to deliver a much-improved margin and profit next year,"" he added. AB Foods' share price rose by 6% to Â£19.67 on Tuesday.

Senedd set to back cinema and theatre covid passesCovid passes are set to be extended to cinemas and theatres after Plaid backed the plans.Wales politicsComments,"Anyone aged over 16 will have to show a Covid pass to get into a cinema or theatre under the new rules People going to cinemas and theatres in Wales will be required to show a Covid pass after the Welsh government won a vote in the Senedd. Currently, visitors to nightclubs and large events have to show they are fully vaccinated, have tested negative for Covid or have recently had the virus to enter. From Monday, it will be extended to cinemas, theatres and concert halls. Labour ministers won the vote after Plaid Cymru backed the plans. Anyone aged over 16 in Wales canget an NHS Covid pass,externalif they are fully vaccinated or have had a negative lateral flow test in the previous 48 hours. The new law passed with 39Members of the Seneddvoting for and 15 against, with the Welsh Conservatives and Liberal Democrat Jane Dodds opposed. What is a Covid pass and how do I get one? First day of Covid passes in Wales Covid passes introduced in Welsh sport On Tuesday night, Big Brother Watch, a civil liberties campaign, said it was starting legal proceedings against the Welsh government, calling the scheme ""authoritarian, invasive and unevidenced"". But Labour said the Covid pass was popular and Health Minister Eluned Morgan said the extension was designed to keep cinemas and theatres open over the winter months. Hundreds of protesters gathered on the Senedd steps in Cardiff Bay on Tuesday, amid concerns the passes unreasonably restrict personal freedom. The vote was in contrast to October when ministers won the first Covid pass decisionby a single vote when one Conservative MS was unable to log on to Zoom to vote remotely. At the time the Welsh government - which holds exactly half of the 60 seats in the Senedd - had faced defeat with the whole opposition, including Plaid, against the plans. Steve Reynolds said he felt cinemas and theatres were being ""singled out"" The planned extension had divided opinion among those working in cinemas and theatres. Cardiff Bay's Wales Millennium Centre said it welcomed any moves that would ensure the safety of its audiences and allow it to remain open, particularly before Christmas. Steve Reynolds, director of Picturedrome Cinemas, which runs Maxime cinema in Blackwood, said he felt cinemas and theatres were being ""singled out"". He worried about the impact it could have on the trade: ""Cinemas won't survive if they have a dramatic fall in business"". Public Health Wales gives the latest seven day average Covid case rate as 527.7 per 100,000 people. But Ms Morgan told a Senedd debate the case rate was still ""very high"" and has been increasing in some areas. ""Our aim is to avoid having to close sectors or reintroduce restrictions,"" she said, claiming ""the vast majority of the Welsh public are with us"". Conservative constitutional spokesman Darren Millar said there were ""many ethical and equality issues with Covid passes"", repeating concerns that results from lateral flow devices are self-declared. ""You can swab your dog and put its result in that system and still get your vaccine passport to be able to attend any event, nightclub, cinema theatre or anywhere else, it is ridiculous."" Covid passes are already required for nightclubs and large events Plaid health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth indicated last week the party was likely to back the extension, but its stance was not confirmed until Tuesday lunchtime. He said: ""Plaid Cymru has made it clear throughout this pandemic that we'll support evidence-based actions that can help limit transmission and keep the people of Wales safe. ""After examining the evidence, including that provided by the Welsh government, we are willing to support extending the passes to help mitigate the transmission of Covid."" Welsh Liberal Democrat leader Ms Dodds said her opposition was ""foremost"" about ""the lack of evidence"". She told the Senedd she had still not received any evidence that the passes ""work to reduce transmission or to improve the uptake of the vaccine"". The vote took place as the Labour government continues tonegotiates a co-operation deal with Plaidin Cardiff Bay. The parties have been discussing working together for months, as Labour lacks an outright majority, but they are not expected to enter a formal coalition. Nightlife industry group NTIA, which has opposed the Covid pass scheme from the start, said cinemas and theatres would experience ""significant challenges"". Chief executive Michael Kill added: ""There is a huge concern throughout the hospitality and night time economy sectors that Welsh government will take this even further to encompass more businesses, which without a doubt will cripple the industries involved.""

Rolls-Royce gets backing for mini nuclear reactorsPrivate investors and the UK government will help fund the firm's development of small nuclear reactors.BusinessComments,"Rolls-Royce has been backed by a consortium of private investors and the UK government to develop small nuclear reactors to generate cleaner energy. The creation of the Rolls-Royce Small Modular Reactor (SMR) business was announced following a Â£195m cash injection from private firms and a Â£210m grant from the government. It is hoped the new company could create up to 40,000 jobs by 2050. However, critics say the focus should be on renewable power, not new nuclear. Currently, about 16% of UK electricity generation comes from nuclear power. Small modular reactors are nuclear fission reactors but are smaller than conventional ones. The investment by Rolls-Royce Group, BNF Resources, Exelon Generation and the government will go towards developing Rolls-Royce's SMR design and take it through regulatory processes to assess whether it is suitable to be deployed in the UK. It will also identify sites which will manufacture the reactors' parts and most of the venture's investment is expected to be focused in the north of the UK, where there is existing nuclear expertise. Rolls-Royce's share price jumped by 4.2% to 147.85p each following the announcement. Rolls-Royce SMR said one of its power stations would occupy about one tenth of the size of a conventional nuclear plant - the equivalent footprint of two football pitches - and power approximately one million homes. The firm said a plant would have the capacity to generate 470MW of power, which it added would be the same produced by more than 150 onshore wind turbines. Warren East, Rolls-Royce chief executive, said the company's SMR technology offered a ""clean energy solution"" which help tackle climate change. Business and Energy Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said SMRs offered opportunities to ""cut costs and build more quickly, ensuring we can bring clean electricity to people's homes and cut our already-dwindling use of volatile fossil fuels even further"". ""This is a once in a lifetime opportunity for the UK to deploy more low carbon energy than ever before and ensure greater energy independence"", he added. SMRs are thought to be less expensive to build than traditional nuclear power plants because of their smaller size. Due to the nature of Rolls-Royce's reactors, it is understood parts could be produced in factories and transported to sites by road, which would reduce construction time and costs. At an expected cost of around Â£2bn each, SMRs would cost less than the Â£20bn each for the larger plant under construction at Hinkley Point and an anticipated, but not yet approved, sister plant at Sizewell in Suffolk. If approved for use in the UK, it is understood Rolls-Royce SMR could build up to 16 reactors across the UK for electricity production. Tom Samson, chief executive Rolls-Royce SMR, said the company had been established to ""deliver a low cost, deployable, scalable and investable programme of new nuclear power plants"". ""Our transformative approach to delivering nuclear power, based on predictable factory-built components, is unique and the nuclear technology is proven,"" he added. What does net zero mean? UK sets out net zero plans for greenhouse gases However, Paul Dorfman, chairman of the Nuclear Consulting Group think tank, told the BBC's Today programme there was danger that the money spent on nuclear power would hit funding for other power sources. ""If nuclear eats all the pies which it is looking to be doingâ¦ we won't have enough money to do the kind of things we need to do which we know practically and technologically we can do now,"" he said. Greenpeace's chief scientist Dr Doug Parr said SMRs were still more expensive than renewable technologies and added there was ""still no solution to dispose of the radioactive waste they leave behind and no consensus on where they should be located"". ""What's worse, there's not even a prototype in prospect anytime soon,"" he added. ""The immediate deadline for action is sharp cuts in emissions by 2030, and small reactors will have no role in that."" Friends of the Earth's head of policy, Mike Childs, said government support should be ""aimed at developing the UK's substantial renewable resources, such as offshore wind, tidal and solar, and boosting measures to help householders cut energy waste"". As part of a ""10-point plan"" to dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions to reach a target of net zero by 2050, the government has said nuclear power provides a ""reliable source of low-carbon electricity"" and that it is""pursuing large-scale nuclear"", while also looking to invest in SMRs.,external Tony Danker, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, said the investment for Rolls-Royce was a ""hugely promising milestone for a technology that can not only boost the economy but help deliver a greener and more secure energy system overall"". Meanwhile, Tom Greatrex, chief executive of the Nuclear Industry Association, added the funding sent a ""huge signal to private investors that the government wants SMRs alongside new large-scale stations to hit net zero"".

Primark admits struggles with rising costs,"The snuddie is Primark's latest trendy item of loungewear Discount fashion chain Primark has said it could face disruption from global supply chain issues into 2023, but it assured customers that ""we are getting the goods we need"". Chief executive George Weston told the BBC that Primark shops would be properly stocked for Christmas. The chain had prioritised seasonal items, he said. ""We do not see any crisis developing as we look forward - it's just more difficult,"" he added. Store closures during Covid lockdowns hit the retailer's annual sales, down by 12% on pre-Covid levels. Its parent firm, AB Foods, said Primark had lost one-third of its trading days in the 53 weeks to 18 September. But it added that it expected higher profits in the new financial year. Mr Weston said that despite difficulties with clogged ports and the UK's shortage of lorry drivers, the ""vast majority"" of items stocked by Primark were still available, subject to some minor gaps. ""Your size in basic T-shirts might not be available on a certain day, but it might be the next day,"" he said. In its latest results, Primark also announced big expansion plans, with new stores due to open in the US, France, Italy and Spain. Overall, it said its total store numbers would grow from 398 to 530 over the next five years, with the number of US outlets set to rise from 13 to 60. Mr Weston said Primark was now established in the US, adding: ""It's no longer a punt - it's a rollout of a business we understand, to customers we know well."" Despite the negative impact of the pandemic, Primark has found that some habits that became established under lockdown are working to its advantage. For its autumn and winter range, the retailer said it was capitalising on the continued trend for ""comfort living"" and loungewear with the launch of what it called the ""snuddie"" - a ""snuggly oversized hoodie"", designed for ""those lazy days when your comfiest clothes just don't cut it"". Primark said the snuddie was ""attracting a strong response from customers across all markets"", with best-selling versions including an avocado print for men and a Minnie Mouse design for children. Unlike most High Street retailers, Primark has no online retail operations. It plans to overhaul its website early next year to give more details of in-store ranges, so customers can ""browse online, before they come into our stores"". Despite its digital revamp, Mr Weston said Primark still had no plans to allow shoppers to order its products for home delivery. ""We've never said never to things like click-and-collect, but we're first and foremost a bricks-and-mortar retailer and we will remain very profitable as that,"" he added. AB Foods said its adjusted pre-tax profits had fallen by 1% to Â£908m for the year, with the dip in sales at Primark offset by ""strong"" sales in its food business. The firm's chairman, Michael McLintock, said sales and profit were again below pre-Covid levels, but praised the ""agility"" of Primark's management in responding to ""the fast-changing and wide range of trading restrictions applied to our stores over the year"". ""The strength of Primark's sales after the reopening of all our stores in the spring demonstrated the relevance and appeal of our value-for-money offering,"" he added. Mr McLintock said AB Foods - which, as well as running Primark, also owns food brands such as Twinings, Ovaltine and Patak's - was seeing ""significant cost increases in energy, logistics and commodities, in addition to the impact of widely reported port congestion and road freight limitations"". ""Primark is not immune to the challenges of supply chain, raw material cost and labour rate inflation,"" he said. ""Our businesses are working to offset the impact of these through cost savings. Where necessary, our food businesses will also implement price increases,"" he added. When asked if these cost savings could lead to job losses, Mr Weston said: ""No, we're recruiting staff, not cutting."" However, he added that Primark saw opportunities to make existing workers more productive, giving the example of how it had automated a warehouse in the Netherlands while keeping staff levels the same. The pandemic has proved costly for Primark. It lost Â£2bn in sales last year when its stores had to close. A third of its trading days were lost. But it's weathered the storm. All things being equal, it now hopes to more than make up the lost ground, assuming trading comes back to normal next year. And it has big plans for international expansion, with new stores in the US, France, Italy and Spain over the next five years. But Primark's having to paddle hard to mitigate all the cost pressures now building up. Although AB Foods' food business is putting prices up where necessary, passing costs on to shoppers is less easy to do at its fast-fashion chain. Primark says thanks to the weaker dollar and the steps it's taken to lower store costs, it hopes to broadly offset all the rising supply chain costs and inflationary pressures bearing down on the industry. Mr Weston said Primark had ""delivered a good performance in the face of continued disruption to trading caused by the pandemic"". ""Although the possibility of further trading restrictions cannot be ruled out, we expect Primark to deliver a much-improved margin and profit next year,"" he added.

Covid passes for cinema and theatre face key vote,"Anyone aged over 16 will have to show a Covid pass to get into a cinema or theatre under the new rules People going to cinemas and theatres in Wales will be required to show a Covid pass after the Welsh government won a vote in the Senedd. Currently, visitors to nightclubs and large events have to show they are fully vaccinated, have tested negative for Covid or have recently had the virus to enter. From Monday, it will be extended to cinemas, theatres and concert halls. Labour ministers won the vote after Plaid Cymru backed the plans. Anyone aged over 16 in Wales canget an NHS Covid pass,externalif they are fully vaccinated or have had a negative lateral flow test in the previous 48 hours. The new law passed with 39Members of the Seneddvoting for and 15 against, with the Welsh Conservatives and Liberal Democrat Jane Dodds opposed. What is a Covid pass and how do I get one? First day of Covid passes in Wales Covid passes introduced in Welsh sport On Tuesday night, Big Brother Watch, a civil liberties campaign, said it was starting legal proceedings against the Welsh government, calling the scheme ""authoritarian, invasive and unevidenced"". But Labour said the Covid pass was popular and Health Minister Eluned Morgan said the extension was designed to keep cinemas and theatres open over the winter months. Hundreds of protesters gathered on the Senedd steps in Cardiff Bay on Tuesday, amid concerns the passes unreasonably restrict personal freedom. The vote was in contrast to October when ministers won the first Covid pass decisionby a single vote when one Conservative MS was unable to log on to Zoom to vote remotely. At the time the Welsh government - which holds exactly half of the 60 seats in the Senedd - had faced defeat with the whole opposition, including Plaid, against the plans. Steve Reynolds said he felt cinemas and theatres were being ""singled out"" The planned extension had divided opinion among those working in cinemas and theatres. Cardiff Bay's Wales Millennium Centre said it welcomed any moves that would ensure the safety of its audiences and allow it to remain open, particularly before Christmas. Steve Reynolds, director of Picturedrome Cinemas, which runs Maxime cinema in Blackwood, said he felt cinemas and theatres were being ""singled out"". He worried about the impact it could have on the trade: ""Cinemas won't survive if they have a dramatic fall in business"". Public Health Wales gives the latest seven day average Covid case rate as 527.7 per 100,000 people. But Ms Morgan told a Senedd debate the case rate was still ""very high"" and has been increasing in some areas. ""Our aim is to avoid having to close sectors or reintroduce restrictions,"" she said, claiming ""the vast majority of the Welsh public are with us"". Conservative constitutional spokesman Darren Millar said there were ""many ethical and equality issues with Covid passes"", repeating concerns that results from lateral flow devices are self-declared. ""You can swab your dog and put its result in that system and still get your vaccine passport to be able to attend any event, nightclub, cinema theatre or anywhere else, it is ridiculous."" Covid passes are already required for nightclubs and large events Plaid health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth indicated last week the party was likely to back the extension, but its stance was not confirmed until Tuesday lunchtime. He said: ""Plaid Cymru has made it clear throughout this pandemic that we'll support evidence-based actions that can help limit transmission and keep the people of Wales safe. ""After examining the evidence, including that provided by the Welsh government, we are willing to support extending the passes to help mitigate the transmission of Covid."" Welsh Liberal Democrat leader Ms Dodds said her opposition was ""foremost"" about ""the lack of evidence"". She told the Senedd she had still not received any evidence that the passes ""work to reduce transmission or to improve the uptake of the vaccine"". The vote took place as the Labour government continues tonegotiates a co-operation deal with Plaidin Cardiff Bay. The parties have been discussing working together for months, as Labour lacks an outright majority, but they are not expected to enter a formal coalition. Nightlife industry group NTIA, which has opposed the Covid pass scheme from the start, said cinemas and theatres would experience ""significant challenges"". Chief executive Michael Kill added: ""There is a huge concern throughout the hospitality and night time economy sectors that Welsh government will take this even further to encompass more businesses, which without a doubt will cripple the industries involved.""

Primark admits to post-pandemic cost pressures,"The snuddie is Primark's latest trendy item of loungewear Discount fashion chain Primark has said it could face disruption from global supply chain issues into 2023, but it assured customers that ""we are getting the goods we need"". Chief executive George Weston told the BBC that Primark shops would be properly stocked for Christmas. The chain had prioritised seasonal items, he said. ""We do not see any crisis developing as we look forward - it's just more difficult,"" he added. Store closures during Covid lockdowns hit the retailer's annual sales, down by 12% on pre-Covid levels. Its parent firm, AB Foods, said Primark had lost one-third of its trading days in the 53 weeks to 18 September. But it added that it expected higher profits in the new financial year. Mr Weston said that despite difficulties with clogged ports and the UK's shortage of lorry drivers, the ""vast majority"" of items stocked by Primark were still available, subject to some minor gaps. ""Your size in basic T-shirts might not be available on a certain day, but it might be the next day,"" he said. In its latest results, Primark also announced big expansion plans, with new stores due to open in the US, France, Italy and Spain. Overall, it said its total store numbers would grow from 398 to 530 over the next five years, with the number of US outlets set to rise from 13 to 60. Mr Weston said Primark was now established in the US, adding: ""It's no longer a punt - it's a rollout of a business we understand, to customers we know well."" Despite the negative impact of the pandemic, Primark has found that some habits that became established under lockdown are working to its advantage. For its autumn and winter range, the retailer said it was capitalising on the continued trend for ""comfort living"" and loungewear with the launch of what it called the ""snuddie"" - a ""snuggly oversized hoodie"", designed for ""those lazy days when your comfiest clothes just don't cut it"". Primark said the snuddie was ""attracting a strong response from customers across all markets"", with best-selling versions including an avocado print for men and a Minnie Mouse design for children. Unlike most High Street retailers, Primark has no online retail operations. It plans to overhaul its website early next year to give more details of in-store ranges, so customers can ""browse online, before they come into our stores"". Despite its digital revamp, Mr Weston said Primark still had no plans to allow shoppers to order its products for home delivery. ""We've never said never to things like click-and-collect, but we're first and foremost a bricks-and-mortar retailer and we will remain very profitable as that,"" he added.

"Yorkshire investigating new racism allegationA former Yorkshire academy player says he was racially abused by a member of staff as a 16-year-old, in the latest allegation of racism against the club.BBC Sport","This video can not be played Rafiq's 'courage' prompted other players to speak out about racism A former Yorkshire academy player says he was racially abused by a member of staff as a 16-year-old, in the latest allegation of racism against the club. Irfan Amjad, who was later released, claims a member of staff used a term referencing his Pakistani heritage to criticise his batting style. Yorkshire County Cricket Club said in a statement: ""It is essential that those who have experienced racism, discrimination and abuse are able to come forward to share their experiences. ""We were unaware of this allegation until now but will investigate appropriately."" Amjad's decision to speak to the BBC follows Azeem Rafiq's detailing of his experiences at Yorkshire, which he first discussed publicly in September 2020, and which left him close to taking his own life. A report found former Yorkshire player Rafiq was a victim of ""racial harassment and bullying"" but the club saidit would not discipline anyone. Yorkshire's handling of the issues raised by Rafiq was widely criticised - and on 1 November, ESPN reported that the racist term about Rafiq's Pakistani heritage was regularly used towards him, but the investigation concluded it was ""friendly and good-natured banter"". On Friday, chairman Roger Hutton resigned and on Monday, Lord Patel took over, praising Rafiq's ""bravery"" as a whistleblower. Last week,Yorkshire launched another investigationafter another - anonymous - former player alleged he was subjected to repeated racist abuse at the club. Yorkshire cricket racism scandal - how we got here Rafiq should be 'praised' for bravery, says Yorkshire chair Patel No-one at Yorkshire 'racist' but culture 'locked in the past' - Hutton Recounting his alleged experiences, Amjad said: ""On one occasion, we were playing a home game and I had played an attacking shot while batting, the ball went up in the air and I got caught out. ""I was making my way to the dressing room and as I got in, when I started taking my helmet and pads off, the individual came marching through the door and he looked me dead in the eyes."" At this point, the individual used the racist term in reference to ""a typical shot"" played by those of Pakistani heritage. Amjad added: ""And he just left. I was stunned, didn't know what to do and was shocked. I had never been directly racially insulted like that to my face. I didn't know what to do. ""Even before the incident I felt distant, it happened and then I felt isolated after that. Going forwards, I didn't feel I could speak up or give my views on the game in team meetings. ""It crosses your mind [reporting it] but I was a 16-year-old boy and I didn't know what to do. I kept it to myself. ""No-one else shared their experiences with me and I didn't share mine either. If I did open up, those that did experience similar issues may have opened up too."" It is the latest allegation of racism to come to light at Yorkshire following the detailing of Rafiq's story. Ex-Pakistan seamerRana Naved-ul-Hasanwas the second player to allege racism at Yorkshire, saying ""systematic taunting"" occurred at the club. Last Friday, Yorkshire chairmanRoger Huttonwas one of several board members to resign over the club's response to racism experienced by Rafiq. On Monday,new chair Lord Patelsaid Rafiq ""should be praised"" for his bravery and ""should never have been put through"" the Yorkshire's racism scandal.

"Pharma firm plans 1,000 new Northern Ireland jobs","Almac provided clinical trials support to BioNTech as it tested its Covid-19 vaccine Northern Ireland-based pharmaceutical company Almac has said it intends to create 1,800 jobs over the next three years. More than 1,000 of those will be at its Northern Ireland facilities. Almac, which develops its own drugs, is one of Northern Ireland's largest employers, with about 6,000 people across its global operations. A major part of its business is manufacturing and conducting tests for big global firms. Last year the firm, based in Craigavon, County Armagh, played a role in the clinical trials of the first effective Covid-19 vaccine created by Pfizer and BioNTech. Almac had a strong financial performance last year, with pre-tax profit up by 33% The firm's clinical services divisionprovided clinical trials support to BioNTechin areas like distribution, labelling and temperature management. Alan Armstrong, Almac Group chief executive said: ""As demand for our services steadily increases, our aim is to continue to grow our global team by actively recruiting 1,800 new individuals across a wide variety of diverse and exciting areas."" The new jobs include operational, supervisory and managerial roles. Analysis: Ownership keeps firm close to NI roots Almac is one of Northern Ireland's few truly global success stories. A large part of that is down to the drive and vision of the firm's late founder Sir Allen McClay. His legacy lives on in the form of the firm's unusual ownership arrangement- it is controlled by the McClay Foundation charitable trust. That structure means the firm has to constantly reinvest its profits and is also protected from takeover - keeping it close to its Northern Ireland roots. Aside from its operations in Northern Ireland, Almac also has major facilities in the Republic of Ireland, England and the US. In 2020,it increased its pre-tax profit by 33% to Â£63.5m, saying performance had been boosted by licence payments from products developed in-house. Turnover increased by 6% from Â£634m to Â£677m.

Yorkshire's handling of the issues raised by Rafiq was widely criticised - and on 1 November, ESPN reported that the racist term about Rafiq's Pakistani heritage was regularly used towards him, but the investigation concluded it was ""friendly and good-natured banter"". On Friday, chairman Roger Hutton resigned and on Monday, Lord Patel took over, praising Rafiq's ""bravery"" as a whistleblower. Last week,Yorkshire launched another investigationafter another - anonymous - former player alleged he was subjected to repeated racist abuse at the club. Yorkshire cricket racism scandal - how we got here Rafiq should be 'praised' for bravery, says Yorkshire chair Patel No-one at Yorkshire 'racist' but culture 'locked in the past' - Hutton Recounting his alleged experiences, Amjad said: ""On one occasion, we were playing a home game and I had played an attacking shot while batting, the ball went up in the air and I got caught out. ""I was making my way to the dressing room and as I got in, when I started taking my helmet and pads off, the individual came marching through the door and he looked me dead in the eyes."" At this point, the individual used the racist term in reference to ""a typical shot"" played by those of Pakistani heritage. Amjad added: ""And he just left. I was stunned, didn't know what to do and was shocked. I had never been directly racially insulted like that to my face. I didn't know what to do. ""Even before the incident I felt distant, it happened and then I felt isolated after that. Going forwards, I didn't feel I could speak up or give my views on the game in team meetings. ""It crosses your mind [reporting it] but I was a 16-year-old boy and I didn't know what to do. I kept it to myself. ""No-one else shared their experiences with me and I didn't share mine either. If I did open up, those that did experience similar issues may have opened up too."" It is the latest allegation of racism to come to light at Yorkshire following the detailing of Rafiq's story. Ex-Pakistan seamerRana Naved-ul-Hasanwas the second player to allege racism at Yorkshire, saying ""systematic taunting"" occurred at the club. Last Friday, Yorkshire chairmanRoger Huttonwas one of several board members to resign over the club's response to racism experienced by Rafiq. On Monday,new chair Lord Patelsaid Rafiq ""should be praised"" for his bravery and ""should never have been put through"" the Yorkshire's racism scandal.

Tuesday's live coverage was brought to you by Jasmine Taylor-Coleman, James Clarke, Kelly-Leigh Cooper, Paul McLaren, George Bowden, Georgina Rannard and Dulcie Lee. A lot of talk at COP26 has focused on shifting away from global reliance on fossil fuels. The UK government thinks nuclear technology is part of the solution. The UK government'splan to reach ""net-zero"" emissions by 2050says nuclear power provides a ""reliable source of low-carbon electricity"". At the moment about 16% of Britain's electricity is provided by nuclear power from 15 reactors,according to the UK government,external.

A number of British designers and fashion brands - including Mulberry and Burberry - have taken part in a special event for COP26. The Great Fashion for Climate Action show was held at the Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum in Glasgow on Tuesday. It aimed to showcase UK fashion innovation in the context of climate change. British designer Phoebe English was among those who took part. She tells the BBC News Channel the show showcased an array of solutions and ideas to help lessen the industry's burden on the environment. English says the process involves looking at fashion in a ""new light"" including valuing and using our clothes for longer. Designer Stella McCartney showed Prince Charles sustainable solutions last week Barack Obama delivered a personal thank-you message to US staff Barack Obama goes into fist-bump overdrive as he thanks US delegates and staff at COP26. The former US president delivered a personal message to them before heading home from Glasgow. He had focused his trip to Scotland onurging young people to ""stay angry""in the fight against climate change. During his speech to the summit on Monday, Obama said the world is ""nowhere near where we need to be"" to avoid a future climate catastrophe. One of the climate summit's most popular events took place last night - a huge quiz hosted by the organisation Carbon Brief. With 600 people attending virtually and online, it was a welcome break in the long days and nights at COP. And congratulations to the University of East Anglia who won for the second year running. But what really grabbed our attention is just how difficult the questions were. Prepare yourself to try to answer: ""If Paris = 21 and Berlin = 1, solve this equation: Doha/Milan = ?"".... No, we didn't get it either. The full quiz is onYouTube,externalshould you find yourself with several hours to spare..  We'll be bringing today's live coverage of the COP26 conference in Glasgow to a close in the next half hour. But first: a catch-up of Tuesday's main developments:  James FitzGeraldBBC Minute Gender and innovation have been todayâs top themes at
COP26. And nobody captures the spirit of the day quite like Vinisha Umashankar,
a 15-year-old inventor from southern India. She was the youngest finalist in the Duke of Cambridgeâs
recent Earthshot Prize for creative solutions to the worldâs problems. That was
thanks to her creation of a solar-powered cart that provides a mobile
clothes-ironing service without relying on traditional charcoal-burning.  This video can not be played India's ironing vendors use charcoal as fuel, but this cart harnesses the Sun's energy Itâs an effort to curb âair pollution, deforestation, respiratory diseases, and climate change,"" Vinisha told BBC Minute earlier in the conference. She says we can all do our bit to tackle these issues. âIf you look at climate change as a huge problem, then you get overwhelmed,â she explains. âBut when you think about it, it's these small problems that come together to cause climate change. If we just focus on solving these little problems, then climate change is much easier to look at."" She gave a speech to world leaders at COP26 last week, which she says was a combination of âfrustration and urgency, but also optimism.â âThey are definitely working the best they can, but sometimes itâs best to pick up the pace and speed things up, because we donât have much time left to take things at our own speed.â Sixteen people were arrested following a COP26 climate protest in Glasgow yesterday evening. Police say they initially ""facilitated a peaceful protest"" outside The Engine Works conference and dining venue in the Maryhill area of the city. But officers stepped in after some demonstrators from the Glasgow Calls Out Polluters group lay down in the road. A Police Scotland spokesman said: ""All of the 16 arrested were issued with a recorded police warning and released."" Two protesters have chained themselves together outside a bank Meanwhile, two protesters covered in fake blood have chained themselves together in a protest outside the offices of a bank in the centre of Glasgow. The area around St Vincent Street has been blocked and around 150 police officers are at the scene. Other protesters are holding banners calling for an end to deforestation. Fewer than 50 arrestswere made during the first week of COP26. Police have praised the majority of ""good natured"" protesters who have taken part in demos across Glasgow,including the estimated 100,000 marchers who took to the streets on Saturday. Megha MohanBBC Gender & Identity Correspondent Climate change dominates conversations for Kathy Jetnil-Kijiner, Hilda Heine and Peinum âThese conversations spill over to the dinner table. The other day my granddaughter Peinum asked about why water was coming over the seawallâ, Hilda Heine tells the BBC. She is a former president of the Marshall Islands, and also the first woman ever to lead an independent Pacific Islands nation. âWhen did she ask about that?â asks her daughter Kathy Jetnil-Kijiner, Peinumâs mother. âAbout two weeks ago,â Heine replies. âYes, she doesnât just ask questions, she grills me about climate change,â adds her daughter, a poet and Marshall Islands climate envoy for COP26. Home to just over 59,000 people, the Republic of the Marshall Islands comprises five isolated islands and 29 atolls. At their lowest points, the atolls sit just above sea level. Since 1993, sea levels in the Marshall Islands have risen by 7mm (0.3 inches) per year, double the global average, according to the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. By 2030, the islandsâ surrounding sea level is expected to rise by 9cm, drastically increasing the frequency and the impact of storm surges and coastal flooding. The mother-daughter team say they play to each otherâs strengths when fighting for their country. Stephen McDonellBBC News, China correspondent From late September, north-eastern China was hit by major
electricity shortages with some shops using candlelight to stay open, industries told to ration power and even global supply chains disrupted as
factories had to halt production. The roots of the power crisis are complex. Chinaâs economy came out of the Covid crisis earlier than
most countries, leading to a surge in international demand for goods made here.
This generated an unexpected increase in electricity use of about 10%. Because this came as something of a surprise to many
officials, there wasnât enough coal coming through to meet needs and the
country is still a long way off having enough non-coal fired power options to
turn to. Coal prices nearly doubled but consumer electricity prices
remained steady, as per government mandate. In this climate, producing more electricity meant companies losing money. So, as you might expect, they didnât want to increase output. Now, the pricing system in China is already being altered to better reflect market demand but these overall pressures have not been properly resolved. In the short-term, a solution was needed to get through this winter. The decision: increase coal production. More broadly, the Chinese government says coal-fired electricity will increase up until 2025 and only then be reduced as a proportion of power in the energy mix. Long-term, this country needs more renewable power and crucially, a much larger capacity to store it. Non-fossil fuel electricity (including nuclear and hydro) will hit 47.3% of installed capacity by the end of this year. It may sound like a lot but itâs not nearly enough for China to achieve its stated environmental protection ambitions. This video can not be played COP26: Barack Obama stops by at Strathclyde University Crowds have gathered to greet Barack Obama as he visited Strathclyde University for talks with COP26 youth leaders. The Obama Foundation roundtable event in Glasgow yesterday evening discussed how the current generation can lead the fight against climate change. Leaving the event, the former US president urged onlookers to ""get active"". Prof Sir Jim McDonald, the university principal, says the visit by such a ""global champion of social progress and equality"" is an honour for the entire Strathclyde community. The former US president visited Strathclyde University in Glasgow for talks with COP26 youth leaders. More reaction now to the new report that saysthe world is nowhere near its goals on limited global temperature rises- despite COP26 pledges. Dr Kat Kramer, climate policy lead for Christian Aid, describes the analysis as ""yet another screaming siren"". Ed Miliband, the UK's shadow business secretary, says the report is an ""important reality check on the government's attempt to greenwash Glasgow"". ""All countries urgently need to step up the ambition and to agree to revisit these issues well before 2025, otherwise the chance to limit global warming to 1.5C will slip irrevocably through our hands,"" he says. An Afghan climate campaigner has alleged his visa to attend COP26 is stuck in limbo after officials failed to clear it in time. Nasratullah Mateen has said he was officially invited to attend the summit in Glasgow - and would have been his country's only accredited delegate - but has since struggled to get a visa to fly into the UK. ""They failed me, and the voice of over 34 million people who are already severely affected by the climate crisis,"" he wrote on Twitter. We have contacted the Cop26 organisers for comment.

Alok Sharma said there was still a mountain to climb in negotiations President of COP26, Alok Sharma, says prediction reports about temperature rises demonstrate ""that there has been some progress but clearly not enough"". Analysis from Climate Action Trackerpublished this afternooncalculates the world is heading for 2.4C of warming, far more than the 1.5C limit nations have committed to. ""If we look at where we were heading before Paris (climate talks in 2015) the trajectory on some of the analysis suggested we were heading to 6C of global warming,"" he says. ""Post-Paris, those commitments were taking us to below 4C, and now I think you see various reports that suggest we've bent the curve towards 2C. ""But of course that isn't good enough,"" he adds. ""What we've always said is that we want at this COP to be able to say with credibility that we're keeping 1.5C alive, 1.5C within reach. ""And that is what we're going to be working towards over the coming days."" The governments of 22 countries and the European Commission have confirmed they will work together to invest in clean energy technologies to help reduce the carbon used by challenging industries. Four ""missions"" will help facilitate urban transitions, eliminate emissions from industry, enable CO2 removal and produce renewable fuels. They are part of Mission Innovation - which brings together governments from every
continent, international organisations, and private sector investors. The announcement has been described as a ""breakthrough"" and championed by US climate envoy John Kerry, who says it's ""accelerating innovation across challenging sectors and
technologies to enable a net-zero transition by mid-century"". Sir Patrick Vallance, the UK government's chief scientific advisor says: âReaching
global net zero by mid-century requires intense international collaboration on
research and innovation to develop and deliver solutions across all sectors of
the global economy."" He says Mission Innovation will provide an
important platform for the public and private sectors around the world to
work together over the next decade. Letâs turn now to US representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who has been speaking at a COP26 event on climate action. Ocasio-Cortez - often known simply by her initials AOC - is one of the most vocal voices in US politics advocating radical action on climate change. She begins her speech by declaring the US is âbackâ as a climate leader after the Trump administration - but says her partyâs approach is now âfundamentally differentâ to before. She explains they are moving away from âpure market-based solutionsâ to climate change that were around 10 years ago. Instead, she says, grassroots activists are now invited to help shape policy, citingthe Green New Deal- a radical plan to transform the economy and tackle climate change. She says it shows ""we can't just pursue decarbonisation"" - plans will have to benefit the working class, the vulnerable, frontline communities, people of colour, women and underserved communities. Justice and jobs must be the focus of any climate plans, she adds. âThatâs whatâs going to make it politically popular and where weâre going to mobilise our economy to meet these aggressive targets.â Environment group Greenpeace describes the new report from Climate Action Tracker we've been reporting on this afternoon as ""devastating"" and is urging governments to work with ""vigour for a deal to save our common future"" and ""turn this thing around"". Executive Director
Jennifer Morgan says the report - whichpredicts the world is on track for a 2.4C temperature rise despite recent pledges- is like a ""telescope trained on an asteroid heading for
Earth"". ""Weâve just been told what the future holds,"" she says of the report. ""Everybody knows what we need to
do to change it. No more excuses, timeâs up, our leaders need to deliver, and
now.â James FitzGeraldBBC Minute The Little Amal puppet is 3.5m tall More now on the appearance at COP26 from Little Amal - a not-so-little puppet depicting a
refugee girl from Syria. One of the puppeteers who has animated Amal during her 8,000km journey across Europe has told BBC Minute why todayâs appearance on Gender Day is
so meaningful. âShe can stand for
so much and be a beacon for so many things,â says Sebastian Charles, from Good
Chance Theatre. âItâs a really positive step in the right direction in terms of
equality.â Amal cannot communicate verbally but Sebastian says her silence speaks volumes. âRather than make political statements, sheâs able to just be in the room - and her presence alone sparks conversationsâ, he explains. âOne of them is climate change, which can be linked to the refugee crisis.â The 3.5m-tall character was made by War Horse creators The Handspring Puppet Company. Controlling Amal can be a challenge â and Seb is just one of a team of puppeteers today. âThereâs no book that you can dust off and read how to animate something like this,â he says. âItâs definitely something that you learn on the job.â Special Presidential Envoy for Climate, John Kerry, is among those representing the US at the COP26 summit. He's appeared today at a panel event organised by Bloomberg. Kerry describes Donald Trump's withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement as showing ""vindictive mischief"" without science or economic sense - something he says has hurt the US reputation abroad. Asked about the pledges made in Glasgow so far, he says he hopes the summit is building into something ""very significant"" but is also a ""test"" and a ""checkpoint"" on what was agreed in Paris. ""This COP is already different and better than any COP I've ever been to,"" he says of the conference. ""There is a greater sense of urgency, a greater sense of focus, a greater sense of possibilities."" But the envoy acknowledges there are still ""some issues"" to be worked out in the coming days. Asked if the progress being made is enough, Kerry says the US is still ""hopeful"" other nations - including China - can be brought into agreements made on methane. He also says it will be ""insanity"" not to closely measure the progress being made every year at future conferences in line with pledges. Â© 2025 BBC.

More reaction now to the new report that saysthe world is nowhere near its goals on limited global temperature rises- despite COP26 pledges. Dr Kat Kramer, climate policy lead for Christian Aid, describes the analysis as ""yet another screaming siren"". Ed Miliband, the UK's shadow business secretary, says the report is an ""important reality check on the government's attempt to greenwash Glasgow"". ""All countries urgently need to step up the ambition and to agree to revisit these issues well before 2025, otherwise the chance to limit global warming to 1.5C will slip irrevocably through our hands,"" he says. An Afghan climate campaigner has alleged his visa to attend COP26 is stuck in limbo after officials failed to clear it in time. Nasratullah Mateen has said he was officially invited to attend the summit in Glasgow - and would have been his country's only accredited delegate - but has since struggled to get a visa to fly into the UK. ""They failed me, and the voice of over 34 million people who are already severely affected by the climate crisis,"" he wrote on Twitter. We have contacted the Cop26 organisers for comment.

Alok Sharma said there was still a mountain to climb in negotiations President of COP26, Alok Sharma, says prediction reports about temperature rises demonstrate ""that there has been some progress but clearly not enough"". Analysis from Climate Action Trackerpublished this afternooncalculates the world is heading for 2.4C of warming, far more than the 1.5C limit nations have committed to. ""If we look at where we were heading before Paris (climate talks in 2015) the trajectory on some of the analysis suggested we were heading to 6C of global warming,"" he says. ""Post-Paris, those commitments were taking us to below 4C, and now I think you see various reports that suggest we've bent the curve towards 2C. ""But of course that isn't good enough,"" he adds. ""What we've always said is that we want at this COP to be able to say with credibility that we're keeping 1.5C alive, 1.5C within reach. ""And that is what we're going to be working towards over the coming days."" The governments of 22 countries and the European Commission have confirmed they will work together to invest in clean energy technologies to help reduce the carbon used by challenging industries. Four ""missions"" will help facilitate urban transitions, eliminate emissions from industry, enable CO2 removal and produce renewable fuels. They are part of Mission Innovation - which brings together governments from every
continent, international organisations, and private sector investors. The announcement has been described as a ""breakthrough"" and championed by US climate envoy John Kerry, who says it's ""accelerating innovation across challenging sectors and
technologies to enable a net-zero transition by mid-century"". Sir Patrick Vallance, the UK government's chief scientific advisor says: âReaching
global net zero by mid-century requires intense international collaboration on
research and innovation to develop and deliver solutions across all sectors of
the global economy."" He says Mission Innovation will provide an
important platform for the public and private sectors around the world to
work together over the next decade. Letâs turn now to US representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who has been speaking at a COP26 event on climate action. Ocasio-Cortez - often known simply by her initials AOC - is one of the most vocal voices in US politics advocating radical action on climate change. She begins her speech by declaring the US is âbackâ as a climate leader after the Trump administration - but says her partyâs approach is now âfundamentally differentâ to before. She explains they are moving away from âpure market-based solutionsâ to climate change that were around 10 years ago. Instead, she says, grassroots activists are now invited to help shape policy, citingthe Green New Deal- a radical plan to transform the economy and tackle climate change. She says it shows ""we can't just pursue decarbonisation"" - plans will have to benefit the working class, the vulnerable, frontline communities, people of colour, women and underserved communities. Justice and jobs must be the focus of any climate plans, she adds. âThatâs whatâs going to make it politically popular and where weâre going to mobilise our economy to meet these aggressive targets.â Environment group Greenpeace describes the new report from Climate Action Tracker we've been reporting on this afternoon as ""devastating"" and is urging governments to work with ""vigour for a deal to save our common future"" and ""turn this thing around"". Executive Director
Jennifer Morgan says the report - whichpredicts the world is on track for a 2.4C temperature rise despite recent pledges- is like a ""telescope trained on an asteroid heading for
Earth"". ""Weâve just been told what the future holds,"" she says of the report. ""Everybody knows what we need to
do to change it. No more excuses, timeâs up, our leaders need to deliver, and
now.â James FitzGeraldBBC Minute The Little Amal puppet is 3.5m tall More now on the appearance at COP26 from Little Amal - a not-so-little puppet depicting a
refugee girl from Syria. One of the puppeteers who has animated Amal during her 8,000km journey across Europe has told BBC Minute why todayâs appearance on Gender Day is
so meaningful. âShe can stand for
so much and be a beacon for so many things,â says Sebastian Charles, from Good
Chance Theatre. âItâs a really positive step in the right direction in terms of
equality.â Amal cannot communicate verbally but Sebastian says her silence speaks volumes. âRather than make political statements, sheâs able to just be in the room - and her presence alone sparks conversationsâ, he explains. âOne of them is climate change, which can be linked to the refugee crisis.â The 3.5m-tall character was made by War Horse creators The Handspring Puppet Company. Controlling Amal can be a challenge â and Seb is just one of a team of puppeteers today. âThereâs no book that you can dust off and read how to animate something like this,â he says. âItâs definitely something that you learn on the job.â Special Presidential Envoy for Climate, John Kerry, is among those representing the US at the COP26 summit. He's appeared today at a panel event organised by Bloomberg. Kerry describes Donald Trump's withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement as showing ""vindictive mischief"" without science or economic sense - something he says has hurt the US reputation abroad. Asked about the pledges made in Glasgow so far, he says he hopes the summit is building into something ""very significant"" but is also a ""test"" and a ""checkpoint"" on what was agreed in Paris. ""This COP is already different and better than any COP I've ever been to,"" he says of the conference. ""There is a greater sense of urgency, a greater sense of focus, a greater sense of possibilities."" But the envoy acknowledges there are still ""some issues"" to be worked out in the coming days. Asked if the progress being made is enough, Kerry says the US is still ""hopeful"" other nations - including China - can be brought into agreements made on methane. He also says it will be ""insanity"" not to closely measure the progress being made every year at future conferences in line with pledges. Â© 2025 BBC.

Tuesday's live coverage was brought to you by Jasmine Taylor-Coleman, James Clarke, Kelly-Leigh Cooper, Paul McLaren, George Bowden, Georgina Rannard and Dulcie Lee. A lot of talk at COP26 has focused on shifting away from global reliance on fossil fuels. The UK government thinks nuclear technology is part of the solution. The UK government'splan to reach ""net-zero"" emissions by 2050says nuclear power provides a ""reliable source of low-carbon electricity"". At the moment about 16% of Britain's electricity is provided by nuclear power from 15 reactors,according to the UK government,external. But it wants around a quarter of Britain's energy to come from nuclear by 2025. So how safe and green is nuclear and how much is it used around the world? Read more in our guide.  Helen BriggsEnvironment correspondent in Glasgow Week two, and there's a familiar rhythm to the day. Wake, check the news, do a Covid test, check the news again. Then a walk beside the majestic River Clyde as joggers and cyclists dodge the stream of suited-and-booted delegates making their way to COP. Police patrol outside the iron gates but, once I'm through security, I'm in the ""Blue Zone"" where the key negotiations between world leaders are taking place. This is United Nations - not Scottish - territory for this fortnight only. I spend much of my day in the Press Centre where hundreds of journalists sit at socially-distanced desks, existing on a diet of carbon-counted sarnies and Irn-Bru. I'll be checking out stories, conducting interviews and filing copy. The air is charged with adrenaline, but through the windows there's a calming glimpse of the river beyond. Now and again, there's the sound of a helicopter hovering overhead. Information flows in and out at a mind-boggling speed, with journalists constantly coming and going to events and briefings. It's exhilarating and sometimes exhausting. Read more from Helen here. A number of British designers and fashion brands - including Mulberry and Burberry - have taken part in a special event for COP26. The Great Fashion for Climate Action show was held at the Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum in Glasgow on Tuesday. It aimed to showcase UK fashion innovation in the context of climate change. British designer Phoebe English was among those who took part. She tells the BBC News Channel the show showcased an array of solutions and ideas to help lessen the industry's burden on the environment. English says the process involves looking at fashion in a ""new light"" including valuing and using our clothes for longer. Designer Stella McCartney showed Prince Charles sustainable solutions last week Barack Obama delivered a personal thank-you message to US staff Barack Obama goes into fist-bump overdrive as he thanks US delegates and staff at COP26. The former US president delivered a personal message to them before heading home from Glasgow. He had focused his trip to Scotland onurging young people to ""stay angry""in the fight against climate change. During his speech to the summit on Monday, Obama said the world is ""nowhere near where we need to be"" to avoid a future climate catastrophe. One of the climate summit's most popular events took place last night - a huge quiz hosted by the organisation Carbon Brief. With 600 people attending virtually and online, it was a welcome break in the long days and nights at COP. And congratulations to the University of East Anglia who won for the second year running. But what really grabbed our attention is just how difficult the questions were. Prepare yourself to try to answer: ""If Paris = 21 and Berlin = 1, solve this equation: Doha/Milan = ?"".... No, we didn't get it either. The full quiz is onYouTube,externalshould you find yourself with several hours to spare..  We'll be bringing today's live coverage of the COP26 conference in Glasgow to a close in the next half hour. But first: a catch-up of Tuesday's main developments:  James FitzGeraldBBC Minute Gender and innovation have been todayâs top themes at
COP26. And nobody captures the spirit of the day quite like Vinisha Umashankar,
a 15-year-old inventor from southern India. She was the youngest finalist in the Duke of Cambridgeâs
recent Earthshot Prize for creative solutions to the worldâs problems. That was
thanks to her creation of a solar-powered cart that provides a mobile
clothes-ironing service without relying on traditional charcoal-burning.  This video can not be played India's ironing vendors use charcoal as fuel, but this cart harnesses the Sun's energy Itâs an effort to curb âair pollution, deforestation, respiratory diseases, and climate change,"" Vinisha told BBC Minute earlier in the conference. She says we can all do our bit to tackle these issues. âIf you look at climate change as a huge problem, then you get overwhelmed,â she explains. âBut when you think about it, it's these small problems that come together to cause climate change. If we just focus on solving these little problems, then climate change is much easier to look at."" She gave a speech to world leaders at COP26 last week, which she says was a combination of âfrustration and urgency, but also optimism.â âThey are definitely working the best they can, but sometimes itâs best to pick up the pace and speed things up, because we donât have much time left to take things at our own speed.â Sixteen people were arrested following a COP26 climate protest in Glasgow yesterday evening. Police say they initially ""facilitated a peaceful protest"" outside The Engine Works conference and dining venue in the Maryhill area of the city. But officers stepped in after some demonstrators from the Glasgow Calls Out Polluters group lay down in the road. A Police Scotland spokesman said: ""All of the 16 arrested were issued with a recorded police warning and released."" Two protesters have chained themselves together outside a bank Meanwhile, two protesters covered in fake blood have chained themselves together in a protest outside the offices of a bank in the centre of Glasgow. The area around St Vincent Street has been blocked and around 150 police officers are at the scene. Other protesters are holding banners calling for an end to deforestation. Fewer than 50 arrestswere made during the first week of COP26. Police have praised the majority of ""good natured"" protesters who have taken part in demos across Glasgow,including the estimated 100,000 marchers who took to the streets on Saturday. Megha MohanBBC Gender & Identity Correspondent Climate change dominates conversations for Kathy Jetnil-Kijiner, Hilda Heine and Peinum âThese conversations spill over to the dinner table. The other day my granddaughter Peinum asked about why water was coming over the seawallâ, Hilda Heine tells the BBC. She is a former president of the Marshall Islands, and also the first woman ever to lead an independent Pacific Islands nation. âWhen did she ask about that?â asks her daughter Kathy Jetnil-Kijiner, Peinumâs mother. âAbout two weeks ago,â Heine replies. âYes, she doesnât just ask questions, she grills me about climate change,â adds her daughter, a poet and Marshall Islands climate envoy for COP26. Home to just over 59,000 people, the Republic of the Marshall Islands comprises five isolated islands and 29 atolls. At their lowest points, the atolls sit just above sea level. Since 1993, sea levels in the Marshall Islands have risen by 7mm (0.3 inches) per year, double the global average, according to the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. By 2030, the islandsâ surrounding sea level is expected to rise by 9cm, drastically increasing the frequency and the impact of storm surges and coastal flooding. The mother-daughter team say they play to each otherâs strengths when fighting for their country. Stephen McDonellBBC News, China correspondent From late September, north-eastern China was hit by major
electricity shortages with some shops using candlelight to stay open, industries told to ration power and even global supply chains disrupted as
factories had to halt production. The roots of the power crisis are complex. Chinaâs economy came out of the Covid crisis earlier than
most countries, leading to a surge in international demand for goods made here.
This generated an unexpected increase in electricity use of about 10%. Because this came as something of a surprise to many
officials, there wasnât enough coal coming through to meet needs and the
country is still a long way off having enough non-coal fired power options to
turn to. Coal prices nearly doubled but consumer electricity prices
remained steady, as per government mandate. In this climate, producing more electricity meant companies losing money. So, as you might expect, they didnât want to increase output. Now, the pricing system in China is already being altered to better reflect market demand but these overall pressures have not been properly resolved. In the short-term, a solution was needed to get through this winter. The decision: increase coal production. More broadly, the Chinese government says coal-fired electricity will increase up until 2025 and only then be reduced as a proportion of power in the energy mix. Long-term, this country needs more renewable power and crucially, a much larger capacity to store it. Non-fossil fuel electricity (including nuclear and hydro) will hit 47.3% of installed capacity by the end of this year. It may sound like a lot but itâs not nearly enough for China to achieve its stated environmental protection ambitions.

"Little progress in EU-UK talks on NI, says DUP","Sir Jeffrey Donaldson says EU proposals to address protocol problems do not go far enough Democratic Unionist party (DUP) leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson has said little progress appears to have been made in talks between the UK government and EU on the Northern Ireland Protocol. He was speaking after meeting Brexit Minister Lord Frost on Monday. The Northern Ireland Protocol is the Brexit trade deal aimed at avoiding a hard Irish border. Sir Jeffrey said the update from Lord Frost revealed that ""significant gaps"" on the issue are yet to be resolved. ""I have again reiterated that Northern Ireland's place in the UK internal market must be restored and we cannot continue to be subject to laws in Northern Ireland upon which we have no say or input,"" he said. Why Brexit still has a Northern Ireland problem ""Decisions will very soon need to be taken on whether they can in fact be concluded successfully. ""In the absence of agreement, the UK government must follow through on the commitments made in their command paper. ""The protocol continues to damage our economy and the political institutions in Northern Ireland and the status quo is not an option."" The command paper seeks a renegotiation of the protocol rather than merely tweaking its operation. Separately, the leader of the Progressive Unionist Party (PUP) Billy Hutchinson has called for ""corrective action"" to restore Northern Ireland's constitutional position within the UK. He said the ""constitutional guarantee"" inthe Good Friday Agreementwas ""not as was promised to the unionist community"" and he called for a ""rebalancing"" of how the 1998 peace deal was being implemented in relation to the Northern Ireland Protocol. The remarks by unionist leaders come after a weekend of high-profile criticism of the UK government's position on the protocol from both within the UK and the EU. The protocol keeps Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods, unlike the rest of the UK, and led to new checks on goods arriving into Northern Ireland from Great Britain. Supporters argue it has created new opportunities for Northern Ireland businesses but opponents say it undermines the union between Great Britain and Northern Ireland and disrupts supply chains. The Northern Ireland Protocol was negotiated between the EU and the UK government in late 2019. But the UK government now wants significant reform of the agreement. Lord Frost, who helped to negotiate the protocol, argues that the arrangement is now harming the peace process in Northern Ireland. Lord Frost has called for fundamental reform of the deal he helped to negotiate two years ago Last month, theEU offered new proposals to resolved the long-running dispute, which it said would cut the number of spot checks on goods by about 80%. It also offered to change to laws to ensure no disruption to moving medicines across the Irish Sea. However, the UK said more fundamental change was required, including removing the European Court of Justice from an oversight role. Article 16 exists to fix difficulties with the Northern Ireland Protocol that are causing serious problems or causing diversion of trade. The UK government says that threshold was reached long ago and so it can be used legitimately. But the EU fears the UK is planning to use Article 16 in an expansive way - to gut the protocol, sweep away the Irish Sea border and open up a potential back door into the single market. The EU may argue that the broader Brexit trade deal only happened because the issue of the Irish border had been sorted out first. Therefore if the UK collapses that border solution the EU may give notice that it intends to collapse the trade deal. Last week Belgium's Deputy Prime Minister Vincent Van Peteghem suggested that is figuring in the EU's thinking andSimon Coveney alluded to it again on Sunday. Read more:What is Article 16 and why does it matter? The DUP leader has previously suggested thathis party may quit its role in Northern Ireland's devolved governmentif its demands over the protocol are not met. At Stormont on Monday, the leader of the SDLP called on Lord Frost and the DUP to ""think very carefully"" about the language used in relation to the protocol. Colum Eastwood said they were ""creating more and more instability on the streets of Northern Ireland"". ""We should take away the threat to these institutions, we should take away the pretence that there's some big battle around the protocol when it's absolutely clear to anybody that the European Union have offered the people of Northern Ireland everything that they asked for,"" he said. Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) MicheÃ¡l Martin told Irish national broadcaster RTÃ that ""nothing is certain"" in relation to the UK's threat to trigger Article 16 but he repeated his view thatsuch a move would be ""reckless and irresponsible"",external. At the weekend, former Prime Minister Sir John Major was among those who criticised the UK government's stance on the protocol, and saidtriggering Article 16 would be absurd and ""colossally stupid"". European Commission Vice-PresidentMaros Sefcovic warned it would lead to ""instability and unpredictability"" for Northern Irelandand Irish Foreign MinisterSimon Coveney hinted the EU could terminate its post-Brexit Trade and Cooperation Agreementin response. In a weekend statement, the UK government said it would prefer to ""settle the issues arising from the operation of the Northern Ireland Protocol consensually"". However, it said its responsibility was ""to safeguard peace and prosperity in Northern Ireland, and we will use Article 16 if necessary"". Billy Hutchinson says the Belfast Agreement as currently implemented is not the deal he signed up to in 1998 Meanwhile, Mr Hutchinson of the PUP described the protocol as a ""real and present threat"" to the substance of the union between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. In adetailed statement posted to the PUP's website,external, Mr Hutchinson said a recent legal challenge to the protocol had ""exposed the principle of consent to be little more than a deceptive snare"". Mr Hutchinson was part of the loyalist negotiating team for the 1998 Good Friday Agreement. His party's statement said its support for that deal was ""rooted in the purported guarantee provided by the principle of consent"". ""We urged support for the agreement on the basis that the union was safe, so long as a majority of persons living here wished it to be so,"" he said. ""If, as is currently the case, the constitutional guarantee is not as was promised to the unionist community, then there is no basis for unionist support for the Belfast Agreement."" However, Mr Hutchinson told the BBC's Talkback programme the PUP was not withdrawing its support for the deal signed in 1998 but rather campaigning for changes to how that deal was being implemented in relation to the protocol.

Ghislaine Maxwell to challenge accusers' memories,"Ms Maxwell's criminal trial will begin on 29 November and is expected to last six weeks Ghislaine Maxwell will challenge claims that she groomed underage girls for the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein to sexually abuse. According to a letter by her lawyer, the British socialite's defence will say her accusers might have faulty memories. The letter says that leading experts in psychiatry and memory would be brought in to testify in her defence. Ms Maxwell, 59, has pleaded not guilty to all the charges against her. She has been in a New York jail since her arrest in July last year, awaiting the trial which will begin on 29 November and last six weeks. The letter, written by Ms Maxwell's lawyer Jeffrey Pagliuca,external, gives a first glimpse at what her legal team are hoping to use to defend her in court. Elizabeth Loftus, a psychologist specialising in false memory, is one of the experts they are hoping to call. She has testified in more than 300 trials, including those for high-profile defendants such as Harvey Weinstein, Ted Bundy and OJ Simpson. According to her profile on the UCI School of Social Ecology, Ms Loftus' research has revealed how memories can be changed by things we are told and information we subtly absorb after an event. ""She will describe scientific research showing that false memories can be described with confidence, detail, and emotion, just like true memories,"" the letter reads. Another expert the defence wants to use is leading forensic psychiatrist Park Dietz, who has 40 years experience and has been part of more than 1,000 evaluations of allegations of sexual abuse, according to the letter. Mr Dietz would testify that building the trust of the accusers did not automatically imply they would be abused. Who is Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's ex-girlfriend?

He would also argue that there is no consistent definition for the term ""grooming"", and therefore no empirical evidence that Ms Maxwell committed ""grooming-by-proxy"" by allegedly arranging sexualized massages for Epstein. Mr Dietz would testify that Epstein, ""like many people who achieve great power and wealth"" created and exploited a ""halo effect to surround himself with people who would serve his needs"". A hearing on admitting expert testimony is scheduled for Wednesday. Ms Maxwell, the daughter of media mogul Robert Maxwell, has been accused of helping to recruit and groom four underage girls for Epstein to abuse from 1994 to 2004, and also charged with sex trafficking. Epstein killed himself in a New York prison cell on 10 August as he awaited his trial on sex trafficking charges.
