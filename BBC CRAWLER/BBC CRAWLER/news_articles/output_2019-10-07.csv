Abortion guidelines issued as NI deadline looms,"The medical profession is to receive new guidelines ahead of a change in the abortion law in Northern Ireland The government has publishedguidance for healthcare professionals on abortion law in Northern Ireland,external. The new guidelines cover the period from 22 October to 31 March 2020. They set out what will happen following changes to the law after 21 October, if the NI Executive is not restored. The guidance states that no criminal charges can be brought against those who have an abortion, or against health care professionals who provide and assist in an abortion. The government said it has made arrangements to support women resident in Northern Ireland wishing to access services under the existing travel scheme. In the interim period, abortions in cases of ""fatal or serious fetal anomaly"" may be carried out. Clock is ticking for NI abortion law Hundreds in healthcare oppose abortion law Health professionals will be given information about funded services in England. If a woman approaches them and is considering an abortion, they should give her the number for the Central Booking Service in England or call the helpline on her behalf. Also from 22 October all the travel and accommodation needs of women will be funded, regardless of income. Further detail is also provided on conscientious objection. The guidance notes that in England and Wales, the courts have found that its scope is limited to participating in a ""hands on"" capacity and does not allow for objection to ancillary or administrative tasks. It further states ""in the interim period, anyone who has a conscientious objection to abortion may want to raise this with their employer"". It says if they see a patient who is considering an abortion, they should follow guidance from their professional body. Analysis by Marie-Louise Connolly, Health Correspondent What's critical about these guidelines is that they recognise that women must be made aware of all choices available to them. Also any support and advice must be provided without fear of either party worrying about being prosecuted. In effect, what the guidelines do is remove the abortion issue from under the shadows, bringing it out into the open and allowing a light to be thrown on what is an extremely emotive and contentious issue. Will they remove all stigma? Absolutely not. As Sarah Ewart described last week outside court, no one wakes up and willingly or without feeling chooses to have a termination. Some details have  yet to be spelt out. For instance, if a woman or girl needs to be accompanied, will that person's expenses be covered too? How is this information or guidance to be shared among the public? While the guidelines were dropped somewhat quietly into the public domain, the response from some will be a lot more robust, with many people publicly shocked and dismayed about what is about to become legal in just a fortnight's time. This video can not be played Sarah Ewart (left) led a high-profile campaign to change NI's law in cases of fatal fetal abnormality The guidance recognises that some women may continue to buy medical abortion pills online. As these are prescription only, their sale and supply remains unlawful but women ""will be able to seek medical assistance in NI"". Health professionals, notes the guidance, will not be under any duty to report an offence. It also sets out that a public consultation on the proposed legal framework for Northern Ireland will open on or just after 22 October. The government said it is ""imperative that health and social care professionals understand these changes and their duties under the law, if the duty comes into effect and the law changes"". It also makes clear that this supersedes guidance provided by the Northern Ireland Department of Health in 2016. The government states that, given the ""urgent timescales"" presented by the 21 October deadline, there are no plans for additional services to be routinely available in Northern Ireland before 31 March 2020. For example, there is no expectation that GPs will prescribe medication for early medical abortion. A silent demonstration was held at Stormont over the planned change in abortion legislation For 52 years, the law on terminations has been much more restrictive in this part of the UK than in England, Scotland and Wales. But that is set to change if the devolved government at Stormont is not restored by 21 October. Legislation brought in by MPs at Westminster means abortion will be decriminalised and the government will have to put in place regulations for abortion services by next April. The change in legislation in Northern Ireland will be welcomed by many people, but many others are strongly opposed and hundreds ofhealth professionalswrote to the Northern Ireland secretary expressing their opposition to any change. Both an anti-abortion rally (left) and pro-choice rally attracted large crowds in Belfast city centre in September Northern Ireland's abortion legislation is very different from the law in Great Britain. The 1967 Abortion Act, which was introduced in England, Scotland and Wales, was never extended to Northern Ireland. Currently, a termination is only permitted in Northern Ireland if a woman's life is at risk or if there is a risk of permanent and serious damage to her mental or physical health. Rape, incest or diagnoses of fatal fetal abnormality - where medics believe that a baby will die before, during or shortly after birth - are not grounds for a legal abortion in Northern Ireland. Last week, the High Court in Belfast ruled thatNorthern Ireland's abortion law breaches the UK's human rights commitments. The case was taken in Belfast by Sarah Ewart, who challenged the law after she was denied a termination in 2013. Doctors said her fetus would not survive outside the womb. She travelled to England for a termination. Since then she has led a high-profile campaign to change Northern Ireland's law in cases of fatal fetal abnormality. Dawn McAvoy, from Both Lives Matters, told BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme that there are ""grave concerns that for the first time in Northern Ireland, children diagnosed in the womb with disabilities are going to be permitted to have their lives ended in law"". She said there was still hope that Stormont would be restored before 21 October. ""This document shows why it is seriously reckless to remove legislation without putting a pre-arranged regulatory framework in place first,"" she added. Grainne Teggart, from Amnesty NI, argued that the changes to the law ""cannot come quick enough"". She added: ""What is very clear is that we are finally getting to a place where we will have a compassionate response to crisis pregnancy. ""This is about placing the issue where it should always have been - not a criminal justice matter but between each individual woman and her doctor.""

Pizza Express set for talks over Â£1bn debt pile,"Pizza Express has reportedly hired financial advisers ahead of a meeting with lenders to review its debt situation. The 470-store chain made losses for the last two years as its operating profits were more than offset by high interest payments on its Â£1.1bn debt pile. Sales in the UK and in its 150 overseas restaurants both fell last year. Founded in 1965, Pizza Express employs 14,000 people and is now owned by Chinese private investment firm Hony. The Chinese company bought it from UK private equity firm Cinven in 2014. Few companies emerge from private equity deals without being laden with borrowing. Interestingly, Pizza Express uses exactly the same font and layout for its financial statements as it does for its menus. Unlike the menu, however, there are some quite unappetising items in its financials. Most off-putting of all, of course, is the enormous debt number. The interest on that Â£1.1bn is costing the company Â£93m a year, which wiped out all its operating profit last year - and then some. In fact, the debt payments have pushed Pizza Express into the red for the last two years with a loss of Â£55m last year alone. The frustrating thing for the business is that it is making a reasonable amount of cash. It's for that reason, its auditors were happy to conclude the chain is a viable going concern when it signed off its accounts in April this year despite the company's debts being worth more than its assets. To be clear, Pizza Express is not in imminent danger of going bust. It has until 2021 before it needs to start paying back Â£600m to its outside creditors. (The other Â£500m is a loan from its Chinese owners). But debt is a serial company killer - just ask Carillion or Thomas Cook. It can suffocate a company, so the earlier you try and address the issue the better. Bonds in Pizza Express are selling for 84p for every Â£1 worth of loan. That means that investors do not think those lenders will get all their money back. The casual dining sector is littered with names which have been through some sort of insolvency process. Prezzo, Byron, Carluccio's needed to close stores and ask creditors to agree to rent reductions, while Jamie's Italian went bust. If Pizza Express is going to last another 50 years some sort of debt restructuring looks inevitable.  Getting it done in a brutal high street environment will not be straightforward.

PM calls on EU to 'thrash out' Brexit objections,"This video can not be played UK Brexit proposals ""very fair"" and ""generous"", says PM Boris Johnson has called on the EU to enter detailed talks to ""thrash out"" its objections to his latest Brexit proposals. The prime minister said the UK plans were a ""big concession"", but European leaders had not offered specific criticism of his ideas. French President Emmanuel Macron says the EU will decide at the end of the week whether a new deal is possible. Mr Johnson held further telephone calls with EU counterparts on Monday. Meanwhile, a Scottish courthas dismissed a callfor it to issue an order to compel the PM to comply with a law which would force him to seek a Brexit delay. Under legislation passed by MPs last month - the Benn Act - Mr Johnson must write to the EU requesting a further delay if no deal is signed off by Parliament by 19 October, unless MPs agree to a no-deal Brexit. Downing Street said the PM held phone calls with the leaders of Sweden, Denmark and Poland, after speaking to Mr Macron on Sunday. The prime minister told the French president over the phone he believed a deal could be achieved, but the EU must match compromises made by the UK. Judge dismisses no-deal Brexit challenge What is in Boris Johnson's Brexit plan? Boris Johnson and the border blocking Brexit Cross-party Brexit talks - will they or won't they? Speaking to reporters on Monday, Mr Johnson said: ""What we're saying to our friends is: this is a very fair, generous and reasonable offer we've made. ""We haven't really heard the detail from them about what they think the problems are. It's time for us to get together and really thrash this thing out."" His remarks come at the start of a key few days of negotiations as both parties try to find a new agreement in time for a summit of European leaders on 17 and 18 October. Arrangements for preventing a hard border on the island of Ireland continue to be a sticking point, with the EU calling for ""fundamental changes"" to the UK's latest proposals, which were unveiled last week. According to a briefing given to European diplomats on Monday, the European Commission was ""nonplussed"" about being asked to rule out any checks on the Irish border when it was unclear what controls the UK was intending elsewhere in Northern Ireland. The BBC's Adam Fleming said it is understood the EU was also concerned that the UK wanted to have continued access to several EU trade databases, even if Northern Ireland's Stormont Assembly withheld its consent for the new regulatory and customs arrangements. A UK government spokesperson said Mr Johnson's Europe adviser David Frost would continue talks with EU officials on Tuesday after the UK provided ""additional legal text"" on the British proposals. ""This provided further technical detail on customs and goods regulations to further clarify how the UK's proposals would operate,"" the spokesperson added. Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay will also visit EU capitals this week as part of an effort to drum up support for the PM's plans. Under Mr Johnson's proposals, which he calls a ""broad landing zone"" for a new deal with the EU: Northern Ireland would leave the EU's customs union alongside the rest of the UK, at the start of 2021 But Northern Ireland would continue to apply EU legislation relating to agricultural and other products, if the Northern Ireland Assembly approves This arrangement could, in theory, continue indefinitely, but the consent of Northern Ireland's politicians would have to be sought every four years Customs checks on goods traded between the UK and EU would be ""decentralised"", with paperwork submitted electronically and only a ""very small number"" of physical checks These checks should take place away from the border itself, at business premises or at ""other points in the supply chain"" Speaking after meeting Mr Barclay, Dutch foreign minister Stef Blok urged ""more realism and clarity"" from the UK this week. ""Important questions still remain on [the] UK Brexit proposals,"" hetweeted,external. Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar has previously said he did not understand how tariff checks could be avoided if Northern Ireland left the EU's customs union. He also raised concerns about Mr Johnson's plan to give the Northern Ireland Assembly a vote over entering into a ""regulatory zone"" with the EU. He said the views of the ""whole population of Northern Ireland"" should be represented, and no one party should have a ""veto"" over the idea. This video can not be played Last week in Brexit: The PM revealed his plan to attempt to ""get Brexit done"" Meanwhile, opposition leaders have met to discuss the prime minister's border proposals together for the first time, and to consider how they might be able to force him to comply with the terms of the Benn Act. But a planned attempt from opposition parties to pave the way for MPs to take control of the Commons agenda from next week has stalled. The move was aimed at allowing them to pass more emergency laws on no-deal, or demand more documents in the run-up to 31 October. The BBC's Nick Eardley says the idea failed to win the backing of former Tory MPs expelled from the party last month, after they decided to give No 10 more time to try and get a new deal with Brussels. After Monday's meeting, Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson said she was concerned at Labour's continuing insistence that Jeremy Corbyn must lead any so-called government of national unity created to replace Mr Johnson. She said Mr Corbyn could not command the numbers in the House of Commons to make an interim government viable and failing to see that made a no-deal Brexit more likely. Allow Twitter content?

Labour has pressed the government to publish its proposed legal text to replace theexisting Irish border backstop plan, which it has shared with EU officials. Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said the document could contradict the PM's claim, made last week, that his plans would not require any ""physical infrastructure"" to make them work. But Brexit minister James Duddridge said publishing the text now could ""get in the way of getting a deal"", adding that talks were at a ""sensitive"" stage. He told the Commons that the government would only publish the text ""when doing so will assist the negotiations"". Tuesday 8 October- Last working day in the House of Commons before it is due to be prorogued - suspended - ahead of a Queen's Speech to begin a new parliamentary session. Monday 14 October- The Commons is due to return, and the government will use the Queen's Speech to set out its legislative agenda. The speech will then be debated by MPs throughout the week. Thursday 17 October- Crucial two-day summit of EU leaders begins in Brussels. This is the last such meeting currently scheduled before the Brexit deadline. Saturday 19 October- Date by which the PM must ask the EU for another delay to Brexit under the Benn Act, if no Brexit deal has been approved by Parliament and they have not agreed to the UK leaving with no-deal. Thursday 31 October- Date by which the UK is due to leave the EU, with or without a withdrawal agreement.

Arrests as Extinction Rebellion protests begin,"Extinction Rebellion activists have begun two weeks of protests in London Police have arrested 280 people in London at the start of two weeks of protests by environmental campaigners. Extinction Rebellion activists are protesting in cities around the world,including Berlin, Amsterdam and Sydney. Organisers have blockaded key sites in central London, in addition to demonstrating outside government departments. Some have glued and chained themselves to roads and vehicles, while others were planning to camp overnight.

Organisers say they planned to remain overnight at the market to share their ""vision of a future plant-based food system"". On arriving at the market, protesters said they held a minute's silence for ""animals whose lives are lost"" at Smithfield, and then went on to set up stalls selling plant-based products inside one of the world's most famous meat-trading spaces.

Extinction Rebellion said many activists were preparing to go on hunger strike to illustrate ""that our just-in-time food system is too fragile to repeatedly withstand the shocks of extreme weather"". There had been 280 arrests in connection with the protests as of 21.30 BST, according to the Metropolitan Police. Extinction Rebellion said this included Sarah Lasenby, 81, a Quaker and retired social worker from Oxford.

It describes itself as an international ""non-violent civil disobedience activist movement"". Extinction Rebellion was launched in 2018 and organisers say it now has groups willing to take action in dozens of countries. In April, the group held a large demonstration in London that brought major routes in the city to a standstill. Read more here. Extinction Rebellion organisers say they are expecting up to 30,000 people to take part in the fortnight-long demonstrations in the capital, which form part of an ""international rebellion"". Similar protests in the UK earlier this year brought major disruption to London and resulted in more than 1,100 arrests. Up to 60 other cities around the world may also be disrupted in simultaneous events, according to a spokesperson for the group. Organisers planned to block key roads and bridges Women meditated after crowds blocked Westminster Bridge Activists will call on government departments to detail their plans to tackle the climate emergency.

Arrests as Extinction Rebellion protests beginEnvironmental activists are targeting key sites in central London as part of global protests.,"Extinction Rebellion activists have begun two weeks of protests in London Police have arrested 280 people in London at the start of two weeks of protests by environmental campaigners. Extinction Rebellion activists are protesting in cities around the world,including Berlin, Amsterdam and Sydney. Organisers have blockaded key sites in central London, in addition to demonstrating outside government departments. Some have glued and chained themselves to roads and vehicles, while others were planning to camp overnight. Extinction Rebellion claims protests in the capital will be five times bigger than similar events in April. The protests are calling for urgent action on global climate and wildlife emergencies. Watch: The farmers joining Extinction Rebellion In pictures: Global climate strike Activists barricaded themselves to vehicles in Westminster early on Monday as the demonstrations got under way. Meanwhile, hundreds of campaigners filled Trafalgar Square and blocked Lambeth and Westminster bridges. A hearse containing a coffin with the plaque Our Future was parked in Trafalgar Square, with the driver attaching himself to the steering wheel with a bicycle lock. The driver of the funeral car attached himself to the steering wheel with a bicycle lock Extinction Rebellion said a police officer later gave the hearse a parking ticket. Allow Twitter content?

He said: ""People have been saying to me, it doesn't make a difference having a celebrity joining the protests. ""I am confident these protests are going to lead to a solid change. Extinction Rebellion isn't going to go away."" In June, Sir Mark resigned as an associate artist at the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC) over its partnership with BP, which the theatre company has since vowed to end. He told the crowds Greta Thunberg, the teenage climate change activist, had inspired his decision to quit the RSC when he did. Meanwhile, activists from Animal Rebellion, a movement allied to Extinction Rebellion, marched from Russell Square to Smithfield Meat Market. Organisers say they planned to remain overnight at the market to share their ""vision of a future plant-based food system"". On arriving at the market, protesters said they held a minute's silence for ""animals whose lives are lost"" at Smithfield, and then went on to set up stalls selling plant-based products inside one of the world's most famous meat-trading spaces.

There had been 280 arrests in connection with the protests as of 21.30 BST, according to the Metropolitan Police. Extinction Rebellion said this included Sarah Lasenby, 81, a Quaker and retired social worker from Oxford.

Extinction Rebellion was launched in 2018 and organisers say it now has groups willing to take action in dozens of countries. In April, the group held a large demonstration in London that brought major routes in the city to a standstill. Read more here. Extinction Rebellion organisers say they are expecting up to 30,000 people to take part in the fortnight-long demonstrations in the capital, which form part of an ""international rebellion"". Similar protests in the UK earlier this year brought major disruption to London and resulted in more than 1,100 arrests. Up to 60 other cities around the world may also be disrupted in simultaneous events, according to a spokesperson for the group. Organisers planned to block key roads and bridges Women meditated after crowds blocked Westminster Bridge Activists will call on government departments to detail their plans to tackle the climate emergency.

"Pizza Express set for talks over Â£1bn debt pileThe restaurant chain is not in imminent danger, but a debt restructuring looks inevitable.Business","Pizza Express has reportedly hired financial advisers ahead of a meeting with lenders to review its debt situation. The 470-store chain made losses for the last two years as its operating profits were more than offset by high interest payments on its Â£1.1bn debt pile. Sales in the UK and in its 150 overseas restaurants both fell last year. Founded in 1965, Pizza Express employs 14,000 people and is now owned by Chinese private investment firm Hony. The Chinese company bought it from UK private equity firm Cinven in 2014. Few companies emerge from private equity deals without being laden with borrowing. Interestingly, Pizza Express uses exactly the same font and layout for its financial statements as it does for its menus. Unlike the menu, however, there are some quite unappetising items in its financials. Most off-putting of all, of course, is the enormous debt number. The interest on that Â£1.1bn is costing the company Â£93m a year, which wiped out all its operating profit last year - and then some. In fact, the debt payments have pushed Pizza Express into the red for the last two years with a loss of Â£55m last year alone. The frustrating thing for the business is that it is making a reasonable amount of cash. It's for that reason, its auditors were happy to conclude the chain is a viable going concern when it signed off its accounts in April this year despite the company's debts being worth more than its assets. To be clear, Pizza Express is not in imminent danger of going bust. It has until 2021 before it needs to start paying back Â£600m to its outside creditors. (The other Â£500m is a loan from its Chinese owners). But debt is a serial company killer - just ask Carillion or Thomas Cook. It can suffocate a company, so the earlier you try and address the issue the better. Bonds in Pizza Express are selling for 84p for every Â£1 worth of loan. That means that investors do not think those lenders will get all their money back. The casual dining sector is littered with names which have been through some sort of insolvency process. Prezzo, Byron, Carluccio's needed to close stores and ask creditors to agree to rent reductions, while Jamie's Italian went bust. If Pizza Express is going to last another 50 years some sort of debt restructuring looks inevitable.  Getting it done in a brutal high street environment will not be straightforward.

"No 'favouritism' over Johnson links, Arcuri says","This video can not be played Jennifer Arcuri: ""I'm not going to put myself in a position where you can weaponise my answer"" A US businesswoman at the centre of a row over whether Boris Johnson failed to declare a conflict of interest says he never showed her ""any favouritism"". Jennifer Arcuri also refused to say whether the pair had an intimate relationship when he was London mayor. Ms Arcuri told ITV's Good Morning Britain that Mr Johnson spoke at events she ran and came to her flat - also her office - ""a handful"" of times. The PM denied breaking any rules of conduct, but would not comment further. He has insisted everything was done ""entirely in the proper way"". But Labour's shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, said Mr Johnson - who served as mayor between 2008 and 2016 - ""had a duty"" to declare their friendship. ""Regardless of the exact nature of his relationship with [Ms] Arcuri, it is clear that she and Boris Johnson were close, and that he misled the public when he said there was no interest to declare,"" he added. Jennifer Arcuri and Boris Johnson: What's the story about? Boris Johnson denies wrongdoing over Arcuri link Johnson 'must address conflict of interest claims' The code governing conduct at London City Hall states that public office holders should not act in any way to gain benefits for families or friends, and should declare private interests to resolve any conflicts. But speaking after Ms Arcuri's interview, Mr Johnson said he had not broken the code, adding: ""I think I have said everything I am going to say on that matter."" The story first emerged in the Sunday Times, with claims technology entrepreneur Ms Arcuri had joined trade missions led by Mr Johnson and received thousands of pounds in public money. It is understood she attended events on two of the trade missions - to New York and Tel Aviv - despite not officially qualifying for them as a delegate. The newspaper reported that one of her businesses received Â£10,000 and Â£1,500 in sponsorship money from a mayoral organisation when Mr Johnson was mayor, as well as a Â£15,000 government grant for foreign entrepreneurs to build businesses in Britain. The newspaper claimed she had received favourable treatment due to her friendship with Mr Johnson. But Ms Arcuri insisted he was just ""a really good friend"", and ""categorically"" had ""nothing to do with my other achievements"". ""Boris never, ever gave me favouritism. Never once did I ask him for a favour. Never once did he write a letter of recommendation for me. He didn't know about my asking to go to trips,"" she told ITV. The current London Mayor, Sadiq Khan, has launched an investigation into the allegations at City Hall, and the Greater London Authority's Oversight Committee has given Mr Johnson 14 days - ending this week - to explain his relationship. Mr Johnson has also been referred to the police watchdog, who will consider whether there are grounds to investigate the prime minister for the criminal offence of misconduct in public office. This video can not be played Boris Johnson: 'Everything has been done with full propriety' Asked repeatedly on the ITV breakfast programme whether she was having an affair with Mr Johnson when he was mayor, Ms Arcuri refused to answer. ""I am not going to be putting myself in a position for you to weaponise my answer,"" she said. She did confirm he had visited her home - which was also her office - ""five, 10, a handful of times"", but added: ""It's really not anyone's business what private life we had."" They had tried to meet in public, she went on, but it ""became too much of a mob show"". ""So I said 'you just have to come to my office.'"" On the issue of trade missions, Ms Arcuri said she had access because of the work she was doing - not because of any relationship with Mr Johnson. ""At the end of the day, I was allowed to go on that trade mission as a delegate because of who I was,"" she said. Ms Arcuri said she had never discussed any sponsorship or grants with Mr Johnson, and asked if he had helped with any ""sponsorship money"", she said: ""Categorically no. Do you think I would waste his time talking about this stuff?"" She also said Mr Johnson had nothing to do with an additional Â£100,000 grant awarded to her company by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport in January. And she denied reports he had written her a letter of recommendation to run the taxpayer-funded Tech City organisation, promoting technology companies in east London. Politically, this interview still leaves the big question hanging out there - did Boris Johnson use his influence or seek to intervene in any way to help Jennifer Arcuri secure grants or to go on trade delegations? What we did learn was that she was most certainly a very, very close friend. Why that matters is because if there is any suggestion - or proof, more importantly - that Mr Johnson did intervene on her behalf, then he would have had to declare that she was a friend. And that is the missing piece of the jigsaw. We don't know whether Boris Johnson did seek to use his office in any way to lean on city officials to get her on those trade trips or to also get her the grants. We do know that he went to speak at a number of events she organised and we do know that Boris Johnson was on three of the trade trips she was on. So that raises the question that, in any case, should he have declared he was a close friend of Ms Arcuri's? There will be a lot of headlines about her refusal to deny they had a relationship, but in terms of the politics, the big question is still to be answered on whether he intervened on her behalf because of their relationship. Ms Arcuri told Good Morning Britain the pair shared ""a love"" and ""passion"" for Shakespeare and literature during their friendship. ""Boris is extremely personable. He cares a lot about this country, and he cares a lot about people... he is a guy you want to hang out with."" Asked whether she ever loved Mr Johnson, she said: ""I've been asked that many times. And I care about him deeply as a friend, and we do share a very close bond, but I wish him well. ""I really do want him to focus on making Britain great again."" Jennifer Arcuri describes herself on Twitter as an entrepreneur, cyber security expert and producer. She began her career as a DJ on Radio Disney, before moving into film - where she wrote, produced and directed a short film that went on to be sold at Cannes Film Festival. Ms Arcuri then brought in her tech skills to create a streaming platform for independent film makers. But it was her founding of The Innotech Network in London that saw her path cross with Boris Johnson. The network hosts events to discuss tech policy, and Mr Johnson was the keynote speaker at the first of those in 2012. Since then, Ms Arcuri has also founded another company called Hacker House, which uses ethical hackers to find tech solutions for businesses.

How our cells sense oxygen wins Nobel prize,"Three scientists who discovered how cells sense and adapt to oxygen levels have won the 2019 Nobel Prize. Sir Peter Ratcliffe, of the University of Oxford and Francis Crick Institute, William Kaelin, of Harvard, and Gregg Semenza, of Johns Hopkins University share the physiology or medicine prize. Their work is leading to new treatments for anaemia and even cancer. The role of oxygen-sensing is also being investigated in diseases from heart failure to chronic lung disease. Sir Peter said: ""I'm honoured and delighted at the news.

William Kaelin, Sir Peter Ratcliffe and Gregg Semenza The Swedish Academy, which awards the prize, said: ""The fundamental importance of oxygen has been understood for centuries but how cells adapt to changes in levels of oxygen has long been unknown."" Oxygen levels vary in the body, particularly: during exercise at high altitude after a wound disrupts the blood supply And when they drop, cells rapidly have to adapt their metabolism. The oxygen-sensing ability of the body has a role in the immune system and the earliest stages of development inside the womb. If oxygen levels are low, it can trigger the production of red blood cells or the construction of blood vessels to remedy this. More red blood cells mean the body is able to carry more oxygen and is why athletes train at altitude. So, drugs that mimic it may be an effective treatment for anaemia. Tumours, meanwhile, can hijack this process to selfishly create new blood vessels and grow. So, drugs that reverse it may help halt cancer.

Student housing failures 'deeply concerning',"Students were expecting to move into this building in Portsmouth for the new term The universities minister says it is ""deeply concerning"" so many student housing blocks remain unfinished, leaving students in temporary accommodation. Chris Skidmore is calling together providers of student accommodation, many of them private developers, to ""ensure these failures don't happen again"". He was responding to a BBC News report into how22 private student housing projects under construction have not been completed for the new term. This represents almost a third of the current private student-housing developments, according to the Unipol student housing charity. Mr Skidmore tweeted: ""We cannot allow this inadequacy to continue."" Student housing has been seen as a lucrative option for investors - but this autumn has seen a rash of accommodation projects not delivered on time. It has meant housing problems for students in places including Portsmouth, Bristol, Lincoln, Swansea and Liverpool. There have been concerns from student leaders about wellbeing and mental health when those leaving home for the first time might find themselves in temporary housing away from other students. Students feel cheated by rise in unfinished housing Bristol students temporarily housed in Wales Stress for Swansea students in building delays At the University of Portsmouth, about 250 students have had to be placed in alternative accommodation. Politics student Destiny said she had spent the past three weeks in a hotel, away from other students and with no cooking facilities. ""I've been feeling really anxious,"" she told BBC News. ""I can't concentrate on my studies."" Destiny has been stuck in temporary accommodation after her student block was not completed on time As with many new student housing blocks, the building project in Portsmouth was a private property development - with no involvement or link with the university. ""In many cases, universities have absolutely no say in how private student accommodation is run, its price, or how providers treat our students when things go wrong,"" the university's vice-chancellor, Prof Graham Galbraith, said. Much of the growth in student housing has been fuelled by billions of pounds of public money - in the form of maintenance loans for their living costs. But Prof Galbraith said there was ""no real control"" or strategic planning for private student housing. He welcomed Mr Skidmore's intervention and is calling for greater scrutiny and regulation of the sector. He also wants better consumer protection for students signing housing contracts, as some ""arrangements are incredibly one-sided"". Universities UK said its code of conduct applied only to university-owned housing - which means any private student developments will not be covered. And the higher education regulator, the Office for Students, said it ""doesn't have powers to regulate private accommodation providers"". Prime Student Living, the private housing company behind the Stanhope House site in Portsmouth, said it had ""unreservedly apologised to students"". ""We believe that we have done everything possible to mitigate the impact for those affected in the time available,"" said a spokesman. ""We will continue to do all we can to get students into the building as an urgent priority.""

PM calls on EU to 'thrash out' Brexit objectionsBoris Johnson says EU leaders have not offered specific criticism of his Irish border proposals.UK Politics,"This video can not be played UK Brexit proposals ""very fair"" and ""generous"", says PM Boris Johnson has called on the EU to enter detailed talks to ""thrash out"" its objections to his latest Brexit proposals. The prime minister said the UK plans were a ""big concession"", but European leaders had not offered specific criticism of his ideas. French President Emmanuel Macron says the EU will decide at the end of the week whether a new deal is possible. Mr Johnson held further telephone calls with EU counterparts on Monday. Meanwhile, a Scottish courthas dismissed a callfor it to issue an order to compel the PM to comply with a law which would force him to seek a Brexit delay. Under legislation passed by MPs last month - the Benn Act - Mr Johnson must write to the EU requesting a further delay if no deal is signed off by Parliament by 19 October, unless MPs agree to a no-deal Brexit. Downing Street said the PM held phone calls with the leaders of Sweden, Denmark and Poland, after speaking to Mr Macron on Sunday. The prime minister told the French president over the phone he believed a deal could be achieved, but the EU must match compromises made by the UK. Judge dismisses no-deal Brexit challenge What is in Boris Johnson's Brexit plan? Boris Johnson and the border blocking Brexit Cross-party Brexit talks - will they or won't they? Speaking to reporters on Monday, Mr Johnson said: ""What we're saying to our friends is: this is a very fair, generous and reasonable offer we've made. ""We haven't really heard the detail from them about what they think the problems are. It's time for us to get together and really thrash this thing out."" His remarks come at the start of a key few days of negotiations as both parties try to find a new agreement in time for a summit of European leaders on 17 and 18 October. Arrangements for preventing a hard border on the island of Ireland continue to be a sticking point, with the EU calling for ""fundamental changes"" to the UK's latest proposals, which were unveiled last week. According to a briefing given to European diplomats on Monday, the European Commission was ""nonplussed"" about being asked to rule out any checks on the Irish border when it was unclear what controls the UK was intending elsewhere in Northern Ireland. The BBC's Adam Fleming said it is understood the EU was also concerned that the UK wanted to have continued access to several EU trade databases, even if Northern Ireland's Stormont Assembly withheld its consent for the new regulatory and customs arrangements. A UK government spokesperson said Mr Johnson's Europe adviser David Frost would continue talks with EU officials on Tuesday after the UK provided ""additional legal text"" on the British proposals. ""This provided further technical detail on customs and goods regulations to further clarify how the UK's proposals would operate,"" the spokesperson added. Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay will also visit EU capitals this week as part of an effort to drum up support for the PM's plans. Under Mr Johnson's proposals, which he calls a ""broad landing zone"" for a new deal with the EU: Northern Ireland would leave the EU's customs union alongside the rest of the UK, at the start of 2021 But Northern Ireland would continue to apply EU legislation relating to agricultural and other products, if the Northern Ireland Assembly approves This arrangement could, in theory, continue indefinitely, but the consent of Northern Ireland's politicians would have to be sought every four years Customs checks on goods traded between the UK and EU would be ""decentralised"", with paperwork submitted electronically and only a ""very small number"" of physical checks These checks should take place away from the border itself, at business premises or at ""other points in the supply chain"" Speaking after meeting Mr Barclay, Dutch foreign minister Stef Blok urged ""more realism and clarity"" from the UK this week. ""Important questions still remain on [the] UK Brexit proposals,"" hetweeted,external. Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar has previously said he did not understand how tariff checks could be avoided if Northern Ireland left the EU's customs union. He also raised concerns about Mr Johnson's plan to give the Northern Ireland Assembly a vote over entering into a ""regulatory zone"" with the EU. He said the views of the ""whole population of Northern Ireland"" should be represented, and no one party should have a ""veto"" over the idea. This video can not be played Last week in Brexit: The PM revealed his plan to attempt to ""get Brexit done"" Meanwhile, opposition leaders have met to discuss the prime minister's border proposals together for the first time, and to consider how they might be able to force him to comply with the terms of the Benn Act. But a planned attempt from opposition parties to pave the way for MPs to take control of the Commons agenda from next week has stalled. The move was aimed at allowing them to pass more emergency laws on no-deal, or demand more documents in the run-up to 31 October. The BBC's Nick Eardley says the idea failed to win the backing of former Tory MPs expelled from the party last month, after they decided to give No 10 more time to try and get a new deal with Brussels. After Monday's meeting, Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson said she was concerned at Labour's continuing insistence that Jeremy Corbyn must lead any so-called government of national unity created to replace Mr Johnson. She said Mr Corbyn could not command the numbers in the House of Commons to make an interim government viable and failing to see that made a no-deal Brexit more likely. Allow Twitter content?

Labour has pressed the government to publish its proposed legal text to replace theexisting Irish border backstop plan, which it has shared with EU officials. Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said the document could contradict the PM's claim, made last week, that his plans would not require any ""physical infrastructure"" to make them work. But Brexit minister James Duddridge said publishing the text now could ""get in the way of getting a deal"", adding that talks were at a ""sensitive"" stage. He told the Commons that the government would only publish the text ""when doing so will assist the negotiations"". Tuesday 8 October- Last working day in the House of Commons before it is due to be prorogued - suspended - ahead of a Queen's Speech to begin a new parliamentary session. Monday 14 October- The Commons is due to return, and the government will use the Queen's Speech to set out its legislative agenda. The speech will then be debated by MPs throughout the week. Thursday 17 October- Crucial two-day summit of EU leaders begins in Brussels. This is the last such meeting currently scheduled before the Brexit deadline. Saturday 19 October- Date by which the PM must ask the EU for another delay to Brexit under the Benn Act, if no Brexit deal has been approved by Parliament and they have not agreed to the UK leaving with no-deal.

The places knife crime is rising fastest,"This video can not be played Lydia Lawrence has been stabbed twice but now helps others to avoid the dangers of knife crime The rate of knife attacks in some regional towns and cities is higher than in many London boroughs, BBC analysis of police figures suggests. Overall, London remains the most dangerous part of England and Wales - but data, obtained from 34 of the 43 police forces, shows the rate of serious knife crime offences rising sharply in some areas outside London, and outstripping some of the city's boroughs in places like the city of Manchester, Slough, Liverpool and Blackpool. Ten charts on the rise of knife crime Killed in 2019: The UK's first 100 victims ""We are suffering just as much as anywhere else,"" said Byron Highton whose brother Jon-Jo was 18 when he was stabbed to death with a sword and an axe as he walked home in Preston, in 2014. ""The whole country is suffering from knife crime, but small cities in the north like Preston get no mention."" Under Freedom of Information Law, the BBC asked all 43 regional police forces in England and Wales for details of serious knife crime in their area. Serious knife crime is defined as any assault, robbery, threat to kill, murder, attempted murder or sexual offence involving a knife or sharp instrument. In Lancashire, the figures show knife crime has doubled in five years, rising from 455 offences in 2014, to 981 in 2018. Sorry, your browser cannot display this map Jon-Jo had survived a previous attack the year before when he was stabbed 24 times with a machete. Byron, who has suffered from depression since witnessing one of the attacks, now works forSafety Guide Foundation,external, giving knife crime talks in schools across north-west England. ""Young people have a lack of respect for life,"" he said. ""The scary part is how bad is it going to be in 10 years if this generation isn't fixed."" Byron Highton witnessed one of the attacks on his brother Manchester, Liverpool, Slough and Nottingham are all in the top 25 most dangerous places in England and Wales for serious knife crime. The safest areas with less than one crime per 10,000 people include Dorset, the Cotswolds, Monmouthshire and the Malvern. In Scotland, police collect crime statistics differently, so there are no separate records for knife attacks. However, knife possession has increased in recent years, with more than 2,300 crimes reported last year. It's not just young men who are affected. In Blackpool, students Keeley, 17, and Lauren, 18, have both been threatened on the estate where they live, with knives brandished in relatively trivial teenage disagreements. ""I got threatened with a machete in a park by a group of lads when I was playing football,"" Keeley said. ""They wanted to play in our half, but we said no."" Students Lauren (l) and Keeley have both been threatened with stabbing near their homes Lauren says she doesn't feel safe in the town: ""Me and my mate were walking home and a guy came out and threatened to stab one of my mates."" In 2018, the resort had 14.3 serious knife crime offences per 10,000 people, putting it in the top 25 most dangerous places for knife crime in England and Wales, of the 275 areas which gave data. Drugs gangs, school exclusion rates, poverty, unemployment and cuts to services have all been blamed for a rise in youth violence in towns like Blackpool and Preston. Last month,official figures showed eight of the 10 most deprived neighbourhoods in England were in Blackpool. ""There is a significant issue with county lines [drugs courier] gangs in Blackpool, and from that we are seeing that means a lot of young people are carrying knives,"" Ashley Hackett, chief executive ofBlackpool Football Club Community Trust,external, told the BBC. ""We have an awful lot of children and teenagers who are living in deprivation and whatever way they can find to earn money and support households, legally and illegally, they are doing it. That includes drugs and knives,"" he added. In 2018, almost half of all suspects in serious knife crime offences in England and Wales, were aged 24 and under. The experiences of young women like Keeley and Lauren are becoming more commonplace. Last year, 15% of knife crime suspects were female and, including those attacked in domestic abuse incidents, a quarter of victims of knife crime were women. Dr Mike Rowe of Liverpool University, who has been observing police officers at work for the past six years, told the BBC: ""Girls and young women are being exploited to carry weapons because they are much less likely to be stopped and searched by police. ""The attention on male suspects may lead to the deliberate recruitment of young women."" Anti-knife crime campaigner Lydia Lawrence, who has herself survived two stabbings by two different women, agrees that gang violence is on the rise, and girls with low self-esteem are being emotionally exploited. Ms Lawrence, who's from west London, was first a victim of knife crime aged just 12, when she was cut on her face. She nearly died when she was 21, after being stabbed through her kidney and liver. Ms Lawrence, who was born in prison, excluded from school at 12 and homeless by 16, warned that girls from troubled backgrounds and broken homes are the most at risk. Dr Rowe believes police responses to knife crime have been ""seriously hampered by the cuts in the past eight years and more"", contributing to a fall in the number of cases solved. He said that every time there is a stabbing, officers are pulled from neighbourhood teams to guard the scene as forensics are gathered. ""It's these neighbourhood teams that would normally be expected to gather the intelligence which investigations of knife crime and gang activity rely on. ""So there is a vicious cycle in which rising demands hinder the capacity to investigate those very crimes."" Police hail knife crime fall in Manchester People 'scared to leave homes' over drugs Assistant Chief Constable Jackie Sebire, the national lead in tackling serious violent crime at the National Police Chiefs' Council, blamed police funding cuts for the fall in charge rates. ""The large reduction in police funding since 2010 has meant fewer detectives with less time and a bigger workload taking on long investigations, meaning it can be more difficult to get a charge. ""In some cases police have fearful witnesses, and victims who do not feel able to engage with officers or the court process. ""This means there is little possibility of a prosecution. ""Some forces who have been given additional funding to tackle violence are using that to improve forensic capabilities, so even when the victim is unwilling to proceed, police can still progress a case."" A Home Office spokesperson responded: ""We are taking action to tackle the violent crime which has such a devastating impact on our communities. ""This includes supporting the police by recruiting 20,000 new police officers over the next three years, making it easier for them to use stop and search powers, and investing Â£10m in additional funding to allow forces to increase the number of officers carrying Tasers.""

How cells sense oxygen wins Nobel prizeThree scientists who discovered how cells adapt to oxygen share the prize for physiology or medicine.Health,"Three scientists who discovered how cells sense and adapt to oxygen levels have won the 2019 Nobel Prize. Sir Peter Ratcliffe, of the University of Oxford and Francis Crick Institute, William Kaelin, of Harvard, and Gregg Semenza, of Johns Hopkins University share the physiology or medicine prize. Their work is leading to new treatments for anaemia and even cancer. The role of oxygen-sensing is also being investigated in diseases from heart failure to chronic lung disease. Sir Peter said: ""I'm honoured and delighted at the news. ""It's a tribute to the lab, to those who helped me set it up and worked with me on the project over the years, to many others in the field, and not least to my family for their forbearance of all the up and downs."" William Kaelin, Sir Peter Ratcliffe and Gregg Semenza The Swedish Academy, which awards the prize, said: ""The fundamental importance of oxygen has been understood for centuries but how cells adapt to changes in levels of oxygen has long been unknown."" Oxygen levels vary in the body, particularly: during exercise at high altitude after a wound disrupts the blood supply And when they drop, cells rapidly have to adapt their metabolism. The oxygen-sensing ability of the body has a role in the immune system and the earliest stages of development inside the womb. If oxygen levels are low, it can trigger the production of red blood cells or the construction of blood vessels to remedy this. More red blood cells mean the body is able to carry more oxygen and is why athletes train at altitude. So, drugs that mimic it may be an effective treatment for anaemia. Tumours, meanwhile, can hijack this process to selfishly create new blood vessels and grow. So, drugs that reverse it may help halt cancer. ""The work of these three scientists and their teams has paved the way to a greater understanding of these common, life-threatening conditions and new strategies to treat them,"" Dr Andrew Murray, from the University of Cambridge, said. ""Congratulations to the three new Nobel Laureates. This is richly deserved."" This video can not be played How do you they pick a Nobel prize winner? Levels of hormone erythropoietin (EPO) were shown to rise as those of oxygen fell. And the scientists discovered this was because a cluster of proteins called hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) was changing the behaviour of DNA, the genetic code. Further work showed when oxygen levels were normal, cells constantly produced HIF only for it to be destroyed by another protein, VHL. But when oxygen levels fell, VHL could no longer stick to HIF, leading to the build-up sufficient levels to change the behaviour of DNA. 2018 - James P Allison and Tasuku Honjo for discoveringhow to fight cancerusing the body's immune system 2017- Jeffrey Hall, Michael Rosbash and Michael Young for unravelling how bodies keep a circadian rhythm orbody clock 2016 - Yoshinori Ohsumi for discovering how cellsremain healthy by recycling waste 2015 - William C Campbell, Satoshi Åmura and Youyou Tu foranti-parasite drug discoveries 2014 - John O'Keefe, May-Britt Moser and Edvard Moser fordiscovering the brain's navigating system 2013 - James Rothman, Randy Schekman, and Thomas Sudhof for discovering howcells precisely transport material 2012 - John Gurdon and Shinya Yamanaka forchanging adult cells into stem cells 2011 - Bruce Beutler, Jules Hoffmann and Ralph Steinman for revolutionising the understanding ofhow the body fights infection 2010 - Robert Edwards fordevising the fertility treatment in vitro fertilisation (IVF), which led to the first ""test-tube baby"", in July 1978 2009 - Elizabeth Blackburn, Carol Greider and Jack Szostak for finding thetelomeres at the ends of chromosomes,external How do you choose a Nobel Prize winner- - BBC News LA mayor says winds and drought created 'perfect storm', while official hits out at looters Maps and pictures chart how fires have spread Biden praises Carter's character as former president's coffin heads to Georgia The '9/11 mastermind' is set to plead guilty.

Macron: Brexit deal decision 'at end of week',"The EU will decide at the end of the week whether a Brexit deal is going to be possible, French President Emmanuel Macron has told Boris Johnson. President Macron said talks should now proceed swiftly to see if an agreement could ""respect"" EU principles. Mr Johnson said the EU should not be ""lured"" into thinking there would be a delay to Brexit beyond 31 October. The PM will hold further calls with EU leaders on Monday to discuss his latest proposals for the Irish border. Downing Street said Mr Johnson was expected to hold phone calls with the leaders of Sweden, Denmark and Poland, after speaking to Mr Macron on Sunday. The prime minister told the French president over the phone he believed a deal could be achieved, but that the EU must match compromises made by the UK. A French government official said President Macron told Mr Johnson ""that the negotiations should continue swiftly with Michel Barnier's team in coming days, in order to evaluate at the end of the week whether a deal is possible that respects European Union principles"". UK could 'clarify' its Brexit offer to EU What is in Boris Johnson's Brexit plan? Boris Johnson and the border blocking Brexit The comments come ahead of a key few days of negotiations as both parties try to find a new agreement in time for a summit of European leaders on 17 and 18 October. On Monday, Mr Johnson's Europe adviser, David Frost, will hold further discussions with the European Commission, while Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay will visit EU capitals. This video can not be played Last week in Brexit: The PM revealed his plan to attempt to ""get Brexit done"" Arrangements for preventing a hard border on the island of Ireland continue to be a sticking point, with the EU calling for ""fundamental changes"" to the UK's latest proposals. A senior Number 10 source said: ""The UK has made a big, important offer but it's time for the Commission to show a willingness to compromise too. If not the UK will leave with no deal."" It's good to talk. But was there a meeting of minds between the prime minister and the French president? Boris Johnson's aim was to disabuse President Macron of any suspicion that parliament simply wouldn't allow the UK to leave the EU at the end of the month without a deal. So this really could be the 'final opportunity' to seal one. The prime minister will deliver a similar message to other EU leaders. So far, though, Mr Johnson's proposals are yet to open the door to more intensive negotiations. From the Elysee Palace's account of the call, Macron's message to the PM seemed to be: First, work through the EU negotiator, Michel Barnier - don't work on individual leaders. And second, if you don't move a bit more towards the EU's position  by the end of the week, then it's no deal. So far, then, any talks seem to resemble the denouement of Reservoir Dogs - more stand-off than mutual understanding. Under the Benn Act, passed last month, the prime minister must write to the EU requesting a Brexit extension if no deal is signed off by Parliament by 19 October, unless MPs agree to a no-deal Brexit. Government papers submitted to a Scottish court said thatMr Johnson will comply, despite his assertion that there will be ""no more dither or delay"". The Number 10 source called the legislation a ""surrender act"" and said its authors were ""undermining negotiations"". ""If EU leaders are betting that it will prevent no deal, that would be a historic misunderstanding,"" they said. Under Mr Johnson's proposals, which he calls a ""broad landing zone"" for a new deal with the EU: Northern Ireland would leave the EU's customs union alongside the rest of the UK, at the start of 2021 But Northern Ireland would continue to apply EU legislation relating to agricultural and other products, if the Northern Ireland Assembly approves This arrangement could, in theory, continue indefinitely, but the consent of Northern Ireland's politicians would have to be sought every four years Customs checks on goods traded between the UK and EU would be ""decentralised"", with paperwork submitted electronically and only a ""very small number"" of physical checks These checks should take place away from the border itself, at business premises or at ""other points in the supply chain"" Mr Johnson has claimed his plans will be supported by Parliament. At the weekend he said his untested plan to use technology to eliminate customs border checks would take the UK out of EU trade rules while respecting the Northern Ireland peace process. He claimed MPs from ""every wing of the Conservative Party"", Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party and from Labour have said ""our proposed deal looks like one they can get behind"". This video can not be played Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay is asked about the government's strategy for a law that could force it to ask for a Brexit delay Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay said talks were under way with Labour and other opposition MPs aimed at securing their support for a new deal. He said ministers were ""considering"" the idea of putting the PM's proposals to a vote in Parliament to test support for them ahead of the EU summit. Meanwhile, Jeremy Corbyn is set to meet the leaders of other opposition parties to scrutinise the government's new Brexit proposals. The cross-party meeting between Labour, the SNP, Lib Dems, Greens and others on Monday will decide the next steps to ""hold the government to account"". Monday 7 October- Opposition leaders meet to discuss the PM's border proposals. In Edinburgh, the Court of Session could rule on the sanctions Boris Johnson would face if he contravened the law compelling him to seek a Brexit delay. Tuesday 8 October- Last working day in the House of Commons before it is due to be prorogued - suspended - ahead of a Queen's Speech to begin a new parliamentary session. Monday 14 October- The Commons is due to return, and the government will use the Queen's Speech to set out its legislative agenda. The speech will be then be debated by MPs throughout the week. Thursday 17 October- Crucial two-day summit of EU leaders begins in Brussels. This is the last such meeting currently scheduled before the Brexit deadline. Saturday 19 October- Date by which the PM must ask the EU for another delay to Brexit under the Benn Act, if no Brexit deal has been approved by Parliament and they have not agreed to the UK leaving with no-deal. Thursday 31 October- Date by which the UK is due to leave the EU, with or without a withdrawal agreement.

Arcuri refuses to answer on Johnson relationship,"This video can not be played Jennifer Arcuri: ""I'm not going to put myself in a position where you can weaponise my answer"" A US businesswoman at the centre of a row over whether Boris Johnson failed to declare a conflict of interest says he never showed her ""any favouritism"". Jennifer Arcuri also refused to say whether the pair had an intimate relationship when he was London mayor. Ms Arcuri told ITV's Good Morning Britain that Mr Johnson spoke at events she ran and came to her flat - also her office - ""a handful"" of times. The PM denied breaking any rules of conduct, but would not comment further. He has insisted everything was done ""entirely in the proper way"". But Labour's shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, said Mr Johnson - who served as mayor between 2008 and 2016 - ""had a duty"" to declare their friendship. ""Regardless of the exact nature of his relationship with [Ms] Arcuri, it is clear that she and Boris Johnson were close, and that he misled the public when he said there was no interest to declare,"" he added. Jennifer Arcuri and Boris Johnson: What's the story about? Boris Johnson denies wrongdoing over Arcuri link Johnson 'must address conflict of interest claims' The code governing conduct at London City Hall states that public office holders should not act in any way to gain benefits for families or friends, and should declare private interests to resolve any conflicts. But speaking after Ms Arcuri's interview, Mr Johnson said he had not broken the code, adding: ""I think I have said everything I am going to say on that matter."" The story first emerged in the Sunday Times, with claims technology entrepreneur Ms Arcuri had joined trade missions led by Mr Johnson and received thousands of pounds in public money. It is understood she attended events on two of the trade missions - to New York and Tel Aviv - despite not officially qualifying for them as a delegate. The newspaper reported that one of her businesses received Â£10,000 and Â£1,500 in sponsorship money from a mayoral organisation when Mr Johnson was mayor, as well as a Â£15,000 government grant for foreign entrepreneurs to build businesses in Britain. The newspaper claimed she had received favourable treatment due to her friendship with Mr Johnson. But Ms Arcuri insisted he was just ""a really good friend"", and ""categorically"" had ""nothing to do with my other achievements"". ""Boris never, ever gave me favouritism. Never once did I ask him for a favour. Never once did he write a letter of recommendation for me. He didn't know about my asking to go to trips,"" she told ITV. The current London Mayor, Sadiq Khan, has launched an investigation into the allegations at City Hall, and the Greater London Authority's Oversight Committee has given Mr Johnson 14 days - ending this week - to explain his relationship. Mr Johnson has also been referred to the police watchdog, who will consider whether there are grounds to investigate the prime minister for the criminal offence of misconduct in public office. This video can not be played Boris Johnson: 'Everything has been done with full propriety' Asked repeatedly on the ITV breakfast programme whether she was having an affair with Mr Johnson when he was mayor, Ms Arcuri refused to answer. ""I am not going to be putting myself in a position for you to weaponise my answer,"" she said. She did confirm he had visited her home - which was also her office - ""five, 10, a handful of times"", but added: ""It's really not anyone's business what private life we had."" They had tried to meet in public, she went on, but it ""became too much of a mob show"". ""So I said 'you just have to come to my office.'"" On the issue of trade missions, Ms Arcuri said she had access because of the work she was doing - not because of any relationship with Mr Johnson. ""At the end of the day, I was allowed to go on that trade mission as a delegate because of who I was,"" she said. Ms Arcuri said she had never discussed any sponsorship or grants with Mr Johnson, and asked if he had helped with any ""sponsorship money"", she said: ""Categorically no. Do you think I would waste his time talking about this stuff?"" She also said Mr Johnson had nothing to do with an additional Â£100,000 grant awarded to her company by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport in January. And she denied reports he had written her a letter of recommendation to run the taxpayer-funded Tech City organisation, promoting technology companies in east London. Politically, this interview still leaves the big question hanging out there - did Boris Johnson use his influence or seek to intervene in any way to help Jennifer Arcuri secure grants or to go on trade delegations? What we did learn was that she was most certainly a very, very close friend. Why that matters is because if there is any suggestion - or proof, more importantly - that Mr Johnson did intervene on her behalf, then he would have had to declare that she was a friend. And that is the missing piece of the jigsaw. We don't know whether Boris Johnson did seek to use his office in any way to lean on city officials to get her on those trade trips or to also get her the grants. We do know that he went to speak at a number of events she organised and we do know that Boris Johnson was on three of the trade trips she was on. So that raises the question that, in any case, should he have declared he was a close friend of Ms Arcuri's? There will be a lot of headlines about her refusal to deny they had a relationship, but in terms of the politics, the big question is still to be answered on whether he intervened on her behalf because of their relationship. Ms Arcuri told Good Morning Britain the pair shared ""a love"" and ""passion"" for Shakespeare and literature during their friendship. ""Boris is extremely personable. He cares a lot about this country, and he cares a lot about people... he is a guy you want to hang out with."" Asked whether she ever loved Mr Johnson, she said: ""I've been asked that many times. And I care about him deeply as a friend, and we do share a very close bond, but I wish him well. ""I really do want him to focus on making Britain great again."" Jennifer Arcuri describes herself on Twitter as an entrepreneur, cyber security expert and producer. She began her career as a DJ on Radio Disney, before moving into film - where she wrote, produced and directed a short film that went on to be sold at Cannes Film Festival. Ms Arcuri then brought in her tech skills to create a streaming platform for independent film makers. But it was her founding of The Innotech Network in London that saw her path cross with Boris Johnson. The network hosts events to discuss tech policy, and Mr Johnson was the keynote speaker at the first of those in 2012. Since then, Ms Arcuri has also founded another company called Hacker House, which uses ethical hackers to find tech solutions for businesses.

PM prepared to raise Harry Dunn case with US,"This video can not be played Boris Johnson responds to the US diplomatic immunity row The prime minister has urged the US to reconsider giving a diplomat's wife immunity after she left the UK despite being a suspect in a fatal crash. Anne Sacoolas is wanted by police over the death of motorcyclist Harry Dunn, 19, in Northamptonshire on 27 August. The US State Department said diplomatic immunity was ""rarely waived"". Boris Johnson said the UK was speaking to the US ambassador and ""if we can't resolve it then... I will be raising it myself with the White House"". UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, who has already urged the US Embassy to reconsider, raised Mr Dunn's case in a conversation with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo earlier. A spokesman for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office said Mr Raab ""reiterated his disappointment with the US decision and urged them to reconsider"". Underthe 1961 Vienna Convention,external, diplomats and their family members are immune from prosecution in their host country, as long as they are not nationals of that country. However, their immunity can be waived by the state that has sent them. Ms Sacoolas left the UK despite telling police she had no such plans. Harry Dunn, 19, died in hospital after his motorbike was in a crash with a Volvo Speaking during a visit to a hospital in Watford, Mr Johnson said: ""I think everybody's sympathies are very much with the family of Harry Dunn and our condolences to them for their tragic loss. ""I must answer you directly, I do not think that it can be right to use the process of diplomatic immunity for this type of purpose. ""And I hope that Anne Sacoolas will come back and will engage properly with the processes of law as they are carried out in this country. ""That's a point that we've raised or are raising today with the American ambassador here in the UK and I hope it will be resolved very shortly. ""And to anticipate a question you might want to raise, if we can't resolve it then of course I will be raising it myself personally with the White House."" This video can not be played Harry Dunn crash: Family 'will travel to US to fight for change' Both Northamptonshire's chief constable and police and crime commissioner have already urged the Americans to waive Ms Sacoolas's diplomatic immunity. Mr Dunn died in hospital shortly after his Kawasaki motorcycle was involved in a crash with a Volvo XC90 at about 20:30 BST near the RAF base at Croughton. Chief constable Nick Adderley said based on CCTV evidence, officers knew that on the night of the crash a vehicle had left the base ""on the wrong side of the road"". Supt Sarah Johnson said the police were collecting evidence with support from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the RAF base and the Dunn family. ""We're going to make sure that we deal with it [the investigation] in a way that we can take it through to prosecution,"" she said. Gary O'Donoghue, BBC Washington Correspondent The appeal from Boris Johnson will undoubtedly be heard at the White House. But I think it's unlikely the Americans will change their minds. It happens on a reasonably regular basis around the world that diplomats get into serious situations and don't face the law. We understand the diplomat and his wife had only been in Britain for three weeks. On the face of it that sounds like something that has been brought to a premature end, presumably in connection with what happened. I think the slightly distasteful thing is that apparently Ms Sacoolas promised to stay and co-operate but then left. But we don't know the circumstances around that because we haven't heard her side of the story. The crash happened on the B4031 near RAF Croughton, Northamptonshire, in August Mr Dunn's mother Charlotte Charles said it was ""such a dishonourable thing to do"" for Ms Sacoolas to leave the country and urged her to come back. Ms Charles told BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme: ""[It was] unintentional. She didn't purposely drive on the other side of the road... if she'd have stayed and faced us as a family we could have found that forgiveness... but forgiving her for leaving, I'm nowhere near."" She has previously said that if the diplomatic waiver was declined then she would travel to see President Donald Trump and ""ask him directly"". The US State Department said it was in ""close consultation"" with British officials and has offered its ""deepest sympathies"" to the family of Mr Dunn.

PM given 14 days to explain Arcuri links,"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""Everything done in the proper way"" Boris Johnson has been given 14 days to give details of his relationship with a US businesswoman, following claims he failed to declare a potential conflict of interest when he was London mayor. A committee that scrutinises the mayor's spending has asked for details ""of all contact"" with Jennifer Arcuri. The Sunday Times,externalsaid Ms Arcuri joined trade missions he led and received thousands in sponsorship grants. Mr Johnson has said everything was done ""entirely in the proper way"". Ms Arcuri told the paper any grants she received and any trade missions she joined were ""were purely in respect of my role as a legitimate businesswoman"". PM defends actions over conflict of interest claims Johnson 'must address conflict of interest claims' In a letter addressed to Mr Johnson and dated 23 September, Len Duvall, chairman of the London Assembly GLA (Greater London Assembly) Oversight Committee, said he wanted the ""details and a timeline of all contact"" with Ms Arcuri ""including social, personal and professional during his period of office as Mayor of London"". He also asked for ""an explanation of how that alleged personal relationship was disclosed and taken into account in any and all dealings with the GLA"". The committee has the legal power to summon Mr Johnson to appear before it for questioning and has done once before - when it quizzed him over the failed Garden Bridge project in 2018. Boris Johnson with Jennifer Arcuri at an event in 2014 On Monday evening, when asked about the allegations, Mr Johnson told the BBC's John Pienaar: ""All I can say is I am very proud of what we did as Mayor of London... particularly banging the drum for our city and country around the world."" He added: ""I can tell you that absolutely everything was done entirely in the proper way."" Technology entrepreneur Ms Arcuri is believed to have moved to London seven years ago, when Mr Johnson was mayor. She joined a number of trade missions led by him while in office, and it is understood she attended events on two of these trips - to New York and Tel Aviv - despite not officially qualifying for them as a delegate. The Sunday Times reported that one of her businesses received Â£10,000 and Â£1,500 in sponsorship money from a mayoral organisation when Mr Johnson was mayor, as well as a Â£15,000 government grant for foreign entrepreneurs to build businesses in Britain. The newspaper also said Ms Arcuri received a Â£100,000 grant from the Department of Culture, Media and Sport earlier this year. The grant was intended for ""English-based"" businesses - although she had moved back to the US in June 2018. The Sunday Times said it had found the registered address on the grant application form was a rented house in the UK and no longer connected to her. The government has confirmed to the BBC it is investigating, but said the funds were awarded to a UK-registered company. The woman at the centre of this story is Jennifer Arcuri, who describes herself on Twitter as an entrepreneur, cyber security expert and producer. She began her career as a DJ on Radio Disney, before moving into film - where she wrote, produced and directed a short film that went on to be sold at Cannes Film Festival.

Crash death mother 'will appeal to US president',"This video can not be played Harry Dunn's mother, Charlotte Charles, and his father, Tim Dunn pleaded for the return of the suspect A mother whose son was allegedly killed in a crash involving a US diplomat's wife says, if necessary, she will ask President Trump to waive the woman's diplomatic immunity. Motorcyclist Harry Dunn, 19, died in a collision with a car in Northamptonshire on 27 August. Anne Sacoolas, who is a suspect in the investigation, left the UK despite telling police she had no such plans. Mr Dunn's mother said the family would ""do what we can to bring her back"". Northamptonshire's chief constable and police and crime commissioner have already urged the Americans to waive Ms Sacoolas's diplomatic immunity. Underthe 1961 Vienna Convention,external, diplomats and their family members are immune from prosecution in their host country, as long as they are not nationals of that country. However, their immunity can be waived by the state that has sent them. On Saturday, the US State Department said diplomatic immunity was ""rarely waived"". UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab urged the US Embassy to reconsider. Mr Dunn's mother, Charlotte Charles, said leaving the country was ""such a dishonourable thing to do"" and urged Ms Sacoolas to come back. ""We don't wish her any harm. She's a mum; we don't want to take her away from her kids either, but she's taken one of ours and she's taken my twin boys' twinship away,"" she told BBC 5 Live. Harry Dunn, from Charlton, Banbury, died in hospital after his motorbike was in a crash with a Volvo Ms Charles said if the diplomatic waiver was declined then funds raised by friends and family would be used to go to Washington. ""We will go and see President Trump. We will ask him to waive it; we will ask him directly. We will do what we can to bring her back,"" she said. If that failed, the family would campaign for a change in the law around diplomatic immunity, she said. ""It's a horrible situation we're finding ourselves in, but if we sit back and do nothing and we don't at least try to bring her back to face justice or if we don't at least try and change the laws we could never live with ourselves if this happens to another family."" Northamptonshire's chief constable Nick Adderley said that ""based on CCTV evidence"", officers knew that ""a vehicle alighted from the RAF base at Croughton"" and was ""on the wrong side of the road"". Ms Charles told the Victoria Derbyshire programme: ""[It was] unintentional. She didn't purposely drive on the other side of the road... if she'd have stayed and faced us as a family we could have found that forgiveness... but forgiving her for leaving, I'm nowhere near."" Harry's father, Tim Dunn, said: ""I'd like to think she was more made to leave by the US Embassy than [it be] her own choice.""

PM prepared to raise Harry Dunn case with USBoris Johnson says he hopes crash death suspect Anne Sacoolas will return to the UK after leaving the country.Northampton,"This video can not be played Boris Johnson responds to the US diplomatic immunity row The prime minister has urged the US to reconsider giving a diplomat's wife immunity after she left the UK despite being a suspect in a fatal crash. Anne Sacoolas is wanted by police over the death of motorcyclist Harry Dunn, 19, in Northamptonshire on 27 August. The US State Department said diplomatic immunity was ""rarely waived"". Boris Johnson said the UK was speaking to the US ambassador and ""if we can't resolve it then... I will be raising it myself with the White House"". UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, who has already urged the US Embassy to reconsider, raised Mr Dunn's case in a conversation with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo earlier. A spokesman for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office said Mr Raab ""reiterated his disappointment with the US decision and urged them to reconsider"". Underthe 1961 Vienna Convention,external, diplomats and their family members are immune from prosecution in their host country, as long as they are not nationals of that country. However, their immunity can be waived by the state that has sent them. Ms Sacoolas left the UK despite telling police she had no such plans. Harry Dunn, 19, died in hospital after his motorbike was in a crash with a Volvo Speaking during a visit to a hospital in Watford, Mr Johnson said: ""I think everybody's sympathies are very much with the family of Harry Dunn and our condolences to them for their tragic loss. ""I must answer you directly, I do not think that it can be right to use the process of diplomatic immunity for this type of purpose. ""And I hope that Anne Sacoolas will come back and will engage properly with the processes of law as they are carried out in this country. ""That's a point that we've raised or are raising today with the American ambassador here in the UK and I hope it will be resolved very shortly. ""And to anticipate a question you might want to raise, if we can't resolve it then of course I will be raising it myself personally with the White House."" This video can not be played Harry Dunn crash: Family 'will travel to US to fight for change' Both Northamptonshire's chief constable and police and crime commissioner have already urged the Americans to waive Ms Sacoolas's diplomatic immunity. Mr Dunn died in hospital shortly after his Kawasaki motorcycle was involved in a crash with a Volvo XC90 at about 20:30 BST near the RAF base at Croughton. Chief constable Nick Adderley said based on CCTV evidence, officers knew that on the night of the crash a vehicle had left the base ""on the wrong side of the road"". Supt Sarah Johnson said the police were collecting evidence with support from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the RAF base and the Dunn family. ""We're going to make sure that we deal with it [the investigation] in a way that we can take it through to prosecution,"" she said. Gary O'Donoghue, BBC Washington Correspondent The appeal from Boris Johnson will undoubtedly be heard at the White House. But I think it's unlikely the Americans will change their minds. It happens on a reasonably regular basis around the world that diplomats get into serious situations and don't face the law. We understand the diplomat and his wife had only been in Britain for three weeks. On the face of it that sounds like something that has been brought to a premature end, presumably in connection with what happened. I think the slightly distasteful thing is that apparently Ms Sacoolas promised to stay and co-operate but then left. But we don't know the circumstances around that because we haven't heard her side of the story. The crash happened on the B4031 near RAF Croughton, Northamptonshire, in August Mr Dunn's mother Charlotte Charles said it was ""such a dishonourable thing to do"" for Ms Sacoolas to leave the country and urged her to come back. Ms Charles told BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme: ""[It was] unintentional. She didn't purposely drive on the other side of the road... if she'd have stayed and faced us as a family we could have found that forgiveness... but forgiving her for leaving, I'm nowhere near."" She has previously said that if the diplomatic waiver was declined then she would travel to see President Donald Trump and ""ask him directly"". The US State Department said it was in ""close consultation"" with British officials and has offered its ""deepest sympathies"" to the family of Mr Dunn.

"Thomas Cook refund website struggles with demandCustomers tell the BBC they have tried to submit the claim form several times, but receive error messages.","Thomas Cook customers who had booked holidays with the firm have submitted 60,000 refund forms in the first hours of operation since a special website for the process was launched. The Civil Aviation Authority said the process was now running smoothly after initial delays caused by high demand. Customers had complained they had tried to submit the claim form several times, but kept receiving error messages. The CAA blamed ""unprecedented demand"" and urged users to try later. In total, the aviation regulator has to refund some 360,000 customers. It will take 60 days for people to get their money back, the CAA said. ""We would like to thank Thomas Cook customers for their patience during the peak claims period earlier today,"" the CAA said in a tweet. Allow Twitter content?

Several people told the BBC earlier on Monday thatthey had completed the form,external, but when they tried to submit it they received a message telling them ""an unhandled fault occurred while processing this flow. Please contact your administrator"". Joly Shapley told the BBC he had tried to put in his claim at 08:16 BST, but with no success. ""At 8:20 am I called their helpline and after 10 minutes I got through to a call handler who... suggested I try later. She assured me [there was] no problem making multiple attempts but told me that she was not allowed to take my claim over the phone. ""Since then I have made seven further attempts to complete this online form. Sadly, although the CAA had extra time to prepare this process it appears to be too fragile for its purpose,"" he said. Sue Nicolson said she had tried to submit her claim a dozen times. ""The 60-day timescale for refunds only starts once they have received the claim, so how much longer are we going to have to wait for the thousands of pounds we are owed for a holiday we were supposed to depart for this Friday?,"" she said. The CAA said people who had paid by direct debit would get their money back by 14 October. Anyone who bought a package holiday with Thomas Cook will be covered by the Air Travel Organiser's Licence scheme (Atol). Customers would have received an Atol certificate when they booked. This means the cost of any holiday booked with the collapsed firm will be refunded. The CAA launched the refund website as the final flight bringing holidaymakers back by emergency repatriation landed on Monday morning. The few remaining passengers who did not return on a CAA-organised flight will have to make their own plans, although those covered by the Atol scheme will be refunded. Thomas Cook refund delay 'ruined my dream holiday' 'We get our money's worth with package holidays' Thomas Cook collapse: Your rights explained CAA chair Dame Deirdre Hutton said she was ""deeply relieved"" that ""Operation Matterhorn"", the two-week operation to return 150,000 passengers to the UK after the package tour company collapsed last month, was over. ""Staff worked like Trojans 24 hours a day to help everyone, but that was only task one, now it's task two,"" she said, referring to the refund process. Meanwhile, staff of the collapsed firm have not been paid for September and have to apply for their salary and redundancy related payments tothe Insolvency Service's Redundancy Payment Service (RPS).,external About 9,000 staff in the UK were left jobless when the business failed to secure a last-ditch rescue deal.

"Macron: Brexit deal decision 'at end of week'The EU will evaluate then whether a deal is possible, the French president tells Boris Johnson.UK PoliticsComments","The EU will decide at the end of the week whether a Brexit deal is going to be possible, French President Emmanuel Macron has told Boris Johnson. President Macron said talks should now proceed swiftly to see if an agreement could ""respect"" EU principles. Mr Johnson said the EU should not be ""lured"" into thinking there would be a delay to Brexit beyond 31 October. The PM will hold further calls with EU leaders on Monday to discuss his latest proposals for the Irish border. Downing Street said Mr Johnson was expected to hold phone calls with the leaders of Sweden, Denmark and Poland, after speaking to Mr Macron on Sunday. The prime minister told the French president over the phone he believed a deal could be achieved, but that the EU must match compromises made by the UK. A French government official said President Macron told Mr Johnson ""that the negotiations should continue swiftly with Michel Barnier's team in coming days, in order to evaluate at the end of the week whether a deal is possible that respects European Union principles"". UK could 'clarify' its Brexit offer to EU What is in Boris Johnson's Brexit plan? Boris Johnson and the border blocking Brexit The comments come ahead of a key few days of negotiations as both parties try to find a new agreement in time for a summit of European leaders on 17 and 18 October. On Monday, Mr Johnson's Europe adviser, David Frost, will hold further discussions with the European Commission, while Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay will visit EU capitals. This video can not be played Last week in Brexit: The PM revealed his plan to attempt to ""get Brexit done"" Arrangements for preventing a hard border on the island of Ireland continue to be a sticking point, with the EU calling for ""fundamental changes"" to the UK's latest proposals. A senior Number 10 source said: ""The UK has made a big, important offer but it's time for the Commission to show a willingness to compromise too. If not the UK will leave with no deal."" It's good to talk. But was there a meeting of minds between the prime minister and the French president? Boris Johnson's aim was to disabuse President Macron of any suspicion that parliament simply wouldn't allow the UK to leave the EU at the end of the month without a deal. So this really could be the 'final opportunity' to seal one. The prime minister will deliver a similar message to other EU leaders. So far, though, Mr Johnson's proposals are yet to open the door to more intensive negotiations. From the Elysee Palace's account of the call, Macron's message to the PM seemed to be: First, work through the EU negotiator, Michel Barnier - don't work on individual leaders. And second, if you don't move a bit more towards the EU's position  by the end of the week, then it's no deal. So far, then, any talks seem to resemble the denouement of Reservoir Dogs - more stand-off than mutual understanding. Under the Benn Act, passed last month, the prime minister must write to the EU requesting a Brexit extension if no deal is signed off by Parliament by 19 October, unless MPs agree to a no-deal Brexit. Government papers submitted to a Scottish court said thatMr Johnson will comply, despite his assertion that there will be ""no more dither or delay"". The Number 10 source called the legislation a ""surrender act"" and said its authors were ""undermining negotiations"". ""If EU leaders are betting that it will prevent no deal, that would be a historic misunderstanding,"" they said. Under Mr Johnson's proposals, which he calls a ""broad landing zone"" for a new deal with the EU: Northern Ireland would leave the EU's customs union alongside the rest of the UK, at the start of 2021 But Northern Ireland would continue to apply EU legislation relating to agricultural and other products, if the Northern Ireland Assembly approves This arrangement could, in theory, continue indefinitely, but the consent of Northern Ireland's politicians would have to be sought every four years Customs checks on goods traded between the UK and EU would be ""decentralised"", with paperwork submitted electronically and only a ""very small number"" of physical checks These checks should take place away from the border itself, at business premises or at ""other points in the supply chain"" Mr Johnson has claimed his plans will be supported by Parliament. At the weekend he said his untested plan to use technology to eliminate customs border checks would take the UK out of EU trade rules while respecting the Northern Ireland peace process. He claimed MPs from ""every wing of the Conservative Party"", Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party and from Labour have said ""our proposed deal looks like one they can get behind"". This video can not be played Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay is asked about the government's strategy for a law that could force it to ask for a Brexit delay Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay said talks were under way with Labour and other opposition MPs aimed at securing their support for a new deal. He said ministers were ""considering"" the idea of putting the PM's proposals to a vote in Parliament to test support for them ahead of the EU summit. Meanwhile, Jeremy Corbyn is set to meet the leaders of other opposition parties to scrutinise the government's new Brexit proposals. The cross-party meeting between Labour, the SNP, Lib Dems, Greens and others on Monday will decide the next steps to ""hold the government to account"". Monday 7 October- Opposition leaders meet to discuss the PM's border proposals. In Edinburgh, the Court of Session could rule on the sanctions Boris Johnson would face if he contravened the law compelling him to seek a Brexit delay. Tuesday 8 October- Last working day in the House of Commons before it is due to be prorogued - suspended - ahead of a Queen's Speech to begin a new parliamentary session. Monday 14 October- The Commons is due to return, and the government will use the Queen's Speech to set out its legislative agenda. The speech will be then be debated by MPs throughout the week. Thursday 17 October- Crucial two-day summit of EU leaders begins in Brussels. This is the last such meeting currently scheduled before the Brexit deadline. Saturday 19 October- Date by which the PM must ask the EU for another delay to Brexit under the Benn Act, if no Brexit deal has been approved by Parliament and they have not agreed to the UK leaving with no-deal. Thursday 31 October- Date by which the UK is due to leave the EU, with or without a withdrawal agreement.

Eddie Hitchens moves himself centre-stage as the men arc around him for their introduction to bootcamp. “Hi, I’m Eddie. I’m a heterosexual sex addict… I’ve been doing Game since 2005, been coaching since 2011.”   “Game” is a multi-million pound business where men teach other men how to pick up women. There's nothing new about men trying to pick up women. But in this digital age seduction coaches are selling courses online on how to bed as many women as possible, as quickly as possible. They are part of a growing global industry linked through a network of internet video channels with hundreds of thousands of subscribers. In these videos and bootcamps, only the men are taught the rules. The women aren’t even aware they are part of a game. A game that can lead to persistent harassment on the street and dangerously blur the lines of consent. Hitchens signals to the rest of the group to introduce themselves, including me: an undercover journalist posing as a new recruit. It’s an international mix. There’s a chef from Amsterdam, a former US navy officer, a software engineer from Brazil, a computer programmer  from Dublin, and a doctor from Manchester. Then it’s my turn. “Hi. I am Michael Gibson,” I say, while fighting the psychological battle to remember my undercover name, “I am a ‘day game’ beginner who has recently broken up with my girlfriend of six years.” And, just like that, I’m deep into the weirdest experience of my life: a journey into the so-called seduction industry.   “Game” is a multi-million pound business where men teach other men how to pick up women.

This man is now in prison waiting to be sentenced for threatening and abusive behaviour towards young women. His name is Adnan Ahmed. Update: Adnan Ahmed’s conviction wasquashed on appeal after three judges ruled the verdict was a miscarriage of justice. But just a year ago, he was styling himself as a “pick-up artist” called Addy A-Game. Ahmed hung around Glasgow city centre with his fellow “wing men”, secretly filming his interactions with unsuspecting women on the street. One of his university classmates tipped me off that Ahmed had uploaded over 250 videos, including some of those he secretly filmed, on to his YouTube channel, boasting of his sexual conquests. Behind a list of controversial and provocative titles - such as “closing girls with boyfriends” and “fat girls should blame themselves” - lay long misogynistic monologues, with Ahmed giving out advice for anyone who wanted to watch. “The reason you’re doing it is to get laid,” he said in one video. “Only the brave get laid.”   This was much more than just one man’s misogyny. This was professional, complete with a sales pitch, lifestyle coaching, and what seemed a bewildering array of jargon: “infield footage”, “LMR”, “number close”, “sarging”. This is the language of what “pick-up artists” like Ahmed call “Game”. In one video, Ahmed boasted of what he called a “same night lay”. Later in the clip, he filmed a woman sleeping with an unused condom next to her. Ahmed was even posting audio recordings online of him having sex. It didn’t appear that the women knew they were being recorded. Their consent for these recordings did not seem to be much of a concern. “She’s like why are you putting a condom on?” he told viewers of one video. “Plausible deniability. They want you to take the lead. Remember this is not rape... Listen to her actions, her body… not her words.”   I tracked down two women who had been approached by Ahmed. Both said that their encounters with him had stuck with them. Beth (pictured) was walking home alone through the main shopping street in Glasgow city centre after finishing her shift. It was a dark November night and Ahmed stepped into her path. She was 17 at the time. Ahmed was 37. ""He was like, ‘oh are you Russian?’ Beth recalled. “He was mentioning when he was in Ukraine or something and he had hired prostitutes. He was saying that I’d be like ‘better than prostitutes’. [He had] just a horrible manner.” He said his name was “Addy”. He kept on asking for her phone number. He kept trying to touch her. “I’d said no countless times,” Beth said. “I gave excuses and he was like: ‘Oh it’s fine, like, just give me your number, whatever’.” Beth was shaken and thought that he would leave her alone if she agreed to give him her number. “He knew I was going to the bus stop, and he knew I’d be alone for around an hour waiting for my bus. ""So I stayed on the phone to my mum for around 30 minutes beforehand talking her through the situation, and her just trying to give me peace of mind."" Beth knew this was not just a chat-up. It felt wrong. “It’s not harmless,” she said. “I spent like the whole night kind of terrified.”   I tracked down two women who had been approached by Ahmed.

It felt wrong. “It’s not harmless,” she said. “I spent like the whole night kind of terrified.”   A friend of Ahmed secretly filmed him as he approached 20-year-old Emily, a Glasgow-based student. Ahmed then uploaded the video to his YouTube channel. Emily (pictured) only found out their  conversation was available online when I told her. Her experience is something I’ve heard from many women who have experienced street harassment. “The ridiculous thing is, in that entire conversation I’m sitting there trying to figure out a way to let him down gently,” she explained. “We don’t want to be called ‘a bitch’ for rejecting someone. We don’t want to be called ‘rude’ for just closing the interaction down.” In the video, which has since been deleted, Ahmed boasted that if he had met Emily on holiday, he would definitely have had sex with her. Or, as he put it, it would have been a “same day lay”. “That infuriates me… for him to so painfully mis-read that is frustrating,” Emily said. “Men assuming that women want to have sex with them is part of a considerably larger problem in our society. He probably didn’t think much by it, just saying this person’s a ‘same day lay’. That interaction was completely misreading my signals.”  Emily and Beth were not alone.  I made a video for BBC Scotland’s digital platform The Social on what I’d found out about Ahmed. It went viral with about two million plays online in the first few days. There was a demonstration on the streets of Glasgow led by a group of concerned women. At the Scottish Parliament,  First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she had been “shocked and appalled” by what she had seen in my report. And women kept coming forward. “This man stalked me for months waiting outside my work”... “This guy asked if he could ‘walk me home’... then got so aggressive with me”, “I told him my age and he kept talking to me. He was such a freak”. Nearly all the stories were about uncomfortable encounters. Many seemed to cross the line from persistence to harassment. Some - it later turned out - were criminal. More than a dozen women gave details to the police following the publication of my report. Within two days of the video being published, Ahmed had been arrested and charged with a string of incidents of threatening and abusive behaviour.

Within two days of the video being published, Ahmed had been arrested and charged with a string of incidents of threatening and abusive behaviour.    When I first began investigating Ahmed, I did not know that he was part of a wider seduction industry. I’ve since discovered that he is just one of dozens of pick-up artists online. They share seduction techniques and cross-promote each other’s YouTube channels. When it came to promising quick results, one group stood out from the crowd: Street Attraction. This company offered what they describe as bootcamps that would have men “attracting beautiful women within two days”. Students were promised online tutorials, follow-up guidance and one-to-one lessons on how to master their masculinity. Street Attraction had more than 110,000 YouTube subscribers. Its founder Eddie Hitchens even charged for viewing one of his secretly recorded sexual exploits. “Recording such intimate stuff in general isn’t easy,” Hitchens explained in one video. “If a girl knows that she is being filmed she obviously won’t act in a natural way and most certainly won’t allow herself to be seduced for fear of her reputation being ruined. ""Because we [Hitchens and his accomplice] wanted to capture real reactions it had to be filmed covertly. Guerilla-style.” What’s more, Street Attraction had trained Adnan “A-Game” Ahmed. The bootcamp he attended was filmed and uploaded on his YouTube channel. That is why I ended up outside the Savoy hotel in central London at a training course for aspiring pick-up artists. It was a sweltering day and I was wearing a thick quilted-coat to hide a camera and microphone. There were six students at the bootcamp and my coach was Street Attraction’s founder Hitchens. The first task was to approach a woman within 30 seconds. I, like the rest of the students, dispersed across London Bridge which was awash with uniformed police and colourful protesters taking part in an Extinction Rebellion event. Eventually, I bumped into a couple of women who were standing watching one of the spray-painted bandstands where musicians were doing a sound check. I had no idea what to say. It was the first test of the day and I was already struggling. I asked a couple of women whether this was some sort of gig. “No,” one smiled, “this is a protest.” My question was so naive that it actually worked. I was chatting away and eventually the other woman offered me a flyer. The conversation ended politely. I said my goodbyes and returned to the pack.

I was chatting away and eventually the other woman offered me a flyer. The conversation ended politely. I said my goodbyes and returned to the pack.  This is what pick-up coaches call a “cold approach”. I was told it does not matter if I fancied the woman or not. Hitchens pointed out a “target” and we were sent to approach by blocking their path.   The bootcamp students were now mic'd up so that Hitchens could listen in and critique our performance. Not that the women knew that. The irony was not lost on me. I was using covert filming to expose a group who were secretly recording women. I had to ingratiate myself without implicating myself to maintain my cover. And the approaches made me feel uncomfortable. All the time, I kept on thinking about my sister and cousins and what they would think if they were on the receiving end of the students’ advances.  Dr Rachel O’Neill, an academic at the London School of Economics, has studied the seduction industry for 10 years. “There’s an idea that seduction essentially provides a blueprint that men can follow as a way of interacting with women,” Dr O’Neill later told me. “So you’ll be given a more or less scripted set of lines, routines that you can follow. “Most training camps now will spend the majority of their time out on the streets, in bars, cafés, museums, any public space, actually practising these techniques, putting them into action. ""And that means often unwillingly drawing women into these interactions.” Some of the women we were told to “approach” looked like teenagers and I told Hitchens I thought they were too young. I am 31, and I did not want to approach someone who looked half my age. Hitchens, who was 34 at the time, took me aside to explain why I needed to be less selective. “Doesn’t matter,” he told me. “Even if she’s underage, it’s not illegal to stop someone...That was a good target.”    Dr Rachel O’Neill, an academic at the London School of Economics, has studied the seduction industry for 10 years. “There’s an idea that seduction essentially provides a blueprint that men can follow as a way of interacting with women,” Dr O’Neill later told me. “So you’ll be given a more or less scripted set of lines, routines that you can follow. “Most training camps now will spend the majority of their time out on the streets, in bars, cafés, museums, any public space, actually practising these techniques, putting them into action.

We sat on the steps of Nelson’s column in Trafalgar Square and listened to coach George Massey (pictured) tell us about the day’s lesson on “LMR”. LMR stands for “last minute resistance” to sex. It is regarded by the pick-up artists as a women’s token attempt to reject sex - an obstacle to be overcome. “You have to be the one to lead,” Massey explained. “The whole vibe is you take responsibility for it. ‘Yeah, I know, I am just an animal I couldn’t resist’” In one of his videos, Hitchens stated that you should “carry on escalating” if a girl says that you are “going too fast”. Hitchens then goes on to say: “If she says, we’ll definitely have sex next time, you can reply with: Why waste time? It’s arrogant to assume that there will be a next time.” “There’s an idea with LMR that women put up a certain amount of supposedly token resistance prior to having sex,” explained Dr Rachel O’Neill. “And this is something, again, under seduction logic that women do as a way of trying to safeguard their reputation. And the thing that’s really worrying about this is that it creates a situation in which a woman’s ‘no’ can never be legitimately heard as a no.” Massey introduced us to the next coach Richard Hood. Massey called him the “King of LMR”. Hood sounded more like a high-pressure salesman than someone genuinely interested in what a woman might want. “When you get to the apartment tell her to take her shoes off – as soon as you walk through the front door – you start taking your shoes off, it’s basically the first part of escalation,” he told us. “Some girls can be annoying. If they are already in their shoes and their jacket they’ll be like ‘okay, okay, that’s enough for tonight… we will leave the rest for next time’...Obviously that’s frustrating” He told us that men can be too preoccupied with consent. “Sometimes guys are a bit too shy or a bit too scared to keep pushing forward [be]cause they [men] want like… they want so much consent. I mean that they want lots of like… a written permission slip from her like, you know, ‘it’s okay that we go all the way’. ‘Cause it’s a nuance, obviously, you have to… you have to feel out the right moment, and sometimes it is your job to push things forward and lead.” I asked criminal barrister Kate Parker for her professional opinion on teaching men how to overcome last minute resistance to sex and showed her some of the coaches’ videos. “I think it’s really troubling, because it’s encouraging these young men to bypass any red flags that are put up by these women and that they should be sensitive to and alert to, and responding to,” she told me. “From what I’ve seen, there doesn’t seem to be any sexual offences there, yet. But the more they teach last minute resistance, and the more they teach these young men to ignore any signs of lack of consent, the closer we’re getting to sexual offence territory.” The head of Rape Crisis Scotland, Sandy Brindley, told me: “I think pick-up artists are really doing men no favours at all recommending these techniques... And my advice would be this, this is not the approach to take because you could end up facing very, very serious consequences.”     Day two of the bootcamp.

And my advice would be this, this is not the approach to take because you could end up facing very, very serious consequences.”   Five months after the bootcamp and I was back in London - this time as a BBC journalist to challenge the pick-up coaches I had met. After weeks of refusing to engage with me, I found Eddie Hitchens coaching another group of men. I asked why he pressurised women into having sex. He was outraged. “That’s completely wrong,” he said. “That’s completely wrong. You have twisted it completely out of  context… Bro. It’s an art. It’s an art... It’s completely consensual. ""We actually help men…so if anything we help prevent rape culture to help prevent them get involved in anything illegal or non-consensual.” Richard Hood denied teaching men how to pressurise women into having sex and said all the women were recorded with their consent.    “We never film girls. We’ve had actresses,” he told me. So you’ve done nothing wrong? “Correct” And you don’t think you’re breaking the law? “Of course not.” After I spoke to Richard Hood, Street Attraction deleted the secretly filmed video I questioned him about. Then, shortly before my documentary film was to be broadcast, YouTube removed more than a hundred videos posted by Street Attraction. A YouTube spokesperson told me the platform had “terminated the channels Addy A Game and Street Attraction. ""YouTube strictly prohibits explicit sexual, graphic or harassing content. ""Nothing is more important than protecting the safety of our community, and we will continue to review and refine our policies  in this area.” Another Street Attraction coach called George Massey later told me he saw his role as “helping people in the dating field”. If he has ever said anything inappropriate to a man seeking support, he said, no-one has ever told him. He said he gets letters of thanks from men who are now in healthy relationships. He added: “I don't claim to be impervious to error”. Hitchens denied telling his students that they should approach teenagers. “Not true,” he said. “The thing that I teach is exactly this.  Find out how old the girl is before you do anything sexual, anything flirtatious… You guys are basically misrepresenting what we’re doing.  It’s absolutely disgusting and we’ll see you in court.”  Five months after the bootcamp and I was back in London - this time as a BBC journalist to challenge the pick-up coaches I had met.

One 18-year-old victim who gave evidence described being stopped in a shopping centre by Ahmed, who is now 38. “He put his hand on my back, at my waist. He put his hand on my cheek and tried to kiss me. I threw my hands up and asked him what he was doing. There was no conversation at all. Then I asked a member of the public if I could stand next to them because I felt vulnerable and isolated. He was bigger than me so I was scared to cause a scene.” Giving evidence, Ahmed said his approaches to women were harmless and said that he stopped as soon as he found out if they were 17 or younger. The jury disagreed. Ahmed was convicted of five charges of threatening and abusive behaviour and was remanded in custody for sentence. He had already spent nine months on remand in jail. While the case was going on, Rita was at court to support the women. She was one of the women who had blown the whistle on Ahmed’s activities, and it was her call to the BBC that set me off investigating A-Game. Rita had thought she knew “Addy”. They were both students at college in Glasgow where they were studying towards a degree in social work. They both lived in the Glasgow area, they shared a car pool to class. That was until Ahmed missed a day of college, giving one of Rita’s classmates the opportunity to show the rest of the car pool exactly what Addy got up to in his spare time. Rita was shown a series of images of Ahmed with half-naked women from his Instagram account and YouTube channel. “I was kind of in floods of tears and thinking, what is this, is he like a pimp or is this a prostitution ring?” she said. “I started looking at the videos and I just felt sick. I felt physically sick. It wasn’t about how to chat up a girl, it was much darker, much darker. They [the women in his videos] don’t know they’re being filmed. They don’t know they’re being recorded. So, right from the off it’s seedy, it’s underhand.” This is the era of #MeToo. Women are fighting back against male harassment. Women like Rita, Beth and Emily are finally being listened to. “I’ve realised, you know, it’s a universal problem” said Rita. “I just want women and young girls to be aware that there are these predatory men, in our colleges and in our workplaces.""

She was one of the women who had blown the whistle on Ahmed’s activities, and it was her call to the BBC that set me off investigating A-Game. Rita had thought she knew “Addy”. They were both students at college in Glasgow where they were studying towards a degree in social work. They both lived in the Glasgow area, they shared a car pool to class. That was until Ahmed missed a day of college, giving one of Rita’s classmates the opportunity to show the rest of the car pool exactly what Addy got up to in his spare time. Rita was shown a series of images of Ahmed with half-naked women from his Instagram account and YouTube channel. “I was kind of in floods of tears and thinking, what is this, is he like a pimp or is this a prostitution ring?” she said. “I started looking at the videos and I just felt sick. I felt physically sick. It wasn’t about how to chat up a girl, it was much darker, much darker. They [the women in his videos] don’t know they’re being filmed. They don’t know they’re being recorded. So, right from the off it’s seedy, it’s underhand.” This is the era of #MeToo. Women are fighting back against male harassment. Women like Rita, Beth and Emily are finally being listened to. “I’ve realised, you know, it’s a universal problem” said Rita. “I just want women and young girls to be aware that there are these predatory men, in our colleges and in our workplaces.""

US 'should reconsider' immunity to crash suspect,"This video can not be played Boris Johnson responds to the US diplomatic immunity row The prime minister has urged the US to reconsider giving a diplomat's wife immunity after she left the UK despite being a suspect in a fatal crash. Anne Sacoolas is wanted by police over the death of motorcyclist Harry Dunn, 19, in Northamptonshire on 27 August. The US State Department said diplomatic immunity was ""rarely waived"". Boris Johnson said the UK was speaking to the US ambassador and ""if we can't resolve it then... I will be raising it myself with the White House"". UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, who has already urged the US Embassy to reconsider, raised Mr Dunn's case in a conversation with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo earlier. A spokesman for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office said Mr Raab ""reiterated his disappointment with the US decision and urged them to reconsider"". Underthe 1961 Vienna Convention,external, diplomats and their family members are immune from prosecution in their host country, as long as they are not nationals of that country. However, their immunity can be waived by the state that has sent them. Ms Sacoolas left the UK despite telling police she had no such plans. Harry Dunn, 19, died in hospital after his motorbike was in a crash with a Volvo Speaking during a visit to a hospital in Watford, Mr Johnson said: ""I think everybody's sympathies are very much with the family of Harry Dunn and our condolences to them for their tragic loss. ""I must answer you directly, I do not think that it can be right to use the process of diplomatic immunity for this type of purpose. ""And I hope that Anne Sacoolas will come back and will engage properly with the processes of law as they are carried out in this country. ""That's a point that we've raised or are raising today with the American ambassador here in the UK and I hope it will be resolved very shortly. ""And to anticipate a question you might want to raise, if we can't resolve it then of course I will be raising it myself personally with the White House."" This video can not be played Harry Dunn crash: Family 'will travel to US to fight for change' Both Northamptonshire's chief constable and police and crime commissioner have already urged the Americans to waive Ms Sacoolas's diplomatic immunity. Mr Dunn died in hospital shortly after his Kawasaki motorcycle was involved in a crash with a Volvo XC90 at about 20:30 BST near the RAF base at Croughton. Chief constable Nick Adderley said based on CCTV evidence, officers knew that on the night of the crash a vehicle had left the base ""on the wrong side of the road"". Supt Sarah Johnson said the police were collecting evidence with support from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the RAF base and the Dunn family. ""We're going to make sure that we deal with it [the investigation] in a way that we can take it through to prosecution,"" she said. Gary O'Donoghue, BBC Washington Correspondent The appeal from Boris Johnson will undoubtedly be heard at the White House. But I think it's unlikely the Americans will change their minds. It happens on a reasonably regular basis around the world that diplomats get into serious situations and don't face the law. We understand the diplomat and his wife had only been in Britain for three weeks. On the face of it that sounds like something that has been brought to a premature end, presumably in connection with what happened. I think the slightly distasteful thing is that apparently Ms Sacoolas promised to stay and co-operate but then left. But we don't know the circumstances around that because we haven't heard her side of the story. The crash happened on the B4031 near RAF Croughton, Northamptonshire, in August Mr Dunn's mother Charlotte Charles said it was ""such a dishonourable thing to do"" for Ms Sacoolas to leave the country and urged her to come back. Ms Charles told BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme: ""[It was] unintentional. She didn't purposely drive on the other side of the road... if she'd have stayed and faced us as a family we could have found that forgiveness... but forgiving her for leaving, I'm nowhere near."" She has previously said that if the diplomatic waiver was declined then she would travel to see President Donald Trump and ""ask him directly"". The US State Department said it was in ""close consultation"" with British officials and has offered its ""deepest sympathies"" to the family of Mr Dunn.

PM denies wrongdoing over Arcuri,"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: 'Everything has been done with full propriety' Boris Johnson says there was ""no interest to declare"" regarding links with US businesswoman Jennifer Arcuri. It is alleged Ms Arcuri received favourable treatment due to her friendship with Mr Johnson. The police watchdog are deciding whether to investigate the prime minister for a potential criminal offence of misconduct in public office while he was London mayor. Mr Johnson said everything had been done ""with full propriety"". The allegations,first reported in the Sunday Times,external, claim Ms Arcuri joined trade missions led by Mr Johnson when he was mayor of London and that her company received several thousand pounds in sponsorship grants. The paper has also reported Ms Arcuri told four friends that she had an affair with Mr Johnson while he was mayor of London. On Friday, the Greater London Authority's monitoring officer referred the prime minister to the Independent Office of Police Conduct (IOPC) - whose job it is to oversee the conduct of the mayor and other members of the GLA. PM defends actions over conflict of interest claims PM will explain Jennifer Arcuri links to City Hall PM's referral to watchdog 'politically motivated' Asked on the Andrew Marr show if he had declared any interest, Mr Johnson said ""there was no interest to declare"". ""I was proud of everything I did as mayor of London,"" he added. He also attacked Sadiq Khan, the current mayor of London, saying the Labour politician ""could possibly spend more time investing in police officers than he is investing in press officers and peddling this kind of stuff"". Mr Johnson added that someone in his position ""expects a lot of shot and shell"". The woman at the centre of this story is Jennifer Arcuri, who describes herself on Twitter as an entrepreneur, cyber security expert and producer. She began her career as a DJ on Radio Disney, before moving into film - where she wrote, produced and directed a short film that went on to be sold at Cannes Film Festival. Ms Arcuri then brought in her tech skills to create a streaming platform for independent film makers. But it was her founding of The Innotech Network in London that saw her path cross with Boris Johnson. The network hosts events to discuss tech policy, and Mr Johnson was the keynote speaker at the first of those in 2012. Since then, Ms Arcuri has also founded another company called Hacker House, which uses ethical hackers to find tech solutions for businesses. Speaking on Sky News, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the prime minister did not have questions to answer regarding alleged links with the US businesswoman. ""Any monies involved went through proper due process - this was a long time ago. ""Of course, in politics, there is always squalls and there are always debates about individuals."" But Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the GLA's monitoring officer had made a ""wholly independent assessment"" and decided there were ""serious questions to answer"". In a letter to Mr Johnson, the monitoring officer set out their reasons for referring the matter to the police watchdog. ""During this time [2008 - 2016] it has been brought to my attention that you maintained a friendship with Ms Jennifer Arcuri and as a result of that friendship allowed Ms Arcuri to participate in trade missions and receive sponsorship monies in circumstances when she and her companies could not have expected otherwise to receive those benefits,"" it said. The monitoring officer said it had referred the PM to the IOPC ""so it can assess whether or not it is necessary to investigate the former mayor of London for the criminal offence of misconduct in public office"". It said it had recorded a ""conduct matter"" against Mr Johnson, which happens when there is information that indicates a criminal offence may have been committed. But it does not mean that a criminal offence is proved in any way, the monitoring officer added.

'Are you a Protestant Rasta or a Catholic Rasta?'A new BBC Scotland documentary explores what it's like to be black and Scottish.,"Yasmin and Stewart Kyasimire If you are black and you grew up in Scotland, how are you supposed to feel? Black? Scottish? Or Both? Filmmaker Stewart Kyasimire wanted to understand how his eight-year-old daughter might see herself fitting into Scottish life. Born and bred here, she is immersed in Scottish culture. But having grown up in the 1980s, with few black and Scottish role models, Stewart knew his experience was very different to what Yasmin's will be. He asked prominent black Scots from three generations what it means to be black and Scottish. Their answers feature in a newBBC Scotland documentary, which reveals how growing up black in Scotland, for a lot of people, meant feeling like the only black person in the world. For Scotland's first Rasta councillor, who views himself as black, Scottish and Rastafarian, race was less important to his peers than the football team he supports. Speaking of Glasgow's black history, Graham Campbell says: ""We are like walking exhibits in a crime scene"" SNP councillor Graham Campbell recounts peculiar questioning in his home city of Glasgow. He said: ""I have often been asked the stupid Rangers - Celtic question: 'Are you Protestant Rasta or a Catholic Rasta?'"" Mr Campbell is bringing more prominence to Black History Month at events in the city. He has worked to highlightthe role of the slave trade in his city's history. He said: ""If you have a slavery name, it's inherited from the ancestors who were owned and enslaved by the people who owned these plantations. I knew Scotsmen had done that. We are like the walking exhibits in a crime scene as the evidence Scotland had that colonial past."" Comedian Bruce Fummey said he had to ""prove"" he was Scottish Actors, TV personalities, academics, sportsmen and social media stars all said they stood out in a predominantly white country. Comedian Bruce Fummey, from Perth, said: ""You had to prove you were Scottish. You were always challenged - 'but where are youreallyfrom?'- they'd ask."" Pride and prejudice: Scotland's complicated black history Filmmaker Stewart said the most common thing he heard when he went anywhere with his Scottish accent was: ""I didn't know there were black people in Scotland."" According tothe last census,,externalAfrican, Caribbean or Black groups made up 1% (about 36,000) of the population of Scotland, an increase of 28,000 people since 2001. Mixed or multiple ethnic groups represented 0.4% (20,000) and other ethnic groups 0.3% (14,000) of the total population. Ncuti Gatwa felt like the only black man in the world growing up in the East of Scotland Ncuti Gatwa, actor and star of Netflix hit series Sex Education, grew up in Dunfermline and Edinburgh after moving to Scotland from Rwanda in 1994. He said his mother walked around Edinburgh thinking that ""everyone looked the same"". He jokes about growing up the odd one out: ""When you see another black person you say 'There's another one - I must find them and I must be friends with him'. ""I'd be like: ''I think I might be the only black person in the world!'"" But he also described the devastating racism that was the norm at school. Stewart and Ncuti Gatwa from Netflix show Sex Education ""It was so normal to have racial abuse spat at you,"" he said. ""When I moved to Dunfermline, there were a group of boys who ended up making up a racist social media page geared at me. ""I came home that day and told my mum about it and it wasn't the most empathetic of responses - it was like, 'get on with it'."" Ncuti has struggled with his national identity. ""I've always been a bit scared to say that I'm Scottish because it's almost as if people wouldn't believe me. ""I wasn't seen as the same as anyone around me because no one around me looked like me. There were no black Scottish role models."" Another theme from many of the contributors was that of not feeling ""fully Scottish"" and of not fitting in. Many black Scots speak of being torn between two worlds. Jean Johansson said it can be hard to fit in Like many other mixed race people in the documentary, TV presenter Jean Johansson, from Glasgow, said it can be hard to fit in anywhere. She said: ""In Africa, I was regarded as white. ""I have never been described as white, so for Africans to see me as a white person was just weird. ""I identify most as being Scottish but I am a black Scottish woman and I am OK with that. ""To think there is anyone watching my TV shows and thinking they can be like me or do what I've done - that is everything to me - because I never had that."" Stewart's greatest hope is that by putting role models in front of his daughter, she will be able to look in the mirror and be proud to be black and proud to be Scottish. He said: ""Maybe one day she will only have to say one thing: 'I'm Scottish'.""

Arcuri referral 'politically motivated',"Boris Johnson with Jennifer Arcuri at an event in 2014 A move to refer Boris Johnson to the police watchdog is ""a politically motivated attack"", a senior government source has said. The watchdog will decide whether or not to investigate the prime minister for a potential criminal offence of misconduct in public office while he was London mayor. It is alleged businesswoman Jennifer Arcuri received favourable treatment due to her friendship with Mr Johnson. Mr Johnson has denied any impropriety. He was referred to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) on Friday by the Greater London Authority's monitoring officer - whose job it is to oversee the conduct of the mayor and other members. The allegations regarding Mr Johnson's friendship with technology entrepreneur Ms Arcuri first emerged last weekend inthe Sunday Times.,external They refer to claims that Ms Arcuri joined trade missions led by Mr Johnson when he was mayor of London and that her company received several thousand pounds in sponsorship grants. A senior government source said the timing of the referral, coming days before the start of the Conservative Party conference, was ""overtly political"". Environment Secretary Theresa Villiers said the issue had been ""blown out of all proportion"" and the complaint against Mr Johnson was ""politically motivated"". However, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn rejected the claim, saying the monitoring officer had made a ""wholly independent assessment"" and decided there were ""serious questions to answer"". PM defends actions over conflict of interest claims PM will explain Jennifer Arcuri links to City Hall The GLA's monitoring officer said it had referred the PM to the IOPC ""so it can assess whether or not it is necessary to investigate the former mayor of London for the criminal offence of misconduct in public office"". It said it had recorded a ""conduct matter"" against Mr Johnson, which happens when there is information that indicates a criminal offence may have been committed. But it does not mean that a criminal offence is proved in any way, the monitoring officer added. The reason the IOPC is involved is because the role of the mayor of London is also London's police and crime commissioner. The IOPC deals with complaints against police forces in England and Wales. In a letter to Mr Johnson setting out the referral, the monitoring officer said it related to his time as London mayor between 2008 to 2016. ""During this time it has been brought to my attention that you maintained a friendship with Ms Jennifer Arcuri and as a result of that friendship allowed Ms Arcuri to participate in trade missions and receive sponsorship monies in circumstances when she and her companies could not have expected otherwise to receive those benefits,"" it said. This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""Everything done in the proper way"" Responding to the referral, No 10 said: ""The prime minister, as Mayor of London, did a huge amount of work when selling our capital city around the world, beating the drum for London and the UK. ""Everything was done with propriety and in the normal way."" A senior government source said ""no evidence of any allegations"" had been provided by the monitoring officer, nor was the prime minister given an opportunity to respond before a press release was published on Friday night. ""The public and media will rightly see through such a nakedly political put-up job,"" the source added. Ms Villiers told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""The Prime Minister is very clear that proprieties were observed."" ""I do feel this is a distraction and it is people seeking to use the complaints process in a highly political way,"" the environment secretary added. By the BBC's Home Affairs correspondent Daniel Sandford Ms Arcuri appearing on the BBC's Talking Business programme in 2013 The BBC has now spoken to several people who went on the overseas ""trade missions"" with Boris Johnson to Malaysia and Singapore, to New York, and to Tel Aviv. They said that Jennifer Arcuri seemed a bit out of place on the trips, as her companies were much less substantial than those of the other participants, Jennifer Arcuri was originally turned down for the trip to Malaysia and Singapore, but then re-applied using a different company and was accepted. She was told her companies were not relevant for the trip to New York, but she went under her own steam and was allowed into some of the events. She was also turned down for the Tel Aviv trip, but Boris Johnson's office intervened and she was allowed to join the trade mission. She paid for her own flight, and although the organisers of the trip, London & Partners, booked a hotel for her, she settled the bill. Earlier this week, Mr Johnson denied any wrongdoing, telling the BBC: ""All I can say is I am very proud of what we did as mayor of London... particularly banging the drum for our city and country around the world."" He added: ""I can tell you that absolutely everything was done entirely in the proper way."" On Friday,Mr Johnson saidhe would comply with an order from the London Assembly to explain his links to Ms Arcuri. Separately, a junior minister, Matt Warman, has said the government has launched a ""review"" of the Â£100,000 award made in February this year to Ms Arcuri's training company Hacker House. But he insisted it had been an ""open, transparent and competitive process"".

Thomas Cook refund form launched online,"Thomas Cook customers who had booked holidays with the firm have submitted 60,000 refund forms in the first hours of operation since a special website for the process was launched. The Civil Aviation Authority said the process was now running smoothly after initial delays caused by high demand. Customers had complained they had tried to submit the claim form several times, but kept receiving error messages. The CAA blamed ""unprecedented demand"" and urged users to try later. In total, the aviation regulator has to refund some 360,000 customers. It will take 60 days for people to get their money back, the CAA said. ""We would like to thank Thomas Cook customers for their patience during the peak claims period earlier today,"" the CAA said in a tweet. Allow Twitter content?

Sue Nicolson said she had tried to submit her claim a dozen times. ""The 60-day timescale for refunds only starts once they have received the claim, so how much longer are we going to have to wait for the thousands of pounds we are owed for a holiday we were supposed to depart for this Friday?,"" she said. The CAA said people who had paid by direct debit would get their money back by 14 October. Anyone who bought a package holiday with Thomas Cook will be covered by the Air Travel Organiser's Licence scheme (Atol). Customers would have received an Atol certificate when they booked. This means the cost of any holiday booked with the collapsed firm will be refunded. The CAA launched the refund website as the final flight bringing holidaymakers back by emergency repatriation landed on Monday morning. The few remaining passengers who did not return on a CAA-organised flight will have to make their own plans, although those covered by the Atol scheme will be refunded. Thomas Cook refund delay 'ruined my dream holiday' 'We get our money's worth with package holidays' Thomas Cook collapse: Your rights explained CAA chair Dame Deirdre Hutton said she was ""deeply relieved"" that ""Operation Matterhorn"", the two-week operation to return 150,000 passengers to the UK after the package tour company collapsed last month, was over. ""Staff worked like Trojans 24 hours a day to help everyone, but that was only task one, now it's task two,"" she said, referring to the refund process. Meanwhile, staff of the collapsed firm have not been paid for September and have to apply for their salary and redundancy related payments tothe Insolvency Service's Redundancy Payment Service (RPS).,external About 9,000 staff in the UK were left jobless when the business failed to secure a last-ditch rescue deal. The travel firm collapsed in the early hours of 23 September, after failing to obtain rescue funds from its banks. An inquiry has been launched by the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee, with MPs focussing on the directors' stewardship of the company.

Psychiatry 'crisis' as 10% consultant posts vacant,"One in 10 consultant psychiatrist positions in Scotland are vacant, according to a new report, leading to claims the profession is facing a ""workforce crisis"". A census by the Royal College of Psychiatrists found that vacancy rates are particularly high in child and adolescent mental health services. More than one in six consultant posts (17.5%) in Camhs is vacant. Ministers say they have invested Â£54m in mental health services. The census found that 72 out of 747 consultant psychiatry posts (9.7%) in Scotland are vacant. In 2017, one in 16 posts (6.3%) were vacant. Across the UK, the vacancy rate is 9.6%. Professor John Crichton, chairman of the Royal College of Psychiatrists (RCPsych) in Scotland, said: ""We have a workforce crisis on our hands and need more junior doctors to choose psychiatry. ""Simply put the supply does not meet the demand."" Mind the gap: Psychiatry vacancies 'alarming' He said many psychiatrists were expected to retire within five years and there had been a drop in the numbers of psychiatrists choosing to progress to higher training. Junior doctors need to spend six years training before gaining consultant status, he added, which also contributes to the shortage. He said the Scottish government needed to do more. Charlie MacKenzie, from Glasgow, waited eight years to finally get the specialist mental health treatment she needed. The 21-year-old has autism, borderline personality disorder and complex PTSD. Her first interaction with Camhs was aged seven when she went for an assessment but was rejected for treatment until eventually being accepted eight years later. She said: ""My mental health is better than it was once was, but I still have my ups and downs. ""If I had been seen quicker way back when this all started, then I might have not had the same mental health problems. ""We urgently need more psychiatrists, especially within Camhs."" The Scottish government standard states that 90% of children and young people should start treatment within 18 weeks of referral to Camhs. However, the research found that just under seven out of 10 (69.7%) children and young people were seen within 18 weeks in the three months to June, down from 73.6% for the previous quarter and 67.5% for the quarter ending June 2018. A Scottish Children's Services Coalition spokeswoman said the country was experiencing a ""mental health epidemic"". A Scottish government spokeswoman said: ""Over the past five years we have increased the number of posts and in 2018 we saw a significant improvement in recruitment to psychiatric specialities. ""There has also been an increase of 15% (11.8 whole time equivalent) in the number of Camhs psychiatrists since this additional funding came into place in March 2016. ""We are investing Â£54m in a comprehensive package of support to improve access to mental health services for adults and children, providing funding for additional staff and workforce development.""

He said: ""People have been saying to me, it doesn't make a difference having a celebrity joining the protests. ""I am confident these protests are going to lead to a solid change. Extinction Rebellion isn't going to go away."" In June, Sir Mark resigned as an associate artist at the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC) over its partnership with BP, which the theatre company has since vowed to end. He told the crowds Greta Thunberg, the teenage climate change activist, had inspired his decision to quit the RSC when he did. Meanwhile, activists from Animal Rebellion, a movement allied to Extinction Rebellion, marched from Russell Square to Smithfield Meat Market. Organisers say they planned to remain overnight at the market to share their ""vision of a future plant-based food system"". On arriving at the market, protesters said they held a minute's silence for ""animals whose lives are lost"" at Smithfield, and then went on to set up stalls selling plant-based products inside one of the world's most famous meat-trading spaces.

"Unilever to cut plastic use to appeal to Gen ZThe owner of brands such as Comfort, Dove and Domestos says it will recycle more plastic than it sells.Business","This video can not be played Unilever boss, Alan Jope, says his firm is cutting back on plastic to stay relevant Unilever, which owns brands such as Surf and PG Tips, says it plans to halve the amount of new plastic it uses in a bid to appeal to younger shoppers. The firm is responsible for producing 700,000 tonnes of new plastic a year. But Unilever plans to slash that figure over the next five years by using more recycled plastic and finding other alternative materials. Nevertheless, Unilever boss, Alan Jope, holds that plastic is a ""terrific material"".

Why is plastic a problem? Plastic or paper: Which bag is greener? In an interview with the BBC, Mr Jope said Unilever, the UK's biggest food producer and which also own dozens of health, beauty and cleaning brands, was trying to remain relevant to younger consumers who worry about plastic use.

Arcuri shuts down Johnson relationship questions,"This video can not be played Jennifer Arcuri: ""I'm not going to put myself in a position where you can weaponise my answer"" A US businesswoman at the centre of a row over whether Boris Johnson failed to declare a conflict of interest says he never showed her ""any favouritism"". Jennifer Arcuri also refused to say whether the pair had an intimate relationship when he was London mayor. Ms Arcuri told ITV's Good Morning Britain that Mr Johnson spoke at events she ran and came to her flat - also her office - ""a handful"" of times. The PM denied breaking any rules of conduct, but would not comment further. He has insisted everything was done ""entirely in the proper way"". But Labour's shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, said Mr Johnson - who served as mayor between 2008 and 2016 - ""had a duty"" to declare their friendship. ""Regardless of the exact nature of his relationship with [Ms] Arcuri, it is clear that she and Boris Johnson were close, and that he misled the public when he said there was no interest to declare,"" he added. Jennifer Arcuri and Boris Johnson: What's the story about? Boris Johnson denies wrongdoing over Arcuri link Johnson 'must address conflict of interest claims' The code governing conduct at London City Hall states that public office holders should not act in any way to gain benefits for families or friends, and should declare private interests to resolve any conflicts. But speaking after Ms Arcuri's interview, Mr Johnson said he had not broken the code, adding: ""I think I have said everything I am going to say on that matter."" The story first emerged in the Sunday Times, with claims technology entrepreneur Ms Arcuri had joined trade missions led by Mr Johnson and received thousands of pounds in public money. It is understood she attended events on two of the trade missions - to New York and Tel Aviv - despite not officially qualifying for them as a delegate. The newspaper reported that one of her businesses received Â£10,000 and Â£1,500 in sponsorship money from a mayoral organisation when Mr Johnson was mayor, as well as a Â£15,000 government grant for foreign entrepreneurs to build businesses in Britain. The newspaper claimed she had received favourable treatment due to her friendship with Mr Johnson. But Ms Arcuri insisted he was just ""a really good friend"", and ""categorically"" had ""nothing to do with my other achievements"". ""Boris never, ever gave me favouritism. Never once did I ask him for a favour. Never once did he write a letter of recommendation for me. He didn't know about my asking to go to trips,"" she told ITV. The current London Mayor, Sadiq Khan, has launched an investigation into the allegations at City Hall, and the Greater London Authority's Oversight Committee has given Mr Johnson 14 days - ending this week - to explain his relationship. Mr Johnson has also been referred to the police watchdog, who will consider whether there are grounds to investigate the prime minister for the criminal offence of misconduct in public office. This video can not be played Boris Johnson: 'Everything has been done with full propriety' Asked repeatedly on the ITV breakfast programme whether she was having an affair with Mr Johnson when he was mayor, Ms Arcuri refused to answer. ""I am not going to be putting myself in a position for you to weaponise my answer,"" she said. She did confirm he had visited her home - which was also her office - ""five, 10, a handful of times"", but added: ""It's really not anyone's business what private life we had."" They had tried to meet in public, she went on, but it ""became too much of a mob show"". ""So I said 'you just have to come to my office.'"" On the issue of trade missions, Ms Arcuri said she had access because of the work she was doing - not because of any relationship with Mr Johnson. ""At the end of the day, I was allowed to go on that trade mission as a delegate because of who I was,"" she said. Ms Arcuri said she had never discussed any sponsorship or grants with Mr Johnson, and asked if he had helped with any ""sponsorship money"", she said: ""Categorically no. Do you think I would waste his time talking about this stuff?"" She also said Mr Johnson had nothing to do with an additional Â£100,000 grant awarded to her company by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport in January. And she denied reports he had written her a letter of recommendation to run the taxpayer-funded Tech City organisation, promoting technology companies in east London. Politically, this interview still leaves the big question hanging out there - did Boris Johnson use his influence or seek to intervene in any way to help Jennifer Arcuri secure grants or to go on trade delegations? What we did learn was that she was most certainly a very, very close friend. Why that matters is because if there is any suggestion - or proof, more importantly - that Mr Johnson did intervene on her behalf, then he would have had to declare that she was a friend. And that is the missing piece of the jigsaw. We don't know whether Boris Johnson did seek to use his office in any way to lean on city officials to get her on those trade trips or to also get her the grants. We do know that he went to speak at a number of events she organised and we do know that Boris Johnson was on three of the trade trips she was on. So that raises the question that, in any case, should he have declared he was a close friend of Ms Arcuri's? There will be a lot of headlines about her refusal to deny they had a relationship, but in terms of the politics, the big question is still to be answered on whether he intervened on her behalf because of their relationship. Ms Arcuri told Good Morning Britain the pair shared ""a love"" and ""passion"" for Shakespeare and literature during their friendship. ""Boris is extremely personable. He cares a lot about this country, and he cares a lot about people... he is a guy you want to hang out with."" Asked whether she ever loved Mr Johnson, she said: ""I've been asked that many times. And I care about him deeply as a friend, and we do share a very close bond, but I wish him well. ""I really do want him to focus on making Britain great again."" Jennifer Arcuri describes herself on Twitter as an entrepreneur, cyber security expert and producer. She began her career as a DJ on Radio Disney, before moving into film - where she wrote, produced and directed a short film that went on to be sold at Cannes Film Festival. Ms Arcuri then brought in her tech skills to create a streaming platform for independent film makers. But it was her founding of The Innotech Network in London that saw her path cross with Boris Johnson. The network hosts events to discuss tech policy, and Mr Johnson was the keynote speaker at the first of those in 2012. Since then, Ms Arcuri has also founded another company called Hacker House, which uses ethical hackers to find tech solutions for businesses.

Crash suspect who fled to US named,"This video can not be played Harry Dunn's mother, Charlotte Charles, and his father, Tim Dunn pleaded for the return of the suspect A mother whose son was allegedly killed in a crash involving a US diplomat's wife says, if necessary, she will ask President Trump to waive the woman's diplomatic immunity. Motorcyclist Harry Dunn, 19, died in a collision with a car in Northamptonshire on 27 August. Anne Sacoolas, who is a suspect in the investigation, left the UK despite telling police she had no such plans. Mr Dunn's mother said the family would ""do what we can to bring her back"". Northamptonshire's chief constable and police and crime commissioner have already urged the Americans to waive Ms Sacoolas's diplomatic immunity. Underthe 1961 Vienna Convention,external, diplomats and their family members are immune from prosecution in their host country, as long as they are not nationals of that country. However, their immunity can be waived by the state that has sent them. On Saturday, the US State Department said diplomatic immunity was ""rarely waived"". UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab urged the US Embassy to reconsider. Mr Dunn's mother, Charlotte Charles, said leaving the country was ""such a dishonourable thing to do"" and urged Ms Sacoolas to come back. ""We don't wish her any harm. She's a mum; we don't want to take her away from her kids either, but she's taken one of ours and she's taken my twin boys' twinship away,"" she told BBC 5 Live. Harry Dunn, from Charlton, Banbury, died in hospital after his motorbike was in a crash with a Volvo Ms Charles said if the diplomatic waiver was declined then funds raised by friends and family would be used to go to Washington. ""We will go and see President Trump. We will ask him to waive it; we will ask him directly. We will do what we can to bring her back,"" she said. If that failed, the family would campaign for a change in the law around diplomatic immunity, she said. ""It's a horrible situation we're finding ourselves in, but if we sit back and do nothing and we don't at least try to bring her back to face justice or if we don't at least try and change the laws we could never live with ourselves if this happens to another family."" Northamptonshire's chief constable Nick Adderley said that ""based on CCTV evidence"", officers knew that ""a vehicle alighted from the RAF base at Croughton"" and was ""on the wrong side of the road"". Ms Charles told the Victoria Derbyshire programme: ""[It was] unintentional. She didn't purposely drive on the other side of the road... if she'd have stayed and faced us as a family we could have found that forgiveness... but forgiving her for leaving, I'm nowhere near."" Harry's father, Tim Dunn, said: ""I'd like to think she was more made to leave by the US Embassy than [it be] her own choice."" Mr Adderley said he had written to the US Embassy in London urging it to waive diplomatic immunity. He said both he and the county's Police and Crime Commissioner, Stephen Mold, had called for the waiver ""in order to allow the justice process to take place"". The US State Department said it was in ""close consultation"" with British officials and has offered its ""deepest sympathies"" to the family of Mr Dunn.

Knife crime 'rising fastest outside London',"This video can not be played Lydia Lawrence has been stabbed twice but now helps others to avoid the dangers of knife crime The rate of knife attacks in some regional towns and cities is higher than in many London boroughs, BBC analysis of police figures suggests. Overall, London remains the most dangerous part of England and Wales - but data, obtained from 34 of the 43 police forces, shows the rate of serious knife crime offences rising sharply in some areas outside London, and outstripping some of the city's boroughs in places like the city of Manchester, Slough, Liverpool and Blackpool. Ten charts on the rise of knife crime Killed in 2019: The UK's first 100 victims ""We are suffering just as much as anywhere else,"" said Byron Highton whose brother Jon-Jo was 18 when he was stabbed to death with a sword and an axe as he walked home in Preston, in 2014. ""The whole country is suffering from knife crime, but small cities in the north like Preston get no mention."" Under Freedom of Information Law, the BBC asked all 43 regional police forces in England and Wales for details of serious knife crime in their area. Serious knife crime is defined as any assault, robbery, threat to kill, murder, attempted murder or sexual offence involving a knife or sharp instrument. In Lancashire, the figures show knife crime has doubled in five years, rising from 455 offences in 2014, to 981 in 2018. Sorry, your browser cannot display this map Jon-Jo had survived a previous attack the year before when he was stabbed 24 times with a machete. Byron, who has suffered from depression since witnessing one of the attacks, now works forSafety Guide Foundation,external, giving knife crime talks in schools across north-west England. ""Young people have a lack of respect for life,"" he said. ""The scary part is how bad is it going to be in 10 years if this generation isn't fixed."" Byron Highton witnessed one of the attacks on his brother Manchester, Liverpool, Slough and Nottingham are all in the top 25 most dangerous places in England and Wales for serious knife crime. The safest areas with less than one crime per 10,000 people include Dorset, the Cotswolds, Monmouthshire and the Malvern. In Scotland, police collect crime statistics differently, so there are no separate records for knife attacks. However, knife possession has increased in recent years, with more than 2,300 crimes reported last year. It's not just young men who are affected. In Blackpool, students Keeley, 17, and Lauren, 18, have both been threatened on the estate where they live, with knives brandished in relatively trivial teenage disagreements. ""I got threatened with a machete in a park by a group of lads when I was playing football,"" Keeley said. ""They wanted to play in our half, but we said no."" Students Lauren (l) and Keeley have both been threatened with stabbing near their homes Lauren says she doesn't feel safe in the town: ""Me and my mate were walking home and a guy came out and threatened to stab one of my mates."" In 2018, the resort had 14.3 serious knife crime offences per 10,000 people, putting it in the top 25 most dangerous places for knife crime in England and Wales, of the 275 areas which gave data. Drugs gangs, school exclusion rates, poverty, unemployment and cuts to services have all been blamed for a rise in youth violence in towns like Blackpool and Preston. Last month,official figures showed eight of the 10 most deprived neighbourhoods in England were in Blackpool. ""There is a significant issue with county lines [drugs courier] gangs in Blackpool, and from that we are seeing that means a lot of young people are carrying knives,"" Ashley Hackett, chief executive ofBlackpool Football Club Community Trust,external, told the BBC. ""We have an awful lot of children and teenagers who are living in deprivation and whatever way they can find to earn money and support households, legally and illegally, they are doing it. That includes drugs and knives,"" he added. In 2018, almost half of all suspects in serious knife crime offences in England and Wales, were aged 24 and under. The experiences of young women like Keeley and Lauren are becoming more commonplace. Last year, 15% of knife crime suspects were female and, including those attacked in domestic abuse incidents, a quarter of victims of knife crime were women. Dr Mike Rowe of Liverpool University, who has been observing police officers at work for the past six years, told the BBC: ""Girls and young women are being exploited to carry weapons because they are much less likely to be stopped and searched by police. ""The attention on male suspects may lead to the deliberate recruitment of young women."" Anti-knife crime campaigner Lydia Lawrence, who has herself survived two stabbings by two different women, agrees that gang violence is on the rise, and girls with low self-esteem are being emotionally exploited. Ms Lawrence, who's from west London, was first a victim of knife crime aged just 12, when she was cut on her face. She nearly died when she was 21, after being stabbed through her kidney and liver. Ms Lawrence, who was born in prison, excluded from school at 12 and homeless by 16, warned that girls from troubled backgrounds and broken homes are the most at risk. Dr Rowe believes police responses to knife crime have been ""seriously hampered by the cuts in the past eight years and more"", contributing to a fall in the number of cases solved. He said that every time there is a stabbing, officers are pulled from neighbourhood teams to guard the scene as forensics are gathered. ""It's these neighbourhood teams that would normally be expected to gather the intelligence which investigations of knife crime and gang activity rely on. ""So there is a vicious cycle in which rising demands hinder the capacity to investigate those very crimes."" Police hail knife crime fall in Manchester People 'scared to leave homes' over drugs Assistant Chief Constable Jackie Sebire, the national lead in tackling serious violent crime at the National Police Chiefs' Council, blamed police funding cuts for the fall in charge rates. ""The large reduction in police funding since 2010 has meant fewer detectives with less time and a bigger workload taking on long investigations, meaning it can be more difficult to get a charge. ""In some cases police have fearful witnesses, and victims who do not feel able to engage with officers or the court process. ""This means there is little possibility of a prosecution. ""Some forces who have been given additional funding to tackle violence are using that to improve forensic capabilities, so even when the victim is unwilling to proceed, police can still progress a case."" A Home Office spokesperson responded: ""We are taking action to tackle the violent crime which has such a devastating impact on our communities. ""This includes supporting the police by recruiting 20,000 new police officers over the next three years, making it easier for them to use stop and search powers, and investing Â£10m in additional funding to allow forces to increase the number of officers carrying Tasers.""

'Are you Protestant Rasta or a Catholic Rasta?'A new BBC Scotland documentary explores what it's like to be black and Scottish.Scotland,"Yasmin and Stewart Kyasimire If you are black and you grew up in Scotland, how are you supposed to feel? Black? Scottish? Or Both? Filmmaker Stewart Kyasimire wanted to understand how his eight-year-old daughter might see herself fitting into Scottish life. Born and bred here, she is immersed in Scottish culture. But having grown up in the 1980s, with few black and Scottish role models, Stewart knew his experience was very different to what Yasmin's will be. He asked prominent black Scots from three generations what it means to be black and Scottish. Their answers feature in a newBBC Scotland documentary, which reveals how growing up black in Scotland, for a lot of people, meant feeling like the only black person in the world. For Scotland's first Rasta councillor, who views himself as black, Scottish and Rastafarian, race was less important to his peers than the football team he supports. Speaking of Glasgow's black history, Graham Campbell says: ""We are like walking exhibits in a crime scene"" SNP councillor Graham Campbell recounts peculiar questioning in his home city of Glasgow. He said: ""I have often been asked the stupid Rangers - Celtic question: 'Are you Protestant Rasta or a Catholic Rasta?'"" Mr Campbell is bringing more prominence to Black History Month at events in the city. He has worked to highlightthe role of the slave trade in his city's history. He said: ""If you have a slavery name, it's inherited from the ancestors who were owned and enslaved by the people who owned these plantations. I knew Scotsmen had done that. We are like the walking exhibits in a crime scene as the evidence Scotland had that colonial past."" Comedian Bruce Fummey said he had to ""prove"" he was Scottish Actors, TV personalities, academics, sportsmen and social media stars all said they stood out in a predominantly white country. Comedian Bruce Fummey, from Perth, said: ""You had to prove you were Scottish. You were always challenged - 'but where are youreallyfrom?'- they'd ask."" Pride and prejudice: Scotland's complicated black history Filmmaker Stewart said the most common thing he heard when he went anywhere with his Scottish accent was: ""I didn't know there were black people in Scotland."" According tothe last census,,externalAfrican, Caribbean or Black groups made up 1% (about 36,000) of the population of Scotland, an increase of 28,000 people since 2001. Mixed or multiple ethnic groups represented 0.4% (20,000) and other ethnic groups 0.3% (14,000) of the total population. Ncuti Gatwa felt like the only black man in the world growing up in the East of Scotland Ncuti Gatwa, actor and star of Netflix hit series Sex Education, grew up in Dunfermline and Edinburgh after moving to Scotland from Rwanda in 1994. He said his mother walked around Edinburgh thinking that ""everyone looked the same"". He jokes about growing up the odd one out: ""When you see another black person you say 'There's another one - I must find them and I must be friends with him'. ""I'd be like: ''I think I might be the only black person in the world!'"" But he also described the devastating racism that was the norm at school. Stewart and Ncuti Gatwa from Netflix show Sex Education ""It was so normal to have racial abuse spat at you,"" he said. ""When I moved to Dunfermline, there were a group of boys who ended up making up a racist social media page geared at me. ""I came home that day and told my mum about it and it wasn't the most empathetic of responses - it was like, 'get on with it'."" Ncuti has struggled with his national identity. ""I've always been a bit scared to say that I'm Scottish because it's almost as if people wouldn't believe me. ""I wasn't seen as the same as anyone around me because no one around me looked like me. There were no black Scottish role models."" Another theme from many of the contributors was that of not feeling ""fully Scottish"" and of not fitting in. Many black Scots speak of being torn between two worlds. Jean Johansson said it can be hard to fit in Like many other mixed race people in the documentary, TV presenter Jean Johansson, from Glasgow, said it can be hard to fit in anywhere. She said: ""In Africa, I was regarded as white. ""I have never been described as white, so for Africans to see me as a white person was just weird. ""I identify most as being Scottish but I am a black Scottish woman and I am OK with that. ""To think there is anyone watching my TV shows and thinking they can be like me or do what I've done - that is everything to me - because I never had that."" Stewart's greatest hope is that by putting role models in front of his daughter, she will be able to look in the mirror and be proud to be black and proud to be Scottish. He said: ""Maybe one day she will only have to say one thing: 'I'm Scottish'.""

Unilever promises to halve new plastic use,"This video can not be played Unilever boss, Alan Jope, says his firm is cutting back on plastic to stay relevant Unilever, which owns brands such as Surf and PG Tips, says it plans to halve the amount of new plastic it uses in a bid to appeal to younger shoppers. The firm is responsible for producing 700,000 tonnes of new plastic a year. But Unilever plans to slash that figure over the next five years by using more recycled plastic and finding other alternative materials. Nevertheless, Unilever boss, Alan Jope, holds that plastic is a ""terrific material"". And he maintains that many of the alternatives are worse, saying: ""A hysterical move to glass may be trendy but it would have a dreadful impact on the carbon footprint of packaging."" Why is plastic a problem? Plastic or paper: Which bag is greener? In an interview with the BBC, Mr Jope said Unilever, the UK's biggest food producer and which also own dozens of health, beauty and cleaning brands, was trying to remain relevant to younger consumers who worry about plastic use. He said millennials - normally thought of as those born between 1980 and 1995 - and Generation Z, which is more poorly defined but generally considered to be those born between the mid-1990s and 2010, cared about ""purpose and sustainability"". They also worry about ""the conduct of the companies and the brands that they're buying"". ""This is part of responding to society but also remaining relevant for years to come in the market."" He said there was ""no paradox"" between sustainable business and better financial performance. ""We profoundly believe that sustainability leads to a better financial top and bottom line."" The move follows similar announcements by several other companies. Procter & Gamble - which makes Fairy and Lenor -said in April,externalthat it planned to halve the amount of plastic it used by 2030. Meanwhile, Nestle announced that it would phase out all non-recyclable plastics from its wrappers by 2025 and Coca Cola has said that it willdouble the amount of recycled plastic,externalit uses in the 200,000 bottles it makes every single minute by next year. Now, Unilever has added its name to the list of firms promising to cut back on plastic with a pledge to recycle as much plastic as it makes by 2025. But Mr Jope said responsibility for reducing plastic could not fall to industry alone. He called on UK councils to harmonise recycling policies so that manufacturers can make instructions clearer to consumers. ""If there was a standardised approach to collecting, sorting and processing, I think it would allow industry to standardise labelling and make it easier for people to segment their waste,"" he said. Unilever, which is one of the largest companies in the UK, has insisted that changing its packaging would not push up prices. Richard Kirkman, the chief technology officer for waste management giant Veolia, said plants had seen an increase in the amount of packaging that was ""really hard"" to recycle. ""Now we need to work with manufacturers to change the way they design things in the first place,"" he said. Amazon in row over plastic packaging Guide: Why is plastic a problem?

Psychiatry 'crisis' as 10% consultant posts vacantA census finds that vacancy rates are particularly high in child and adolescent mental health services.Scotland,"One in 10 consultant psychiatrist positions in Scotland are vacant, according to a new report, leading to claims the profession is facing a ""workforce crisis"". A census by the Royal College of Psychiatrists found that vacancy rates are particularly high in child and adolescent mental health services. More than one in six consultant posts (17.5%) in Camhs is vacant. Ministers say they have invested Â£54m in mental health services. The census found that 72 out of 747 consultant psychiatry posts (9.7%) in Scotland are vacant. In 2017, one in 16 posts (6.3%) were vacant. Across the UK, the vacancy rate is 9.6%. Professor John Crichton, chairman of the Royal College of Psychiatrists (RCPsych) in Scotland, said: ""We have a workforce crisis on our hands and need more junior doctors to choose psychiatry. ""Simply put the supply does not meet the demand."" Mind the gap: Psychiatry vacancies 'alarming' He said many psychiatrists were expected to retire within five years and there had been a drop in the numbers of psychiatrists choosing to progress to higher training. Junior doctors need to spend six years training before gaining consultant status, he added, which also contributes to the shortage. He said the Scottish government needed to do more. Charlie MacKenzie, from Glasgow, waited eight years to finally get the specialist mental health treatment she needed. The 21-year-old has autism, borderline personality disorder and complex PTSD. Her first interaction with Camhs was aged seven when she went for an assessment but was rejected for treatment until eventually being accepted eight years later. She said: ""My mental health is better than it was once was, but I still have my ups and downs. ""If I had been seen quicker way back when this all started, then I might have not had the same mental health problems. ""We urgently need more psychiatrists, especially within Camhs."" The Scottish government standard states that 90% of children and young people should start treatment within 18 weeks of referral to Camhs. However, the research found that just under seven out of 10 (69.7%) children and young people were seen within 18 weeks in the three months to June, down from 73.6% for the previous quarter and 67.5% for the quarter ending June 2018. A Scottish Children's Services Coalition spokeswoman said the country was experiencing a ""mental health epidemic"". A Scottish government spokeswoman said: ""Over the past five years we have increased the number of posts and in 2018 we saw a significant improvement in recruitment to psychiatric specialities. ""There has also been an increase of 15% (11.8 whole time equivalent) in the number of Camhs psychiatrists since this additional funding came into place in March 2016. ""We are investing Â£54m in a comprehensive package of support to improve access to mental health services for adults and children, providing funding for additional staff and workforce development.""

Former top Barclays bankers face fraud trial,"Roger Jenkins was chairman of investment banking in the Middle East Three former top Barclays executives are due in court on Monday charged with fraud linked to how the bank raised billions of pounds from Qatar in 2008. The Serious Fraud Office (SFO) case centres on alleged undisclosed payments to Qatar in return for cash that helped the bank during the financial crisis. Roger Jenkins, Tom Kalaris, and Richard Boath all deny wrongdoing. Former Barclays chief executive John Varley, their co-defendant in a previous trial, was acquitted in June. The SFO's criminal proceedings against the bank itself were also dismissed by a court last year. Mr Varley and Barclays had each denied wrongdoing. Mr Jenkins, 64, was the chairman of investment banking in the Middle East, while Mr Kalaris, 63, headed the wealth division and Mr Boath, 60, led the European corporate finance arm. The trio is each charged with conspiracy to commit fraud by false representation and fraud by false representation. Former Barclays head cleared of fraud charges The case centres on claims of secret payments to Qatar as part of a deal to raise more than Â£11bn ($13.6bn) from investors in two tranches in June and October 2008. It is claimed that these multi-million pound payments to investors, including to the then prime minister of the Gulf state, Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jabr al-Thani, were not property disclosed to the markets. The cash injection from Qatar helped Barclays avoid the government bailout fate of High Street rivals, including Royal Bank of Scotland. The defendants were charged in 2017 after the SFO spent years investigating the allegations. The trial is regarded as a high stakes case for the SFO, which has been accused of failing to pursue companies and individuals over their part in the financial crisis. The charges against Mr Jenkins relate to his involvement in the June and October Qatar fundraisings. The cases of the two other men relate to the June fundraising only. Monday's Old Bailey trial will start with jury selection, and the case is expected to last several months.

Socialists win Portugal elections without majority,"Portugal's Prime Minister Antonio Costa has won re-election, however he has no outright majority in parliament. With over half of the votes counted so far, his Socialist party led with 36.7% and will have to form a minority government. Mr Costa said he was delighted with the result and added that voters had shown they wanted stability. The party's rival, the centre-right Social Democratic Party, has come in second place. Portugal country profile Mr Costa said Portuguese voters had shown they wanted his party to continue its pact with two far-left parties - the Left Bloc and the Communists. He said he would govern with determination and responsibility. He also mentioned negotiations with the People-Animals-Nature party (PAN) party, Reuters reported. While the far left has been calling for more investment in public services, Mr. Costa is expected to renew his commitment to stick to euro-zone budget rules. Nearly 11 million people are registered to vote in the race for control of Portugal's 230-seat parliament. The Socialists' popularity had been hit by a string of scandals, including accusations of nepotism and a suspected cover-up of weapons theft at a military base. In 2015 the Social Democrats (PSD) won the most votes, but the Socialist Party came to power after reaching formal agreements with smaller left-wing parties. Since then the country's economy has grown above the EU average. Cuts to public sector wages and pensions have been reversed.
