"Greyballing, kill switches, lobbying - Uber's dark tricks revealed"," In just over a decade, Uber has revolutionised how we move around our cities. The ride-hailing app was a game-changer: you just tapped your phone and a cab would find you. You even paid through the app. The Californian tech company helped define the gig economy, where workers were seen as self-employed. Uber now has millions of drivers all over the world, and takes billions of pounds in fares. Uber often described the regulated taxi industry it was trying to break into as a “cartel”. But the company has been rocked by scandals. Uber drivers are fighting for their rights. And now a whistleblower has revealed the dark tricks Uber used to break into lucrative European markets. Mark MacGann used to be one of Uber’s top executives. He was the company’s chief lobbyist, meeting senior members of government and heads of state in over 40 countries. “People were almost falling over themselves in order to meet with Uber and to hear what we had to offer,” MacGanntold the Guardianin an exclusive interview (see video below). “It was extraordinarily easy to get access to the highest echelons of power and decision-making. It was intoxicating.” Now he’s turned whistleblower. Thousands of documents were leaked to the Guardian, who shared them with theInternational Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ)and media partners around the world, including the BBC. The Uber Files are an unprecedented insight into how one of the world’s most notorious tech companies lobbied at the highest level to assist its aggressive expansion into Europe. Uber raised billions in investment, using funds to attract drivers and passengers and challenge the rules. But Uber needed political support to disrupt the taxi industry. The leak reveals how undeclared meetings, high-level lobbying, and backroom deals helped Uber to get leading politicians to back their radical plans. The leaked documents cover the years Uber was trying to break into Europe and they show how much Uber was prepared to spend to get close to power. In 2016, its lobbying and public relations budget was $90 million (£75 million). The taxi wars Paris was the first European city where Uber launched. It’s also where co-founders Travis Kalanick and Garrett Camp first had the idea for the app, when they could not find a cab on a freezing cold night. Paris had a strong network of licensed city taxis with the monopoly on picking up roadside passengers around town. Uber’s arrival caused chaos. Uber billed itself as a tech firm that connected passengers with private-hire cars - minicabs - which had to be pre-booked. Except that its drivers could be summoned within a few minutes at the click of a button, right from the side of the road. What’s more, Uber’s prices were cut-throat - and there was no need to keep cash on hand. The Parisian cab drivers were losing customers and income – and in 2014 took their protest to the streets. Taxi drivers attacked Ubers carrying terrified passengers, smashing their windows and slashing their tyres. But Uber had a mantra, says MacGann: “It’s better to ask for forgiveness than to ask for permission”. Rather than bow to pressure, Uber pushed harder. In February 2014 it launched a controversial new service called UberPop - called a “ride-sharing” service, it was the cheapest option on the app and like offering someone a lift. UberPop drivers didn’t need to have a professional license or be insured as a taxi driver. It meant practically anyone with a car could become a cabbie, and many jumped at the chance. At a stroke, taxi drivers had lost their advantage. Uber immediately ran foul of the authorities, landing a €100,000 fine for misleadingly advertising the new service as a car pool. New legislation was being debated that would impose strict regulations on UberPop and similar ride-sharing services. But Uber had also begun to make friends with a young politician in his first ministerial post: Emmanuel Macron. In 2014, Macron was minister for the economy and digital affairs, and a rising star. He had come into government with the aim of shaking things up and wanted to address unemployment by liberalising traditional labour structures. Uber fitted this model perfectly. The leaked documents reveal that company executives, including MacGann and Uber’s CEO at the time, Travis Kalanick, attended a series of meetings with Macron. Only one of these was made public before now. Uber thought the first meeting with Macron on 1 October 2014 was “spectacular. Like I’ve never seen”. The firm believed it had found a strong political champion. The leaked documents also contain dozens of personal messages and emails between Uber and its powerful new friend. Their communications were amicable, and at times casual. Emmanuel, [...] I was encouraged  by your supportive comments at LeWev [sic] [...] We continue to be committed to France and a positive transformation in the transportation sector and I’d love to have a quick chat with you, or to set up a meeting to discuss how we can continue to make progress in light of recent comments by government officials. [...] Let me know if there is a time that makes sense to connect. Looking forward to chatting soon. Travis Yes dear Travis, would be happy to chat with you. Let us schedule that ! Best, Emmanuel Uber even sent Macron proposals for how it wanted ride-sharing services regulated in France. But having such a well-connected friend was not a perfect shield. Socialist MP Thomas Thévenoud had been brought in to find common ground between taxis and ride-hailing platforms like Uber. He describes the way Uber went about its business as “cowboy”. “They put one foot in the door, then break the door wide open and once they're in, you're forced to deal with them for better or for worse.” From 1 January 2015, his new law made UberPop illegal. Uber carried on running the service as it challenged court rulings. By the summer, tensions peaked. Taxi drivers went on general strike, with protests sometimes turning violent, while government ministers called for the end of UberPop and for unlicensed drivers’ cars to be seized. Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve, who was in regular contact with the taxi unions, ordered tighter controls on UberPop drivers. “The government will never accept the law of the jungle,” he said. Macron maintained contact with Uber throughout,as the BBC has reported, and UberPop was suspended on 3 July. Uber’s powerful friend became president in 2017, and under President Macron France has thousands more drivers. A spokesperson for President Macron said that his ministerial job “led him to interact with many companies involved in the transformation of services”, which had to be facilitated by “removing administrative and regulatory barriers”. “The point is that today the French government is probably the most pro-Uber government in the western world,” Mr Thévenoud told BBC Panorama. But the years of taxi wars had also played into Uber’s narrative. In 2016, amidst more violent taxi demonstrations, the French government announced a clampdown on ride-sharing services. In response, Travis Kalanick proposed a counter-protest. When an Uber executive flagged MacGann’s concern over the safety of Uber drivers and riders, Kalanick responded: Former Uber CEO Kalanick “viewed violence as something that brought results”, says Mark MacGann. “It’s dangerous. It’s irresponsible. It’s also, in a way, very selfish. Because he was not the guy on the street who is being threatened, who is being attacked.” A spokesperson for Travis Kalanick said he “never suggested that Uber should take advantage of violence at the expense of driver safety”. That protest went ahead without incident, but this kind of exchange was not an isolated example. The leak suggests that exploiting violence against Uber drivers formed an important part of Uber’s communications strategy. In an email from the Netherlands, Uber deliberately sought to “keep the violence narrative going for a few days” as it shared police reports of attacks against its drivers with Dutch media. When those reports were published on the front page of Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf - without making Uber’s involvement clear - MacGann replied that this was “excellent work” and “exactly what we wanted”. Sharing the newspaper reports with other company executives, he added: ""Step one in the campaign: get the media to talk about Taxi violence against POP [UberPop] drivers.” Responding now to questions about his participation in Uber’s attempts to leverage violence against its drivers for strategic benefit, MacGann says: ""There is no excuse for how the company played with people’s lives. I am disgusted and ashamed that I was a party to the trivialisation of such violence.” Uber’s spokesperson Jill Hazelbaker says “there is much our former CEO said nearly a decade ago that we would certainly not condone today”. She adds nobody at the company had ever been happy about violence against drivers, and that the new management have “made safety one of the company’s top priorities”. Duping the police Fighting the law is part of the Uber spirit. The company has always seen itself as a “disruptor” – changing the world to suit its own interests. And lobbying wasn’t the only weapon in Uber’s arsenal. Back in 2014, the controversial UberPop service was also attracting the attention of the authorities in Amsterdam, where Uber had its international headquarters. When UberPop launched, the ILT,  the body responsible for transport safety in the Netherlands, said that the moment it allowed the service to be used, Uber would be breaking the law. There was initial concern among Uber’s top brass that the drivers of their ride-sharing platform would face criminal charges if arrested, according to leaked emails from a senior company executive. We've had a chat about that with TK [Travis Kalanick] while he was in Europe and agreed the real concern was jail risk. There is technically a criminal risk in a number of POP countries right now. But they did not consider it an imminent threat, and when the first arrests of UberPop drivers in Amsterdam merely resulted in formal warnings and a threat of a fine, Uber doubled down. ​​Interesting that the ILT is not taking an aggressive approach. That means we should continue to push POP full steam In December 2014, UberPop was declared illegal by a court in The Hague. But like in Paris, Uber wasn’t going to let that stop it. The documents reveal how Uber used its smartphone app to block law enforcement from getting to its drivers in the first place. Uber identified police officers through data mined from the app and then, using an internal tool called “greyball”, served them a fake view of the UberPop app, populated with ghost cars that wouldn’t stop for them. They could also block anyone from booking in certain zones, like around police stations, using a tool called “geofencing”. These tricks left law enforcement officials scratching their heads, struggling to understand why they could not book a ride. Prof Bart Custers, a digital law expert at Leiden University in the Netherlands, says that collecting and processing personal data on law enforcement officers may have been illegal. “EU data protection law prescribed there should be a legal basis for this,” he says - which the company did not appear to have. Uber says “we stopped using these tools in 2017 when Dara Khosrowshahi became CEO and, as we have said many times, they should never have been used”. The cat-and-mouse game between Dutch law enforcement and Uber continued. In March 2015 it came to a crunch when the police demanded a list of all UberPop drivers. Handing over such a document would have been hugely damaging to the firm, allowing police to arrest drivers without having to catch them in the act. Internal emails reveal that the company did not plan on co-operating and, with the battle lines drawn, Uber expected that it would not take long before its Amsterdam headquarters were raided. But Uber had a secret system to prevent the police from getting their hands on evidence: the “kill switch”. It could could lock down the company’s servers remotely, to make company information inaccessible. The Uber Files reveal how its use was more widespread than previously known and an order to use it came directly from the top. On 2 April 2015, the day of another raid on Uber’s Amsterdam offices, the company’s then CEO Travis Kalanick emailed staff to hit the kill switch. ​​Please hit the kill switch ASAP - Access must be shut down in AMS. And during a raid in Paris, executives described how the toughest part was keeping a straight face when they could not assist investigators. Conversation between Uber executives Lawyer Brendan Newitt told Panorama that if the systems were shut down once the raid began, Uber could have been breaking Dutch law. Again, Uber says such software should never have been used. It told the ICIJ that it now routinely co-operates with information requests and “does not have a ‘kill switch’ designed to thwart regulatory inquiries”. Mark MacGann said that on every occasion he was “personally involved in ‘kill switch’ activities” he was “acting on the express orders” from management in San Francisco. Kalanick’s spokesperson said he “never authorised any actions or programs that would obstruct justice in any country”, adding that Uber had “fail-safe protocols” to protect intellectual property which “do not delete any data” and were approved by Uber’s lawyers. Of course in the Netherlands too, Uber had friends in high places. Asthe BBC has reported, it had an influential secret ally in Dutch politician Neelie Kroes, whose support may have been a breach of EU ethics rules. And lobbying at the highest level would also be key to conquering another market: London. Unseating the black cabs Travis Kalanick described London as “the Champions’ League of transportation” in a 2014 interview. “It has got a more dynamic, more competitive transportation system than any other city in the world.” Not to mention one of the most recognisable fleets of taxis: black cabs. The company launched in London in summer of 2012, just in time for the Olympics. Black cabs were the only ones allowed to be hailed from the street. Minicabs and Ubers both had to be pre-booked - but Uber’s app is so quick, it’s almost like hailing a cab from the side of the road. For Uber drivers like Abdurzak Hadi, it was revolutionary. “You could drive and get a ping if someone needs to be picked up. We loved it.” The fares were lower than local minicabs and they got plenty of work. The black cabs couldn’t compete with Uber’s low fares and went to war, bringing London to a standstill with a mass demonstration in 2014. Once again, Uber began to look for friends in high places, starting with then-London Mayor, Boris Johnson. But Johnson repeatedly declined official meetings with Uber. A leaked text message reports Johnson saying that it “would be less damaging politically to be photographed with the leader of ISIS than with Travis Kalanick”. So the company went over his head. ​​The Mayor remains the central figure in London government [...] he is the ultimate target of engagement in London. Given these relationships, the need therefore is for a more positive image of Uber to be conveyed to Boris, by people that he trusts and respects. The documents show Uber’s lobbyists were welcomed into 10 Downing Street, where they met senior advisers to the prime minister at the time, David Cameron, and recorded having a “useful conversation including intelligence on Mayor's office”. They also met two government ministers that day - Sajid Javid, then minister for culture, media and sport, and Matt Hancock, then minister for business and enterprise. But neither meeting was ever declared. Hancock looked like he would be a natural ally, havingtweetedduring the taxi strike in June: “Does anyone have details of this #Uber app everyone's talking about? It sounds awesome…” Uber kept a grid of meetings, and the files show the firm’s lobbyists managed to meet with him again over dinner, adding that he used an Uber car to get home from the event, a claim Mr Hancock denies. Matt Hancock’s spokeperson said his first meeting in Downing Street was “for Number 10 officials to declare”, and the second was “a dinner about politics” that “was not declarable”. A spokesperson for Mr Hancock said: ""It was the policy of the Government - quite rightly - to attract tech companies to the UK. All the efforts Matt undertook in pursuit of that were above board and declared properly."" A spokesperson for Sajid Javid said that the “relevant departments hold no record of the meeting said to have taken place"". The lobbying went on and on. Uber targeted Tory, Lib Dem and Labour MPs. And after Number 10, it set its sights on the man next door. The documents show Kalanick was invited to a small dinner party with George Osborne, then chancellor of the exchequer, when he was visiting Silicon Valley. Uber clearly saw the evening as a work event - and privacy was a selling point. TK [Travis Kalanick], I think this is worth you doing. We were going to get you in front of Osborne when you're in London, but this is a much more private affair, no hanger-on officials or staffers. If you [...] are free the evening of the 25th, I think it would be a good use of your time. Let me know. Osborne did not declare the dinner meeting. “It perfectly encapsulates the problem with lobbying and how vested interests capture ministers and decision-making,” says lobbying expert Dr Susan Hawley, from Spotlight on Corruption. “If anything of substance is discussed, ministers should be mindful to go back and report those conversations so the civil servants can decide: how do we make sure the public interest is properly protected?” George Osborne’s spokesperson said that “far from being secret” it was the “publicly announced policy” to meet tech businesses and “persuade them to invest in Britain”. “All business meetings... were properly declared,” he said. Uber’s campaign seems to have worked though. Proposals that would have limited Uber’s expansion in London - such as a minimum five-minute wait between booking a ride and pick-up -were dropped. According to the files, Uber executives later reported that Osborne considered himself ""responsible"" for the ""positive"" outcome. These revelations are likely to prompt renewed concerns that government ministers put pressure on Boris Johnson. The documents also reveal that one minister was so impressed with Uber that they were open to further collaboration with the company. Priti Patel, then minister of state for employment, followed up a conversation with another Uber lobbyist. Her letter is contained in the leak. ​​[...] I found our conversation fascinating and I was impressed by the number of jobs you have created in the UK alone. [...]there is no doubt that we could forge an important partnership between Uber and my department. [...] I’d like to explore further how your flexible business model and our new approach to paying benefits could help get more unemployed people back into work. [...] The meeting was not declared. Patel’s spokesperson said, “For official meetings such as this, civil servants are present and responsible for making the appropriate recordings.” The drivers Travis Kalanick resigned in 2017 following a series of scandals at the company about sexual harassment, macho culture and the departure of senior executives. Uber has now been under new management for five years and says its new chief executive has transformed the company. Uber says it’s “moved from an era of confrontation to one of collaboration”. The company denies its lobbying was secret as it has always “expressed... policy positions vocally and publicly”.  It says it has “admitted many mistakes and missteps” but that “engagements with governments” are now “both in line with the law and also transparent”. Uber “will not make excuses for past behaviour” and asks “the public to judge us by what we’ve done over the last five years”. Today, Uber is still embroiled in legal battles. The company has been challenged by its drivers in several countries over whether they should be classed as workers or self-employed. Where the courts ruled that Uber should treat its drivers like employees, the company has launched appeal after appeal. In February 2021, ending a five-year legal battle, the UK’s Supreme Court ruled that Uber had to treat its drivers as workers rather than self-employed - which means they are entitled to the minimum wage, holiday pay and a pension. But in the UK, drivers have also seen cuts to the amount of cash they get for each trip. Abdurzak Hadi is now a union leader, fighting Uber for better conditions. After eight years with the company, he says he’s had enough. “I think they see me as a robot. It makes you very angry. It's not a driverless car - there's a human being driving that's actually being exploited.” In Amsterdam and elsewhere, Uber continues to challenge court rulings that drivers are employees entitled to greater workers' rights. In September last year, the company said it ""has no plans to employ drivers in the Netherlands"". The man behind the leak, Mark MacGann, says he hopes there will be a change in how Uber treats its drivers, many of whom earn “vastly less than the minimum wage”. MacGann left Uber in August 2016. He pursued legal action against the company, eventually reaching an out of court settlement. The terms were not disclosed and he provided no further details. In an interview with the Guardian, he said he resigned as he feared for his and his family's safety, citing increasing harassment from the taxi industry in various countries. He says he now regrets his role in building Uber. “I own what I did, but if it turns out that what I was trying to persuade governments, ministers, prime ministers, presidents and drivers, turned out to be horribly, horribly wrong and untrue, then it’s incumbent upon me to go back and say, ‘I think we made a mistake.’” The Uber Files is a leak of 124,000 records including emails and texts exposing conversations and meetings between Uber executives and public officials as the technology-driven taxi firm sought to expand its business. The files were leaked tothe Guardianwhich shared them with theInternational Consortium of Investigative Journalistsin Washington DC and media partners in 29 countries, including the BBC's Panorama.

"Boy who killed girl, 12, in Snapchat row gets life","Ava White died after a Christmas lights switch-on event in Liverpool A 15-year-old boy who stabbed a schoolgirl to death after a row over a Snapchat video has been sentenced for her murder. Ava White, 12, was killed in Liverpool city centre after a Christmas lights switch-on event in November 2021. The boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, claimed he accidentally stabbed her in self-defence but was found guilty after a trial. He was sentenced to life with a minimum of 13 years at Liverpool Crown Court. The trial heard Ava and her friends became involved in an argument with the teenager and three of his friends after the boys recorded Snapchat videos of her group. Ava's friends said the boy, who was 14 at the time, ""grinned"" after stabbing her in the neck with a flick-knife before fleeing the scene. She was taken to Alder Hey Children's Hospital with critical injuries and died a short time later. Ava White was described as a ""kind hearted little girl"" by her mother The boy then dumped the knife and took off his coat, which was later found in a wheelie bin, as he began covering up his actions. CCTV later showed him and his friends in a shop where the boy took a selfie and bought butter, which he said was for crumpets. He then went to a friend's home and when his mother contacted him to tell him police wanted to speak to him he told her he was playing a computer game. The boy was arrested at about 22:30 GMT, just two hours after the fatal stabbing. This video can not be played The boy is seen running away in CCTV footage released by police The court heard he denied being in the city centre at all before going on to blame another boy for the stabbing. He later said he heard one of Ava's group threaten to stab his friend if he did not delete a video of Ava and claimed he had wanted only to ""frighten her away"" and had not meant to stab her. Boy guilty of murdering girl, 12, in Snapchat row Liverpool vigil held for Ava White Hundreds attend funeral for stabbed schoolgirl Ava White The girl's mother broke down in court at the sentencing as she described her grief. Leanne White said: ""My beloved Ava dies all over again every morning I wake up. ""The moment Ava died is now yesterday, tomorrow and forever. It is the past, the present and the future. ""It is not just one horrific moment in time that happened last whenever. It is not just the moment, the hour or second. ""Our lives became permanently divided into before and after."" Ava had dreamed of travelling the world as an air hostess, her mum says She described her daughter as a ""kind hearted little girl"" and said ""precious memories are all I have left"". Her mother added: ""She will never fulfil her dream of becoming an air hostess and travelling the world."" A statement from Ava's father Robert Martin was also read to the court. He said: ""Ava was the reason I got out of bed, my reason for living. When Ava was taken away it destroyed everything I stood for and worked towards."" The court heard the boy, who has attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and attended a special school, had previously been subject to a community resolution notice after hitting a PCSO last July. Mrs Justice Yip said he had also been arrested in May last year for assault on two women and by August it was suspected he was being exploited by known criminals. Nick Johnson QC, defending, said the defendant was carrying the knife because he had previously been a victim of crime. The court heard his father had been violent towards his mother and was jailed in 2015. Balloons were released at the start a vigil in memory of Ava The boy admitted possessing the knife but denied murder and an alternative charge of manslaughter. Mrs Justice Yip said: he had shown a lack of remorse which had ""understandably caused Ava's family further distress"". Sentencing him, she said: ""There is only one reason why Ava is dead and that is because you chose to carry a knife and you chose to get it out and use it. ""You enjoyed carrying a knife. You were showing it off to your friends earlier that evening. It was a nasty weapon and you should not have had it."" Football fans paid tribute to Ava at a Merseyside derby match Det Supt Sue Coombs described the case as ""extremely shocking"" and said she hoped the sentence would be a deterrent to young people carrying knives. Ava's sister Mia White told in a statement read to the court how she wants to give talks about the impact of knife crime. The 18-year-old said: ""Hopefully if I can change at least one child's mind about using a knife I will have accomplished something special.""

Next Tory leader and PM unveiled by 5 September,"The next Conservative leader and UK prime minister will be announced on 5 September, party bosses have said. In a bid to rapidly eliminate fringe candidates, they have also decided to make it harder to enter into and progress in the contest. Tory MPs will whittle the field down to two final candidates before the end of next week, in successive rounds of voting. Around 160,000 party members will then pick the winner in a postal ballot. Eleven candidates have come forward so far in the race to replace Boris Johnson, who resigned last week after a revolt among his MPs and ministers. Who could be the next prime minister? Boris Johnson resignation: What happens now? Leadership hopefuls take potshots at Sunak on tax Other candidates could still enter the race, with Home Secretary Priti Patel believed to be weighing up whether to run. Brexit Opportunities Minister Jacob Rees-Mogg has ruled himself out,telling the Telegraph,externalhe wanted to ""unite rather than further fracture the right"". The contest so far has been dominated by the issue of taxation, with nearly all of the candidates pledging cuts to personal or business taxes, or both. Earlier, Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi, who launched his campaign over the weekend, set out plans to cut corporation tax, income tax and business rates. Fellow candidate Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has also vowed to cut taxes ""from day one"" and scrap April's hike in National Insurance. Another, former Health Secretary Sajid Javid, outlined Â£39bn in tax cuts over the weekend. The various tax-cutting proposals mark a contrast with ex-Chancellor Rishi Sunak, who will say on Tuesday that any tax cuts should have to wait until inflation has been ""gripped"". At an event to officially launch his campaign, he is expected to say: ""We need a return to traditional Conservative economic values - and that means honesty and responsibility, not fairy tales"". But he will pledge that under his leadership, reducing the tax burden is a ""question of 'when', not 'if'"". Tuesday 12 July- nominations to get on the ballot open, closing at 18.00 BST Wednesday 13 July- first round of voting among Tory MPs Thursday 14 July- likely date for second round of voting Monday 18 July- likely date for third round of voting, if required Thursday 21 July- deadline for deciding final two candidates Monday 5 September- winner announced As the leadership campaign heats up, candidate Attorney General Suella Braverman said she would pay for her own package of tax cuts by scaling back the ""size of the state and the civil service"". She also added that, if elected, she would be ""very interested in looking at the welfare bill,"" adding that there were ""far too many"" people ""choosing to work part-time and have their full-time wage topped up by welfare"". Meanwhile, Jeremy Hunt, who has already set out plans to reduce corporation tax and freeze business rates, has announced he would increase defence spending if chosen. The former foreign secretary is pledging to raise defence spending to 3% of gross domestic product. In an article for the Times on Tuesday, another candidate, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps, made the same commitment on defence spending. The other MPs standing for party leader are former equalities minister Kemi Badenoch and Foreign Officer minister Rehman Chishti. The 1922 backbench committee, which organises leadership contests, has decided candidates will now require 20 nominations from fellow Tory MPs to stand, up from eight at the last contest. Contenders will also require at least 30 votes from Tory MPs to progress past the first round of voting, up from 18 last time. Committee chairman Sir Graham Brady said they had aimed to strike a balance between letting ""serious candidates"" enter the contest, and avoiding a ""cast of thousands who don't really have a great prospect of progressing"". The party has had to strike a balance between getting on with things and giving the party a chance for a hearty debate about its future. Requiring 20 nominations to get on the ballot paper may prove tricky for some, but it's not as high a hurdle as some had thought it might be. And getting to 30 nominations to make the second round will knock out some more, although again it's not as high as the 10% of the parliamentary party, 36, suggested by some over the weekend. In short, very quickly, this broad field will narrow considerably - and then it will prove crucial where the supporters of some of the early drop outs go to next. The contender with the most declared supporters among MPs is currently Mr Sunak, followed by Trade Minister Penny Mordaunt and backbencher Tom Tugendhat. They have all amassed the 20 backers required to get on the ballot. Speaking earlier, Mr Johnsonsaid he would not be endorsingany of the candidates running to replace him. ""I wouldn't want to damage anyone's chances with my support,"" he added. Earlier, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmercriticised the candidatesfor their tax pledges, accusing them of entering an ""arms race of fantasy economics"". He also accused Tory challengers of ""hypocrisy"", as they had backed the tax hikes that have been introduced under Mr Johnson's government.

Germany fears Russia gas cut may become permanentThe crucial Nord Stream 1 pipeline is shutting down for 10 days of annual maintenance work.EuropeComments,"Nord Stream 1 facilities in Lubmin, Germany Russian natural gas supplies to Germany via the Baltic Sea pipeline Nord Stream 1 have been halted for 10 days for annual maintenance work. But German Economy Minister Robert Habeck warned that EU countries had to be prepared in case gas shipments did not resume. He has accused the Kremlin of using gas ""as a weapon"" in response to EU sanctions over the war in Ukraine. Mr Habeck admitted Germany had become too dependent on Russian gas. He described that as ""a grave political mistake as we can see today, which we are trying to remedy as quickly as we possibly can"". He said two floating terminals for deliveries of liquefied natural gas (LNG) would be ready by the end of the year. In mid-June Russia's state gas firm Gazprom cut gas flows through Nord Stream 1 to just 40% of the pipeline's capacity. It blamed a delay in the return of equipment being serviced by Germany's Siemens Energy. The Canadian government says it will now return a repaired Siemens turbine to Germany for the pipeline. That move angered the Ukrainian government, which accused Canada of adjusting the sanctions imposed on Moscow ""to the whims of Russia"". Canada says it is granting Siemens Canada a ""time-limited and revocable permit"" to send repaired turbines back to Germany, despite the sanctions. Germany's government is worried that gas supplies could be reduced or cut permanently. Pipeline maintenance is normal every summer, when gas demand is lower than in winter, but the worry is that Russia may not turn the taps back on. The pipeline shutdown is also affecting Italy, where energy group Eni said it would receive about a third less gas from Russia's Gazprom on Monday compared with average volumes supplied over the past few days. The head of the International Energy Agency, Fatih Birol, has warned that Russia may cut off gas supplies to Europe entirely and that Europe needs to prepare now. Can the world cope without Russian oil and gas? Europe told to prepare for Russia turning off gas Russia has already cut gas supplies to Poland, Bulgaria, the Netherlands, Denmark and Finland over their refusal to comply with a new payment scheme. Austria and the Czech Republic get some gas from Nord Stream 1, but Russian gas also flows to them via a Ukraine pipeline. Visiting Prague, Mr Habeck signed an agreement with the Czech Republic pledging mutual help in the event of a sharp drop in Russian gas supplies. Germany's Robert Habeck (L) spoke in Prague, where he met his Czech counterpart Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February,Germany has reduced its dependence on Russian gasfrom 55% to 35% and wants to stop using gas from Russia altogether. Last year the other main suppliers of natural gas to Germany were Norway (31%) and the Netherlands (13%). Germany is now getting more gas from them, since reducing imports from Russia. The government has also given the go-ahead for Germany's first LNG terminal to be built, at Wilhelmshaven. Another undersea Baltic pipeline from Russia, Nord Stream 2, has been built, but plans to pump gas through it are now on hold because of the war. If Russian supplies were suddenly cut overnight, this could tip Germany into a major recession, because entire industries rely on gas and most German homes use it for heating. A leading energy market analyst, Henning Gloystein of Eurasia Group, warned that ""if Nord Stream 1 doesn't come back on at all, let's say by early August, we think that the German government will have to raise its gas alert level to the third level, which is the maximum level"". ""That would be suspending the wholesale gas market and the government and regulator stepping in as the distributor of natural gas.  So that will effectively mean rationing next winter. What happens in Germany, sadly, will spread over to the rest of Europe if it gets bad, because of the geographical location in the middle of the EU,"" he told the BBC. Germany's gas storage facilities are currently about 64% full, German broadcaster ZDF reports. Industry experts quoted by German media say the chemicals sector would be hardest hit by a gas shortage. It accounts for 15% of Germany's gas consumption, and disruption could lead to shortages of goods such as fertiliser, pharmaceuticals, detergent and cosmetics. German households and key services such as hospitals will be prioritised for gas supplies under a government emergency plan.

Energy bills to rise more than predicted - Ofgem,"Domestic energy bills will rise faster this winter than previously forecast by the energy regulator Ofgem, its chief executive has admitted to MPs. Jonathan Brearley said in late May that a typical household would pay Â£800 a year more from October. But, while giving evidence to MPs, he said it was ""clear"" that estimate for winter bills now looked too low. The original figure was used by ministers when deciding how much to pay in direct assistance this winter. One industry analyst has predicted a rise of more than Â£1,200 a year in October. Cornwall Insight said that the typical domestic customer was likely to pay Â£3,244 a year from October, then Â£3,363 a year from January. The typical bill at present is about Â£2,000 a year. In itself, this was a rise of Â£700 a year in April, compared with the previous six months. About 23 million households in England, Wales and Scotland have their bills governed by the energy price cap. That limits the amount suppliers can charge per unit of energy, and the standing charge, and is set every six months. From this winter, it is expected that this will change to a three-month period. Mr Brearley said in May that a typical household gas and electricity bill on the price cap would increase to Â£2,800 a year, owing to continued volatility in gas prices. But on Monday, he told MPs on the Public Accounts Committee that it was ""clear"", given the current ""pricing dynamics"" and the ongoing war in Ukraine, that ""prices are looking higher than they did when we made that estimate"". However, he would not be drawn on exactly how much higher bills would be, ahead of the official announcement in the coming weeks. Starting later this week,direct payments will be made to low-income householdsto help with the cost of living and covering energy bills. Sarah Munby, permanent secretary at the Department for Business, said ministers would ""keep a close eye"" on whether this policy should go further if bills rose higher than expected. How high will my energy bill go? Energy bills forecast to hit Â£3,363 this winter Watchdog blamed as energy firm failures push up bills Ofgem also told MPs that it had found issues with direct debit demands from suppliers, during a review following accusations that companies increased customers' direct debit paymentsby ""more than is necessary"". More details will be announced in the coming days. Soaring wholesale prices meant around 30 suppliers have collapsed during the crisis that has hit the sector. A total of 26 remain in the market. About 2.4 million customers were automatically moved to a rival company when their own supplier folded. Typically, according to Citizens Advice, they had to pay an extra Â£30 a month for the duration of their original contract, as they were shifted to a more expensive tariff. In addition, the cost of these failures totalled Â£2.7bn - a tab which was spread across all billpayers in Britain at a cost of about Â£94 each, not just those of the failed companies. This is before taking into account the potentially multi-billion charge that households could face due to the collapse of Bulb Energy, which is in special administration. Last month, it was announced that Hayden Wood, who was the company's boss and co-founder, wouldleave at the end of July. In June, the National Audit Office (NAO) said Ofgem had allowed an energy market to develop that was vulnerable to large shocks. The NAO said that Ofgem had decided on a ""low bar"" approach for allowing new domestic energy suppliers into the market to encourage competition and choice for customers after the market had been dominated by six big companies.

Trafficked to Europe: An escape story,"Jewel, after her escape, on her wedding day Every year thousands of women are trafficked to European cities and put to work having sex with men. Jewel, a young Nigerian who had expected to become a carer, eventually managed to escape thanks to two chance meetings. ""I just saw light. It's very often dark where I come from because there's no electricityâ¦ But everything here was just blinking - it was very beautiful."" Jewel - not her real name - is describing her arrival in Denmark. ""I was thanking God for the opportunity to be in this country. I was looking forward to starting work."" Jewel caught a flight from Nigeria thinking she was going to work with old people. ""People who get trafficked go through Libya and usually take buses and boats. But this was so well organised that it wasn't suspicious at all,"" she says. The International Organisation for Migration has estimated 80% of Nigerian women travelling overland, then attempting to cross the Mediterranean, are trafficked into the European sex trade. Jewel knew of women who had suffered that fate after making the perilous journey, so when her trip began at Lagos airport, she was reassured. In Copenhagen, she was met by a Nigerian woman, who took her the following day to Vesterbro, Copenhagen's red light district. ""I was looking around for some sort of hospital,"" Jewel remembers. They walked the streets for a while, Jewel being told to take note of her surroundings. Then the woman dropped a bombshell. ""She said, 'This is where you're going to be working.' I looked round to see if she was pointing at a building I hadn't noticed. But no - she meant where we'd been walking. That's when she told me I was going to be a prostitute, and this was where I'd be hunting for customers. Then the whole of Denmark just crashed down on meâ¦"" Jewel had one fortuitous meeting that night that would later be important - Michelle Mildwater from HopeNow, an NGO supporting trafficked people in Denmark, spotted the tiny, timid, 20-something woman and gave her a card with a contact number on it. Michelle Mildwater founded HopeNow in 2007 Jewel's Nigerian boss - her ""madam"" - told her not to trust this English woman with a bike. Then she quickly found Jewel her first customer. ""The man gave her 4,000 kroner (Â£450 / $620) to take me home, and then my madam just walked away,"" says Jewel. ""He drove me for what seemed like forever. I didn't speak the language at the time and I had no idea what he was saying - we had to use Google Translate to communicate. It was scary."" In the months that followed, selling sex did not become any easier for Jewel. ""I wasn't good at it. I was that shy one in the corner. But I always got found because the regulars know when a new person arrives, and they wanted a piece of the new person."" In the most recent figures released by the EU, more than 14,000 trafficking victims were registered in 2017/2018 - but this will be the tip of the iceberg, because they represent only identified cases. Half were from outside the EU, with Nigeria one of the top five nationalities. Sexual exploitation continues to be the main purpose of trafficking, according to the European Commission, and in a single year the criminal revenues derived from it are estimated at a staggering 14bn euros (Â£12bn / $16bn). A street in Vesterbro at night The women who earn this money are told they owe their traffickers huge sums for travel and accommodation. ""They are debt-bonded,"" says Sine Plambech, a senior researcher in the Department of Migration at the Danish Institute for International Studies. ""Nigerians are one of the migrant sex worker groups with the highest debt. It could be between 10,000 and 60,000 euros. And when you have that kind of debt, you need to make a lot of money fast. And if you don't have papers that allow you to work, the fastest way to earn money is in the sex industry."" Jewel's traffickers said she would have to pay them 42,000 euros, in regular instalments. To underline their point they summoned her to a frightening meeting in a cemetery, the day before she flew out of Nigeria. ""I was forced to take an oath that I was going to pay the money no matter what, and that I was not going to reveal who trafficked me. If I did, so many bad things were going to happen to me and my family."" Once Jewel was in Denmark, the traffickers menaced her family in Nigeria. ""People just came into the house and they wanted my grandmother to talk to me about not having any ideas about reporting them to the police, or not paying the money. So every time I called her, she was always crying on the phone and reminding me that I had made this deal with these people - I had to pay or something would happen to them."" 'I was kidnapped in London and trafficked for sex' Hunting the Essex lorry killers (UK only) Shandra Woworuntu: My life as a sex-trafficking victim Jewel was under immense pressure so did not feel she could be discriminating about the clients she serviced inside and between parked cars on the streets of Vesterbro, or in their homes. ""You cannot say no. You have to say yes, because there are 10 or 15 other women looking at that same guy wanting to make some money that night,"" she says. But going with a customer to his home could be enormously risky. ""I could have died that night I was forced to remain in the bathtub,"" she remembers, still traumatised. ""The man I had to go home with asked me to get in the bathtub. And I thought, 'OK - he wants me to clean up or something.' Then he went out and came back with two buckets of ice. And he started pouring this ice on me in the bath. And I was in there naked and it's in the middle of winterâ¦"" In April this year, announcing anew strategy to combat human trafficking,external, the European Commission admitted that 10 years of efforts to tackle the problem had largely failed. ""The impunity of perpetrators in the EU persists, and the numbers of prosecutions and convictions of traffickers remain low,"" it said, making trafficking ""a low-risk and high-profit crime"". Attempts to reduce demand for the services of exploited victims had also flopped, the Commission added. The UK government says that in the year to March 2020police recorded 7,779 modern slavery crimes,external(including labour exploitation and sexual exploitation), but fewer than 250 people were charged in 2019. The UK's support services for victims of modern slavery are run by the Salvation Army. It says610 non-British survivors of sexual exploitation,externaljoined its programme in the year to June 2021. Vesterbro's main street, Istedgade, with its bars, clubs and sex shops, is noisy and brightly lit on a Saturday night. Groups of men, often unsteady on their feet from the effects of alcohol, prowl up and down. The women selling sex - most of them from Nigeria and Eastern Europe, their hair and make-up immaculate - are dressed in figure-hugging, comfy gym gear. They sport trainers you can run in - there are few pairs of high heels, and no stereotypical ""sexy"" outfits. Michelle Mildwater, who has supported foreign prostitutes in Denmark for more than a decade, still does the rounds here - giving out her card to women like Jewel, offering help and counselling. She is very aware how perilous street life is, and remembers several violent incidents in one of the district's hotels. ""We had a number of rapes in there,"" she says. ""There were times when a woman ran out with blood all over her."" At weekends, Danish NGOs run services for the women selling sex. One, Reden International, has a cafÃ© where they can rest, recuperate and get a snack between clients. And in one of the side streets, a group of volunteers host a harm reduction initiative like no other. It is called the Red Van, because that is what it is - a vehicle with a bed in the back lit by fairy lights, and a ready supply of condoms and wipes. It is a private space where sex workers can bring a client instead of going somewhere potentially unsafe. Throughout the night, a steady stream of women arrive - men in tow - to use the van's facilities, while the volunteers stand a respectful distance away but close enough to hear if a woman is in trouble. It may be used up to 28 times in a four-hour shift. Red van volunteers Pauline Hoffman Schroder, Sine Plambech and Aphinya Jatuparisakul One of the Red Van's volunteers is Sine Plambech, the academic researcher. ""These women have a problem they're trying to solve - debt, poverty, family, children. They need to work. They're going to sell sex whether we like it or not, so we provide a safe space for them while they're doing what they would do anyway,"" she says. ""Most women wouldn't sell sex if they didn't have to. You can have all these moral ideas about what's good for them, but they need to make money."" Listen to Denmark's Red Van on BBC Sounds Or browseother episodes of Assignmenton the BBC World Service Buying and selling sex in Denmark is not illegal, but you do need a work permit. The precarious migration status of many of the women selling sex in Copenhagen makes them more vulnerable - and far less likely to report any abuse or violence against them to the police. Denmark's policy is to deport irregular migrants.  Even if women are identified as victims of human trafficking, they are expected to return to their home countries after a short period in a government-sponsored safe house. After four months on the streets, desperate, depressed and tempted to take her own life, Jewel too was reluctant to report to the authorities. She still had a massive debt, and was fearful for her safety and that of her family in Nigeria. Then her life changed. It sounds corny - like a fairytale even - but Jewel met a Danish man and fell in love. On their first date, after a romantic meal, she told him everything. ""That's a burden he's had to carry,"" she says now about the man who became her husband. A painting by Jewel, expressing her feelings as a trafficked and sexually exploited woman Jewel stopped working on the streets, and he helped her make her weekly repayments to her madam. But the couple needed advice. Did Jewel know anyone who could assist them, her boyfriend asked? Jewel had kept the card Michelle Mildwater had given her that first night she sold sex in Vesterbro. Michelle counselled Jewel, helped her to confront her demons, and gave her the confidence to stop paying her madam. And fortunately, there have been no violent repercussions for her or her family - perhaps because her trafficker did not belong to one of the large transnational criminal networks. Now Jewel is awaiting the outcome of her application to remain in Denmark. Meanwhile, her Danish has become fluent and she has had a baby. Jewel and Michelle have become firm friends. And when Jewel got married, the NGO worker from HopeNow was her Best Woman. ""That's one of the proudest moments of my life - that someone walked me down the aisle, and it was Michelle who did that,"" says Jewel. Jewel hopes one day she will go to business school. She also wants to do voluntary work helping women on the streets. Just before lockdown, Michelle Mildwater, who is a former actor, encouraged Jewel to develop a play - the story of a trafficked woman - and perform it for an audience in Copenhagen. Jewel called it The Only Way Out Is Through. Jewel performing her play in Copenhagen ""That was therapy. When I was doing the show I was kind ofâ¦ out of my body. It was like I was part of the audience, and I was very touched by what I saw,"" Jewel says. ""Because this is not just a story - this is people's reality.""

ScotRail train drivers accept pay increase,"ScotRail train drivers have voted to accept a 5% pay increase, their union Aslef has announced. Trains across Scotland have been on a reduced timetable for almost two monthsduring a pay dispute. ScotRail said if drivers begin doing overtime again a full timetable could return within 10 days. Around 700 services were cut on 23 May when the dispute began and an emergency timetable was introduced. Aslef Scottish organiser Kevin Lindsay said: ""Following a ballot on the improved offer negotiated with ScotRail, Aslef members have voted to accept the proposals on pay and conditions."" David Simpson, ScotRail service delivery director, said: ""All parties involved have worked hard to find an agreement that recognises the hard work of staff and the financial challenges faced by the railway as we look to recover from the pandemic. ""ScotRail, our staff, and our customers want to have a reliable, efficient, and sustainable railway that supports the economy and connects communities across the country. This deal is a significant step towards delivering that."" Why have hundreds of trains been cancelled? Last train anger after ScotRail timetable cut TRNSMT train warning as Capaldi closes show ScotRail drivers will see their pay climb by 5% and also get more money for rest day and Sunday working, driving instructor and maternity pay along with a policy of no compulsory redundancies for the next five years. The nationalised train operator said 2.2% of the increase would be funded by Transport Scotland with the remaining 2.8% coming from ScotRail's funds. ScotRail came back into public ownership for the first time in 25 years in April, after previous operator Abellio had its franchise ended early over criticism of the quality of the service. The emergency timetable in place since May has had a major impact on evening services and caused travel disruption for a number of events. Fans at Scotland's World Cup play-off against Ukraine at Hampden Park in June had to leave early if they wanted to take the last service home. The emergency timetable had a major impact on evening and weekend trains Audiences at TRNSMT music festival in Glasgow on Sunday were told they would miss last trains home if they stayed to watch headliner Lewis Capaldi. Despite the dispute being resolved, the temporary timetable is expected to in place for up to 10 days while service levels return to normal. Visitors to The Open in St Andrews have also been urged to avoid rail travel this week. Johnnie Cole-Hamilton, director of championships at The R&A, said there was ""a risk that fans who travel by train may find there are no services to get them home"".

"Greyballing, kill switches, lobbying - Uber's dark tricks revealedUber whistleblower reveals how tech firm cosied up to world leaders and deceived investigators"," In just over a decade, Uber has revolutionised how we move around our cities. The ride-hailing app was a game-changer: you just tapped your phone and a cab would find you. You even paid through the app. The Californian tech company helped define the gig economy, where workers were seen as self-employed. Uber now has millions of drivers all over the world, and takes billions of pounds in fares. Uber often described the regulated taxi industry it was trying to break into as a “cartel”. But the company has been rocked by scandals. Uber drivers are fighting for their rights. And now a whistleblower has revealed the dark tricks Uber used to break into lucrative European markets. Mark MacGann used to be one of Uber’s top executives. He was the company’s chief lobbyist, meeting senior members of government and heads of state in over 40 countries. “People were almost falling over themselves in order to meet with Uber and to hear what we had to offer,” MacGanntold the Guardianin an exclusive interview (see video below). “It was extraordinarily easy to get access to the highest echelons of power and decision-making. It was intoxicating.” Now he’s turned whistleblower. Thousands of documents were leaked to the Guardian, who shared them with theInternational Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ)and media partners around the world, including the BBC. The Uber Files are an unprecedented insight into how one of the world’s most notorious tech companies lobbied at the highest level to assist its aggressive expansion into Europe. Uber raised billions in investment, using funds to attract drivers and passengers and challenge the rules. But Uber needed political support to disrupt the taxi industry. The leak reveals how undeclared meetings, high-level lobbying, and backroom deals helped Uber to get leading politicians to back their radical plans. The leaked documents cover the years Uber was trying to break into Europe and they show how much Uber was prepared to spend to get close to power. In 2016, its lobbying and public relations budget was $90 million (£75 million). The taxi wars Paris was the first European city where Uber launched. It’s also where co-founders Travis Kalanick and Garrett Camp first had the idea for the app, when they could not find a cab on a freezing cold night. Paris had a strong network of licensed city taxis with the monopoly on picking up roadside passengers around town. Uber’s arrival caused chaos. Uber billed itself as a tech firm that connected passengers with private-hire cars - minicabs - which had to be pre-booked. Except that its drivers could be summoned within a few minutes at the click of a button, right from the side of the road. What’s more, Uber’s prices were cut-throat - and there was no need to keep cash on hand. The Parisian cab drivers were losing customers and income – and in 2014 took their protest to the streets. Taxi drivers attacked Ubers carrying terrified passengers, smashing their windows and slashing their tyres. But Uber had a mantra, says MacGann: “It’s better to ask for forgiveness than to ask for permission”. Rather than bow to pressure, Uber pushed harder. In February 2014 it launched a controversial new service called UberPop - called a “ride-sharing” service, it was the cheapest option on the app and like offering someone a lift. UberPop drivers didn’t need to have a professional license or be insured as a taxi driver. It meant practically anyone with a car could become a cabbie, and many jumped at the chance. At a stroke, taxi drivers had lost their advantage. Uber immediately ran foul of the authorities, landing a €100,000 fine for misleadingly advertising the new service as a car pool. New legislation was being debated that would impose strict regulations on UberPop and similar ride-sharing services. But Uber had also begun to make friends with a young politician in his first ministerial post: Emmanuel Macron. In 2014, Macron was minister for the economy and digital affairs, and a rising star. He had come into government with the aim of shaking things up and wanted to address unemployment by liberalising traditional labour structures. Uber fitted this model perfectly. The leaked documents reveal that company executives, including MacGann and Uber’s CEO at the time, Travis Kalanick, attended a series of meetings with Macron. Only one of these was made public before now. Uber thought the first meeting with Macron on 1 October 2014 was “spectacular. Like I’ve never seen”. The firm believed it had found a strong political champion. The leaked documents also contain dozens of personal messages and emails between Uber and its powerful new friend. Their communications were amicable, and at times casual. Emmanuel, [...] I was encouraged  by your supportive comments at LeWev [sic] [...] We continue to be committed to France and a positive transformation in the transportation sector and I’d love to have a quick chat with you, or to set up a meeting to discuss how we can continue to make progress in light of recent comments by government officials. [...] Let me know if there is a time that makes sense to connect. Looking forward to chatting soon. Travis Yes dear Travis, would be happy to chat with you. Let us schedule that ! Best, Emmanuel Uber even sent Macron proposals for how it wanted ride-sharing services regulated in France. But having such a well-connected friend was not a perfect shield. Socialist MP Thomas Thévenoud had been brought in to find common ground between taxis and ride-hailing platforms like Uber. He describes the way Uber went about its business as “cowboy”. “They put one foot in the door, then break the door wide open and once they're in, you're forced to deal with them for better or for worse.” From 1 January 2015, his new law made UberPop illegal. Uber carried on running the service as it challenged court rulings. By the summer, tensions peaked. Taxi drivers went on general strike, with protests sometimes turning violent, while government ministers called for the end of UberPop and for unlicensed drivers’ cars to be seized. Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve, who was in regular contact with the taxi unions, ordered tighter controls on UberPop drivers. “The government will never accept the law of the jungle,” he said. Macron maintained contact with Uber throughout,as the BBC has reported, and UberPop was suspended on 3 July. Uber’s powerful friend became president in 2017, and under President Macron France has thousands more drivers. A spokesperson for President Macron said that his ministerial job “led him to interact with many companies involved in the transformation of services”, which had to be facilitated by “removing administrative and regulatory barriers”. “The point is that today the French government is probably the most pro-Uber government in the western world,” Mr Thévenoud told BBC Panorama. But the years of taxi wars had also played into Uber’s narrative. In 2016, amidst more violent taxi demonstrations, the French government announced a clampdown on ride-sharing services. In response, Travis Kalanick proposed a counter-protest. When an Uber executive flagged MacGann’s concern over the safety of Uber drivers and riders, Kalanick responded: Former Uber CEO Kalanick “viewed violence as something that brought results”, says Mark MacGann. “It’s dangerous. It’s irresponsible. It’s also, in a way, very selfish. Because he was not the guy on the street who is being threatened, who is being attacked.” A spokesperson for Travis Kalanick said he “never suggested that Uber should take advantage of violence at the expense of driver safety”. That protest went ahead without incident, but this kind of exchange was not an isolated example. The leak suggests that exploiting violence against Uber drivers formed an important part of Uber’s communications strategy. In an email from the Netherlands, Uber deliberately sought to “keep the violence narrative going for a few days” as it shared police reports of attacks against its drivers with Dutch media. When those reports were published on the front page of Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf - without making Uber’s involvement clear - MacGann replied that this was “excellent work” and “exactly what we wanted”. Sharing the newspaper reports with other company executives, he added: ""Step one in the campaign: get the media to talk about Taxi violence against POP [UberPop] drivers.” Responding now to questions about his participation in Uber’s attempts to leverage violence against its drivers for strategic benefit, MacGann says: ""There is no excuse for how the company played with people’s lives. I am disgusted and ashamed that I was a party to the trivialisation of such violence.” Uber’s spokesperson Jill Hazelbaker says “there is much our former CEO said nearly a decade ago that we would certainly not condone today”. She adds nobody at the company had ever been happy about violence against drivers, and that the new management have “made safety one of the company’s top priorities”. Duping the police Fighting the law is part of the Uber spirit. The company has always seen itself as a “disruptor” – changing the world to suit its own interests. And lobbying wasn’t the only weapon in Uber’s arsenal. Back in 2014, the controversial UberPop service was also attracting the attention of the authorities in Amsterdam, where Uber had its international headquarters. When UberPop launched, the ILT,  the body responsible for transport safety in the Netherlands, said that the moment it allowed the service to be used, Uber would be breaking the law. There was initial concern among Uber’s top brass that the drivers of their ride-sharing platform would face criminal charges if arrested, according to leaked emails from a senior company executive. We've had a chat about that with TK [Travis Kalanick] while he was in Europe and agreed the real concern was jail risk. There is technically a criminal risk in a number of POP countries right now. But they did not consider it an imminent threat, and when the first arrests of UberPop drivers in Amsterdam merely resulted in formal warnings and a threat of a fine, Uber doubled down. ​​Interesting that the ILT is not taking an aggressive approach. That means we should continue to push POP full steam In December 2014, UberPop was declared illegal by a court in The Hague. But like in Paris, Uber wasn’t going to let that stop it. The documents reveal how Uber used its smartphone app to block law enforcement from getting to its drivers in the first place. Uber identified police officers through data mined from the app and then, using an internal tool called “greyball”, served them a fake view of the UberPop app, populated with ghost cars that wouldn’t stop for them. They could also block anyone from booking in certain zones, like around police stations, using a tool called “geofencing”. These tricks left law enforcement officials scratching their heads, struggling to understand why they could not book a ride. Prof Bart Custers, a digital law expert at Leiden University in the Netherlands, says that collecting and processing personal data on law enforcement officers may have been illegal. “EU data protection law prescribed there should be a legal basis for this,” he says - which the company did not appear to have. Uber says “we stopped using these tools in 2017 when Dara Khosrowshahi became CEO and, as we have said many times, they should never have been used”. The cat-and-mouse game between Dutch law enforcement and Uber continued. In March 2015 it came to a crunch when the police demanded a list of all UberPop drivers. Handing over such a document would have been hugely damaging to the firm, allowing police to arrest drivers without having to catch them in the act. Internal emails reveal that the company did not plan on co-operating and, with the battle lines drawn, Uber expected that it would not take long before its Amsterdam headquarters were raided. But Uber had a secret system to prevent the police from getting their hands on evidence: the “kill switch”. It could could lock down the company’s servers remotely, to make company information inaccessible. The Uber Files reveal how its use was more widespread than previously known and an order to use it came directly from the top. On 2 April 2015, the day of another raid on Uber’s Amsterdam offices, the company’s then CEO Travis Kalanick emailed staff to hit the kill switch. ​​Please hit the kill switch ASAP - Access must be shut down in AMS. And during a raid in Paris, executives described how the toughest part was keeping a straight face when they could not assist investigators. Conversation between Uber executives Lawyer Brendan Newitt told Panorama that if the systems were shut down once the raid began, Uber could have been breaking Dutch law. Again, Uber says such software should never have been used. It told the ICIJ that it now routinely co-operates with information requests and “does not have a ‘kill switch’ designed to thwart regulatory inquiries”. Mark MacGann said that on every occasion he was “personally involved in ‘kill switch’ activities” he was “acting on the express orders” from management in San Francisco. Kalanick’s spokesperson said he “never authorised any actions or programs that would obstruct justice in any country”, adding that Uber had “fail-safe protocols” to protect intellectual property which “do not delete any data” and were approved by Uber’s lawyers. Of course in the Netherlands too, Uber had friends in high places. Asthe BBC has reported, it had an influential secret ally in Dutch politician Neelie Kroes, whose support may have been a breach of EU ethics rules. And lobbying at the highest level would also be key to conquering another market: London. Unseating the black cabs Travis Kalanick described London as “the Champions’ League of transportation” in a 2014 interview. “It has got a more dynamic, more competitive transportation system than any other city in the world.” Not to mention one of the most recognisable fleets of taxis: black cabs. The company launched in London in summer of 2012, just in time for the Olympics. Black cabs were the only ones allowed to be hailed from the street. Minicabs and Ubers both had to be pre-booked - but Uber’s app is so quick, it’s almost like hailing a cab from the side of the road. For Uber drivers like Abdurzak Hadi, it was revolutionary. “You could drive and get a ping if someone needs to be picked up. We loved it.” The fares were lower than local minicabs and they got plenty of work. The black cabs couldn’t compete with Uber’s low fares and went to war, bringing London to a standstill with a mass demonstration in 2014. Once again, Uber began to look for friends in high places, starting with then-London Mayor, Boris Johnson. But Johnson repeatedly declined official meetings with Uber. A leaked text message reports Johnson saying that it “would be less damaging politically to be photographed with the leader of ISIS than with Travis Kalanick”. So the company went over his head. ​​The Mayor remains the central figure in London government [...] he is the ultimate target of engagement in London. Given these relationships, the need therefore is for a more positive image of Uber to be conveyed to Boris, by people that he trusts and respects. The documents show Uber’s lobbyists were welcomed into 10 Downing Street, where they met senior advisers to the prime minister at the time, David Cameron, and recorded having a “useful conversation including intelligence on Mayor's office”. They also met two government ministers that day - Sajid Javid, then minister for culture, media and sport, and Matt Hancock, then minister for business and enterprise. But neither meeting was ever declared. Hancock looked like he would be a natural ally, havingtweetedduring the taxi strike in June: “Does anyone have details of this #Uber app everyone's talking about? It sounds awesome…” Uber kept a grid of meetings, and the files show the firm’s lobbyists managed to meet with him again over dinner, adding that he used an Uber car to get home from the event, a claim Mr Hancock denies. Matt Hancock’s spokeperson said his first meeting in Downing Street was “for Number 10 officials to declare”, and the second was “a dinner about politics” that “was not declarable”. A spokesperson for Mr Hancock said: ""It was the policy of the Government - quite rightly - to attract tech companies to the UK. All the efforts Matt undertook in pursuit of that were above board and declared properly."" A spokesperson for Sajid Javid said that the “relevant departments hold no record of the meeting said to have taken place"". The lobbying went on and on. Uber targeted Tory, Lib Dem and Labour MPs. And after Number 10, it set its sights on the man next door. The documents show Kalanick was invited to a small dinner party with George Osborne, then chancellor of the exchequer, when he was visiting Silicon Valley. Uber clearly saw the evening as a work event - and privacy was a selling point. TK [Travis Kalanick], I think this is worth you doing. We were going to get you in front of Osborne when you're in London, but this is a much more private affair, no hanger-on officials or staffers. If you [...] are free the evening of the 25th, I think it would be a good use of your time. Let me know. Osborne did not declare the dinner meeting. “It perfectly encapsulates the problem with lobbying and how vested interests capture ministers and decision-making,” says lobbying expert Dr Susan Hawley, from Spotlight on Corruption. “If anything of substance is discussed, ministers should be mindful to go back and report those conversations so the civil servants can decide: how do we make sure the public interest is properly protected?” George Osborne’s spokesperson said that “far from being secret” it was the “publicly announced policy” to meet tech businesses and “persuade them to invest in Britain”. “All business meetings... were properly declared,” he said. Uber’s campaign seems to have worked though. Proposals that would have limited Uber’s expansion in London - such as a minimum five-minute wait between booking a ride and pick-up -were dropped. According to the files, Uber executives later reported that Osborne considered himself ""responsible"" for the ""positive"" outcome. These revelations are likely to prompt renewed concerns that government ministers put pressure on Boris Johnson. The documents also reveal that one minister was so impressed with Uber that they were open to further collaboration with the company. Priti Patel, then minister of state for employment, followed up a conversation with another Uber lobbyist. Her letter is contained in the leak. ​​[...] I found our conversation fascinating and I was impressed by the number of jobs you have created in the UK alone. [...]there is no doubt that we could forge an important partnership between Uber and my department. [...] I’d like to explore further how your flexible business model and our new approach to paying benefits could help get more unemployed people back into work. [...] The meeting was not declared. Patel’s spokesperson said, “For official meetings such as this, civil servants are present and responsible for making the appropriate recordings.” The drivers Travis Kalanick resigned in 2017 following a series of scandals at the company about sexual harassment, macho culture and the departure of senior executives. Uber has now been under new management for five years and says its new chief executive has transformed the company. Uber says it’s “moved from an era of confrontation to one of collaboration”. The company denies its lobbying was secret as it has always “expressed... policy positions vocally and publicly”.  It says it has “admitted many mistakes and missteps” but that “engagements with governments” are now “both in line with the law and also transparent”. Uber “will not make excuses for past behaviour” and asks “the public to judge us by what we’ve done over the last five years”. Today, Uber is still embroiled in legal battles. The company has been challenged by its drivers in several countries over whether they should be classed as workers or self-employed. Where the courts ruled that Uber should treat its drivers like employees, the company has launched appeal after appeal. In February 2021, ending a five-year legal battle, the UK’s Supreme Court ruled that Uber had to treat its drivers as workers rather than self-employed - which means they are entitled to the minimum wage, holiday pay and a pension. But in the UK, drivers have also seen cuts to the amount of cash they get for each trip. Abdurzak Hadi is now a union leader, fighting Uber for better conditions. After eight years with the company, he says he’s had enough. “I think they see me as a robot. It makes you very angry. It's not a driverless car - there's a human being driving that's actually being exploited.” In Amsterdam and elsewhere, Uber continues to challenge court rulings that drivers are employees entitled to greater workers' rights. In September last year, the company said it ""has no plans to employ drivers in the Netherlands"". The man behind the leak, Mark MacGann, says he hopes there will be a change in how Uber treats its drivers, many of whom earn “vastly less than the minimum wage”. MacGann left Uber in August 2016. He pursued legal action against the company, eventually reaching an out of court settlement. The terms were not disclosed and he provided no further details. In an interview with the Guardian, he said he resigned as he feared for his and his family's safety, citing increasing harassment from the taxi industry in various countries. He says he now regrets his role in building Uber. “I own what I did, but if it turns out that what I was trying to persuade governments, ministers, prime ministers, presidents and drivers, turned out to be horribly, horribly wrong and untrue, then it’s incumbent upon me to go back and say, ‘I think we made a mistake.’” The Uber Files is a leak of 124,000 records including emails and texts exposing conversations and meetings between Uber executives and public officials as the technology-driven taxi firm sought to expand its business. The files were leaked tothe Guardianwhich shared them with theInternational Consortium of Investigative Journalistsin Washington DC and media partners in 29 countries, including the BBC's Panorama.

Germany fears Russia gas cut may become permanent,"Nord Stream 1 facilities in Lubmin, Germany Russian natural gas supplies to Germany via the Baltic Sea pipeline Nord Stream 1 have been halted for 10 days for annual maintenance work. But German Economy Minister Robert Habeck warned that EU countries had to be prepared in case gas shipments did not resume. He has accused the Kremlin of using gas ""as a weapon"" in response to EU sanctions over the war in Ukraine. Mr Habeck admitted Germany had become too dependent on Russian gas. He described that as ""a grave political mistake as we can see today, which we are trying to remedy as quickly as we possibly can"". He said two floating terminals for deliveries of liquefied natural gas (LNG) would be ready by the end of the year. In mid-June Russia's state gas firm Gazprom cut gas flows through Nord Stream 1 to just 40% of the pipeline's capacity. It blamed a delay in the return of equipment being serviced by Germany's Siemens Energy. The Canadian government says it will now return a repaired Siemens turbine to Germany for the pipeline. That move angered the Ukrainian government, which accused Canada of adjusting the sanctions imposed on Moscow ""to the whims of Russia"". Canada says it is granting Siemens Canada a ""time-limited and revocable permit"" to send repaired turbines back to Germany, despite the sanctions. Germany's government is worried that gas supplies could be reduced or cut permanently. Pipeline maintenance is normal every summer, when gas demand is lower than in winter, but the worry is that Russia may not turn the taps back on. The pipeline shutdown is also affecting Italy, where energy group Eni said it would receive about a third less gas from Russia's Gazprom on Monday compared with average volumes supplied over the past few days. The head of the International Energy Agency, Fatih Birol, has warned that Russia may cut off gas supplies to Europe entirely and that Europe needs to prepare now. Can the world cope without Russian oil and gas? Europe told to prepare for Russia turning off gas Russia has already cut gas supplies to Poland, Bulgaria, the Netherlands, Denmark and Finland over their refusal to comply with a new payment scheme. Austria and the Czech Republic get some gas from Nord Stream 1, but Russian gas also flows to them via a Ukraine pipeline. Visiting Prague, Mr Habeck signed an agreement with the Czech Republic pledging mutual help in the event of a sharp drop in Russian gas supplies. Germany's Robert Habeck (L) spoke in Prague, where he met his Czech counterpart Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February,Germany has reduced its dependence on Russian gasfrom 55% to 35% and wants to stop using gas from Russia altogether. Last year the other main suppliers of natural gas to Germany were Norway (31%) and the Netherlands (13%). Germany is now getting more gas from them, since reducing imports from Russia. The government has also given the go-ahead for Germany's first LNG terminal to be built, at Wilhelmshaven. Another undersea Baltic pipeline from Russia, Nord Stream 2, has been built, but plans to pump gas through it are now on hold because of the war. If Russian supplies were suddenly cut overnight, this could tip Germany into a major recession, because entire industries rely on gas and most German homes use it for heating. A leading energy market analyst, Henning Gloystein of Eurasia Group, warned that ""if Nord Stream 1 doesn't come back on at all, let's say by early August, we think that the German government will have to raise its gas alert level to the third level, which is the maximum level"". ""That would be suspending the wholesale gas market and the government and regulator stepping in as the distributor of natural gas.  So that will effectively mean rationing next winter. What happens in Germany, sadly, will spread over to the rest of Europe if it gets bad, because of the geographical location in the middle of the EU,"" he told the BBC. Germany's gas storage facilities are currently about 64% full, German broadcaster ZDF reports. Industry experts quoted by German media say the chemicals sector would be hardest hit by a gas shortage. It accounts for 15% of Germany's gas consumption, and disruption could lead to shortages of goods such as fertiliser, pharmaceuticals, detergent and cosmetics. German households and key services such as hospitals will be prioritised for gas supplies under a government emergency plan.

Energy bills to rise more than predicted - OfgemThe regulator's chief executive tells MPs its previous estimate on winter bills will prove to be too low.,"Domestic energy bills will rise faster this winter than previously forecast by the energy regulator Ofgem, its chief executive has admitted to MPs. Jonathan Brearley said in late May that a typical household would pay Â£800 a year more from October. But, while giving evidence to MPs, he said it was ""clear"" that estimate for winter bills now looked too low. The original figure was used by ministers when deciding how much to pay in direct assistance this winter. One industry analyst has predicted a rise of more than Â£1,200 a year in October. Cornwall Insight said that the typical domestic customer was likely to pay Â£3,244 a year from October, then Â£3,363 a year from January. The typical bill at present is about Â£2,000 a year. In itself, this was a rise of Â£700 a year in April, compared with the previous six months. About 23 million households in England, Wales and Scotland have their bills governed by the energy price cap. That limits the amount suppliers can charge per unit of energy, and the standing charge, and is set every six months. From this winter, it is expected that this will change to a three-month period. Mr Brearley said in May that a typical household gas and electricity bill on the price cap would increase to Â£2,800 a year, owing to continued volatility in gas prices. But on Monday, he told MPs on the Public Accounts Committee that it was ""clear"", given the current ""pricing dynamics"" and the ongoing war in Ukraine, that ""prices are looking higher than they did when we made that estimate"". However, he would not be drawn on exactly how much higher bills would be, ahead of the official announcement in the coming weeks. Starting later this week,direct payments will be made to low-income householdsto help with the cost of living and covering energy bills. Sarah Munby, permanent secretary at the Department for Business, said ministers would ""keep a close eye"" on whether this policy should go further if bills rose higher than expected. How high will my energy bill go? Energy bills forecast to hit Â£3,363 this winter Watchdog blamed as energy firm failures push up bills Ofgem also told MPs that it had found issues with direct debit demands from suppliers, during a review following accusations that companies increased customers' direct debit paymentsby ""more than is necessary"". More details will be announced in the coming days. Soaring wholesale prices meant around 30 suppliers have collapsed during the crisis that has hit the sector. A total of 26 remain in the market. About 2.4 million customers were automatically moved to a rival company when their own supplier folded. Typically, according to Citizens Advice, they had to pay an extra Â£30 a month for the duration of their original contract, as they were shifted to a more expensive tariff. In addition, the cost of these failures totalled Â£2.7bn - a tab which was spread across all billpayers in Britain at a cost of about Â£94 each, not just those of the failed companies. This is before taking into account the potentially multi-billion charge that households could face due to the collapse of Bulb Energy, which is in special administration. Last month, it was announced that Hayden Wood, who was the company's boss and co-founder, wouldleave at the end of July. In June, the National Audit Office (NAO) said Ofgem had allowed an energy market to develop that was vulnerable to large shocks. The NAO said that Ofgem had decided on a ""low bar"" approach for allowing new domestic energy suppliers into the market to encourage competition and choice for customers after the market had been dominated by six big companies.

Extinction Rebellion end coal mine occupation,"Extinction Rebellion supplied these pictures of them occupying the site of Aberpergwm mine More than 60 Extinction Rebellion activists have ended an occupation at a coal mine that is due for expansion. The protesters arrived at Aberpergwm mine, near Glynneath, Neath Port Talbot on Sunday afternoon. Seven people have been arrested on suspicion of aggravated trespass, South Wales Police confirmed. Demonstrators object to the ""silence"" of the Welsh government afterapproval was given for another 40 million tonnes of coalto be dug at the site. The Welsh government previously stated it did not have the powers to make a decision on these expansion plans, which nowfaces a judicial review. Extinction Rebellion members, some dressed in white hazmat suits and carrying black flags bearing the group's logo, began setting off flares and climbing onto roofs after entering the site about 16:30 (BST) on Sunday. What is Extinction Rebellion and what does it want? 'I'm really scared about what the future will hold' Welsh ministers 'could have stopped mine go-ahead' They claim the licence contravened the Senedd's own climate change targets as well as the Wellbeing of Future Generations Act 2015, which requires public bodies in Wales to consider the long-term impact of their decisions. The last remaining protesters had left by 11.15 BST on Monday. Some protesters have left voluntarily while five have been arrested Accountant and protestor Mel Price, 55, from Swansea added: ""We are destroying our climate and our wonderful biodiversity. ""The technology is here to allow us to transition away from fossil fuels but we need to do it now."" Speaking toRadio Wales Breakfast, activist Grug said: ""The Welsh government has remained silent on this issue - there is a judicial review which Coal Action Network have taken forward. ""It's really important to highlight this to the public. ""If this expansion goes ahead there will be 100 million tones of C02 released into the air, so it's really important that we keep the pressure on. ""The Welsh government signed up to theGlasgow Climate Pact,external, that came from COP26 and specifically mentions coal, as well as theBeyond Oil and Gas Alliance,external. ""If they can't do anything about [this expansion] then they should at least be asking that the decision is overturned and stating they don't want this to go ahead because they are committed to investing in renewables and a transition to green energies."" Aberpergwm provides coal to Tata Steel in Port Talbot The Welsh government said it cannot comment further due to the legal proceedings. However a spokesperson added: ""We have been clear that we did not have the powers to make a decision in this case as it pre-dates our powers on coal licensing. ""The fundamental issue is having a Coal Authority whose duty is to maintain a coal mining industry in the UK and we have been calling for the UK Government to change this duty in the Coal Industry Act to address the climate emergency."" The UK government, which oversees the Coal Authority that is responsible for licensing coal mines, said it has reduced the country's reliance on coal. A spokesperson added: ""UK government ministers have no formal role in the licensing process. ""The UK government's view is that the Coal Industry Act 1994 states, where a coal operator wants to mine in Wales, it must seek the approval of the Welsh ministers as part of its application for a licence to do so."" The Coal Action Network has secured a judicial review into the planned expansion of Aberpergwm colliery The colliery is the only producer of high-grade anthracite in western Europe and supplies the nearby Tata Steel plant in Port Talbot. However, the mine's operator Energybuild has said most of the coal will be used for processes such as water filtration and to make batteries for electric vehicles, rather than being burned. Green MP Carline Lucasbranded the original expansion decisionas ""shameful"", while the legal challenge has been backed by the Welsh Liberal Democrats, who accused the Welsh government of dithering.

"I'm not backing any Tory contender, says Johnson","This video can not be played WATCH: 'I wouldn't want to damage anyone's chances with my support', says Johnson Boris Johnson has refused to endorse any of the candidates running to replace him as Tory leader and PM. Speaking for the first time since he announced last week that he was quitting, he said his successor should continue his own ""great agenda"". Eleven candidates have come forward so far, most of them currently ministers in Mr Johnson's government. Backbench Tory MPs are expected to set out the party's rules for the contest later on Monday. Votes by Conservative MPs will narrow the field to two candidates by the time Parliament starts its summer break at the end of next week, with around 160,000 party members then having the final say over the next few months. The candidates who have declared so far are: Former equalities minister Kemi Badenoch Attorney General Suella Braverman Foreign Office minister Rehman Chishti Former Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt Former Health Secretary Sajid Javid Trade minister Penny Mordaunt Transport Secretary Grant Shapps Former Chancellor Rishi Sunak Foreign Secretary Liz Truss Backbencher MP Tom Tugendhat Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi Home Secretary Priti Patel is also believed to be weighing up whether to run. The contender with the most declared supporters among MPs is currently Rishi Sunak, followed by Ms Mordaunt and then Mr Tugendhat. Speaking at the Francis Crick Institute, a biomedical research facility in central London, Mr Johnson promised to spend his final weeks in Downing Street delivering ""the programme we were elected on"" in the Conservatives' landslide general victory of 2019. He added that it was ""not the job of the prime minister at this stage"" to comment on a preferred successor. Who could be the next prime minister? Truss enters Tory race to replace Johnson ""The job of the prime minister at this stage is to let the party decide, let them get on with it and to continue delivering on the projects that we were elected to deliver,"" Mr Johnson said. ""I know that whatever happens and whoever takes over, there is a great, great agenda to be continued."" Most of the candidates have focused on the issue of tax cuts during the early skirmishes of the contest. Ms Truss, who announced on Monday that she was running, said she planned to slash corporation tax, reverse the recent National Insurance hike and reform business rates. If elected she would take ""immediate action"" to assist with living costs, shewrote in the Daily Telegraph.,external We don't yet know the rules of this race, or where the finish line is, but that's not holding anyone back. So far, in short, we see the former chancellor Rishi Sunak leaping to the front when it comes to endorsements from fellow MPs. And we see every other candidate, in one way or another, taking a potshot at him, particularly on the issue of tax. The reason is this: by any modern comparison, tax and government spending is through the roof. Plenty of Conservatives find this, well, un-Conservative. And who's been chancellor for the last few years? Ah yes, Mr Sunak. Read more from Chris here. At the official launch of his campaign, Mr Javid said the Conservative Party had ""lost its way"", and promised to ""make tough decisions in the national interest"". He promised to improve the UK's productivity, using tax cuts to ""kick-start growth"", while focusing on increasing social mobility and building more homes. ""We are not owed a prosperous future and we cannot just hope for it to arrive,"" Mr Javid added. Interviewed on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Tugendhat said he would be ""looking to lower taxes across every aspect of society"", adding that he had been ""one of a few Conservative MPs who didn't vote for the National Insurance rise"", which he called a ""tax on jobs"". Meanwhile, Mr Hunt told BBC Breakfast he would ""get the British economy going"", having served ""at the coalface"" by setting up his own business. But he added that it would not be ""moral"" to do this by borrowing so much that the government was ""loading up debts on future generations"". Chancellor Mr Zahawi pledged to cut the base rate of income tax if elected prime minister. Speaking at a Conservative Way Forward event, he said he would reduce it to 19p next year and 18p the following year. However, Mr Sunak, who resigned as chancellor last week in protest at Mr Johnson's approach in office, has played down the prospect of tax cuts before public finances improve. He warned against ""comforting fairy tales"" that would ""leave our children worse-off tomorrow"". Nusrat Ghani played down the chances of a stop-gap replacement for Boris Johnson The 1922 Committee of backbench Conservative MPs meets later on Monday to set out the timetable for the leadership contest. This comes amid calls from opposition parties and some Tory MPs for Mr Johnson to go immediately and appoint a caretaker prime minister in the meantime, with some suggesting his deputy Dominic Raab, who is not running for leader. Committee vice-chair Nusrat Ghani told BBC Radio 4's World at One: ""I do get contacted by colleagues from all sides of the party and there has been disquiet that we haven't had a situation where there was a caretaker prime minister in place. ""But I really do think that ship has sailed and I firmly think that, as the 1922, we just need to now focus on running a really smooth and efficient leadership election."" Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer criticised some of the Tory contenders over what he called ""unfunded spending commitments"" and an ""arms race of fantasy economics"". He also attacked them for now opposing tax rises introduced by Mr Johnson and Mr Sunak, after voting for them previously.

Leadership hopefuls take potshots at Sunak on tax,"One thing Westminster is rarely short of is ambition. And what greater thing to aspire to than leading your country. A minibus full of wannabes, with a cargo ship of promises not far behind. Talk of futures and pasts, slick and not so slick videos, websites, Twitter handles and newspaper articles abound. We don't yet know the rules of this race, or where the finish line is, but that's not holding anyone back. So far, in short, we see the former chancellor Rishi Sunak leaping to the front when it comes to endorsements from fellow MPs. And we see every other candidate, in one way or another, taking a potshot at him, particularly on the issue of tax. The reason is this: by any modern comparison, tax and government spending is through the roof. Tories using fantasy economics, Labour leader says Tory leadership rivals battle over tax cut pledges Plenty of Conservatives find this, well, un-Conservative. And who's been chancellor for the last few years? Ah yes, Mr Sunak. It's a useful reminder too as we hear the avalanche of aspirations that will tumble towards us in the coming hours and days. Remember who these candidates are talking to: firstly Conservative MPs, and then members of the Conservative Party around the country. Those party members - 100,000 or so people - have the awesome responsibility of picking our next prime minister on behalf of the rest of us. Of course, the winner has to make the case to party members that they can win a general election, but they need to convince those party members that they share their outlook on what it is to be a Conservative too. It is also worth remembering, and moments like this emphasise this point, our big political parties are broad churches. Under the banner of Conservative, or indeed Labour, sits a broad range of views. Some of these emerge in public some of the time. But most are articulated privately, most of time, until moments like this, when they burst out for all to see. The opportunity for the Conservatives is to renew while in office, picking their fourth prime minister since they came into government in 2010. Who could be the next prime minister? Tax cut beauty contest could turn ugly The danger for them is tearing themselves apart in public. For the next day or two, expect plenty of noise. Those likely to be eliminated early on will make the loudest pitches now, while they can. Those more hopeful of making it through the first few rounds of voting at Westminster at least will ration their early appearances, trying to ensure their policy platform can withstand the inevitable scrutiny that will soon come their way. By a week on Thursday we expect MPs to have whittled the wannabes down to a final two. Ordinary party members are likely to then have from late July until roughly the end of August to take their pick, selecting the man or woman who will replace Boris Johnson at the beginning of September. 5 things that led to downfall What happens now?

Cambridge University reviewing student deaths,"Cambridge University is looking at the deaths alongside public health bodies Cambridge University is holding a review after five students died in recent months. One of the deaths, which all happened between March and June, has been confirmed as a suicide, while four others are suspected suicides. Senior pro vice-chancellor Prof Graham Virgo said it had ""distressed the whole of the university community"". Learning from an initial review after the first four deaths was being used as part of ongoing plans, he added. A second-year history student died in March 2022, three other students died in May and another died in June. The history student's inquest heard he was ""on course to finish as one of the most accomplished students in his year"". Cambridgeshire and Peterborough assistant coroner Simon Milburn said there was ""absolutely no indication that he was struggling"". The inquest heard he had no contact with college counselling services and his GP confirmed there was no history of mental health issues. If you are feeling emotionally distressed, help and support is available viaBBC Action Line The head of charity Survivors of Suicide, Claire Curran, who has been supporting his family, said: ""Like any family who are bereaved by suicide they are devastated, they are distraught, very traumatised, really struggling to get their heads around what's happened; immense sadness. ""This is not the kind of death that anyone ever wants to experience."" She added it was ""really important"" to let people know there were support services available and to make sure they were accessible when needed. Cambridge University has collated the number of student suicides since 2017-18, according to a Freedom of Information response. Over the four years prior to 2021-22, four students were confirmed to have died by suicide, with one suspected. Prof Graham Virgo said the five deaths had ""distressed the whole of the university community"" Following the fourth death this year, the university approached the NHS and public health agencies to set up an investigation group to ""review what has happened and what the lessons [are] that we can learn,"" Prof Virgo said. ""One thing that came out of the review was that there was no common cause behind these student deaths, but we have, reflecting on the discussions arising from the review, considered various aspects of our practice,"" he said. ""We already have, for example, training relating to suicide prevention and we want to ensure that training is as good as it can possibly be."" The fifth death occurred after the start of that review and is currently under review itself. These reviews are separate from coroner's inquests. Prof Virgo said: ""We consider all the student deaths that have occurred at the University of Cambridge to be tragic and very concerning. We are not in a position to speculate as to what happened in these cases. ""But we are engaging very carefully with the whole student population with professionals within the university and outside to get a better understanding of what might be going on. I am not in a position to say it is one particular cause. ""It is undoubtedly complex, but it is something that we are seeing throughout the country and certainly throughout the university sector."" More students are accessing Cambridge University's mental health services In 2021, 2,123 students accessed the university's central mental health service while 453 used college-based services, compared to 1,655 and 136 respectively in 2017. Ben Dalitz, the student union's welfare and community officer, said that universities had been tasked with creating a suicide prevention policy by the government, but an initial draft of Cambridge's had been ""altered quite a lot"". ""University senior leadership buckled under pressure from the heads of colleges to water down the policy and we've been really quite concerned to see what started as a conversation about student safety turning into one that's really about legal liability,"" they said. Prof Virgo said the university already spends Â£4.5m a year on mental health and wellbeing, and will be allocating an additional Â£5m over the next five years. ""Working together, the University and Colleges have been developing and implementing an action plan, much of which was in development before these tragic deaths, which further enhances the support available for students,"" he said. He said their plans included an ""increase in investment into the university counselling service and dedicated wellbeing advisors in colleges to enable early identification of students in distress"". A spokeswoman from Cambridgeshire and Peterborough Integrated Care System (ICS), which was involved in the review, said: ""We want to express our deepest condolences to the families and our thoughts are with them and friends of those who have been affected. ""We're committed to working together to ensure that we support our most vulnerable people with managing their mental health."" Prof Virgo said the university already spends Â£4.5m a year on mental health and wellbeing and plans to increase that According to the most recent data from the Office of National Statistics (ONS), published in May, the suicide rate for higher education students in the academic year ending 2020 in England and Wales was three deaths per 100,000 students, the lowest rate in four years. Between 2016-17 and 2019-20, students also had a significantly lower suicide rate compared with the general population of similar ages. Prof Steve West, the president of Universities UK, which represents 140 universities, said the sector shares a ""resolute commitment"" to prevent student suicides. ""Across the UK, we are seeing an increase in the number of young adults experiencing mental ill health and this is reflected in student populations, with increasing demand for support and treatment both in universities and the NHS. ""Whilst there is no evidence that overall numbers of student deaths by suicide are increasing, risk factors such as self-harm, depression, debt, disengagement and loneliness mean that universities need to be vigilant to spot the signs and respond quickly."" Ms Curran added the history student's family would say that ""no matter how bad things are, ending your own life is not the answer. ""No family want to go through this pain. No family want to feel this devastation. Please, please, please talk to someone and get some help, because people really do care.""

Truss enters Tory leadership race,"Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has joined the race to replace Boris Johnson. Declaring her plans inthe Daily Telegraph,external, Ms Truss pledged to start cutting taxes ""from day one"". Many of the 11 leadership hopefuls looking to become the Tory party leader have set out competing tax plans as a core element of their proposals. Mr Johnson said he would not be endorsing anyone as his successor, as he preferred leaving the candidates to ""get on with it"". The 1922 Committee of backbench Tory MPs which organises Conservative leadership contests will meet on Monday to decide the timetable and rules of the race. The two-stage process will see Tory MPs whittle down the candidates to two, through voting rounds, before party members decide the winner to become new Conservative party leader and prime minister. Analysis: Tax cut competition could turn ugly Tories using fantasy economics, Labour leader says Who could be the next prime minister? Political landscape being re-shaped before our eyes Ms Truss indicated that she would echo her rivals in planning to slash corporation tax, reverse the National Insurance hike and reform business rates. She wrote that it ""isn't right to be putting up taxes now"" and if elected she would take ""immediate action"" to assist with living costs. The foreign secretary said she would ""fight the election as a Conservative and govern as a Conservative"". The candidates for Tory leader, and prime minister, who have declared so far are: former equalities minister Kemi Badenoch Attorney General Suella Braverman newly-appointed Foreign Office minister Rehman Chishti former Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt former Health Secretary Sajid Javid Trade minister Penny Mordaunt Transport Secretary Grant Shapps former Chancellor Rishi Sunak Foreign Secretary Liz Truss backbencher Tom Tugendhat Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi Home Secretary Priti Patel is also believed to be weighing up whether to run. Speaking for the first time since he announced his resignation last week, Mr Johnson said: ""The job of the prime minister at this stage is to let the party decide [its new leader], let them get on with it and to continue delivering on the projects that we were elected to deliver."" ""Whatever happens and whoever takes over, there is a great, great agenda to be continued,"" he added. Taxation has emerged as a key policy area for many of the candidates, but questions have been raised about how cuts will be paid for, and whether spending plans will be slashed. Interviewed on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Tugendhat said he would be ""looking to lower taxes across every aspect of society"", adding that he had been ""one of a few Conservative MPs who didn't vote for the National Insurance rise"", which he called a ""tax on jobs"". He said the UK needed to be ""going for growth"" - which he insisted could only be achieved by taking ""the brakes off the economy"" and boosting the private sector. Mr Tugendhat also pledged to ""deliver the benefits"" of Brexit, saying he would open up trade agreements and change ""the way we invest around the country"". Meanwhile, Mr Hunt told BBC Breakfast he would ""get the British economy going"", having served ""at the coalface"" by setting up his own business. ""We need to have a lower-tax environment to help businesses get off the ground,"" he added, which would include cutting corporation tax. Mr Hunt said it was possible to do this ""within our fiscal rules if we spread them over a five-year period, which means that our national debt continues to fall as a proportion of our output"". ""And I think that's not just right; it's moral,"" he said. ""We shouldn't be cutting taxes if we're loading up debts on future generations."" Mr Chishti also declared his candidacy on Sunday, speaking about the importance of lower taxes, a small state and a big society. The abundance of tax-cutting plans announced so far, contrasts with Mr Sunak, who has played down the prospect of tax cuts before public finances improve. The former chancellor released a video to launch his campaign, but is yet to set out his economic pitch. He warned against ""comforting fairy tales"" that would ""leave our children worse off tomorrow"". This wide field of candidates could be narrowed down significantly within days. Conservative backbenchers will meet on Monday to finalise the rules and timetable for the contest. They're likely to set a relatively high bar for the number of confirmed supporters needed to enter the first round of voting among MPs. The hopefuls will then have to scramble for backers before nominations close, likely on Tuesday evening. A final two are expected to be chosen by the start of Parliament's summer break on 21 July. Then it's over to the Conservative Party membership to pick the winner and our next prime minister. Writing in the Sun,,externalformer levelling up secretary Michael Gove, who was sacked by Boris Johnson, has endorsed Ms Badenoch's campaign. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng acknowledged public spending cuts would be required if tax cuts were implemented, but refused to say which services would be affected. ""I'm not going to specify cuts at the moment because we've got a leadership contest and I'm sure the leadership contenders will spell that out more clearly,"" he told the Today programme. Mr Zahawi, who became chancellor this week, joined the chorus of leadership hopefuls in calling for lower taxes in an fresh interview with the Telegraph, telling the paper ""nothing is off the table"". Mr Zahawi - who has faced claims that his tax affairs have been investigated - also said he would publish his tax returns should he become one of the final two candidates in the race. Experts have raised questions about the ability of a new prime minister to slash taxes without affecting public spending. Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank, said predictions of a budget surplus of about Â£30bn by 2024 had been calculated at a time when inflation predictions were lower. Writing on Twitter,external, he added that using the headroom to fund tax cuts would ""almost certainly"" require public sector pay cuts or more borrowing. ""Everyone would like lower taxes. But [we] need to be clear about consequences,"" he added. Meanwhile, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has taken aim at the leadership hopefuls for signing up to ""unfunded spending commitments"", describing them as taking part in an ""arms race of fantasy economics"". He has also criticised them for now opposing tax rises introduced by Mr Johnson and Mr Sunak, after voting for them previously. WatchBoris Johnson Quits: What Next & More Questionson iPlayer.

Leadership rivals battle over tax,"This video can not be played Watch: Sajid Javid says tax cuts are needed before growth Conservative leadership hopefuls have been setting out competing plans to cut taxes, as the race to replace Boris Johnson heats up. A flurry of weekend announcements has seen most candidates promise cuts for individuals, businesses, or both. But divisions have opened up over the timing and scale of the proposed reductions. They also mark a contrast with ex-chancellor Rishi Sunak, who has played down the prospect of immediate cuts. Meanwhile the contest has widened further, with Trade Minister Penny Mordaunt becoming the ninth Tory MP to throw her hat into the ring. The Brexit-supporting former defence secretary launched her campaign on Sunday, styling herself as a pragmatist and a team player. Javid and Hunt join Tory leadership race Who could be the next prime minister? Political landscape being re-shaped before our eyes She joins a field of contenders that has increased significantly in recent days, with an official timetable for the contest set to be confirmed next week. As well as Mr Sunak, his successor Nadhim Zahawi, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps, and former health secretaries Sajid Javid and Jeremy Hunt have all launched campaigns for the top job. They join Attorney General Suella Braverman, former equalities minister Kemi Badenoch and backbencher Tom Tugendhat - with Foreign Secretary Liz Truss expected to launch her campaign within the next 24 hours. WatchBoris Johnson Quits: What Next & More Questionson iPlayer. Mr Javid has promised wide-ranging tax cuts, including cancelling next year's scheduled hike in corporation tax from 19% to 25%, and instead gradually reduce it by 1p a year to 15%. He also wants to bring forward next year'splanned 1p cut to income taxand reverse April's National Insurance hike, introduced when he was health secretary to fund the NHS and social care. Speaking on the BBC's Sunday Morning programme, he said those proposed cuts would cost Â£39bn a year. In addition, he also wants to cut fuel duty. Arguing the cuts were required to boost growth in the UK economy, he said not introducing them was a ""much greater risk"". Pressed on how he would fund them, he said he would be setting out details in the coming days, but pointed to official projections of a Â£30bn ""fiscal headroom"" against spending targets by 2024. Penny Mordaunt, the latest candidate to enter the race, has been MP for Portsmouth North since 2010. Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank, said the Â£30bn figure was calculated at a time when inflation predictions were lower. Writing on Twitter,external, he added that using the headroom to fund tax cuts would ""almost certainly"" require public-sector pay cuts or more borrowing. ""Everyone would like lower taxes. But [we] need to be clear about consequences,"" he added. Mr Hunt, a former foreign and health secretary, has set out a rival plan to reduce corporation tax to 15% in one go at the Budget this autumn. He says that, if elected, he would also freeze business rates - a tax on commercial property - for the poorest areas for five years. And in another dividing line with Mr Javid, he has said any cuts to income tax should depend on achieving economic growth first. He also revealed that if he becomes leader he would make Tatton MP Esther McVey - who founded the ""blue collar"" group aiming to target working-class voters - his deputy prime minister. This video can not be played Jeremy Hunt says he wants ""smart tax cuts that grow the economy"" Mr Zahawi, who announced his leadership bid on Saturday, has pledged to cut taxes for ""individuals, families and businesses,"" and Mr Shapps has promised to cut personal tax for the poorest. Responding to newspaper reports that the authorities are looking into his tax affairs, Mr Zahawi issued a statement saying he was not aware of any investigation and described the claims as ""smears"". He added he would ""answer any questions"" HM Revenue and Customs had for him and pledged to publish his tax returns every year, if he becomes prime minister ""to reassure colleagues and the wider public"". Mr Shapps told Sophy Ridge on Sky News he would stop next year's corporation tax rise, and the 1p cut to income tax ""should happen now"". Speaking to the same programme, foreign affairs committee chair Tom Tugendhat said he would reverse the National Insurance rise and reduce ""crippling"" fuel taxes. The slew of tax-cutting plans to have been announced so far mark a contrast with Mr Sunak, who has played down the prospect of tax cuts before public finances improve. The former chancellor has not yet set out his economic pitch for the leadership, promising more details in the coming days and weeks. But in a video launching his campaign, he warned against ""comforting fairy tales"" that would ""leave our children worse off tomorrow"". Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper criticised candidates promising to scrap the National Insurance rise, adding they had not joined Labour inopposing it at the time. ""I don't think any of them have put forward any costed proposals,"" she told the Sunday Morning programme. ""While they've been talking about being a low-tax party, they've all been voting for 15 tax rises,"" she added. Launching her leadership bid earlier, former naval reservist Ms Mordaunt emphasised her teambuilding abilities, adding that leadership should be ""less about the leader and more about the ship"". She is yet to announce a policy platform. However in an early mishap shortly after launching, she posted a new version of her campaign video after paralympian Jonnie Peacock asked for footage of him included in the clip to be removed. A new version of the video was posted around two hours later, with footage of cricketer Jonny Bairstow and the Welsh national football team also removed. The timetable and rules for the leadership contest are expected to be announced next week, with the 1922 Committee of backbench Tory MPs that organises contests meeting late on Monday. It will be a two-stage process, with Conservative MPs whittling down the field to two candidates through successive rounds of voting, before Tory party members choose the winner. While the campaign is yet to formally get under way, Brexit opportunities minister Jacob Rees-Mogg has said people will ""think an election is necessary"" once the race is over. Speaking on Channel 4's Andrew Neil show, he said many candidates would promise they will not call an early general election - but added it was ""highly probable"" one could be held if the polls favour Mr Johnson's successor in the coming months.

"Cambridge University reviewing student deathsFive students have died since March, with one confirmed as suicide and four others suspected.","Cambridge University is looking at the deaths alongside public health bodies Cambridge University is holding a review after five students died in recent months. One of the deaths, which all happened between March and June, has been confirmed as a suicide, while four others are suspected suicides. Senior pro vice-chancellor Prof Graham Virgo said it had ""distressed the whole of the university community"". Learning from an initial review after the first four deaths was being used as part of ongoing plans, he added. A second-year history student died in March 2022, three other students died in May and another died in June. The history student's inquest heard he was ""on course to finish as one of the most accomplished students in his year"". Cambridgeshire and Peterborough assistant coroner Simon Milburn said there was ""absolutely no indication that he was struggling"". The inquest heard he had no contact with college counselling services and his GP confirmed there was no history of mental health issues. If you are feeling emotionally distressed, help and support is available viaBBC Action Line The head of charity Survivors of Suicide, Claire Curran, who has been supporting his family, said: ""Like any family who are bereaved by suicide they are devastated, they are distraught, very traumatised, really struggling to get their heads around what's happened; immense sadness. ""This is not the kind of death that anyone ever wants to experience."" She added it was ""really important"" to let people know there were support services available and to make sure they were accessible when needed. Cambridge University has collated the number of student suicides since 2017-18, according to a Freedom of Information response. Over the four years prior to 2021-22, four students were confirmed to have died by suicide, with one suspected. Prof Graham Virgo said the five deaths had ""distressed the whole of the university community"" Following the fourth death this year, the university approached the NHS and public health agencies to set up an investigation group to ""review what has happened and what the lessons [are] that we can learn,"" Prof Virgo said. ""One thing that came out of the review was that there was no common cause behind these student deaths, but we have, reflecting on the discussions arising from the review, considered various aspects of our practice,"" he said. ""We already have, for example, training relating to suicide prevention and we want to ensure that training is as good as it can possibly be."" The fifth death occurred after the start of that review and is currently under review itself. These reviews are separate from coroner's inquests. Prof Virgo said: ""We consider all the student deaths that have occurred at the University of Cambridge to be tragic and very concerning. We are not in a position to speculate as to what happened in these cases. ""But we are engaging very carefully with the whole student population with professionals within the university and outside to get a better understanding of what might be going on. I am not in a position to say it is one particular cause. ""It is undoubtedly complex, but it is something that we are seeing throughout the country and certainly throughout the university sector."" More students are accessing Cambridge University's mental health services In 2021, 2,123 students accessed the university's central mental health service while 453 used college-based services, compared to 1,655 and 136 respectively in 2017. Ben Dalitz, the student union's welfare and community officer, said that universities had been tasked with creating a suicide prevention policy by the government, but an initial draft of Cambridge's had been ""altered quite a lot"". ""University senior leadership buckled under pressure from the heads of colleges to water down the policy and we've been really quite concerned to see what started as a conversation about student safety turning into one that's really about legal liability,"" they said. Prof Virgo said the university already spends Â£4.5m a year on mental health and wellbeing, and will be allocating an additional Â£5m over the next five years. ""Working together, the University and Colleges have been developing and implementing an action plan, much of which was in development before these tragic deaths, which further enhances the support available for students,"" he said. He said their plans included an ""increase in investment into the university counselling service and dedicated wellbeing advisors in colleges to enable early identification of students in distress"". A spokeswoman from Cambridgeshire and Peterborough Integrated Care System (ICS), which was involved in the review, said: ""We want to express our deepest condolences to the families and our thoughts are with them and friends of those who have been affected. ""We're committed to working together to ensure that we support our most vulnerable people with managing their mental health."" Prof Virgo said the university already spends Â£4.5m a year on mental health and wellbeing and plans to increase that According to the most recent data from the Office of National Statistics (ONS), published in May, the suicide rate for higher education students in the academic year ending 2020 in England and Wales was three deaths per 100,000 students, the lowest rate in four years. Between 2016-17 and 2019-20, students also had a significantly lower suicide rate compared with the general population of similar ages. Prof Steve West, the president of Universities UK, which represents 140 universities, said the sector shares a ""resolute commitment"" to prevent student suicides. ""Across the UK, we are seeing an increase in the number of young adults experiencing mental ill health and this is reflected in student populations, with increasing demand for support and treatment both in universities and the NHS. ""Whilst there is no evidence that overall numbers of student deaths by suicide are increasing, risk factors such as self-harm, depression, debt, disengagement and loneliness mean that universities need to be vigilant to spot the signs and respond quickly."" Ms Curran added the history student's family would say that ""no matter how bad things are, ending your own life is not the answer. ""No family want to go through this pain. No family want to feel this devastation. Please, please, please talk to someone and get some help, because people really do care.""

LiveLiveNew PM and Tory leader to be announced 5 SeptemberLess than a minute ago,"Eight candidates make it onto the ballot for the Conservative Party leadership contest Kemi Badenoch, Suella Braverman, Jeremy Hunt, Penny Mordaunt, Rishi Sunak, Liz Truss, Tom Tugendhat and Nadhim Zahawi received the support of at least 20 MPs Sajid Javid and Rehman Chishti withdraw from the contest just minutes before the deadline Candidates are pitching their bids to fellow Tory MPs at a closed hustings in Westminster. They each have 12 minutes to speak Successful contenders will go through to a vote on Wednesday, with the final two candidates selected before the end of next week The winner will be announced on 5 September Edited by Chris Giles We'll be back tomorrow with the latest updates - please join us then. Today's page was written by Sam Hancock, Dulcie Lee, Emily McGarvey, Aoife Walsh, Thomas Mackintosh, Laura Gozzi, Jasmine Andersson, Jack Burgess and Marita Moloney. It was edited by Nathan Williams, Owen Amos, Lauren Turner, Claire Heald and Chris Giles.   We're pausing our live coverage of the Conservative leadership race soon. But before we go, here's a recap of today's main developments:  We understand the eight candidates who all want to be the next PM have finished speaking to their fellow Tory MPs at tonight's hustings. The leadership contenders were given 12 minutes to make their case ahead of the first round of votes tomorrow. Wednesday is set to be another busy day, with those vying to succeed Boris Johnson facing a vote after PMQs from 13:30 to 15:30 BST. Candidates must secure at least 30 votes each to make it to the next round, with a result expected by early evening. The leadership race will eventually be whittled down to two candidates by the end of next week, after which they will have the summer recess to win the support of the Tory membership before the final result on 5 September. Former Cabinet minister David Davis, who is backing Penny Mordaunt, has denied that leadership candidate Rishi Sunak is ""hated"" by many Tory MPs. Earlier, Davis told BBC Radio 4's PM programme: ""I don't think he's hated at all. ""We need a change of policy. ""If Rishi's going to stick with this policy, which has landed us with a recession and higher-than-average inflation for our economic peers, then I want to change that"". He called the former chancellor a ""perfectly charming, nice individual"". It's been a busy day with Tory MPs voicing their support for the party leadership contenders, with dozens publicly declaring their endorsements of who they'd like the next PM to be. But former Conservative Party leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith is remaining tight-lipped about who he'd like to see take charge. Speaking from the House of Commons where the eight candidates are speaking at hustings tonight, Duncan Smith told Sky News he's been ""impressed"" by all the contenders so far. ""This for once wasn't about Europe, it wasn't directly about taxation but was about how do you work to improve the quality of life for those who are the poorest in society,"" he says. ""It forced candidates to stop the to-and-fro bickering about who will cut taxes and not cut taxes and actually get down to talking about real lives."" Patrick Flynn, political analyst at the betting exchange SMarkets, has been running his figures on who might win this contest, and at what stage all the others will be beaten in the votes by MPs. According to his model, Suella Braverman, Jeremy Hunt, Kemi Badenoch and Nadim Zahawi will be eliminated in the first three ballots among MPs; Tom Tugendhat and Liz Truss will go after that; Rishi Sunak and Penny Mordaunt will make the final two. At that stage, all Conservative Party members are able to vote, with the result due on 5 September. Flynn explained his workings - he looks at how different demographics of MPs have endorsed candidates so far and how those who supported different runners in past contests are shaping up now. He also looks at MPs voting records on social and economic issues and where their constituencies lie on Brexit. While some commentators have predicted a quick falling away of candidates, Flynn suggests we could be in for up to five rounds of voting before two rivals emerge. We're getting some insight from the hustings where eight candidates contesting the Tory leadership race are setting out their stalls. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn is among the reporters gathered in the corridor outside the committee room in the House of Commons. She reports how bookmakers' favourite Rishi Sunak is also keen to get ahead at the hustings, arriving early for his speaking slot. The former chancellor is forced to head away from the committee room while leadership rival Tom Tugendhat takes to the podium. Jeremy Hunt's been talking to LBC Radio, before he headed off to the hustings, now ongoing in Parliament. He says it would be ""immoral"" to offer personal tax cuts as part of a leadership bid, funded from borrowing. He promotes corporate tax cuts. Hunt says he's costed his substantial tax cut pledges and admits ""they are expensive"" - but argues he could ""do this within the fiscal rule that says that debt has to fall as a proportion of GDP over the period"". He argues that while corporation tax cuts are ""not vote winners"", they would lead to economic growth by the time of the next election. Ione WellsPolitical Correspondent, BBC News The hustings are taking place as we speak in a House of Commons committee room. Cameras are not allowed in, so reporters are waiting in the corridor outside. Liz Truss has left after having her allotted 12 minutes to speak. Asked how it was, she says âvery hotâ. In terms of atmosphere or temperature? âEverything!â, comes the reply. Jeremy Hunt has now gone inâ¦ to slightly less banging on tables (the traditional way backbench Tories express their approval). A Tory organiser outside also described the room - saying âitâs absolutely swelteringâ. MP for Gosport Caroline Dinenage says she'll be throwing her weight behind Penny Mordaunt. She's backing her friend and old schoolmate Mordaunt, an arch Brexiteer, even though she herself voted to remain. ""The
fact is she brings people together from across the party, and all the different political views,"" she tells the BBC's Ros Atkins. ""She unites us."" Dinenage also says Mordaunt has made ""fully costed"" pledges, such as cutting the cost of fuel. ""She's not going wild on unfunded commitments,"" she adds.

They are Kemi Badenoch, Suella Braverman, Jeremy Hunt, Penny Mordaunt, Rishi Sunak, Liz Truss, Tom Tugendhat and Nadhim Zahawi. Each has the backing of at least 20 fellow MPs. Former Health Secretary Sajid Javid and Rehman Chishti MP withdrew from the contest just minutes before the deadline. The first ballot and its result happen on Wednesday.

The eight candidates are just about to start speaking at the first hustings in Parliament. They're getting 12 minutes each to try to persuade Conservative MPs they should be the one to take over as party leader and prime minister. They're going to be speaking in this order: Liz Truss, Jeremy Hunt, Tom Tugendhat, Rishi Sunak, Suella Braverman, Kemi Badenoch, Nadhim Zahawim and then Penny Mordaunt. We are not expecting to be able to follow along with the hustings live - it's something just for Tory MPs - but will bring you any reaction as soon as we have it. Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent At the hustings - that begin at 19:00 BST in Parliament - roughly half of the audience will not be persuadable because they've already said who they're backing. Others like Priti Patel and Sajid Javid have said they are yet to make up their minds. But only part of their decision will be based on the performance this evening. Some already have in mind who they might be potentially backing but if someone was to come in with a better job offer dependent on their support, that might persuade them. It's not entirely going to be a merit-based process. Twelve minutes - you probably spend longer looking for a new car or new house than choosing a new prime minister. The hustings may be crucial for a few MPs choosing how to vote - but there will be other considerations, including personal ones, at play. Worth remembering too that we haven't had all of the candidates' campaign launches yet. Penny Mordaunt is due to hold hers tomorrow. Now that eight candidates have secured enough support, the 358 Tory MPs will hold a series of votes until only two candidates remain:  The first ballot will take place on Wednesday 13 July, from 13:30 to 15:30, with the result announced later tomorrow. The final two candidates should be known by the end of next week. After a series of hustings events around the country over the summer - when the remaining two candidates set out their plans - party members will pick the winner in a postal vote. Read more on this story here. We now know that there are eight people officially in the race to be the next Conservative party leader - and the next prime minister. Rishi Sunak, the former chancellor, is now the joint favourite with Penny Mordaunt, according to betting odds. They're followed by Liz Truss, Tom Tugendhat and Kemi Badenoch. We've a handyguide hereas to who joins them in the running. A bit more from Graham Brady. He says the first round ballot will take place on Wednesday, from 13:30 to 15:30. The result will be announced ""as soon as we can after that"", he says. The first hustings are happening in Parliament this evening, starting in just under an hour. The eight candidates will have 12 minutes each to speak, ahead of tomorrow's vote. Any candidate receiving fewer than 30 votes from the 358 Tory MPs will be eliminated in this first round. If all candidates reach that number, the one with the fewest votes is eliminated. Rounds of voting continue until only two candidates remain, then the vote goes out to Conservative Party members across the UK. The final result of that summer ballot, and the name of a new prime minister, comes on 5 September Now we hear from Sir Graham Brady, chairman of the 1922 Committee of backbench MPs. He says eight candidates have been nominated: Kemi Badenoch, Suella Braverman, Jeremy Hunt, Penny Mordaunt, Rishi Sunak, Liz Truss, Tom Tugendhat and Nadhim Zahawi.  Former Health Secretary Sajid Javid withdraws from the contest to be the next Conservative Party leader. He says: ""Serving in government is a true privilege. It has been just seven days since I took the difficult decision to resign from the most important job I have ever had, as health secretary during a pandemic."" ""Since then, I have set out the values and policies I think are right for the future of our great country."" ""I believe the party must now look outwards, not inwards, if we are to win again."" ""There is an abundance of both ideas and talent in our party. One of the candidates will be given the honour of becoming prime minister."" ""I look forward to seeing the debate unfold and to see colleagues working together as a united Conservative Party once the leadership election is concluded."" Â© 2025 BBC.

First fuel in days trickles through to Sri Lankans,"People like these women in Colombo on Monday have queued for kerosene for months - others are cooking on wood fires Limited fuel and gas supplies have resumed in parts of Sri Lanka after a weekend of tumultuous anti-government protests over the economic crisis. Long queues formed at filling stations and community centres across the capital, Colombo, on Monday, thronged by thousands of weary residents. Fresh supplies came as a relief for a city on edge after months of shortages of fuel, food and other basics. The financial crisis is the worst the country has seen since independence. Rampant inflation has made prices soar and the country's foreign currency reserves have all but run out, leaving it struggling to import food, fuel and medicine. Anger and frustration boiled over at the weekend. Tens of thousands of protesters stormed President Gotabaya Rajapaksa's official residence in Colombo on Saturday, after months of protests over his handling of the economy. Crowds also burned down the private residence of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. Neither man was in the buildings when they were stormed. Throngs of protesters stormed President Gotabaya's official residence on Saturday In the Slave Island district of Colombo on Monday, hundreds of people waited for tokens they could redeem for cooking gas after a shipment of liquid petroleum gas arrived in the country on Sunday. An endless line of empty blue gas cylinders wrapped around several tree-lined blocks of apartments. Those at the start of the queue had been waiting for hours. Perched on her gas cylinder, P Selvi Kalachelvi fished out a plastic bag of rotis or flour pancakes from her handbag. It was the only thing she was eating that day. P Selvi Kalachevi says everyone is suffering in the island's crisis ""I've gone six months without cooking gas now. I once waited for four days for kerosene and I still didn't get anything,"" she told the BBC. ""Everyone is suffering, what can we do?"" Cooking gas has been scarce for months, while manypetrol stations had halted sales to ordinary peopletwo weeks ago to conserve fuel for essential vehicles, bringing much of the country to a standstill. Many of those waiting in line were women, desperate to get gas to cook their families' meals after months of relying on chopped wood to light their fires, which they found expensive and impractical. Coupled with the soaring prices of food - some residents said the cost of chicken and beef had quadrupled since the start of the crisis - it's led most people to cut back on meals, eating only twice a day and cooking flour and vegetable dishes. Meat and fish have not been on the menu for months. This video can not be played Watch: Protesters swim in the Sri Lankan president's pool on Saturday There was a stir in the crowd when police officers arrived and announced they only had enough tokens for about 1,000 families. Dozens of anxious residents trailed a policeman as he made his way down the row of cylinders, counting them one by one. He reached the end of the line - there were enough tokens for everyone. Relief flashed across the faces of the crowd. Across town at a Lanka IOC petrol station, soldiers and police officers directed traffic and monitored the line. Quarrels occasionally broke out as drivers jostled in a slow-moving queue. Petrol station attendants filled their tanks while clutching thick wads of cash, as drivers forked out large sums for the fuel. Gayan Kalanda says he and his relatives had spent three days in line this time One tuk-tuk driver told the BBC he had started queueing three days ago, taking turns with his family members to keep watch over their vehicle. Gayan Kalanda said he had to pay 2,500 Sri Lankan rupees ($6.90; Â£5.80) - nearly half a day's earnings - just for five litres of petrol. It was the seventh time he'd had to wait for days for petrol and he was exhausted. ""We just don't feel secure in this country. We're hungry tooâ¦ we just don't have a proper life in Sri Lanka,"" he said. Further back in the queue was Kanishka De Silva, a banker who had taken time off work to get fuel. On his car's dashboard was a slip of paper he had left overnight, with his phone number written on it along with the plea: ""Please call if petrol comes."" ""It's been getting worse and worse,"" he said, pointing at the queue. ""Here we have doctors, bankers, but also tuk-tuk drivers. It's been a common battle, that's why the protests have been so strong. ""I work nearby, so it's fine. But lots of people live on the outskirts and it's been hard to come to work. People have been cycling or walking for hours to come in. ""And those whose livelihoods depend on having petrol, they are the ones suffering."" Inside the palace now full of the people 'Protests have changed thinking for the better' The daily heartbreak of life in a country gone bankrupt Why is Sri Lanka in crisis? In late June, the authorities suspended sales of petrol and diesel at state-run filling stations for non-essential vehicles in an attempt to preserve the country's dwindling fuel stocks. Fury over President Gotabaya's handling of the economy has led to widespread protests The government has been trying to secure fuel on credit from countries including Russia. It has requested emergency financial help, blaming the Covid-19 pandemic, which all but killed off Sri Lanka's tourist trade - one of its biggest foreign currency earners - for the crisis. How war heroes became villains But many experts say economic mismanagement is to blame. The deepening economic crisis saw the president's older brother, Mahinda Rajapaksa, forced to resign as prime minister in May. Both President Rajapaksa and PM Wickremesinghe have indicated they are ready to resign, but the timetable for this to happen remains unclear. Talks are taking place between leaders of political parties aimed at resolving the crisis. The protesters say they won't leave the presidential palace until Mr Rajapaksa resigns. His whereabouts remain unclear.

"Cambridge University reviewing student deathsFive students have died since March, with one confirmed as suicide and four others suspected.Cambridgeshire","Cambridge University is looking at the deaths alongside public health bodies Cambridge University is holding a review after five students died in recent months. One of the deaths, which all happened between March and June, has been confirmed as a suicide, while four others are suspected suicides. Senior pro vice-chancellor Prof Graham Virgo said it had ""distressed the whole of the university community"". Learning from an initial review after the first four deaths was being used as part of ongoing plans, he added. A second-year history student died in March 2022, three other students died in May and another died in June. The history student's inquest heard he was ""on course to finish as one of the most accomplished students in his year"". Cambridgeshire and Peterborough assistant coroner Simon Milburn said there was ""absolutely no indication that he was struggling"". The inquest heard he had no contact with college counselling services and his GP confirmed there was no history of mental health issues. If you are feeling emotionally distressed, help and support is available viaBBC Action Line The head of charity Survivors of Suicide, Claire Curran, who has been supporting his family, said: ""Like any family who are bereaved by suicide they are devastated, they are distraught, very traumatised, really struggling to get their heads around what's happened; immense sadness. ""This is not the kind of death that anyone ever wants to experience."" She added it was ""really important"" to let people know there were support services available and to make sure they were accessible when needed. Cambridge University has collated the number of student suicides since 2017-18, according to a Freedom of Information response. Over the four years prior to 2021-22, four students were confirmed to have died by suicide, with one suspected. Prof Graham Virgo said the five deaths had ""distressed the whole of the university community"" Following the fourth death this year, the university approached the NHS and public health agencies to set up an investigation group to ""review what has happened and what the lessons [are] that we can learn,"" Prof Virgo said. ""One thing that came out of the review was that there was no common cause behind these student deaths, but we have, reflecting on the discussions arising from the review, considered various aspects of our practice,"" he said. ""We already have, for example, training relating to suicide prevention and we want to ensure that training is as good as it can possibly be."" The fifth death occurred after the start of that review and is currently under review itself. These reviews are separate from coroner's inquests. Prof Virgo said: ""We consider all the student deaths that have occurred at the University of Cambridge to be tragic and very concerning. We are not in a position to speculate as to what happened in these cases. ""But we are engaging very carefully with the whole student population with professionals within the university and outside to get a better understanding of what might be going on. I am not in a position to say it is one particular cause. ""It is undoubtedly complex, but it is something that we are seeing throughout the country and certainly throughout the university sector."" More students are accessing Cambridge University's mental health services In 2021, 2,123 students accessed the university's central mental health service while 453 used college-based services, compared to 1,655 and 136 respectively in 2017. Ben Dalitz, the student union's welfare and community officer, said that universities had been tasked with creating a suicide prevention policy by the government, but an initial draft of Cambridge's had been ""altered quite a lot"". ""University senior leadership buckled under pressure from the heads of colleges to water down the policy and we've been really quite concerned to see what started as a conversation about student safety turning into one that's really about legal liability,"" they said. Prof Virgo said the university already spends Â£4.5m a year on mental health and wellbeing, and will be allocating an additional Â£5m over the next five years. ""Working together, the University and Colleges have been developing and implementing an action plan, much of which was in development before these tragic deaths, which further enhances the support available for students,"" he said. He said their plans included an ""increase in investment into the university counselling service and dedicated wellbeing advisors in colleges to enable early identification of students in distress"". A spokeswoman from Cambridgeshire and Peterborough Integrated Care System (ICS), which was involved in the review, said: ""We want to express our deepest condolences to the families and our thoughts are with them and friends of those who have been affected. ""We're committed to working together to ensure that we support our most vulnerable people with managing their mental health."" Prof Virgo said the university already spends Â£4.5m a year on mental health and wellbeing and plans to increase that According to the most recent data from the Office of National Statistics (ONS), published in May, the suicide rate for higher education students in the academic year ending 2020 in England and Wales was three deaths per 100,000 students, the lowest rate in four years. Between 2016-17 and 2019-20, students also had a significantly lower suicide rate compared with the general population of similar ages. Prof Steve West, the president of Universities UK, which represents 140 universities, said the sector shares a ""resolute commitment"" to prevent student suicides. ""Across the UK, we are seeing an increase in the number of young adults experiencing mental ill health and this is reflected in student populations, with increasing demand for support and treatment both in universities and the NHS. ""Whilst there is no evidence that overall numbers of student deaths by suicide are increasing, risk factors such as self-harm, depression, debt, disengagement and loneliness mean that universities need to be vigilant to spot the signs and respond quickly."" Ms Curran added the history student's family would say that ""no matter how bad things are, ending your own life is not the answer. ""No family want to go through this pain. No family want to feel this devastation. Please, please, please talk to someone and get some help, because people really do care.""

Uber lobbied top ministers at undeclared meetings,"The files show George Osborne and Sajid Javid were among those top ministers to meet with Uber Leaked files reveal how Uber lobbied top ministers at undeclared meetings while fighting restrictions to its ride-hailing service in the UK. Documents show then-London mayor Boris Johnson was ""the ultimate target"" of the lobbying strategy. Undeclared meetings with lobbyists expose loopholes in ministerial code, campaigners say. The politicians say that lobbying rules were followed and that all business meetings were declared. A vast cache of 124,000 internal Uber records leaked tothe Guardian,externaland shared with theInternational Consortium of Investigative Journalists,externaland BBC Panorama, reveal how Uber lobbied top politicians for support as the firm bid to disrupt Europe's taxi industry and secure access to the lucrative UK market. UBER FILES:Leak reveals Macron among leaders who helped Uber UBER FILES:Greyballing, kill switches, lobbying - Uber's dark tricks revealed In the UK, Uber's behind-the-scenes campaign went right to the top. The files record a series of meetings between the company, its lobbyists and senior members of the then-government that went undeclared. They include meetings with the current home secretary Priti Patel, Tory leadership contender Sajid Javid, and recently sacked cabinet minister Michael Gove. The revelations are likely to prompt renewed concerns thatregulatory proposals which would have impacted Uber adversely in London, were droppedas government ministers put pressure on Boris Johnson. According to the files, Uber executives later reported that former chancellor George Osborne considered himself ""responsible"" for the ""positive"" outcome. Sue Hawley, chief executive of the campaign group Spotlight on Corruption, said the meetings should have been declared. ""It certainly breaches the spirit of the rules,"" she says, although the rules were sufficiently ambiguous at the time that they may not have been in breach of the letter. ""This is a very, very controversial company. So I think in that context, it is even more extraordinary that these meetings went undeclared by so many ministers,"" she adds. Since its arrival in London in 2012, Uber has been bitterly opposed by black cab drivers who see their fares being undercut and their livelihoods threatened. In 2014 parts of London werebrought to a standstill by cab driversin protests against the US tech firm. Black cab drivers protest in London, May 26, 2015 Mr Johnson was reluctant to engage with Uber directly because the company was so controversial. Yet an internal Uber strategy document in 2014 identified London as ""critical"" to the firm's success and Mr Johnson as ""the ultimate target"" of Uber's influence campaign. ""The Mayor remains the central figure in London governmentâ¦ the need therefore is for a more positive image of Uber to be conveyed to Boris, by people that he trusts and respects."" The Uber Files reveal how that campaign worked. The documents show that in July 2014 Uber lobbyists visited 10 Downing Street to meet then-Prime Minister David Cameron's advisers. Lobbyists reported back to Uber getting ""useful intelligence on Mayor's office"". According to the files, Uber lobbyists were confident their work would bear fruit. An email says that Mr Cameron's ""senior staff are very with us"". The documents show they also met current leadership hopeful Sajid Javid, then Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, and Matt Hancock, then Business Minister, during their visit to No 10. A spokesperson for Mr Javid said the ""relevant departments hold no record of the meeting said to have taken place"". Speaking to the BBC on Monday, during his leadership bid, Mr Javid said any meetings with Uber ""would have been reported"". ""So if they have not been reported in the ministerial transparency declarations, then I didn't have them."" Mr Hancock's spokesperson says it was the policy of government to attract tech companies to the UK and all his efforts were ""above board and declared properly"". The following month, Uber's controversial chief executive Travis Kalanick was invited to a small dinner with George Osborne, then Chancellor of the Exchequer, in California, at the home of a senior Google executive. The invitation came from Rachel Whetstone, wife of Steve Hilton, who was strategy director at the time for Mr Cameron. She had worked with him before at the TV company Carlton and Conservative HQ. At the time of the dinner she was senior vice president of communications and public policy at Google, which also had a major investment in Uber. She moved to Uber the following year. A note from Uber's public policy chief Corey Owens to Mr Kalanick makes it clear that the company regarded this as an opportunity to advance its cause with the chancellor, and not just a social occasion. It reads: ""I think this is worth you doing. We were going to get you in front of Osborne when you're in London, but this is a more private affair, no hanger-on officials or staffers."" Mr Osborne didn't declare the meeting. ""This is someone who is very personally known to the prime minister, opening doors to other ministers,"" Ms Hawley told the BBC. ""And I think that's really, really concerning. And it feeds the perception that big business is setting the government agenda. That's really damaging to our democracy."" Lawyers for Ms Whetstone said the dinner had been arranged ""at the then-chancellor's request to discuss innovation with leaders in Silicon Valley,"" and that she has never taken ""improper advantage of personal relationships with UK politicians"". TheMinisterial Code,externalsets out what UK government ministers should and shouldn't do. Ministers shown to have broken it are normally expected to resign. The 2010 version, which was in force when these meetings occurred, said: ""Ministers meet many people and organisations and consider a wide range of views as part of the formulation of Government policy. Departments will publish, at least quarterly, details of Ministers' external meetings."" By 2015 London's transport authority, TfL, was considering a series of measures which would have significantly dented Uber's competitiveness and stifled its rapid growth, including a minimum five-minute wait between booking a ride and pick-up. At the time, Mr Johnson, who, as mayor had oversight of TfL, revealed how he'd been lobbied to go easy on Uber, writing that he had been deluged by ""rampant, frothing, free-market Conservatives"" opposed to tightening regulations on private-hire vehicles. The files show Uber had continued targeting top Tories, as well as Labour and Lib Dem MPs. That December, in a meeting that was declared, Sajid Javid met executives from Uber who reported that he was ""clearly a supporter"". The same day, Mr Javid met with Mr Johnson and two other cabinet ministers, where he discussed TfL's proposals, according to emails obtained under the Freedom of Information Act and reported by the Daily Mail. Priti Patel, now home secretary, met with an Uber lobbyist in Paris in January 2016, when she was minister of state for employment. The meeting wasn't declared. The files show a follow up letter from the minister proposing a partnership with Uber. A spokesperson for Ms Patel said: ""For official meetings such as this, civil servants are presentâ¦ and responsible for making the appropriate recordings."" Also in January 2016, Michael Gove, then Secretary of State for Justice met with Ms Whetstone, by then Uber's public policy chief. The meeting wasn't declared. A spokesman at Mr Gove's former department said ""no official meeting took place"" in January 2016. That same month TfL proposals which would have hit Uber hardest, were shelved. Uber hailed it as a ""victory for common sense"". When asked in the London Assembly if he had been subject to ""enormous lobbying by the government"" on Uber's behalf, the mayor said hedid ""not deny that"",external. The Uber Files show that shortly after the TfL proposals were shelved, Mr Osborne met Travis Kalanick at the World Economic Forum conference in Davos, Switzerland. This time the meeting was declared. ""George Osborne is a strong advocate,"" an Uber lobbyist noted in an email after that meeting. ""He liked to believe that he's responsible for the positive consultation outcome."" A spokesperson for George Osborne said ""all business meetings where policy affecting individual companies [sic] were properly declared"", adding that far from being secret, it was the government's publicly announced policy to meet tech businesses and persuade them to invest in Britain. The Uber Files is a leak of 124,000 records including emails and texts exposing conversations and meetings between Uber executives and public officials as the technology-driven taxi firm sought to expand its business. The files were leaked tothe Guardian,externalwhich shared them with theInternational Consortium of Investigative Journalists,externalin Washington DC and media partners in 29 countries, including the BBC's Panorama.

Heathrow cuts flights and warns more could comeThe airport asks airlines to cancel 61 flights on Monday and warns of more disruption this summer.Business,"Heathrow Airport has apologised to passengers caught up in recent travel chaos but warned that more flights could be cancelled. The UK's largest airport asked airlines to remove 61 flights from Monday's schedules, as it seeks to cope with soaring demand and staff shortages. Heathrow's boss John Holland-Kaye said the airport would request ""further action if necessary"". Tens of thousands of UK passengers have been affected by travel disruption. Airports and airlines have struggled to recruit staff after shedding jobs during Covid lockdowns as holiday demand has returned. The UK is about to enter the key summer holiday season as schools begin to break up. The government and the aviation regulator wrote to carriers last month telling them to ensure their summer timetables were ""deliverable"". Last week,British Airways said it was cutting 10,300 more short-haul flightsbetween August and the end of October. The announcement, affecting Heathrow, Gatwick and City airports, means nearly 30,000 flights will have been removed from BA's schedule between April and October this year. Will my summer holiday flights be cancelled? What are my rights if my flight is cancelled? Heathrow apologised to passengers affected by ""long queue times, delays for passengers with reduced mobility, bags not travelling with passengers or arriving late"", at times in recent weeks. But it insisted most passengers had a good level of service, despite resourcing challenges at the airport, airlines, ground handlers and government agencies. Mr Holland-Kaye said: ""I am very proud of the way that our team is rising to the challenge of growth, and giving excellent service to the vast majority of passengers. ""However, we have already seen times recently when demand exceeds the capacity of the airport, airlines and ground handlers. ""We will review the schedule changes that airlines have submitted in response to the government's requirement to minimise disruption for passengers this summer and will ask them to take further action if necessary."" Heathrow said it had asked airlines to remove 61 flights from Monday's schedules, because more passengers are expected in Terminals 3 and 5 than the airport can currently serve. Previous ""schedule interventions"" happened following problems with a baggage system, and because more passengers were expected than security staffing could cope with. Heathrow said nearly six million passengers used the airport in June. Another hint that cancellations may not be over, just as the summer holidays are about to take off. Airlines say the advance cancellations they've already made should make the peak schedules more reliable and minimise the chances of last minute disruption. For example, British Airways said last week it would take out more than 10,000 flights, between August and October. It hopes that will be the last such wave of cuts. But Heathrow is clear today it will review airlines' schedule-trimming and ask them to do more if necessary. The airport has already made a number of ""schedule interventions"" at short notice, asking airlines to remove a relatively small number of services the following day. Aviation businesses insist they're doing everything in their control to improve things, but no-one can promise a completely disruption-free summer. The entire aviation sector has struggled to bounce back from the pandemic, during which it cut thousands of jobs as the industry ground to a halt. Now that travel has resumed, airlines are seeking to put on almost as many flights as they did before Covid restrictions were introduced while many aviation businesses, for example ground handlers, are finding it difficult to rehire workers. According to aviation analytics firm Cirium, the number of last-minute flight cancellations from the UK was up 188% in June 2022, compared to June 2019 before the pandemic. Last month, the Department for Transport and the Civil Aviation Authority wrote a joint letter to carriers, telling them to cancel flights they cannot deliver this summer. UK airports saw severe disruption at Easter and May half term Other airlines have also announced cancellations over the busy summer period. Low cost European carrier Wizz Air has said it will reduce its peak summer flight programme in an effort to avoid flight cancellations and delays. The Hungarian airline said it would trim its capacity by a further 5%. Industry bosses have urged the government to allow them to recruit workers from overseas as one potential fix to staff shortages. Writing in the Sunday Times,external, Philipp Joeinig, group chief executive of Menzies Aviation, said ministers should add aviation workers to the shortage occupation list as the country enters the peak travel season. Last month, it was reported thatthis plea had been rejected by the Transport Secretary, Grant Shapps. Are you concerned about booking a holiday? Do you work in the industry?

ScotRail train drivers accept pay increaseTrains have been on a reduced timetable while drivers refused to work overtime during a pay dispute.Scotland,"ScotRail train drivers have voted to accept a 5% pay increase, their union Aslef has announced. Trains across Scotland have been on a reduced timetable for almost two monthsduring a pay dispute. ScotRail said if drivers begin doing overtime again a full timetable could return within 10 days. Around 700 services were cut on 23 May when the dispute began and an emergency timetable was introduced. Aslef Scottish organiser Kevin Lindsay said: ""Following a ballot on the improved offer negotiated with ScotRail, Aslef members have voted to accept the proposals on pay and conditions."" David Simpson, ScotRail service delivery director, said: ""All parties involved have worked hard to find an agreement that recognises the hard work of staff and the financial challenges faced by the railway as we look to recover from the pandemic. ""ScotRail, our staff, and our customers want to have a reliable, efficient, and sustainable railway that supports the economy and connects communities across the country. This deal is a significant step towards delivering that."" Why have hundreds of trains been cancelled? Last train anger after ScotRail timetable cut TRNSMT train warning as Capaldi closes show ScotRail drivers will see their pay climb by 5% and also get more money for rest day and Sunday working, driving instructor and maternity pay along with a policy of no compulsory redundancies for the next five years. The nationalised train operator said 2.2% of the increase would be funded by Transport Scotland with the remaining 2.8% coming from ScotRail's funds. ScotRail came back into public ownership for the first time in 25 years in April, after previous operator Abellio had its franchise ended early over criticism of the quality of the service. The emergency timetable in place since May has had a major impact on evening services and caused travel disruption for a number of events. Fans at Scotland's World Cup play-off against Ukraine at Hampden Park in June had to leave early if they wanted to take the last service home. The emergency timetable had a major impact on evening and weekend trains Audiences at TRNSMT music festival in Glasgow on Sunday were told they would miss last trains home if they stayed to watch headliner Lewis Capaldi. Despite the dispute being resolved, the temporary timetable is expected to in place for up to 10 days while service levels return to normal. Visitors to The Open in St Andrews have also been urged to avoid rail travel this week. Johnnie Cole-Hamilton, director of championships at The R&A, said there was ""a risk that fans who travel by train may find there are no services to get them home"".

Kojima threatens action over Abe shooting hoax,"Hideo Kojima is best known as the creator of the Metal Gear franchise A legendary video game developer has threatened to sue over hoax posts portraying him as Shinzo Abe's killer. Metal Gear creator Hideo Kojima was linked tothe shooting of Japan's former prime ministerin pictures on website 4chan. The images were shared by a French politician andreportedly,externalbroadcast by Greek and Iranian news outlets. Kojima Productions said it ""strongly condemns the spread of fake news and rumours that convey false information"". The 4chan post used a photo of Kojima and falsely labelled him as a ""left-wing extremist"" with a criminal record. It also included a picture of him wearing a type of Ushanka, or fur hat, worn by soldiers in communist Russia, and another of him standing next to a picture of Marxist revolutionary Che Guevara. Watch Newsbeat go behind the scenes at Kojima Productions,external Screenshots on social media showed Damien Rieu, a French politician associated with the country's nationalist movement, had tweeted out images of Kojima with text translated to: ""The far-left kills"".

Mr Abe died last Friday after he was shot with a homemade gun. Police say the suspect, named as Tetsuya Yamagami, 41, has admitted the killing. By Shayan Sardarizadeh, BBC Disinformation journalist In the immediate aftermath of a tragedy, details are often murky and emotions run high. In the absence of reliable information, misleading claims fill the gap, and Mr Abe's assassination wasn't an exception. False claims that the assassination was staged, that Mr Abe wasn't bleeding in pictures, that the man arrested was not the real suspect, and that he was Korean or Chinese, were posted on Japanese social media. But in other parts of the world, the focus was on Mr Kojima and a play on a racist trope about Asians. Arguably the biggest hub of internet subculture, 4chan has been responsible for many false claims and memes. This isn't the first time Mr Kojima has been the target of online misinformation. Posts falsely accusing him of ""aborting and mummifying a baby"" went viral just a few weeks ago in the context of abortion debate in the US. As always, the best practice is to wait for reliable information from relevant authorities and trusted news sources, and avoid sharing unverified claims, no matter how viral they may be. Shinzo Abe celebrated Japan's video games industry when he appeared onstage as Super Mario at the Rio Olympics handover ceremony in 2016 Japan's longest-serving prime minister, who served for a year in 2006 and then again from 2012 to 2020, before stepping down due to health reasons. Abe later revealed that he had suffered a relapse of ulcerative colitis, an intestinal disease. While he was in office, he pushed more assertive policies on defence and foreign policy and wanted to amend Japan's pacifist post-war constitution. On Japanese social media, the hashtag ""We want democracy, not violence"" was trending throughout Friday, with many users expressing their horror and disgust over Mr Abe's killing.

Previous ""schedule interventions"" happened following problems with a baggage system, and because more passengers were expected than security staffing could cope with. Heathrow said nearly six million passengers used the airport in June. Another hint that cancellations may not be over, just as the summer holidays are about to take off. Airlines say the advance cancellations they've already made should make the peak schedules more reliable and minimise the chances of last minute disruption. For example, British Airways said last week it would take out more than 10,000 flights, between August and October. It hopes that will be the last such wave of cuts. But Heathrow is clear today it will review airlines' schedule-trimming and ask them to do more if necessary. The airport has already made a number of ""schedule interventions"" at short notice, asking airlines to remove a relatively small number of services the following day. Aviation businesses insist they're doing everything in their control to improve things, but no-one can promise a completely disruption-free summer. The entire aviation sector has struggled to bounce back from the pandemic, during which it cut thousands of jobs as the industry ground to a halt. Now that travel has resumed, airlines are seeking to put on almost as many flights as they did before Covid restrictions were introduced while many aviation businesses, for example ground handlers, are finding it difficult to rehire workers. According to aviation analytics firm Cirium, the number of last-minute flight cancellations from the UK was up 188% in June 2022, compared to June 2019 before the pandemic. Last month, the Department for Transport and the Civil Aviation Authority wrote a joint letter to carriers, telling them to cancel flights they cannot deliver this summer. UK airports saw severe disruption at Easter and May half term Other airlines have also announced cancellations over the busy summer period. Low cost European carrier Wizz Air has said it will reduce its peak summer flight programme in an effort to avoid flight cancellations and delays. The Hungarian airline said it would trim its capacity by a further 5%. Industry bosses have urged the government to allow them to recruit workers from overseas as one potential fix to staff shortages. Writing in the Sunday Times,external, Philipp Joeinig, group chief executive of Menzies Aviation, said ministers should add aviation workers to the shortage occupation list as the country enters the peak travel season. Last month, it was reported thatthis plea had been rejected by the Transport Secretary, Grant Shapps. Are you concerned about booking a holiday? Do you work in the industry?

"Boy, 16, dies after going swimming in quarry","The boy was pronounced dead at the scene at East Quarry A 16-year-old boy has died after going swimming at an abandoned quarry. Police said he ""got into difficulty"" after getting into the water at Dawber Delph in Appley Bridge, Lancashire, at 21:40 BST on Saturday. His body was recovered from the water following a search of the quarry. Two other teenage boys havepreviously drowned at the same site. It comes asforecasters warn of rising temperaturesand the Met Office predicts the ""hottest day of the year"". Councillor John Fillis, of Lancashire County Council, said there had been concerns for years over people using East Quarry during the summer. ""When it's hot weather, people come either by train or parents drop them off as that is where they swam,"" he said. ""Local people either want access restricted further or it filled in."" West Lancashire MP Rosie Cooper has called for Lancashire County Council to facilitate the ""urgent and immediate draining"" of the quarry following the boy's death. ""Although the police, owners and local authorities have consistently done what they can to secure this quarry to advise and prevent people from swimming in the lake, the size of the site has proved this difficult. She said whenever there was a period of good weather people continued to swim in the quarry despite the warnings. ""The quarry must now be drained as a matter of urgency,"" she said. Police said the teenager got into difficulty after going into the water at the abandoned quarry Lancashire Police have confirmed the boy's death was not being treated as suspicious and a file would be passed to the coroner. Beckie Ramsay, who has campaigned to raise awareness of the dangers of swimming in cold water following the death of her son in 2011, toldBBC North West Tonight: ""We need everyone to understand the risks, the dangers."" Her son Dylan Ramsay, 13,drowned at a quarry in Lancashire in 2011. The mother of Dylan Ramsay, who drowned in a quarry in 2011, wants to raise awareness of the dangers Ms Ramsay said: ""We need people to know how cold water affects the human body and that we are not invincible.

Sri Lankan PM confirms president to resign,"Mr Rajapaksa's location is currently undisclosed Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa has confirmed he will resign, the prime minister's office has said, after tens of thousands of protesters stormed the official residences of both men. Sri Lanka is in deep financial crisis and the crowds say they won't leave until both men quit their posts. The parliament Speaker had earlier said the president would resign on 13 July. Mr Rajapaksa, whose whereabouts are unknown, has not spoken publicly since his residence was stormed on Saturday. Relief as limited fuel sales resume He was moved to safety before protesters entered the presidential palace. This video can not be played Watch: Protesters storm Sri Lankan president's palace in Colombo, swam in the pool and set the PM's house on fire The president has been blamed for the country's economic mismanagement, which has caused dire shortages of food, fuel and medicine for months. His resignation was first announced by the parliament Speaker on Saturday, but many Sri Lankans responded with scepticism to the idea that he would relinquish power. On Monday, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe's office said in a statement it had been informed by Mr Rajapaksa that he would step down on Wednesday. But under Sri Lanka's constitution, his resignation can only formally be accepted when he resigns by letter to the Speaker - which has yet to happen. Prime Minister Wickremesinghe had earlier also said he would step down from his position. His house was set on fire during Saturday's unrest. Anbarasan Ethirajan, BBC News, Colombo At the president's office in Colombo a huge queue stretches to the end of the road as thousands of people wait to see how their rulers have been operating. Men, women, children are all going to inside to have a look. The president's residence is one of the symbols of power in this country and one of the most protected buildings. These people believe that they have won - that people power has triumphed in ousting the president and prime minister from power. But those things haven't happened yet - even though the president has indicated that he will step down on Wednesday. Unless he resigns formally, it is going to be a long, drawn-out battle.

Inside the presidential palace now full of Sri Lankans The daily heartbreak of life in a country gone bankrupt 'Protests have changed thinking for the better' What's behind Sri Lanka's petrol shortage? Other politicians in Sri Lanka met on Sunday to discuss how to handle a smooth transition of power. The speaker of Sri Lanka's parliament told the BBC World Service Newshour programme a new cross-party coalition government would need to be formed within a week of the president officially stepping down. ""The next couple of days are going to be extremely uncertain times as to see what transpires politically,"" political analyst and human rights lawyer Bhavani Fonseka told Reuters news agency, adding that it would be interesting to see if the two leaders ""actually resign"". Sri Lanka is an island nation off southern India: It won independence from British rule in 1948. Three ethnic groups - Sinhalese, Tamil and Muslim - make up 99% of the country's 22 million population. One family of brothers has dominated for years: Mahinda Rajapaksa became a hero among the majority Sinhalese in 2009 when his government defeated Tamil separatist rebels after years of bitter and bloody civil war. His brother Gotabaya, who was defence secretary at the time, is the current president but says he is standing down. Presidential powers:The president is the head of state, government and the military in Sri Lanka but does share a lot of executive responsibilities with the prime minister, who heads up the ruling party in parliament. Now an economic crisis has led to fury on the streets: Soaring inflation has meant some foods, medication and fuel are in short supply, there are rolling blackouts and ordinary people have taken to the streets in anger with many blaming the Rajapaksa family and their government for the situation. Protesters made their way into the house, chanting slogans and waving the national flag on Saturday The palace storming on Saturday was the culmination of months of mainly peaceful protests in Sri Lanka at the soaring cost of living and shortages of essentials. Huge crowds converged on the official residence of President Rajapaksa, chanting slogans and waving the national flag before breaking through the barricades and entering the property. Footage online showed people roaming through the house and swimming in the president's pool, while others emptied out a chest of drawers, picked through the president's belongings and used his luxurious bathroom. Mr Rajapaksa vacated his official residence on Friday as a safety precaution ahead of the planned protests, two defence ministry sources said, according to Reuters. Although it is Mr Rajapaksa's official residence, he usually sleeps at a separate house nearby. His brother, former Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, is at a naval base in the country, the sources say. The daily heartbreak of life in a country gone bankrupt Why is Sri Lanka in crisis?

Relief in Sri Lanka as limited fuel sales resume,"People like these women in Colombo on Monday have queued for kerosene for months - others are cooking on wood fires Limited fuel and gas supplies have resumed in parts of Sri Lanka after a weekend of tumultuous anti-government protests over the economic crisis. Long queues formed at filling stations and community centres across the capital, Colombo, on Monday, thronged by thousands of weary residents. Fresh supplies came as a relief for a city on edge after months of shortages of fuel, food and other basics. The financial crisis is the worst the country has seen since independence. Rampant inflation has made prices soar and the country's foreign currency reserves have all but run out, leaving it struggling to import food, fuel and medicine. Anger and frustration boiled over at the weekend. Tens of thousands of protesters stormed President Gotabaya Rajapaksa's official residence in Colombo on Saturday, after months of protests over his handling of the economy. Crowds also burned down the private residence of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. Neither man was in the buildings when they were stormed. Throngs of protesters stormed President Gotabaya's official residence on Saturday In the Slave Island district of Colombo on Monday, hundreds of people waited for tokens they could redeem for cooking gas after a shipment of liquid petroleum gas arrived in the country on Sunday. An endless line of empty blue gas cylinders wrapped around several tree-lined blocks of apartments. Those at the start of the queue had been waiting for hours. Perched on her gas cylinder, P Selvi Kalachelvi fished out a plastic bag of rotis or flour pancakes from her handbag. It was the only thing she was eating that day. P Selvi Kalachevi says everyone is suffering in the island's crisis ""I've gone six months without cooking gas now. I once waited for four days for kerosene and I still didn't get anything,"" she told the BBC. ""Everyone is suffering, what can we do?"" Cooking gas has been scarce for months, while manypetrol stations had halted sales to ordinary peopletwo weeks ago to conserve fuel for essential vehicles, bringing much of the country to a standstill. Many of those waiting in line were women, desperate to get gas to cook their families' meals after months of relying on chopped wood to light their fires, which they found expensive and impractical. Coupled with the soaring prices of food - some residents said the cost of chicken and beef had quadrupled since the start of the crisis - it's led most people to cut back on meals, eating only twice a day and cooking flour and vegetable dishes. Meat and fish have not been on the menu for months. This video can not be played Watch: Protesters swim in the Sri Lankan president's pool on Saturday There was a stir in the crowd when police officers arrived and announced they only had enough tokens for about 1,000 families. Dozens of anxious residents trailed a policeman as he made his way down the row of cylinders, counting them one by one. He reached the end of the line - there were enough tokens for everyone. Relief flashed across the faces of the crowd. Across town at a Lanka IOC petrol station, soldiers and police officers directed traffic and monitored the line. Quarrels occasionally broke out as drivers jostled in a slow-moving queue. Petrol station attendants filled their tanks while clutching thick wads of cash, as drivers forked out large sums for the fuel. Gayan Kalanda says he and his relatives had spent three days in line this time One tuk-tuk driver told the BBC he had started queueing three days ago, taking turns with his family members to keep watch over their vehicle. Gayan Kalanda said he had to pay 2,500 Sri Lankan rupees ($6.90; Â£5.80) - nearly half a day's earnings - just for five litres of petrol. It was the seventh time he'd had to wait for days for petrol and he was exhausted. ""We just don't feel secure in this country. We're hungry tooâ¦ we just don't have a proper life in Sri Lanka,"" he said. Further back in the queue was Kanishka De Silva, a banker who had taken time off work to get fuel. On his car's dashboard was a slip of paper he had left overnight, with his phone number written on it along with the plea: ""Please call if petrol comes."" ""It's been getting worse and worse,"" he said, pointing at the queue. ""Here we have doctors, bankers, but also tuk-tuk drivers. It's been a common battle, that's why the protests have been so strong. ""I work nearby, so it's fine. But lots of people live on the outskirts and it's been hard to come to work. People have been cycling or walking for hours to come in. ""And those whose livelihoods depend on having petrol, they are the ones suffering."" Inside the palace now full of the people 'Protests have changed thinking for the better' The daily heartbreak of life in a country gone bankrupt Why is Sri Lanka in crisis? In late June, the authorities suspended sales of petrol and diesel at state-run filling stations for non-essential vehicles in an attempt to preserve the country's dwindling fuel stocks. Fury over President Gotabaya's handling of the economy has led to widespread protests The government has been trying to secure fuel on credit from countries including Russia. It has requested emergency financial help, blaming the Covid-19 pandemic, which all but killed off Sri Lanka's tourist trade - one of its biggest foreign currency earners - for the crisis. How war heroes became villains But many experts say economic mismanagement is to blame. The deepening economic crisis saw the president's older brother, Mahinda Rajapaksa, forced to resign as prime minister in May. Both President Rajapaksa and PM Wickremesinghe have indicated they are ready to resign, but the timetable for this to happen remains unclear. Talks are taking place between leaders of political parties aimed at resolving the crisis. The protesters say they won't leave the presidential palace until Mr Rajapaksa resigns. His whereabouts remain unclear.

"Germany fears Russia gas cut may become permanentRussian pipeline operators say maintenance work is needed, but Germany suspects political motives.Europe","Nord Stream 1 facilities in Lubmin, Germany Russian natural gas supplies to Germany via the Baltic Sea pipeline Nord Stream 1 have been halted for 10 days for annual maintenance work. But German Economy Minister Robert Habeck warned that EU countries had to be prepared in case gas shipments did not resume. He has accused the Kremlin of using gas ""as a weapon"" in response to EU sanctions over the war in Ukraine. Mr Habeck admitted Germany had become too dependent on Russian gas. He described that as ""a grave political mistake as we can see today, which we are trying to remedy as quickly as we possibly can"". He said two floating terminals for deliveries of liquefied natural gas (LNG) would be ready by the end of the year. In mid-June Russia's state gas firm Gazprom cut gas flows through Nord Stream 1 to just 40% of the pipeline's capacity. It blamed a delay in the return of equipment being serviced by Germany's Siemens Energy. The Canadian government says it will now return a repaired Siemens turbine to Germany for the pipeline. That move angered the Ukrainian government, which accused Canada of adjusting the sanctions imposed on Moscow ""to the whims of Russia"". Canada says it is granting Siemens Canada a ""time-limited and revocable permit"" to send repaired turbines back to Germany, despite the sanctions. Germany's government is worried that gas supplies could be reduced or cut permanently. Pipeline maintenance is normal every summer, when gas demand is lower than in winter, but the worry is that Russia may not turn the taps back on. The pipeline shutdown is also affecting Italy, where energy group Eni said it would receive about a third less gas from Russia's Gazprom on Monday compared with average volumes supplied over the past few days. The head of the International Energy Agency, Fatih Birol, has warned that Russia may cut off gas supplies to Europe entirely and that Europe needs to prepare now. Can the world cope without Russian oil and gas? Europe told to prepare for Russia turning off gas Russia has already cut gas supplies to Poland, Bulgaria, the Netherlands, Denmark and Finland over their refusal to comply with a new payment scheme. Austria and the Czech Republic get some gas from Nord Stream 1, but Russian gas also flows to them via a Ukraine pipeline. Visiting Prague, Mr Habeck signed an agreement with the Czech Republic pledging mutual help in the event of a sharp drop in Russian gas supplies. Germany's Robert Habeck (L) spoke in Prague, where he met his Czech counterpart Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February,Germany has reduced its dependence on Russian gasfrom 55% to 35% and wants to stop using gas from Russia altogether. Last year the other main suppliers of natural gas to Germany were Norway (31%) and the Netherlands (13%). Germany is now getting more gas from them, since reducing imports from Russia. The government has also given the go-ahead for Germany's first LNG terminal to be built, at Wilhelmshaven. Another undersea Baltic pipeline from Russia, Nord Stream 2, has been built, but plans to pump gas through it are now on hold because of the war. If Russian supplies were suddenly cut overnight, this could tip Germany into a major recession, because entire industries rely on gas and most German homes use it for heating. A leading energy market analyst, Henning Gloystein of Eurasia Group, warned that ""if Nord Stream 1 doesn't come back on at all, let's say by early August, we think that the German government will have to raise its gas alert level to the third level, which is the maximum level"". ""That would be suspending the wholesale gas market and the government and regulator stepping in as the distributor of natural gas.  So that will effectively mean rationing next winter. What happens in Germany, sadly, will spread over to the rest of Europe if it gets bad, because of the geographical location in the middle of the EU,"" he told the BBC. Germany's gas storage facilities are currently about 64% full, German broadcaster ZDF reports. Industry experts quoted by German media say the chemicals sector would be hardest hit by a gas shortage. It accounts for 15% of Germany's gas consumption, and disruption could lead to shortages of goods such as fertiliser, pharmaceuticals, detergent and cosmetics. German households and key services such as hospitals will be prioritised for gas supplies under a government emergency plan.

Squirrel contraceptives to tackle tide of greys,"The UK's native red squirrel - driven close to extinction by invasive grey squirrels A plan to use oral contraceptives to control grey squirrel populations in the UK is making good progress and could soon be put to the test in field trials, say government scientists. The mass birth control plan involves luring grey squirrels into feeding boxes only they can access, using pots containing hazelnut spread. These will be spiked with contraceptives. The project could help eradicate the grey squirrel in the UK without killing them, says environment minister Lord Benyon. It should reduce the ""untold damage"" grey squirrels do to woodland ecosystems and native red squirrel populations, he says. Invasive oyster expansion threatens estuaries Volunteers sought to pull out invasive plant Invasive weed found in 270 places in Jersey The government scientists leading the research say the contraceptive, which makes both male and female grey squirrels infertile, should be ready to deploy in the wild within two years. Grey squirrels, first introduced from North America in the late 19th century, damage UK woodlands by stripping bark from trees to get at the nutritious sap beneath. The species has flourished in the UK.  There are now reckoned to be 2.7 million grey squirrels here. The animals target young trees, typically 10-50 years old, and favour broadleaf species including oak, beech, sweet chestnut, and sycamore. They can kill or maim trees, leaving scarring that allows an entry point for other tree pests and diseases which can stunt their growth. The damage they can do threatens the effectiveness of government efforts to tackle climate change by planting tens of thousands of hectares of new woodlands,environment minister Lord Goldsmith has warned. The grey squirrel - ""a widespread and extremely numerous invasive animal"" according to broadcaster and naturalist Chris Packham Grey squirrels have also driven the UK's native red squirrel to the verge of extinction across much of the country. There are thought to be just 160,000 red squirrels left in the UK, with only 15,000 remaining in England. Grey squirrels are significantly larger and stronger than reds and carry a squirrel pox virus that is deadly to reds but to which they are immune. The traditional way of managing the grey squirrel population is by culling them. But grey squirrels breed rapidly and populations can recover quickly.  A century of culling programmes has failed to reduce the population. Dosing the animals with a contraceptive drug is a more humane alternative and will ultimately be more effective, says the lead scientist on the project, Dr Giovanna Massei, from the government's Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA). She says her team have developed a vaccine that prompts the immune system to restrict the production of sex hormones, which leaves both male and female squirrels infertile. The drug is not permanent, and further tests are being carried out to find a dose that has a long-lasting effect and is safe to use in the wild. The team have also developed a special feeding hopper with a weighted door designed to keep out species other than squirrels. Trials in Yorkshire and Wales showed 70 per cent of squirrels in each wood visited the bait boxes over a four day period - the only other animals that got in were two particularly enterprising mice. The plan is to bait the hoppers with pots of a hazelnut paste greys find ""irresistible"" and which will be laced with the new contraceptive. The scientists are also exploring special feeders to be used in areas where there are both red and grey squirrels.  These will be triggered by a plate which weighs the animals and only lets the heavier greys get access to the bait. Special feeding hoppers are being designed to administer the contraceptives Dr Massei says computer modelling shows the contraceptive method could bring grey squirrel populations to the brink of extinction in some places. ""It could even eradicate them from some areas, provided you can do a coordinated control over an area, so they don't start to re-immigrate"", Dr Massei says. If the work with grey squirrels is successful Dr Massei believes similar techniques could be used to help control the population of other invasive mammals including rats, mice, deer, and wild boar. The research is being funded by the UK Squirrel Accord (UKSA), a partnership of forestry and conservation organisations. It has raised just over Â£1m to cover the research and development of the project. The contraceptive scheme is an important additional non-lethal tool for managing grey squirrels, says Kay Haw, the director of the UKSA. ""Red squirrels now only survive in island ecosystems where there aren't any grey squirrels or where a red squirrel community group are working hard to keep back the grey squirrels"", she says. Contraceptives - a non-lethal way of controlling grey squirrel populations The financial cost of the damage grey squirrels dois estimated at Â£37m a year in England and Wales alone,external. The cost to the UK's biodiversity has not been calculated. A mature oak tree can support up to 2,000 other species. The initiative has wide support, including from the Prince of Wales, who was instrumental in the setting up of the UKSA. The animal rights pressure group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals says if population control has to be implemented, it backs non-lethal options. But it cautions: ""We mustn't forget that grey squirrels and other species deemed ""invasive"" are where they are through no fault of their own and entirely due to human carelessness, and they deserve to be left in peace."" The broadcaster and naturalist Chris Packham believes a species-specific oral contraceptive could be a ""dream ticket"" if it proves to be economically viable and practical. He describes the project as ""non-violent direct action"" to control ""a widespread and extremely numerous invasive animal"" and suggests an effort should also be made to encourage pine martens back into their previous haunts across the country. These predatory mammals - a native UK species that has suffered historic persecution -have been shown to reverse the spread of invasive grey squirrels in Scotland and Northern Ireland,external.

Woman stabbed in back by masked man on bike,"Police want help identifying this man A woman has been stabbed in the back by a cyclist in the same area of east London where Zara Aleena was killed. The stabbing victim, 27, was hospitalised after the attack on St Johns Road, Ilford. Police want to speak to a man on a green bike and dressed in black. Ch Insp Chris Byrne said: ""I know that this attack on a woman, coming so soon after the tragic murder of Zara Aleena, will be of great concern to Londoners and particularly to people in Ilford.""

Sri Lankan president confirms resignation to PM,"Mr Rajapaksa's location is currently undisclosed Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa has confirmed he will resign, the prime minister's office has said, after tens of thousands of protesters stormed the official residences of both men. Sri Lanka is in deep financial crisis and the crowds say they won't leave until both men quit their posts. The parliament Speaker had earlier said the president would resign on 13 July. Mr Rajapaksa, whose whereabouts are unknown, has not spoken publicly since his residence was stormed on Saturday. Relief as limited fuel sales resume He was moved to safety before protesters entered the presidential palace. This video can not be played Watch: Protesters storm Sri Lankan president's palace in Colombo, swam in the pool and set the PM's house on fire The president has been blamed for the country's economic mismanagement, which has caused dire shortages of food, fuel and medicine for months. His resignation was first announced by the parliament Speaker on Saturday, but many Sri Lankans responded with scepticism to the idea that he would relinquish power. On Monday, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe's office said in a statement it had been informed by Mr Rajapaksa that he would step down on Wednesday. But under Sri Lanka's constitution, his resignation can only formally be accepted when he resigns by letter to the Speaker - which has yet to happen. Prime Minister Wickremesinghe had earlier also said he would step down from his position. His house was set on fire during Saturday's unrest. Anbarasan Ethirajan, BBC News, Colombo At the president's office in Colombo a huge queue stretches to the end of the road as thousands of people wait to see how their rulers have been operating. Men, women, children are all going to inside to have a look. The president's residence is one of the symbols of power in this country and one of the most protected buildings. These people believe that they have won - that people power has triumphed in ousting the president and prime minister from power. But those things haven't happened yet - even though the president has indicated that he will step down on Wednesday. Unless he resigns formally, it is going to be a long, drawn-out battle. Read more from Anbarasan -Inside the palace full of Sri Lankans Inside the occupied palace on Sunday, protesters were refusing to budge until the president leaves. ""I feel sad,"" said Nirosha Sudarshini Hutchinson, who was visiting the compound with her two teenage daughters.

Inside the presidential palace now full of Sri Lankans The daily heartbreak of life in a country gone bankrupt 'Protests have changed thinking for the better' What's behind Sri Lanka's petrol shortage? Other politicians in Sri Lanka met on Sunday to discuss how to handle a smooth transition of power. The speaker of Sri Lanka's parliament told the BBC World Service Newshour programme a new cross-party coalition government would need to be formed within a week of the president officially stepping down. ""The next couple of days are going to be extremely uncertain times as to see what transpires politically,"" political analyst and human rights lawyer Bhavani Fonseka told Reuters news agency, adding that it would be interesting to see if the two leaders ""actually resign"". Sri Lanka is an island nation off southern India: It won independence from British rule in 1948. Three ethnic groups - Sinhalese, Tamil and Muslim - make up 99% of the country's 22 million population. One family of brothers has dominated for years: Mahinda Rajapaksa became a hero among the majority Sinhalese in 2009 when his government defeated Tamil separatist rebels after years of bitter and bloody civil war. His brother Gotabaya, who was defence secretary at the time, is the current president but says he is standing down. Presidential powers:The president is the head of state, government and the military in Sri Lanka but does share a lot of executive responsibilities with the prime minister, who heads up the ruling party in parliament. Now an economic crisis has led to fury on the streets: Soaring inflation has meant some foods, medication and fuel are in short supply, there are rolling blackouts and ordinary people have taken to the streets in anger with many blaming the Rajapaksa family and their government for the situation. Protesters made their way into the house, chanting slogans and waving the national flag on Saturday The palace storming on Saturday was the culmination of months of mainly peaceful protests in Sri Lanka at the soaring cost of living and shortages of essentials. Huge crowds converged on the official residence of President Rajapaksa, chanting slogans and waving the national flag before breaking through the barricades and entering the property. Footage online showed people roaming through the house and swimming in the president's pool, while others emptied out a chest of drawers, picked through the president's belongings and used his luxurious bathroom. Mr Rajapaksa vacated his official residence on Friday as a safety precaution ahead of the planned protests, two defence ministry sources said, according to Reuters. Although it is Mr Rajapaksa's official residence, he usually sleeps at a separate house nearby. His brother, former Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, is at a naval base in the country, the sources say. The daily heartbreak of life in a country gone bankrupt Why is Sri Lanka in crisis?

Truss enters Tory race to replace Johnson,"Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has joined the race to replace Boris Johnson. Declaring her plans inthe Daily Telegraph,external, Ms Truss pledged to start cutting taxes ""from day one"". Many of the 11 leadership hopefuls looking to become the Tory party leader have set out competing tax plans as a core element of their proposals. Mr Johnson said he would not be endorsing anyone as his successor, as he preferred leaving the candidates to ""get on with it"". The 1922 Committee of backbench Tory MPs which organises Conservative leadership contests will meet on Monday to decide the timetable and rules of the race. The two-stage process will see Tory MPs whittle down the candidates to two, through voting rounds, before party members decide the winner to become new Conservative party leader and prime minister. Analysis: Tax cut competition could turn ugly Tories using fantasy economics, Labour leader says Who could be the next prime minister? Political landscape being re-shaped before our eyes Ms Truss indicated that she would echo her rivals in planning to slash corporation tax, reverse the National Insurance hike and reform business rates. She wrote that it ""isn't right to be putting up taxes now"" and if elected she would take ""immediate action"" to assist with living costs. The foreign secretary said she would ""fight the election as a Conservative and govern as a Conservative"". The candidates for Tory leader, and prime minister, who have declared so far are: former equalities minister Kemi Badenoch Attorney General Suella Braverman newly-appointed Foreign Office minister Rehman Chishti former Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt former Health Secretary Sajid Javid Trade minister Penny Mordaunt Transport Secretary Grant Shapps former Chancellor Rishi Sunak Foreign Secretary Liz Truss backbencher Tom Tugendhat Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi Home Secretary Priti Patel is also believed to be weighing up whether to run. Speaking for the first time since he announced his resignation last week, Mr Johnson said: ""The job of the prime minister at this stage is to let the party decide [its new leader], let them get on with it and to continue delivering on the projects that we were elected to deliver."" ""Whatever happens and whoever takes over, there is a great, great agenda to be continued,"" he added. Taxation has emerged as a key policy area for many of the candidates, but questions have been raised about how cuts will be paid for, and whether spending plans will be slashed. Interviewed on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Tugendhat said he would be ""looking to lower taxes across every aspect of society"", adding that he had been ""one of a few Conservative MPs who didn't vote for the National Insurance rise"", which he called a ""tax on jobs"". He said the UK needed to be ""going for growth"" - which he insisted could only be achieved by taking ""the brakes off the economy"" and boosting the private sector. Mr Tugendhat also pledged to ""deliver the benefits"" of Brexit, saying he would open up trade agreements and change ""the way we invest around the country"". Meanwhile, Mr Hunt told BBC Breakfast he would ""get the British economy going"", having served ""at the coalface"" by setting up his own business. ""We need to have a lower-tax environment to help businesses get off the ground,"" he added, which would include cutting corporation tax. Mr Hunt said it was possible to do this ""within our fiscal rules if we spread them over a five-year period, which means that our national debt continues to fall as a proportion of our output"". ""And I think that's not just right; it's moral,"" he said. ""We shouldn't be cutting taxes if we're loading up debts on future generations."" Mr Chishti also declared his candidacy on Sunday, speaking about the importance of lower taxes, a small state and a big society. The abundance of tax-cutting plans announced so far, contrasts with Mr Sunak, who has played down the prospect of tax cuts before public finances improve. The former chancellor released a video to launch his campaign, but is yet to set out his economic pitch. He warned against ""comforting fairy tales"" that would ""leave our children worse off tomorrow"". This wide field of candidates could be narrowed down significantly within days. Conservative backbenchers will meet on Monday to finalise the rules and timetable for the contest. They're likely to set a relatively high bar for the number of confirmed supporters needed to enter the first round of voting among MPs. The hopefuls will then have to scramble for backers before nominations close, likely on Tuesday evening. A final two are expected to be chosen by the start of Parliament's summer break on 21 July. Then it's over to the Conservative Party membership to pick the winner and our next prime minister. Writing in the Sun,,externalformer levelling up secretary Michael Gove, who was sacked by Boris Johnson, has endorsed Ms Badenoch's campaign. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng acknowledged public spending cuts would be required if tax cuts were implemented, but refused to say which services would be affected. ""I'm not going to specify cuts at the moment because we've got a leadership contest and I'm sure the leadership contenders will spell that out more clearly,"" he told the Today programme. Mr Zahawi, who became chancellor this week, joined the chorus of leadership hopefuls in calling for lower taxes in an fresh interview with the Telegraph, telling the paper ""nothing is off the table"". Mr Zahawi - who has faced claims that his tax affairs have been investigated - also said he would publish his tax returns should he become one of the final two candidates in the race. Experts have raised questions about the ability of a new prime minister to slash taxes without affecting public spending. Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank, said predictions of a budget surplus of about Â£30bn by 2024 had been calculated at a time when inflation predictions were lower. Writing on Twitter,external, he added that using the headroom to fund tax cuts would ""almost certainly"" require public sector pay cuts or more borrowing. ""Everyone would like lower taxes. But [we] need to be clear about consequences,"" he added. Meanwhile, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has taken aim at the leadership hopefuls for signing up to ""unfunded spending commitments"", describing them as taking part in an ""arms race of fantasy economics"". He has also criticised them for now opposing tax rises introduced by Mr Johnson and Mr Sunak, after voting for them previously. WatchBoris Johnson Quits: What Next & More Questionson iPlayer.

Birmingham airport flights delayed longest in 2021But punctuality improved across all UK airports due to fewer flights caused by Covid restrictions.Business,"Flights from Birmingham Airport had the longest delays in 2021, analysis of Civil Aviation Authority data suggests. Planes left 12 minutes and 24 seconds late from Birmingham on average in 2021, which was followed by Southampton, Heathrow, Exeter and Aberdeen. The ranking takes into account all scheduled and chartered departures, but cancelled flights are not included. Birmingham said many delayed departures were able to make up time in the air. This was because of a huge reduction in flight numbers due to the coronavirus pandemic. A spokesman said that last year was ""a dark time for aviation"", adding that Birmingham Airport was reduced to just a quarter of normal staffing and capacity due to Covid. But he said ""massive air traffic reductions"", meant that ""flights taking off late were able to catch up en route"". Birmingham serves long-haul destinations including Dubai, Mexico, the Caribbean and the US, as well as more than 100 short-haul routes, and is the UK's seventh busiest airport. It hosts bases for airlines such as Jet2.com, Ryanair and Tui Airways. Birmingham Airport chief executive gets 49% pay rise Flights will be more expensive, says IATA's Willie Walsh The BBC reported in June that the annual wage of the airport's chief executive Nick Barton rose by 49% from Â£399,000 to Â£595,000 last year, angering trade unions. The increase came after large-scale job cuts in the sector in the wake of the pandemic, but the airport - which is part-owned by several of the region's councils - said its senior managers were paid in line with market rates. The airport was used by 12.6 million passengers in 2019, before the pandemic, but just 2.5 million last year. The Press Association, which compiled the ranking, said punctuality across all UK airports in 2021 was better than before the Covid crisis, due to the reduction in flights caused by travel restrictions. Jo Rhodes, an expert for consumer magazine Which? Travel, said 2022 ""has been a different story entirely"" as the sector is struggling to cope with the spike in passenger numbers. She went on: ""Holidaymakers have endured wide-scale flight cancellations as well as unacceptably long queues at check-in, bag drop and airport security. She called for stronger powers for the Civil Aviation Authority, including the power to directly fine airlines for rule breaking. ""Ministers should also drop their ill-conceived plans to slash compensation rates for delayed or cancelled domestic flights,"" she said. Tim Alderslade, the chief executive of airline trade body Airlines UK, said: ""The whole aviation eco-system - both in the UK and internationally - is focussed on ensuring there is as much resilience as possible in the operation, so our passengers can get away this summer.

This included encouraging airlines to make sure their schedules are ""deliverable"", an amnesty on airport slot rules - to allow carriers to hand back their take-off and landing slots without financial penalty - and permitting new aviation workers to begin training before passing security checks.

Birmingham airport flights delayed longest in 2021,"Flights from Birmingham Airport had the longest delays in 2021, analysis of Civil Aviation Authority data suggests. Planes left 12 minutes and 24 seconds late from Birmingham on average in 2021, which was followed by Southampton, Heathrow, Exeter and Aberdeen. The ranking takes into account all scheduled and chartered departures, but cancelled flights are not included. Birmingham said many delayed departures were able to make up time in the air. This was because of a huge reduction in flight numbers due to the coronavirus pandemic. A spokesman said that last year was ""a dark time for aviation"", adding that Birmingham Airport was reduced to just a quarter of normal staffing and capacity due to Covid. But he said ""massive air traffic reductions"", meant that ""flights taking off late were able to catch up en route"". Birmingham serves long-haul destinations including Dubai, Mexico, the Caribbean and the US, as well as more than 100 short-haul routes, and is the UK's seventh busiest airport. It hosts bases for airlines such as Jet2.com, Ryanair and Tui Airways. Birmingham Airport chief executive gets 49% pay rise Flights will be more expensive, says IATA's Willie Walsh The BBC reported in June that the annual wage of the airport's chief executive Nick Barton rose by 49% from Â£399,000 to Â£595,000 last year, angering trade unions. The increase came after large-scale job cuts in the sector in the wake of the pandemic, but the airport - which is part-owned by several of the region's councils - said its senior managers were paid in line with market rates. The airport was used by 12.6 million passengers in 2019, before the pandemic, but just 2.5 million last year.

Why rush to cut taxes could turn ugly,"As the list of Tory party leadership candidates grows ever longer, there is one issue that has become the key battleground of this race - tax. So far, many have signalled they will cut taxes. But one wonders whether while drawing up their campaign pledges, the hopefuls had chance to look at a report by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the government's independent forecaster. Last week, it warned that the UK was facing a number of long-term borrowing challenges. In 50 years' time, says the OBR, the UK will be grappling with an ageing society and a shrinking workforce, while trying at the same time to reach net zero. The OBR's warnings might seem too far in the future for a population battling with soaring living costs right now. But a tax cut would also seem difficult to square with a 2019 Conservative manifesto pledge, which committed the party to balancing the current budget by the middle of the decade. That's balancing day-to-day spending with tax revenue and also getting debt falling as a share of the total economy or gross domestic product (GDP). So far, government policies, including a rise in National Insurance contributions, have raised the tax burden significantly, by 3% of GDP. That has funded public spending increases of 2% of GDP, which has left about Â£30bn of what is known as headroom. Most of the candidates seem to be using all of that up in one form or another. And then some. We await more detailed accounts of their plans. WatchBoris Johnson Quits: What Next & More Questionson iPlayer. But the really big point is that the Â£30bn doesn't exist any more. As OBR chairman Richard Hughes told me last week: ""We've got to remember the risks of the outlook for growing. ""You've got risks around energy prices, which are all already rising above the levels that we've seen in our last forecast. You've got risks to interest rates, which are also rising above levels we saw in the March forecasts"". Put most simply, there is a tangible risk of recession, or at least stagnation, arising from the rising cost of living. May's economic growth figures, which are due on Wednesday, are likely to show that the economy is on course to shrink in this quarter. Cabinet ministers vying for Number 10 are now openly embracing forecasts showing the UK has the worst outlook for growth next year among advanced economies. These were the same forecasts that were played down last year but are now being marshalled as an argument for a stimulus. So if the tax burden is to be reined in, perhaps these candidates will borrow more and yet again abandon the fiscal rules and 2019 manifesto promises. Or some of the promised post-pandemic increase in the size of the state - from social care funding to reducing NHS waiting lists, to ""levelling up"" funding - will have to be rolled back. As Mr Hughes put it to me about those advocating tax cuts now: ""It may also require them to revisit some of their spending priorities if they want to meet those fiscal objectives, which they've set for themselves in the manifesto"". There is obviously a wider political canvas here. This leadership contest is to impress at first Conservative MPs and then the party's membership. In theory that would suggest an appeal to low tax, small state thinking. But that is not always the same thing as the fiscal conservatism of balanced budgets. And how coherent all that is, with the appeal to former Labour areas won at the last election for example, is another interesting question. Then the bigger questions about even more significant changes, such as the effective loss of Â£30bn a year in petrol taxes, and funding an ageing society with a shrinking workforce, loom even larger from the pages of the OBR document.

They each have 12 minutes to speak Successful contenders will go through to a vote on Wednesday, with the final two candidates selected before the end of next week The winner will be announced on 5 September Edited by Chris Giles We'll be back tomorrow with the latest updates - please join us then. Today's page was written by Sam Hancock, Dulcie Lee, Emily McGarvey, Aoife Walsh, Thomas Mackintosh, Laura Gozzi, Jasmine Andersson, Jack Burgess and Marita Moloney. It was edited by Nathan Williams, Owen Amos, Lauren Turner, Claire Heald and Chris Giles.   We're pausing our live coverage of the Conservative leadership race soon. But before we go, here's a recap of today's main developments:  We understand the eight candidates who all want to be the next PM have finished speaking to their fellow Tory MPs at tonight's hustings. The leadership contenders were given 12 minutes to make their case ahead of the first round of votes tomorrow. Wednesday is set to be another busy day, with those vying to succeed Boris Johnson facing a vote after PMQs from 13:30 to 15:30 BST. Candidates must secure at least 30 votes each to make it to the next round, with a result expected by early evening. The leadership race will eventually be whittled down to two candidates by the end of next week, after which they will have the summer recess to win the support of the Tory membership before the final result on 5 September. Former Cabinet minister David Davis, who is backing Penny Mordaunt, has denied that leadership candidate Rishi Sunak is ""hated"" by many Tory MPs. Earlier, Davis told BBC Radio 4's PM programme: ""I don't think he's hated at all. ""We need a change of policy. ""If Rishi's going to stick with this policy, which has landed us with a recession and higher-than-average inflation for our economic peers, then I want to change that"". He called the former chancellor a ""perfectly charming, nice individual"". It's been a busy day with Tory MPs voicing their support for the party leadership contenders, with dozens publicly declaring their endorsements of who they'd like the next PM to be. But former Conservative Party leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith is remaining tight-lipped about who he'd like to see take charge. Speaking from the House of Commons where the eight candidates are speaking at hustings tonight, Duncan Smith told Sky News he's been ""impressed"" by all the contenders so far. ""This for once wasn't about Europe, it wasn't directly about taxation but was about how do you work to improve the quality of life for those who are the poorest in society,"" he says. ""It forced candidates to stop the to-and-fro bickering about who will cut taxes and not cut taxes and actually get down to talking about real lives."" Patrick Flynn, political analyst at the betting exchange SMarkets, has been running his figures on who might win this contest, and at what stage all the others will be beaten in the votes by MPs. According to his model, Suella Braverman, Jeremy Hunt, Kemi Badenoch and Nadim Zahawi will be eliminated in the first three ballots among MPs; Tom Tugendhat and Liz Truss will go after that; Rishi Sunak and Penny Mordaunt will make the final two. At that stage, all Conservative Party members are able to vote, with the result due on 5 September. Flynn explained his workings - he looks at how different demographics of MPs have endorsed candidates so far and how those who supported different runners in past contests are shaping up now. He also looks at MPs voting records on social and economic issues and where their constituencies lie on Brexit. While some commentators have predicted a quick falling away of candidates, Flynn suggests we could be in for up to five rounds of voting before two rivals emerge. We're getting some insight from the hustings where eight candidates contesting the Tory leadership race are setting out their stalls. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn is among the reporters gathered in the corridor outside the committee room in the House of Commons. She reports how bookmakers' favourite Rishi Sunak is also keen to get ahead at the hustings, arriving early for his speaking slot. The former chancellor is forced to head away from the committee room while leadership rival Tom Tugendhat takes to the podium. Jeremy Hunt's been talking to LBC Radio, before he headed off to the hustings, now ongoing in Parliament. He says it would be ""immoral"" to offer personal tax cuts as part of a leadership bid, funded from borrowing. He promotes corporate tax cuts. Hunt says he's costed his substantial tax cut pledges and admits ""they are expensive"" - but argues he could ""do this within the fiscal rule that says that debt has to fall as a proportion of GDP over the period"". He argues that while corporation tax cuts are ""not vote winners"", they would lead to economic growth by the time of the next election. Ione WellsPolitical Correspondent, BBC News The hustings are taking place as we speak in a House of Commons committee room. Cameras are not allowed in, so reporters are waiting in the corridor outside. Liz Truss has left after having her allotted 12 minutes to speak. Asked how it was, she says âvery hotâ. In terms of atmosphere or temperature? âEverything!â, comes the reply. Jeremy Hunt has now gone inâ¦ to slightly less banging on tables (the traditional way backbench Tories express their approval). A Tory organiser outside also described the room - saying âitâs absolutely swelteringâ. MP for Gosport Caroline Dinenage says she'll be throwing her weight behind Penny Mordaunt. She's backing her friend and old schoolmate Mordaunt, an arch Brexiteer, even though she herself voted to remain. ""The
fact is she brings people together from across the party, and all the different political views,"" she tells the BBC's Ros Atkins. ""She unites us."" Dinenage also says Mordaunt has made ""fully costed"" pledges, such as cutting the cost of fuel. ""She's not going wild on unfunded commitments,"" she adds.

They are Kemi Badenoch, Suella Braverman, Jeremy Hunt, Penny Mordaunt, Rishi Sunak, Liz Truss, Tom Tugendhat and Nadhim Zahawi. Each has the backing of at least 20 fellow MPs.

The eight candidates are just about to start speaking at the first hustings in Parliament. They're getting 12 minutes each to try to persuade Conservative MPs they should be the one to take over as party leader and prime minister. They're going to be speaking in this order: Liz Truss, Jeremy Hunt, Tom Tugendhat, Rishi Sunak, Suella Braverman, Kemi Badenoch, Nadhim Zahawim and then Penny Mordaunt. We are not expecting to be able to follow along with the hustings live - it's something just for Tory MPs - but will bring you any reaction as soon as we have it. Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent At the hustings - that begin at 19:00 BST in Parliament - roughly half of the audience will not be persuadable because they've already said who they're backing. Others like Priti Patel and Sajid Javid have said they are yet to make up their minds. But only part of their decision will be based on the performance this evening. Some already have in mind who they might be potentially backing but if someone was to come in with a better job offer dependent on their support, that might persuade them. It's not entirely going to be a merit-based process. Twelve minutes - you probably spend longer looking for a new car or new house than choosing a new prime minister. The hustings may be crucial for a few MPs choosing how to vote - but there will be other considerations, including personal ones, at play. Worth remembering too that we haven't had all of the candidates' campaign launches yet. Penny Mordaunt is due to hold hers tomorrow. Now that eight candidates have secured enough support, the 358 Tory MPs will hold a series of votes until only two candidates remain:  The first ballot will take place on Wednesday 13 July, from 13:30 to 15:30, with the result announced later tomorrow. The final two candidates should be known by the end of next week. After a series of hustings events around the country over the summer - when the remaining two candidates set out their plans - party members will pick the winner in a postal vote. Read more on this story here. We now know that there are eight people officially in the race to be the next Conservative party leader - and the next prime minister. Rishi Sunak, the former chancellor, is now the joint favourite with Penny Mordaunt, according to betting odds. They're followed by Liz Truss, Tom Tugendhat and Kemi Badenoch. We've a handyguide hereas to who joins them in the running. A bit more from Graham Brady. He says the first round ballot will take place on Wednesday, from 13:30 to 15:30. The result will be announced ""as soon as we can after that"", he says. The first hustings are happening in Parliament this evening, starting in just under an hour. The eight candidates will have 12 minutes each to speak, ahead of tomorrow's vote. Any candidate receiving fewer than 30 votes from the 358 Tory MPs will be eliminated in this first round. If all candidates reach that number, the one with the fewest votes is eliminated. Rounds of voting continue until only two candidates remain, then the vote goes out to Conservative Party members across the UK. The final result of that summer ballot, and the name of a new prime minister, comes on 5 September Now we hear from Sir Graham Brady, chairman of the 1922 Committee of backbench MPs. He says eight candidates have been nominated: Kemi Badenoch, Suella Braverman, Jeremy Hunt, Penny Mordaunt, Rishi Sunak, Liz Truss, Tom Tugendhat and Nadhim Zahawi.  Former Health Secretary Sajid Javid withdraws from the contest to be the next Conservative Party leader. He says: ""Serving in government is a true privilege. It has been just seven days since I took the difficult decision to resign from the most important job I have ever had, as health secretary during a pandemic."" ""Since then, I have set out the values and policies I think are right for the future of our great country."" ""I believe the party must now look outwards, not inwards, if we are to win again."" ""There is an abundance of both ideas and talent in our party. One of the candidates will be given the honour of becoming prime minister."" ""I look forward to seeing the debate unfold and to see colleagues working together as a united Conservative Party once the leadership election is concluded."" Â© 2025 BBC.

The eight candidates are just about to start speaking at the first hustings in Parliament. They're getting 12 minutes each to try to persuade Conservative MPs they should be the one to take over as party leader and prime minister. They're going to be speaking in this order: Liz Truss, Jeremy Hunt, Tom Tugendhat, Rishi Sunak, Suella Braverman, Kemi Badenoch, Nadhim Zahawim and then Penny Mordaunt. We are not expecting to be able to follow along with the hustings live - it's something just for Tory MPs - but will bring you any reaction as soon as we have it. Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent At the hustings - that begin at 19:00 BST in Parliament - roughly half of the audience will not be persuadable because they've already said who they're backing. Others like Priti Patel and Sajid Javid have said they are yet to make up their minds. But only part of their decision will be based on the performance this evening. Some already have in mind who they might be potentially backing but if someone was to come in with a better job offer dependent on their support, that might persuade them. It's not entirely going to be a merit-based process. Twelve minutes - you probably spend longer looking for a new car or new house than choosing a new prime minister. The hustings may be crucial for a few MPs choosing how to vote - but there will be other considerations, including personal ones, at play. Worth remembering too that we haven't had all of the candidates' campaign launches yet. Penny Mordaunt is due to hold hers tomorrow. Now that eight candidates have secured enough support, the 358 Tory MPs will hold a series of votes until only two candidates remain:  The first ballot will take place on Wednesday 13 July, from 13:30 to 15:30, with the result announced later tomorrow. The final two candidates should be known by the end of next week. After a series of hustings events around the country over the summer - when the remaining two candidates set out their plans - party members will pick the winner in a postal vote. Read more on this story here. We now know that there are eight people officially in the race to be the next Conservative party leader - and the next prime minister. Rishi Sunak, the former chancellor, is now the joint favourite with Penny Mordaunt, according to betting odds. They're followed by Liz Truss, Tom Tugendhat and Kemi Badenoch. We've a handyguide hereas to who joins them in the running. A bit more from Graham Brady. He says the first round ballot will take place on Wednesday, from 13:30 to 15:30. The result will be announced ""as soon as we can after that"", he says. The first hustings are happening in Parliament this evening, starting in just under an hour. The eight candidates will have 12 minutes each to speak, ahead of tomorrow's vote. Any candidate receiving fewer than 30 votes from the 358 Tory MPs will be eliminated in this first round. If all candidates reach that number, the one with the fewest votes is eliminated. Rounds of voting continue until only two candidates remain, then the vote goes out to Conservative Party members across the UK. The final result of that summer ballot, and the name of a new prime minister, comes on 5 September Now we hear from Sir Graham Brady, chairman of the 1922 Committee of backbench MPs. He says eight candidates have been nominated: Kemi Badenoch, Suella Braverman, Jeremy Hunt, Penny Mordaunt, Rishi Sunak, Liz Truss, Tom Tugendhat and Nadhim Zahawi.

They each have 12 minutes to speak Successful contenders will go through to a vote on Wednesday, with the final two candidates selected before the end of next week The winner will be announced on 5 September Edited by Chris Giles We'll be back tomorrow with the latest updates - please join us then. Today's page was written by Sam Hancock, Dulcie Lee, Emily McGarvey, Aoife Walsh, Thomas Mackintosh, Laura Gozzi, Jasmine Andersson, Jack Burgess and Marita Moloney. It was edited by Nathan Williams, Owen Amos, Lauren Turner, Claire Heald and Chris Giles.   We're pausing our live coverage of the Conservative leadership race soon. But before we go, here's a recap of today's main developments:  We understand the eight candidates who all want to be the next PM have finished speaking to their fellow Tory MPs at tonight's hustings. The leadership contenders were given 12 minutes to make their case ahead of the first round of votes tomorrow. Wednesday is set to be another busy day, with those vying to succeed Boris Johnson facing a vote after PMQs from 13:30 to 15:30 BST. Candidates must secure at least 30 votes each to make it to the next round, with a result expected by early evening. The leadership race will eventually be whittled down to two candidates by the end of next week, after which they will have the summer recess to win the support of the Tory membership before the final result on 5 September. Former Cabinet minister David Davis, who is backing Penny Mordaunt, has denied that leadership candidate Rishi Sunak is ""hated"" by many Tory MPs. Earlier, Davis told BBC Radio 4's PM programme: ""I don't think he's hated at all. ""We need a change of policy. ""If Rishi's going to stick with this policy, which has landed us with a recession and higher-than-average inflation for our economic peers, then I want to change that"". He called the former chancellor a ""perfectly charming, nice individual"". It's been a busy day with Tory MPs voicing their support for the party leadership contenders, with dozens publicly declaring their endorsements of who they'd like the next PM to be. But former Conservative Party leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith is remaining tight-lipped about who he'd like to see take charge. Speaking from the House of Commons where the eight candidates are speaking at hustings tonight, Duncan Smith told Sky News he's been ""impressed"" by all the contenders so far. ""This for once wasn't about Europe, it wasn't directly about taxation but was about how do you work to improve the quality of life for those who are the poorest in society,"" he says. ""It forced candidates to stop the to-and-fro bickering about who will cut taxes and not cut taxes and actually get down to talking about real lives."" Patrick Flynn, political analyst at the betting exchange SMarkets, has been running his figures on who might win this contest, and at what stage all the others will be beaten in the votes by MPs. According to his model, Suella Braverman, Jeremy Hunt, Kemi Badenoch and Nadim Zahawi will be eliminated in the first three ballots among MPs; Tom Tugendhat and Liz Truss will go after that; Rishi Sunak and Penny Mordaunt will make the final two. At that stage, all Conservative Party members are able to vote, with the result due on 5 September. Flynn explained his workings - he looks at how different demographics of MPs have endorsed candidates so far and how those who supported different runners in past contests are shaping up now. He also looks at MPs voting records on social and economic issues and where their constituencies lie on Brexit. While some commentators have predicted a quick falling away of candidates, Flynn suggests we could be in for up to five rounds of voting before two rivals emerge. We're getting some insight from the hustings where eight candidates contesting the Tory leadership race are setting out their stalls. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn is among the reporters gathered in the corridor outside the committee room in the House of Commons. She reports how bookmakers' favourite Rishi Sunak is also keen to get ahead at the hustings, arriving early for his speaking slot. The former chancellor is forced to head away from the committee room while leadership rival Tom Tugendhat takes to the podium. Jeremy Hunt's been talking to LBC Radio, before he headed off to the hustings, now ongoing in Parliament. He says it would be ""immoral"" to offer personal tax cuts as part of a leadership bid, funded from borrowing. He promotes corporate tax cuts. Hunt says he's costed his substantial tax cut pledges and admits ""they are expensive"" - but argues he could ""do this within the fiscal rule that says that debt has to fall as a proportion of GDP over the period"". He argues that while corporation tax cuts are ""not vote winners"", they would lead to economic growth by the time of the next election. Ione WellsPolitical Correspondent, BBC News The hustings are taking place as we speak in a House of Commons committee room. Cameras are not allowed in, so reporters are waiting in the corridor outside. Liz Truss has left after having her allotted 12 minutes to speak. Asked how it was, she says âvery hotâ. In terms of atmosphere or temperature? âEverything!â, comes the reply. Jeremy Hunt has now gone inâ¦ to slightly less banging on tables (the traditional way backbench Tories express their approval). A Tory organiser outside also described the room - saying âitâs absolutely swelteringâ. MP for Gosport Caroline Dinenage says she'll be throwing her weight behind Penny Mordaunt. She's backing her friend and old schoolmate Mordaunt, an arch Brexiteer, even though she herself voted to remain. ""The
fact is she brings people together from across the party, and all the different political views,"" she tells the BBC's Ros Atkins. ""She unites us."" Dinenage also says Mordaunt has made ""fully costed"" pledges, such as cutting the cost of fuel. ""She's not going wild on unfunded commitments,"" she adds. This video can not be played Sir Graham Brady announces top eight Tory leadership candidates Sir Graham Brady, chairman of the Conservative Party's 1922 Committee, which organises leadership contests, announces the names of the eight Conservative leadership contenders. They are Kemi Badenoch, Suella Braverman, Jeremy Hunt, Penny Mordaunt, Rishi Sunak, Liz Truss, Tom Tugendhat and Nadhim Zahawi. Each has the backing of at least 20 fellow MPs. Former Health Secretary Sajid Javid and Rehman Chishti MP withdrew from the contest just minutes before the deadline. The first ballot and its result happen on Wednesday.

Leak reveals top politicians secretly helped UberEmmanuel Macron is among leaders who helped the ride-hailing company disrupt new markets.,"The files show Emmanuel Macron was on first name terms with Uber's founder while ex-EU commissioner Neelie Kroes secretly lobbied for the firm Thousands of leaked files have exposed how Uber courted top politicians, and how far it went to avoid justice. They detail the extensive help Uber got from leaders such as Emmanuel Macron and ex-EU commissioner Neelie Kroes. They also show how the taxi firm's former boss personally ordered the use of a ""kill switch"" to prevent raiding police from accessing computers. Uber says its ""past behaviour wasn't in line with present values"" and it is a ""different company"" today. The Uber Files are a trove of more than 124,000 records, including 83,000 emails and 1,000 other files involving conversations, spanning 2013 to 2017. They were leaked tothe Guardian,external, and shared with theInternational Consortium of Investigative Journalists,externaland a number of media organisations including BBC Panorama. They reveal, for the first time, how a $90m-a-year lobbying and public relations effort recruited friendly politicians to help in its campaign to disrupt Europe's taxi industry. While French taxi drivers staged sometimes violent protests in the streets against Uber, Mr Macron - now president - was on first name terms with Uber's controversial boss Travis Kalanick, and told him he would reform laws in the firm's favour. Uber's ruthless business methods were widely known, but for the first time the files give a unique inside view of the lengths it went to in achieving its goals. UBER FILES:Tech firm lobbied top ministers at undeclared meetings UBER FILES:Greyballing, kill switches, lobbying - Uber's dark tricks revealed They show how ex-EU digital commissioner Neelie Kroes, one of Brussels' top officials, was in talks to join Uber before her term ended - and then secretly lobbied for the firm, in potential breach of EU ethics rules. At the time, Uber was not just one of the world's fastest-growing companies - it was one of the most controversial, dogged by court cases, allegations of sexual harassment, and data breach scandals. Eventually shareholders had enough, andTravis Kalanick was forced out in 2017. Uber says his replacement, Dara Khosrowshahi, was ""tasked with transforming every aspect of how Uber operates"" and has ""installed the rigorous controls and compliance necessary to operate as a public company"". Paris was the scene of Uber's first European launch, and it met stiff resistance from the taxi industry, culminating in violent protests in the streets. In August 2014, an ambitious former banker named Emmanuel Macron had just been appointed minister for the economy. He saw Uber as a source of growth and badly needed new jobs, and was keen to help. That October, he held a meeting with Mr Kalanick and other executives and lobbyists, which marked the start of a long - but little-publicised - stint as a champion of the controversial firm's interests within government. Uber lobbyist Mark MacGann described the meeting as ""spectacular. Like I've never seen,"" the files show. ""We will dance soon,"" he added. ""Emmanuel"" and ""Travis"" were soon on first name terms, and met at least four times, the files show - in Paris, and at the World Economic Forum conference in Davos, Switzerland. Only the Davos meeting has been previously reported. At one point Uber wrote to Mr Macron saying it was ""extremely grateful"". ""The openness and welcome we receive is unusual in government-industry relations."" French taxi drivers were particularly enraged by the 2014 launch of UberPop - a service that allowed unlicensed drivers to offer rides, at much lower prices. Courts and parliament banned it, but Uber kept the service running as it challenged the law. Mr Macron didn't think there was a future for UberPop, but he agreed to work with the company to rewrite France's laws governing its other services. ""Uber will provide an outline for a regulatory framework for ridesharing. We will connect our respective teams to start working on a feasible proposal that could become the formal framework in France,"" an email from Travis Kalanick to Mr Macron reads. On 25 June 2015, the protests became violent, and a week later Mr Macron texted Mr Kalanick with an apparent offer of help. Protests against UberPop turned violent. Paris, 25 June 2015 ""[I] will gather everybody next week to prepare the reform and correct the law."" The same day, Uber announced the suspension of UberPop in France. The extent of the now-president of France's relationship with the controversial global firm that was operating in violation of French law has not been revealed until now. A spokesperson for Mr Macron said in an email: ""His functions naturally led him to meet and interact with many companies engaged in the sharp shift which came out during those years in the service sector, which had to be facilitated by unlocking administrative and regulatory hurdles."" Uber said the ""suspension of UberPop was in no way followed by more favourable regulations,"" and a new law that came into force in 2018 resulted in France adopting ""stricter regulations"" that were ""in no way beneficial to Uber"". The files also reveal how Uber's relationship with one of Europe's top officials, European Commission vice-president Neelie Kroes, began significantly earlier and ran deeper than previously was known, putting her in an apparent breach of rules governing commissioners' conduct. They reveal she was in talks to join Uber's advisory board before she even left her last European post in November 2014. EU rules say commissioners have to respect a ""cooling-off"" period, then 18 months, during which new jobs require the approval of the commission. As a commissioner, Ms Kroes oversaw digital and competition policy, and was a high-profile scourge of big tech, playing a leading role in hitting Microsoft andIntel with massive fines,external. But of all the companies she could have worked for after leaving, Uber was a particularly controversial choice. In her home country, the Netherlands, the UberPop ridesharing service had also brought legal and political trouble. Uber drivers were arrested in October 2014, and that December a judge in the Hague banned UberPop, threatening fines up to 100,000 euros. In March 2015, Uber's Amsterdam office was raided by Dutch police. Emails say that Ms Kroes called ministers and other members of the government to persuade them to back down during the raid.During another raid a week later, Ms Kroes again contacted a Dutch minister the Uber Files show, and, in the words of an email, ""harassed"" the head of the Dutch civil service. An internal email advised staff not to discuss her informal relationship externally: ""Her reputation and our ability to negotiate solutions in the Netherlands and elsewhere would suffer from any casual banter inside or outside the office."" The files show that the company wanted Ms Kroes to pass messages on to the office of the Dutch Prime Minister, Mark Rutte. In October 2015, an email reads: ""We'll get backchannel going with Neelie and the PM's Chief of Staff, to extract maximum advantage through 'giving' them the notion of a 'victory'."" She wrote to the commission's Ad Hoc Ethical Committee requesting permission to join Uber's advisory board before the 18 months were up, and appealed to commission president Jean-Claude Juncker. That permission was denied, but documents show Ms Kroes continued to help the company informally until her appointment was announced, shortly after the cooling-off period had ended. This underlines that Ms Kroes was in a ""clear breach"" of the rules, says Alberto Alemanno, Jean Monnet professor of European Union law at HEC Paris. Dutch PM Mark Rutte, Uber's then CEO Travis Kalanick and Neelie Kroes on a visit to Silicon Valley in 2016 ""You're proving the fact that you're doing something you are not allowed to do,"" he told BBC Panorama. ""Because if she didn't necessarily ask for permission, you might still argue there was a grey area, there was a grey zone. But now it's no longer there."" Looking at all the disclosures about Ms Kroes' relationship with Uber, he said: ""It makes me feel that our system is probably not fit for purpose because this situation should have been prevented."" Ms Kroes denies that she had any ""formal or informal role at Uber"" before May 2016, when the cooling-off period expired. She said as an EU commissioner she interacted with numerous technology companies, ""always driven by what I believe would benefit the public interest"". During the cooling off period, the Dutch government appointed her special envoy for start-ups, which involved interactions with a ""wide array of business, government and non-governmental entities"" with the aim of promoting a ""business-friendly and welcoming ecosystem in the Netherlands"", she said. A spokesperson for the Dutch ministry of economic affairs says that ""Uber was not considered a start-up in 2015"". Uber says Ms Kroes left the advisory board in 2018, and says it has since introduced new guidelines ""strengthening oversight"" of ""lobbying and external engagements with policymakers"" in Europe. If the police came knocking, Uber had a second line of defence - the ""kill switch"", which made it impossible for visiting law enforcement to access the company's computers. This would restrict officers' access to sensitive company data, such as lists of drivers, which the company believed would harm its growth. The files confirm earlier news reports about the kill switch, and reveal that Mr Kalanick himself activated the system at least once. ""Please hit the kill switch ASAP. Access must be shut down in AMS [Amsterdam],"" an email from his account says. The kill switch was also used in Canada, Belgium, India, Romania and Hungary, and at least three times in France. Uber says it has had no ""'kill switch' designed to thwart regulatory inquiries anywhere in the world"" since the new chief executive took over in 2017. A spokesperson for Mr Kalanick said he never authorised any actions or programmes that would obstruct justice in any country, and any accusation he did is completely false. He said Uber ""used tools that protect intellectual property and the privacy of their customers"" and that ""these fail-safe protocols do not delete any data or information, and were approved by Uber's legal and regulatory departments"". The Uber Files is a leak of 124,000 records including emails and texts exposing conversations and meetings between Uber executives and public officials as the technology-driven taxi firm sought to expand its business. The files were leaked tothe Guardian,externalwhich shared them with theInternational Consortium of Investigative Journalists,externalin Washington DC and media partners in 29 countries, including the BBC's Panorama.
