Court order sought to end DUP meetings boycott,"The North-South Ministerial Council (NSMC) was cancelled earlier after Edwin Poots failed to turn up A Belfast businessman is to seek a court order aimed at forcing the Democratic Unionist Party to end its boycott of of most cross-border ministerial meetings. On Monday, the High Court ruledthe DUP's boycott was ""unlawful"". But on Friday two ministerial meetings were cancelled after the DUP's Edwin Poots failed to show. Businessman Sean Napier said he was seeking the court order as a ""guardian of the Good Friday Agreement"". Mr Napier, who mounted the High Court challenge earlier this week, said the agreement was not an ""a la carte"" treaty. ""It has been there for us, it has kept peace here and it's imperative it is properly implemented in all its parts,"" he said. Mr Napier said the Good Friday Agreement was not an ""a la carte"" treaty Mr Napier added: ""It is very important in what it has done for the greater good of the people here. I think it is my duty to be its guardian."" DUP First Minister Paul Givan said no meetings were planned for Friday as he had not agreed the agendas. Northern Ireland's Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon and the Republic of Ireland's environment minister logged on, but her DUP ministerial colleague Edwin Poots did not. He was also a no show in a meeting with Junior Minister Declan Kearney and Irish Minister Darragh O'Brien. Mr Napier's solicitor Paul Farrell said the DUP must explain their position the ministerial meetings. ""I don't understand that a meeting that takes place today with accompanying ministers is not a meeting,"" he said. ""I think whatever we receive next week by way of response from DUP ministers will have to explain that. I cannot understand when a meeting is not a meeting."" Givan defends DUP boycott of north-south meetings DUP boycott of north-south meetings 'unlawful' The DUP boycott of most North-South Ministerial Council (NSMC) meetings wasannounced by party leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldsonlast month. The NSMC is the main body for cross-border co-operation between the governments of Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. It is attended by ministers from both sides of the border who oversee joint working in areas such as trade, food safety and agriculture. The DUP is refusing to attend in protest againstthe Northern Ireland Protocol. The protocol is part of the Brexit deal agreed in 2019 and was introduced to help prevent checks along the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. But unionists say it creates a barrier to trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and undermines the latter's position in the UK. Ms Mallon says the boycott must end The NI minister Ms Mallon said the boycott must end. She had been due to discuss cross-border aquaculture with her counterparts. ""It is astounding following this week's High Court ruling that Jeffrey Donaldson is overseeing a deliberate and unlawful boycott of the north-south institutions,"" she said. ""It shows only disdain for the rule of law but utter contempt for the people we represent."" On Thursday, ministers attended a NSMC meeting on health issues. TheDUP said this was in line with its position. Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, DUP leader, says the party's position ""remains as it has been"" When asked on Thursday whether the DUP would continue its boycott, Sir Jeffrey told BBC Radio Foyle ""our position remains as it has been"". Sinn FÃ©in junior minister Declan Kearney said that ""this inaction by Minister Edwin Poots and the executive office is a serious failure to comply with the law and the ministerial code which require ministers to participate in meetings of the NSMC"". He added: ""These institutions are about joining up services across the island and delivering on important issues which impact on people's lives such as health, education and millions of pounds in funding.Â ""It's time the DUP put ordinary people's interests first by ending this illegal boycott of vital government business and get back to work on behalf of everyone in our society.""

Extra Â£5.5m in GP funding for 'challenging winter',"The Department of Health is making up to Â£5.5m available to support GP services in Northern Ireland over winter. Health Minister Robin Swann said he recognised the importance of people being able to access GP services. The funding will be used to improve technology and accessibility, and support patient care. Mr Swann said that services across health and social care were facing ""a challenging winter"". He has allocated Â£3.8m to support additional patient care during this time and up to Â£1.7m to further improve telephone and computer technology. He added that GP feedback showed that patients were presenting with more complex needs, making it difficult for GPs ""to see all the people they would wish to"". Department of Health figures show that GP practices are currently carrying out almost 200,000 consultations on a weekly basis. GP's 'distress' as patients complain about access Fall in GP surgery numbers in NI, report finds The health minister said that GP practices have been open throughout the pandemic and will continue to use both face-to-face appointments and alternative consultation options for patients. He said work was taking place to improve access to primary care for patients, including exploring how telephone systems could be better used to support services. He added that consideration was also being given to ways to better deal with routine requests, such as repeat prescriptions to release capacity. Robin Swann says that primary care services in NI were ""under increasing pressure"" before the pandemic ""This work is part of a wider programme to help improve patient access to services, which includes the wider rollout of primary care multi-disciplinary teams, and work to reform the out-of-hours service. ""I am committed to ensuring that we have a GP workforce that is supported, motivated and sustainable and that continues to provide quality care to patients when they need it."" He said work was taking place on a review of GP trainee places, to make sure there were ""enough GPs to meet our primary care needs into the future"". Londonderry GP Dr Nicola Duffy said she had asked the Department of Health to be allowed to see more patients in person. She said they were currently restricted by policy. She told BBC Radio Ulster 's Talkback programme that she was not allowed to see patients ""without social distancing, wearing a mask, regardless of whether I am vaccinated or not"". ""That is to protect the vulnerable patients that are using the health centre that I work in,"" she said. ""I am ready, my colleagues are ready. Could someone higher than me fix this, so we can get back to seeing our patients?"" Dr Alan Stout, chair of the British Medical Association of Northern Ireland, said he hoped the funding would help some of the immediate pressures that GPs were facing, ""as well as beginning to address some of the more systemic and complex issues, including the number of GP trainee places available"". Dr Alan Stout from the BMA said general practice has ""never closed"" ""General practice has not closed and never closed,"" he said. ""Consultation rates and the number of patients contacting their surgery continue to be high and the current system is struggling to cope. ""All of our staff are feeling the pressure and we recognise that the difficulty in access and delays in seeing your GP cause frustration to patients."" But will the extra money help to resolve the current difficulties many patients are facing when trying to get a face-to-face GP appointment? Dr Laurence Dorman, chair of the Royal College of General Practitioners Northern Ireland (RCGPNI), said the Â£5.5m was ""very welcome"" and would mean ""extra surgeries and extra colleagues"" to help meet patients' needs. However, he said it was ""short-term"" funding and what was really needed is longer-term financial support and more GPs to join the workforce. ""At the moment, there's no point putting an extra phone line into our surgery if we don't have a GP at the end of those lines to meet the needs of our patients,"" he explained. Dr Dorman also warned that Covid-19 continues to pose safety concerns in GP waiting rooms, particularly for vulnerable patients who need to attend surgeries for treatment. ""We're still in the middle of a pandemic and we have to work the way we do to meet infection control standards,"" he told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme. ""We simply not like hairdressers and shops - we have sick patients coming into our buildings.  We have patients who are taking blood tests, chemotherapy and we must be able to protect them,"" he said. ""We are seeing out patients face-to-face when it's appropriate and safe to do so, but we are still in a pandemic, we need our patients to work with us."" ""But if our patients need seen face-to-face, absolutely then their family doctor will do that."" Dr Laurence Dorman said GP were still seeing patients face-to-face when it was ""appropriate and safe to do so"" As well as his RCGPNI role, Dr Dorman works in a GP surgery in Kilkeel, County Down. Addressing complaints over the number of in person appointments being made available, he argued that GPs were working ""harder than ever"". Dr Dorman said the GP workforce was ""tired and exhausted"", adding that ""some of the negative criticism is really demoralising"". He argued that the increase in telephone consultations during the pandemic meant that family doctors were treating more patients than they had ever done before and were often able to provide a ""same-day"" service. He said GP services were undergoing an ""overall transformation"" like many parts of the health service, in an attempt to tailor services to patients' needs. ""This new way of working is actually suiting and working very well for some patients,"" he added. Dr Dorman said that pre-Covid, most patients frequently faced a two-week wait for a GP appointment, most of which were face-to-face. ""That didn't suit a lot of patients, particularly patients who worked, patients who had caring commitments, so these new ways of working which are going right across the health care system, right through to outpatients and so on, are important and necessary.""

Virgin Galactic's space tourism debut delayed,"Virgin Galactic's VSS Unity spacecraft Shares in Virgin Galactic dived as much as 20% on Friday after the space tourism company said it was postponing its first commercial flight. The trip was scheduled for the third quarter of 2022, but will be delayed until the fourth as the firm conducts repairs and upgrades. It also said it will not conduct a second planned test flight this year. Virgin is in a race with Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin and Elon Musk's Space X to start flying tourists into space. In a statement,externalthe firm said a planned upgrade programme, aimed at enhancing the durability of its ships, would begin a month later than planned. It comes after routine tests revealed ""a possible reduction in the strength margins of certain materials"" used on its VMS Eve and VSS Unity craft. Earth should come before space, William says Virgin Galactic cleared to resume space flights Virgin said this required further inspection but played down safety concerns. ""While this new lab test data has had no impact on the vehicles, our test flight protocols have clearly defined strength margins, and further analysis will assess whether any additional work is required to keep them at or above established levels,"" said company boss Michael Colglazier. The company, founded by British billionaire Richard Branson, said its next test flight - Unity 23 - would now happen next summer. Commercial flights will start after that. Last month, the US Federal Aviation Administration lifted a no-fly order on Virgin Galactic after a flight in July deviated from assigned airspace on its descent. The regulator had accused the company of not providing the necessary information about the flight in which Mr Branson participated. On Wednesday, Hollywood actorWilliam Shatner became the oldest person to go to spaceas he blasted off aboard the Blue Origin sub-orbital capsule developed by billionaire Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. Meanwhile, four amateur astronauts blasted off from Florida on their private mission on one of Space X's Dragon spacecraft in September.

Apple takes down Quran app in China,"Apple has taken down one of the world's most popular Quran apps in China, following a request from officials. Quran Majeed is available across the world on the App Store - and has nearly 150,000 reviews. It is used by millions of Muslims. The BBC understands that the app was removed for hosting illegal religious texts. The Chinese government has not responded to the BBC's request for comment. The deletion of the app was first noticed by Apple Censorship - a website that monitors apps on Apple's App Store globally. In a statement from the app's maker, PDMS, the company said: ""According to Apple, our app Quran Majeed has been removed from the China App store because it includes content that requires additional documentation from Chinese authorities"". ""We are trying to get in touch with the Cyberspace Administration of China and relevant Chinese authorities to get this issue resolved"". The company said it had close to one million users in China. The Chinese Communist Party officially recognises Islam as a religion in the country. However, China has been accused of human rights violations, and even genocide, against the mostly Muslim Uyghur ethnic group in Xinjiang. Earlier this year theBBC reported that Uyghur imams had been targetedin China's Xinjiang crackdown. Apple declined to comment,but directed the BBC to its Human Rights Policy,,externalwhich states: ""We're required to comply with local laws, and at times there are complex issues about which we may disagree with governments."" Screengrab from Quran Majeed promotional material However, it is not clear what rules the app has broken in China. Quran Majeed says it is ""trusted by over 35 million Muslims globally"". Last month, both Apple and Google removed a tactical voting app devised by jailed Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny. Russian authorities had threatened to fine the two companies if they refused to drop the app, which told users who could unseat ruling party candidates. China is one of Apple's biggest markets, and the company's supply chain is heavily reliant on Chinese manufacturing. Apple chief executive Tim Cook has been accused of hypocrisy from politicians in the US for speaking out about American politics, but staying quiet about China. Mr Cook criticised Donald Trump's ban of seven Muslim-majority countries in 2017. However, he is also accused of complying with the Chinese government over censorship - and not publicly criticising it for its treatment of Muslim minorities. The New York Times reported earlier this year,externalthat Apple takes down apps in China if deemed off limits by the Chinese government. Topics that apps cannot discuss include Tiananmen Square, the Chinese spiritual movement Falun Gong, the Dalai Lama, and independence for Tibet and Taiwan. Benjamin Ismail, project director at Apple Censorship, said: ""Currently Apple is being turned into the censorship bureau of Beijing. ""They need to do the right thing, and then face whatever the reaction is of the Chinese government."" Another popular religious app, Olive Tree's Bible app, was also taken down this week in China. The company told the BBC they had removed the app themselves. ""Olive Tree Bible Software was informed during the App Store review process that we are required to provide a permit demonstrating our authorization to distribute an app with book or magazine content in mainland China,"" said a spokesperson. ""Since we did not have the permit and needed to get our app update approved and out to customers, we removed our Bible app from China's App Store."" On Friday, The Mac Observer reported that Audible, the Amazon owned audiobook and podcast service, removed its app from the Apple store in mainland China last month ""due to permit requirements."" On Thursday, Microsoft said it was shutting down its social network, LinkedIn, in China, saying having to comply with the Chinese state had become increasingly challenging. The decision was made after the career-networking site faced questions for blocking the profiles of some journalists.

Adele's comeback single: Hit or miss?,"This video can not be played Easy On Me is the first new music released by Adele in six years After a slow-burning PR campaign, Adele's first new music in six years has arrived. Easy On Me, a spare and emotional piano ballad, was released at midnight UK time, offering fans the first glimpse of her ""divorce album"", entitled 30. That will be her follow-up to massively successful albums 19, 21 and 25. Easy On Me sees Adele explaining her decision to walk away from her marriage in 2019, while asking her son and ex-husband for understanding. ""I changed who I was to put you both first,"" she sings, ""but now I give up"". That moment, so naked and unvarnished, sends shivers down your spine. Adele's voice is full of regret, but also resolve. 'Thank you, Adele - I got divorced young too' In the accompanying music video, director Xavier Dolan chooses this moment to transition from black and white to full colour - making clear that this is the sound of a woman who has dismantled her entire world, realising that she needn't feel guilty for putting herself first.

Adele addresses the chorus, ""go easy on me"", to herself as much as her family - and she accepts it's too soon for them to see her point of view. ""I had good intentions / And the highest hopes / But I know, right now / It probably doesn't even show."" The song was apparently the first track written for Adele's forthcoming album, and dates back to the year of her separation. The immediacy of those emotions is apparent in her vocal, simultaneously strong and vulnerable. But there's also a generosity to the song. Adele is reaching out to the people she's hurt, but Easy On Me is also a big woolly blanket wrapped around the loneliness and pain of anyone who's been through a core-shaking break-up. Adele says new album will explain divorce to son Adele finalises divorce with joint custody of son Adele sings and jokes about weight as she hosts SNL It's already proved to be a hit. Just under 300,000 people tuned in to watch the video premiere on YouTube. Within 12 hours it had been streamed 12 million times. The single comes just five weeks before her new album  - which was first teased in a global marketing campaign that saw the number 30 projected on to buildings and billboards in Brazil, Mexico, Dubai, Italy, Germany, Ireland, the US and the UK. Fans correctly guessed the release date of 19 November when Taylor Swift moved her forthcoming album forward by a week, apparently to avoid a clash with Adele. Easy On Me was co-written with Adele's frequent collaborator Greg Kurstin Like her previous three albums the title is a reference to a specific age in Adele's life. Thirty is the age at which she married her long-term partner, Simon Konecki, and then left him. The star has said the album was recorded to help her eight-year-old son understand their divorce the following year. ""I wanted to explain to him through this record, when he's in his 20s or 30s, who I am and why I voluntarily chose to dismantle his entire life in the pursuit of my own happiness,""she told Vogue magazine.,external ""It made him really unhappy sometimes. And that's a real wound for me that I don't know if I'll ever be able to heal,"" she added. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Speaking to BBC Radio 2's Zoe Ball, the singer said the album ""was bloody hard work to make"". ""I was singing things I didn't even realise I was feeling or thinking,"" she said, adding that it was important for her to share those emotions with the world. ""I feel like I can't unlock a door for my own mental health and take the key with me. I've got to leave it in the door for everyone else - and I'm in a strong place now where I feel like I can put that vulnerability out. Allow Twitter content?

In a separate interview with BBC Radio 1's Greg James, she admitted that her friends hadn't been too impressed by Easy On Me when she played them the demo. ""I sent a snippet of it, as I was writing it, to three of my closest friends,"" she said. ""One didn't like it, one was like, 'keep trying', and the other was like, 'I'm busy working'. So that was the perfect response."" BBC Sounds: Adele on Radio 1 Once it was finished, however, ""they loved it"". ""And I don't do any music in my time off. It's not a muscle that I exercise - writing or singing,"" she added. ""So most of the time, even just for my best friends and my manager, their first reaction, no matter what the song is, is, 'it's just nice to hear you sing'."" While Easy On Me is very much a traditional Adele ballad, there have been hints that the rest of the album will showcase a more experimental side to Adele's music. According to Vogue, one track features her vocals ""sampled and resampled over a hypnotic beat"", that is reminiscent of electro-pop act Goldfrapp. She has also worked with London-based producer Inflo - responsible for the retro R&B sounds of Michael Kiwanuka and Little Simz - as well as the Oscar-winning composer of the Black Panther score, Ludwig GÃ¶ransson. Radio 2 DJ Jo Whiley, who has been played a handful of the songs, said there are ""all kinds"" of sounds and genres on the album. ""There's one that I listened to and it just made me feel incredibly sad,"" she added. ""She really does pour her heart out and her voice, I think, has never sounded better. ""I was really surprised by the heights that she reaches - and the power and the resonance within her voice is amazing."" The music world meanwhile has been reacting to Adele's long-awaited return, with Canadian star Drake alerting his Instagram followers to the fact that ""one of my best friends in the world just dropped a single"". Solo star and former Fifth Harmony memberNormani declared,external: ""Adele oh Adele I love uuuuuuuu."" Elsewhere, Clueless film star Alicia Silverstone posted a humorous video on TikTok of her preparing to drown her sorrows while listening the London singer's latest heartfelt offering.

However it sounds, 30 is certain to be a shot in the arm for the UK music industry. Only one British album released since the start of 2020, Dua Lipa's Future Nostalgia, has sold the 300,000 copies required to be awarded a platinum disc. It took her 10 months to achieve that feat. By contrast, Adele's last album, 25, went platinum in its first 24 hours. It went on to become the UK's 14th best-selling album of all time, with sales in excess of 3.6 million. Sony, her new record label, will be hoping to match those sorts of sales heights - although the CD market has declined precipitously since 2015; and Adele's streaming numbers don't yet match those of her peers. She currently has 22 million monthly listeners on Spotify, compared to Ed Sheeran's 75 million and Taylor Swift's 46.5 million. New music will undoubtedly boost those figures, however, even if Adele faces stiff competition from Sheeran, Swift, Abba and Coldplay, who will all release new material in the coming weeks. Martin Talbot, chief executive of the Official Charts Company, described the pile-up as an ""embarrassment of riches"" that is almost unprecedented for the music retail sector - but he predicted Adele would emerge on top. ""It would be a brave man who predicted anything other than 30 being the biggest album of this Christmas,"" he told the BBC. ""And, with certifications now also reflecting streams, as well as traditional physical and download sales, it is in with a strong chance of going platinum in its first week.""

US to lift travel ban on 8 November,"The US has said that it will reopen its borders to fully vaccinated travellers from 33 countries on 8 November. Under new rules announced by the White House, vaccinated people who have had a negative test in the 72 hours before travelling will be allowed to enter. The move marks the end of the tough restrictions that have been imposed on travellers since early last year. ""This policy is guided by public health, stringent and consistent,"" a White House spokesman said. The new rules will apply to Schengen countries - a group of 26 European nations - as well as the UK, Brazil, China, India, Iran, Ireland, and South Africa. The current rules bar entry to most non-US citizens who have been in the UK, China, India, South Africa, Iran, Brazil or a number of European countries within the last 14 days. However, the policy has caused controversy, as passengers from 150 other countries, many of whom have struggled with high rates of Covid infection, have continued to enter the US freely. Officials announced that people who have been jabbed with one of the vaccines that are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or have been granted an Emergency Use Listing from the World Health Organization (WHO) will qualify under the system. The Emergency Use aspect will allow travellers who have received the AstraZeneca jab, widely used in the UK, as well as China's Sinovac and Sinopharm vaccines, to enter the country. It was also confirmed that travellers will not be required to go into quarantine upon entering the country. The announcement was swiftly celebrated by would-be travellers across the globe. Among them was Kent resident Dan Johnson, who told the BBC he had been unable to visit his father in the US before he died of cancer in March. ""I never got to say goodbye and hadn't seen him since 2019 due to the travel restrictions,"" he said.  ""It's been the hardest thing in the world. Lifting the ban feels much too late, but does mean that I can finally visit my step-mum and help her sort dad's belongings."" Another UK resident, Kate Urquhart, said she would be travel to Los Angeles to see the final concert of American rock band The Monkees' farewell tour in November. ""I was almost resigned to not going,"" she said. ""Today's announcement is great news."" Friday's announcement sheds light on the changes firstannounced back in September. Biden administration officials had initially said the new policy would go into place in ""early November,"" leaving many foreign nationals unsure when to make or adjust their travel plans. Virgin Atlantic CEO Shai Weiss welcomed the move and said it reflected the success of the global vaccine rollout. ""The UK will now be able to strengthen ties with our most important economic partner, the US, boosting trade and tourism as well as reuniting friends, families and business colleagues,"" she said.

Investigation ordered into Covid lab test failings,"The Wolverhampton Science Park houses the offices and laboratories of Immensa Health Clinic The head of the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has ordered an investigation into why it took a month to identify a laboratory giving incorrect Covid test results. Dr Jenny Harries said it was ""not clear yet"" what went wrong at the private lab in Wolverhampton. About 43,000 people in England and Walesmay have been wrongly told their Covid-19 test was negative. Testing at the lab has been suspended and those affected are being contacted. Questions are also being raised around how the lab won a multi-million pound government contract. Covid: Secret filming exposes contamination risk at test results lab Coronavirus testing lab 'chaotic and dangerous', scientist claims Covid tests: 'I trusted my PCR results' Concerns were flagged when people had positive lateral flow tests (LFTs) but negative follow-up PCR results from the lab between 8 September and 12 October. Most of those affected live in south-west England. The error could mean thousands of people infected with Covid were wrongly told to stop isolating, and may have infected others. Dr Harries, chief executive of the UKHSA and head of NHS Test and Trace, said local public health teams had been querying tests over the last few weeks, but it was only in the last few days that the problem was pinpointed. ""It is the location of the laboratory, combined with the geography and the time period, that has allowed us to understand this now,"" she said. ""I want to make sure if there are any further problems with other laboratories we can absolutely spot them as quickly as possible."" Dr Harries said she would conduct ""a serious incident investigation"" to make sure it doesn't happen again. All samples from the lab, where Immensa Health Clinic Ltd runs the testing operations, are now being sent to other labs. UKHSA said all other labs were working normally and there were no technical issues with the test kits themselves. Government records show that Immensa, which was founded in May 2020 just months after the start of the pandemic, has been awarded contracts for Covid testing by the Department of Health valued at Â£181m. It is connected to another company, Dante Labs, which provides genetic sequencing and other laboratory services from offices in Wolverhampton and Cambridge. It also sells private PCR Covid tests to travellers, and is one of 20 companies being investigated by the UK competition watchdog over concerns it may have unfairly treated customers. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said people ""should not be concerned"" by the lab's suspension. ""We're looking into what went wrong with that particular testing centre, but it doesn't affect the overall numbers,"" he said. Only a few thousand out of the 43,000 affected by the wrong result could potentially still be infected now and they will be contacted first, by text and email, to recommend they have another test. Prof Alan McNally, from the University of Birmingham, told the BBC he was ""astonished"" by the revelation and could not work out how so many tests could be incorrect. ""It comes down to quality control and quality assurance, oversight and management,"" he said. ""I cannot fathom the failings that would lead to this level of false negative results."" The UKHSA said about 400,000 samples had been processed by the privately-run lab and it estimated 43,000 people may have been given incorrect negative test results, with 4,000 of those from Wales. Some may also be in the south-east of England and scattered across the country. Graham Loader and his wife went about their normal business after negative PCR results Graham Loader, from Newbury, says his family have had three positive LFTs, all followed by negative PCR tests taken at the testing site at Newbury Showground in West Berkshire. He said each time the family got a positive LFT but negative PCR test, they assumed the LFTs must have been at fault. ""I think we just blamed the LFTs because they were a bit basic,"" he said. ""I thought they must be detecting something from a cold and be an error."" His wife, a school teacher, had felt a bit unwell but didn't have the classic symptoms of coronavirus. She had a negative PCR test but took some time off as a precaution, despite being advised she did not need to. Mr Loader, who coaches a boy's football team, thought he had come down with a cold. He added: ""I completely trusted the PCR, so I feel bad for all the people I've been in contact with."" Dr Will Welfare, public health incident director at UKHSA - which replaced Public Health England, said: ""As a result of our investigation, we are working with NHS Test and Trace and the company to determine the laboratory technical issues which have led to inaccurate PCR results being issued to people. ""We have immediately suspended testing at this laboratory while we continue the investigation."" He said the public should remain confident in using both kinds of test, and continue to get a follow-up PCR test after a positive LFT. The company said it was ""fully collaborating"" with health officials on the matter and added it had already analysed more than 2.5 million samples for NHS Test and Trace. Many coronavirus testing sites in England and Wales are likely to be affected by the lab errors, including one atNewbury Showground used by the Loader family. On Thursday evening West Berkshire council told people who had received a negative result at the site between 3 and 12 October, to book another test. For several weeks, there have beenwidespread reports in the south-west of Englandof people testing positive with LFTs, but then later testing negative after a PCR test. Scientists had called for the issue to be looked into quickly, withone study suggesting positive LFT results were very accurate and should be trusted.

Apple takes down Koran app in China,"Apple has taken down one of the world's most popular Quran apps in China, following a request from officials. Quran Majeed is available across the world on the App Store - and has nearly 150,000 reviews. It is used by millions of Muslims. The BBC understands that the app was removed for hosting illegal religious texts. The Chinese government has not responded to the BBC's request for comment. The deletion of the app was first noticed by Apple Censorship - a website that monitors apps on Apple's App Store globally. In a statement from the app's maker, PDMS, the company said: ""According to Apple, our app Quran Majeed has been removed from the China App store because it includes content that requires additional documentation from Chinese authorities"". ""We are trying to get in touch with the Cyberspace Administration of China and relevant Chinese authorities to get this issue resolved"". The company said it had close to one million users in China. The Chinese Communist Party officially recognises Islam as a religion in the country. However, China has been accused of human rights violations, and even genocide, against the mostly Muslim Uyghur ethnic group in Xinjiang. Earlier this year theBBC reported that Uyghur imams had been targetedin China's Xinjiang crackdown. Apple declined to comment,but directed the BBC to its Human Rights Policy,,externalwhich states: ""We're required to comply with local laws, and at times there are complex issues about which we may disagree with governments."" Screengrab from Quran Majeed promotional material However, it is not clear what rules the app has broken in China. Quran Majeed says it is ""trusted by over 35 million Muslims globally"". Last month, both Apple and Google removed a tactical voting app devised by jailed Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny. Russian authorities had threatened to fine the two companies if they refused to drop the app, which told users who could unseat ruling party candidates. China is one of Apple's biggest markets, and the company's supply chain is heavily reliant on Chinese manufacturing. Apple chief executive Tim Cook has been accused of hypocrisy from politicians in the US for speaking out about American politics, but staying quiet about China. Mr Cook criticised Donald Trump's ban of seven Muslim-majority countries in 2017. However, he is also accused of complying with the Chinese government over censorship - and not publicly criticising it for its treatment of Muslim minorities. The New York Times reported earlier this year,externalthat Apple takes down apps in China if deemed off limits by the Chinese government. Topics that apps cannot discuss include Tiananmen Square, the Chinese spiritual movement Falun Gong, the Dalai Lama, and independence for Tibet and Taiwan. Benjamin Ismail, project director at Apple Censorship, said: ""Currently Apple is being turned into the censorship bureau of Beijing. ""They need to do the right thing, and then face whatever the reaction is of the Chinese government."" Another popular religious app, Olive Tree's Bible app, was also taken down this week in China. The company told the BBC they had removed the app themselves. ""Olive Tree Bible Software was informed during the App Store review process that we are required to provide a permit demonstrating our authorization to distribute an app with book or magazine content in mainland China,"" said a spokesperson. ""Since we did not have the permit and needed to get our app update approved and out to customers, we removed our Bible app from China's App Store."" On Friday, The Mac Observer reported that Audible, the Amazon owned audiobook and podcast service, removed its app from the Apple store in mainland China last month ""due to permit requirements."" On Thursday, Microsoft said it was shutting down its social network, LinkedIn, in China, saying having to comply with the Chinese state had become increasingly challenging. The decision was made after the career-networking site faced questions for blocking the profiles of some journalists.

Sir David Amess stabbing: What we know so far,"Conservative MP Sir David Amess died after being stabbed multiple times at his Essex constituency surgery, in what police are treating as a terrorist incident. Here's how the attack unfolded and what we know so far. The MP for Southend West was stabbed at Belfairs Methodist Church in Leigh-on-Sea, in Essex. He was there for one of his regular Friday meetings with his constituents. Just 15 minutes before the attack, the 69-year-old was standing on the church steps, chatting and laughing with locals. At about 12:05 BST on Friday, Sir David walked into the church alongside two female members of his staff to meet more constituents. Local councillor John Lamb said that it was then a man emerged from a small group of waiting constituents and attacked Sir David, stabbing him several times. Mr Lamb later shared the accounts of Sir David's two assistants. He described how one was in the room with Sir David taking notes. ""All of a sudden there was a scream from her, because the person deliberately whipped out a knife and started stabbing David. ""The other lady, who was getting names from people outside, she came running in and saw poor David had been stabbed."" Police arrived at the scene in Eastwood Road North within minutes where they found the MP with multiple injuries and arrested a man. How a tragic day unfolded in Leigh-on-Sea Obituary: Conservative MP Sir David Amess ""We knew it must be very serious because the paramedics had been working on Sir David for over two-and-a-half hours and they hadn't got him on the way to hospital,"" Mr Lamb told the PA news agency. At 14:13 an air ambulance arrived at a nearby sports ground to move him to hospital. However, members of his team began to fear the worst as paramedics remained at the scene. Shortly before 15:00, Essex Police said Sir David had died. At 13:50 on Friday, Essex Police confirmed a 25-year-old man had been arrested immediately at the scene on suspicion of murder, and that a knife had been recovered. Whitehall officials have confirmed to the BBC that the suspect - who is being held at a London police station under the Terrorism Act 2000 - is Ali Harbi Ali, a British national of Somali heritage. He was born in Southwark in south London and grew up in Croydon, and is the son of a former adviser to a previous Somali prime minister and the nephew of the Somali ambassador to China. In his teenage years he was referred to the government's extremism programme Prevent but was never a formal ""subject of interest"" for MI5. Ali Harbi Ali is being detained at a London police station Prevent is the UK's terrorism-prevention programme, which aims to stop people being radicalised. Teachers, members of the public, the NHS and others can refer individuals to a local panel of police, social workers and other experts who decide whether and how to intervene in their lives. Engagement in the scheme is voluntary and it is not a criminal sanction. It is thought Mr Ali did not spend long in the programme. The attack has been declared a terrorist incident by police. The early investigation revealed ""a potential motivation linked to Islamist extremism"", according to Metropolitan Police's Counter Terrorism Command. But it is still not exactly clear why Sir David in particular was targeted, Daniel Sandford, the BBC's home affairs correspondent said. Ali Harbi Ali was initially detained on suspicion of murder but was further detained under the Terrorism Act late on Friday. On Saturday, detectives were granted a warrant by magistrates to allow them to keep Mr Ali in custody until Friday 22 October. The suspect is still being questioned and has not been charged. Police searches have taken place over the weekend at properties in Lady Somerset Road, in Kentish Town, and Bounds Green Road in north London and Cranmer Road, Croydon. A post-mortem examination of Sir David has taken place, the police added. Labour's Sir Keir Starmer (left) and PM Boris Johnson visited the scene to lay flowers on Saturday Anthony Finch, who was working nearby, told Sky News: ""We arrived to do some work on the adjacent building... and at the point when I was crossing the road I saw an upset lady on the phone saying 'you need to arrive quickly, he's still in the building.'"" He said he had seen armed police, as well as an air ambulance and police helicopter. He told LBC: ""It's very odd and it's very distressing, that's for sure."" Lee Jordison, who works for a local butchers and was on the scene shortly after the stabbing, told the BBC everyone in the area was in a state of shock. ""Something like this doesn't happen - not in all the years I've been round this way."" Sir David, who was married with five children, served as an MP for 38 years, initially in Basildon from 1983, before representing Southend West from 1997. Raised as a Roman Catholic, he was known politically as a social conservative and a prominent campaigner against abortion. He was also a committed campaigner on animal welfare issues, and supported a ban on fox hunting. Tributes paid to Sir David Amess The 69-year-old was a Brexit supporter and vocal champion for the town he represented, particularly in his long-running campaign to make Southend a city. Helaunched a new bid,externallast month, after a city status competition was announced to mark the Queen's platinum jubilee next year. While he was never a minister, he was a member of numerous Commons committees, including the Health and Social Care and Backbench Business Committees. Born in Plaistow, east London, in 1952, he went to school in the capital and taught at a school in the city. He was a recruitment consultant before becoming an MP. He was knighted in the 2015 New Year's Honours List for political and public service. His family saidin a statement that their hearts had been shatteredand ""nobody should die in that way"". They called on people to show kindness and love and ""set aside hatred and work towards togetherness"".

Foreign drivers to be allowed more UK deliveries,"The rules on the number of deliveries overseas lorry drivers can make in the UK are set to be relaxed in a bid to tackle supply chain problems in the run-up to Christmas. Under the new plans, drivers will be able to make unlimited deliveries or collections within a 14 day period. Currently EU drivers can only make two pick-ups or drop-offs each week. It is hoped the changes will happen by December - but UK drivers fear they might lose work to cheaper EU rivals. The UK's lorry driver shortage - due to a combination of Covid, Brexit and other factors - has affected petrol stations, supermarkets and left containers piled up at Felixstowe Port unable to be moved. Retailers have also warned there could be shortages of items such as toys at Christmas, with shoppers urged to buy gifts early. Why is there an HGV driver shortage? Toy shops warn of Christmas shortages amid delays 'We've run out of Harry Potter stock' Last month,the government announced it would grantup to 5,000 temporary visas for HGV drivers from abroad - but so far only a fraction have been issued. And the first foreign drivers brought in on the visa scheme may not even arrive for another month, sources have told BBC transport correspondent Carrie Davies. But now ministers are going further, andplan to make temporary changes to cabotage rules,,externalwhich govern how many jobs a haulier can make in a foreign country. It means foreign HGV drivers that come into the country laden with goods can pick up and drop off items an unlimited number of times for two weeks before they return home. The changes still need to be approved after a one-week consultation - but if passed they will come into force ""towards the end of this year for up to six months"", according to the government. It would mean thousands more HGV deliveries each month, the government said, so more goods - especially food and items that come via ports - can get delivered on schedule. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps told BBC Breakfast: ""Having some additional capacity right now... it is a good idea. This is a quick way of doing it. It doesn't require visas, it's just a common sense measure. ""It is one of very many things. I don't think it is going to undercut or suppress the market."" Mr Shapps said problems with supply chains were a global issue. He added: ""It is very tight but our supply chain is pretty robust. They have worked through coronavirus and they will work through this as well."" This video can not be played HGV driver shortage: Workers on their working conditions amid shortage But the haulage industry said the measures would undercut British operators. Rod McKenzie, from the Road Haulage Association, told BBC's Today programme: ""Well, I spoke to some of our members last night, and they were appalled. 'Ridiculous', 'pathetic', 'gobsmacked' were some of their more broadcastable comments. ""The government has been talking about a high-wage, high-skill economy, and not pulling the lever marked 'uncontrolled immigration', and to them this is exactly what it looks like. ""Allowing overseas haulage companies and drivers to come over for up to six months on a fortnightly basis to do unlimited work at low rates, undercutting UK hauliers whoâ¦ are facing an acute driver shortage, rising costs, staff wages. ""So this is about taking work from British operators and drivers and giving it to Europeans who don't pay tax here and pay peanuts to their drivers. ""We don't want cabotage [the transportation of goods in one country by operators from another] to sabotage our industry."" The Unite union has raised the prospect of possible industrial action in protest at what it sees as poor pay and conditions in the industry. ""The treatment of drivers across the board has been nothing short of a disgrace,"" said Unite general secretary Sharon Graham. ""As the prime minister said recently, the answer to the driver shortage is better wages and improved conditions. This is what we demand. ""Now is the time for action not words. It's time for employers to pay workers a proper rate for the job. ""Unite will be consulting its members before deciding on next steps, including exploring the options for industrial action."" Mr Shapps said the long-term answer to the supply chain issues ""must be developing a high-skill, high-wage economy here in the UK"". But talking about the latest measures, he said: ""The temporary changes we're consulting on to cabotage rules will also make sure foreign hauliers in the UK can use their time effectively and get more goods moving in the supply chain at a time of high demand."" According to France's finance minister, the UK is faring worse in the supply chain crisis because it left the single market after Brexit. ""We are facing the same situation,""said Bruno Le Maireat the G7 meeting in Washington. ""But the fact that we are a member of a very important single market helps us facing these bottlenecks."" On Thursday,the government said it was alsogiving hundreds of foreign abattoir workers temporary visas, to help fix the shortage of workers in slaughterhouses. The shortage of staff in abattoirs means pigs are not being killed fast enough, and there is not enough space on farms so farmers are having to kill them themselves. Farmers have already destroyed 6,600 healthy pigs due to a backlog on farms, the National Pig Association said.

Military drafted in to under-pressure NHS boards,"Military personnel will join two health boards in Scotland on 19 October The military will be drafted in to hospitals in Lanarkshire and the Borders to relieve pressure ahead of the winter. A total of 86 personnel will be deployed - 63 to NHS Lanarkshire and 23 to NHS Borders - ranging from nurses, medics, general troops and drivers. Support personnel will be from the navy but the medically qualified staff will be from the Army. All will be working in areas like accident and emergency. It follows a request for assistance from the Scottish government. The British Medical Association (Scotland) has called on politicians to ""be honest"" about what the NHS can deliver now and over winter. Health Secretary Humza Yousaf said the health service was experiencing ""significant pressure"" because of Covid admissions and a backlog in care built up over the course of the pandemic. NHS Borders 'busier than any of the busiest winters' Military to be called in to help Scottish ambulance crews NHS Lanarkshire halts non-urgent procedures ""In the NHS Borders and NHS Lanarkshire areas, staff shortages because of Covid-19 are affecting bed capacity,"" he added. ""With increasing levels of social mixing and close social contact it is expected that this winter Covid-19 will circulate alongside respiratory viruses, such as flu, adding to the winter pressures usually faced by the NHS. ""This military support will allow both boards to support existing staff to reduce waiting times, enhance care and provide a better experience for our patients."" NHS Lanarkshire will receive three nurses, 45 medics, 12 general troops and three drivers, while 14 medics, two nurses, one driver and four additional personnel will be sent to NHS Borders. A further two military medics will oversee the operation from the army's headquarters in Scotland. Personnel are due to start work on 19 October and continue until 10 November, though the Scottish government said this would be kept under ""constant review"". The MoD has assisted health services across the country, including with vaccination Judith Park, NHS Lanarkshire's director of acute services, said all three hospitals in the health board - Monklands, Hairmyres and Wishaw - would be supported. She said: ""Staff shortages because of Covid-19 are affecting bed capacity and the approval of temporary military assistance on our hospital sites is very welcome over the next few weeks as we begin to see winter illnesses circulate alongside Covid adding to the pressures we face."" The request for support comes after soldiers were brought in tosupport the Scottish Ambulance Servicein September. At the time Nicola Sturgeon said health services were dealing with the most challenging combination of circumstances in their history due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The military also provided advice on the construction of the NHS Louisa Jordan field hospital in Glasgow and set up and ran testing programmes as well as vaccination centres across Scotland. Army personnel were brought in to assist the Scottish Ambulance Service in September Health services in all UK nations have received support from the armed forces in recent months. Scottish Secretary Alistair Jack said he was glad they were able to step in again. He added: ""Nearly 90 army medical personnel and support staff will be working at the front line of Scotland's NHS. We are grateful for all their efforts to keep us safe."" However senior doctors have said while military help is welcomed, it will be a short term measure and will ""barely scratch the surface"" of providing the staff that is needed. Dr Lewis Morrison, chair of BMA Scotland, said: ""It demonstrates that things are on a knife edge in the areas where this is happening - but there are many other places where staff are spread incredibly thinly and close to if not at the same level of pressure. ""We need politicians on all sides to be honest with the public about what the NHS can deliver right now and over this expected long winter. ""Each passing week and story of a service in crisis underlines the urgent need for a clear workforce plan to address those huge short, medium and long term staffing issues and a plan that focuses firstly and squarely on caring for and retaining the staff we have because recruiting extra people takes time."" Members of the Royal Scots Dragoon Guard set up a vaccination centre at the Donald Dewar Sports Centre in Drumchapel earlier this year The Scottish Conservative's health spokesman Dr Sandesh Gulhane called the Mr Yousaf's winter plan ""belated"" and said the effects were being ""keenly felt"" by staff. He said: ""We aren't even into the peak winter period, yet my colleagues on the frontline are already well beyond breaking point. ""He must now urgently guarantee the support from our military will be maximised at every turn for these health boards. Otherwise a truly terrible winter in our NHS is set to occur on his watch."" Both the Borders and Lanarkshire health boards have already halted all non-urgent procedures. Last month the medical director of NHS Borders urged the public to""be kind"" to staff facing ""unprecedented challenges"". Dr Lynn McCallum said they were busier than in the ""busiest winter"".

Rail union rejects pay offer to avoid COP26 strikes,"A pay offer to avoid Scotland's rail network being crippled by strikes during COP26 is ""is not worthy of consideration"", a union has said. The RMT said members who work for ScotRail and Caledonian Sleeperwill stage industrial action during the UN climate summit in Glasgow. The dispute is linked to an ongoing row over pay which has affected Sunday services in recent months. ScotRail said its latest two-year offer of 4.7% was ""very reasonable"". But Michael Hogg, from the RMT union, said it would not ballot ScotRail workers on a deal he described as ""rotten"" and ""lousy"" as it also involved efficiency savings. That would mean workers having to give up some current terms and conditions in order to get a pay rise, a caveat Mr Hogg branded ""unacceptable"". Mr Hogg told BBC Radio'sGood Morning Scotlandprogramme there will be no trains running anywhere in Scotland during COP26 if the strikes go ahead. He added: ""Our representatives do not feel that this offer is worthy of consideration. It's a kick in the teeth to key, essential workers."" On Thursday, it was announced staff will strike from 00:01 on Monday 1 November until 23:59 on Friday 12 November. The global COP26 summit, which is expected to draw thousands of people to Glasgow, runs from 31 October until 12 November. Sleeper staff will strike on Sunday 31 October from 11:59 until 11:58 hours on Tuesday 2 November and again for 48 hours on Thursday 11 November from 11:59. GMB cleansing workers in Glasgow and Unite's Stagecoach staff have also voted to strike during COP26. ScotRail and Caledonian Sleeper strike confirmed during COP26 Why are ScotRail workers striking during COP26? New pay offer in bid to halt ScotRail strikes ScotRail operations manager David Simpson told Good Morning Scotland ""a very positive offer"" was made to the union last weekend and he had expected it to be put to the RMT's members. But instead it called a strike, a move he said was ""very frustrating and very disappointing"". Mr Simpson denied ScotRail had been ""stonewalling"" the union and said the pandemic had prompted more discussion over the last 18 months than ever before. He added: ""Many workers would say 4.7% over two years is anything but a derisory offer and it compares well with other industries."" All scheduled trains will be cancelled if the strikes go ahead Kathryn Darbandi, managing director for Serco Caledonian Sleeper, said any action during the climate summit would be incredibly damaging. She said: ""We have repeatedly tabled realistic and reasonable offers which we believe should have ended the dispute. ""Industrial action during COP26 - when the eyes of the world will be on Scotland - risks both the reputation of rail as an environmentally-friendly and sustainable mode of transport, but also the great progress the entire team at Caledonian Sleeper have made in building back the confidence of our guests. ""The RMT's action does not reflect the reality of the financial situation facing all parties in Scotland's railway today, as we seek to rebuild the industry for the future. We need to work together, and we continue to be open to realistic discussions."" The climate summit will be held at the Scottish Events Campus in Glasgow Transport Minister Graeme Dey said that the RMT was in receipt of a ""very fair"" pay proposal. And he told Good Morning Scotland many of its members will have voted for strike action ""unaware of the offer that is now on the table"". Mr Dey also described the two-year deal, which he said has been backed by the three other unions involved, was ""the best offer that can be made in the circumstances"". But Scottish Conservative transport spokesman Graham Simpson accused the Scottish government of distancing themselves from the dispute. He said: ""Glasgow is about to take centre stage in a matter of weeks, and the SNP are still claiming they have no idea why rail strikes are continuing. ""SNP ministers must work with all parties to find a solution before these persisting strikes cast a shadow over the COP26 conference."" It is the latest stage in a long-running dispute over pay and conditions and proposed cuts to services at the rail operator, which wants to reduce the number of services across Scotlandby 300 a day from next May. ScotRail is currently run by Dutch firm Abellio - but will be taken over by acompany owned and controlled by the Scottish governmentin March next year. The move was announced by the government earlier this year after Abellio wasstripped of its contractthree years early amid concern over its performance. Transport Scotland said it welcomed constructive talks between all parties and that a ""significant offer"" has been made by employers since the RMT ballot opened. A spokeswoman said: ""We understand that the RMT will now ballot its membership again on the substance of this offer. We hope that RMT members and the other unions will agree and accept this offer, putting to an end existing and proposed industrial disputes and action. ""Rail workers have played their part in keeping the country moving through the pandemic and we are sure that they will see the importance of the moment and the role they can play in showing the best Scotland's Railway has to offer as we welcome world leaders from across the globe to COP26."" Meanwhile, Chris Mitchell of the GMB denied cleansing workers in Glasgow were using the global climate conference as a bargaining chip. Mr Mitchell claimed his members had been ""put in a corner"" by Cosla despite their ""heroic efforts"" during the pandemic. And he told Good Morning Scotland the current pay offer of Â£850 a year would only amount to an extra Â£6.50 a week, after tax and National Insurance was taken off. Mr Mitchell said he acknowledged the importance of COP26, but added: ""Cosla need to realise there is an emergency on their own door step."" The COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives.

'Exhausted' walker lost for two nights in Cairngorms,"David Wightman (left) and Colin Marshall are both experienced walkers A lost walker survived two nights in the Cairngorms while a helicopter and mountain rescue teams searched for him. David Wightman spent an exhausting weekend alone and exposed to the elements after becoming separated from his walking companion, Colin Marshall. When Mr Marshall managed to raise the alarm, a major search and rescue operation was launched. Mr Wightman, 62, was eventually found by students who shared their food with him before he was airlifted to safety. ""I just have a huge debt to all of these people. It's been quite a humbling experience,"" he told BBC Scotland'sThe Nine. The pair were walking in the Ben Macdui area, heading to Corrour bothy, when they lost one another in poor weather on Friday. ""I lost visibility,"" Mr Wightman, from near Southend-on-Sea in Essex, said. ""My mistake at that point was not shouting or whistling, in the certainty in my mind that I knew which way he'd gone. ""It's the most stupid mistake to make of course. From that point onwards we were both on our own."" David Wightman spent two nights exposed to the elements in the Cairngorms He eventually decided to find somewhere to keep warm and sheltered from the wind. ""I had some very good luck that the average temperature for October for the Cairngorms was up"", he said. ""I had waterproof clothing on and my bag was serving as a reasonable windbreak on a slab of granite that I found. ""I was able to get through 12 hours of darkness and stay reasonably warm. There were some quite severe shivering fits in the middle of the night. I kept my head torch on in case there was anything coming out to look, but [there was] no sign of any search that night. ""Not knowing what the situation was with my friend I could only keep my fingers crossed he actually got to shelter. I now know that he did do that."" When Mr Marshall raised the alarm, Braemar, Cairngorm and Aberdeen mountain rescue teams were called out, alongside police and search and rescue dogs. The pair were walking the Ben Macdui area when they got into difficulty Mr Wightman described the following day - Saturday - as a ""total disaster"". He recalled: ""When I powered on my phone it told me I only had 15% left. The phone died, and the charger didn't work because moisture had got in it."" He made it to the valley floor of the River Dee, but faced another night in the open. At one point, he spotted the helicopter and its searchlights. He waved his poles and got his bright orange cover out, but he was not spotted. ""I know now, and... this would have saved me an awful lot of heartache and grief, that if you have a torch, even in the daylight, shine it,"" he said. ""Having waved goodbye to the helicopter, that for me was the lowest point of the whole experience, I then saw in the distance some granite boulders. I tucked myself in as best as possible for another 12 hours."" The following morning he made it to a meeting point of two valleys - he was exhausted and his morale was low. But then he heard voices from the opposite side of the river, shouting: ""Are you David Wightman?"" There were four students from Aberdeen University who had heard that search teams were looking for him. ""From that point the relief was just enormous - I knew this was going to be OK"", he said.

They escorted him to shelter, made cups of tea, and lit a fire. ""They shared their food, peanut butter out the jar - stick your hand in, don't worry - beef jerky, apples, have whatever you like,"" Mr Wightman said. ""It's the kindness of strangers - just restored my faith in human nature."" They used a piece of silver foil to attract the attention of the helicopter searching overhead. He was flown off the hill, and reunited with Mr Marshall, and then his family. Asked if he would one day return to the Cairngorms, Mr Wightman said: ""I love the environment so I could be tempted for sure. ""There are things I would do differently given what has happened. It's a wonderful part of the world.""

LiveLiveLatest after MP killed in stabbing attack5 minutes ago,"Police say they are treating the killing of MP Sir David Amess as a terrorist incident There is a potential link to Islamist extremism, and counter-terrorism officers are searching two addresses in the London area The Conservative MP was stabbed multiple times in the attack in Leigh-on-Sea, Essex, on Friday Boris Johnson and the Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer have laid flowers at the scene Home Secretary Priti Patel says Sir David was killed doing a job he loved Ms Patel, who also has an Essex constituency, calls Sir David a ""dear and loyal friend"" A 25-year-old British man is being held in police custody on suspicion of murder Government sources tell the BBC he is a UK national who, from initial inquiries, appears to be of Somali heritage Edited by Emma Atkinson We are bringing our live updates on the killing of Essex MP Sir David Amess to a close for the evening. The page was written by George Bowden, Jennifer Meierhans, Katy Lewis, Kate Whannel and Mariam Issimdar. It was edited by Alex Kleiderman, Emma Atkinson and Owen Amos. The mood in Leigh-on-Sea tonight is sombre as people express their sadness and bewilderment at the fatal stabbing of their MP. Sir David Amess's constituents speak warmly ofa man who dedicated his life to serving them. Prime Minister Boris Johnson calls Sir David one of the ""kindest, nicest, most gentle people in politics"". And deputy PM Dominic Rabb says he was ""a formidable campaigner with a big heart, and tremendous generosity of spirit - including towards those he disagreed with"". A fixture in the House of Commons chamber for nearly 40 years he was known as one of Parliament's characters: fun, friendly, unconventional and outspoken. He always took his work seriously, but himself rarely. Here's what we know so far about the investigation into the fatal stabbing of Essex MP Sir David Amess.  We've got more detail on what we know about the investigation so farhere.  Lord
Walney, independent adviser to the government on political violence and disruption, says he can imagine a discreet police presence at constituency
events would be an attractive option for many MPs. The former Labour MP told BBC Radio 4's PM programme: âIt is not
simply the awful tragic violent act that took the life of David Amess and my
friend Jo Cox. ""It is also that sense of intimidation, if that prevents people
coming into parliament in future, and puts pressure on people to act
differently or step down that in itself is a huge attack on our democracy and
itâs something that we must be concerned about and take serious steps to
address.â Asked if he will make any recommendations for security measures
to ensure MPs physical safety, Walney says he thinks we will see the
Speaker of the House of Commons stepping up the levels of security. A Labour MP has
expressed caution over the idea that constituency surgeries should be observed
by police officers for protection, following the death of Sir David. Diane Abbott,
who served as Shadow Home Secretary under Jeremy Corbyn, says it could risk putting people off from visiting their local MP. Speaking to
Caroline Wyatt on BBC Radio 4 PM, she says: ""Iâve been talking to colleagues - there was one in North London who
was telling me that because of death threats she had a police officer outside
her advice session - and a police car in fact. Well of course the number of
people coming to see her dropped right down. ""You donât want to have a set-up
which is so off putting to ordinary people that just want help. So I wouldnât
support airport-style screening. âI would prefer, going forward, to meet constituents behind a screen, as we have now for Covid
and so on - that might be quite complicated to arrange but at least you know
someoneâs not going to just lean over the desk and stab you, which could happen
now.â People in Southend came together this afternoon at the town's Civic Centre to hold a vigil and reflect on the life of the MP David Amess and light candles. As tributes continue to pour in for Essex MP Sir David Amess let's take stock of what's happened since he was killed while meeting constituents in Leigh-on-Sea yesterday. Labour MP Naz Shah says there is ""no right or wrong answer"" over whether or not MPs should continue holding their surgeries. The Bradford West MP - who has received death threats in the past - says the attack on Sir David ""could have happened to any of us"". ""I just think you've got to respect every MP - some will have the 'Yes, we're going to carry on' view, and some people won't feel comfortable."" The West Papua independence leader Benny Wendahas sent,externalhis condolences to the family of Sir David Amess. He says he was one of the first MPs to sign the Westminster Declaration for West Papua and would ""always be fondly remembered by West Papuans"". The Westminster Declaration calls for an internationally supervised vote on independence from Indonesia for West Papua and has been signed by parliamentarians around the world.

The killing of MP Sir David Amess has highlighted a security dilemma forpoliticians across the globe. Some of the BBC's international correspondents explain what the situation is like in other countries. BBC South American correspondent Katy Watson says being an open, accessible people's representative in the major cities of Brazil - Sao Paolo and Rio de Janeiro - where wealth and inequalities are polarised, politicians are more likely to be flanked by bodyguards. Brazil is deeply divided politically and President Jair Bolsonaro was stabbed during his leadership campaign. Being an MP in India - the world's largest democracy - comes with a lot of privileges, a security detail is one of them, writes Vikas Pandey in Delhi. In recent years, attacks on politicians have taken the form of ink-throwing and slapping. But a number of politicians, including former PMs Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi, have lost their lives in violent attacks. In the Netherlands, Dutch lawmakers do not hold surgeries and only a select few Dutch politicians, including the anti-Islam leader, Geert Wilders, have protection. The prime minister, Mark Rutte, pictured below, has been seen cycling to meetings. Read the full story on the struggle politicians face to meet the public and stay safe. People have come together at Southend Civic Centre for a moment of reflection on Sir David's life. Mohammed Shamsuddin says he had known Sir David since 1983 and describes him as ""English gentleman who was so kind to our community as well as the whole of Southend"". Ruhul Shamsuddin, Joint Secretary of Essex Jamme Masjid says he had known Sir David since he was a child. He says: ""For his life to be cut short is devastating."" Mahmudul Hasan says: ""We greatly miss him and he will be always missed."" Claire Calder from the Dogs Trust says Sir David Amess was ""one of the biggest champions of animal welfare in Parliament"". She praises the MP's ""huge sense of humour"" and ""huge heart"". Recently, she says he had joined their campaigns to tackle puppy smuggling and to ban electric shock collars. Next week is the annual Westminster dog of the year contest run by the Dogs Trust and the Kennel Club. Sir David had been planning to enter his French bulldog into the contest. Allow Twitter content?

The fuel poverty charity National Energy Action describes Sir David as ""a true public servant"". The charity said the MP would be remembered for his bill aimed at eliminating fuel poverty - the Warm Homes and Energy Conservation Bill. The bill required the government to publish and implement a strategy to reduce fuel poverty and became law in 2000. A spokesperson for the NEA said Sir David's family could ""take some small comfort from knowing the huge positive difference he has made"". ""Millions of people across the UK are now better supported through national policies and programmes than before he started his campaign and he has directly helped millions of people to be warmer and safer in their homes."" London Mayor Sadiq Khan says his thoughts are with Sir David Amess' family at ""this time of unimaginable grief"". He describes the Essex MP as ""a brilliant, kind, dedicated public
servant, widely liked and respected across the political divide"". He adds: ""Iâm utterly disgusted
by this attack on our democracy. âLike with the murder of my dear friend Jo Cox five years ago, it appears that the horrific killing of Sir David Amess was another attempt to divide us, to fuel fear and to change how we treat one another."" ""Our response must be to stand united in defiance and stay true to our values and way of life.""  We've been reporting that some MPs are holding their usual surgeries in their constituencies following the death of Sir David Amess. Among them is Craig Williams, MP for Montgomeryshire, who met voters alongside his Conservative colleague from the Welsh Parliament, Russell George. Allow Twitter content?

Kieran Mullan, the Tory MP for Crewe and Nantwich,tweeted:,external""Surgery today, we must not let people force us to do things differently. David would not have wanted that."" Dominic CascianiHome Affairs Correspondent There's no indication that the national terrorism threat level is going to be changed to a higher level in light of the attack. The threat level is currently ""substantial"" which is in the middle of the five tiers. It means the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre, which is part of MI5, thinks that an attack is ""likely"". It's been at that level since February. The two levels above it are typically triggered when there are ongoing concerns among counter terrorism leaders of an emerging plot or remaining questions about an incident that's already taken place. Members of Southend-On-Seaâs Muslim communities are paying tribute to Sir David Amess as a community leader, friend and mentor. A joint statement from all the mosques in the town says: ""He shared in our happiness, by attending our weddings and functions and he was there for us in our times of need.  We will all miss him dearly, but his legacy of public service will live on, as will memories of his warmth, selflessness and kindness."" It says: ""Sir Davidâs murder was an indefensible atrocity, commited on the grounds of a place of worship and we condemn it in the strongest possible terms.This act was committed in the name of blind hatred, and we look forward to the perpetrator being brought to justice."" Ruhul Shamsuddin, joint secretary of Essex Jamme Masjid
remembers Sir David as ""a tremendous force for good"" and ""a truly
wonderful man"". ""Itâs an honour to say Iâve known him my whole life. Iâve lost not just a community leader, but a
family friend and mentor.â President of Ireland, Michael D Higgins, has sent his condolences to Sir David's family. He said he was killed while carrying out a fundamental role of a politician - helping their constituents. He offered his ""deepest sympathies to the family, friends, colleagues in Parliament and constituents"" of Sir David. He also extended thoughts to the family of the late Jo Cox MP, murdered just over five years ago in her constituency of Batley and Spen. ""On behalf of the Irish people, I send them our deepest sympathies."" TheBritish-Irish Parliamentary Assembly,external(BIPA) has cancelled a scheduled plenary meeting at Westminster on Monday as a mark of respect for Sir David.

LiveLiveLatest after MP killed in stabbing attackLess than a minute ago,"Police say they are treating the killing of MP Sir David Amess as a terrorist incident There is a potential link to Islamist extremism, and counter-terrorism officers are searching two addresses in the London area The Conservative MP was stabbed multiple times in the attack in Leigh-on-Sea, Essex, on Friday Boris Johnson and the Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer have laid flowers at the scene Home Secretary Priti Patel says Sir David was killed doing a job he loved Ms Patel, who also has an Essex constituency, calls Sir David a ""dear and loyal friend"" A 25-year-old British man is being held in police custody on suspicion of murder Government sources tell the BBC he is a UK national who, from initial inquiries, appears to be of Somali heritage Edited by Emma Atkinson We are bringing our live updates on the killing of Essex MP Sir David Amess to a close for the evening. The page was written by George Bowden, Jennifer Meierhans, Katy Lewis, Kate Whannel and Mariam Issimdar. It was edited by Alex Kleiderman, Emma Atkinson and Owen Amos. The mood in Leigh-on-Sea tonight is sombre as people express their sadness and bewilderment at the fatal stabbing of their MP. Sir David Amess's constituents speak warmly ofa man who dedicated his life to serving them. Prime Minister Boris Johnson calls Sir David one of the ""kindest, nicest, most gentle people in politics"". And deputy PM Dominic Rabb says he was ""a formidable campaigner with a big heart, and tremendous generosity of spirit - including towards those he disagreed with"". A fixture in the House of Commons chamber for nearly 40 years he was known as one of Parliament's characters: fun, friendly, unconventional and outspoken. He always took his work seriously, but himself rarely. Here's what we know so far about the investigation into the fatal stabbing of Essex MP Sir David Amess.  We've got more detail on what we know about the investigation so farhere.  Lord
Walney, independent adviser to the government on political violence and disruption, says he can imagine a discreet police presence at constituency
events would be an attractive option for many MPs. The former Labour MP told BBC Radio 4's PM programme: âIt is not
simply the awful tragic violent act that took the life of David Amess and my
friend Jo Cox. ""It is also that sense of intimidation, if that prevents people
coming into parliament in future, and puts pressure on people to act
differently or step down that in itself is a huge attack on our democracy and
itâs something that we must be concerned about and take serious steps to
address.â Asked if he will make any recommendations for security measures
to ensure MPs physical safety, Walney says he thinks we will see the
Speaker of the House of Commons stepping up the levels of security. A Labour MP has
expressed caution over the idea that constituency surgeries should be observed
by police officers for protection, following the death of Sir David. Diane Abbott,
who served as Shadow Home Secretary under Jeremy Corbyn, says it could risk putting people off from visiting their local MP. Speaking to
Caroline Wyatt on BBC Radio 4 PM, she says: ""Iâve been talking to colleagues - there was one in North London who
was telling me that because of death threats she had a police officer outside
her advice session - and a police car in fact. Well of course the number of
people coming to see her dropped right down. ""You donât want to have a set-up
which is so off putting to ordinary people that just want help. So I wouldnât
support airport-style screening. âI would prefer, going forward, to meet constituents behind a screen, as we have now for Covid
and so on - that might be quite complicated to arrange but at least you know
someoneâs not going to just lean over the desk and stab you, which could happen
now.â People in Southend came together this afternoon at the town's Civic Centre to hold a vigil and reflect on the life of the MP David Amess and light candles. As tributes continue to pour in for Essex MP Sir David Amess let's take stock of what's happened since he was killed while meeting constituents in Leigh-on-Sea yesterday. Labour MP Naz Shah says there is ""no right or wrong answer"" over whether or not MPs should continue holding their surgeries. The Bradford West MP - who has received death threats in the past - says the attack on Sir David ""could have happened to any of us"". ""I just think you've got to respect every MP - some will have the 'Yes, we're going to carry on' view, and some people won't feel comfortable."" The West Papua independence leader Benny Wendahas sent,externalhis condolences to the family of Sir David Amess. He says he was one of the first MPs to sign the Westminster Declaration for West Papua and would ""always be fondly remembered by West Papuans"". The Westminster Declaration calls for an internationally supervised vote on independence from Indonesia for West Papua and has been signed by parliamentarians around the world.

The killing of MP Sir David Amess has highlighted a security dilemma forpoliticians across the globe. Some of the BBC's international correspondents explain what the situation is like in other countries. BBC South American correspondent Katy Watson says being an open, accessible people's representative in the major cities of Brazil - Sao Paolo and Rio de Janeiro - where wealth and inequalities are polarised, politicians are more likely to be flanked by bodyguards. Brazil is deeply divided politically and President Jair Bolsonaro was stabbed during his leadership campaign. Being an MP in India - the world's largest democracy - comes with a lot of privileges, a security detail is one of them, writes Vikas Pandey in Delhi. In recent years, attacks on politicians have taken the form of ink-throwing and slapping. But a number of politicians, including former PMs Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi, have lost their lives in violent attacks. In the Netherlands, Dutch lawmakers do not hold surgeries and only a select few Dutch politicians, including the anti-Islam leader, Geert Wilders, have protection. The prime minister, Mark Rutte, pictured below, has been seen cycling to meetings. Read the full story on the struggle politicians face to meet the public and stay safe. People have come together at Southend Civic Centre for a moment of reflection on Sir David's life. Mohammed Shamsuddin says he had known Sir David since 1983 and describes him as ""English gentleman who was so kind to our community as well as the whole of Southend"". Ruhul Shamsuddin, Joint Secretary of Essex Jamme Masjid says he had known Sir David since he was a child. He says: ""For his life to be cut short is devastating."" Mahmudul Hasan says: ""We greatly miss him and he will be always missed."" Claire Calder from the Dogs Trust says Sir David Amess was ""one of the biggest champions of animal welfare in Parliament"". She praises the MP's ""huge sense of humour"" and ""huge heart"". Recently, she says he had joined their campaigns to tackle puppy smuggling and to ban electric shock collars. Next week is the annual Westminster dog of the year contest run by the Dogs Trust and the Kennel Club. Sir David had been planning to enter his French bulldog into the contest. Allow Twitter content?

The fuel poverty charity National Energy Action describes Sir David as ""a true public servant"". The charity said the MP would be remembered for his bill aimed at eliminating fuel poverty - the Warm Homes and Energy Conservation Bill. The bill required the government to publish and implement a strategy to reduce fuel poverty and became law in 2000. A spokesperson for the NEA said Sir David's family could ""take some small comfort from knowing the huge positive difference he has made"". ""Millions of people across the UK are now better supported through national policies and programmes than before he started his campaign and he has directly helped millions of people to be warmer and safer in their homes."" London Mayor Sadiq Khan says his thoughts are with Sir David Amess' family at ""this time of unimaginable grief"". He describes the Essex MP as ""a brilliant, kind, dedicated public
servant, widely liked and respected across the political divide"". He adds: ""Iâm utterly disgusted
by this attack on our democracy. âLike with the murder of my dear friend Jo Cox five years ago, it appears that the horrific killing of Sir David Amess was another attempt to divide us, to fuel fear and to change how we treat one another."" ""Our response must be to stand united in defiance and stay true to our values and way of life.""  We've been reporting that some MPs are holding their usual surgeries in their constituencies following the death of Sir David Amess. Among them is Craig Williams, MP for Montgomeryshire, who met voters alongside his Conservative colleague from the Welsh Parliament, Russell George. Allow Twitter content?

Dominic CascianiHome Affairs Correspondent There's no indication that the national terrorism threat level is going to be changed to a higher level in light of the attack. The threat level is currently ""substantial"" which is in the middle of the five tiers. It means the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre, which is part of MI5, thinks that an attack is ""likely"". It's been at that level since February. The two levels above it are typically triggered when there are ongoing concerns among counter terrorism leaders of an emerging plot or remaining questions about an incident that's already taken place. Members of Southend-On-Seaâs Muslim communities are paying tribute to Sir David Amess as a community leader, friend and mentor. A joint statement from all the mosques in the town says: ""He shared in our happiness, by attending our weddings and functions and he was there for us in our times of need.  We will all miss him dearly, but his legacy of public service will live on, as will memories of his warmth, selflessness and kindness."" It says: ""Sir Davidâs murder was an indefensible atrocity, commited on the grounds of a place of worship and we condemn it in the strongest possible terms.This act was committed in the name of blind hatred, and we look forward to the perpetrator being brought to justice."" Ruhul Shamsuddin, joint secretary of Essex Jamme Masjid
remembers Sir David as ""a tremendous force for good"" and ""a truly

family friend and mentor.â President of Ireland, Michael D Higgins, has sent his condolences to Sir David's family. He said he was killed while carrying out a fundamental role of a politician - helping their constituents. He offered his ""deepest sympathies to the family, friends, colleagues in Parliament and constituents"" of Sir David.

Vote over statue of Victorian adventurer StanleyThe future of a statue of controversial explorer HM Stanley goes to a vote in his home town.Wales,"Sir Henry Morton Stanley - but should his statue be removed in Denbigh? The future of a statue in the home town of the controversial Victorian adventurer HM Stanley is being put to a public vote. Residents in the north Wales town of Denbigh are being asked whether they want it removed. Stanley became famous after finding missionary Dr David Livingstone in Tanzania in 1871. But his reputation has been tarnished by claims of violence on explorations, and his role in the Congo. He acted as an agent for King Leopold II of Belgium, and was seen as one of the architects who opened up the African region to the West, only for it to be brutally exploited after he had left. The rule of Leopold II is said to haveled to the deaths of as many as 10 million Africans, though historians dispute the true number. A bronze of Stanley was approved back in 2010 by Denbighshire council,but even then proved divisive. Amid widespread protests from the Black Lives Matter movementfollowing the death of George Floydin the USA, petitions were drawn up calling for the removal of a statue of Stanley in Denbigh and an obelisk honouring him in nearby St Asaph. It was supported by theBishop of St Asaph, Gregory Cameron, who said Stanley had ""little respect for the natives of Africa"". As a result, Denbigh Town Council agreed to hold a public consultation on the statue, which had been delayed until the October vote due to the pandemic. Edward Colston: Torn-down statue 'was an affront' The statues are falling - but what should replace them? From the archives: How do you decide it's time to topple? Gwyneth Kensler, a local county councillor, has long supported keeping the bronze on display outside the town's library. ""The people against Stanley are making all sorts of accusations. They are saying he was racist, he wasn't - he was cruel, he wasn't,"" said Ms Kensler. ""You have to put him in his context - the Victorian period. With Leopold - he knew nothing about the atrocities, and condemned them when he did."" She said the statue should remain where it is, to mark ""Africa's greatest explorer"". Stanley the explorer: This image was taken posing with his African servant in the 1870s Stanley was born John Rowlands in Denbigh, but abandoned by his mother, and grew up in the workhouse at St Asaph. He emigrated to America when he was 18, fighting in its civil war, before embarking on a career as a journalist and explorer. It was in that role he famously searched for Livingstone, where he claimed he uttered the words ""Dr Livingstone I presume"" on finally finding him. But not everyone shared the view that Stanley should be celebrated without question. Denbigh resident Emyr Thomas thinks the statue should be moved from its current location Denbigh resident Emyr Thomas said the bronze should be moved. ""It should be put somewhere, where you can read about it. We need to be able to show the next generation - and our generation - in an appropriate place. ""Then people can make their own minds up about it,"" he said. Dr Marian Gwyn, head of heritage for Race Council Cymru, said the controversy surrounding Stanley was part of his story - and should be discussed. ""I'm not trying to defend Stanley, I'm just trying to be honest,"" she said. ""It was a very violent time throughout - not only was that the environment in Africa, it was violent in Europe as well."" She said many Congolese people still saw Stanley ""as a bit of a hero"" who ""broke the monolithic control of the African chiefs"". Dr Gwyn added: ""It's a very different story to the one we normally hear. But I think we do need to know a lot more about what Stanley was doing over there."" The vote in Denbigh takes place in its town hall on Friday and Saturday. The result, and what it means for the future of the statue, will be discussed when the town's council meets at the end of the month.

Ozone machine school plans scrapped over safety,"Thirty-thousand carbon dioxide monitors are being rolled out in Wales this week Plans to use ozone machines to disinfect classrooms have been abandoned, the Welsh government has confirmed. The machines are potentially""highly harmful"",externalto children, a review found. Ministers were previously accused of making a""spectacular U-turn""after plans for the machines were paused for a safety review. Opposition parties Plaid Cymru and the Welsh Conservatives said they welcomed the move. Classrooms to get Â£6m anti-Covid air technology How fresh air makes school safer Welsh ministers had previously announced they would spend Â£3.31m on 1,800 new ozone machines developed by Swansea University. On Thursday, the Welsh government said this cash would instead be used in schools and colleges to improve ventilation. At the time Swansea University had defended the safety of the machines. The university said ""extensive testing had taken place over eight months"" within its classrooms ""as well as in three very different school scenarios"". However, the Welsh government said aTechnical Advisory Group (TAG) review,externalconcluded that ozone machines are not suitable for use in education settings. The review warned that the gas ozone, which can be used as a disinfectant ""is a highly harmful indoor pollutant which is associated with harm to human health at low concentrations and damages diverse and integral components of indoor environments"". It found that children and those with underlying respiratory conditions were ""particularly sensitive to ozone exposure"" and that the gas ""reacts with a range of compounds present indoors to generate persistent harmful secondary aerosols"". The study also concluded that the evidence for effective ozone disinfection ""is limited in scope and quality"". It said the deployment of an ozone machines would have required ""substantial resources to ensure their safety"". A Gwynedd-based GP, Dr Eilir Hughes, said when the initial announcement about the machines was made, he researched the technology, saying: ""I quickly realised it was a very bad idea. I couldn't even think of a single good reason for doing it."" Speaking to Oliver Hides onBBC Radio Wales Breakfast, Dr Hughes said he believed it was ""bad potentially for human health"" and also the environment if it leaked. Dr Hughes also questioned if it would have been the most effective way of stopping the most dominant strains of Covid spreading. The Welsh Conservatives' education spokeswoman Laura Anne Jones said the Labour policy was ""sadly not thought through"" and that ""educating our young people and keeping them safe has to be the priority"". Sian Gwenllian, Plaid Cymru's education spokeswoman, welcomed the move to ""pull the plug on the controversial and ill-fated ozone machine scheme"", adding the earmarked funding should go towards improving schools' air circulation. More emphasis is being placed on ventilation as the pandemic has continued However, the roll out of carbon dioxide monitors in classrooms, colleges and lecture halls in Wales is to be completed by mid-November, Wales' education minister has said. The monitors will notify teachers and lecturers when CO2 levels rise, so they can identify where ventilation needs to be improved. Wales' Education and Welsh Language Minister Jeremy Miles said the investment for ventilation improvements and carbon dioxide monitor roll out will ""help keep transmission rates low"". Laura Doel, director of teaching union NAHT Cymru, said the body is ""pleased that additional funding will be made available to schools"", however Wales' existing measures ""do not go far enough to support schools"". ""It is crucial that schools do not end up having to foot the bill to fix ventilation problems,"" she added. David Evans, the National Education Union Cymru's secretary, welcomed the ventilation investment, saying it was ""critical to ensuring that education can remain open over the winter for as much of the time as possible"".

LiveLiveSerious incident investigation after wrong Covid results9 minutes ago,"NHS Test and Trace suspends Covid testing provided by a private laboratory in Wolverhampton amid fears up to 43,000 people were given the wrong result Dr Jenny Harries, the head of NHS Test and Trace, says it is not yet clear how or why the laboratory might have given incorrect results Harries adds there will be a ""serious incident investigation"" to ensure there are not problems at other testing laboratories Earlier, a mass testing site in Berkshire asked people who recently got a negative result to book another test It comes after reports that some people received negative PCR tests after testing positive using lateral flow devices But health officials say the problem is ""an isolated incident attributed to one laboratory"" and that they are investigating the cause Separately, travellers returning to England will be able to take cheaper lateral flow tests from 24 October Edited by Hamish Mackay We're bringing our live coverage to a close now, so here's a reminder of the main stories today: We'll be back on Monday with all the latest coronavirus news. In the meantime you can follow our main storyhereorvisit our front pagefor other news. Today's posts were written by Becky Morton and Hazel Shearing and edited by Hamish Mackay. The Scottish governmenthas requested military back-up for two NHS health boardsto relieve pressure ahead of the winter period. NHS Lanarkshire will receive three nurses, 45 medics, 12 general troops and three drivers, while 14 medics, two nurses and four additional personnel will be sent to NHS Borders. Both health boards have already halted all non-urgent procedures, blaming staff shortages and rising patient demand. It comes after soldiers were brought in tosupport the Scottish Ambulance Servicein September. A previously ""active"" and ""energetic"" GP has told the BBC she now has to use a wheelchair due to long Covid. Susannah Thompson, from Blyth, contracted coronavirus last year while working on the NHS frontline, and has since experienced long-lasting symptoms of the virus. The 41-year-old says she struggles to get out of bed and complete day-to-day tasks, but decided to start using a wheelchair to ""regain her independence"" and help others. This video can not be played Coronavirus: Blyth GP using wheelchair due to long Covid Prof Alan McNally, a microbiologist at the University of Birmingham, says he is ""astonished"" by the problems at the private laboratory in Wolverhampton and says they will be the result of ""appropriate controls not being used"". He tells the BBC he ""can't understand how itâs happened at this scale"". âIf you do that test properly with all appropriate controls then there is no way you should have missed sheer volume of false negative results we are talking about here,"" he says. âYou should see if you have this level of systematic failure."" He says it is a question of ""quality control and quality assurance, oversight and management"", adding: ""I cannot fathom the failings that would lead to this level of false negative results."" Boris Johnson was visiting a Rolls Royce factory in Bristol The prime minister says people should not be concerned after thousands may wrongly have been told their Covid tests were negativebecause of errors at a private lab. âWeâre looking into what went wrong with that particular testing centre, but is doesnât affect the overall numbers,"" Boris Johnson says. On a visit to Bristol, he tells reporters: ""Overall, the picture in the South West in the Bristol area and the rest of the country, remains very much where it has been for some time now. We are just getting along in a state of, more or less, an equilibrium."" He says that while there are quite high infection rates, particularly in young people ""that isn't really feeding through into the older generations in the way that we saw in previous spikes"". âThereâs no doubt that the wall of vaccination that the country has built is very high and very effective,"" he adds. He says the overall data shows the government is right to stick with its ""plan A"" for winter - meaning no additional restrictions are needed.  Helen Diggle, who lives in Tellisford in Somerset, says she
had five positive lateral flow tests and three negative PCRs before finally
testing positive for Covid on a PCR test. On one of her visits to a testing centre she said a member
of staff told her she had seen lots of very similar cases recently,
particularly involving local schools. Helen tells BBC News: âIt is really worrying that some
people in the system, people on the ground, have been aware that something is
going on.â When Helen and her 10-year-old daughter kept testing negative on PCRs despite high temperatures and positive lateral flow tests
she knew something was not right. âI was very conscious that by having all these tests I could
have been wasting NHS resources to satisfy my own conviction that I had Covid,"" she adds. âI felt like I was being unnecessarily neurotic.â But when her son tested positive on private PCR testing
equipment owned by his school, it was âblindingly obvious we all had Covid"", she says. Helen feels the situation is particularly unfair to
school children. âIf children test negative on PCR then schools have to take
children back,"" she says. âSo you probably have many more cases in school than they
are expected to deal with.â âI feel we have been short changed â particularly the
children â because testing is not working as it should be,"" she adds. ""My concern is it is leading not just the spread of the virus
but is eroding trust in the testing system.â Dr Harries is asked about a suggestion that officials in Wales - where some of the false results were - heard last week that there might be a problem with testing facilities. In response, she says it was ""very difficult to pinpoint exactly where it was"". ""We have been doing some really detailed investigations looking at the routes of travel of samples and of the types of samples, where they come from and who has been infected,"" she says. ""And obviously as soon as we got that information we worked with colleagues in Wales as well as other parts of the country."" She insists that ""the vast majority of tests throughout the UK have just been processed accurately and normally"". Wolverhampton Science Park, where the Immensa Health laboratory is based Dr Harries, who is also head of the UK Health Security Agency, says there will be ""a serious incident investigation"" within the organisation. ""I want to make sure if there are any further problems with other laboratories we can absolutely spot them as quickly as possible, so I will be conducting a serious incident investigation within the Health Security Agency to make sure we can mitigate any problems going forward,"" she says. She adds that the ""location of the laboratory combined with the geography and the time period"" of cases were key in allowing officials to spot the problem. Asked when officials first became aware of the issue, Dr Harries says there had been ""some feedback and some queries coming through over the last two or three weeks"" from public health directors in local communities. ""But itâs only in the last few days when we have dug right down into both the geography and the different type of tests coming back through and the different prevalence rates thatâs allowed us to pinpoint exactly what it is,"" she says. ""About half of these  cases are coming from the South West and that has allowed us to locate the laboratory."" Dr Harries says that anyone affected by the issue at the private laboratory in Wolverhampton will be contacted by NHS Test and Trace, with those whose tests have been processed in the past 10 days made a priority because they could still be infectious. ""We will be contacting by text message, by email... and will recommend they have another test,"" she says. But anyone whose tests were processed before then will still be contacted, she adds, because ""we clearly want to acknowledge that there has been a problem with that lab and just let them know"". Dr Harries adds that only a few thousand out of the 43,000 people affected by the wrong result could potentially be infectious now. âThe period of real infectivity is probably only reaching back about six or seven daysâ¦ so I think it will only be a few thousand people who will have positive tests in that total number,"" she says. ""It is very difficult to estimate. So we are obviously being cautious and just sending a message to all of them."" Dr Jenny Harries, the head of NHS Test and Trace, says it is ""not clear yet"" what went wrong in the private laboratory in Wolverhampton that has stopped operating due to fears people were given the wrong test results. She insists, however, that the ""rest of the system is working as normal"". Harries says that the laboratory is ""accredited to all of the appropriate standards"". It had been brought in to deal with an increase in surge testing from 8 September, and was also used during the surge in cases last winter. ""We are doing a detailed investigation with them, working on the actual processes within the laboratory â but the important thing of course is that we have suspended all of their services,"" she says. ""As soon as we establish what the problem is, then clearly we will have to look at that in detail. We will definitely not be using them until all of those processes are clear."" Covid-19 is continuing to spread around the world. The US, India and Brazil have seen the highest number of confirmed cases since the start of the pandemic, followed by the UK, Russia and Turkey. There have now been around 240 million confirmed cases since the start of the pandemic. Here's how that number has grown over time. The number of daily cases is stable or falling in most regions, except Europe.  China and India have given out the most vaccine doses, followed by the US. But when breaking the figures down by doses per 100 people in countries with a population of at least one million, Cuba, the United Arab Emirates and Uruguay top the list. Covid infections in England and Wales increased in the week to 9 October, according to the latest ONS estimates. Estimated infections were little changed in Northern Ireland but decreased in Scotland. The number of people with coronavirus for each nation is estimated to be: Just over one million people in the UK are estimated to have had Covid in the week to 9 October - the highest figure since the end of January, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). This is 1.5% of the population â or one in 65 people â up from one in 70 the previous week. The ONS survey is based on testing a random sample of people from private households. More than 20% of women admitted to intensive care for Covid-19 in Scotland since May 2021 were pregnant or had recently given birth, a study has found. A Scottish Intensive Care Audit Group report says 42 had been admitted since 18 May 2021, compared with 25 in the first two waves of the pandemic. The number has gone up despite overall intensive care numbers reducing. The Scottish government says vaccines are the best way to protect against the risks of Covid in pregnancy. Dr Stock, who is co-leadinga separate study into Covid-19 in pregnancy at the University of Edinburgh,external, tells BBC Scotland there is ""really strong evidence"" that pregnant women are more likely than other women to be admitted to hospital and intensive care. ""We also know that although we've had no deaths in Scotland yet, data from around the world and in particular the United States has shown higher mortality rates with Covid-19 in pregnancy than in non-pregnant women,"" she says.

Ted McSweeney says he has ""completely lost trust in the whole system"" after he received three negative PCR results at a testing site in Swindon, despite getting positive results from lateral flow tests. He only tested positive with a PCR test after using a home testing kit. After his first negative PCR result, Ted says he called NHS Test and Trace to ask for advice. ""They were happy for me to go back to work. But I had symptoms and I had a positive lateral flow test and said 'somethingâs not right here', so I booked another test,"" he says. He continued getting PCR tests for six days, but all came back negative. At this stage he had decided to isolate anyway, because he was ""sure"" he had the virus. After the third negative PCR, he contacted Test and Trace and was sent a home testing kit - that came back positive. He adds that he was then given conflicting information about when he could go back to work. ""Itâs made me lose faith in the whole system,"" he says. ""If they donât know, how do we know?"" In a statement, Wales' Health Minister Eluned Morgan says her government was made aware last week of the UK Health Security Agency's investigation into higher than expected numbers of positive lateral flow tests followed by negative PCR results. She says the issue is isolated to a private laboratory in Wolverhampton and does not involve the wider network, including the IP5 laboratory in Newport that processes the majority of
Welsh samples. Anyone
who had a test from 4 October and received a result from the affected
laboratory will be contacted by NHS Test and Trace and advised to get another test if their initial PCR result was negative. Close contacts who have symptoms will also be advised to book another test. People
who had a test processed at the laboratory between 8 September and 4 October
will also be contacted and advised to get a test if they have symptoms. The majority of those affected by the issue are in south-west England but some people in south-east England and an estimated 4,000 people in Wales may have been impacted. You can read more about the situation in Wales here. An estimated 4,000 Welsh residents may have been given inaccurate PCR results by the private laboratory in Wolverhampton, where NHS Test and Trace has suspended testing operations. In a statement, the Welsh government says the
majority of these tests would have been taken at testing sites across the Gwent
and Cwm Taf Morgannwg areas. If you receive a negative PCR test after a positive lateral flow result - and have not been contacted by NHS Test and Trace to say this may have been a false negative - the UK Health Security Agency says its advice remains the same as previously. It confirms to the BBC that individuals do not need to self-isolate in this case. It says anyone with Covid symptoms should book a PCR test and those with a positive lateral flow result should get a follow-up PCR test to confirm this. We've been speaking to more people who fear they may have been affected by false negative PCR test results. Graham Loader, from Newbury, believes his family are among those to receive incorrect results from the Newbury Showground testing site in West Berkshire. The council says the lab issue may affect those who took a PCR test at the site between 3 and 12 October. Three members of his family all had negative PCR results after positive lateral flow results in late September and early October. His 11-year-old son received a negative PCR result on 30 September, while his wife received a negative result on 1 October and he got one on 6 October. As a result, he tells the BBC he ""strongly suspects"" the dates given by the council are wrong. While his son didn't have any symptoms, Graham and his wife suffered tiredness and headaches. However, as they were not experiencing any of the three main Covid symptoms - a high temperature, continuous cough or change to their sense of smell or taste - they assumed the lateral flow tests must have been faulty. ""After getting the PCRs back weâve gone about our usual
business,"" Graham says. ""I completely trusted the PCR so I feel bad for all the
people Iâve been in contact with."" Meanwhile, away from the UK, vaccinated Australian citizens and the parents of residents will be able to visit Sydney from 1 November without the need to quarantine. Australia's borders have effectively been closed since March 2020, making it difficult even for citizens to enter. ""We are not opening up to everyone coming back to Australia at the moment,"" Prime Minister Scott Morrison says. He explains that priority will be given to Australians and family members, after which the nation will consider migrants, those with work and study visas and the ""challenge"" of tourists.

The page was written by George Bowden, Jennifer Meierhans, Katy Lewis, Kate Whannel and Mariam Issimdar. It was edited by Alex Kleiderman, Emma Atkinson and Owen Amos. The mood in Leigh-on-Sea tonight is sombre as people express their sadness and bewilderment at the fatal stabbing of their MP. Sir David Amess's constituents speak warmly ofa man who dedicated his life to serving them. Prime Minister Boris Johnson calls Sir David one of the ""kindest, nicest, most gentle people in politics"". And deputy PM Dominic Rabb says he was ""a formidable campaigner with a big heart, and tremendous generosity of spirit - including towards those he disagreed with"". A fixture in the House of Commons chamber for nearly 40 years he was known as one of Parliament's characters: fun, friendly, unconventional and outspoken. He always took his work seriously, but himself rarely. Here's what we know so far about the investigation into the fatal stabbing of Essex MP Sir David Amess.  We've got more detail on what we know about the investigation so farhere.  Lord
Walney, independent adviser to the government on political violence and disruption, says he can imagine a discreet police presence at constituency
events would be an attractive option for many MPs. The former Labour MP told BBC Radio 4's PM programme: âIt is not
simply the awful tragic violent act that took the life of David Amess and my
friend Jo Cox. ""It is also that sense of intimidation, if that prevents people
coming into parliament in future, and puts pressure on people to act
differently or step down that in itself is a huge attack on our democracy and
itâs something that we must be concerned about and take serious steps to
address.â Asked if he will make any recommendations for security measures
to ensure MPs physical safety, Walney says he thinks we will see the
Speaker of the House of Commons stepping up the levels of security. A Labour MP has
expressed caution over the idea that constituency surgeries should be observed
by police officers for protection, following the death of Sir David. Diane Abbott,
who served as Shadow Home Secretary under Jeremy Corbyn, says it could risk putting people off from visiting their local MP. Speaking to
Caroline Wyatt on BBC Radio 4 PM, she says: ""Iâve been talking to colleagues - there was one in North London who
was telling me that because of death threats she had a police officer outside
her advice session - and a police car in fact. Well of course the number of
people coming to see her dropped right down. ""You donât want to have a set-up
which is so off putting to ordinary people that just want help. So I wouldnât
support airport-style screening. âI would prefer, going forward, to meet constituents behind a screen, as we have now for Covid
and so on - that might be quite complicated to arrange but at least you know
someoneâs not going to just lean over the desk and stab you, which could happen
now.â People in Southend came together this afternoon at the town's Civic Centre to hold a vigil and reflect on the life of the MP David Amess and light candles. As tributes continue to pour in for Essex MP Sir David Amess let's take stock of what's happened since he was killed while meeting constituents in Leigh-on-Sea yesterday. Labour MP Naz Shah says there is ""no right or wrong answer"" over whether or not MPs should continue holding their surgeries. The Bradford West MP - who has received death threats in the past - says the attack on Sir David ""could have happened to any of us"". ""I just think you've got to respect every MP - some will have the 'Yes, we're going to carry on' view, and some people won't feel comfortable."" The West Papua independence leader Benny Wendahas sent,externalhis condolences to the family of Sir David Amess. He says he was one of the first MPs to sign the Westminster Declaration for West Papua and would ""always be fondly remembered by West Papuans"". The Westminster Declaration calls for an internationally supervised vote on independence from Indonesia for West Papua and has been signed by parliamentarians around the world.

The killing of MP Sir David Amess has highlighted a security dilemma forpoliticians across the globe. Some of the BBC's international correspondents explain what the situation is like in other countries. BBC South American correspondent Katy Watson says being an open, accessible people's representative in the major cities of Brazil - Sao Paolo and Rio de Janeiro - where wealth and inequalities are polarised, politicians are more likely to be flanked by bodyguards. Brazil is deeply divided politically and President Jair Bolsonaro was stabbed during his leadership campaign. Being an MP in India - the world's largest democracy - comes with a lot of privileges, a security detail is one of them, writes Vikas Pandey in Delhi. In recent years, attacks on politicians have taken the form of ink-throwing and slapping. But a number of politicians, including former PMs Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi, have lost their lives in violent attacks. In the Netherlands, Dutch lawmakers do not hold surgeries and only a select few Dutch politicians, including the anti-Islam leader, Geert Wilders, have protection. The prime minister, Mark Rutte, pictured below, has been seen cycling to meetings. Read the full story on the struggle politicians face to meet the public and stay safe. People have come together at Southend Civic Centre for a moment of reflection on Sir David's life. Mohammed Shamsuddin says he had known Sir David since 1983 and describes him as ""English gentleman who was so kind to our community as well as the whole of Southend"". Ruhul Shamsuddin, Joint Secretary of Essex Jamme Masjid says he had known Sir David since he was a child. He says: ""For his life to be cut short is devastating."" Mahmudul Hasan says: ""We greatly miss him and he will be always missed."" Claire Calder from the Dogs Trust says Sir David Amess was ""one of the biggest champions of animal welfare in Parliament"". She praises the MP's ""huge sense of humour"" and ""huge heart"". Recently, she says he had joined their campaigns to tackle puppy smuggling and to ban electric shock collars. Next week is the annual Westminster dog of the year contest run by the Dogs Trust and the Kennel Club. Sir David had been planning to enter his French bulldog into the contest. Allow Twitter content?

The fuel poverty charity National Energy Action describes Sir David as ""a true public servant"". The charity said the MP would be remembered for his bill aimed at eliminating fuel poverty - the Warm Homes and Energy Conservation Bill. The bill required the government to publish and implement a strategy to reduce fuel poverty and became law in 2000. A spokesperson for the NEA said Sir David's family could ""take some small comfort from knowing the huge positive difference he has made"". ""Millions of people across the UK are now better supported through national policies and programmes than before he started his campaign and he has directly helped millions of people to be warmer and safer in their homes."" London Mayor Sadiq Khan says his thoughts are with Sir David Amess' family at ""this time of unimaginable grief"". He describes the Essex MP as ""a brilliant, kind, dedicated public
servant, widely liked and respected across the political divide"". He adds: ""Iâm utterly disgusted
by this attack on our democracy. âLike with the murder of my dear friend Jo Cox five years ago, it appears that the horrific killing of Sir David Amess was another attempt to divide us, to fuel fear and to change how we treat one another."" ""Our response must be to stand united in defiance and stay true to our values and way of life.""  We've been reporting that some MPs are holding their usual surgeries in their constituencies following the death of Sir David Amess. Among them is Craig Williams, MP for Montgomeryshire, who met voters alongside his Conservative colleague from the Welsh Parliament, Russell George. Allow Twitter content?

Kieran Mullan, the Tory MP for Crewe and Nantwich,tweeted:,external""Surgery today, we must not let people force us to do things differently. David would not have wanted that."" Dominic CascianiHome Affairs Correspondent There's no indication that the national terrorism threat level is going to be changed to a higher level in light of the attack. The threat level is currently ""substantial"" which is in the middle of the five tiers. It means the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre, which is part of MI5, thinks that an attack is ""likely"". It's been at that level since February. The two levels above it are typically triggered when there are ongoing concerns among counter terrorism leaders of an emerging plot or remaining questions about an incident that's already taken place. Members of Southend-On-Seaâs Muslim communities are paying tribute to Sir David Amess as a community leader, friend and mentor. A joint statement from all the mosques in the town says: ""He shared in our happiness, by attending our weddings and functions and he was there for us in our times of need.  We will all miss him dearly, but his legacy of public service will live on, as will memories of his warmth, selflessness and kindness."" It says: ""Sir Davidâs murder was an indefensible atrocity, commited on the grounds of a place of worship and we condemn it in the strongest possible terms.This act was committed in the name of blind hatred, and we look forward to the perpetrator being brought to justice."" Ruhul Shamsuddin, joint secretary of Essex Jamme Masjid
remembers Sir David as ""a tremendous force for good"" and ""a truly
wonderful man"". ""Itâs an honour to say Iâve known him my whole life. Iâve lost not just a community leader, but a
family friend and mentor.â President of Ireland, Michael D Higgins, has sent his condolences to Sir David's family. He said he was killed while carrying out a fundamental role of a politician - helping their constituents. He offered his ""deepest sympathies to the family, friends, colleagues in Parliament and constituents"" of Sir David. He also extended thoughts to the family of the late Jo Cox MP, murdered just over five years ago in her constituency of Batley and Spen. ""On behalf of the Irish people, I send them our deepest sympathies."" TheBritish-Irish Parliamentary Assembly,external(BIPA) has cancelled a scheduled plenary meeting at Westminster on Monday as a mark of respect for Sir David. The British Committee for Iran Freedom (BCFIF) has issued a statement condemning the ""vicious attack, which was an assault not only on Sir David, but also on democracy in the UK"". Sir David was a champion of human rights and democracy in Iran for more than three decades. He consistently  spoke in support of the Iranian peopleâs democratic aspirations and the Iranian Resistance movement, NCRI, theBCFIF,externalsaid. ""One of the proudest things I have ever done in my political career is to support the National Council of Resistance of Iran which calls for the Iranian regime to be replaced with a safer and more democratic government,"" Sir David said on 6 September. In an email to the BBC, supporter Jahed Madumi wrote: ""With great sorrow I
heard about Sir David Amess' loss. ""As an Iranian I have to say that he was a
great friend of our nation, and he always defended the freedom for the people

Cross-border meeting off as Poots fails to show up,"The North-South Ministerial Council (NSMC) was cancelled earlier after Edwin Poots failed to turn up A Belfast businessman is to seek a court order aimed at forcing the Democratic Unionist Party to end its boycott of of most cross-border ministerial meetings. On Monday, the High Court ruledthe DUP's boycott was ""unlawful"". But on Friday two ministerial meetings were cancelled after the DUP's Edwin Poots failed to show. Businessman Sean Napier said he was seeking the court order as a ""guardian of the Good Friday Agreement"". Mr Napier, who mounted the High Court challenge earlier this week, said the agreement was not an ""a la carte"" treaty. ""It has been there for us, it has kept peace here and it's imperative it is properly implemented in all its parts,"" he said. Mr Napier said the Good Friday Agreement was not an ""a la carte"" treaty Mr Napier added: ""It is very important in what it has done for the greater good of the people here. I think it is my duty to be its guardian."" DUP First Minister Paul Givan said no meetings were planned for Friday as he had not agreed the agendas. Northern Ireland's Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon and the Republic of Ireland's environment minister logged on, but her DUP ministerial colleague Edwin Poots did not. He was also a no show in a meeting with Junior Minister Declan Kearney and Irish Minister Darragh O'Brien. Mr Napier's solicitor Paul Farrell said the DUP must explain their position the ministerial meetings. ""I don't understand that a meeting that takes place today with accompanying ministers is not a meeting,"" he said. ""I think whatever we receive next week by way of response from DUP ministers will have to explain that. I cannot understand when a meeting is not a meeting."" Givan defends DUP boycott of north-south meetings DUP boycott of north-south meetings 'unlawful' The DUP boycott of most North-South Ministerial Council (NSMC) meetings wasannounced by party leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldsonlast month. The NSMC is the main body for cross-border co-operation between the governments of Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. It is attended by ministers from both sides of the border who oversee joint working in areas such as trade, food safety and agriculture. The DUP is refusing to attend in protest againstthe Northern Ireland Protocol. The protocol is part of the Brexit deal agreed in 2019 and was introduced to help prevent checks along the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. But unionists say it creates a barrier to trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and undermines the latter's position in the UK. Ms Mallon says the boycott must end The NI minister Ms Mallon said the boycott must end. She had been due to discuss cross-border aquaculture with her counterparts. ""It is astounding following this week's High Court ruling that Jeffrey Donaldson is overseeing a deliberate and unlawful boycott of the north-south institutions,"" she said. ""It shows only disdain for the rule of law but utter contempt for the people we represent."" On Thursday, ministers attended a NSMC meeting on health issues. TheDUP said this was in line with its position. Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, DUP leader, says the party's position ""remains as it has been"" When asked on Thursday whether the DUP would continue its boycott, Sir Jeffrey told BBC Radio Foyle ""our position remains as it has been"". Sinn FÃ©in junior minister Declan Kearney said that ""this inaction by Minister Edwin Poots and the executive office is a serious failure to comply with the law and the ministerial code which require ministers to participate in meetings of the NSMC"". He added: ""These institutions are about joining up services across the island and delivering on important issues which impact on people's lives such as health, education and millions of pounds in funding.Â ""It's time the DUP put ordinary people's interests first by ending this illegal boycott of vital government business and get back to work on behalf of everyone in our society.""

Serious incident investigation after wrong Covid results,"NHS Test and Trace suspends Covid testing provided by a private laboratory in Wolverhampton amid fears up to 43,000 people were given the wrong result Dr Jenny Harries, the head of NHS Test and Trace, says it is not yet clear how or why the laboratory might have given incorrect results Harries adds there will be a ""serious incident investigation"" to ensure there are not problems at other testing laboratories Earlier, a mass testing site in Berkshire asked people who recently got a negative result to book another test It comes after reports that some people received negative PCR tests after testing positive using lateral flow devices But health officials say the problem is ""an isolated incident attributed to one laboratory"" and that they are investigating the cause Separately, travellers returning to England will be able to take cheaper lateral flow tests from 24 October Edited by Hamish Mackay We're bringing our live coverage to a close now, so here's a reminder of the main stories today: We'll be back on Monday with all the latest coronavirus news. In the meantime you can follow our main storyhereorvisit our front pagefor other news. Today's posts were written by Becky Morton and Hazel Shearing and edited by Hamish Mackay. The Scottish governmenthas requested military back-up for two NHS health boardsto relieve pressure ahead of the winter period. NHS Lanarkshire will receive three nurses, 45 medics, 12 general troops and three drivers, while 14 medics, two nurses and four additional personnel will be sent to NHS Borders. Both health boards have already halted all non-urgent procedures, blaming staff shortages and rising patient demand. It comes after soldiers were brought in tosupport the Scottish Ambulance Servicein September. A previously ""active"" and ""energetic"" GP has told the BBC she now has to use a wheelchair due to long Covid. Susannah Thompson, from Blyth, contracted coronavirus last year while working on the NHS frontline, and has since experienced long-lasting symptoms of the virus. The 41-year-old says she struggles to get out of bed and complete day-to-day tasks, but decided to start using a wheelchair to ""regain her independence"" and help others. This video can not be played Coronavirus: Blyth GP using wheelchair due to long Covid Prof Alan McNally, a microbiologist at the University of Birmingham, says he is ""astonished"" by the problems at the private laboratory in Wolverhampton and says they will be the result of ""appropriate controls not being used"". He tells the BBC he ""can't understand how itâs happened at this scale"". âIf you do that test properly with all appropriate controls then there is no way you should have missed sheer volume of false negative results we are talking about here,"" he says. âYou should see if you have this level of systematic failure."" He says it is a question of ""quality control and quality assurance, oversight and management"", adding: ""I cannot fathom the failings that would lead to this level of false negative results."" Boris Johnson was visiting a Rolls Royce factory in Bristol The prime minister says people should not be concerned after thousands may wrongly have been told their Covid tests were negativebecause of errors at a private lab. âWeâre looking into what went wrong with that particular testing centre, but is doesnât affect the overall numbers,"" Boris Johnson says. On a visit to Bristol, he tells reporters: ""Overall, the picture in the South West in the Bristol area and the rest of the country, remains very much where it has been for some time now. We are just getting along in a state of, more or less, an equilibrium."" He says that while there are quite high infection rates, particularly in young people ""that isn't really feeding through into the older generations in the way that we saw in previous spikes"". âThereâs no doubt that the wall of vaccination that the country has built is very high and very effective,"" he adds. He says the overall data shows the government is right to stick with its ""plan A"" for winter - meaning no additional restrictions are needed.  Helen Diggle, who lives in Tellisford in Somerset, says she
had five positive lateral flow tests and three negative PCRs before finally
testing positive for Covid on a PCR test. On one of her visits to a testing centre she said a member
of staff told her she had seen lots of very similar cases recently,
particularly involving local schools. Helen tells BBC News: âIt is really worrying that some
people in the system, people on the ground, have been aware that something is
going on.â When Helen and her 10-year-old daughter kept testing negative on PCRs despite high temperatures and positive lateral flow tests
she knew something was not right. âI was very conscious that by having all these tests I could
have been wasting NHS resources to satisfy my own conviction that I had Covid,"" she adds. âI felt like I was being unnecessarily neurotic.â But when her son tested positive on private PCR testing
equipment owned by his school, it was âblindingly obvious we all had Covid"", she says. Helen feels the situation is particularly unfair to
school children. âIf children test negative on PCR then schools have to take
children back,"" she says. âSo you probably have many more cases in school than they
are expected to deal with.â âI feel we have been short changed â particularly the
children â because testing is not working as it should be,"" she adds. ""My concern is it is leading not just the spread of the virus
but is eroding trust in the testing system.â Dr Harries is asked about a suggestion that officials in Wales - where some of the false results were - heard last week that there might be a problem with testing facilities. In response, she says it was ""very difficult to pinpoint exactly where it was"". ""We have been doing some really detailed investigations looking at the routes of travel of samples and of the types of samples, where they come from and who has been infected,"" she says. ""And obviously as soon as we got that information we worked with colleagues in Wales as well as other parts of the country."" She insists that ""the vast majority of tests throughout the UK have just been processed accurately and normally"". Wolverhampton Science Park, where the Immensa Health laboratory is based Dr Harries, who is also head of the UK Health Security Agency, says there will be ""a serious incident investigation"" within the organisation. ""I want to make sure if there are any further problems with other laboratories we can absolutely spot them as quickly as possible, so I will be conducting a serious incident investigation within the Health Security Agency to make sure we can mitigate any problems going forward,"" she says. She adds that the ""location of the laboratory combined with the geography and the time period"" of cases were key in allowing officials to spot the problem. Asked when officials first became aware of the issue, Dr Harries says there had been ""some feedback and some queries coming through over the last two or three weeks"" from public health directors in local communities. ""But itâs only in the last few days when we have dug right down into both the geography and the different type of tests coming back through and the different prevalence rates thatâs allowed us to pinpoint exactly what it is,"" she says. ""About half of these  cases are coming from the South West and that has allowed us to locate the laboratory."" Dr Harries says that anyone affected by the issue at the private laboratory in Wolverhampton will be contacted by NHS Test and Trace, with those whose tests have been processed in the past 10 days made a priority because they could still be infectious. ""We will be contacting by text message, by email... and will recommend they have another test,"" she says. But anyone whose tests were processed before then will still be contacted, she adds, because ""we clearly want to acknowledge that there has been a problem with that lab and just let them know"". Dr Harries adds that only a few thousand out of the 43,000 people affected by the wrong result could potentially be infectious now. âThe period of real infectivity is probably only reaching back about six or seven daysâ¦ so I think it will only be a few thousand people who will have positive tests in that total number,"" she says. ""It is very difficult to estimate. So we are obviously being cautious and just sending a message to all of them."" Dr Jenny Harries, the head of NHS Test and Trace, says it is ""not clear yet"" what went wrong in the private laboratory in Wolverhampton that has stopped operating due to fears people were given the wrong test results. She insists, however, that the ""rest of the system is working as normal"". Harries says that the laboratory is ""accredited to all of the appropriate standards"". It had been brought in to deal with an increase in surge testing from 8 September, and was also used during the surge in cases last winter. ""We are doing a detailed investigation with them, working on the actual processes within the laboratory â but the important thing of course is that we have suspended all of their services,"" she says. ""As soon as we establish what the problem is, then clearly we will have to look at that in detail. We will definitely not be using them until all of those processes are clear."" Covid-19 is continuing to spread around the world. The US, India and Brazil have seen the highest number of confirmed cases since the start of the pandemic, followed by the UK, Russia and Turkey. There have now been around 240 million confirmed cases since the start of the pandemic. Here's how that number has grown over time. The number of daily cases is stable or falling in most regions, except Europe.  China and India have given out the most vaccine doses, followed by the US. But when breaking the figures down by doses per 100 people in countries with a population of at least one million, Cuba, the United Arab Emirates and Uruguay top the list. Covid infections in England and Wales increased in the week to 9 October, according to the latest ONS estimates. Estimated infections were little changed in Northern Ireland but decreased in Scotland. The number of people with coronavirus for each nation is estimated to be: Just over one million people in the UK are estimated to have had Covid in the week to 9 October - the highest figure since the end of January, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). This is 1.5% of the population â or one in 65 people â up from one in 70 the previous week. The ONS survey is based on testing a random sample of people from private households. More than 20% of women admitted to intensive care for Covid-19 in Scotland since May 2021 were pregnant or had recently given birth, a study has found. A Scottish Intensive Care Audit Group report says 42 had been admitted since 18 May 2021, compared with 25 in the first two waves of the pandemic. The number has gone up despite overall intensive care numbers reducing. The Scottish government says vaccines are the best way to protect against the risks of Covid in pregnancy. Dr Stock, who is co-leadinga separate study into Covid-19 in pregnancy at the University of Edinburgh,external, tells BBC Scotland there is ""really strong evidence"" that pregnant women are more likely than other women to be admitted to hospital and intensive care. ""We also know that although we've had no deaths in Scotland yet, data from around the world and in particular the United States has shown higher mortality rates with Covid-19 in pregnancy than in non-pregnant women,"" she says. You can read more about the report here. Ted McSweeney says he has ""completely lost trust in the whole system"" after he received three negative PCR results at a testing site in Swindon, despite getting positive results from lateral flow tests. He only tested positive with a PCR test after using a home testing kit. After his first negative PCR result, Ted says he called NHS Test and Trace to ask for advice. ""They were happy for me to go back to work. But I had symptoms and I had a positive lateral flow test and said 'somethingâs not right here', so I booked another test,"" he says. He continued getting PCR tests for six days, but all came back negative. At this stage he had decided to isolate anyway, because he was ""sure"" he had the virus. After the third negative PCR, he contacted Test and Trace and was sent a home testing kit - that came back positive. He adds that he was then given conflicting information about when he could go back to work. ""Itâs made me lose faith in the whole system,"" he says. ""If they donât know, how do we know?"" In a statement, Wales' Health Minister Eluned Morgan says her government was made aware last week of the UK Health Security Agency's investigation into higher than expected numbers of positive lateral flow tests followed by negative PCR results. She says the issue is isolated to a private laboratory in Wolverhampton and does not involve the wider network, including the IP5 laboratory in Newport that processes the majority of
Welsh samples. Anyone
who had a test from 4 October and received a result from the affected
laboratory will be contacted by NHS Test and Trace and advised to get another test if their initial PCR result was negative. Close contacts who have symptoms will also be advised to book another test. People
who had a test processed at the laboratory between 8 September and 4 October
will also be contacted and advised to get a test if they have symptoms. The majority of those affected by the issue are in south-west England but some people in south-east England and an estimated 4,000 people in Wales may have been impacted. You can read more about the situation in Wales here. An estimated 4,000 Welsh residents may have been given inaccurate PCR results by the private laboratory in Wolverhampton, where NHS Test and Trace has suspended testing operations. In a statement, the Welsh government says the
majority of these tests would have been taken at testing sites across the Gwent
and Cwm Taf Morgannwg areas. If you receive a negative PCR test after a positive lateral flow result - and have not been contacted by NHS Test and Trace to say this may have been a false negative - the UK Health Security Agency says its advice remains the same as previously. It confirms to the BBC that individuals do not need to self-isolate in this case. It says anyone with Covid symptoms should book a PCR test and those with a positive lateral flow result should get a follow-up PCR test to confirm this. We've been speaking to more people who fear they may have been affected by false negative PCR test results. Graham Loader, from Newbury, believes his family are among those to receive incorrect results from the Newbury Showground testing site in West Berkshire. The council says the lab issue may affect those who took a PCR test at the site between 3 and 12 October. Three members of his family all had negative PCR results after positive lateral flow results in late September and early October. His 11-year-old son received a negative PCR result on 30 September, while his wife received a negative result on 1 October and he got one on 6 October. As a result, he tells the BBC he ""strongly suspects"" the dates given by the council are wrong. While his son didn't have any symptoms, Graham and his wife suffered tiredness and headaches. However, as they were not experiencing any of the three main Covid symptoms - a high temperature, continuous cough or change to their sense of smell or taste - they assumed the lateral flow tests must have been faulty. ""After getting the PCRs back weâve gone about our usual
business,"" Graham says. ""I completely trusted the PCR so I feel bad for all the
people Iâve been in contact with."" Meanwhile, away from the UK, vaccinated Australian citizens and the parents of residents will be able to visit Sydney from 1 November without the need to quarantine. Australia's borders have effectively been closed since March 2020, making it difficult even for citizens to enter. ""We are not opening up to everyone coming back to Australia at the moment,"" Prime Minister Scott Morrison says. He explains that priority will be given to Australians and family members, after which the nation will consider migrants, those with work and study visas and the ""challenge"" of tourists.

Latest after MP stabbed at constituency surgery,"Police say they are treating the killing of MP Sir David Amess as a terrorist incident There is a potential link to Islamist extremism, and counter-terrorism officers are searching two addresses in the London area The Conservative MP was stabbed multiple times in the attack in Leigh-on-Sea, Essex, on Friday Boris Johnson and the Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer have laid flowers at the scene Home Secretary Priti Patel says Sir David was killed doing a job he loved Ms Patel, who also has an Essex constituency, calls Sir David a ""dear and loyal friend"" A 25-year-old British man is being held in police custody on suspicion of murder Government sources tell the BBC he is a UK national who, from initial inquiries, appears to be of Somali heritage Edited by Emma Atkinson We are bringing our live updates on the killing of Essex MP Sir David Amess to a close for the evening. The page was written by George Bowden, Jennifer Meierhans, Katy Lewis, Kate Whannel and Mariam Issimdar. It was edited by Alex Kleiderman, Emma Atkinson and Owen Amos. The mood in Leigh-on-Sea tonight is sombre as people express their sadness and bewilderment at the fatal stabbing of their MP. Sir David Amess's constituents speak warmly ofa man who dedicated his life to serving them. Prime Minister Boris Johnson calls Sir David one of the ""kindest, nicest, most gentle people in politics"". And deputy PM Dominic Rabb says he was ""a formidable campaigner with a big heart, and tremendous generosity of spirit - including towards those he disagreed with"". A fixture in the House of Commons chamber for nearly 40 years he was known as one of Parliament's characters: fun, friendly, unconventional and outspoken. He always took his work seriously, but himself rarely. Here's what we know so far about the investigation into the fatal stabbing of Essex MP Sir David Amess.  We've got more detail on what we know about the investigation so farhere.  Lord
Walney, independent adviser to the government on political violence and disruption, says he can imagine a discreet police presence at constituency
events would be an attractive option for many MPs. The former Labour MP told BBC Radio 4's PM programme: âIt is not
simply the awful tragic violent act that took the life of David Amess and my
friend Jo Cox. ""It is also that sense of intimidation, if that prevents people
coming into parliament in future, and puts pressure on people to act
differently or step down that in itself is a huge attack on our democracy and
itâs something that we must be concerned about and take serious steps to
address.â Asked if he will make any recommendations for security measures
to ensure MPs physical safety, Walney says he thinks we will see the
Speaker of the House of Commons stepping up the levels of security. A Labour MP has
expressed caution over the idea that constituency surgeries should be observed
by police officers for protection, following the death of Sir David. Diane Abbott,
who served as Shadow Home Secretary under Jeremy Corbyn, says it could risk putting people off from visiting their local MP. Speaking to
Caroline Wyatt on BBC Radio 4 PM, she says: ""Iâve been talking to colleagues - there was one in North London who
was telling me that because of death threats she had a police officer outside
her advice session - and a police car in fact. Well of course the number of
people coming to see her dropped right down. ""You donât want to have a set-up
which is so off putting to ordinary people that just want help. So I wouldnât
support airport-style screening. âI would prefer, going forward, to meet constituents behind a screen, as we have now for Covid
and so on - that might be quite complicated to arrange but at least you know
someoneâs not going to just lean over the desk and stab you, which could happen
now.â People in Southend came together this afternoon at the town's Civic Centre to hold a vigil and reflect on the life of the MP David Amess and light candles. As tributes continue to pour in for Essex MP Sir David Amess let's take stock of what's happened since he was killed while meeting constituents in Leigh-on-Sea yesterday. Labour MP Naz Shah says there is ""no right or wrong answer"" over whether or not MPs should continue holding their surgeries. The Bradford West MP - who has received death threats in the past - says the attack on Sir David ""could have happened to any of us"". ""I just think you've got to respect every MP - some will have the 'Yes, we're going to carry on' view, and some people won't feel comfortable."" The West Papua independence leader Benny Wendahas sent,externalhis condolences to the family of Sir David Amess. He says he was one of the first MPs to sign the Westminster Declaration for West Papua and would ""always be fondly remembered by West Papuans"". The Westminster Declaration calls for an internationally supervised vote on independence from Indonesia for West Papua and has been signed by parliamentarians around the world.

The killing of MP Sir David Amess has highlighted a security dilemma forpoliticians across the globe. Some of the BBC's international correspondents explain what the situation is like in other countries. BBC South American correspondent Katy Watson says being an open, accessible people's representative in the major cities of Brazil - Sao Paolo and Rio de Janeiro - where wealth and inequalities are polarised, politicians are more likely to be flanked by bodyguards. Brazil is deeply divided politically and President Jair Bolsonaro was stabbed during his leadership campaign. Being an MP in India - the world's largest democracy - comes with a lot of privileges, a security detail is one of them, writes Vikas Pandey in Delhi. In recent years, attacks on politicians have taken the form of ink-throwing and slapping. But a number of politicians, including former PMs Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi, have lost their lives in violent attacks. In the Netherlands, Dutch lawmakers do not hold surgeries and only a select few Dutch politicians, including the anti-Islam leader, Geert Wilders, have protection. The prime minister, Mark Rutte, pictured below, has been seen cycling to meetings. Read the full story on the struggle politicians face to meet the public and stay safe. People have come together at Southend Civic Centre for a moment of reflection on Sir David's life. Mohammed Shamsuddin says he had known Sir David since 1983 and describes him as ""English gentleman who was so kind to our community as well as the whole of Southend"". Ruhul Shamsuddin, Joint Secretary of Essex Jamme Masjid says he had known Sir David since he was a child. He says: ""For his life to be cut short is devastating."" Mahmudul Hasan says: ""We greatly miss him and he will be always missed."" Claire Calder from the Dogs Trust says Sir David Amess was ""one of the biggest champions of animal welfare in Parliament"". She praises the MP's ""huge sense of humour"" and ""huge heart"". Recently, she says he had joined their campaigns to tackle puppy smuggling and to ban electric shock collars. Next week is the annual Westminster dog of the year contest run by the Dogs Trust and the Kennel Club. Sir David had been planning to enter his French bulldog into the contest. Allow Twitter content?

The fuel poverty charity National Energy Action describes Sir David as ""a true public servant"". The charity said the MP would be remembered for his bill aimed at eliminating fuel poverty - the Warm Homes and Energy Conservation Bill. The bill required the government to publish and implement a strategy to reduce fuel poverty and became law in 2000. A spokesperson for the NEA said Sir David's family could ""take some small comfort from knowing the huge positive difference he has made"". ""Millions of people across the UK are now better supported through national policies and programmes than before he started his campaign and he has directly helped millions of people to be warmer and safer in their homes."" London Mayor Sadiq Khan says his thoughts are with Sir David Amess' family at ""this time of unimaginable grief"". He describes the Essex MP as ""a brilliant, kind, dedicated public
servant, widely liked and respected across the political divide"". He adds: ""Iâm utterly disgusted
by this attack on our democracy. âLike with the murder of my dear friend Jo Cox five years ago, it appears that the horrific killing of Sir David Amess was another attempt to divide us, to fuel fear and to change how we treat one another."" ""Our response must be to stand united in defiance and stay true to our values and way of life.""  We've been reporting that some MPs are holding their usual surgeries in their constituencies following the death of Sir David Amess. Among them is Craig Williams, MP for Montgomeryshire, who met voters alongside his Conservative colleague from the Welsh Parliament, Russell George. Allow Twitter content?

Kieran Mullan, the Tory MP for Crewe and Nantwich,tweeted:,external""Surgery today, we must not let people force us to do things differently. David would not have wanted that."" Dominic CascianiHome Affairs Correspondent There's no indication that the national terrorism threat level is going to be changed to a higher level in light of the attack. The threat level is currently ""substantial"" which is in the middle of the five tiers. It means the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre, which is part of MI5, thinks that an attack is ""likely"". It's been at that level since February. The two levels above it are typically triggered when there are ongoing concerns among counter terrorism leaders of an emerging plot or remaining questions about an incident that's already taken place. Members of Southend-On-Seaâs Muslim communities are paying tribute to Sir David Amess as a community leader, friend and mentor. A joint statement from all the mosques in the town says: ""He shared in our happiness, by attending our weddings and functions and he was there for us in our times of need.  We will all miss him dearly, but his legacy of public service will live on, as will memories of his warmth, selflessness and kindness."" It says: ""Sir Davidâs murder was an indefensible atrocity, commited on the grounds of a place of worship and we condemn it in the strongest possible terms.This act was committed in the name of blind hatred, and we look forward to the perpetrator being brought to justice."" Ruhul Shamsuddin, joint secretary of Essex Jamme Masjid
remembers Sir David as ""a tremendous force for good"" and ""a truly
wonderful man"". ""Itâs an honour to say Iâve known him my whole life. Iâve lost not just a community leader, but a
family friend and mentor.â President of Ireland, Michael D Higgins, has sent his condolences to Sir David's family. He said he was killed while carrying out a fundamental role of a politician - helping their constituents. He offered his ""deepest sympathies to the family, friends, colleagues in Parliament and constituents"" of Sir David. He also extended thoughts to the family of the late Jo Cox MP, murdered just over five years ago in her constituency of Batley and Spen. ""On behalf of the Irish people, I send them our deepest sympathies."" TheBritish-Irish Parliamentary Assembly,external(BIPA) has cancelled a scheduled plenary meeting at Westminster on Monday as a mark of respect for Sir David. The British Committee for Iran Freedom (BCFIF) has issued a statement condemning the ""vicious attack, which was an assault not only on Sir David, but also on democracy in the UK"". Sir David was a champion of human rights and democracy in Iran for more than three decades. He consistently  spoke in support of the Iranian peopleâs democratic aspirations and the Iranian Resistance movement, NCRI, theBCFIF,externalsaid. ""One of the proudest things I have ever done in my political career is to support the National Council of Resistance of Iran which calls for the Iranian regime to be replaced with a safer and more democratic government,"" Sir David said on 6 September. In an email to the BBC, supporter Jahed Madumi wrote: ""With great sorrow I
heard about Sir David Amess' loss. ""As an Iranian I have to say that he was a
great friend of our nation, and he always defended the freedom for the people

LiveLiveSerious incident investigation after wrong Covid resultsLess than a minute ago,"NHS Test and Trace suspends Covid testing provided by a private laboratory in Wolverhampton amid fears up to 43,000 people were given the wrong result Dr Jenny Harries, the head of NHS Test and Trace, says it is not yet clear how or why the laboratory might have given incorrect results Harries adds there will be a ""serious incident investigation"" to ensure there are not problems at other testing laboratories Earlier, a mass testing site in Berkshire asked people who recently got a negative result to book another test It comes after reports that some people received negative PCR tests after testing positive using lateral flow devices But health officials say the problem is ""an isolated incident attributed to one laboratory"" and that they are investigating the cause Separately, travellers returning to England will be able to take cheaper lateral flow tests from 24 October Edited by Hamish Mackay We're bringing our live coverage to a close now, so here's a reminder of the main stories today: We'll be back on Monday with all the latest coronavirus news. In the meantime you can follow our main storyhereorvisit our front pagefor other news. Today's posts were written by Becky Morton and Hazel Shearing and edited by Hamish Mackay. The Scottish governmenthas requested military back-up for two NHS health boardsto relieve pressure ahead of the winter period. NHS Lanarkshire will receive three nurses, 45 medics, 12 general troops and three drivers, while 14 medics, two nurses and four additional personnel will be sent to NHS Borders. Both health boards have already halted all non-urgent procedures, blaming staff shortages and rising patient demand. It comes after soldiers were brought in tosupport the Scottish Ambulance Servicein September. A previously ""active"" and ""energetic"" GP has told the BBC she now has to use a wheelchair due to long Covid. Susannah Thompson, from Blyth, contracted coronavirus last year while working on the NHS frontline, and has since experienced long-lasting symptoms of the virus. The 41-year-old says she struggles to get out of bed and complete day-to-day tasks, but decided to start using a wheelchair to ""regain her independence"" and help others. This video can not be played Coronavirus: Blyth GP using wheelchair due to long Covid Prof Alan McNally, a microbiologist at the University of Birmingham, says he is ""astonished"" by the problems at the private laboratory in Wolverhampton and says they will be the result of ""appropriate controls not being used"". He tells the BBC he ""can't understand how itâs happened at this scale"". âIf you do that test properly with all appropriate controls then there is no way you should have missed sheer volume of false negative results we are talking about here,"" he says. âYou should see if you have this level of systematic failure."" He says it is a question of ""quality control and quality assurance, oversight and management"", adding: ""I cannot fathom the failings that would lead to this level of false negative results."" Boris Johnson was visiting a Rolls Royce factory in Bristol The prime minister says people should not be concerned after thousands may wrongly have been told their Covid tests were negativebecause of errors at a private lab. âWeâre looking into what went wrong with that particular testing centre, but is doesnât affect the overall numbers,"" Boris Johnson says. On a visit to Bristol, he tells reporters: ""Overall, the picture in the South West in the Bristol area and the rest of the country, remains very much where it has been for some time now. We are just getting along in a state of, more or less, an equilibrium."" He says that while there are quite high infection rates, particularly in young people ""that isn't really feeding through into the older generations in the way that we saw in previous spikes"". âThereâs no doubt that the wall of vaccination that the country has built is very high and very effective,"" he adds. He says the overall data shows the government is right to stick with its ""plan A"" for winter - meaning no additional restrictions are needed.  Helen Diggle, who lives in Tellisford in Somerset, says she
had five positive lateral flow tests and three negative PCRs before finally
testing positive for Covid on a PCR test. On one of her visits to a testing centre she said a member
of staff told her she had seen lots of very similar cases recently,
particularly involving local schools. Helen tells BBC News: âIt is really worrying that some
people in the system, people on the ground, have been aware that something is
going on.â When Helen and her 10-year-old daughter kept testing negative on PCRs despite high temperatures and positive lateral flow tests
she knew something was not right. âI was very conscious that by having all these tests I could
have been wasting NHS resources to satisfy my own conviction that I had Covid,"" she adds. âI felt like I was being unnecessarily neurotic.â But when her son tested positive on private PCR testing
equipment owned by his school, it was âblindingly obvious we all had Covid"", she says. Helen feels the situation is particularly unfair to
school children. âIf children test negative on PCR then schools have to take
children back,"" she says. âSo you probably have many more cases in school than they
are expected to deal with.â âI feel we have been short changed â particularly the
children â because testing is not working as it should be,"" she adds. ""My concern is it is leading not just the spread of the virus
but is eroding trust in the testing system.â Dr Harries is asked about a suggestion that officials in Wales - where some of the false results were - heard last week that there might be a problem with testing facilities.

""We have been doing some really detailed investigations looking at the routes of travel of samples and of the types of samples, where they come from and who has been infected,"" she says. ""And obviously as soon as we got that information we worked with colleagues in Wales as well as other parts of the country."" She insists that ""the vast majority of tests throughout the UK have just been processed accurately and normally"". Wolverhampton Science Park, where the Immensa Health laboratory is based Dr Harries, who is also head of the UK Health Security Agency, says there will be ""a serious incident investigation"" within the organisation.

Dr Harries adds that only a few thousand out of the 43,000 people affected by the wrong result could potentially be infectious now. âThe period of real infectivity is probably only reaching back about six or seven daysâ¦ so I think it will only be a few thousand people who will have positive tests in that total number,"" she says. ""It is very difficult to estimate. So we are obviously being cautious and just sending a message to all of them."" Dr Jenny Harries, the head of NHS Test and Trace, says it is ""not clear yet"" what went wrong in the private laboratory in Wolverhampton that has stopped operating due to fears people were given the wrong test results. She insists, however, that the ""rest of the system is working as normal"". Harries says that the laboratory is ""accredited to all of the appropriate standards"". It had been brought in to deal with an increase in surge testing from 8 September, and was also used during the surge in cases last winter. ""We are doing a detailed investigation with them, working on the actual processes within the laboratory â but the important thing of course is that we have suspended all of their services,"" she says. ""As soon as we establish what the problem is, then clearly we will have to look at that in detail. We will definitely not be using them until all of those processes are clear."" Covid-19 is continuing to spread around the world. The US, India and Brazil have seen the highest number of confirmed cases since the start of the pandemic, followed by the UK, Russia and Turkey. There have now been around 240 million confirmed cases since the start of the pandemic. Here's how that number has grown over time. The number of daily cases is stable or falling in most regions, except Europe.  China and India have given out the most vaccine doses, followed by the US. But when breaking the figures down by doses per 100 people in countries with a population of at least one million, Cuba, the United Arab Emirates and Uruguay top the list. Covid infections in England and Wales increased in the week to 9 October, according to the latest ONS estimates. Estimated infections were little changed in Northern Ireland but decreased in Scotland. The number of people with coronavirus for each nation is estimated to be: Just over one million people in the UK are estimated to have had Covid in the week to 9 October - the highest figure since the end of January, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). This is 1.5% of the population â or one in 65 people â up from one in 70 the previous week. The ONS survey is based on testing a random sample of people from private households. More than 20% of women admitted to intensive care for Covid-19 in Scotland since May 2021 were pregnant or had recently given birth, a study has found. A Scottish Intensive Care Audit Group report says 42 had been admitted since 18 May 2021, compared with 25 in the first two waves of the pandemic. The number has gone up despite overall intensive care numbers reducing. The Scottish government says vaccines are the best way to protect against the risks of Covid in pregnancy. Dr Stock, who is co-leadinga separate study into Covid-19 in pregnancy at the University of Edinburgh,external, tells BBC Scotland there is ""really strong evidence"" that pregnant women are more likely than other women to be admitted to hospital and intensive care. ""We also know that although we've had no deaths in Scotland yet, data from around the world and in particular the United States has shown higher mortality rates with Covid-19 in pregnancy than in non-pregnant women,"" she says. You can read more about the report here. Ted McSweeney says he has ""completely lost trust in the whole system"" after he received three negative PCR results at a testing site in Swindon, despite getting positive results from lateral flow tests. He only tested positive with a PCR test after using a home testing kit. After his first negative PCR result, Ted says he called NHS Test and Trace to ask for advice. ""They were happy for me to go back to work. But I had symptoms and I had a positive lateral flow test and said 'somethingâs not right here', so I booked another test,"" he says. He continued getting PCR tests for six days, but all came back negative. At this stage he had decided to isolate anyway, because he was ""sure"" he had the virus. After the third negative PCR, he contacted Test and Trace and was sent a home testing kit - that came back positive. He adds that he was then given conflicting information about when he could go back to work. ""Itâs made me lose faith in the whole system,"" he says. ""If they donât know, how do we know?"" In a statement, Wales' Health Minister Eluned Morgan says her government was made aware last week of the UK Health Security Agency's investigation into higher than expected numbers of positive lateral flow tests followed by negative PCR results. She says the issue is isolated to a private laboratory in Wolverhampton and does not involve the wider network, including the IP5 laboratory in Newport that processes the majority of
Welsh samples. Anyone
who had a test from 4 October and received a result from the affected
laboratory will be contacted by NHS Test and Trace and advised to get another test if their initial PCR result was negative. Close contacts who have symptoms will also be advised to book another test. People
who had a test processed at the laboratory between 8 September and 4 October
will also be contacted and advised to get a test if they have symptoms. The majority of those affected by the issue are in south-west England but some people in south-east England and an estimated 4,000 people in Wales may have been impacted. You can read more about the situation in Wales here. An estimated 4,000 Welsh residents may have been given inaccurate PCR results by the private laboratory in Wolverhampton, where NHS Test and Trace has suspended testing operations. In a statement, the Welsh government says the
majority of these tests would have been taken at testing sites across the Gwent
and Cwm Taf Morgannwg areas. If you receive a negative PCR test after a positive lateral flow result - and have not been contacted by NHS Test and Trace to say this may have been a false negative - the UK Health Security Agency says its advice remains the same as previously. It confirms to the BBC that individuals do not need to self-isolate in this case. It says anyone with Covid symptoms should book a PCR test and those with a positive lateral flow result should get a follow-up PCR test to confirm this. We've been speaking to more people who fear they may have been affected by false negative PCR test results. Graham Loader, from Newbury, believes his family are among those to receive incorrect results from the Newbury Showground testing site in West Berkshire. The council says the lab issue may affect those who took a PCR test at the site between 3 and 12 October. Three members of his family all had negative PCR results after positive lateral flow results in late September and early October. His 11-year-old son received a negative PCR result on 30 September, while his wife received a negative result on 1 October and he got one on 6 October. As a result, he tells the BBC he ""strongly suspects"" the dates given by the council are wrong. While his son didn't have any symptoms, Graham and his wife suffered tiredness and headaches. However, as they were not experiencing any of the three main Covid symptoms - a high temperature, continuous cough or change to their sense of smell or taste - they assumed the lateral flow tests must have been faulty. ""After getting the PCRs back weâve gone about our usual
business,"" Graham says. ""I completely trusted the PCR so I feel bad for all the
people Iâve been in contact with."" Meanwhile, away from the UK, vaccinated Australian citizens and the parents of residents will be able to visit Sydney from 1 November without the need to quarantine. Australia's borders have effectively been closed since March 2020, making it difficult even for citizens to enter. ""We are not opening up to everyone coming back to Australia at the moment,"" Prime Minister Scott Morrison says. He explains that priority will be given to Australians and family members, after which the nation will consider migrants, those with work and study visas and the ""challenge"" of tourists.

Adele's comeback single: Hit or miss?Easy On Me is the singer's first new material since 2015 - but what does it tell us about the star?Entertainment & Arts,"This video can not be played Easy On Me is the first new music released by Adele in six years After a slow-burning PR campaign, Adele's first new music in six years has arrived. Easy On Me, a spare and emotional piano ballad, was released at midnight UK time, offering fans the first glimpse of her ""divorce album"", entitled 30. That will be her follow-up to massively successful albums 19, 21 and 25. Easy On Me sees Adele explaining her decision to walk away from her marriage in 2019, while asking her son and ex-husband for understanding. ""I changed who I was to put you both first,"" she sings, ""but now I give up"". That moment, so naked and unvarnished, sends shivers down your spine. Adele's voice is full of regret, but also resolve. 'Thank you, Adele - I got divorced young too' In the accompanying music video, director Xavier Dolan chooses this moment to transition from black and white to full colour - making clear that this is the sound of a woman who has dismantled her entire world, realising that she needn't feel guilty for putting herself first.

Adele addresses the chorus, ""go easy on me"", to herself as much as her family - and she accepts it's too soon for them to see her point of view. ""I had good intentions / And the highest hopes / But I know, right now / It probably doesn't even show."" The song was apparently the first track written for Adele's forthcoming album, and dates back to the year of her separation. The immediacy of those emotions is apparent in her vocal, simultaneously strong and vulnerable. But there's also a generosity to the song. Adele is reaching out to the people she's hurt, but Easy On Me is also a big woolly blanket wrapped around the loneliness and pain of anyone who's been through a core-shaking break-up. Adele says new album will explain divorce to son Adele finalises divorce with joint custody of son Adele sings and jokes about weight as she hosts SNL It's already proved to be a hit. Just under 300,000 people tuned in to watch the video premiere on YouTube. Within 12 hours it had been streamed 12 million times. The single comes just five weeks before her new album  - which was first teased in a global marketing campaign that saw the number 30 projected on to buildings and billboards in Brazil, Mexico, Dubai, Italy, Germany, Ireland, the US and the UK. Fans correctly guessed the release date of 19 November when Taylor Swift moved her forthcoming album forward by a week, apparently to avoid a clash with Adele. Easy On Me was co-written with Adele's frequent collaborator Greg Kurstin Like her previous three albums the title is a reference to a specific age in Adele's life. Thirty is the age at which she married her long-term partner, Simon Konecki, and then left him. The star has said the album was recorded to help her eight-year-old son understand their divorce the following year. ""I wanted to explain to him through this record, when he's in his 20s or 30s, who I am and why I voluntarily chose to dismantle his entire life in the pursuit of my own happiness,""she told Vogue magazine.,external ""It made him really unhappy sometimes. And that's a real wound for me that I don't know if I'll ever be able to heal,"" she added. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Speaking to BBC Radio 2's Zoe Ball, the singer said the album ""was bloody hard work to make"". ""I was singing things I didn't even realise I was feeling or thinking,"" she said, adding that it was important for her to share those emotions with the world. ""I feel like I can't unlock a door for my own mental health and take the key with me. I've got to leave it in the door for everyone else - and I'm in a strong place now where I feel like I can put that vulnerability out. Allow Twitter content?

In a separate interview with BBC Radio 1's Greg James, she admitted that her friends hadn't been too impressed by Easy On Me when she played them the demo. ""I sent a snippet of it, as I was writing it, to three of my closest friends,"" she said. ""One didn't like it, one was like, 'keep trying', and the other was like, 'I'm busy working'. So that was the perfect response."" BBC Sounds: Adele on Radio 1 Once it was finished, however, ""they loved it"". ""And I don't do any music in my time off. It's not a muscle that I exercise - writing or singing,"" she added. ""So most of the time, even just for my best friends and my manager, their first reaction, no matter what the song is, is, 'it's just nice to hear you sing'."" While Easy On Me is very much a traditional Adele ballad, there have been hints that the rest of the album will showcase a more experimental side to Adele's music. According to Vogue, one track features her vocals ""sampled and resampled over a hypnotic beat"", that is reminiscent of electro-pop act Goldfrapp. She has also worked with London-based producer Inflo - responsible for the retro R&B sounds of Michael Kiwanuka and Little Simz - as well as the Oscar-winning composer of the Black Panther score, Ludwig GÃ¶ransson. Radio 2 DJ Jo Whiley, who has been played a handful of the songs, said there are ""all kinds"" of sounds and genres on the album. ""There's one that I listened to and it just made me feel incredibly sad,"" she added. ""She really does pour her heart out and her voice, I think, has never sounded better. ""I was really surprised by the heights that she reaches - and the power and the resonance within her voice is amazing."" The music world meanwhile has been reacting to Adele's long-awaited return, with Canadian star Drake alerting his Instagram followers to the fact that ""one of my best friends in the world just dropped a single"". Solo star and former Fifth Harmony memberNormani declared,external: ""Adele oh Adele I love uuuuuuuu."" Elsewhere, Clueless film star Alicia Silverstone posted a humorous video on TikTok of her preparing to drown her sorrows while listening the London singer's latest heartfelt offering.

However it sounds, 30 is certain to be a shot in the arm for the UK music industry. Only one British album released since the start of 2020, Dua Lipa's Future Nostalgia, has sold the 300,000 copies required to be awarded a platinum disc. It took her 10 months to achieve that feat. By contrast, Adele's last album, 25, went platinum in its first 24 hours. It went on to become the UK's 14th best-selling album of all time, with sales in excess of 3.6 million. Sony, her new record label, will be hoping to match those sorts of sales heights - although the CD market has declined precipitously since 2015; and Adele's streaming numbers don't yet match those of her peers. She currently has 22 million monthly listeners on Spotify, compared to Ed Sheeran's 75 million and Taylor Swift's 46.5 million. New music will undoubtedly boost those figures, however, even if Adele faces stiff competition from Sheeran, Swift, Abba and Coldplay, who will all release new material in the coming weeks. Martin Talbot, chief executive of the Official Charts Company, described the pile-up as an ""embarrassment of riches"" that is almost unprecedented for the music retail sector - but he predicted Adele would emerge on top. ""It would be a brave man who predicted anything other than 30 being the biggest album of this Christmas,"" he told the BBC. ""And, with certifications now also reflecting streams, as well as traditional physical and download sales, it is in with a strong chance of going platinum in its first week.""

Why are ScotRail workers striking during COP26?,"The Scottish government will take over ScotRail from Abellio in March of next year ScotRail engineers have said they will take strike action that will ""severely disrupt"" the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow. It is the latest stage in a long-running dispute over pay and conditions and proposed cuts to services at the rail operator, which wants to reduce the number of services across Scotlandby 300 a day from next May. Unions and management are due to meet again on Tuesday afternoon, when a fresh offer is expected to be made to workers. ScotRail is currently run by Dutch firm Abellio - but will be taken over by acompany owned and controlled by the Scottish governmentin March of next year. The move was announced by the government earlier this year after Abellio wasstripped of its contractthree years early amid concern over its performance. The climate summit will be held at the Scottish Events Campus in Glasgow The Unite union said on Monday that about 250 engineers - who maintain and repair ScotRail's fleet of trains - would stage a series of 24-hour strikes in the coming weeks. Several of the dates clash with the climate summit, which will see world leaders come to Glasgow from 31 October until 12 November. The union said it had been left with no choice due to what it described as the ""reckless"" actions of Abellio ScotRail management and its failure to make a ""meaningful"" pay offer. The company has previously rejected a number of demands, including a ""substantial"" pay increase, greater flexibility of holidays, and no compulsory redundancies. And unions have questioned why ferry workers can be given a 4.8% pay increase but rail workers cannot. A number of rail depots, workplaces and stations will be impacted by the strikes, including Glasgow Queen Street and Glasgow Central, Edinburgh Waverley and Perth. Unite's industrial officer, Pat McIlvogue, accused ScotRail of having attempted to spin out and delay talks over pay in an attempt to ""avoid the national embarrassment"" of having strike action during COP26. But he said this had now ""backfired"" - and predicted that the conference and other events would be severely disrupted by the industrial action. He also called on the Scottish government to intervene in the dispute. Rail services have largely ground to a halt on Sundays since strike action began in March Conductors who are members of the RMT unionvoted in March to take strike actionin a dispute about overtime pay, which centres around conductors being paid less than drivers for working on rest days. That industrial action is still ongoing and has wiped out the vast majority of ScotRail services on a Sunday for the past six months - with neither side in the dispute showing any sign of backing down. ScotRail said it was facing a ""stark"" financial situation in the wake of the pandemic, and said everyone needed to work together to modernise the railway so it is fit for the future. And it said it would continue to engage with trade unions to find an agreement on pay and conditions. Passenger numbers on trains across the country have plummeted during the pandemic Abellio ScotRailrecorded losses of Â£64.5min the financial year to March 2020 - before the full impact of the pandemic hit - and has been receiving emergency funding from the government since then to help it cope with the massive reduction in passenger numbers. The rail operator says it wants to introduce a new timetable in May of next year that would see it run 2,100 services on a weekday rather than the 2,400 that were running before Covid. The figure is slightly higher than the reduced number of about 2,000 daily services that have been running during the pandemic. ScotRail says it had been providing ""significantly more seats"" than were required by passengers on several routes across the country before the pandemic - with only about a quarter of seats taken on the average day. It said most passengers would not see any great change to services at their station, and insisted that the new timetable will help to improve the punctuality and reliability of services. ScotRail added: ""Returning to a pre-pandemic timetable would result in trains operating 26 million more vehicle miles each year for little customer benefit. ""As well as increased emissions, that would increase ScotRail costs to the taxpayer by Â£30m to Â£40m each year."" Rail union members were joined by Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar in a protest outside the first minister's official residence Unions believe that cutting rail services will also result in jobs being lost, and argue that the move is incompatible with the Scottish government's aim of encouraging more people to use public transport. They have also warned that the cuts will hit vulnerable people, particularly the elderly and disabled, hardest, and have claimed that the country only has ""six months to save Scotland's railways"". The main rail unions - the RMT, Aslef, TSSA and Unite - say the Scottish government has the powers to block the cuts to services now, despite not formally taking over ScotRail for another six months. They say this is because the government is already effectively managing the ScotRail franchise under emergency powers that were introduced in April of last year to ensure trains continued to run throughout the Covid pandemic. The four unions recently held a joint protest outside the first minister's Bute House residence, with RMT general secretary Mick Lynch saying the government ""cannot evade responsibility"" over the proposed cuts. He added: ""âWith COP26 just weeks away, it beggars belief that the Scottish government is happy to preside over massive cuts to rail services, despite this being a sustainable and low carbon form of transport. ""This will do nothing to make Scotland a 'net zero nation' and will just push more people into cars."" Transport Minister Graeme Dey said that the government had been encouraging the unions and ScotRail management ""for many months"" to come to a resolution in the dispute. And he called on both sides to ""step back from some of the rhetoric"" and instead focus on coming to an agreement. Speaking to the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme on Tuesday, he said spending on Scotland's railways was about Â£1bn before the pandemic but was now more than Â£1.5bn. He said this was not sustainable, so efficiency savings would have to be made. And he said he hoped that the unions would view the new offer from ScotRail ""in the spirit in which it is being made"", and that they would consider settling the dispute.

Rise in pregnant women needing Covid ICU treatment,"The number of pregnant women needing intensive care has gone up despite overall ICU numbers going down More than 20% of women admitted to intensive care for Covid-19 since May 2021 were pregnant or had recently given birth, a study has found. A Scottish Intensive Care Audit Group report said 42 had been admitted since 18 May 2021, compared with 25 in the first two waves of the pandemic. The number has gone up despite overall intensive care numbers reducing. The Scottish government said vaccines were the best way to protect against the risks of Covid in pregnancy. The Scottish Intensive Care Audit Group (SICAG) report,externalfound that no deaths of pregnant women following ICU treatment had been reported up to 19 September 2021. The report counts pregnant women admitted to ICUs and women who were admitted within six weeks of giving birth. Admission to high dependency units, used for managing high risk pregnancies, were not included in the figures. In the first two waves of the pandemic in Scotland, between 1 March 2020 and 17 May 2021, 1,850 Covid patients were admitted to ICU, according to SICAG. Of this number, 630 were women and about 4% of them were pregnant or had recently given birth. Since 18 May 2021, 189 women have required intensive care treatment for Covid-19 and 22.2% of them have been pregnant. Dr Sarah Stock, a consultant in maternal and foetal medicine, said it was still uncertain what had caused the rise. ""It could be because a much lower proportion of pregnant women are vaccinated, or it could be because pregnant women are particularly susceptible to severe disease from the Delta variant that has predominated during the third wave - but we don't know for sure yet,"" she said. But Dr Stock, who is co-leadinga study into Covid-19 in pregnancy at the University of Edinburgh,external, told BBC Scotland there was ""really strong evidence"" that pregnant women were more likely than other women to be admitted to hospital and intensive care. ""We also know that although we've had no deaths in Scotland yet, data from around the world and in particular the United States has shown higher mortality rates with Covid-19 in pregnancy than in non-pregnant women,"" she said. The consultant said there was also evidence Covid-19 led to higher premature birth rates and probably caused more stillbirths as well. ""Being pregnant affects your response to infections. We know that pregnant women are more susceptible to viruses - and this is probably what we're seeing with Covid-19."" The SICAG study's authors said they had found ""very few"" critical care admissions among pregnant women during the first and second waves of the pandemic. The report continued: ""Wave three has seen increased numbers of pregnant women being admitted to hospital with moderate to severe Covid-19 symptoms requiring critical care. ""The majority of patients were pregnant on admission to critical care and 30% were admitted after delivery."" Most of the women lived in the most deprived areas of Scotland, the report added. The report also found that none of the women who required treatment in intensive care were fully vaccinated at the time of admission. A separate report by Public Health Scotland (PHS),external, published on 6 October, found vaccine take-up among pregnant women in Scotland was low across all age groups. PHS estimates that of the 77,679 women who were pregnant between December 2020 and August 2021, about 18% received at least a first dose. The over-40s have achieved the best level of vaccine coverage so far at 26.5%. The figure drops to 7% in the under-19s. Although younger age groups were vaccinated later in the roll-out programme, general coverage in all age groups apart from 12-17 year olds in August was above 70%. Dr Pat O'Brien, vice president of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, said a number of factors could be influencing the increase in ICU admission figures. For example, he said an increase in birth rates this year could lead to higher numbers in ICU, as a proportion of all pregnant women will always become severely ill from Covid-19. But he told BBC Scotland the ""key message"" was for pregnant women to make sure they were vaccinated. ""There is still a significant number of pregnant women being admitted to ICU with Covid. That's obviously bad for the woman, but it's also bad for the baby,"" he said. ""All of this is preventable by a vaccine that is perfectly safe to take in pregnancy."" Vaccination take-up among women is low across all age groups when compared with the rest of the population A Scottish government spokesperson said: ""It is clear from the report that unvaccinated people are considerably more likely to require ICU treatment, so it remains vital that everyone who is eligible takes up the offer of vaccination, as this will protect the NHS and save lives. ""This includes pregnant women, as vaccination is the best way of protecting against the risks of Covid in pregnancy.""

LiveLiveTens of thousands may have had wrong Covid result10 minutes ago,"NHS Test and Trace suspends Covid testing provided by a private laboratory in Wolverhampton amid fears up to 43,000 people were given the wrong result Dr Jenny Harries, the head of NHS Test and Trace, says it is not yet clear how or why the laboratory might have given incorrect results Harries adds there will be a ""serious incident investigation"" to ensure there are not problems at other testing laboratories Earlier, a mass testing site in Berkshire asked people who recently got a negative result to book another test It comes after reports that some people received negative PCR tests after testing positive using lateral flow devices But health officials say the problem is ""an isolated incident attributed to one laboratory"" and that they are investigating the cause Separately, travellers returning to England will be able to take cheaper lateral flow tests from 24 October Edited by Hamish Mackay We're bringing our live coverage to a close now, so here's a reminder of the main stories today: We'll be back on Monday with all the latest coronavirus news. In the meantime you can follow our main storyhereorvisit our front pagefor other news. Today's posts were written by Becky Morton and Hazel Shearing and edited by Hamish Mackay. The Scottish governmenthas requested military back-up for two NHS health boardsto relieve pressure ahead of the winter period. NHS Lanarkshire will receive three nurses, 45 medics, 12 general troops and three drivers, while 14 medics, two nurses and four additional personnel will be sent to NHS Borders. Both health boards have already halted all non-urgent procedures, blaming staff shortages and rising patient demand. It comes after soldiers were brought in tosupport the Scottish Ambulance Servicein September. A previously ""active"" and ""energetic"" GP has told the BBC she now has to use a wheelchair due to long Covid. Susannah Thompson, from Blyth, contracted coronavirus last year while working on the NHS frontline, and has since experienced long-lasting symptoms of the virus. The 41-year-old says she struggles to get out of bed and complete day-to-day tasks, but decided to start using a wheelchair to ""regain her independence"" and help others. This video can not be played Coronavirus: Blyth GP using wheelchair due to long Covid Prof Alan McNally, a microbiologist at the University of Birmingham, says he is ""astonished"" by the problems at the private laboratory in Wolverhampton and says they will be the result of ""appropriate controls not being used"". He tells the BBC he ""can't understand how itâs happened at this scale"". âIf you do that test properly with all appropriate controls then there is no way you should have missed sheer volume of false negative results we are talking about here,"" he says. âYou should see if you have this level of systematic failure."" He says it is a question of ""quality control and quality assurance, oversight and management"", adding: ""I cannot fathom the failings that would lead to this level of false negative results."" Boris Johnson was visiting a Rolls Royce factory in Bristol The prime minister says people should not be concerned after thousands may wrongly have been told their Covid tests were negativebecause of errors at a private lab. âWeâre looking into what went wrong with that particular testing centre, but is doesnât affect the overall numbers,"" Boris Johnson says. On a visit to Bristol, he tells reporters: ""Overall, the picture in the South West in the Bristol area and the rest of the country, remains very much where it has been for some time now. We are just getting along in a state of, more or less, an equilibrium."" He says that while there are quite high infection rates, particularly in young people ""that isn't really feeding through into the older generations in the way that we saw in previous spikes"". âThereâs no doubt that the wall of vaccination that the country has built is very high and very effective,"" he adds. He says the overall data shows the government is right to stick with its ""plan A"" for winter - meaning no additional restrictions are needed.  Helen Diggle, who lives in Tellisford in Somerset, says she
had five positive lateral flow tests and three negative PCRs before finally
testing positive for Covid on a PCR test. On one of her visits to a testing centre she said a member
of staff told her she had seen lots of very similar cases recently,
particularly involving local schools. Helen tells BBC News: âIt is really worrying that some
people in the system, people on the ground, have been aware that something is
going on.â When Helen and her 10-year-old daughter kept testing negative on PCRs despite high temperatures and positive lateral flow tests
she knew something was not right. âI was very conscious that by having all these tests I could
have been wasting NHS resources to satisfy my own conviction that I had Covid,"" she adds. âI felt like I was being unnecessarily neurotic.â But when her son tested positive on private PCR testing
equipment owned by his school, it was âblindingly obvious we all had Covid"", she says. Helen feels the situation is particularly unfair to
school children. âIf children test negative on PCR then schools have to take
children back,"" she says. âSo you probably have many more cases in school than they
are expected to deal with.â âI feel we have been short changed â particularly the
children â because testing is not working as it should be,"" she adds. ""My concern is it is leading not just the spread of the virus
but is eroding trust in the testing system.â Dr Harries is asked about a suggestion that officials in Wales - where some of the false results were - heard last week that there might be a problem with testing facilities. In response, she says it was ""very difficult to pinpoint exactly where it was"". ""We have been doing some really detailed investigations looking at the routes of travel of samples and of the types of samples, where they come from and who has been infected,"" she says. ""And obviously as soon as we got that information we worked with colleagues in Wales as well as other parts of the country."" She insists that ""the vast majority of tests throughout the UK have just been processed accurately and normally"". Wolverhampton Science Park, where the Immensa Health laboratory is based Dr Harries, who is also head of the UK Health Security Agency, says there will be ""a serious incident investigation"" within the organisation. ""I want to make sure if there are any further problems with other laboratories we can absolutely spot them as quickly as possible, so I will be conducting a serious incident investigation within the Health Security Agency to make sure we can mitigate any problems going forward,"" she says. She adds that the ""location of the laboratory combined with the geography and the time period"" of cases were key in allowing officials to spot the problem. Asked when officials first became aware of the issue, Dr Harries says there had been ""some feedback and some queries coming through over the last two or three weeks"" from public health directors in local communities. ""But itâs only in the last few days when we have dug right down into both the geography and the different type of tests coming back through and the different prevalence rates thatâs allowed us to pinpoint exactly what it is,"" she says. ""About half of these  cases are coming from the South West and that has allowed us to locate the laboratory."" Dr Harries says that anyone affected by the issue at the private laboratory in Wolverhampton will be contacted by NHS Test and Trace, with those whose tests have been processed in the past 10 days made a priority because they could still be infectious. ""We will be contacting by text message, by email... and will recommend they have another test,"" she says. But anyone whose tests were processed before then will still be contacted, she adds, because ""we clearly want to acknowledge that there has been a problem with that lab and just let them know"". Dr Harries adds that only a few thousand out of the 43,000 people affected by the wrong result could potentially be infectious now. âThe period of real infectivity is probably only reaching back about six or seven daysâ¦ so I think it will only be a few thousand people who will have positive tests in that total number,"" she says. ""It is very difficult to estimate. So we are obviously being cautious and just sending a message to all of them."" Dr Jenny Harries, the head of NHS Test and Trace, says it is ""not clear yet"" what went wrong in the private laboratory in Wolverhampton that has stopped operating due to fears people were given the wrong test results. She insists, however, that the ""rest of the system is working as normal"". Harries says that the laboratory is ""accredited to all of the appropriate standards"". It had been brought in to deal with an increase in surge testing from 8 September, and was also used during the surge in cases last winter. ""We are doing a detailed investigation with them, working on the actual processes within the laboratory â but the important thing of course is that we have suspended all of their services,"" she says. ""As soon as we establish what the problem is, then clearly we will have to look at that in detail. We will definitely not be using them until all of those processes are clear."" Covid-19 is continuing to spread around the world. The US, India and Brazil have seen the highest number of confirmed cases since the start of the pandemic, followed by the UK, Russia and Turkey. There have now been around 240 million confirmed cases since the start of the pandemic. Here's how that number has grown over time. The number of daily cases is stable or falling in most regions, except Europe.  China and India have given out the most vaccine doses, followed by the US. But when breaking the figures down by doses per 100 people in countries with a population of at least one million, Cuba, the United Arab Emirates and Uruguay top the list. Covid infections in England and Wales increased in the week to 9 October, according to the latest ONS estimates. Estimated infections were little changed in Northern Ireland but decreased in Scotland. The number of people with coronavirus for each nation is estimated to be: Just over one million people in the UK are estimated to have had Covid in the week to 9 October - the highest figure since the end of January, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). This is 1.5% of the population â or one in 65 people â up from one in 70 the previous week. The ONS survey is based on testing a random sample of people from private households. More than 20% of women admitted to intensive care for Covid-19 in Scotland since May 2021 were pregnant or had recently given birth, a study has found. A Scottish Intensive Care Audit Group report says 42 had been admitted since 18 May 2021, compared with 25 in the first two waves of the pandemic. The number has gone up despite overall intensive care numbers reducing. The Scottish government says vaccines are the best way to protect against the risks of Covid in pregnancy. Dr Stock, who is co-leadinga separate study into Covid-19 in pregnancy at the University of Edinburgh,external, tells BBC Scotland there is ""really strong evidence"" that pregnant women are more likely than other women to be admitted to hospital and intensive care. ""We also know that although we've had no deaths in Scotland yet, data from around the world and in particular the United States has shown higher mortality rates with Covid-19 in pregnancy than in non-pregnant women,"" she says. You can read more about the report here. Ted McSweeney says he has ""completely lost trust in the whole system"" after he received three negative PCR results at a testing site in Swindon, despite getting positive results from lateral flow tests. He only tested positive with a PCR test after using a home testing kit. After his first negative PCR result, Ted says he called NHS Test and Trace to ask for advice. ""They were happy for me to go back to work. But I had symptoms and I had a positive lateral flow test and said 'somethingâs not right here', so I booked another test,"" he says. He continued getting PCR tests for six days, but all came back negative. At this stage he had decided to isolate anyway, because he was ""sure"" he had the virus. After the third negative PCR, he contacted Test and Trace and was sent a home testing kit - that came back positive. He adds that he was then given conflicting information about when he could go back to work. ""Itâs made me lose faith in the whole system,"" he says. ""If they donât know, how do we know?"" In a statement, Wales' Health Minister Eluned Morgan says her government was made aware last week of the UK Health Security Agency's investigation into higher than expected numbers of positive lateral flow tests followed by negative PCR results. She says the issue is isolated to a private laboratory in Wolverhampton and does not involve the wider network, including the IP5 laboratory in Newport that processes the majority of
Welsh samples. Anyone
who had a test from 4 October and received a result from the affected
laboratory will be contacted by NHS Test and Trace and advised to get another test if their initial PCR result was negative. Close contacts who have symptoms will also be advised to book another test. People
who had a test processed at the laboratory between 8 September and 4 October
will also be contacted and advised to get a test if they have symptoms. The majority of those affected by the issue are in south-west England but some people in south-east England and an estimated 4,000 people in Wales may have been impacted. You can read more about the situation in Wales here. An estimated 4,000 Welsh residents may have been given inaccurate PCR results by the private laboratory in Wolverhampton, where NHS Test and Trace has suspended testing operations. In a statement, the Welsh government says the
majority of these tests would have been taken at testing sites across the Gwent
and Cwm Taf Morgannwg areas. If you receive a negative PCR test after a positive lateral flow result - and have not been contacted by NHS Test and Trace to say this may have been a false negative - the UK Health Security Agency says its advice remains the same as previously. It confirms to the BBC that individuals do not need to self-isolate in this case. It says anyone with Covid symptoms should book a PCR test and those with a positive lateral flow result should get a follow-up PCR test to confirm this. We've been speaking to more people who fear they may have been affected by false negative PCR test results. Graham Loader, from Newbury, believes his family are among those to receive incorrect results from the Newbury Showground testing site in West Berkshire. The council says the lab issue may affect those who took a PCR test at the site between 3 and 12 October. Three members of his family all had negative PCR results after positive lateral flow results in late September and early October. His 11-year-old son received a negative PCR result on 30 September, while his wife received a negative result on 1 October and he got one on 6 October. As a result, he tells the BBC he ""strongly suspects"" the dates given by the council are wrong. While his son didn't have any symptoms, Graham and his wife suffered tiredness and headaches. However, as they were not experiencing any of the three main Covid symptoms - a high temperature, continuous cough or change to their sense of smell or taste - they assumed the lateral flow tests must have been faulty. ""After getting the PCRs back weâve gone about our usual
business,"" Graham says. ""I completely trusted the PCR so I feel bad for all the
people Iâve been in contact with."" Meanwhile, away from the UK, vaccinated Australian citizens and the parents of residents will be able to visit Sydney from 1 November without the need to quarantine. Australia's borders have effectively been closed since March 2020, making it difficult even for citizens to enter. ""We are not opening up to everyone coming back to Australia at the moment,"" Prime Minister Scott Morrison says. He explains that priority will be given to Australians and family members, after which the nation will consider migrants, those with work and study visas and the ""challenge"" of tourists.

Rail union rejects pay offer to avoid COP26 strikesThe RMT warned there will be no trains running anywhere in Scotland during COP26 if the strikes go ahead.,"A pay offer to avoid Scotland's rail network being crippled by strikes during COP26 is ""is not worthy of consideration"", a union has said. The RMT said members who work for ScotRail and Caledonian Sleeperwill stage industrial action during the UN climate summit in Glasgow. The dispute is linked to an ongoing row over pay which has affected Sunday services in recent months. ScotRail said its latest two-year offer of 4.7% was ""very reasonable"". But Michael Hogg, from the RMT union, said it would not ballot ScotRail workers on a deal he described as ""rotten"" and ""lousy"" as it also involved efficiency savings. That would mean workers having to give up some current terms and conditions in order to get a pay rise, a caveat Mr Hogg branded ""unacceptable"". Mr Hogg told BBC Radio'sGood Morning Scotlandprogramme there will be no trains running anywhere in Scotland during COP26 if the strikes go ahead. He added: ""Our representatives do not feel that this offer is worthy of consideration. It's a kick in the teeth to key, essential workers."" On Thursday, it was announced staff will strike from 00:01 on Monday 1 November until 23:59 on Friday 12 November. The global COP26 summit, which is expected to draw thousands of people to Glasgow, runs from 31 October until 12 November. Sleeper staff will strike on Sunday 31 October from 11:59 until 11:58 hours on Tuesday 2 November and again for 48 hours on Thursday 11 November from 11:59. GMB cleansing workers in Glasgow and Unite's Stagecoach staff have also voted to strike during COP26. ScotRail and Caledonian Sleeper strike confirmed during COP26 Why are ScotRail workers striking during COP26? New pay offer in bid to halt ScotRail strikes ScotRail operations manager David Simpson told Good Morning Scotland ""a very positive offer"" was made to the union last weekend and he had expected it to be put to the RMT's members. But instead it called a strike, a move he said was ""very frustrating and very disappointing"". Mr Simpson denied ScotRail had been ""stonewalling"" the union and said the pandemic had prompted more discussion over the last 18 months than ever before. He added: ""Many workers would say 4.7% over two years is anything but a derisory offer and it compares well with other industries."" All scheduled trains will be cancelled if the strikes go ahead Kathryn Darbandi, managing director for Serco Caledonian Sleeper, said any action during the climate summit would be incredibly damaging. She said: ""We have repeatedly tabled realistic and reasonable offers which we believe should have ended the dispute. ""Industrial action during COP26 - when the eyes of the world will be on Scotland - risks both the reputation of rail as an environmentally-friendly and sustainable mode of transport, but also the great progress the entire team at Caledonian Sleeper have made in building back the confidence of our guests. ""The RMT's action does not reflect the reality of the financial situation facing all parties in Scotland's railway today, as we seek to rebuild the industry for the future. We need to work together, and we continue to be open to realistic discussions."" The climate summit will be held at the Scottish Events Campus in Glasgow Transport Minister Graeme Dey said that the RMT was in receipt of a ""very fair"" pay proposal. And he told Good Morning Scotland many of its members will have voted for strike action ""unaware of the offer that is now on the table"". Mr Dey also described the two-year deal, which he said has been backed by the three other unions involved, was ""the best offer that can be made in the circumstances"". But Scottish Conservative transport spokesman Graham Simpson accused the Scottish government of distancing themselves from the dispute. He said: ""Glasgow is about to take centre stage in a matter of weeks, and the SNP are still claiming they have no idea why rail strikes are continuing. ""SNP ministers must work with all parties to find a solution before these persisting strikes cast a shadow over the COP26 conference."" It is the latest stage in a long-running dispute over pay and conditions and proposed cuts to services at the rail operator, which wants to reduce the number of services across Scotlandby 300 a day from next May. ScotRail is currently run by Dutch firm Abellio - but will be taken over by acompany owned and controlled by the Scottish governmentin March next year. The move was announced by the government earlier this year after Abellio wasstripped of its contractthree years early amid concern over its performance. Transport Scotland said it welcomed constructive talks between all parties and that a ""significant offer"" has been made by employers since the RMT ballot opened. A spokeswoman said: ""We understand that the RMT will now ballot its membership again on the substance of this offer. We hope that RMT members and the other unions will agree and accept this offer, putting to an end existing and proposed industrial disputes and action. ""Rail workers have played their part in keeping the country moving through the pandemic and we are sure that they will see the importance of the moment and the role they can play in showing the best Scotland's Railway has to offer as we welcome world leaders from across the globe to COP26."" Meanwhile, Chris Mitchell of the GMB denied cleansing workers in Glasgow were using the global climate conference as a bargaining chip. Mr Mitchell claimed his members had been ""put in a corner"" by Cosla despite their ""heroic efforts"" during the pandemic. And he told Good Morning Scotland the current pay offer of Â£850 a year would only amount to an extra Â£6.50 a week, after tax and National Insurance was taken off. Mr Mitchell said he acknowledged the importance of COP26, but added: ""Cosla need to realise there is an emergency on their own door step."" The COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives.

Shoppers start to use Â£100 contactless card limit,"Contactless cards were initially designed for low-value purchases The spending limit on each use of a contactless card has now risen from Â£45 to Â£100 - but not every shop will accept the new payment threshold. Retailers say it could take months to update terminals before every shopper can spend up to Â£100, without the need to enter a four-digit Pin. The move aims to make purchases such as grocery shopping more convenient. But some warn it could lead to a rise in theft and one bank boss questioned whether shoppers want a higher limit. Some 60% of debit and credit card transactions in the UK were contactless in the first seven months of the year. These accounted for a total of 6.6 billion payments with a value of Â£81bn. The decision to increase the threshold was taken by the Treasury and the City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the decision would bring convenience for shoppers and a boost to the High Street following Covid lockdowns. Listen to the BBC podcast:5 Minutes On ... Cash - another nail in the coffin? When contactless card payments were introduced in 2007, the transaction limit was set at Â£10 and designed as an alternative to small change. The limit was raised gradually, to Â£15 in 2010, to Â£20 in 2012, and then to Â£30 in 2015. It was hurriedly increased to Â£45 last year as the pandemic accelerated a move away from cash. As the limit has increased, so has the frequency of its use. Despite sudden drops of all transactions during national lockdowns, the general trend has been continuing growth. That has come as consumers have been less likely to use banknotes and coins. The huge number of terminals which need to be updated means that Friday marks the first day of a gradual introduction of the new limit. ""It may take days, weeks, or even months for some retailers to make the necessary changes in their systems so that the new limit can take effect,"" said Andrew Cregan, payments policy adviser at the British Retail Consortium. ""Furthermore, some retailers may choose not to adopt the new contactless limit. As a result, customers will need to take care when making payments to check what the maximum contactless limit is for individual stores."" Rural vacuum for getting hold of cash Cash access as vital as running water, says Age UK Campaigners have been concerned that as card and digital payments become more prevalent, it could affect access to cash for those who still rely on it. FCA research found that a greater proportion of consumers were finding it difficult to cope with fewer retailers accepting cash during the pandemic. However, it found that eight out of 10 small and medium-sized businesses said they were ""very likely"" to accept cash over the next five years. Graham Farrell, professor of crime science at the University of Leeds, has warned about the ""huge increase"" in attractiveness of bag snatches and pickpocketing by teenage thieves, who could then spend more on a stolen card. Academic Graham Farrell says there are risks of rising crime Heco-authored a paper,externalpointing out that these young criminals could then go on to long-term criminal careers. A thief will now be able to spend more on an unreported stolen card before a Pin is demanded. FCA guidance suggests a cumulative Â£300 needs to be spent on contactless before a purchase is checked by a Pin, up from the previous recommended level of Â£130. Prof Farrell told the BBC a halfway house was needed. ""A solution that would balance both sides would be tap-and-Pin. You would have contactless tapping of the card on a machine, without the trouble of putting it in and out of the machine. You would use Pin codes to ensure security, therefore making the theft of the card - as the thieves do not have the Pin - less attractive,"" he said. Authorities have sought to allay any concerns about an increase in fraud, pointing out that there was no rise in the crime after the last increase in the payment limit. Fraudsters steal Â£4m a day as crime surges ""What's more, we have seen no material increase in fraudulent transactions in other countries where the contactless limit increased to the equivalent of Â£100 or above,"" a spokesman for the FCA said. Australia and Singapore have contactless limits of the equivalent of about Â£100, and Canada's is close to Â£150. Customers of a variety of banks can switch off the contactless function, or request a non-contactless card. Some - notably Lloyds Banking Group and Starling - will allow customers to set their own contactless limit via the banks' apps. Anne Boden, chief executive of Starling Bank, questioned whether consumers really wanted to be able to spend more on Pin-free transactions. ""Analysing our spending data we can see that there appears to be little demand for the increased contactless limit and that many would like to retain the same contactless limit or even reduce it,"" she said. Shoppers can spend more than Â£100 without a Pin using payment services on smartphones, although they include in-built security on the devices such as fingerprint authorisation.

Italy port workers strike over Covid pass rules,"Protests against the Green Pass began early on Friday outside the big Adriatic port of Trieste Dockers at three big ports have staged protests at the requirement for all Italian workers to show a Covid pass. The Green Pass shows whether you have had the Covid vaccine, recovered from it or had a negative test. It became mandatory for all workplaces on Friday. About 6,000 workers went on strike outside Trieste port, a maritime gateway for northern Italy, Germany, Austria and central Europe. There was disruption in Genoa and Ancona too, but dockers worked normally in Italy's other major ports at Venice, Palermo, Naples and Gioia Tauro, Ansa news agency reported. About three million Italian workers are estimated to be still unvaccinated and protests were reported in many of the big cities: In Trieste, where only 40% of 950 port workers have had the jab, protesters chanted anti-government slogans as well as ""No Green Pass"" Protesters blocked a key access road to Genoa's Sopraelevata road bridge, the main route from the centre to the west of the city Strikes affected companies including Electrolux and San Benedetto Two thousand people joined a demonstration in Bologna's central Piazza Maggiore Hundreds of protesters occupied the Piazza Santa Maria Novella in central Florence Similar numbers were reported in the Piazza Castello in Turin and a sit-in was planned at Rome's ancient Circus Maximus The move to make the Covid pass compulsory for workers is among the world's toughest anti-Covid measures. A worker without a Green Pass risks being suspended without pay and may be fined up to â¬1,500 (Â£1,270; $1,740). The pass, introduced in June, was already required for teachers and other school workers, for access to bars and restaurants and for leisure venues such as cinemas and football stadiums. There were protests outside the big port at Trieste, and in Genoa (pictured) Italy's coalition government, led by Mario Draghi, is extending it in the hope of avoiding another lockdown. Two-thirds of Italians consider it necessary, according to an Ipsos opinion poll this week. However, opponents rioted in Rome on 9 October. The far-right Forza Nuova party led violent protesters who vandalised the CGIL trade union building in Rome, during clashes with police. Overall more than 85% of Italians aged over 12 have had at least one jab, and officials said a further 1.2 million vaccinations had been carried out in the past week. ""It is time to stop the economy, which is perhaps the only way we can show this government that many people are struggling,"" port workers' spokesman Stefano Puzzer told Rai TV. ""We will carry on until the Green Pass goes."" On 9 October far-right opponents of the Green Pass clashed with Rome police Ministers have played down fears of chaos, citing the high rate of vaccination. But disruption could hit the transport sector too, as many lorry drivers are foreigners who are either unvaccinated or have had jabs not recognised by the European Medicines Agency. Umberto Ruggero of Italy's logistics association said 30%-40% of staff might not show up. He spoke of a ""perfect storm"", with the sector already suffering from chronic understaffing. Dock workers in Trieste had offered to call off their action if the government delayed making the Green Pass obligatory until the end of October, but that was rejected by Rome. Italy launched its Covid Green Pass - a digital certificate - in June Business lobby group Confindustria strongly supports the Green Pass. Italy was the first European country to suffer a healthcare crisis in the pandemic, and has had more than 130,000 Covid deaths. There are fears that Italy's pharmacies may not cope with the pressure of providing many more Covid tests under the new regime. Unions failed to secure free tests for workers - something also demanded by Matteo Salvini's nationalist League, which is in the government.

Two cross-border meetings expected to be cancelled,"The North-South Ministerial Council (NSMC) was cancelled earlier after Edwin Poots failed to turn up A Belfast businessman is to seek a court order aimed at forcing the Democratic Unionist Party to end its boycott of of most cross-border ministerial meetings. On Monday, the High Court ruledthe DUP's boycott was ""unlawful"". But on Friday two ministerial meetings were cancelled after the DUP's Edwin Poots failed to show. Businessman Sean Napier said he was seeking the court order as a ""guardian of the Good Friday Agreement"". Mr Napier, who mounted the High Court challenge earlier this week, said the agreement was not an ""a la carte"" treaty. ""It has been there for us, it has kept peace here and it's imperative it is properly implemented in all its parts,"" he said. Mr Napier said the Good Friday Agreement was not an ""a la carte"" treaty Mr Napier added: ""It is very important in what it has done for the greater good of the people here. I think it is my duty to be its guardian."" DUP First Minister Paul Givan said no meetings were planned for Friday as he had not agreed the agendas. Northern Ireland's Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon and the Republic of Ireland's environment minister logged on, but her DUP ministerial colleague Edwin Poots did not. He was also a no show in a meeting with Junior Minister Declan Kearney and Irish Minister Darragh O'Brien. Mr Napier's solicitor Paul Farrell said the DUP must explain their position the ministerial meetings. ""I don't understand that a meeting that takes place today with accompanying ministers is not a meeting,"" he said. ""I think whatever we receive next week by way of response from DUP ministers will have to explain that. I cannot understand when a meeting is not a meeting."" Givan defends DUP boycott of north-south meetings DUP boycott of north-south meetings 'unlawful' The DUP boycott of most North-South Ministerial Council (NSMC) meetings wasannounced by party leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldsonlast month. The NSMC is the main body for cross-border co-operation between the governments of Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. It is attended by ministers from both sides of the border who oversee joint working in areas such as trade, food safety and agriculture. The DUP is refusing to attend in protest againstthe Northern Ireland Protocol. The protocol is part of the Brexit deal agreed in 2019 and was introduced to help prevent checks along the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. But unionists say it creates a barrier to trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and undermines the latter's position in the UK. Ms Mallon says the boycott must end The NI minister Ms Mallon said the boycott must end. She had been due to discuss cross-border aquaculture with her counterparts. ""It is astounding following this week's High Court ruling that Jeffrey Donaldson is overseeing a deliberate and unlawful boycott of the north-south institutions,"" she said. ""It shows only disdain for the rule of law but utter contempt for the people we represent."" On Thursday, ministers attended a NSMC meeting on health issues.

Extra Â£5.5m in GP funding for 'challenging winter'Funding will be used to improve systems for ordering repeat prescriptions and freeing up phone lines.Northern IrelandComments,"The Department of Health is making up to Â£5.5m available to support GP services in Northern Ireland over winter. Health Minister Robin Swann said he recognised the importance of people being able to access GP services. The funding will be used to improve technology and accessibility, and support patient care. Mr Swann said that services across health and social care were facing ""a challenging winter"". He has allocated Â£3.8m to support additional patient care during this time and up to Â£1.7m to further improve telephone and computer technology. He added that GP feedback showed that patients were presenting with more complex needs, making it difficult for GPs ""to see all the people they would wish to"". Department of Health figures show that GP practices are currently carrying out almost 200,000 consultations on a weekly basis. GP's 'distress' as patients complain about access Fall in GP surgery numbers in NI, report finds The health minister said that GP practices have been open throughout the pandemic and will continue to use both face-to-face appointments and alternative consultation options for patients. He said work was taking place to improve access to primary care for patients, including exploring how telephone systems could be better used to support services. He added that consideration was also being given to ways to better deal with routine requests, such as repeat prescriptions to release capacity. Robin Swann says that primary care services in NI were ""under increasing pressure"" before the pandemic ""This work is part of a wider programme to help improve patient access to services, which includes the wider rollout of primary care multi-disciplinary teams, and work to reform the out-of-hours service. ""I am committed to ensuring that we have a GP workforce that is supported, motivated and sustainable and that continues to provide quality care to patients when they need it."" He said work was taking place on a review of GP trainee places, to make sure there were ""enough GPs to meet our primary care needs into the future"". Londonderry GP Dr Nicola Duffy said she had asked the Department of Health to be allowed to see more patients in person. She said they were currently restricted by policy. She told BBC Radio Ulster 's Talkback programme that she was not allowed to see patients ""without social distancing, wearing a mask, regardless of whether I am vaccinated or not"". ""That is to protect the vulnerable patients that are using the health centre that I work in,"" she said. ""I am ready, my colleagues are ready. Could someone higher than me fix this, so we can get back to seeing our patients?"" Dr Alan Stout, chair of the British Medical Association of Northern Ireland, said he hoped the funding would help some of the immediate pressures that GPs were facing, ""as well as beginning to address some of the more systemic and complex issues, including the number of GP trainee places available"". Dr Alan Stout from the BMA said general practice has ""never closed"" ""General practice has not closed and never closed,"" he said. ""Consultation rates and the number of patients contacting their surgery continue to be high and the current system is struggling to cope. ""All of our staff are feeling the pressure and we recognise that the difficulty in access and delays in seeing your GP cause frustration to patients."" But will the extra money help to resolve the current difficulties many patients are facing when trying to get a face-to-face GP appointment? Dr Laurence Dorman, chair of the Royal College of General Practitioners Northern Ireland (RCGPNI), said the Â£5.5m was ""very welcome"" and would mean ""extra surgeries and extra colleagues"" to help meet patients' needs. However, he said it was ""short-term"" funding and what was really needed is longer-term financial support and more GPs to join the workforce. ""At the moment, there's no point putting an extra phone line into our surgery if we don't have a GP at the end of those lines to meet the needs of our patients,"" he explained. Dr Dorman also warned that Covid-19 continues to pose safety concerns in GP waiting rooms, particularly for vulnerable patients who need to attend surgeries for treatment. ""We're still in the middle of a pandemic and we have to work the way we do to meet infection control standards,"" he told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme. ""We simply not like hairdressers and shops - we have sick patients coming into our buildings.  We have patients who are taking blood tests, chemotherapy and we must be able to protect them,"" he said. ""We are seeing out patients face-to-face when it's appropriate and safe to do so, but we are still in a pandemic, we need our patients to work with us."" ""But if our patients need seen face-to-face, absolutely then their family doctor will do that."" Dr Laurence Dorman said GP were still seeing patients face-to-face when it was ""appropriate and safe to do so"" As well as his RCGPNI role, Dr Dorman works in a GP surgery in Kilkeel, County Down. Addressing complaints over the number of in person appointments being made available, he argued that GPs were working ""harder than ever"". Dr Dorman said the GP workforce was ""tired and exhausted"", adding that ""some of the negative criticism is really demoralising"". He argued that the increase in telephone consultations during the pandemic meant that family doctors were treating more patients than they had ever done before and were often able to provide a ""same-day"" service. He said GP services were undergoing an ""overall transformation"" like many parts of the health service, in an attempt to tailor services to patients' needs. ""This new way of working is actually suiting and working very well for some patients,"" he added. Dr Dorman said that pre-Covid, most patients frequently faced a two-week wait for a GP appointment, most of which were face-to-face. ""That didn't suit a lot of patients, particularly patients who worked, patients who had caring commitments, so these new ways of working which are going right across the health care system, right through to outpatients and so on, are important and necessary.""

Adele's comeback single: Hit or miss?Easy On Me is the singer's first new material since 2015 - but what does it tell us about the star?,"This video can not be played Easy On Me is the first new music released by Adele in six years After a slow-burning PR campaign, Adele's first new music in six years has arrived. Easy On Me, a spare and emotional piano ballad, was released at midnight UK time, offering fans the first glimpse of her ""divorce album"", entitled 30. That will be her follow-up to massively successful albums 19, 21 and 25. Easy On Me sees Adele explaining her decision to walk away from her marriage in 2019, while asking her son and ex-husband for understanding. ""I changed who I was to put you both first,"" she sings, ""but now I give up"". That moment, so naked and unvarnished, sends shivers down your spine. Adele's voice is full of regret, but also resolve. 'Thank you, Adele - I got divorced young too' In the accompanying music video, director Xavier Dolan chooses this moment to transition from black and white to full colour - making clear that this is the sound of a woman who has dismantled her entire world, realising that she needn't feel guilty for putting herself first.

Adele addresses the chorus, ""go easy on me"", to herself as much as her family - and she accepts it's too soon for them to see her point of view. ""I had good intentions / And the highest hopes / But I know, right now / It probably doesn't even show."" The song was apparently the first track written for Adele's forthcoming album, and dates back to the year of her separation. The immediacy of those emotions is apparent in her vocal, simultaneously strong and vulnerable. But there's also a generosity to the song. Adele is reaching out to the people she's hurt, but Easy On Me is also a big woolly blanket wrapped around the loneliness and pain of anyone who's been through a core-shaking break-up. Adele says new album will explain divorce to son Adele finalises divorce with joint custody of son Adele sings and jokes about weight as she hosts SNL It's already proved to be a hit. Just under 300,000 people tuned in to watch the video premiere on YouTube. Within 12 hours it had been streamed 12 million times. The single comes just five weeks before her new album  - which was first teased in a global marketing campaign that saw the number 30 projected on to buildings and billboards in Brazil, Mexico, Dubai, Italy, Germany, Ireland, the US and the UK. Fans correctly guessed the release date of 19 November when Taylor Swift moved her forthcoming album forward by a week, apparently to avoid a clash with Adele. Easy On Me was co-written with Adele's frequent collaborator Greg Kurstin Like her previous three albums the title is a reference to a specific age in Adele's life. Thirty is the age at which she married her long-term partner, Simon Konecki, and then left him. The star has said the album was recorded to help her eight-year-old son understand their divorce the following year. ""I wanted to explain to him through this record, when he's in his 20s or 30s, who I am and why I voluntarily chose to dismantle his entire life in the pursuit of my own happiness,""she told Vogue magazine.,external ""It made him really unhappy sometimes. And that's a real wound for me that I don't know if I'll ever be able to heal,"" she added. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Speaking to BBC Radio 2's Zoe Ball, the singer said the album ""was bloody hard work to make"". ""I was singing things I didn't even realise I was feeling or thinking,"" she said, adding that it was important for her to share those emotions with the world. ""I feel like I can't unlock a door for my own mental health and take the key with me. I've got to leave it in the door for everyone else - and I'm in a strong place now where I feel like I can put that vulnerability out. Allow Twitter content?

In a separate interview with BBC Radio 1's Greg James, she admitted that her friends hadn't been too impressed by Easy On Me when she played them the demo. ""I sent a snippet of it, as I was writing it, to three of my closest friends,"" she said. ""One didn't like it, one was like, 'keep trying', and the other was like, 'I'm busy working'. So that was the perfect response."" BBC Sounds: Adele on Radio 1 Once it was finished, however, ""they loved it"". ""And I don't do any music in my time off. It's not a muscle that I exercise - writing or singing,"" she added. ""So most of the time, even just for my best friends and my manager, their first reaction, no matter what the song is, is, 'it's just nice to hear you sing'."" While Easy On Me is very much a traditional Adele ballad, there have been hints that the rest of the album will showcase a more experimental side to Adele's music. According to Vogue, one track features her vocals ""sampled and resampled over a hypnotic beat"", that is reminiscent of electro-pop act Goldfrapp. She has also worked with London-based producer Inflo - responsible for the retro R&B sounds of Michael Kiwanuka and Little Simz - as well as the Oscar-winning composer of the Black Panther score, Ludwig GÃ¶ransson. Radio 2 DJ Jo Whiley, who has been played a handful of the songs, said there are ""all kinds"" of sounds and genres on the album. ""There's one that I listened to and it just made me feel incredibly sad,"" she added. ""She really does pour her heart out and her voice, I think, has never sounded better. ""I was really surprised by the heights that she reaches - and the power and the resonance within her voice is amazing."" The music world meanwhile has been reacting to Adele's long-awaited return, with Canadian star Drake alerting his Instagram followers to the fact that ""one of my best friends in the world just dropped a single"". Solo star and former Fifth Harmony memberNormani declared,external: ""Adele oh Adele I love uuuuuuuu."" Elsewhere, Clueless film star Alicia Silverstone posted a humorous video on TikTok of her preparing to drown her sorrows while listening the London singer's latest heartfelt offering.

However it sounds, 30 is certain to be a shot in the arm for the UK music industry. Only one British album released since the start of 2020, Dua Lipa's Future Nostalgia, has sold the 300,000 copies required to be awarded a platinum disc. It took her 10 months to achieve that feat. By contrast, Adele's last album, 25, went platinum in its first 24 hours. It went on to become the UK's 14th best-selling album of all time, with sales in excess of 3.6 million. Sony, her new record label, will be hoping to match those sorts of sales heights - although the CD market has declined precipitously since 2015; and Adele's streaming numbers don't yet match those of her peers. She currently has 22 million monthly listeners on Spotify, compared to Ed Sheeran's 75 million and Taylor Swift's 46.5 million. New music will undoubtedly boost those figures, however, even if Adele faces stiff competition from Sheeran, Swift, Abba and Coldplay, who will all release new material in the coming weeks. Martin Talbot, chief executive of the Official Charts Company, described the pile-up as an ""embarrassment of riches"" that is almost unprecedented for the music retail sector - but he predicted Adele would emerge on top. ""It would be a brave man who predicted anything other than 30 being the biggest album of this Christmas,"" he told the BBC. ""And, with certifications now also reflecting streams, as well as traditional physical and download sales, it is in with a strong chance of going platinum in its first week.""

What is my sin? Afghan interpreters blocked by UKFormer interpreters fear for their lives after the UK blocks their evacuation on security grounds.Asia,"British forces evacuated hundreds from Afghanistan in August Former Afghan interpreters for British forces have told the BBC they fear for their lives after the UK blocked their evacuation on security grounds. The move has stunned the group who thought getting out was a done deal. Sheltering in a hideout on the outskirts of Kabul, Abdul says he is waiting for the day he is found and killed by the Taliban. He is one of 11 Afghan interpreters the BBC has spoken to who have been stopped from relocating to the UK, despite initially being told they were eligible for a move. They received letters saying they were ""eligible for relocation"" to Britain under a government scheme to get former interpreters who had worked for British forces to safety. But the relocation was subject to passing immigration checks - and in the final stages, the Home Office blocked them on national security grounds. They were told their presence in the UK would not be ""conducive to the public good"". The men, whose names have been changed for their safety as they fear retribution from the Taliban, have not been given any details about why they were deemed a threat. They say they have done nothing wrong. Their supporters in the UK are calling for them to be given the opportunity to have their cases reviewed and have criticised the lack of transparency around the decisions. When officials from the UK's Ministry of Defence told him in July he was eligible to relocate, Abdul was relieved. Having worked in the past with British troops in Helmand, he was worried he would be a target for retribution when the Taliban started taking over Afghanistan. He says he was told to prepare for a flight out of the country within two weeks. He sold most of his possessions, and prepared to quit his job. But on 11 August, as the Taliban closed in on the capital, he received a letter telling him his visa application had been refused on ""national security"" grounds with no right of appeal. Abdul, a UN employee who also worked for the British embassy and for the Afghan government after leaving the army, was shocked by the decision. ""I have worked with the British embassy. And the UN has zero tolerance for misconduct,"" he says. A UN spokesperson confirmed to the BBC he had passed background checks for his work there as recently as 2019. ""I have never engaged in any criminal acts,"" Abdul says. ""But I have worked shoulder to shoulder with British soldiers."" While serving with British troops in Helmand Province, a commanding officer praised Abdul's ""loyalty, trustworthiness and complete professionalism"" in a service certificate. He now fears the Taliban will find and kill him, his wife, and his young children. ""I'm not even concerned about myself, I am concerned about my children. I'm worried about whether they will come back each day from school,"" he says. After hearing rumours that Taliban fighters were carrying out door-to-door searches, Abdul fled Kabul in late August with his family. ""I'm trying to do anything to get out of this situation. But we don't know where to go,"" he says. Another rejected interpreter, Sayed, has built a makeshift hideout in the bushes behind his home. He told his relatives to tell anyone who comes to his house that he is away. Once a week, after night falls, he takes a taxi into the city centre to buy food for his family. He has shown the BBC a Taliban death threat he says he received a decade ago. In it, the militants warn he will be sent ""to the depths of hell"" for ""working for the infidels"". Sayed is in hiding with his family After serving with the British, he worked for a firm contracted to the UN, and later a logistics company. He applied to the UK's Afghan Relocations and Assistance Policy (Arap) - a scheme allowing Afghans who worked for the British military and UK government to be able to move to the UK permanently. In April, he was told he was eligible for a move to the UK. But in August, days before Kabul fell to the Taliban, the Home Office told him he would pose a security threat because of his ""conduct, character and associations"". Sayed was perplexed. ""What is my sin?"" he asks. ""That I worked shoulder to shoulder with the British? I have no crime, I am not a criminal, I have done nothing wrong."" To add to the confusion, a fortnight later he received a Ministry of Defence email telling him to go to Kabul airport to be evacuated. But he was unable to make it through the chaos outside. Although the last Western military flights have left, he is still desperate to flee Afghanistan. ""We are still hoping for our fate, the fate of our children,"" he says. ""But I still feel so scared because these people will find me."" These stories, and those of nine others in a similar situation documented by the BBC, have prompted calls for the rejected cases to be reviewed. ""It's deeply, deeply disturbing to us,"" said Col Simon Diggins, formerly Britain's defence attachÃ© to Kabul, and now a campaigner for former Afghan staff. ""We have no faith in the process. The evidence is not seen. There is no opportunity to challenge the evidence and there's no appeal against it,"" he says. The Home Office did not want to comment on individual cases. But a government spokesperson told the BBC: ""There are people in Afghanistan who represent a serious threat to our national and public security. ""That is why thorough checks are taking place by government, our world-class intelligence agencies and others and if someone is assessed as presenting as a risk to our country, we will take action."" The UK, and other Western nations who are resettling Afghans, have been on high alert for possible abuses of the evacuation process. In August,a person on the UK's no-fly watch list was flown into Birminghamas part of the initial evacuation effort, although they were later not deemed a person of interest. And in the first half of September, the US government flagged 44 Afghans it had evacuated as security threats,according to the Washington Post,external. Fifteen of them have now been returned to sites in Europe and the Middle East. Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat - chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee - has called for clarity on how the decisions had been made. ""For every day that passes, the danger rises for the people we've promised to help,"" he said. ""There will be legitimate reasons why some cases are refused, but transparency as far as possible in the decision-making process will be important to avoid urgent cases falling through the cracks."" This video can not be played BBC catches up with Afghan journalist who gave emotional interview on the tarmac at Kabul airport Labour MP Diane Abbott, who sits on the Home Affairs Committee, said the interpreters should be able to appeal. ""Accepting refugees and then denying them is very odd. There may be grounds for this, but at the very least the Home Office has a duty to provide some transparency and to allow appeals. ""The people of Afghanistan have been treated very badly by this and previous governments. They must not compound that now by mistreating refugees."" Two interpreters who were deemed eligible but later blocked by the Home Office did manage to make it out of Afghanistan on Danish military flights. One of them, Ali, who worked with Danish as well as British troops, is now with his family in a city in eastern Denmark. After being told he was eligible for resettlement to the UK, he sold his house in Helmand Province. Ali has been allowed into Denmark despite being refused by the UK In the weeks that followed, he would check his emails first thing each morning, expecting news of a flight out of Kabul. ""When I saw the notification on my phone I was really excited,"" he recalls. ""But when I opened the message I was really shocked."" ""I couldn't sleep for four or five days - asking myself why they made this decision,"" he says. Ali - who later worked for the EU's police mission to Afghanistan - says he has no idea why the UK deemed him a security threat, but why Denmark allowed him to enter the country. Others have not been so fortunate. After being told in June he was eligible to relocate within weeks, Ahmad took out a $7,000 (Â£5,000) loan so he could make it to Kabul and travel on to the UK to start a new life. But on 16 August - just a day after the capital fell to the Taliban - he too was told he had been refused entry to the UK. Reading the Home Office letter, he says, was ""the worst moment in my life"". ""I asked why many times,"" he says. He wonders if he could have been deemed an extremist because of quotes from the Quran he has shared on Facebook, or because he hails from a Pashtun tribe that has traditionally had ties to the Taliban. Life under Taliban rule one month on 'Betrayed': The Afghans who feel left behind Ahmad decided to flee to Pakistan, taking a desert road to avoid Taliban checkpoints. When he made it to the border post, he managed to convince a Pakistani guard to let him through, claiming he needed medical treatment. He made it to a Pakistani border town, but he is too scared to go outside. He says the Taliban have threatened his family, and he doesn't know what to do next. ""When I surrender myself they will torture me, beat me,"" he says. ""Then they will hang me or shoot me.""

He applied to the UK's Afghan Relocations and Assistance Policy (Arap) - a scheme allowing Afghans who worked for the British military and UK government to be able to move to the UK permanently. In April, he was told he was eligible for a move to the UK. But in August, days before Kabul fell to the Taliban, the Home Office told him he would pose a security threat because of his ""conduct, character and associations"". Sayed was perplexed. ""What is my sin?"" he asks. ""That I worked shoulder to shoulder with the British? I have no crime, I am not a criminal, I have done nothing wrong."" To add to the confusion, a fortnight later he received a Ministry of Defence email telling him to go to Kabul airport to be evacuated. But he was unable to make it through the chaos outside. Although the last Western military flights have left, he is still desperate to flee Afghanistan. ""We are still hoping for our fate, the fate of our children,"" he says. ""But I still feel so scared because these people will find me."" These stories, and those of nine others in a similar situation documented by the BBC, have prompted calls for the rejected cases to be reviewed. ""It's deeply, deeply disturbing to us,"" said Col Simon Diggins, formerly Britain's defence attachÃ© to Kabul, and now a campaigner for former Afghan staff. ""We have no faith in the process. The evidence is not seen. There is no opportunity to challenge the evidence and there's no appeal against it,"" he says. The Home Office did not want to comment on individual cases. But a government spokesperson told the BBC: ""There are people in Afghanistan who represent a serious threat to our national and public security. ""That is why thorough checks are taking place by government, our world-class intelligence agencies and others and if someone is assessed as presenting as a risk to our country, we will take action."" The UK, and other Western nations who are resettling Afghans, have been on high alert for possible abuses of the evacuation process. In August,a person on the UK's no-fly watch list was flown into Birminghamas part of the initial evacuation effort, although they were later not deemed a person of interest. And in the first half of September, the US government flagged 44 Afghans it had evacuated as security threats,according to the Washington Post,external. Fifteen of them have now been returned to sites in Europe and the Middle East. Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat - chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee - has called for clarity on how the decisions had been made. ""For every day that passes, the danger rises for the people we've promised to help,"" he said. ""There will be legitimate reasons why some cases are refused, but transparency as far as possible in the decision-making process will be important to avoid urgent cases falling through the cracks."" This video can not be played BBC catches up with Afghan journalist who gave emotional interview on the tarmac at Kabul airport Labour MP Diane Abbott, who sits on the Home Affairs Committee, said the interpreters should be able to appeal. ""Accepting refugees and then denying them is very odd. There may be grounds for this, but at the very least the Home Office has a duty to provide some transparency and to allow appeals. ""The people of Afghanistan have been treated very badly by this and previous governments. They must not compound that now by mistreating refugees."" Two interpreters who were deemed eligible but later blocked by the Home Office did manage to make it out of Afghanistan on Danish military flights. One of them, Ali, who worked with Danish as well as British troops, is now with his family in a city in eastern Denmark. After being told he was eligible for resettlement to the UK, he sold his house in Helmand Province. Ali has been allowed into Denmark despite being refused by the UK In the weeks that followed, he would check his emails first thing each morning, expecting news of a flight out of Kabul. ""When I saw the notification on my phone I was really excited,"" he recalls. ""But when I opened the message I was really shocked."" ""I couldn't sleep for four or five days - asking myself why they made this decision,"" he says. Ali - who later worked for the EU's police mission to Afghanistan - says he has no idea why the UK deemed him a security threat, but why Denmark allowed him to enter the country. Others have not been so fortunate. After being told in June he was eligible to relocate within weeks, Ahmad took out a $7,000 (Â£5,000) loan so he could make it to Kabul and travel on to the UK to start a new life. But on 16 August - just a day after the capital fell to the Taliban - he too was told he had been refused entry to the UK. Reading the Home Office letter, he says, was ""the worst moment in my life"". ""I asked why many times,"" he says. He wonders if he could have been deemed an extremist because of quotes from the Quran he has shared on Facebook, or because he hails from a Pashtun tribe that has traditionally had ties to the Taliban. Life under Taliban rule one month on 'Betrayed': The Afghans who feel left behind Ahmad decided to flee to Pakistan, taking a desert road to avoid Taliban checkpoints. When he made it to the border post, he managed to convince a Pakistani guard to let him through, claiming he needed medical treatment. He made it to a Pakistani border town, but he is too scared to go outside. He says the Taliban have threatened his family, and he doesn't know what to do next.

"Rise in pregnant women needing Covid ICU treatmentMore than 20% of women admitted to intensive care for Covid since May were pregnant, a study finds.Scotland","The number of pregnant women needing intensive care has gone up despite overall ICU numbers going down More than 20% of women admitted to intensive care for Covid-19 since May 2021 were pregnant or had recently given birth, a study has found. A Scottish Intensive Care Audit Group report said 42 had been admitted since 18 May 2021, compared with 25 in the first two waves of the pandemic. The number has gone up despite overall intensive care numbers reducing. The Scottish government said vaccines were the best way to protect against the risks of Covid in pregnancy. The Scottish Intensive Care Audit Group (SICAG) report,externalfound that no deaths of pregnant women following ICU treatment had been reported up to 19 September 2021. The report counts pregnant women admitted to ICUs and women who were admitted within six weeks of giving birth. Admission to high dependency units, used for managing high risk pregnancies, were not included in the figures. In the first two waves of the pandemic in Scotland, between 1 March 2020 and 17 May 2021, 1,850 Covid patients were admitted to ICU, according to SICAG. Of this number, 630 were women and about 4% of them were pregnant or had recently given birth. Since 18 May 2021, 189 women have required intensive care treatment for Covid-19 and 22.2% of them have been pregnant. Dr Sarah Stock, a consultant in maternal and foetal medicine, said it was still uncertain what had caused the rise. ""It could be because a much lower proportion of pregnant women are vaccinated, or it could be because pregnant women are particularly susceptible to severe disease from the Delta variant that has predominated during the third wave - but we don't know for sure yet,"" she said. But Dr Stock, who is co-leadinga study into Covid-19 in pregnancy at the University of Edinburgh,external, told BBC Scotland there was ""really strong evidence"" that pregnant women were more likely than other women to be admitted to hospital and intensive care. ""We also know that although we've had no deaths in Scotland yet, data from around the world and in particular the United States has shown higher mortality rates with Covid-19 in pregnancy than in non-pregnant women,"" she said. The consultant said there was also evidence Covid-19 led to higher premature birth rates and probably caused more stillbirths as well. ""Being pregnant affects your response to infections. We know that pregnant women are more susceptible to viruses - and this is probably what we're seeing with Covid-19."" The SICAG study's authors said they had found ""very few"" critical care admissions among pregnant women during the first and second waves of the pandemic. The report continued: ""Wave three has seen increased numbers of pregnant women being admitted to hospital with moderate to severe Covid-19 symptoms requiring critical care. ""The majority of patients were pregnant on admission to critical care and 30% were admitted after delivery."" Most of the women lived in the most deprived areas of Scotland, the report added. The report also found that none of the women who required treatment in intensive care were fully vaccinated at the time of admission. A separate report by Public Health Scotland (PHS),external, published on 6 October, found vaccine take-up among pregnant women in Scotland was low across all age groups. PHS estimates that of the 77,679 women who were pregnant between December 2020 and August 2021, about 18% received at least a first dose. The over-40s have achieved the best level of vaccine coverage so far at 26.5%. The figure drops to 7% in the under-19s. Although younger age groups were vaccinated later in the roll-out programme, general coverage in all age groups apart from 12-17 year olds in August was above 70%. Dr Pat O'Brien, vice president of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, said a number of factors could be influencing the increase in ICU admission figures. For example, he said an increase in birth rates this year could lead to higher numbers in ICU, as a proportion of all pregnant women will always become severely ill from Covid-19. But he told BBC Scotland the ""key message"" was for pregnant women to make sure they were vaccinated. ""There is still a significant number of pregnant women being admitted to ICU with Covid. That's obviously bad for the woman, but it's also bad for the baby,"" he said. ""All of this is preventable by a vaccine that is perfectly safe to take in pregnancy."" Vaccination take-up among women is low across all age groups when compared with the rest of the population A Scottish government spokesperson said: ""It is clear from the report that unvaccinated people are considerably more likely to require ICU treatment, so it remains vital that everyone who is eligible takes up the offer of vaccination, as this will protect the NHS and save lives. ""This includes pregnant women, as vaccination is the best way of protecting against the risks of Covid in pregnancy.""

What is my sin? Afghan interpreters blocked by UK,"British forces evacuated hundreds from Afghanistan in August Former Afghan interpreters for British forces have told the BBC they fear for their lives after the UK blocked their evacuation on security grounds. The move has stunned the group who thought getting out was a done deal. Sheltering in a hideout on the outskirts of Kabul, Abdul says he is waiting for the day he is found and killed by the Taliban. He is one of 11 Afghan interpreters the BBC has spoken to who have been stopped from relocating to the UK, despite initially being told they were eligible for a move. They received letters saying they were ""eligible for relocation"" to Britain under a government scheme to get former interpreters who had worked for British forces to safety. But the relocation was subject to passing immigration checks - and in the final stages, the Home Office blocked them on national security grounds. They were told their presence in the UK would not be ""conducive to the public good"". The men, whose names have been changed for their safety as they fear retribution from the Taliban, have not been given any details about why they were deemed a threat. They say they have done nothing wrong. Their supporters in the UK are calling for them to be given the opportunity to have their cases reviewed and have criticised the lack of transparency around the decisions. When officials from the UK's Ministry of Defence told him in July he was eligible to relocate, Abdul was relieved. Having worked in the past with British troops in Helmand, he was worried he would be a target for retribution when the Taliban started taking over Afghanistan. He says he was told to prepare for a flight out of the country within two weeks. He sold most of his possessions, and prepared to quit his job. But on 11 August, as the Taliban closed in on the capital, he received a letter telling him his visa application had been refused on ""national security"" grounds with no right of appeal. Abdul, a UN employee who also worked for the British embassy and for the Afghan government after leaving the army, was shocked by the decision. ""I have worked with the British embassy. And the UN has zero tolerance for misconduct,"" he says. A UN spokesperson confirmed to the BBC he had passed background checks for his work there as recently as 2019. ""I have never engaged in any criminal acts,"" Abdul says. ""But I have worked shoulder to shoulder with British soldiers."" While serving with British troops in Helmand Province, a commanding officer praised Abdul's ""loyalty, trustworthiness and complete professionalism"" in a service certificate. He now fears the Taliban will find and kill him, his wife, and his young children. ""I'm not even concerned about myself, I am concerned about my children. I'm worried about whether they will come back each day from school,"" he says. After hearing rumours that Taliban fighters were carrying out door-to-door searches, Abdul fled Kabul in late August with his family. ""I'm trying to do anything to get out of this situation. But we don't know where to go,"" he says. Another rejected interpreter, Sayed, has built a makeshift hideout in the bushes behind his home. He told his relatives to tell anyone who comes to his house that he is away. Once a week, after night falls, he takes a taxi into the city centre to buy food for his family. He has shown the BBC a Taliban death threat he says he received a decade ago. In it, the militants warn he will be sent ""to the depths of hell"" for ""working for the infidels"". Sayed is in hiding with his family After serving with the British, he worked for a firm contracted to the UN, and later a logistics company.

Strike fears as Italy's workers require Covid pass,"Protests against the Green Pass began early on Friday outside the big Adriatic port of Trieste Dockers at three big ports have staged protests at the requirement for all Italian workers to show a Covid pass. The Green Pass shows whether you have had the Covid vaccine, recovered from it or had a negative test. It became mandatory for all workplaces on Friday. About 6,000 workers went on strike outside Trieste port, a maritime gateway for northern Italy, Germany, Austria and central Europe. There was disruption in Genoa and Ancona too, but dockers worked normally in Italy's other major ports at Venice, Palermo, Naples and Gioia Tauro, Ansa news agency reported. About three million Italian workers are estimated to be still unvaccinated and protests were reported in many of the big cities: In Trieste, where only 40% of 950 port workers have had the jab, protesters chanted anti-government slogans as well as ""No Green Pass"" Protesters blocked a key access road to Genoa's Sopraelevata road bridge, the main route from the centre to the west of the city Strikes affected companies including Electrolux and San Benedetto Two thousand people joined a demonstration in Bologna's central Piazza Maggiore Hundreds of protesters occupied the Piazza Santa Maria Novella in central Florence Similar numbers were reported in the Piazza Castello in Turin and a sit-in was planned at Rome's ancient Circus Maximus The move to make the Covid pass compulsory for workers is among the world's toughest anti-Covid measures. A worker without a Green Pass risks being suspended without pay and may be fined up to â¬1,500 (Â£1,270; $1,740). The pass, introduced in June, was already required for teachers and other school workers, for access to bars and restaurants and for leisure venues such as cinemas and football stadiums. There were protests outside the big port at Trieste, and in Genoa (pictured) Italy's coalition government, led by Mario Draghi, is extending it in the hope of avoiding another lockdown. Two-thirds of Italians consider it necessary, according to an Ipsos opinion poll this week. However, opponents rioted in Rome on 9 October. The far-right Forza Nuova party led violent protesters who vandalised the CGIL trade union building in Rome, during clashes with police. Overall more than 85% of Italians aged over 12 have had at least one jab, and officials said a further 1.2 million vaccinations had been carried out in the past week. ""It is time to stop the economy, which is perhaps the only way we can show this government that many people are struggling,"" port workers' spokesman Stefano Puzzer told Rai TV. ""We will carry on until the Green Pass goes."" On 9 October far-right opponents of the Green Pass clashed with Rome police Ministers have played down fears of chaos, citing the high rate of vaccination. But disruption could hit the transport sector too, as many lorry drivers are foreigners who are either unvaccinated or have had jabs not recognised by the European Medicines Agency. Umberto Ruggero of Italy's logistics association said 30%-40% of staff might not show up. He spoke of a ""perfect storm"", with the sector already suffering from chronic understaffing. Dock workers in Trieste had offered to call off their action if the government delayed making the Green Pass obligatory until the end of October, but that was rejected by Rome. Italy launched its Covid Green Pass - a digital certificate - in June Business lobby group Confindustria strongly supports the Green Pass. Italy was the first European country to suffer a healthcare crisis in the pandemic, and has had more than 130,000 Covid deaths. There are fears that Italy's pharmacies may not cope with the pressure of providing many more Covid tests under the new regime. Unions failed to secure free tests for workers - something also demanded by Matteo Salvini's nationalist League, which is in the government. Italy rolls out mandatory Covid 'green pass' rules What is the EU vaccine 'passport' and can I use it? Covid vaccines: How fast is worldwide progress? The League's Luca Zaia, governor of the heavily industrialised Veneto region in the north-east, warned that ""we will not be able to grant a swab every 48 hours to all the unvaccinated"".

"Shoppers start to use Â£100 contactless card limitBut retailers say it could take months to update terminals so people can spend up to Â£100 without a Pin.BusinessAustralia PM to attend COP26 summit after pressureScott Morrison had said he might skip the summit, reigniting criticism of Australia's climate vows.Australia","Contactless cards were initially designed for low-value purchases The spending limit on each use of a contactless card has now risen from Â£45 to Â£100 - but not every shop will accept the new payment threshold. Retailers say it could take months to update terminals before every shopper can spend up to Â£100, without the need to enter a four-digit Pin. The move aims to make purchases such as grocery shopping more convenient. But some warn it could lead to a rise in theft and one bank boss questioned whether shoppers want a higher limit. Some 60% of debit and credit card transactions in the UK were contactless in the first seven months of the year. These accounted for a total of 6.6 billion payments with a value of Â£81bn. The decision to increase the threshold was taken by the Treasury and the City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the decision would bring convenience for shoppers and a boost to the High Street following Covid lockdowns. Listen to the BBC podcast:5 Minutes On ... Cash - another nail in the coffin? When contactless card payments were introduced in 2007, the transaction limit was set at Â£10 and designed as an alternative to small change. The limit was raised gradually, to Â£15 in 2010, to Â£20 in 2012, and then to Â£30 in 2015. It was hurriedly increased to Â£45 last year as the pandemic accelerated a move away from cash. As the limit has increased, so has the frequency of its use. Despite sudden drops of all transactions during national lockdowns, the general trend has been continuing growth. That has come as consumers have been less likely to use banknotes and coins. The huge number of terminals which need to be updated means that Friday marks the first day of a gradual introduction of the new limit. ""It may take days, weeks, or even months for some retailers to make the necessary changes in their systems so that the new limit can take effect,"" said Andrew Cregan, payments policy adviser at the British Retail Consortium. ""Furthermore, some retailers may choose not to adopt the new contactless limit. As a result, customers will need to take care when making payments to check what the maximum contactless limit is for individual stores."" Rural vacuum for getting hold of cash Cash access as vital as running water, says Age UK Campaigners have been concerned that as card and digital payments become more prevalent, it could affect access to cash for those who still rely on it. FCA research found that a greater proportion of consumers were finding it difficult to cope with fewer retailers accepting cash during the pandemic. However, it found that eight out of 10 small and medium-sized businesses said they were ""very likely"" to accept cash over the next five years. Graham Farrell, professor of crime science at the University of Leeds, has warned about the ""huge increase"" in attractiveness of bag snatches and pickpocketing by teenage thieves, who could then spend more on a stolen card. Academic Graham Farrell says there are risks of rising crime Heco-authored a paper,externalpointing out that these young criminals could then go on to long-term criminal careers. A thief will now be able to spend more on an unreported stolen card before a Pin is demanded. FCA guidance suggests a cumulative Â£300 needs to be spent on contactless before a purchase is checked by a Pin, up from the previous recommended level of Â£130. Prof Farrell told the BBC a halfway house was needed. ""A solution that would balance both sides would be tap-and-Pin. You would have contactless tapping of the card on a machine, without the trouble of putting it in and out of the machine. You would use Pin codes to ensure security, therefore making the theft of the card - as the thieves do not have the Pin - less attractive,"" he said. Authorities have sought to allay any concerns about an increase in fraud, pointing out that there was no rise in the crime after the last increase in the payment limit. Fraudsters steal Â£4m a day as crime surges ""What's more, we have seen no material increase in fraudulent transactions in other countries where the contactless limit increased to the equivalent of Â£100 or above,"" a spokesman for the FCA said. Australia and Singapore have contactless limits of the equivalent of about Â£100, and Canada's is close to Â£150. Customers of a variety of banks can switch off the contactless function, or request a non-contactless card. Some - notably Lloyds Banking Group and Starling - will allow customers to set their own contactless limit via the banks' apps. Anne Boden, chief executive of Starling Bank, questioned whether consumers really wanted to be able to spend more on Pin-free transactions. ""Analysing our spending data we can see that there appears to be little demand for the increased contactless limit and that many would like to retain the same contactless limit or even reduce it,"" she said. Shoppers can spend more than Â£100 without a Pin using payment services on smartphones, although they include in-built security on the devices such as fingerprint authorisation.

LiveLiveTens of thousands may have been given wrong Covid result10 minutes ago,"NHS Test and Trace suspends Covid testing provided by a private laboratory in Wolverhampton amid fears up to 43,000 people were given the wrong result Dr Jenny Harries, the head of NHS Test and Trace, says it is not yet clear how or why the laboratory might have given incorrect results Harries adds there will be a ""serious incident investigation"" to ensure there are not problems at other testing laboratories Earlier, a mass testing site in Berkshire asked people who recently got a negative result to book another test It comes after reports that some people received negative PCR tests after testing positive using lateral flow devices But health officials say the problem is ""an isolated incident attributed to one laboratory"" and that they are investigating the cause Separately, travellers returning to England will be able to take cheaper lateral flow tests from 24 October Edited by Hamish Mackay We're bringing our live coverage to a close now, so here's a reminder of the main stories today: We'll be back on Monday with all the latest coronavirus news. In the meantime you can follow our main storyhereorvisit our front pagefor other news. Today's posts were written by Becky Morton and Hazel Shearing and edited by Hamish Mackay. The Scottish governmenthas requested military back-up for two NHS health boardsto relieve pressure ahead of the winter period. NHS Lanarkshire will receive three nurses, 45 medics, 12 general troops and three drivers, while 14 medics, two nurses and four additional personnel will be sent to NHS Borders. Both health boards have already halted all non-urgent procedures, blaming staff shortages and rising patient demand. It comes after soldiers were brought in tosupport the Scottish Ambulance Servicein September. A previously ""active"" and ""energetic"" GP has told the BBC she now has to use a wheelchair due to long Covid. Susannah Thompson, from Blyth, contracted coronavirus last year while working on the NHS frontline, and has since experienced long-lasting symptoms of the virus. The 41-year-old says she struggles to get out of bed and complete day-to-day tasks, but decided to start using a wheelchair to ""regain her independence"" and help others. This video can not be played Coronavirus: Blyth GP using wheelchair due to long Covid Prof Alan McNally, a microbiologist at the University of Birmingham, says he is ""astonished"" by the problems at the private laboratory in Wolverhampton and says they will be the result of ""appropriate controls not being used"". He tells the BBC he ""can't understand how itâs happened at this scale"". âIf you do that test properly with all appropriate controls then there is no way you should have missed sheer volume of false negative results we are talking about here,"" he says. âYou should see if you have this level of systematic failure."" He says it is a question of ""quality control and quality assurance, oversight and management"", adding: ""I cannot fathom the failings that would lead to this level of false negative results."" Boris Johnson was visiting a Rolls Royce factory in Bristol The prime minister says people should not be concerned after thousands may wrongly have been told their Covid tests were negativebecause of errors at a private lab. âWeâre looking into what went wrong with that particular testing centre, but is doesnât affect the overall numbers,"" Boris Johnson says. On a visit to Bristol, he tells reporters: ""Overall, the picture in the South West in the Bristol area and the rest of the country, remains very much where it has been for some time now. We are just getting along in a state of, more or less, an equilibrium."" He says that while there are quite high infection rates, particularly in young people ""that isn't really feeding through into the older generations in the way that we saw in previous spikes"". âThereâs no doubt that the wall of vaccination that the country has built is very high and very effective,"" he adds. He says the overall data shows the government is right to stick with its ""plan A"" for winter - meaning no additional restrictions are needed.  Helen Diggle, who lives in Tellisford in Somerset, says she
had five positive lateral flow tests and three negative PCRs before finally
testing positive for Covid on a PCR test. On one of her visits to a testing centre she said a member
of staff told her she had seen lots of very similar cases recently,
particularly involving local schools. Helen tells BBC News: âIt is really worrying that some
people in the system, people on the ground, have been aware that something is
going on.â When Helen and her 10-year-old daughter kept testing negative on PCRs despite high temperatures and positive lateral flow tests
she knew something was not right. âI was very conscious that by having all these tests I could
have been wasting NHS resources to satisfy my own conviction that I had Covid,"" she adds. âI felt like I was being unnecessarily neurotic.â But when her son tested positive on private PCR testing
equipment owned by his school, it was âblindingly obvious we all had Covid"", she says. Helen feels the situation is particularly unfair to
school children. âIf children test negative on PCR then schools have to take
children back,"" she says. âSo you probably have many more cases in school than they
are expected to deal with.â âI feel we have been short changed â particularly the
children â because testing is not working as it should be,"" she adds. ""My concern is it is leading not just the spread of the virus
but is eroding trust in the testing system.â Dr Harries is asked about a suggestion that officials in Wales - where some of the false results were - heard last week that there might be a problem with testing facilities. In response, she says it was ""very difficult to pinpoint exactly where it was"". ""We have been doing some really detailed investigations looking at the routes of travel of samples and of the types of samples, where they come from and who has been infected,"" she says. ""And obviously as soon as we got that information we worked with colleagues in Wales as well as other parts of the country."" She insists that ""the vast majority of tests throughout the UK have just been processed accurately and normally"". Wolverhampton Science Park, where the Immensa Health laboratory is based Dr Harries, who is also head of the UK Health Security Agency, says there will be ""a serious incident investigation"" within the organisation. ""I want to make sure if there are any further problems with other laboratories we can absolutely spot them as quickly as possible, so I will be conducting a serious incident investigation within the Health Security Agency to make sure we can mitigate any problems going forward,"" she says. She adds that the ""location of the laboratory combined with the geography and the time period"" of cases were key in allowing officials to spot the problem. Asked when officials first became aware of the issue, Dr Harries says there had been ""some feedback and some queries coming through over the last two or three weeks"" from public health directors in local communities. ""But itâs only in the last few days when we have dug right down into both the geography and the different type of tests coming back through and the different prevalence rates thatâs allowed us to pinpoint exactly what it is,"" she says. ""About half of these  cases are coming from the South West and that has allowed us to locate the laboratory."" Dr Harries says that anyone affected by the issue at the private laboratory in Wolverhampton will be contacted by NHS Test and Trace, with those whose tests have been processed in the past 10 days made a priority because they could still be infectious. ""We will be contacting by text message, by email... and will recommend they have another test,"" she says. But anyone whose tests were processed before then will still be contacted, she adds, because ""we clearly want to acknowledge that there has been a problem with that lab and just let them know"". Dr Harries adds that only a few thousand out of the 43,000 people affected by the wrong result could potentially be infectious now. âThe period of real infectivity is probably only reaching back about six or seven daysâ¦ so I think it will only be a few thousand people who will have positive tests in that total number,"" she says. ""It is very difficult to estimate. So we are obviously being cautious and just sending a message to all of them."" Dr Jenny Harries, the head of NHS Test and Trace, says it is ""not clear yet"" what went wrong in the private laboratory in Wolverhampton that has stopped operating due to fears people were given the wrong test results. She insists, however, that the ""rest of the system is working as normal"". Harries says that the laboratory is ""accredited to all of the appropriate standards"". It had been brought in to deal with an increase in surge testing from 8 September, and was also used during the surge in cases last winter. ""We are doing a detailed investigation with them, working on the actual processes within the laboratory â but the important thing of course is that we have suspended all of their services,"" she says. ""As soon as we establish what the problem is, then clearly we will have to look at that in detail. We will definitely not be using them until all of those processes are clear."" Covid-19 is continuing to spread around the world. The US, India and Brazil have seen the highest number of confirmed cases since the start of the pandemic, followed by the UK, Russia and Turkey. There have now been around 240 million confirmed cases since the start of the pandemic. Here's how that number has grown over time. The number of daily cases is stable or falling in most regions, except Europe.  China and India have given out the most vaccine doses, followed by the US. But when breaking the figures down by doses per 100 people in countries with a population of at least one million, Cuba, the United Arab Emirates and Uruguay top the list. Covid infections in England and Wales increased in the week to 9 October, according to the latest ONS estimates. Estimated infections were little changed in Northern Ireland but decreased in Scotland. The number of people with coronavirus for each nation is estimated to be: Just over one million people in the UK are estimated to have had Covid in the week to 9 October - the highest figure since the end of January, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). This is 1.5% of the population â or one in 65 people â up from one in 70 the previous week. The ONS survey is based on testing a random sample of people from private households. More than 20% of women admitted to intensive care for Covid-19 in Scotland since May 2021 were pregnant or had recently given birth, a study has found. A Scottish Intensive Care Audit Group report says 42 had been admitted since 18 May 2021, compared with 25 in the first two waves of the pandemic. The number has gone up despite overall intensive care numbers reducing. The Scottish government says vaccines are the best way to protect against the risks of Covid in pregnancy. Dr Stock, who is co-leadinga separate study into Covid-19 in pregnancy at the University of Edinburgh,external, tells BBC Scotland there is ""really strong evidence"" that pregnant women are more likely than other women to be admitted to hospital and intensive care. ""We also know that although we've had no deaths in Scotland yet, data from around the world and in particular the United States has shown higher mortality rates with Covid-19 in pregnancy than in non-pregnant women,"" she says. You can read more about the report here. Ted McSweeney says he has ""completely lost trust in the whole system"" after he received three negative PCR results at a testing site in Swindon, despite getting positive results from lateral flow tests. He only tested positive with a PCR test after using a home testing kit. After his first negative PCR result, Ted says he called NHS Test and Trace to ask for advice. ""They were happy for me to go back to work. But I had symptoms and I had a positive lateral flow test and said 'somethingâs not right here', so I booked another test,"" he says. He continued getting PCR tests for six days, but all came back negative. At this stage he had decided to isolate anyway, because he was ""sure"" he had the virus. After the third negative PCR, he contacted Test and Trace and was sent a home testing kit - that came back positive. He adds that he was then given conflicting information about when he could go back to work. ""Itâs made me lose faith in the whole system,"" he says. ""If they donât know, how do we know?"" In a statement, Wales' Health Minister Eluned Morgan says her government was made aware last week of the UK Health Security Agency's investigation into higher than expected numbers of positive lateral flow tests followed by negative PCR results. She says the issue is isolated to a private laboratory in Wolverhampton and does not involve the wider network, including the IP5 laboratory in Newport that processes the majority of
Welsh samples. Anyone
who had a test from 4 October and received a result from the affected
laboratory will be contacted by NHS Test and Trace and advised to get another test if their initial PCR result was negative. Close contacts who have symptoms will also be advised to book another test. People
who had a test processed at the laboratory between 8 September and 4 October
will also be contacted and advised to get a test if they have symptoms. The majority of those affected by the issue are in south-west England but some people in south-east England and an estimated 4,000 people in Wales may have been impacted. You can read more about the situation in Wales here. An estimated 4,000 Welsh residents may have been given inaccurate PCR results by the private laboratory in Wolverhampton, where NHS Test and Trace has suspended testing operations. In a statement, the Welsh government says the
majority of these tests would have been taken at testing sites across the Gwent
and Cwm Taf Morgannwg areas. If you receive a negative PCR test after a positive lateral flow result - and have not been contacted by NHS Test and Trace to say this may have been a false negative - the UK Health Security Agency says its advice remains the same as previously. It confirms to the BBC that individuals do not need to self-isolate in this case. It says anyone with Covid symptoms should book a PCR test and those with a positive lateral flow result should get a follow-up PCR test to confirm this. We've been speaking to more people who fear they may have been affected by false negative PCR test results. Graham Loader, from Newbury, believes his family are among those to receive incorrect results from the Newbury Showground testing site in West Berkshire. The council says the lab issue may affect those who took a PCR test at the site between 3 and 12 October. Three members of his family all had negative PCR results after positive lateral flow results in late September and early October. His 11-year-old son received a negative PCR result on 30 September, while his wife received a negative result on 1 October and he got one on 6 October. As a result, he tells the BBC he ""strongly suspects"" the dates given by the council are wrong. While his son didn't have any symptoms, Graham and his wife suffered tiredness and headaches. However, as they were not experiencing any of the three main Covid symptoms - a high temperature, continuous cough or change to their sense of smell or taste - they assumed the lateral flow tests must have been faulty. ""After getting the PCRs back weâve gone about our usual
business,"" Graham says. ""I completely trusted the PCR so I feel bad for all the
people Iâve been in contact with."" Meanwhile, away from the UK, vaccinated Australian citizens and the parents of residents will be able to visit Sydney from 1 November without the need to quarantine. Australia's borders have effectively been closed since March 2020, making it difficult even for citizens to enter. ""We are not opening up to everyone coming back to Australia at the moment,"" Prime Minister Scott Morrison says. He explains that priority will be given to Australians and family members, after which the nation will consider migrants, those with work and study visas and the ""challenge"" of tourists.

Adele's comeback single: Hit or Miss?,"This video can not be played Easy On Me is the first new music released by Adele in six years After a slow-burning PR campaign, Adele's first new music in six years has arrived. Easy On Me, a spare and emotional piano ballad, was released at midnight UK time, offering fans the first glimpse of her ""divorce album"", entitled 30. That will be her follow-up to massively successful albums 19, 21 and 25. Easy On Me sees Adele explaining her decision to walk away from her marriage in 2019, while asking her son and ex-husband for understanding. ""I changed who I was to put you both first,"" she sings, ""but now I give up"". That moment, so naked and unvarnished, sends shivers down your spine. Adele's voice is full of regret, but also resolve. 'Thank you, Adele - I got divorced young too' In the accompanying music video, director Xavier Dolan chooses this moment to transition from black and white to full colour - making clear that this is the sound of a woman who has dismantled her entire world, realising that she needn't feel guilty for putting herself first.

Adele addresses the chorus, ""go easy on me"", to herself as much as her family - and she accepts it's too soon for them to see her point of view. ""I had good intentions / And the highest hopes / But I know, right now / It probably doesn't even show."" The song was apparently the first track written for Adele's forthcoming album, and dates back to the year of her separation. The immediacy of those emotions is apparent in her vocal, simultaneously strong and vulnerable. But there's also a generosity to the song. Adele is reaching out to the people she's hurt, but Easy On Me is also a big woolly blanket wrapped around the loneliness and pain of anyone who's been through a core-shaking break-up. Adele says new album will explain divorce to son Adele finalises divorce with joint custody of son Adele sings and jokes about weight as she hosts SNL It's already proved to be a hit. Just under 300,000 people tuned in to watch the video premiere on YouTube. Within 12 hours it had been streamed 12 million times. The single comes just five weeks before her new album  - which was first teased in a global marketing campaign that saw the number 30 projected on to buildings and billboards in Brazil, Mexico, Dubai, Italy, Germany, Ireland, the US and the UK. Fans correctly guessed the release date of 19 November when Taylor Swift moved her forthcoming album forward by a week, apparently to avoid a clash with Adele. Easy On Me was co-written with Adele's frequent collaborator Greg Kurstin Like her previous three albums the title is a reference to a specific age in Adele's life. Thirty is the age at which she married her long-term partner, Simon Konecki, and then left him. The star has said the album was recorded to help her eight-year-old son understand their divorce the following year. ""I wanted to explain to him through this record, when he's in his 20s or 30s, who I am and why I voluntarily chose to dismantle his entire life in the pursuit of my own happiness,""she told Vogue magazine.,external ""It made him really unhappy sometimes. And that's a real wound for me that I don't know if I'll ever be able to heal,"" she added. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Speaking to BBC Radio 2's Zoe Ball, the singer said the album ""was bloody hard work to make"". ""I was singing things I didn't even realise I was feeling or thinking,"" she said, adding that it was important for her to share those emotions with the world. ""I feel like I can't unlock a door for my own mental health and take the key with me. I've got to leave it in the door for everyone else - and I'm in a strong place now where I feel like I can put that vulnerability out. Allow Twitter content?

In a separate interview with BBC Radio 1's Greg James, she admitted that her friends hadn't been too impressed by Easy On Me when she played them the demo. ""I sent a snippet of it, as I was writing it, to three of my closest friends,"" she said. ""One didn't like it, one was like, 'keep trying', and the other was like, 'I'm busy working'. So that was the perfect response."" BBC Sounds: Adele on Radio 1 Once it was finished, however, ""they loved it"". ""And I don't do any music in my time off. It's not a muscle that I exercise - writing or singing,"" she added. ""So most of the time, even just for my best friends and my manager, their first reaction, no matter what the song is, is, 'it's just nice to hear you sing'."" While Easy On Me is very much a traditional Adele ballad, there have been hints that the rest of the album will showcase a more experimental side to Adele's music. According to Vogue, one track features her vocals ""sampled and resampled over a hypnotic beat"", that is reminiscent of electro-pop act Goldfrapp. She has also worked with London-based producer Inflo - responsible for the retro R&B sounds of Michael Kiwanuka and Little Simz - as well as the Oscar-winning composer of the Black Panther score, Ludwig GÃ¶ransson. Radio 2 DJ Jo Whiley, who has been played a handful of the songs, said there are ""all kinds"" of sounds and genres on the album. ""There's one that I listened to and it just made me feel incredibly sad,"" she added. ""She really does pour her heart out and her voice, I think, has never sounded better. ""I was really surprised by the heights that she reaches - and the power and the resonance within her voice is amazing."" The music world meanwhile has been reacting to Adele's long-awaited return, with Canadian star Drake alerting his Instagram followers to the fact that ""one of my best friends in the world just dropped a single"". Solo star and former Fifth Harmony memberNormani declared,external: ""Adele oh Adele I love uuuuuuuu."" Elsewhere, Clueless film star Alicia Silverstone posted a humorous video on TikTok of her preparing to drown her sorrows while listening the London singer's latest heartfelt offering.

However it sounds, 30 is certain to be a shot in the arm for the UK music industry. Only one British album released since the start of 2020, Dua Lipa's Future Nostalgia, has sold the 300,000 copies required to be awarded a platinum disc. It took her 10 months to achieve that feat. By contrast, Adele's last album, 25, went platinum in its first 24 hours. It went on to become the UK's 14th best-selling album of all time, with sales in excess of 3.6 million. Sony, her new record label, will be hoping to match those sorts of sales heights - although the CD market has declined precipitously since 2015; and Adele's streaming numbers don't yet match those of her peers. She currently has 22 million monthly listeners on Spotify, compared to Ed Sheeran's 75 million and Taylor Swift's 46.5 million. New music will undoubtedly boost those figures, however, even if Adele faces stiff competition from Sheeran, Swift, Abba and Coldplay, who will all release new material in the coming weeks. Martin Talbot, chief executive of the Official Charts Company, described the pile-up as an ""embarrassment of riches"" that is almost unprecedented for the music retail sector - but he predicted Adele would emerge on top. ""It would be a brave man who predicted anything other than 30 being the biggest album of this Christmas,"" he told the BBC. ""And, with certifications now also reflecting streams, as well as traditional physical and download sales, it is in with a strong chance of going platinum in its first week.""

"Extra Â£5.5m in GP funding for 'challenging winter'Funding will be used to improve systems for ordering repeat prescriptions and freeing up phone lines.Northern IrelandBreaking|Breaking newsCovid test lab suspended over wrong resultsAround 43,000 people may have been wrongly told their test for Covid-19 was negative.Health","The Department of Health is making up to Â£5.5m available to support GP services in Northern Ireland over winter. Health Minister Robin Swann said he recognised the importance of people being able to access GP services. The funding will be used to improve technology and accessibility, and support patient care. Mr Swann said that services across health and social care were facing ""a challenging winter"". He has allocated Â£3.8m to support additional patient care during this time and up to Â£1.7m to further improve telephone and computer technology. He added that GP feedback showed that patients were presenting with more complex needs, making it difficult for GPs ""to see all the people they would wish to"". Department of Health figures show that GP practices are currently carrying out almost 200,000 consultations on a weekly basis. GP's 'distress' as patients complain about access Fall in GP surgery numbers in NI, report finds The health minister said that GP practices have been open throughout the pandemic and will continue to use both face-to-face appointments and alternative consultation options for patients. He said work was taking place to improve access to primary care for patients, including exploring how telephone systems could be better used to support services. He added that consideration was also being given to ways to better deal with routine requests, such as repeat prescriptions to release capacity. Robin Swann says that primary care services in NI were ""under increasing pressure"" before the pandemic ""This work is part of a wider programme to help improve patient access to services, which includes the wider rollout of primary care multi-disciplinary teams, and work to reform the out-of-hours service. ""I am committed to ensuring that we have a GP workforce that is supported, motivated and sustainable and that continues to provide quality care to patients when they need it."" He said work was taking place on a review of GP trainee places, to make sure there were ""enough GPs to meet our primary care needs into the future"". Londonderry GP Dr Nicola Duffy said she had asked the Department of Health to be allowed to see more patients in person. She said they were currently restricted by policy. She told BBC Radio Ulster 's Talkback programme that she was not allowed to see patients ""without social distancing, wearing a mask, regardless of whether I am vaccinated or not"". ""That is to protect the vulnerable patients that are using the health centre that I work in,"" she said. ""I am ready, my colleagues are ready. Could someone higher than me fix this, so we can get back to seeing our patients?"" Dr Alan Stout, chair of the British Medical Association of Northern Ireland, said he hoped the funding would help some of the immediate pressures that GPs were facing, ""as well as beginning to address some of the more systemic and complex issues, including the number of GP trainee places available"". Dr Alan Stout from the BMA said general practice has ""never closed"" ""General practice has not closed and never closed,"" he said. ""Consultation rates and the number of patients contacting their surgery continue to be high and the current system is struggling to cope. ""All of our staff are feeling the pressure and we recognise that the difficulty in access and delays in seeing your GP cause frustration to patients."" But will the extra money help to resolve the current difficulties many patients are facing when trying to get a face-to-face GP appointment? Dr Laurence Dorman, chair of the Royal College of General Practitioners Northern Ireland (RCGPNI), said the Â£5.5m was ""very welcome"" and would mean ""extra surgeries and extra colleagues"" to help meet patients' needs. However, he said it was ""short-term"" funding and what was really needed is longer-term financial support and more GPs to join the workforce. ""At the moment, there's no point putting an extra phone line into our surgery if we don't have a GP at the end of those lines to meet the needs of our patients,"" he explained. Dr Dorman also warned that Covid-19 continues to pose safety concerns in GP waiting rooms, particularly for vulnerable patients who need to attend surgeries for treatment. ""We're still in the middle of a pandemic and we have to work the way we do to meet infection control standards,"" he told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme. ""We simply not like hairdressers and shops - we have sick patients coming into our buildings.  We have patients who are taking blood tests, chemotherapy and we must be able to protect them,"" he said. ""We are seeing out patients face-to-face when it's appropriate and safe to do so, but we are still in a pandemic, we need our patients to work with us."" ""But if our patients need seen face-to-face, absolutely then their family doctor will do that."" Dr Laurence Dorman said GP were still seeing patients face-to-face when it was ""appropriate and safe to do so"" As well as his RCGPNI role, Dr Dorman works in a GP surgery in Kilkeel, County Down. Addressing complaints over the number of in person appointments being made available, he argued that GPs were working ""harder than ever"". Dr Dorman said the GP workforce was ""tired and exhausted"", adding that ""some of the negative criticism is really demoralising"". He argued that the increase in telephone consultations during the pandemic meant that family doctors were treating more patients than they had ever done before and were often able to provide a ""same-day"" service. He said GP services were undergoing an ""overall transformation"" like many parts of the health service, in an attempt to tailor services to patients' needs. ""This new way of working is actually suiting and working very well for some patients,"" he added. Dr Dorman said that pre-Covid, most patients frequently faced a two-week wait for a GP appointment, most of which were face-to-face. ""That didn't suit a lot of patients, particularly patients who worked, patients who had caring commitments, so these new ways of working which are going right across the health care system, right through to outpatients and so on, are important and necessary.""

Shoppers start to use Â£100 contactless card limitBut retailers say it could take months to update terminals so people can spend up to Â£100 without a Pin.Business,"Contactless cards were initially designed for low-value purchases The spending limit on each use of a contactless card has now risen from Â£45 to Â£100 - but not every shop will accept the new payment threshold. Retailers say it could take months to update terminals before every shopper can spend up to Â£100, without the need to enter a four-digit Pin. The move aims to make purchases such as grocery shopping more convenient. But some warn it could lead to a rise in theft and one bank boss questioned whether shoppers want a higher limit. Some 60% of debit and credit card transactions in the UK were contactless in the first seven months of the year. These accounted for a total of 6.6 billion payments with a value of Â£81bn. The decision to increase the threshold was taken by the Treasury and the City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the decision would bring convenience for shoppers and a boost to the High Street following Covid lockdowns. Listen to the BBC podcast:5 Minutes On ... Cash - another nail in the coffin? When contactless card payments were introduced in 2007, the transaction limit was set at Â£10 and designed as an alternative to small change. The limit was raised gradually, to Â£15 in 2010, to Â£20 in 2012, and then to Â£30 in 2015. It was hurriedly increased to Â£45 last year as the pandemic accelerated a move away from cash. As the limit has increased, so has the frequency of its use. Despite sudden drops of all transactions during national lockdowns, the general trend has been continuing growth. That has come as consumers have been less likely to use banknotes and coins. The huge number of terminals which need to be updated means that Friday marks the first day of a gradual introduction of the new limit. ""It may take days, weeks, or even months for some retailers to make the necessary changes in their systems so that the new limit can take effect,"" said Andrew Cregan, payments policy adviser at the British Retail Consortium. ""Furthermore, some retailers may choose not to adopt the new contactless limit. As a result, customers will need to take care when making payments to check what the maximum contactless limit is for individual stores."" Rural vacuum for getting hold of cash Cash access as vital as running water, says Age UK Campaigners have been concerned that as card and digital payments become more prevalent, it could affect access to cash for those who still rely on it. FCA research found that a greater proportion of consumers were finding it difficult to cope with fewer retailers accepting cash during the pandemic. However, it found that eight out of 10 small and medium-sized businesses said they were ""very likely"" to accept cash over the next five years. Graham Farrell, professor of crime science at the University of Leeds, has warned about the ""huge increase"" in attractiveness of bag snatches and pickpocketing by teenage thieves, who could then spend more on a stolen card. Academic Graham Farrell says there are risks of rising crime Heco-authored a paper,externalpointing out that these young criminals could then go on to long-term criminal careers. A thief will now be able to spend more on an unreported stolen card before a Pin is demanded. FCA guidance suggests a cumulative Â£300 needs to be spent on contactless before a purchase is checked by a Pin, up from the previous recommended level of Â£130. Prof Farrell told the BBC a halfway house was needed. ""A solution that would balance both sides would be tap-and-Pin. You would have contactless tapping of the card on a machine, without the trouble of putting it in and out of the machine. You would use Pin codes to ensure security, therefore making the theft of the card - as the thieves do not have the Pin - less attractive,"" he said. Authorities have sought to allay any concerns about an increase in fraud, pointing out that there was no rise in the crime after the last increase in the payment limit. Fraudsters steal Â£4m a day as crime surges ""What's more, we have seen no material increase in fraudulent transactions in other countries where the contactless limit increased to the equivalent of Â£100 or above,"" a spokesman for the FCA said. Australia and Singapore have contactless limits of the equivalent of about Â£100, and Canada's is close to Â£150. Customers of a variety of banks can switch off the contactless function, or request a non-contactless card. Some - notably Lloyds Banking Group and Starling - will allow customers to set their own contactless limit via the banks' apps. Anne Boden, chief executive of Starling Bank, questioned whether consumers really wanted to be able to spend more on Pin-free transactions. ""Analysing our spending data we can see that there appears to be little demand for the increased contactless limit and that many would like to retain the same contactless limit or even reduce it,"" she said. Shoppers can spend more than Â£100 without a Pin using payment services on smartphones, although they include in-built security on the devices such as fingerprint authorisation.

Fears for Afghan staff facing UK security block,"British forces evacuated hundreds from Afghanistan in August Former Afghan interpreters for British forces have told the BBC they fear for their lives after the UK blocked their evacuation on security grounds. The move has stunned the group who thought getting out was a done deal. Sheltering in a hideout on the outskirts of Kabul, Abdul says he is waiting for the day he is found and killed by the Taliban. He is one of 11 Afghan interpreters the BBC has spoken to who have been stopped from relocating to the UK, despite initially being told they were eligible for a move. They received letters saying they were ""eligible for relocation"" to Britain under a government scheme to get former interpreters who had worked for British forces to safety. But the relocation was subject to passing immigration checks - and in the final stages, the Home Office blocked them on national security grounds. They were told their presence in the UK would not be ""conducive to the public good"". The men, whose names have been changed for their safety as they fear retribution from the Taliban, have not been given any details about why they were deemed a threat. They say they have done nothing wrong. Their supporters in the UK are calling for them to be given the opportunity to have their cases reviewed and have criticised the lack of transparency around the decisions. When officials from the UK's Ministry of Defence told him in July he was eligible to relocate, Abdul was relieved. Having worked in the past with British troops in Helmand, he was worried he would be a target for retribution when the Taliban started taking over Afghanistan. He says he was told to prepare for a flight out of the country within two weeks. He sold most of his possessions, and prepared to quit his job. But on 11 August, as the Taliban closed in on the capital, he received a letter telling him his visa application had been refused on ""national security"" grounds with no right of appeal. Abdul, a UN employee who also worked for the British embassy and for the Afghan government after leaving the army, was shocked by the decision. ""I have worked with the British embassy. And the UN has zero tolerance for misconduct,"" he says. A UN spokesperson confirmed to the BBC he had passed background checks for his work there as recently as 2019. ""I have never engaged in any criminal acts,"" Abdul says. ""But I have worked shoulder to shoulder with British soldiers."" While serving with British troops in Helmand Province, a commanding officer praised Abdul's ""loyalty, trustworthiness and complete professionalism"" in a service certificate. He now fears the Taliban will find and kill him, his wife, and his young children. ""I'm not even concerned about myself, I am concerned about my children. I'm worried about whether they will come back each day from school,"" he says. After hearing rumours that Taliban fighters were carrying out door-to-door searches, Abdul fled Kabul in late August with his family. ""I'm trying to do anything to get out of this situation. But we don't know where to go,"" he says. Another rejected interpreter, Sayed, has built a makeshift hideout in the bushes behind his home. He told his relatives to tell anyone who comes to his house that he is away. Once a week, after night falls, he takes a taxi into the city centre to buy food for his family. He has shown the BBC a Taliban death threat he says he received a decade ago. In it, the militants warn he will be sent ""to the depths of hell"" for ""working for the infidels"". Sayed is in hiding with his family After serving with the British, he worked for a firm contracted to the UN, and later a logistics company. He applied to the UK's Afghan Relocations and Assistance Policy (Arap) - a scheme allowing Afghans who worked for the British military and UK government to be able to move to the UK permanently. In April, he was told he was eligible for a move to the UK. But in August, days before Kabul fell to the Taliban, the Home Office told him he would pose a security threat because of his ""conduct, character and associations"". Sayed was perplexed. ""What is my sin?"" he asks. ""That I worked shoulder to shoulder with the British? I have no crime, I am not a criminal, I have done nothing wrong."" To add to the confusion, a fortnight later he received a Ministry of Defence email telling him to go to Kabul airport to be evacuated. But he was unable to make it through the chaos outside. Although the last Western military flights have left, he is still desperate to flee Afghanistan. ""We are still hoping for our fate, the fate of our children,"" he says. ""But I still feel so scared because these people will find me."" These stories, and those of nine others in a similar situation documented by the BBC, have prompted calls for the rejected cases to be reviewed. ""It's deeply, deeply disturbing to us,"" said Col Simon Diggins, formerly Britain's defence attachÃ© to Kabul, and now a campaigner for former Afghan staff. ""We have no faith in the process. The evidence is not seen. There is no opportunity to challenge the evidence and there's no appeal against it,"" he says. The Home Office did not want to comment on individual cases. But a government spokesperson told the BBC: ""There are people in Afghanistan who represent a serious threat to our national and public security. ""That is why thorough checks are taking place by government, our world-class intelligence agencies and others and if someone is assessed as presenting as a risk to our country, we will take action."" The UK, and other Western nations who are resettling Afghans, have been on high alert for possible abuses of the evacuation process. In August,a person on the UK's no-fly watch list was flown into Birminghamas part of the initial evacuation effort, although they were later not deemed a person of interest. And in the first half of September, the US government flagged 44 Afghans it had evacuated as security threats,according to the Washington Post,external. Fifteen of them have now been returned to sites in Europe and the Middle East. Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat - chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee - has called for clarity on how the decisions had been made. ""For every day that passes, the danger rises for the people we've promised to help,"" he said. ""There will be legitimate reasons why some cases are refused, but transparency as far as possible in the decision-making process will be important to avoid urgent cases falling through the cracks."" This video can not be played BBC catches up with Afghan journalist who gave emotional interview on the tarmac at Kabul airport Labour MP Diane Abbott, who sits on the Home Affairs Committee, said the interpreters should be able to appeal. ""Accepting refugees and then denying them is very odd. There may be grounds for this, but at the very least the Home Office has a duty to provide some transparency and to allow appeals. ""The people of Afghanistan have been treated very badly by this and previous governments. They must not compound that now by mistreating refugees."" Two interpreters who were deemed eligible but later blocked by the Home Office did manage to make it out of Afghanistan on Danish military flights. One of them, Ali, who worked with Danish as well as British troops, is now with his family in a city in eastern Denmark. After being told he was eligible for resettlement to the UK, he sold his house in Helmand Province. Ali has been allowed into Denmark despite being refused by the UK In the weeks that followed, he would check his emails first thing each morning, expecting news of a flight out of Kabul. ""When I saw the notification on my phone I was really excited,"" he recalls. ""But when I opened the message I was really shocked."" ""I couldn't sleep for four or five days - asking myself why they made this decision,"" he says. Ali - who later worked for the EU's police mission to Afghanistan - says he has no idea why the UK deemed him a security threat, but why Denmark allowed him to enter the country. Others have not been so fortunate. After being told in June he was eligible to relocate within weeks, Ahmad took out a $7,000 (Â£5,000) loan so he could make it to Kabul and travel on to the UK to start a new life. But on 16 August - just a day after the capital fell to the Taliban - he too was told he had been refused entry to the UK. Reading the Home Office letter, he says, was ""the worst moment in my life"". ""I asked why many times,"" he says. He wonders if he could have been deemed an extremist because of quotes from the Quran he has shared on Facebook, or because he hails from a Pashtun tribe that has traditionally had ties to the Taliban. Life under Taliban rule one month on 'Betrayed': The Afghans who feel left behind Ahmad decided to flee to Pakistan, taking a desert road to avoid Taliban checkpoints. When he made it to the border post, he managed to convince a Pakistani guard to let him through, claiming he needed medical treatment. He made it to a Pakistani border town, but he is too scared to go outside. He says the Taliban have threatened his family, and he doesn't know what to do next. ""When I surrender myself they will torture me, beat me,"" he says. ""Then they will hang me or shoot me.""

Foreign drivers to be allowed more UK deliveriesMinisters want to lift the limit on how many deliveries overseas lorry drivers can make in the UK.,"The rules on the number of deliveries overseas lorry drivers can make in the UK are set to be relaxed in a bid to tackle supply chain problems in the run-up to Christmas. Under the new plans, drivers will be able to make unlimited deliveries or collections within a 14 day period. Currently EU drivers can only make two pick-ups or drop-offs each week. It is hoped the changes will happen by December - but UK drivers fear they might lose work to cheaper EU rivals. The UK's lorry driver shortage - due to a combination of Covid, Brexit and other factors - has affected petrol stations, supermarkets and left containers piled up at Felixstowe Port unable to be moved. Retailers have also warned there could be shortages of items such as toys at Christmas, with shoppers urged to buy gifts early. Why is there an HGV driver shortage? Toy shops warn of Christmas shortages amid delays 'We've run out of Harry Potter stock' Last month,the government announced it would grantup to 5,000 temporary visas for HGV drivers from abroad - but so far only a fraction have been issued. And the first foreign drivers brought in on the visa scheme may not even arrive for another month, sources have told BBC transport correspondent Carrie Davies. But now ministers are going further, andplan to make temporary changes to cabotage rules,,externalwhich govern how many jobs a haulier can make in a foreign country. It means foreign HGV drivers that come into the country laden with goods can pick up and drop off items an unlimited number of times for two weeks before they return home. The changes still need to be approved after a one-week consultation - but if passed they will come into force ""towards the end of this year for up to six months"", according to the government. It would mean thousands more HGV deliveries each month, the government said, so more goods - especially food and items that come via ports - can get delivered on schedule. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps told BBC Breakfast: ""Having some additional capacity right now... it is a good idea. This is a quick way of doing it. It doesn't require visas, it's just a common sense measure. ""It is one of very many things. I don't think it is going to undercut or suppress the market."" Mr Shapps said problems with supply chains were a global issue. He added: ""It is very tight but our supply chain is pretty robust. They have worked through coronavirus and they will work through this as well."" This video can not be played HGV driver shortage: Workers on their working conditions amid shortage But the haulage industry said the measures would undercut British operators. Rod McKenzie, from the Road Haulage Association, told BBC's Today programme: ""Well, I spoke to some of our members last night, and they were appalled. 'Ridiculous', 'pathetic', 'gobsmacked' were some of their more broadcastable comments. ""The government has been talking about a high-wage, high-skill economy, and not pulling the lever marked 'uncontrolled immigration', and to them this is exactly what it looks like. ""Allowing overseas haulage companies and drivers to come over for up to six months on a fortnightly basis to do unlimited work at low rates, undercutting UK hauliers whoâ¦ are facing an acute driver shortage, rising costs, staff wages. ""So this is about taking work from British operators and drivers and giving it to Europeans who don't pay tax here and pay peanuts to their drivers. ""We don't want cabotage [the transportation of goods in one country by operators from another] to sabotage our industry."" The Unite union has raised the prospect of possible industrial action in protest at what it sees as poor pay and conditions in the industry. ""The treatment of drivers across the board has been nothing short of a disgrace,"" said Unite general secretary Sharon Graham. ""As the prime minister said recently, the answer to the driver shortage is better wages and improved conditions. This is what we demand. ""Now is the time for action not words. It's time for employers to pay workers a proper rate for the job. ""Unite will be consulting its members before deciding on next steps, including exploring the options for industrial action."" Mr Shapps said the long-term answer to the supply chain issues ""must be developing a high-skill, high-wage economy here in the UK"". But talking about the latest measures, he said: ""The temporary changes we're consulting on to cabotage rules will also make sure foreign hauliers in the UK can use their time effectively and get more goods moving in the supply chain at a time of high demand."" According to France's finance minister, the UK is faring worse in the supply chain crisis because it left the single market after Brexit. ""We are facing the same situation,""said Bruno Le Maireat the G7 meeting in Washington. ""But the fact that we are a member of a very important single market helps us facing these bottlenecks."" On Thursday,the government said it was alsogiving hundreds of foreign abattoir workers temporary visas, to help fix the shortage of workers in slaughterhouses. The shortage of staff in abattoirs means pigs are not being killed fast enough, and there is not enough space on farms so farmers are having to kill them themselves. Farmers have already destroyed 6,600 healthy pigs due to a backlog on farms, the National Pig Association said.

The Scottish governmenthas requested military back-up for two NHS health boardsto relieve pressure ahead of the winter period. NHS Lanarkshire will receive three nurses, 45 medics, 12 general troops and three drivers, while 14 medics, two nurses and four additional personnel will be sent to NHS Borders. Both health boards have already halted all non-urgent procedures, blaming staff shortages and rising patient demand. It comes after soldiers were brought in tosupport the Scottish Ambulance Servicein September. A previously ""active"" and ""energetic"" GP has told the BBC she now has to use a wheelchair due to long Covid. Susannah Thompson, from Blyth, contracted coronavirus last year while working on the NHS frontline, and has since experienced long-lasting symptoms of the virus. The 41-year-old says she struggles to get out of bed and complete day-to-day tasks, but decided to start using a wheelchair to ""regain her independence"" and help others. This video can not be played Coronavirus: Blyth GP using wheelchair due to long Covid Prof Alan McNally, a microbiologist at the University of Birmingham, says he is ""astonished"" by the problems at the private laboratory in Wolverhampton and says they will be the result of ""appropriate controls not being used"". He tells the BBC he ""can't understand how itâs happened at this scale"". âIf you do that test properly with all appropriate controls then there is no way you should have missed sheer volume of false negative results we are talking about here,"" he says. âYou should see if you have this level of systematic failure."" He says it is a question of ""quality control and quality assurance, oversight and management"", adding: ""I cannot fathom the failings that would lead to this level of false negative results."" Boris Johnson was visiting a Rolls Royce factory in Bristol The prime minister says people should not be concerned after thousands may wrongly have been told their Covid tests were negativebecause of errors at a private lab. âWeâre looking into what went wrong with that particular testing centre, but is doesnât affect the overall numbers,"" Boris Johnson says. On a visit to Bristol, he tells reporters: ""Overall, the picture in the South West in the Bristol area and the rest of the country, remains very much where it has been for some time now. We are just getting along in a state of, more or less, an equilibrium."" He says that while there are quite high infection rates, particularly in young people ""that isn't really feeding through into the older generations in the way that we saw in previous spikes"". âThereâs no doubt that the wall of vaccination that the country has built is very high and very effective,"" he adds. He says the overall data shows the government is right to stick with its ""plan A"" for winter - meaning no additional restrictions are needed.  Helen Diggle, who lives in Tellisford in Somerset, says she
had five positive lateral flow tests and three negative PCRs before finally
testing positive for Covid on a PCR test. On one of her visits to a testing centre she said a member
of staff told her she had seen lots of very similar cases recently,
particularly involving local schools. Helen tells BBC News: âIt is really worrying that some
people in the system, people on the ground, have been aware that something is
going on.â When Helen and her 10-year-old daughter kept testing negative on PCRs despite high temperatures and positive lateral flow tests
she knew something was not right. âI was very conscious that by having all these tests I could
have been wasting NHS resources to satisfy my own conviction that I had Covid,"" she adds. âI felt like I was being unnecessarily neurotic.â But when her son tested positive on private PCR testing
equipment owned by his school, it was âblindingly obvious we all had Covid"", she says. Helen feels the situation is particularly unfair to
school children. âIf children test negative on PCR then schools have to take
children back,"" she says. âSo you probably have many more cases in school than they
are expected to deal with.â âI feel we have been short changed â particularly the
children â because testing is not working as it should be,"" she adds. ""My concern is it is leading not just the spread of the virus
but is eroding trust in the testing system.â Dr Harries is asked about a suggestion that officials in Wales - where some of the false results were - heard last week that there might be a problem with testing facilities. In response, she says it was ""very difficult to pinpoint exactly where it was"". ""We have been doing some really detailed investigations looking at the routes of travel of samples and of the types of samples, where they come from and who has been infected,"" she says. ""And obviously as soon as we got that information we worked with colleagues in Wales as well as other parts of the country."" She insists that ""the vast majority of tests throughout the UK have just been processed accurately and normally"". Wolverhampton Science Park, where the Immensa Health laboratory is based Dr Harries, who is also head of the UK Health Security Agency, says there will be ""a serious incident investigation"" within the organisation. ""I want to make sure if there are any further problems with other laboratories we can absolutely spot them as quickly as possible, so I will be conducting a serious incident investigation within the Health Security Agency to make sure we can mitigate any problems going forward,"" she says. She adds that the ""location of the laboratory combined with the geography and the time period"" of cases were key in allowing officials to spot the problem. Asked when officials first became aware of the issue, Dr Harries says there had been ""some feedback and some queries coming through over the last two or three weeks"" from public health directors in local communities. ""But itâs only in the last few days when we have dug right down into both the geography and the different type of tests coming back through and the different prevalence rates thatâs allowed us to pinpoint exactly what it is,"" she says. ""About half of these  cases are coming from the South West and that has allowed us to locate the laboratory."" Dr Harries says that anyone affected by the issue at the private laboratory in Wolverhampton will be contacted by NHS Test and Trace, with those whose tests have been processed in the past 10 days made a priority because they could still be infectious. ""We will be contacting by text message, by email... and will recommend they have another test,"" she says. But anyone whose tests were processed before then will still be contacted, she adds, because ""we clearly want to acknowledge that there has been a problem with that lab and just let them know"". Dr Harries adds that only a few thousand out of the 43,000 people affected by the wrong result could potentially be infectious now. âThe period of real infectivity is probably only reaching back about six or seven daysâ¦ so I think it will only be a few thousand people who will have positive tests in that total number,"" she says. ""It is very difficult to estimate. So we are obviously being cautious and just sending a message to all of them."" Dr Jenny Harries, the head of NHS Test and Trace, says it is ""not clear yet"" what went wrong in the private laboratory in Wolverhampton that has stopped operating due to fears people were given the wrong test results. She insists, however, that the ""rest of the system is working as normal"". Harries says that the laboratory is ""accredited to all of the appropriate standards"". It had been brought in to deal with an increase in surge testing from 8 September, and was also used during the surge in cases last winter. ""We are doing a detailed investigation with them, working on the actual processes within the laboratory â but the important thing of course is that we have suspended all of their services,"" she says. ""As soon as we establish what the problem is, then clearly we will have to look at that in detail. We will definitely not be using them until all of those processes are clear."" Covid-19 is continuing to spread around the world. The US, India and Brazil have seen the highest number of confirmed cases since the start of the pandemic, followed by the UK, Russia and Turkey. There have now been around 240 million confirmed cases since the start of the pandemic. Here's how that number has grown over time. The number of daily cases is stable or falling in most regions, except Europe.  China and India have given out the most vaccine doses, followed by the US. But when breaking the figures down by doses per 100 people in countries with a population of at least one million, Cuba, the United Arab Emirates and Uruguay top the list. Covid infections in England and Wales increased in the week to 9 October, according to the latest ONS estimates. Estimated infections were little changed in Northern Ireland but decreased in Scotland. The number of people with coronavirus for each nation is estimated to be: Just over one million people in the UK are estimated to have had Covid in the week to 9 October - the highest figure since the end of January, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). This is 1.5% of the population â or one in 65 people â up from one in 70 the previous week. The ONS survey is based on testing a random sample of people from private households. More than 20% of women admitted to intensive care for Covid-19 in Scotland since May 2021 were pregnant or had recently given birth, a study has found. A Scottish Intensive Care Audit Group report says 42 had been admitted since 18 May 2021, compared with 25 in the first two waves of the pandemic. The number has gone up despite overall intensive care numbers reducing. The Scottish government says vaccines are the best way to protect against the risks of Covid in pregnancy. Dr Stock, who is co-leadinga separate study into Covid-19 in pregnancy at the University of Edinburgh,external, tells BBC Scotland there is ""really strong evidence"" that pregnant women are more likely than other women to be admitted to hospital and intensive care. ""We also know that although we've had no deaths in Scotland yet, data from around the world and in particular the United States has shown higher mortality rates with Covid-19 in pregnancy than in non-pregnant women,"" she says.

Ted McSweeney says he has ""completely lost trust in the whole system"" after he received three negative PCR results at a testing site in Swindon, despite getting positive results from lateral flow tests. He only tested positive with a PCR test after using a home testing kit. After his first negative PCR result, Ted says he called NHS Test and Trace to ask for advice. ""They were happy for me to go back to work. But I had symptoms and I had a positive lateral flow test and said 'somethingâs not right here', so I booked another test,"" he says. He continued getting PCR tests for six days, but all came back negative. At this stage he had decided to isolate anyway, because he was ""sure"" he had the virus. After the third negative PCR, he contacted Test and Trace and was sent a home testing kit - that came back positive. He adds that he was then given conflicting information about when he could go back to work. ""Itâs made me lose faith in the whole system,"" he says. ""If they donât know, how do we know?"" In a statement, Wales' Health Minister Eluned Morgan says her government was made aware last week of the UK Health Security Agency's investigation into higher than expected numbers of positive lateral flow tests followed by negative PCR results. She says the issue is isolated to a private laboratory in Wolverhampton and does not involve the wider network, including the IP5 laboratory in Newport that processes the majority of
Welsh samples. Anyone
who had a test from 4 October and received a result from the affected
laboratory will be contacted by NHS Test and Trace and advised to get another test if their initial PCR result was negative. Close contacts who have symptoms will also be advised to book another test. People
who had a test processed at the laboratory between 8 September and 4 October
will also be contacted and advised to get a test if they have symptoms. The majority of those affected by the issue are in south-west England but some people in south-east England and an estimated 4,000 people in Wales may have been impacted. You can read more about the situation in Wales here. An estimated 4,000 Welsh residents may have been given inaccurate PCR results by the private laboratory in Wolverhampton, where NHS Test and Trace has suspended testing operations. In a statement, the Welsh government says the
majority of these tests would have been taken at testing sites across the Gwent
and Cwm Taf Morgannwg areas. If you receive a negative PCR test after a positive lateral flow result - and have not been contacted by NHS Test and Trace to say this may have been a false negative - the UK Health Security Agency says its advice remains the same as previously. It confirms to the BBC that individuals do not need to self-isolate in this case. It says anyone with Covid symptoms should book a PCR test and those with a positive lateral flow result should get a follow-up PCR test to confirm this. We've been speaking to more people who fear they may have been affected by false negative PCR test results. Graham Loader, from Newbury, believes his family are among those to receive incorrect results from the Newbury Showground testing site in West Berkshire. The council says the lab issue may affect those who took a PCR test at the site between 3 and 12 October. Three members of his family all had negative PCR results after positive lateral flow results in late September and early October. His 11-year-old son received a negative PCR result on 30 September, while his wife received a negative result on 1 October and he got one on 6 October. As a result, he tells the BBC he ""strongly suspects"" the dates given by the council are wrong. While his son didn't have any symptoms, Graham and his wife suffered tiredness and headaches. However, as they were not experiencing any of the three main Covid symptoms - a high temperature, continuous cough or change to their sense of smell or taste - they assumed the lateral flow tests must have been faulty. ""After getting the PCRs back weâve gone about our usual
business,"" Graham says. ""I completely trusted the PCR so I feel bad for all the
people Iâve been in contact with."" Meanwhile, away from the UK, vaccinated Australian citizens and the parents of residents will be able to visit Sydney from 1 November without the need to quarantine. Australia's borders have effectively been closed since March 2020, making it difficult even for citizens to enter. ""We are not opening up to everyone coming back to Australia at the moment,"" Prime Minister Scott Morrison says. He explains that priority will be given to Australians and family members, after which the nation will consider migrants, those with work and study visas and the ""challenge"" of tourists.

Foreign hauliers to be allowed more UK deliveries,"The rules on the number of deliveries overseas lorry drivers can make in the UK are set to be relaxed in a bid to tackle supply chain problems in the run-up to Christmas. Under the new plans, drivers will be able to make unlimited deliveries or collections within a 14 day period. Currently EU drivers can only make two pick-ups or drop-offs each week. It is hoped the changes will happen by December - but UK drivers fear they might lose work to cheaper EU rivals. The UK's lorry driver shortage - due to a combination of Covid, Brexit and other factors - has affected petrol stations, supermarkets and left containers piled up at Felixstowe Port unable to be moved. Retailers have also warned there could be shortages of items such as toys at Christmas, with shoppers urged to buy gifts early. Why is there an HGV driver shortage? Toy shops warn of Christmas shortages amid delays 'We've run out of Harry Potter stock' Last month,the government announced it would grantup to 5,000 temporary visas for HGV drivers from abroad - but so far only a fraction have been issued. And the first foreign drivers brought in on the visa scheme may not even arrive for another month, sources have told BBC transport correspondent Carrie Davies. But now ministers are going further, andplan to make temporary changes to cabotage rules,,externalwhich govern how many jobs a haulier can make in a foreign country. It means foreign HGV drivers that come into the country laden with goods can pick up and drop off items an unlimited number of times for two weeks before they return home. The changes still need to be approved after a one-week consultation - but if passed they will come into force ""towards the end of this year for up to six months"", according to the government. It would mean thousands more HGV deliveries each month, the government said, so more goods - especially food and items that come via ports - can get delivered on schedule. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps told BBC Breakfast: ""Having some additional capacity right now... it is a good idea. This is a quick way of doing it. It doesn't require visas, it's just a common sense measure. ""It is one of very many things. I don't think it is going to undercut or suppress the market."" Mr Shapps said problems with supply chains were a global issue. He added: ""It is very tight but our supply chain is pretty robust. They have worked through coronavirus and they will work through this as well."" This video can not be played HGV driver shortage: Workers on their working conditions amid shortage But the haulage industry said the measures would undercut British operators. Rod McKenzie, from the Road Haulage Association, told BBC's Today programme: ""Well, I spoke to some of our members last night, and they were appalled. 'Ridiculous', 'pathetic', 'gobsmacked' were some of their more broadcastable comments. ""The government has been talking about a high-wage, high-skill economy, and not pulling the lever marked 'uncontrolled immigration', and to them this is exactly what it looks like. ""Allowing overseas haulage companies and drivers to come over for up to six months on a fortnightly basis to do unlimited work at low rates, undercutting UK hauliers whoâ¦ are facing an acute driver shortage, rising costs, staff wages. ""So this is about taking work from British operators and drivers and giving it to Europeans who don't pay tax here and pay peanuts to their drivers. ""We don't want cabotage [the transportation of goods in one country by operators from another] to sabotage our industry."" The Unite union has raised the prospect of possible industrial action in protest at what it sees as poor pay and conditions in the industry. ""The treatment of drivers across the board has been nothing short of a disgrace,"" said Unite general secretary Sharon Graham. ""As the prime minister said recently, the answer to the driver shortage is better wages and improved conditions. This is what we demand. ""Now is the time for action not words. It's time for employers to pay workers a proper rate for the job. ""Unite will be consulting its members before deciding on next steps, including exploring the options for industrial action."" Mr Shapps said the long-term answer to the supply chain issues ""must be developing a high-skill, high-wage economy here in the UK"". But talking about the latest measures, he said: ""The temporary changes we're consulting on to cabotage rules will also make sure foreign hauliers in the UK can use their time effectively and get more goods moving in the supply chain at a time of high demand."" According to France's finance minister, the UK is faring worse in the supply chain crisis because it left the single market after Brexit. ""We are facing the same situation,""said Bruno Le Maireat the G7 meeting in Washington. ""But the fact that we are a member of a very important single market helps us facing these bottlenecks."" On Thursday,the government said it was alsogiving hundreds of foreign abattoir workers temporary visas, to help fix the shortage of workers in slaughterhouses. The shortage of staff in abattoirs means pigs are not being killed fast enough, and there is not enough space on farms so farmers are having to kill them themselves. Farmers have already destroyed 6,600 healthy pigs due to a backlog on farms, the National Pig Association said.

LiveLiveTravel changes a major step forward - airlines9 minutes ago,"NHS Test and Trace suspends Covid testing provided by a private laboratory in Wolverhampton amid fears up to 43,000 people were given the wrong result Dr Jenny Harries, the head of NHS Test and Trace, says it is not yet clear how or why the laboratory might have given incorrect results Harries adds there will be a ""serious incident investigation"" to ensure there are not problems at other testing laboratories Earlier, a mass testing site in Berkshire asked people who recently got a negative result to book another test It comes after reports that some people received negative PCR tests after testing positive using lateral flow devices But health officials say the problem is ""an isolated incident attributed to one laboratory"" and that they are investigating the cause Separately, travellers returning to England will be able to take cheaper lateral flow tests from 24 October Edited by Hamish Mackay We're bringing our live coverage to a close now, so here's a reminder of the main stories today: We'll be back on Monday with all the latest coronavirus news. In the meantime you can follow our main storyhereorvisit our front pagefor other news. Today's posts were written by Becky Morton and Hazel Shearing and edited by Hamish Mackay. The Scottish governmenthas requested military back-up for two NHS health boardsto relieve pressure ahead of the winter period. NHS Lanarkshire will receive three nurses, 45 medics, 12 general troops and three drivers, while 14 medics, two nurses and four additional personnel will be sent to NHS Borders. Both health boards have already halted all non-urgent procedures, blaming staff shortages and rising patient demand. It comes after soldiers were brought in tosupport the Scottish Ambulance Servicein September. A previously ""active"" and ""energetic"" GP has told the BBC she now has to use a wheelchair due to long Covid. Susannah Thompson, from Blyth, contracted coronavirus last year while working on the NHS frontline, and has since experienced long-lasting symptoms of the virus. The 41-year-old says she struggles to get out of bed and complete day-to-day tasks, but decided to start using a wheelchair to ""regain her independence"" and help others. This video can not be played Coronavirus: Blyth GP using wheelchair due to long Covid Prof Alan McNally, a microbiologist at the University of Birmingham, says he is ""astonished"" by the problems at the private laboratory in Wolverhampton and says they will be the result of ""appropriate controls not being used"". He tells the BBC he ""can't understand how itâs happened at this scale"". âIf you do that test properly with all appropriate controls then there is no way you should have missed sheer volume of false negative results we are talking about here,"" he says. âYou should see if you have this level of systematic failure."" He says it is a question of ""quality control and quality assurance, oversight and management"", adding: ""I cannot fathom the failings that would lead to this level of false negative results."" Boris Johnson was visiting a Rolls Royce factory in Bristol The prime minister says people should not be concerned after thousands may wrongly have been told their Covid tests were negativebecause of errors at a private lab. âWeâre looking into what went wrong with that particular testing centre, but is doesnât affect the overall numbers,"" Boris Johnson says. On a visit to Bristol, he tells reporters: ""Overall, the picture in the South West in the Bristol area and the rest of the country, remains very much where it has been for some time now. We are just getting along in a state of, more or less, an equilibrium."" He says that while there are quite high infection rates, particularly in young people ""that isn't really feeding through into the older generations in the way that we saw in previous spikes"". âThereâs no doubt that the wall of vaccination that the country has built is very high and very effective,"" he adds. He says the overall data shows the government is right to stick with its ""plan A"" for winter - meaning no additional restrictions are needed.  Helen Diggle, who lives in Tellisford in Somerset, says she
had five positive lateral flow tests and three negative PCRs before finally
testing positive for Covid on a PCR test. On one of her visits to a testing centre she said a member
of staff told her she had seen lots of very similar cases recently,
particularly involving local schools. Helen tells BBC News: âIt is really worrying that some
people in the system, people on the ground, have been aware that something is
going on.â When Helen and her 10-year-old daughter kept testing negative on PCRs despite high temperatures and positive lateral flow tests
she knew something was not right. âI was very conscious that by having all these tests I could
have been wasting NHS resources to satisfy my own conviction that I had Covid,"" she adds. âI felt like I was being unnecessarily neurotic.â But when her son tested positive on private PCR testing
equipment owned by his school, it was âblindingly obvious we all had Covid"", she says. Helen feels the situation is particularly unfair to
school children. âIf children test negative on PCR then schools have to take
children back,"" she says. âSo you probably have many more cases in school than they
are expected to deal with.â âI feel we have been short changed â particularly the
children â because testing is not working as it should be,"" she adds. ""My concern is it is leading not just the spread of the virus
but is eroding trust in the testing system.â Dr Harries is asked about a suggestion that officials in Wales - where some of the false results were - heard last week that there might be a problem with testing facilities. In response, she says it was ""very difficult to pinpoint exactly where it was"". ""We have been doing some really detailed investigations looking at the routes of travel of samples and of the types of samples, where they come from and who has been infected,"" she says. ""And obviously as soon as we got that information we worked with colleagues in Wales as well as other parts of the country."" She insists that ""the vast majority of tests throughout the UK have just been processed accurately and normally"". Wolverhampton Science Park, where the Immensa Health laboratory is based Dr Harries, who is also head of the UK Health Security Agency, says there will be ""a serious incident investigation"" within the organisation. ""I want to make sure if there are any further problems with other laboratories we can absolutely spot them as quickly as possible, so I will be conducting a serious incident investigation within the Health Security Agency to make sure we can mitigate any problems going forward,"" she says. She adds that the ""location of the laboratory combined with the geography and the time period"" of cases were key in allowing officials to spot the problem. Asked when officials first became aware of the issue, Dr Harries says there had been ""some feedback and some queries coming through over the last two or three weeks"" from public health directors in local communities. ""But itâs only in the last few days when we have dug right down into both the geography and the different type of tests coming back through and the different prevalence rates thatâs allowed us to pinpoint exactly what it is,"" she says. ""About half of these  cases are coming from the South West and that has allowed us to locate the laboratory."" Dr Harries says that anyone affected by the issue at the private laboratory in Wolverhampton will be contacted by NHS Test and Trace, with those whose tests have been processed in the past 10 days made a priority because they could still be infectious. ""We will be contacting by text message, by email... and will recommend they have another test,"" she says. But anyone whose tests were processed before then will still be contacted, she adds, because ""we clearly want to acknowledge that there has been a problem with that lab and just let them know"". Dr Harries adds that only a few thousand out of the 43,000 people affected by the wrong result could potentially be infectious now. âThe period of real infectivity is probably only reaching back about six or seven daysâ¦ so I think it will only be a few thousand people who will have positive tests in that total number,"" she says. ""It is very difficult to estimate. So we are obviously being cautious and just sending a message to all of them."" Dr Jenny Harries, the head of NHS Test and Trace, says it is ""not clear yet"" what went wrong in the private laboratory in Wolverhampton that has stopped operating due to fears people were given the wrong test results. She insists, however, that the ""rest of the system is working as normal"". Harries says that the laboratory is ""accredited to all of the appropriate standards"". It had been brought in to deal with an increase in surge testing from 8 September, and was also used during the surge in cases last winter. ""We are doing a detailed investigation with them, working on the actual processes within the laboratory â but the important thing of course is that we have suspended all of their services,"" she says. ""As soon as we establish what the problem is, then clearly we will have to look at that in detail. We will definitely not be using them until all of those processes are clear.""

'We've run out of Harry Potter stock',"House of Spells co-owner Elvijs Plugis says many Harry Potter wands and some clothing merchandise items are out of stock across the UK Delays at UK ports are having a severe impact on retailers, who are warning that customers might not be able find the same range of products this Christmas as they may have in previous years. We talk to four firms to find out how it's affecting them. There is currently a shortage across the country affecting official Harry Potter merchandise, two retailers have told the BBC. ""First Brexit hit, and then the pandemic hit. The combination of both, the manufacturers got scared and work stopped and they couldn't ship big containers by sea,"" Elvijs Plugis, co-owner of fandom-themed collectible shop House of Spells, based in Charing Cross, London, says. ""A Harry Potter wand used to be Â£20, now it's going to be Â£35-Â£40. All of the shops are running out of stock."" Many of the wands, other official movie replicas and some of clothing merchandise are currently difficult to source, he says. Mr Plugis added that House of Spells is now trying to focus on other fandoms as well as Harry Potter, although the business is still buying up as many licensed Harry Potter-themed product lines as it can find. ""Today at 8am in the morning, we received calls from the official Platform 9 and 3/4 shop [in Kings Cross Station] referring customers to us as they have run out of stock,"" he says. Typically, House of Spells makes a 20-30% margin on each wand it sells, but now the shop also has to pay another 25-30% in container shipping costs, as well as up to 30% more on customs charges. ""At the moment we have not raised prices - we don't know how long it will be possible though,"" says Mr Plugis. London Toy Company director Joel Berkowitz currently has 35,000 toys held up at ports London Toy Company, which imports Harry Potter toys, as well as designing its own British-themed toys for familiar brands, says it has now sold out of all of its stock of Harry Potter products. Container prices are up 900% for the firm, according to London Toy Company's director Joel Berkowitz. The firm now has 35,000 toys held up at ports, worth a quarter of a million pounds. ""We've had to redirect containers shipping around 10,000 toys, which would have gone straight to Felixstowe, to Tilbury Port in London, via France and Belgium,"" he says. ""It's adding a 2.5-3 week addition to the timeframe [of when customers will receive products]."" London Toy Company makes toys for brands such as the London Underground, JCB and several military museums across the UK. Currently, its clients, including retailers like Amazon, Audi, Harrods and Moonpig, are all waiting to receive orders of toys. ""We are having to absorb the extra costs as much as we can and take a hit on our margin,"" says Mr Berkowitz. ""There's a ceiling for the products that clients are willing to pay, so we're putting only a maximum of 10% on top of the cost of the product."" Toytown managing director Alan Simpson says it's a good idea to shop early this Christmas Alan Simpson, managing director of Toytown, a chain of independent retailers based in Belfast, is urging customers to start their Christmas shopping early this year. ""If you're looking for choice, don't expect to come in December and see what you would normally experience in a toy store,"" he tells the BBC. ""I have 42 years in business [but] I cannot remember ever having to come through any issues like this that we've been dealing with."" He says that although Toytown can try to pre-empt some of the price rises to help mitigate them, the problem is ""right across the board"", affecting many retailers. Mr Simpson uses the example of a toy construction truck: In October 2020, it cost 70p to ship from the Far East to the UK. Today, it costs Â£7 to ship. The truck currently sells for Â£15, but he says the price will need to rise soon, as almost half of the retail price is now taken up by shipping costs. ""Come January, all suppliers are going to have to increase prices again, having [already] increased them in June, July and August this year,"" he says, stressing that there is likely be an effect on inflation. ""They're feeling the impact because they get the product from the same sources that we do."" Lighting company Houseof co-founder Michael Jones says his firm is paying a 'heavy price' for not foreseeing shipping delays Other retailers who also rely on products being manufactured on the other side of the world are now gravely concerned, like London-based lighting company Houseof. The firm says it is now being charged Â£14,000 per container - double the price last year, and seven times the cost compared to prior to the pandemic. ""Our containers are now being redirected to the northern ports, as Southampton, Felixstowe and London Gateway are all congested with static empty containers,"" says Houseof co-founder Michael Jones. ""This increases our road transport costs significantly."" He added that Houseof was also having to book road transportation for goods up to five weeks in advance - often before the container even leaves China. ""Given that it takes between 60-90 days to produce an order, we are paying a heavy price for slow communication and poor forecasting,"" he says. ""Orders with retail partners are level with this time last year, but overall stock reserves are much lower, which will have implications as we enter the 'peak season'.""

Ikea warns stock shortages to last into next year,"Ikea, the Swedish furniture giant, says it expects the disruption to global supply chains to continue for at least another year. Chief executive Jesper Brodin said while there had been some improvement, there was still congestion at ports which has led to supply problems. ""We need to live with disturbances for the year to come,"" he said. The owner of Poundland has also predicted that pressure from supply chain problems will last into 2022. Andy Bond, chief executive of PepCo, which owns Poundland, said that its shipping costs had soared. ""There are some times where we have had to pay 10 times our normal rates,"" he said. ""That's not to say every day but that has been the impact."" Mr Bond said the retailer had good levels of stock for Christmas and did not expect to increase prices to cope with rising shipping costs. But he said: ""I think that we see the next 12 months remaining challenging."" Mr Brodin, chief executive of Ingka, which operates the majority of Ikea's stores, told the BBC that the UK and other countries were suffering with ""congestion in ports and disturbances in supply chains"". ""There is no easy fix to any of this even if people are working hard across not only Ikea but also across the world,"" he said. Last month, Ikea said it was struggling to supply 10% of its stock, or around 1,000 product lines including mattresses, to its 22 stores in the UK and Ireland amid the continuing shortage of HGV drivers. Meanwhile, earlier this week, it emerged that the key British commercial port of Felixstowe was suffering from logjams of shipping containers because of the busy Christmas period and a deficit of lorry drivers to shift them. Port delays: 'We've run out of Harry Potter stock' Why even huge ships can't fix the shipping crisis Ikea struggles to supply 1,000 product lines Ikea has been forced to purchase additional shipping containers and charter vessels to address product shortages. A spokeswoman for Ikea told the BBC last month: ""We have also sent goods by train from China to Europe and we have invested in temporary intermediate warehouses in China, Vietnam, India, Indonesia, and Thailand to support production."" Mr Brodin said: ""One thing we have learned is it is difficult to predict. You need to be on it every day and find the best solutions. ""At the same time from a realistic point, we need to live with disturbances for the year to come but things will gradually get better, I'm sure."" On Wednesday, shipping giant Maersk told the BBCit was re-routing some of its biggest ships away from the Port of Felixstowe, due to a logjam of shipping containers. Felixstowe is the UK's busiest container port Lars Mikael Jensen, head of global ocean network at Maersk, told BBC Radio 5 Live's Drive programme that some of its largest 20,000-container ships were waiting outside Felixstowe, the UK's biggest container port, for between four to seven days. ""We've taken those measures because we saw, because of the big ships, there is a limit to how many berths they can call in Felixstowe, and because its slower, it took longer to handle every ship,"" he said. ""Instead of wasting time waiting, we progressed to the next stop, and arranged that the boxes are relayed from that port rather than wait for a week and then discharge."" But on Thursday afternoon, the BBC understands that Maersk apologised to the government for the comments, which led to widespread concern about Felixstowe's capacity to receive and process goods. The BBC has seen details of a conversation between the government and the shipping company. It's understood that Maersk told the government that Lars Mikael Jensen, head of Maersk's east-west network, had said in a press briefing that Felixstowe was experiencing congestion. Mr Jenson had mentioned that one ship was diverted to Rotterdam where the cargo was offloaded to a smaller ship. Maersk said that there is not a specific plan to divert ships from Felixstowe now or in the near future and that traffic is managed dynamically. The company also said they are making decisions for other European ports. Maersk is also understood to have said that they are bringing in 25% more boxes to the UK between July to September, than the same period last year. Ikea revealed that, over the year to 31 August, sales rose by 6.3% to â¬37.4bn (Â£31.6bn). Mr Brodin said that when the Covid pandemic first hit last year, the group was forced to speed up a plan to invest in a strategy to meet customer needs and take on ""the new competition"", in particular ramping up its online operation. He said that what the company had planned as a two-year transformation was rolled out in two months. Mr Brodin said dealing with the pandemic ""is definitely a challenging time in so many ways"". He said the increase in annual sales was the one he was ""most proud of"" during his 25 years with the company. ""We have experienced the demand on life at home like never before in every market, since, of course, people have been in the same situation - confined to the four walls of their home.""

"Strike fears as Italy's workers require Covid passThe pass is already used widely, but port and transport workers are angry it is now mandatory.Europe","Protests against the Green Pass began early on Friday outside the big Adriatic port of Trieste Dockers at three big ports have staged protests at the requirement for all Italian workers to show a Covid pass. The Green Pass shows whether you have had the Covid vaccine, recovered from it or had a negative test. It became mandatory for all workplaces on Friday. About 6,000 workers went on strike outside Trieste port, a maritime gateway for northern Italy, Germany, Austria and central Europe. There was disruption in Genoa and Ancona too, but dockers worked normally in Italy's other major ports at Venice, Palermo, Naples and Gioia Tauro, Ansa news agency reported. About three million Italian workers are estimated to be still unvaccinated and protests were reported in many of the big cities: In Trieste, where only 40% of 950 port workers have had the jab, protesters chanted anti-government slogans as well as ""No Green Pass"" Protesters blocked a key access road to Genoa's Sopraelevata road bridge, the main route from the centre to the west of the city Strikes affected companies including Electrolux and San Benedetto Two thousand people joined a demonstration in Bologna's central Piazza Maggiore Hundreds of protesters occupied the Piazza Santa Maria Novella in central Florence Similar numbers were reported in the Piazza Castello in Turin and a sit-in was planned at Rome's ancient Circus Maximus The move to make the Covid pass compulsory for workers is among the world's toughest anti-Covid measures. A worker without a Green Pass risks being suspended without pay and may be fined up to â¬1,500 (Â£1,270; $1,740). The pass, introduced in June, was already required for teachers and other school workers, for access to bars and restaurants and for leisure venues such as cinemas and football stadiums. There were protests outside the big port at Trieste, and in Genoa (pictured) Italy's coalition government, led by Mario Draghi, is extending it in the hope of avoiding another lockdown. Two-thirds of Italians consider it necessary, according to an Ipsos opinion poll this week. However, opponents rioted in Rome on 9 October. The far-right Forza Nuova party led violent protesters who vandalised the CGIL trade union building in Rome, during clashes with police. Overall more than 85% of Italians aged over 12 have had at least one jab, and officials said a further 1.2 million vaccinations had been carried out in the past week. ""It is time to stop the economy, which is perhaps the only way we can show this government that many people are struggling,"" port workers' spokesman Stefano Puzzer told Rai TV. ""We will carry on until the Green Pass goes."" On 9 October far-right opponents of the Green Pass clashed with Rome police Ministers have played down fears of chaos, citing the high rate of vaccination. But disruption could hit the transport sector too, as many lorry drivers are foreigners who are either unvaccinated or have had jabs not recognised by the European Medicines Agency. Umberto Ruggero of Italy's logistics association said 30%-40% of staff might not show up. He spoke of a ""perfect storm"", with the sector already suffering from chronic understaffing. Dock workers in Trieste had offered to call off their action if the government delayed making the Green Pass obligatory until the end of October, but that was rejected by Rome. Italy launched its Covid Green Pass - a digital certificate - in June Business lobby group Confindustria strongly supports the Green Pass. Italy was the first European country to suffer a healthcare crisis in the pandemic, and has had more than 130,000 Covid deaths. There are fears that Italy's pharmacies may not cope with the pressure of providing many more Covid tests under the new regime. Unions failed to secure free tests for workers - something also demanded by Matteo Salvini's nationalist League, which is in the government.
