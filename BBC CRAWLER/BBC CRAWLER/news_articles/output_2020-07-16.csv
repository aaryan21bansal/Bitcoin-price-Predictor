"Spain to cull almost 100,000 mink in Covid scare","Mink are bred at farms for their prized fur (file photo) Almost 100,000 mink at a farm in north-eastern Spain are to be culled after many of them tested positive for coronavirus, health authorities say. The outbreak in AragÃ³n province was discovered after a farm employee's wife contracted the virus in May. Her husband and six other farm workers have since tested positive for the disease. The mink, bred for their prized fur, were isolated and monitored closely after the workers became infected. But when tests on 13 July showed that 87% of the mink were infected, health authorities ordered for all 92,700 of the semi-aquatic animals to be culled. Authorities said financial compensation will be given to the company that runs the farm, based in a village 200 km (125 miles) east of Madrid. Along with Madrid and Catalonia, AragÃ³n is one of the coronavirus hotspots in Spain, where more than 250,000 infections and 28,000 deaths have been recorded since the start of the pandemic. Fear over rise in animal-to-human diseases Why are we catching more diseases from animals? Joaquin Olona, AragÃ³n's minister of agriculture, told reporters on Thursday that the decision to cull the mink was taken ""to avoid the risk of human transmission"". Mr Olona stressed that it was not clear if ""transmission was possible from animals to humans and vice versa"". But one possibility, he said, was that an infected farm worker unwittingly transmitted the disease to the animals. Another unsubstantiated theory was that the animals passed on the disease to workers, he said. There have now been more than a million cases of the virus in farmed mink in Europe, with studies underway to look at how and why it's gained such a foothold. It's been known for a while that mink can catch the infection. And the conditions in a mink farm are such that the disease can spread quickly from one animal to another. Covid-19 had its origins in the animal kingdom. There are now many opportunities for animals to be exposed through contact with humans carrying the virus. Mink farmers were alerted to the problem when their animals fell sick. Conservationists are concerned that if the virus were to cross into wildlife, we might not notice for a while. And Covid-19 could be catastrophic for endangered animals, such as gorillas and chimps. Studies have shown that the virus is contagious among certain animals, including cats and dogs. Less is understood about the possibility of animal-to-human transmission, however, with researchers studying the risk. There have been other cases of workers testing positive for coronavirus at mink farms in Denmark and the Netherlands, both major producers of the animal's fur. Calls to shut down 'dirty fur trade' after mink cases In the Netherlands, tens of thousands of mink have been slaughtered in recent months after outbreaks were discovered at farms across the country. The move came after the Dutch government said it had found two suspected cases of farm workers being infected by the animals in May. Tens of thousands of mink have been culled in the Netherlands after coronavirus outbreaks The World Health Organization (WHO) said the infections could be the ""first known cases of animal-to-human transmission"" since the coronavirus pandemic began in China. At a news conference in June,WHO epidemiologist Maria van Kerkhove said,external""there were individuals who infected the minks, people who infected the mink and in turn some of these mink infected some people"". ""We are learning about what this actually means in terms of transmission and what role they [mink] may play,"" Dr van Kerkhove said. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself?

Â£3bn to help NHS prepare for possible second wave,"The NHS in England will get an extra Â£3bn of funding to prepare for a possible second wave of coronavirus, Boris Johnson has announced. The funding will also help ease winter pressures on the health service, Downing Street said. It followswarnings a second wave this winter could see as many as 120,000 Covid-19 deaths in UK hospitals. The prime minister made the funding commitment at a No 10 briefing, where he also pledged a new testing target. Capacity will be increased to at least 500,000 tests a day by the end of October, Mr Johnson said. Confirming the extra Â£3bn in funding for the NHS in England, he said Covid-19 could become ""more virulent"" in winter. The prime minister said: ""Demand for testing is not the only challenge that winter will bring. It's possible that the virus will be more virulent in the winter months and it's certain that the NHS will face the usual annual winter pressures."" He added: ""We're making sure we're ready for winter and planning for the worst."" Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will also receive additional funds, Mr Johnson added. Meanwhile, Health Secretary Matt Hancockhas called for an urgent reviewinto how coronavirus deaths have been recorded in England. Is a second wave of coronavirus on the way? How close to developing a vaccine are we? How can I get a coronavirus test? Downing Street said the new NHS funding would be available immediately and would allow the NHS to continue using additional private hospital capacity and maintain the temporary Nightingale hospitals until the end of March 2021. This will provide additional capacity for coronavirus patients, as well as allowing the NHS to carry out routine treatments and procedures, No 10 said. Non-urgent operations were suspended as the UK went into lockdown, to free up hospital beds during the first wave of coronavirus - but in May NHS England told hospitals they should restart procedures. In normal times an announcement of Â£3bn to help the NHS in England cope with winter pressures might look generous. But these are not normal times as the government pumps tens of billions into the economy to soften the blows of the coronavirus crisis. The head of NHS England, Sir Simon Stevens, has been in talks with the Treasury to get guarantees that the Nightingale hospitals can stay open through until next spring in case there is another Covid surge. He also wanted secure funding in place to do a deal with private hospitals to help tackle the backlog of cancelled non urgent operations such as hip and knee replacements. That money now seems to have been secured, though we await further details. The question is, will this be enough to get the health service through what could be one of the most difficult winters in its history? There have been predictions that the waiting list for routine surgery will swell to 10 million as fears of a second wave of Covid cases in the depths of winter won't go away. Highlighting other measures to protect the NHS as it heads into the winter, Mr Johnson said the government would carry out the biggest flu vaccination programme in the history of the health service, while supplies of personal protective equipment (PPE) and ventilators had also increased. The announcement was made as the prime ministerannounced a further easing of lockdown measures. The prime minister encouraged people to return to using public transport, while advice for employers will change from 1 August. From the beginning of next month, Mr Johnson said employers would have more discretion to bring staff back to the workplace providing it was safe to do so. Since late March the government had been advising people to work from home if possible to help curb coronavirus. Last week Mr Johnson had signalled a change, saying: ""I think we should now say, well, 'Go back to work if you can'."" But the UK's chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, told MPs on Thursdaythere was ""absolutely no reason"" to change the government's current guidanceon working from home. Sir Patrick wore a mask as he spoke to the Commons Science and Technology Committee on Thursday SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? 40,000 DEATHS:Could they have been prevented? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? Earlier this week a report, requested by Sir Patrick, called for immediate action to reduce the risks posed by a second wave of coronavirus this winter. Among its recommendations were increasing the capacity of thetest and trace programmeand having more people vaccinated against flu. Asked to model a ""reasonable"" worst-case scenario, scientists suggested a range of between 24,500 and 251,000 virus-related deaths in hospitals alone, peaking in January and February. The estimate does not take into account any lockdowns, treatments or vaccines. This video can not be played What factors determine a potential second wave of Covid-19 infections? Research suggests the virus can survive longer in colder conditions and is more likely to spread when people spend more time indoors. Experts are also concerned the NHS will be under extreme pressure, not just from a resurgence of coronavirus but also from seasonal flu and a backlog of regular, non-coronavirus workload. The British Medical Association chairman, Chaand Nagpaul, has called for more detail on how the Â£3bn funding will be used. ""The government talks of winter planning, but we need transparency on this, including how far this money can stretch in tackling a modelled worst-case forecast - including a second peak, additional non-Covid demand and a possible flu outbreak,"" Dr Nagpaul said. ""Crucially, the government must make prevention a priority and take every necessary step to try and avoid a national second spike all together."" NHS Providers, which represents hospitals and other NHS organisations, echoed the call for clarity over what the money will be used for, saying funding is already in place for Nightingale hospitals and private beds. While welcoming the financial support, deputy chief executive Saffron Cordery added: ""Trusts need more than that. They have got to recover the lost ground of the last four or five months and put measures in place to manage the additional activity that always happens in winter.""

'No reason' to change home working advice,"Sir Patrick wore a reusable mask to the session in Parliament There is ""absolutely no reason"" to change the guidance on working from home, the UK's chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance has said. Since late March the government has advised people to work from home if possible to help curb coronavirus. But last week Prime Minister Boris Johnson signalled a change, saying: ""I think we should now say, well, 'Go back to work if you can.'"" Sir Patrick said home working was still a ""perfectly good option"" for many. Speaking to the Commons science and technology committee, he said it was his view - and one shared by the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) - that distancing measures were still important for containing the virus. ""Of the various distancing measures, working from home for many companies remains a perfectly good option because it's easy to do,"" he said. ""I think a number of companies think it's actually not detrimental to productivity. And in that situation, there's absolutely no reason I can see to change it."" It comes as the government continues to try to balance the economic and health risks of the pandemic. UK payrolls shrink by 649,000 jobs in lockdown What's the future for the office? How many confirmed cases are there in your area? Asked about Britain's response to the virus, Sir Patrick said: ""It's clear that the outcome has not been good in the UK, I think you can be absolutely clear about that. ""There are many factors that are going to play in this as we look and say, 'what is it that makes some countries having done worse than others?', and there will be decisions made that will turn out not to have been the right decisions at the time."" In mid-March, Sir Patrick said it would be a ""good outcome"" for the UK if the number of deaths from the virus could be kept below 20,000. The latest figures show 45,119 people have died after testing positive for coronavirus in the UK, up by 66 on the previous day. Sir Patrick said it was ""quite probable"" that the virus will come back ""in different waves over a number of years"", but stressed the UK was still going through the first wave. ""When people talk about second wave now, actually, what I think they're talking about really is a re-emergence of the first wave,"" he said. ""All we have done is suppressed the first wave and when you take the brakes off you would expect it to come back."" It comes after a report, requested by the scientific adviser, suggestedthe UK could see about 120,000 new coronavirus deathsduring this winter. This could be seen as ""the tail end of the first wave still"", he said. During the session, Sir Patrick told MPs the government was advised to implement lockdown measures earlier than they did. In the run up to lockdown, he said steps were taken to mitigate the virus, including isolating households and advising against visiting pubs and theatres which caused ""quite extreme"" changes in behaviour. But he said after data suggested the number of virus cases was doubling every three days, Sage recommended - either on 16 or 18 March - that the ""remainder"" of measures to curb coronavirus should be introduced. Speaking in the Commons afterwards, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: ""16 March is the day when I came to this House and said that all unnecessary social contact should cease - that is precisely when the lockdown was started."" Labour MP Zarah Sultana said that ""advising people to socially distance is not the same as imposing a lockdown. That week-long delay could have cost thousands of lives"". In June,former government adviser Prof Neil Ferguson saidthe number of coronavirus deaths in the UK would have been halved if lockdown had been introduced a week earlier. The beginning of lockdown has usually been dated to the evening of 23 March when Prime Minister Boris Johnson addressed the nation and people were told to mostly avoid leaving home and all non-essential shops were closed. In fact, Mr Hancock has previously said that is when lockdown began. In a debate in the Commons on 2 June, he noted that the daily death figures were ""lower than at any time since lockdown began on 23 March"". BBC health correspondent James Gallagher said: ""A key piece of evidence came out on Monday 16 Marchwhich showed that250,000 people could die. ""That night, the government advised people to avoid pubs and work from home if possible. On Wednesday schools were told they would close at the end of the week. ""On Friday, all restaurants, pubs, clubs and indoor sport and leisure facilities were ordered to shut. The UK was then put into full lockdown the following Monday."" Sir Patrick also said there was no assumption that a vaccine for coronavirus would be available in the immediate future, afterencouraging early results from clinical trialsraised hopes of finding one. ""Our assumption is we won't have it and when we get it we will be thrilled,"" he said. Conservative MP Mark Logan asked Sir Patrick about his face covering, which he wore as he entered the session but took off while giving evidence. ""It's a fairly standard cloth face covering,"" he said. ""It's got a nose thing to make sure it doesn't slip off my nose and it's got several layers."" Foggy glasses, recycling, kids: Your guide to wearing a mask Coronavirus: How to make your own face mask Asked how long he would wear it for and whether he washes it, Sir Patrick said: ""I think you should wear them for short periods. As I say, I don't think it's something you can wear all day in indoor environments - there's some evidence for that. ""And yes, like my other clothes, I wash it.""

Leicester lockdown measures eased after cases drop,"This video can not be played Some lockdown measures in Leicester will be partially relaxed, the health secretary announces. A stricter lockdown in Leicester will be eased after a drop in coronavirus cases, Matt Hancock has said. The health secretary told the House of Commons some restrictions would be lifted from 24 July ""but not all"" following a prolonged lockdown. The city remained under strict measures from 29 June after a spike in cases. Restrictions on schools and nurseries will be lifted but bars remain closed as virus rates ""still remain well above the national average"", Mr Hancock said. The secretary of state said the latest data showed the seven-day infection rate in Leicester was now 119 cases per 100,000 people - down from 135 when the prolonged lockdown was announced. The local lockdown was announced on 29 June A new local power will be used to close shops selling non-essential items where necessary. Bars and restaurants in the city will still not be allowed to open and the ban on non-essential travel and social gatherings of more six people will remain in force. Despite announcing schools can reopen, those run by the city and county council have already closed for the summer. Mr Hancock said: ""Some say that the local lockdown is unnecessary. ""I wish this were true, but sadly it remains vital for the health of everyone in Leicester and the rest of the country that these restrictions stay in place. ""We will review them again in a fortnight. I hope that this careful easing of restrictions will provide some comfort to people in Leicester and Leicestershire."" Michelle Teale (right) has not seen her 85-year-old mother for 20 weeks Michelle Teale, who has incurable breast cancer, said she was upset the announcement made no mention of people still ""shielding"" in the city. In his 29 June announcement, the health secretary said the nationwide relaxation of shielding measures on 6 July would not apply to Leicester. ""Each week that goes by is another week taken away from me,"" she said. ""Yet again, he [Matt Hancock] never said anything about shielding people. We seem to be the forgotten people. ""We didn't think it was going to be good news, and now we just have to wait."" A number of suburbs included in the original lockdown boundary will be removed from 24 July, following discussions between the government and the county council. However, restrictions will remain in the borough of Oadby and Wigston as case numbers are still above the national average. Borough council leader John Boyce called its continued inclusion ""a complete slap in the face to residents"" and said he was ""extremely disappointed"" the county council had recommended restrictions remain. County council leader Nick Rushton said the borough was a ""hot spot"" and ""so far above the national average for cases that we have to remain cautious"". Leicestershire County Council has published a revised map of the lockdown boundary Leicester mayor Sir Peter Soulsby, who earliersuggested restrictions ""should be lifted for 90% of the city"", expressed disappointment at the latest announcement. He said he was ""extremely frustrated that a sledgehammer approach is being taken to deal with an issue in a very small part of the city"". Liz Kendall, Labour MP for Leicester West,tweeted,externalthat people in the city would be ""very disappointed that whilst non-essential retail can now open our hospitality sector can't and travel restrictions still apply"". Mr Edwards said the extended closure would have a huge impact on his business Blake Edwards, who runs a barber shop in the city, said news of a further delay to reopening was ""heartbreaking"". ""I'm really angry and bitter,"" he said. ""While this needs to be done and we want everyone to be safe, with another two weeks we need some financial support. ""It's really serious for us now. Leicester will be in a dark place if we don't sort this out."" The East Midlands Chamber of Commerce said restrictions could have been lifted in parts of the city. Chief executive Scott Knowles said: ""The government has rightly identified areas of the county that have experienced a less severe outbreak and removed them from the lockdown area. ""There's no reason why this same logic can't be applied to those wards in the city of Leicester where infection rates are also at, or below, the national average.""

"Ex-MP 'paid Â£5,000 compensation' to 'groped' woman","Charlie Elphicke is charged with three counts of sexual assault A former MP accused of sexually assaulting a woman agreed to pay her Â£5,000 to prevent his wife from finding out, a court heard. Charlie Elphicke, 49, said the complainant demanded to be paid ""compensation"" after he made advances towards her at his London home in 2007. Mr Elphicke said he believed the woman had ""wanted to take matters further"" after they shared a bottle of wine. At Southwark Crown Court he denies three counts of sexual assault. Mr Elphicke and the woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, drank together while Mrs Elphicke was away on business. The former Conservative MP said he had been ""under a misapprehension"" in making advances towards her. The woman, in her early-30s at the time, alleged Mr Elphicke tried to kiss her, groped her breast, then chased her around his home while trying to grab her buttocks. Excerpts from Mr Elphicke's interview with police in March 2018 were played in front of a jury. In them he said the woman asked him not to tell his wife about the 2007 incident and to pay her Â£5,000. He said: ""I got it [the Â£5,000] in smaller amounts - Â£500, Â£1,000 - because she was insistent Natalie shouldn't know."" Asked if he had ever told his wife about the payments, Mr Elphicke told police: ""No."" He also described how the first alleged incident happened and said that he stopped immediately when the woman told him to. He said: ""The atmosphere was very warm and convivial and I believed she wanted to take matters further. ""I leaned over and kissed her. ""At first she responded positively, then it became clear it was not what she wanted."" He said: ""I was incredibly apologetic. I believed this was what she wanted. ""She said she accepted my explanation, my apology, and that I had been under a misapprehension."" The trial continues.

Shielding in Wales to end on 16 August,"This video can not be played Dr Frank Atherton said people shielding ""can gradually resume day-to-day life"" Those most at risk from coronavirus can stop shielding after 16 August, Wales' chief medical officer has said. Around 130,000 people in Wales with underlying health conditions have been advised to stay indoors since the start of the pandemic to protect themselves. At the coronavirus briefing on Thursday, Dr Frank Atherton said such people in at-risk groups would be able to go to work, school or the shops. He said they ""can gradually resume day-to-day life"". Dr Atherton added the measures would be kept under review in case of a rise in transmission levels. Coronavirus: Who should be shielding? The billions being spent on coronavirus in Wales People shielding in Wales to be allowed outdoors He said it was still very important that people in the shielding group continued to pay strict attention to physical distancing and good hand hygiene. Some of the support which has been made available for those shielding will end, such as the weekly food box scheme -a direct food delivery service which is currently provided for people shielding. But supermarkets will continue to offer priority delivery slots for those who are deemed particularly vulnerable to coronavirus. A prescription delivery service will remain in place until 30 September, said Dr Atherton, who added he will be writing to everyone in the shielding group. People who are shielding will be sent a letter updating them on the latest situation Dr Atherton said the NHS in Wales will keep an up to date list of those who have been shielding, because ""we just don't know what's round the corner"". He added the Welsh Government may have to reinstate ""some form"" of shielding in the future, if the virus increases in Wales. ""It may be - we hope not - but it may be we may have to reinstitute some form of shielding in the future,"" he said. ""If we do that, it may not be exactly the same group, there's a piece of work going on at a UK level to do a better risk assessment so that we have a clearer idea of who really will benefit."" Shadow health minister Angela Burns MS said it was ""welcome news"" for the thousands of people who have been ""cut off from family, friends, work, school and any sense of a normal life."" But she added lifting restrictions on a Sunday seemed strange. ""For those who have been effectively isolated for months, were the pause from the Friday, or even the Saturday, that extra day could mean so much to people,"" she said. Lee Dirkzwager says she did not enjoy it when she had to go to the bank One woman who has been shielding since March said she feels it is still too soon. Lee Dirkzwager, 72, from Cardiff, has a number of underlying conditions, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. She said she briefly went out to go to the bank, but ""didn't enjoy it"". ""I'm trying to stay away from people and people are walking past you with no masks - it's not nice,"" she said. ""I think it's going to be a lot longer before I want to go out."" Thosemost at risk,externalof coronavirus, including: Solid organ transplant recipients Some people with cancer who are undergoing treatments such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy People on immunosuppression drugs Women who are pregnant and have heart disease People with severe respiratory conditions - cystic fibrosis, severe asthma and COPD Some people with rare diseases such as severe combined immunodeficiency Helen Iliff created badges to remind people about social distancing. As those shielding prepare to slowly return to normal life, a trainee anaesthetist has designed a pin badge encouraging others to keep their distance. Helen Iliff, who works at Prince Charles Hospital, Merthyr Tydfil, created the badge while she herself was shielding. ""It's been very exciting and I like to think I've made the most of the time shielding,"" she said.

Leicester lockdown measures eased after cases dropHealth Secretary Matt Hancock said there were positive signs the actions taken were working.,"This video can not be played Some lockdown measures in Leicester will be partially relaxed, the health secretary announces. A stricter lockdown in Leicester will be eased after a drop in coronavirus cases, Matt Hancock has said. The health secretary told the House of Commons some restrictions would be lifted from 24 July ""but not all"" following a prolonged lockdown. The city remained under strict measures from 29 June after a spike in cases. Restrictions on schools and nurseries will be lifted but bars remain closed as virus rates ""still remain well above the national average"", Mr Hancock said. The secretary of state said the latest data showed the seven-day infection rate in Leicester was now 119 cases per 100,000 people - down from 135 when the prolonged lockdown was announced. The local lockdown was announced on 29 June A new local power will be used to close shops selling non-essential items where necessary. Bars and restaurants in the city will still not be allowed to open and the ban on non-essential travel and social gatherings of more six people will remain in force. Despite announcing schools can reopen, those run by the city and county council have already closed for the summer. Mr Hancock said: ""Some say that the local lockdown is unnecessary. ""I wish this were true, but sadly it remains vital for the health of everyone in Leicester and the rest of the country that these restrictions stay in place. ""We will review them again in a fortnight. I hope that this careful easing of restrictions will provide some comfort to people in Leicester and Leicestershire."" Michelle Teale (right) has not seen her 85-year-old mother for 20 weeks Michelle Teale, who has incurable breast cancer, said she was upset the announcement made no mention of people still ""shielding"" in the city. In his 29 June announcement, the health secretary said the nationwide relaxation of shielding measures on 6 July would not apply to Leicester. ""Each week that goes by is another week taken away from me,"" she said. ""Yet again, he [Matt Hancock] never said anything about shielding people. We seem to be the forgotten people. ""We didn't think it was going to be good news, and now we just have to wait."" A number of suburbs included in the original lockdown boundary will be removed from 24 July, following discussions between the government and the county council. However, restrictions will remain in the borough of Oadby and Wigston as case numbers are still above the national average. Borough council leader John Boyce called its continued inclusion ""a complete slap in the face to residents"" and said he was ""extremely disappointed"" the county council had recommended restrictions remain. County council leader Nick Rushton said the borough was a ""hot spot"" and ""so far above the national average for cases that we have to remain cautious"". Leicestershire County Council has published a revised map of the lockdown boundary Leicester mayor Sir Peter Soulsby, who earliersuggested restrictions ""should be lifted for 90% of the city"", expressed disappointment at the latest announcement. He said he was ""extremely frustrated that a sledgehammer approach is being taken to deal with an issue in a very small part of the city"". Liz Kendall, Labour MP for Leicester West,tweeted,externalthat people in the city would be ""very disappointed that whilst non-essential retail can now open our hospitality sector can't and travel restrictions still apply"". Mr Edwards said the extended closure would have a huge impact on his business Blake Edwards, who runs a barber shop in the city, said news of a further delay to reopening was ""heartbreaking"". ""I'm really angry and bitter,"" he said. ""While this needs to be done and we want everyone to be safe, with another two weeks we need some financial support. ""It's really serious for us now. Leicester will be in a dark place if we don't sort this out."" The East Midlands Chamber of Commerce said restrictions could have been lifted in parts of the city. Chief executive Scott Knowles said: ""The government has rightly identified areas of the county that have experienced a less severe outbreak and removed them from the lockdown area. ""There's no reason why this same logic can't be applied to those wards in the city of Leicester where infection rates are also at, or below, the national average.""

Virus restrictions to be eased for shielding Scots,"People who are ""shielding"" in Scotland are to be allowed to stay in holiday accommodation and visit outdoor markets and gardens, in a change to advice. Nicola Sturgeon said virus restrictions for the most vulnerable group are to be eased from Friday. This will allow these people to go out more, and for couples who do not live together to meet up without distancing. And the first minister said it was hoped the need for shielding could be paused entirely at the end of July. There are about 180,000 people shielding in Scotland. Live: Latest on coronavirus in Scotland The shielding group includes those who are at the greatest risk of becoming seriously ill with coronavirus. People who have certain types of cancer or severe respiratory conditions, and those who have received solid organ transplants come into the category. The restrictions on this group are gradually being phased out, and they were allowed to cease physical distancing with people they live with last week. Nicola Sturgeon said the change would be welcome, but could also be ""quite daunting"" for some The latest move - to take effect on Friday - will see advice changed to say the shielded can stay at holiday accommodation, including hotels. They will also be able to visit outdoor markets and public gardens, and couples who do not live together will be allowed to meet up without maintaining a physical distance. Ms Sturgeon said she hoped to be able to pause the need for shielding entirely at the end of July, but said ""we would still encourage those in this group to take extra care"". She added; ""I know returning to something like normal life will be welcome, but I appreciate it is also known to be quite daunting. ""The Scottish government will provide more information nearer the time and will do everything we can to support you in this transition."" The first minister said people who are not shielding should think about how they can help, giving the example of wearing face coverings in shops and on public transport. And she said employers should consider how they can make workplaces as safe as possible for those in the shielding group. She said: ""This is good news, but will be prompting some understandable stress and anxiety - so all of us can take some small steps that might make some difference to people who are shielding.""

Fresh row over devolved powers after Brexit,"The Scottish and UK governments have clashed in a fresh row about how powers will be shared out post-Brexit. Plans for how a UK-wide ""internal market"" will operate after the country leaves the EU have been published. UK Business Secretary Alok Sharma told BBC Scotland that the move would see ""the biggest transfer of powers in the history of devolution"". But Scottish Constitution Secretary Mike Russell said this was a ""lie"" and that powers would really be taken away. The proposals were set out in a white paper, with legislation to follow later in the year. Ministers unveil post-Brexit powers for UK nations When the UK cuts its final ties with the EU at the end of the Brexit transition period in the New Year, a raft of powers currently exercised from Brussels will return to more local control. The Scottish and UK governments have been locked in a lengthy dispute about who will ultimately be responsible for issues such as air quality, animal welfare and food quality. Many powers are set to be directly controlled by the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish administrations, in fields including food labelling, energy efficiency and support for farmers. However, the UK government has said the devolved administrations will still have to accept goods and services from other parts of the UK - even if they have set different standards locally - to ensure a level playing field in the ""internal market"". Scottish ministers believe this means standards across the country could be dragged down if the UK government makes concessions in new trade deals. Alok Sharma said it was important to give ""certainty"" to businesses Mr Sharma told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme that the move was a ""power surge"" for the devolved administrations. He said: ""We've had a seamless UK internal market for hundreds of years and that's been very good in terms of free flow of goods and services within all part of the UK. Our plans are for this to continue after the transition period. ""Ultimately this is about certainty for businesses, its about protecting jobs and livelihoods and supporting investment decisions, it's going to be good for consumers as well and ultimately this is about underpinning the recovery. ""All devolved policy areas will stay devolved, and there will be the biggest transfer of powers in the history of devolution at the end of the transition period."" There has beena long-running rowover how ""common frameworks"" of regulations will work across the four nations, with UK ministers saying it is vital for ""all UK companies to trade unhindered in every part of the UK"". The government said there could be ""serious problems"" if Welsh lamb producers were unable to sell their products in Scotland, or if Scottish whisky producers were unable to buy barley from English farms because different rules were in place on either side of the border. Mr Sharma said: ""The devolved nations can of course set their own regulations, but the key thing is that businesses are able to continue to trade. ""We have been working with the devolved administrations in terms of our common frameworks, which is about sitting down in a collaborative way and coming up with regulations that apply to the whole of the UK."" Mike Russell said the UK government was lying about the new powers Mr Russell said Mr Sharma's claims about new powers for Holyrood were ""not true"", saying MSPs had already legislated in a series of areas highlighted. He said: ""The list of powers that's been issued by the UK government is simply dishonest. It's one of the most shocking pieces of dishonesty I've seen from a government. ""It's a mishmash of things the Scottish Parliament already has, things they've already decided we won't have because of the frameworks, and things that could be automatically overridden by a decision by the UK government to take a power away. ""There aren't new powers for the Scottish Parliament, that is a lie. Nobody should be fooled by this - what is actually happening here is taking away very significant powers that will have an effect on our daily lives."" Mr Russell said the Scottish government had been happy to abide by the ""high and sensible standards"" set at an EU level, but said the UK government could ""lower those standards dramatically"" to win trade deals. ""The US will not give trade deals unless agriculture is involved, and US agriculture will drive down standards. That is what we are facing."" Mr Sharma insisted that the UK government ""has always set very high standards"", adding that ""in some areas our standards have been higher than those of the EU"". He added: ""What we are not going to be doing in any of these agreements is compromising the very high environmental, animal welfare and food safety standards that we have."" There is a hint of dÃ©jÃ -vu about this continuation of a row that has been rumbling along pretty much ever since the UK voted to leave the EU more than four years ago. Is this a ""power grab"" or a ""power surge""? As ever in politics, the answer is a bit more complicated than either side is letting on. The operation of cross-border regulatory frameworks and state aid rules might not be hot talking points down the socially-distanced pub, so perhaps it is understandable that politicians are reaching for sweeping rhetoric rather than detail - particularly given their starkly opposed positions on the underlying issue of Brexit. But ultimately these rules could have an important impact on everyday life. There are real concerns about whether the UK's new trade deals will see our markets opened up to sub-standard products from abroad - but also about the security of cross-border trade between the four nations, which is hugely important to many businesses. A lot of the nuance in this complex debate risks being lost amid the political rammy.

"'No reason' to change home working adviceWorking from home is still a ""perfectly good option"" to curb the virus, the chief scientific adviser says.","Sir Patrick wore a reusable mask to the session in Parliament There is ""absolutely no reason"" to change the guidance on working from home, the UK's chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance has said. Since late March the government has advised people to work from home if possible to help curb coronavirus. But last week Prime Minister Boris Johnson signalled a change, saying: ""I think we should now say, well, 'Go back to work if you can.'"" Sir Patrick said home working was still a ""perfectly good option"" for many. Speaking to the Commons science and technology committee, he said it was his view - and one shared by the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) - that distancing measures were still important for containing the virus. ""Of the various distancing measures, working from home for many companies remains a perfectly good option because it's easy to do,"" he said. ""I think a number of companies think it's actually not detrimental to productivity. And in that situation, there's absolutely no reason I can see to change it."" It comes as the government continues to try to balance the economic and health risks of the pandemic. UK payrolls shrink by 649,000 jobs in lockdown What's the future for the office? How many confirmed cases are there in your area? Asked about Britain's response to the virus, Sir Patrick said: ""It's clear that the outcome has not been good in the UK, I think you can be absolutely clear about that. ""There are many factors that are going to play in this as we look and say, 'what is it that makes some countries having done worse than others?', and there will be decisions made that will turn out not to have been the right decisions at the time."" In mid-March, Sir Patrick said it would be a ""good outcome"" for the UK if the number of deaths from the virus could be kept below 20,000. The latest figures show 45,119 people have died after testing positive for coronavirus in the UK, up by 66 on the previous day. Sir Patrick said it was ""quite probable"" that the virus will come back ""in different waves over a number of years"", but stressed the UK was still going through the first wave. ""When people talk about second wave now, actually, what I think they're talking about really is a re-emergence of the first wave,"" he said. ""All we have done is suppressed the first wave and when you take the brakes off you would expect it to come back."" It comes after a report, requested by the scientific adviser, suggestedthe UK could see about 120,000 new coronavirus deathsduring this winter. This could be seen as ""the tail end of the first wave still"", he said. During the session, Sir Patrick told MPs the government was advised to implement lockdown measures earlier than they did. In the run up to lockdown, he said steps were taken to mitigate the virus, including isolating households and advising against visiting pubs and theatres which caused ""quite extreme"" changes in behaviour. But he said after data suggested the number of virus cases was doubling every three days, Sage recommended - either on 16 or 18 March - that the ""remainder"" of measures to curb coronavirus should be introduced. Speaking in the Commons afterwards, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: ""16 March is the day when I came to this House and said that all unnecessary social contact should cease - that is precisely when the lockdown was started."" Labour MP Zarah Sultana said that ""advising people to socially distance is not the same as imposing a lockdown. That week-long delay could have cost thousands of lives"". In June,former government adviser Prof Neil Ferguson saidthe number of coronavirus deaths in the UK would have been halved if lockdown had been introduced a week earlier. The beginning of lockdown has usually been dated to the evening of 23 March when Prime Minister Boris Johnson addressed the nation and people were told to mostly avoid leaving home and all non-essential shops were closed. In fact, Mr Hancock has previously said that is when lockdown began. In a debate in the Commons on 2 June, he noted that the daily death figures were ""lower than at any time since lockdown began on 23 March"". BBC health correspondent James Gallagher said: ""A key piece of evidence came out on Monday 16 Marchwhich showed that250,000 people could die. ""That night, the government advised people to avoid pubs and work from home if possible. On Wednesday schools were told they would close at the end of the week. ""On Friday, all restaurants, pubs, clubs and indoor sport and leisure facilities were ordered to shut. The UK was then put into full lockdown the following Monday."" Sir Patrick also said there was no assumption that a vaccine for coronavirus would be available in the immediate future, afterencouraging early results from clinical trialsraised hopes of finding one. ""Our assumption is we won't have it and when we get it we will be thrilled,"" he said. Conservative MP Mark Logan asked Sir Patrick about his face covering, which he wore as he entered the session but took off while giving evidence. ""It's a fairly standard cloth face covering,"" he said. ""It's got a nose thing to make sure it doesn't slip off my nose and it's got several layers."" Foggy glasses, recycling, kids: Your guide to wearing a mask Coronavirus: How to make your own face mask Asked how long he would wear it for and whether he washes it, Sir Patrick said: ""I think you should wear them for short periods. As I say, I don't think it's something you can wear all day in indoor environments - there's some evidence for that. ""And yes, like my other clothes, I wash it.""

Russians sought to meddle in UK election â Raab,"This video can not be played Dominic Raab: ""Reasonable confidence"" Russia tried to interfere in 2019 election Russians almost certainly sought to interfere in the 2019 UK general election through illicitly acquired documents, the government has said. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said any attempt to meddle in UK democracy was ""completely unacceptable"". The documents - on UK-US trade discussions - emerged online and were used by Labour in the 2019 campaign. A much-delayed report into allegations of wider Russian interference into UK democracy is due next week. Labour said it condemned ""any attempt by Russia, or any foreign power, to interfere in our country's democratic processes"" and pledged to work to protect the nation's security. This is the first time the government has acknowledged with such certainty that Russians interfered in the UK's democratic processes. A Downing Street spokesman dismissed as ""nonsense"" suggestions that the timing of Mr Raab's statement was aimed at pre-empting the publication of the Russia report by Parliament's Intelligence and Security Committee. Kuenssberg: Curious timing of Russian meddling claims Can UK election meddling be linked to the Kremlin? Five things we learned from leaked trade papers At the 2019 election, then-Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the documents proved the Conservatives were planning to include the NHS in a future trade agreement with the US - something denied by the government. Writing on his Facebook page, Mr Corbyn accused the Conservatives of wanting ""to distract from the damage a Trump trade deal would do to our NHS by continuing to push the bogus claim Labour received Russian support"". He added that the government's claim ""is an attempt to divert attention from the threat to the NHS and the Tory party links to Russian oligarchs expected to be revealed in the long-buried parliamentary Russia report."" The government launched an inquiry into how the papers got into the public domain, with help from the National Cyber Security Centre. The announcement comes asa group of national security services warnthat Russian hackers are targeting organisations trying to develop a coronavirus vaccine. Despite many suspicions of Russian attempts at meddling in the referendum and other campaigns, significant concrete evidence is in short supply. So, it matters that this is the first time a UK minister has made an explicit link to Russia, in one way or another, trying to meddle in elections in the UK. But the timing of that statement creates its own intrigue too. Next week, at long last, the powerful group of MPs who monitor UK intelligence will publish a report on the Russian threat to the UK - a report that has been anticipated for a very long time and may perhaps set the record straight on all of this. Is it politically convenient for ministers to acknowledge the threat themselves just before others may make embarrassing claims about it? Labour politicians have frequently accused the Conservatives of ignoring Russian interference because of their relationship with Tory Party donors. Did it suit the government to publicise the claims that material used by Labour was also manipulated by Russia? It seems, as one former UK ambassador to Moscow said, a ""remarkable coincidence"" that the government decided at this moment to admit explicitly, for the first time, that Russia has tried to stick its nose into our politics - especially when there is a running criminal investigation into who obtained the documents to start with. But Downing Street denies that there is any link in the timing at all. Read more from Laura here. In a written ministerial statement, Mr Raab said ""the government has concluded that it is almost certain that Russian actors sought to interfere in the 2019 general election through the online amplification of illicitly acquired and leaked government documents. He said the documents were disseminated online via the social media platform Reddit. ""When these gained no traction, further attempts were made to promote the illicitly acquired material online in the run up to the general election,"" he said. The foreign secretary goes on to say that there is ""no evidence of a broad spectrum Russian campaign against the general election"" but that ""any attempt to interfere in our democratic processes is completely unacceptable"". The forum website Reddit said the unredacted papers had been uploaded as ""part of a campaign that has been reported as originating from Russia"". It suspended 61 accounts that showed a ""pattern of coordination"". Mr Raab's statement is not connected to the Intelligence and Security Committee's report into Russian interference, which is due to be published next week. Jeremy Corbyn holds up the leaked documents at a press conference on 27 November The committee launched its inquiry in November 2017 following concern Russia sought to influence the US 2016 election and the 2016 Brexit vote. Afterthe poisoning of ex-Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yuliain March 2018 the investigation became the ""primary focus"" of the committee. The committee heard evidence from independent experts as well as the secret intelligence agencies, MI5, MI6 and GCHQ. BBC security correspondent Gordon Corera said the committee's report has looked into Russian activity from traditional espionage to subversion - with a particular focus on possible interference in the 2016 EU referendum and 2017 general election. In addition to cyber-espionage and social media campaigns, the report also examines Russian influence through money. The delay in publication has led to speculation the report contains details embarrassing for the Conservatives - specifically in relation to the party's Russian donors. However, Commons leader Jacob Rees-Mogg insisted the hold-up was due to a number of committee members leaving Parliament and the need ""to make sure that the right people with the right level of experience and responsibility could be appointed"". Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said Mr Raab's statement was ""ambiguous"" and ""confusing"". She said Mr Raab had said there was ""no evidence of full-scale interference"" by Russia in his statement but had also claimed ""any attempts of such interference are unacceptable"".

Emergency loans for universities about to go bust,"Universities have warned of financial losses from the pandemic Universities in England at risk of going bust could apply for emergency loans from the government, in plans announced by the education secretary. But any rescue would come with conditions, including cutting pay for vice chancellors and senior staff. It could also require universities to focus more on subjects with better job prospects for graduates. A report from the Institute for Fiscal Studies warned that 13 unnamed universities were facing insolvency. Universities have warned of cash problems from the coronavirus pandemic - particularly if overseas students cancel plans to study in the UK. A recent analysis from the Institute for Fiscal Studieswarned of a ""significant financial threat""to the UK's higher education system from the pandemic - with losses that could be between Â£3bn and Â£19bn. To avoid the collapse of a university and disruption to students, the government has put forward ""last resort"" plans for how it will intervene. Covid fears putting off Chinese students from studying in UK 13 universities at risk of going bust Universities call for emergency funding There are no guarantees of support, or as the proposals say - ""not all providers will be prevented from exiting the market"" - but universities could be offered a repayable loan, which would come with ""restructuring"" conditions. Universities are autonomous organisations, but the rescue packages would see the government exerting more control over what was taught and how money was spent. There could be cost cutting through ""closing unviable campuses"" and mergers, including with further education colleges. Universities would be expected to end courses seen as being of ""low value"", with an emphasis on either high-quality research or courses with good job prospects. There have been warnings of the financial risks if many Chinese students cancel plans to study in the UK Vocational and higher technical courses could be encouraged - and universities would be expected to offer courses more closely linked to the local economy. ""Vice-chancellor pay has for years faced widespread public criticism,"" say the proposals, with an expectation that there would be limits on salaries for senior staff. Universities would have to ""strip back on bureaucracy"" and any funding for student unions should be for the ""wider student  population rather than subsidising niche activism"", say the plans for the ""restructuring regime"". Jo Grady of the UCU lecturers' union accused the government of ""exploiting"" financial difficulties to narrow what universities offered and to impose its ""evidence-free ideology"". The lecturers' leader criticised an ""obsession with graduate earnings as a sole measure of quality"". Alistair Jarvis, chief executive of Universities UK, called on the government to be ""more ambitious, to go beyond a small number of universities in financial need"" and to extend the funding more widely. The government has previously announced measures to support universities during the pandemic - including bringing forward tuition fee income and promising that ""research-intensive"" universities could receive loans to cover 80% of international student losses. ""This new scheme will help those who are still facing financial difficulty as a result of Covid-19,"" said Education Secretary Gavin Williamson.

"UK payrolls shrink by 649,000 jobs in lockdown","The number of workers on UK company payrolls fell by 649,000 between March and June, official figures indicate. The overall jobless rate was unchanged but there are 47,000 more young people unemployed than there were a year ago. Unemployment has not surged, as many feared, because large numbers of firms have put employees on the government-backed furlough scheme. But economists say the full effect on employment will not be felt until the scheme ends in October. The headline unemployment rate hasn't budged since the lockdown was introduced. It stayed at 3.9% between March and May, unchanged on the previous three months. The number of people claiming work-related benefits last month - including the unemployed - is also marginally lower at 2.6 million. Why is the jobless rate not rising? But because of the effect of the furlough scheme on the employment market, analysts say the number of hours worked per week is currently a truer reflection of the impact of the coronavirus crisis. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said that since the start of the pandemic, total weekly hours worked in the UK had fallen by a record 175.3 million, or 16.7%, to 877.1 million hours. ""This was the largest annual decrease since estimates began in 1971, with total hours dropping to its lowest level since May to July 1997,"" the ONS added. The number of Britons on payrolls - which means people employed by a company and does not include the self-employed - fell by 2.2% in June compared with March. Young people are being especially badly hit. ""The estimated number of people unemployed aged 16 to 24 years increased by 47,000 on the year, while other age groups remained steady,"" the ONS said. This video can not be played Four experts offer advice to people looking for a job Many young people are employed in the hospitality industry, which was largely shut down from 23 March. The retail sector, another source of jobs for younger people, has also been hard hit by the lockdown. A fifth of all of those claiming out-of-work benefits, 514,770, are aged between 18 and 24. The number of young new claimants who have signed on between March and June is 276,000 - more than doubling over three months. BBC analysis has found there are now constituencies with nearly 20% of their young population on Universal Credit or Jobseeker's Allowance - including Walton in Liverpool and south Blackpool. Even affluent areas such as south-west Surrey, Henley and Windsor have seen a quadrupling in the number of young claimants under lockdown, though many of these are likely to have become eligible to claim as a result of being furloughed. According to the Resolution Foundation, one-third of 18 to 24-year-old employees have lost jobs or been furloughed during the pandemic, compared to one in six adults above that age. There are not many jobs around for anyone. Vacancies in the UK in April to June 2020 are at the lowest level since the survey began in April to June 2001, at an estimated 333,000. ""This is 23% lower than the previous record low in April to June 2009,"" the ONS said. The ONS added that a larger than usual number of those losing their jobs were not currently searching for another one and were therefore economically inactive rather than unemployed, while some longer-term unemployed people had stopped looking for work. A survey by the British Chambers of Commerce said 29% of businesses expected to cut jobs in the next three months. It called for a reduction in employers' National Insurance contributions to protect businesses and jobs. The government's spending watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility, has warned that in the worst-case scenario,unemployment could rise to four million. Danielle Skinner, 23, of Hollinwood, Oldham. was made redundant from her first job at the start of this month. She had been in full-time work since November last year at a digital marketing firm, having been kept on after doing an apprenticeship. Danielle Skinner has applied for more than 50 jobs since being made redundant At first, she was put on furlough. ""But then, as things progressed and businesses started to make people redundant, it did give me an inkling that this was something possibly that was going to happen to me,"" she told the BBC. ""I felt heartbroken personally, because I'd just started to get my career going and I felt like everything was just falling to pieces. Despite her distress, Danielle says she doesn't blame the company: ""The business has to survive and if they didn't take immediate action, then the business could have gone into administration and then there would be no jobs."" She has already applied for 50 or so jobs and has only had one or two responses, which she finds very disheartening. ""It does get me down, I am struggling to find a job, but nevertheless I do try and remain positive and optimistic, thinking, 'I am employable and someone one day will employ me and I'll enjoy the job so much.'"" There's a storm coming: the government's official number-crunchers - the Office for Budget Responsibility - have warned that unemployment could hit four million this year. But the bulk of that is yet to hit the numbers. The normal counts of employment have been propped up by support schemes: more than 11 million private sector workers are still on the government payroll. Those plans have been very effective in staving off a greater crisis as lockdown hit. The looming turmoil and hardship is clear however, with average real pay - that's after inflation - 1.3% lower than a year ago in May and the number of job vacancies at a record low. The number of people counting as self-employed has fallen a record 178,000. As employers now look towards the winding down of support schemes, the announcements of layoffs are now multiplying.Despite the chancellor's new plan, a big rise in joblessness still seems inevitable. The challenge is to getting people back into work - particularly younger ones, the group most likely to have been furloughed. Lengthy unemployment, especially at the start of a career, can blight livelihoods and prospects for decades. And while the economy is opening up, the uncertain outlook may make employers reluctant to do the same with hiring. Business Secretary Alok Sharma said he had ""enormous sympathy"" for people who found themselves out of work. ""I know it's going to be very, very difficult for lots of people as a result of this. The best thing we can do is continue to open up the economy in a phased manner and a cautious manner and get businesses up and running again,"" he told the BBC. He said the cost of inaction would have been ""far greater"" than the action the government had taken. Bridget Phillipson, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said every lost job was ""a personal tragedy now and a hammer blow to public finances in the long run"". She accused the chancellor of taking a ""blanket approach"" rather than targeting the sectors worst affected by the crisis. How have you been affected?

Leicester lockdown measures eased after cases dropHealth Secretary Matt Hancock said there were positive signs the actions taken were working.Leicester,"This video can not be played Some lockdown measures in Leicester will be partially relaxed, the health secretary announces. A stricter lockdown in Leicester will be eased after a drop in coronavirus cases, Matt Hancock has said. The health secretary told the House of Commons some restrictions would be lifted from 24 July ""but not all"" following a prolonged lockdown. The city remained under strict measures from 29 June after a spike in cases. Restrictions on schools and nurseries will be lifted but bars remain closed as virus rates ""still remain well above the national average"", Mr Hancock said. The secretary of state said the latest data showed the seven-day infection rate in Leicester was now 119 cases per 100,000 people - down from 135 when the prolonged lockdown was announced. The local lockdown was announced on 29 June A new local power will be used to close shops selling non-essential items where necessary. Bars and restaurants in the city will still not be allowed to open and the ban on non-essential travel and social gatherings of more six people will remain in force. Despite announcing schools can reopen, those run by the city and county council have already closed for the summer. Mr Hancock said: ""Some say that the local lockdown is unnecessary. ""I wish this were true, but sadly it remains vital for the health of everyone in Leicester and the rest of the country that these restrictions stay in place. ""We will review them again in a fortnight. I hope that this careful easing of restrictions will provide some comfort to people in Leicester and Leicestershire."" Michelle Teale (right) has not seen her 85-year-old mother for 20 weeks Michelle Teale, who has incurable breast cancer, said she was upset the announcement made no mention of people still ""shielding"" in the city. In his 29 June announcement, the health secretary said the nationwide relaxation of shielding measures on 6 July would not apply to Leicester. ""Each week that goes by is another week taken away from me,"" she said. ""Yet again, he [Matt Hancock] never said anything about shielding people. We seem to be the forgotten people. ""We didn't think it was going to be good news, and now we just have to wait."" A number of suburbs included in the original lockdown boundary will be removed from 24 July, following discussions between the government and the county council. However, restrictions will remain in the borough of Oadby and Wigston as case numbers are still above the national average. Borough council leader John Boyce called its continued inclusion ""a complete slap in the face to residents"" and said he was ""extremely disappointed"" the county council had recommended restrictions remain. County council leader Nick Rushton said the borough was a ""hot spot"" and ""so far above the national average for cases that we have to remain cautious"". Leicestershire County Council has published a revised map of the lockdown boundary Leicester mayor Sir Peter Soulsby, who earliersuggested restrictions ""should be lifted for 90% of the city"", expressed disappointment at the latest announcement. He said he was ""extremely frustrated that a sledgehammer approach is being taken to deal with an issue in a very small part of the city"". Liz Kendall, Labour MP for Leicester West,tweeted,externalthat people in the city would be ""very disappointed that whilst non-essential retail can now open our hospitality sector can't and travel restrictions still apply"". Mr Edwards said the extended closure would have a huge impact on his business Blake Edwards, who runs a barber shop in the city, said news of a further delay to reopening was ""heartbreaking"". ""I'm really angry and bitter,"" he said. ""While this needs to be done and we want everyone to be safe, with another two weeks we need some financial support. ""It's really serious for us now. Leicester will be in a dark place if we don't sort this out."" The East Midlands Chamber of Commerce said restrictions could have been lifted in parts of the city. Chief executive Scott Knowles said: ""The government has rightly identified areas of the county that have experienced a less severe outbreak and removed them from the lockdown area. ""There's no reason why this same logic can't be applied to those wards in the city of Leicester where infection rates are also at, or below, the national average.""

"'Better public transport' needed for M4 congestionBut people may be reluctant to use trains and buses after the coronavirus pandemic, a report says.Wales","This video can not be played ""Motorway charge may be necessary"" Better public transport is needed to provide an alternative to the scrapped M4 relief road, a panel of experts says. Some form of charging could also be a way to ease traffic, the South East Wales Transport Commission said. But alternatives such as reopening rail lines would need to be in place first, according to the report. The,externalat rush hour but Wales' first ministerscrapped a relief road planlast year. The report highlighted that people may be reluctant to use crowded public transport after the coronavirus pandemic and many may continue to work from home - so any long term predictions about traffic levels are not possible. It said a ""network of alternatives"" was needed, with a ""local rail backbone"" - more stations between Cardiff and Severn Tunnel Junction. Many people were using the motorway because they had no other realistic option, with journeys to and from Newport particularly poorly served, it found. But the different ways of working that have emerged during the coronavirus pandemic give a period of ""breathing space"". And the pandemic is now leading the committee to look in more detail at flexible working arrangements. Sophie Howe was appointed the first Future Generations Commissioner for Wales in 2016 Future Generations Commissioner for Wales Sophie Howe welcomed the idea of improving public transport, and called for more investment in the green economy. ""Wales didn't need a Â£1.6bn motorway a year ago and it doesn't need one now,"" she said. ""We need green jobs, industries and infrastructure to recover from the pandemic, and protect ourselves against the uncertainties of another crisis in the form of the climate and nature emergency."" But businesses which rely on the M4 say any charge to use the motorway would make them less competitive globally. Kath Lewis says a charge to use the M4 would add ""huge additional costs"" to businesses in the region ""All our components - down to the wires, the minutest of components - are delivered to us via freight,"" said Kath Lewis, director of Industrial Automation and Control, based in Newport. ""[There would be] huge additional cost to the business which would make us slightly less competitive in the global market. ""I think it's tough enough at the moment without adding additional barriers."" Mark Drakeford axed the relief road scheme in June last year because of its cost and impact on the environment, after ministersdeclared a climate emergency. He added he would not have gone ahead even if it was affordable because of the impact on theGwent Levelswaterways, which are home to rare birds and other species. Environmentalists opposed the now-axed plans for the new motorway Congestion on the M4 is largely a peak hours, commuting problem The M4 around Newport is the fourth most congested stretch of urban motorway in the UK Parts of the motorway have been operating at or close to their practical capacity Most commuting cars carry only one traveller Between Newport and Bristol, there are about 23,300 daily journeys The panel said the root cause of the congestion was because many places like housing estates, workplaces and retail parks had been located close to the motorway, without meaningful transport alternatives. ""In the absence of more developed transport alternatives, the motorway has been a natural point around which to plan developments,"" the report said. Prime minister has 'no say' on the M4 relief road What is it like to live near the M4? Lockdown 'reigniting a love for cycling' It added with Cardiff and Newport planning for physical and economic growth, congestion was likely to increase. ""Without transport alternatives, the design of many of these developments risks reinforcing car dependency rather than encouraging modal shift to public transport or active travel,"" it said. The panel found while there is a good rail service between Cardiff, Newport and Bristol centres, the majority of trips do not just involve city centres. The M4 relief road was proposed as a solution to tackling congestion around Newport ""As such, there is insufficient rail provision to offer a genuine alternative to the motorway."" It added the bus network does not serve travel patterns well either, and are not coordinated with train services in the majority of cases. The report suggested ""integrated ticketing"" and a coordinated timetable. Similar to buses, active travel - cycling or walking - is insufficiently integrated with the wider transport network, the report says. It highlights there is no dedicated active travel route between Newport station and the major employment sites in the city, and no commuter cycle route between Cardiff and Newport. Local authorities appear to have focussed on improving routes from suburban areas into centres, rather than traffic-free routes between council areas, it says. Before the pandemic, the panel said it expected to say traffic would grow in the medium term - but there is ""significant uncertainty"" regarding both the medium and long term now. It said stakeholders had already deemed a ""fundamental change in working behaviours"" necessary to end the traditional 09:00 to 17:00 office working. But there has been a slow, gradual increase since a dramatic fall in traffic at the end of March, as restrictions have begun to be relaxed - and the experts expect this to continue. It said traffic will rise ""even if everyone who can work from home continues to do so"". This video can not be played This video reveals the possible route of the M4 relief road Public transport capacity significantly falls with social distancing - by as much as between 70% and 90%. And car occupancy rates may also fall if public health guidance advises against car sharing. ""We therefore expect an increase in the number of single occupancy cars on the M4,"" the report said. What happens in the long term is uncertain, the report said, dependant on which behaviours revert to their pre-epidemic states. Key questions include: What will be the long-term impact of home working once social distancing measures are removed? Will people be willing to use crowded services in the future? Will more people be willing to walk or cycle to work as a result of their experiences? What will the public transport industry look like, financially, once the crisis interventions have been unwound? But it estimated the changes will not fundamentally change the long-term need for more transport options. The ""breathing space"" from the pandemic can be used to put good alternatives to the motorway in place. The report concludes that ""some sort of charging mechanism is necessary"" to encourage people to use public transport, cycle or walk. It also points out a charge could provide revenue funding for transport services. However, it said it would be difficult to introduce such measures before new transport alternatives are in place. The panel, which was set up to look at alternative solutions to the congestion after the relief road was scrapped, will issue a final report with specific recommendations for the Welsh Government by the end of the year.

Twitter hack: What went wrong and why it matters,"There are a lot of unanswered questions about the Twitter hack on Wednesday night - but one thing most agree on is it could have been far worse. Potentially thousands of people were scammed out of money after hijacked accounts of prominent verified users promised to double the money fans sent them in the cryptocurrency Bitcoin. Using Twitter's internal systems, the cyber-criminals' messages had a reach of at least 350 million people. And it looks like it made them about $110,000 (Â£86,800) in the few hours that the scam was active. It was an unprecedented attack on privacy, trust and security. But experts say the hackers could have caused far more damage. As the boss of a smaller messaging service put it: ""Thank God for greed."" Twitter has huge engagement in the US, Japan, Russia and the UK. It is the platform of choice for some of the most powerful and prominent people in the world. Their posts have moved financial markets and caused diplomatic incidents. With the US presidential election less than four months away, there are now valid questions to be asked about whether Twitter can be relied upon in the lead up to the vote. President Donald Trump's account was not taken over in the hack. But many were watching to see if it would fall after his Democrat rival Joe Biden's account tweeted out the scam. Presidential hopefuls Mike Bloomberg, who had sought the Democratic nomination, and Kanye West, who has said he will run as an independent, were among those hacked ""We already know Russia is planning to meddle in the 2020 election just as they did in the 2016 election,"" Dr Heather Williams, from King's College London, said. ""Social-media manipulation is one of their favourite tools. ""So this hack shows just how vulnerable social-media platforms are and how vulnerable Americans are to disinformation. ""If something bigger was at stake, such as the presidency, this could have really disastrous consequences and undermine our democratic processes."" The security implications of the hack are also wide-reaching, not just for Twitter but for all social networks Early suggestions are the hackers managed to access administration privileges, which allowed them to bypass the passwords of any account they wanted. Twitter appearedto confirm this in a tweet saying,external: ""We detected what we believe to be a co-ordinated social-engineering attack by people who successfully targeted some of our employees with access to internal systems and tools."" Celebrities including US boxer Floyd Mayweather and the singer Wiz Khalifa also lost control of their accounts ""Social-engineering"" could mean one of several things. It might imply a targeted phishing operation - a common tactic employed by cyber-criminals, who find out which individuals have the keys to a system they want to enter and then target them with personal emails that trick them into handing over details. Or it might mean the perpetrators managed to convince one or several staff members to go rogue, by offering a financial inducement or other means. Major US Twitter accounts hacked in Bitcoin scam The Benjamin Netanyahu Twitter hack that never was The technology company is going to face huge pressure to be more specific. ""Twitter's reputation is the cost of this cyber-attack,"" World Economic Forum cyber lead William Dixon said. ""This is a major security breach for Twitter. ""The worst in its history. ""More cyber-resilience is needed across the ecosystem to be able to protect social media users around the world."" Twitter is not answering reporters' questions directly but said it had taken ""significant steps to limit access to internal systems"" while it investigated. The company also said it was ""looking into what other malicious activity [the hackers] may have conducted or information they may have accessed"". The chief executive of the messaging service Element has raised the possibility confidential data was also exposed. ""It's highly likely private direct messages were accessible for a short time,"" Matthew Hodgson said. ""Next time, harvesting sensitive information could fuel a wave of extortion or something much worse."" Technology companies Apple and Uber have more than 5.5 million Twitter followers between them The idea Twitter has the ability to take over people's accounts no matter what security they have may shock some. But experts say it is a necessary part of any membership-based service. Facebook, Snapchat, Instagram and YouTube have been approached for comment on their security arrangements. None has responded. But Facebook's former chief security officer Alex Stamos told BBC News all consumer-facing companies needed a way to be able to help consumers recover hacked or otherwise locked-out accounts. ""The change that can be made here is that Twitter can restrict this ability for high-risk accounts to a much smaller number of users or create tools that require one person to initiate and another to approve the change,"" he said. ""This is, apparently, what they have already done for President Trump's account, following an incident in 2017. ""They will need to vastly expand these protections."" Beyond a potential loss of trust, Twitter may now face legal consequences too. The EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) says organisations such as Twitter have to show ""appropriate"" levels of security. And if data-protection officers judge Twitter failed to take adequate measures to protect European users, it could be fined. Earlier this year, the company's chief executive, Jack Dorsey, lost control of his account for 20 minutes. And in 2010, Twitter settled with the Federal Trade Commission after it was alleged hackers had obtained unauthorised administrative control, including the ability to send out phony tweets from then-President-elect Barack Obama and Fox News.

Russians sought to meddle in UK election â RaabThe government publishes a report on a leaked document used by Labour at the 2019 election.UK Politics,"This video can not be played Dominic Raab: ""Reasonable confidence"" Russia tried to interfere in 2019 election Russians almost certainly sought to interfere in the 2019 UK general election through illicitly acquired documents, the government has said. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said any attempt to meddle in UK democracy was ""completely unacceptable"". The documents - on UK-US trade discussions - emerged online and were used by Labour in the 2019 campaign. A much-delayed report into allegations of wider Russian interference into UK democracy is due next week. Labour said it condemned ""any attempt by Russia, or any foreign power, to interfere in our country's democratic processes"" and pledged to work to protect the nation's security. This is the first time the government has acknowledged with such certainty that Russians interfered in the UK's democratic processes. A Downing Street spokesman dismissed as ""nonsense"" suggestions that the timing of Mr Raab's statement was aimed at pre-empting the publication of the Russia report by Parliament's Intelligence and Security Committee. Kuenssberg: Curious timing of Russian meddling claims Can UK election meddling be linked to the Kremlin? Five things we learned from leaked trade papers At the 2019 election, then-Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the documents proved the Conservatives were planning to include the NHS in a future trade agreement with the US - something denied by the government. Writing on his Facebook page, Mr Corbyn accused the Conservatives of wanting ""to distract from the damage a Trump trade deal would do to our NHS by continuing to push the bogus claim Labour received Russian support"". He added that the government's claim ""is an attempt to divert attention from the threat to the NHS and the Tory party links to Russian oligarchs expected to be revealed in the long-buried parliamentary Russia report."" The government launched an inquiry into how the papers got into the public domain, with help from the National Cyber Security Centre. The announcement comes asa group of national security services warnthat Russian hackers are targeting organisations trying to develop a coronavirus vaccine. Despite many suspicions of Russian attempts at meddling in the referendum and other campaigns, significant concrete evidence is in short supply. So, it matters that this is the first time a UK minister has made an explicit link to Russia, in one way or another, trying to meddle in elections in the UK. But the timing of that statement creates its own intrigue too. Next week, at long last, the powerful group of MPs who monitor UK intelligence will publish a report on the Russian threat to the UK - a report that has been anticipated for a very long time and may perhaps set the record straight on all of this. Is it politically convenient for ministers to acknowledge the threat themselves just before others may make embarrassing claims about it? Labour politicians have frequently accused the Conservatives of ignoring Russian interference because of their relationship with Tory Party donors. Did it suit the government to publicise the claims that material used by Labour was also manipulated by Russia? It seems, as one former UK ambassador to Moscow said, a ""remarkable coincidence"" that the government decided at this moment to admit explicitly, for the first time, that Russia has tried to stick its nose into our politics - especially when there is a running criminal investigation into who obtained the documents to start with. But Downing Street denies that there is any link in the timing at all. Read more from Laura here. In a written ministerial statement, Mr Raab said ""the government has concluded that it is almost certain that Russian actors sought to interfere in the 2019 general election through the online amplification of illicitly acquired and leaked government documents. He said the documents were disseminated online via the social media platform Reddit. ""When these gained no traction, further attempts were made to promote the illicitly acquired material online in the run up to the general election,"" he said. The foreign secretary goes on to say that there is ""no evidence of a broad spectrum Russian campaign against the general election"" but that ""any attempt to interfere in our democratic processes is completely unacceptable"". The forum website Reddit said the unredacted papers had been uploaded as ""part of a campaign that has been reported as originating from Russia"". It suspended 61 accounts that showed a ""pattern of coordination"". Mr Raab's statement is not connected to the Intelligence and Security Committee's report into Russian interference, which is due to be published next week. Jeremy Corbyn holds up the leaked documents at a press conference on 27 November The committee launched its inquiry in November 2017 following concern Russia sought to influence the US 2016 election and the 2016 Brexit vote. Afterthe poisoning of ex-Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yuliain March 2018 the investigation became the ""primary focus"" of the committee. The committee heard evidence from independent experts as well as the secret intelligence agencies, MI5, MI6 and GCHQ. BBC security correspondent Gordon Corera said the committee's report has looked into Russian activity from traditional espionage to subversion - with a particular focus on possible interference in the 2016 EU referendum and 2017 general election. In addition to cyber-espionage and social media campaigns, the report also examines Russian influence through money. The delay in publication has led to speculation the report contains details embarrassing for the Conservatives - specifically in relation to the party's Russian donors. However, Commons leader Jacob Rees-Mogg insisted the hold-up was due to a number of committee members leaving Parliament and the need ""to make sure that the right people with the right level of experience and responsibility could be appointed"". Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said Mr Raab's statement was ""ambiguous"" and ""confusing"". She said Mr Raab had said there was ""no evidence of full-scale interference"" by Russia in his statement but had also claimed ""any attempts of such interference are unacceptable"".

Coronavirus in Scotland - School restart plan & one new death,"Pupils will not have to physically distance when schools return in August, but teachers will, new advice to the government has suggested One person who tested positive for coronavirus died within the last 24 hours - this is the first fatality, under that measure, for eight days The prevalence of the virus in Scotland remains low says First Minister Nicola Sturgeon The R-number - which suggests the rate at which one person can infect others - is below one The percentage of people in Scotland who have been exposed to coronavirus is likely to be less than 5% Based on random testing of blood samples between the end of April and the end of June this year it was revealed that 4.3% had antibodies The rules around those who are shielding will change from tomorrow with more freedoms allowed, including holidaying away from home Unemployment in Scotland rose between March and May as the impact of lockdown was felt BBC Scotland News That's all from us here on BBC Scotland's live page, on Thursday 16 July 2020. Here's a reminder of today's headlines: Teachers may not have to wear face coverings if they can keep 2m away from pupils and other staff  Finally, the first minister confirmed she was to scale back the daily coronavirus briefings to three days a week over the next fortnight. So we'll be back on Tuesday with our live page. Until then, take care and stay safe. Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland No assembly, no school shows or choirs, no large groups and no parents in school buildings. That's the future envisaged when pupils return on 11 August, according to one Edinburgh headmaster. But Rod Grant, of Clifton Hall
School, believes schools are ready for a return without social distancing, as now envisaged by the Scottish government, because they had already prepared for a more strict regime. He admits that it is difficult to predict what the requirements might be as the science changes ahead of 11 August but tells BBC Radio Scotland: ""I would like to see it as it was before, but obviously with some
increased hygiene practices in place and some strict adherence to rules over
illness."" Scottish schools had initially been preparing for a combination of home and school learning and Mr Grant adds: ""I am more concerned about what education might look like if there is a second wave of the virus in the autumn. Going back to blended learning would be horrific as I don't think kids are enjoying that."" Five things you need to know about the coronavirus outbreak this Thursday evening. Also announced today was a childminding workforce support fund of Â£11.2m to help childminders experiencing financial problems because of coronavirus. Deputy First Minister John Swinney told this lunchtime's briefing that, if the virus continues to be suppressed, he would expect the ""bubbles model"" restricting children to small groups will not be needed - nor will a ban on blending, which would allow parents to then use more than one childcare setting. Graeme McAllister, the chief executive of the Scottish Childminding Association, welcomes the announcement in principle. ""We've been moving further and further away from the small group model...and, when schools reopen, its going to be on the large group model,"" he says. ""And what we were really looking for and were arguing for was parity for childminding."" He says parents and childminders need the restrictions to be lifted fully, not just eased, adding that childminders and other key workers must be able to pick up children from both nurseries and schools. ""If that's not allowed, it will become meaningless,"" he adds. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Larry Flannagan, general secretary of Scotland's biggest teaching union, the EIS, told Lunchtime Live earlier that there is some apprehension among his members about the government's announcement that there is unlikely to be physical distancing in schools when pupils return in August. Jane Peckham, of the NASUWT teaching union, agrees and suggests this ""level of anxiety has to be recognised"" and suggests concerns are mainly about ""the logistics"" involved. ""The lack of physical distancing for young people relies very heavily on all the hygiene measures being in place,"" she points out. ""But, in reality, if you have 500 young people and staff who have to wash their hands or sanitise on entering the building or every time they change a location, that's a massive logistical exercise."" Ms Peckham also highlights the fact that it is suggested ""anyone who wishes to wear a face covering should be able to do so"" and thinks that see-through visors should be considered. Pupils will not have to physically distance when Scotland's schools return in August, but teachers will, new advice to the government has suggested. Ministers have set a target for schools toreopen in full from 11 August. A new report from advisers said ""no distancing"" should be required between pupils in primary or secondary schools. But it said staff should stay 2m (6ft 6in) apart from each other, and put on face coverings when coming into closer contact with children. Read more here. Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland From tomorrow, people who are shielding in Scotland are to be allowed to stay in holiday accommodation and visit outdoor markets, ina change to advice. Couples who do not live together can also meet up without distancing, while the first minister said the need for shielding could be paused entirely at the end of this month. Holly McCormack who has severe asthma, lives alone and has been shielding for the
duration of lockdown. ""The biggest change for me has been forming an extended household group and being able to hug my niece,"" she tells BBC Radio Scotland. ""Having that physical contact makes up for everything else."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Unemployment in Scotland rose between March and May One
man who knows all too well about the struggles of young people out of work is Graeme Armstrong from Lanarkshire. He has turned his life around after years of being
involved in gang culture and drugs and has written a book about his experiences
to prevent other young men going down the same destructive path. ""All the social issues we see come from a lethal absence of hope,"" he tells BBC Radio Scotland. ""If you are a young man or woman in our deprived communities, you leave school with no job to go to. We're fantastic at telling young people what not to do, but we never tell them what to do."" Mr Armstrong would like to see more emphasis on vocational training in schools. ""Life skills are as important as academic skills,"" he says. Unemployment in Scotland rose between March and May as the impact of lockdown was felt,official figures indicate,external. Scotland's unemployment rate rose to 4.3% in the period, a 0.6% increase on the previous quarter. This was higher than theUK unemployment rate of 3.9%. The number of unemployed Scots was up by 15,000 to 120,000. About 28,000 left jobs but were not looking for new work. However, the figures were not as high as many feared due to the number of people on furlough. Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Education Secretary John Swinney Pupils will not have to physically distance when Scotland's schools return in August, but teachers will, new advice to the government has suggested. The Scottish government's revised plan for a return to school has left Anne, who is part of a shielding household with two teenage children, confused and concerned. She claims on BBC Radio Scotland that Education Secretary John Swinney appeared to contradict himself after first saying that all children would no longer need to physically distance. He pointed out that detailed plans were yet to be drawn up, but Anne says of his answers to journalists: ""He specifically said that fourth, fifth and sixth years were termed as young adults and in a greater risk category than other pupils. He then went on to talk about online learning and the possibility of that being used in the autumn."" Anne, who lives in Aberdeenshire, points out that her fourth and fifth year children previously travelled to school in a 16-seater mini-bus - a journey of an hour each way. ""You have exposure of your child to other people from 15 other households,"" he adds. ""We are a shielded household and the shielded person is being exposed to all those risks.""

An appeal to help the world's most vulnerable through the coronavirus pandemic was launched by the UK's Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC) earlier this week. Fourteen charities - including Oxfam, Christian Aid, Islamic Relief and the British Red Cross - will join together to ask the British public to donate. The UK government will double the first Â£5m of donations. Much of the money will go to refugee camps, where overcrowding and poor sanitation allows the virus to spread. DEC's website,externalprovides more details of its coronavirus appeal and its other current appeals. The low level of exposure to coronavirus in the population highlights the care needed in easing lockdown, it has been warned. Economy Secretary Fiona Hyslop says the Scottish government will provide an additional Â£100m
for employment support and training. Ms Hyslop revealed at least Â£50m of that funding will be set aside to help young people get into work. Today's job figures showed the number ofunemployed Scots was up by 15,000 to 120,000. About 28,000 left jobs but were not looking for new work. The measures announced by the Scottish government include a job guarantee for young people, a new national retraining scheme, and
more funding to provide immediate assistance and advice if people are made
redundant. In addition, Fair
Start Scotland, the government's employment support service, has been extended by a further
two years to March 2023. Ms Hyslop has also asked Sandy Begbie to develop an implementation plan for a
job guarantee for young people, as recommended by the Advisory Group on
Economic Recovery. The government will set out more detail on that plan in early
August. Citizens Advice Scotland has said inquiries about redundancy have risen steeply since lockdown was imposed and nearly 750,000 Scots were put on furlough. Advice was given on more than 500 occasions in April, nearly 700 times in May and it was given to more than 1,400 people in June, with the July rate running at a higher level still. Meanwhile, the number of Scots claiming benefits linked to unemployment has more than doubled since March, according to the latest figures from the office for National Statistics, although they are described as 'experimental'. Including those on Jobseekers Allowance, and some of those claiming Universal Credit while seeking work, the number rose from 111,000 in March, to 215,000 last month. There was only a small rise between May and June.  Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Charity boss to head government race commission,"This video can not be played Dr Tony Sewell on heading UK race commission The government has named Tony Sewell as chair of its new commission looking into race disparity in the UK. The formation of the body was announced in June by Boris Johnson in the wake of anti-racism protests following the death of George Floyd. Mr Sewell said the commission would ""seek to inform a national conversation about race, led by the evidence"". But the Muslim Council of Britain said he was the wrong choice as he was ""keen on downplaying race disparities"". The prime minister said Mr Sewell shared his ""commitment to maximising opportunity for all"". The commission is tasked with looking at all aspects of inequality, including criminal justice, education, employment and health. It will report back directly to Mr Johnson with its findings by the end of the year. But Labour's shadow women and equalities secretary, Marsha de Cordova, said most of the evidence the commission would examine had already come to light in previous reviews on race, calling for ""action on the structural racism that we already know exists"" as a priority. The Liberal Democrat's equalities spokeswoman, Christine Jardine, also called for the PM to ensure any recommendations from the commission ""don't just sit and gather dust"". Labour pushes for details on race commission UK must do 'much more' to tackle racism, says PM PM accused of misleading MPs on race review response Now the boss of education charity Generating Genius, Mr Sewell worked with the PM in 2013 when he was Mayor of London, leading his education inquiry into the capital's schools, and sat on the Windrush working group. He is a longstanding commentator on racial issues and education, attracting criticism from some quarters for his views, such as claiming boys were being failed by schools becauselessons had become too ""feminised"",external. He also saidan anti-intellectual Afro-Caribbean youth culture,externalwas one of the reasons girls performed better than boys in school. And,writing in Prospect magazine in 2010,external, he said ""much of the supposed evidence of institutional racism is flimsy"". The BBC's community affairs correspondent, Rianna Croxford, reported that he was understood to be in line for the role earlier on Thursday. After the appointment was confirmed, Mr Sewell said: ""I have spent my entire career in education striving to help all students achieve their full potential. ""I know however that inequality exists, and I am committed to working with my fellow commissioners to understand why."" The commission was announced following Black Lives Matter protests held across the UK Analysis by BBC political correspondent Leila Nathoo This commission had its sceptics from the moment it was announced. Some opposition MPs and organisations working on race equality were uneasy about Boris Johnson's comments that he wanted to ""change the narrative"" on race and ""stop a sense of victimisation and discrimination"". There was also concern one of the prime minister's closest aides, Munira Mirza, who's been overseeing the setting up of the commission, had previously questioned whether structural racism existed. Tony Sewell, who's now been chosen as chair, has written in support of both of these views. As Downing Street was working to recruit the commission's members, I understand that a number of prominent figures in the black community - who did not want to be identified publicly - sought to distance themselves from the process. Sources said some who'd been reluctant to pursue discussions with the government regarded the commission as ""toxic"" and a way for ministers to ""play for time"" or ""pay lip service"" to the idea of race equality. A government spokesperson said: ""It is untrue to suggest that a number of prominent Black individuals have rejected the opportunity to be a part of the commission."" The choice is sure to be a controversial one but it's clear the government wants to make a break from what has come before. The Equalities Minister, Kemi Badenoch, said the commission will ""inform and improve"" the conversation about race - but the question will be, how much it can achieve if it doesn't have the full support of the communities its working to help? The commission will face high levels of scrutiny after accusations another government review into race is a distraction from the issue. The other members confirmed for the commission are: Dr Maggie Aderin-Pocock - scientist and co-presenter of BBC's The Sky at Night Keith Fraser - chair of the Youth Justice Board for England and Wales Dr Samir Shah -  CEO of Juniper TV, former BBC journalist and former chair of The Runnymede Trust Lord Ajay Kakkar -  Professor of Surgery at University College London Dr Dambisa Moyo - international economist and author Martyn Oliver - CEO of Outwood Grange Academies Trust Naureen Khalid - co-founder of online national school governor forum UkGovChat Aftab Chughtai - co-founder of the campaign group Muslims for Britain, member of the Grenfell Tower Taskforce and chair of West Midlands Police Independent Advisory Group Mercy Muroki - senior policy researcher and columnist. A spokesman for the Muslim Council of Britain condemned the appointments, saying: ""The composition of the government's commission on race disparities sends a strong signal about its intentions. Many are partisans of a culture war keen on downplaying race disparities. ""Tony Sewell's appointment clearly demonstrates this. The composition of this commission tells us that the government intends to row back on previous work to tackle racial disparities."" Speaking to BBC News, Mr Sewell said he did believe ""racism exists in structures"", but added: ""I do think some of the disparities there may not have origins in race. They could be rooted in class, different geographies, or different powers. ""We need to examine that... and take an intellectually wider view of this, rather than a narrow view.""

In Greater Manchester 2,933 people have died, according to available data up to 3 July. Addressing the small congregation, the Very Reverend Rogers Govender said: ""We are a grieving world, a grieving city. ""We hope this will make a difference to you spiritually, emotionally and otherwise. Your loved one is a precious human being, whose life is cherished."" Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham spoke at the service Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham said each person who had fallen victim to the virus should be remembered as ""a person and not just a statistic"". ""These were people who looked after us when we were growing up, people who taught us, people who cleaned our streets, our hospitals, our offices, our churches, who drove our buses, trams and trains, who poured our pints, shared our food and shared a joke as they did it,"" he said.

Russians interfered in UK's 2019 election â Raab,"This video can not be played Dominic Raab: ""Reasonable confidence"" Russia tried to interfere in 2019 election Russians almost certainly sought to interfere in the 2019 UK general election through illicitly acquired documents, the government has said.

The committee heard evidence from independent experts as well as the secret intelligence agencies, MI5, MI6 and GCHQ. BBC security correspondent Gordon Corera said the committee's report has looked into Russian activity from traditional espionage to subversion - with a particular focus on possible interference in the 2016 EU referendum and 2017 general election. In addition to cyber-espionage and social media campaigns, the report also examines Russian influence through money. The delay in publication has led to speculation the report contains details embarrassing for the Conservatives - specifically in relation to the party's Russian donors. However, Commons leader Jacob Rees-Mogg insisted the hold-up was due to a number of committee members leaving Parliament and the need ""to make sure that the right people with the right level of experience and responsibility could be appointed"". Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said Mr Raab's statement was ""ambiguous"" and ""confusing"". She said Mr Raab had said there was ""no evidence of full-scale interference"" by Russia in his statement but had also claimed ""any attempts of such interference are unacceptable"".

"UK payrolls shrink by 649,000 jobs in lockdownOfficial figures reveal a drop in the number in employment, with young people hard hit.","The number of workers on UK company payrolls fell by 649,000 between March and June, official figures indicate. The overall jobless rate was unchanged but there are 47,000 more young people unemployed than there were a year ago. Unemployment has not surged, as many feared, because large numbers of firms have put employees on the government-backed furlough scheme. But economists say the full effect on employment will not be felt until the scheme ends in October. The headline unemployment rate hasn't budged since the lockdown was introduced. It stayed at 3.9% between March and May, unchanged on the previous three months. The number of people claiming work-related benefits last month - including the unemployed - is also marginally lower at 2.6 million. Why is the jobless rate not rising? But because of the effect of the furlough scheme on the employment market, analysts say the number of hours worked per week is currently a truer reflection of the impact of the coronavirus crisis. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said that since the start of the pandemic, total weekly hours worked in the UK had fallen by a record 175.3 million, or 16.7%, to 877.1 million hours. ""This was the largest annual decrease since estimates began in 1971, with total hours dropping to its lowest level since May to July 1997,"" the ONS added. The number of Britons on payrolls - which means people employed by a company and does not include the self-employed - fell by 2.2% in June compared with March. Young people are being especially badly hit. ""The estimated number of people unemployed aged 16 to 24 years increased by 47,000 on the year, while other age groups remained steady,"" the ONS said. This video can not be played Four experts offer advice to people looking for a job Many young people are employed in the hospitality industry, which was largely shut down from 23 March. The retail sector, another source of jobs for younger people, has also been hard hit by the lockdown. A fifth of all of those claiming out-of-work benefits, 514,770, are aged between 18 and 24. The number of young new claimants who have signed on between March and June is 276,000 - more than doubling over three months. BBC analysis has found there are now constituencies with nearly 20% of their young population on Universal Credit or Jobseeker's Allowance - including Walton in Liverpool and south Blackpool. Even affluent areas such as south-west Surrey, Henley and Windsor have seen a quadrupling in the number of young claimants under lockdown, though many of these are likely to have become eligible to claim as a result of being furloughed. According to the Resolution Foundation, one-third of 18 to 24-year-old employees have lost jobs or been furloughed during the pandemic, compared to one in six adults above that age. There are not many jobs around for anyone. Vacancies in the UK in April to June 2020 are at the lowest level since the survey began in April to June 2001, at an estimated 333,000. ""This is 23% lower than the previous record low in April to June 2009,"" the ONS said. The ONS added that a larger than usual number of those losing their jobs were not currently searching for another one and were therefore economically inactive rather than unemployed, while some longer-term unemployed people had stopped looking for work. A survey by the British Chambers of Commerce said 29% of businesses expected to cut jobs in the next three months. It called for a reduction in employers' National Insurance contributions to protect businesses and jobs. The government's spending watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility, has warned that in the worst-case scenario,unemployment could rise to four million. Danielle Skinner, 23, of Hollinwood, Oldham. was made redundant from her first job at the start of this month. She had been in full-time work since November last year at a digital marketing firm, having been kept on after doing an apprenticeship. Danielle Skinner has applied for more than 50 jobs since being made redundant At first, she was put on furlough. ""But then, as things progressed and businesses started to make people redundant, it did give me an inkling that this was something possibly that was going to happen to me,"" she told the BBC. ""I felt heartbroken personally, because I'd just started to get my career going and I felt like everything was just falling to pieces. Despite her distress, Danielle says she doesn't blame the company: ""The business has to survive and if they didn't take immediate action, then the business could have gone into administration and then there would be no jobs."" She has already applied for 50 or so jobs and has only had one or two responses, which she finds very disheartening. ""It does get me down, I am struggling to find a job, but nevertheless I do try and remain positive and optimistic, thinking, 'I am employable and someone one day will employ me and I'll enjoy the job so much.'"" There's a storm coming: the government's official number-crunchers - the Office for Budget Responsibility - have warned that unemployment could hit four million this year. But the bulk of that is yet to hit the numbers. The normal counts of employment have been propped up by support schemes: more than 11 million private sector workers are still on the government payroll. Those plans have been very effective in staving off a greater crisis as lockdown hit. The looming turmoil and hardship is clear however, with average real pay - that's after inflation - 1.3% lower than a year ago in May and the number of job vacancies at a record low. The number of people counting as self-employed has fallen a record 178,000. As employers now look towards the winding down of support schemes, the announcements of layoffs are now multiplying.Despite the chancellor's new plan, a big rise in joblessness still seems inevitable. The challenge is to getting people back into work - particularly younger ones, the group most likely to have been furloughed. Lengthy unemployment, especially at the start of a career, can blight livelihoods and prospects for decades. And while the economy is opening up, the uncertain outlook may make employers reluctant to do the same with hiring. Business Secretary Alok Sharma said he had ""enormous sympathy"" for people who found themselves out of work. ""I know it's going to be very, very difficult for lots of people as a result of this. The best thing we can do is continue to open up the economy in a phased manner and a cautious manner and get businesses up and running again,"" he told the BBC. He said the cost of inaction would have been ""far greater"" than the action the government had taken. Bridget Phillipson, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said every lost job was ""a personal tragedy now and a hammer blow to public finances in the long run"". She accused the chancellor of taking a ""blanket approach"" rather than targeting the sectors worst affected by the crisis. How have you been affected?

'Better public transport' needed for M4 congestion,"This video can not be played ""Motorway charge may be necessary"" Better public transport is needed to provide an alternative to the scrapped M4 relief road, a panel of experts says. Some form of charging could also be a way to ease traffic, the South East Wales Transport Commission said. But alternatives such as reopening rail lines would need to be in place first, according to the report. The,externalat rush hour but Wales' first ministerscrapped a relief road planlast year. The report highlighted that people may be reluctant to use crowded public transport after the coronavirus pandemic and many may continue to work from home - so any long term predictions about traffic levels are not possible. It said a ""network of alternatives"" was needed, with a ""local rail backbone"" - more stations between Cardiff and Severn Tunnel Junction. Many people were using the motorway because they had no other realistic option, with journeys to and from Newport particularly poorly served, it found. But the different ways of working that have emerged during the coronavirus pandemic give a period of ""breathing space"". And the pandemic is now leading the committee to look in more detail at flexible working arrangements. Sophie Howe was appointed the first Future Generations Commissioner for Wales in 2016 Future Generations Commissioner for Wales Sophie Howe welcomed the idea of improving public transport, and called for more investment in the green economy. ""Wales didn't need a Â£1.6bn motorway a year ago and it doesn't need one now,"" she said. ""We need green jobs, industries and infrastructure to recover from the pandemic, and protect ourselves against the uncertainties of another crisis in the form of the climate and nature emergency."" But businesses which rely on the M4 say any charge to use the motorway would make them less competitive globally. Kath Lewis says a charge to use the M4 would add ""huge additional costs"" to businesses in the region ""All our components - down to the wires, the minutest of components - are delivered to us via freight,"" said Kath Lewis, director of Industrial Automation and Control, based in Newport. ""[There would be] huge additional cost to the business which would make us slightly less competitive in the global market. ""I think it's tough enough at the moment without adding additional barriers."" Mark Drakeford axed the relief road scheme in June last year because of its cost and impact on the environment, after ministersdeclared a climate emergency. He added he would not have gone ahead even if it was affordable because of the impact on theGwent Levelswaterways, which are home to rare birds and other species. Environmentalists opposed the now-axed plans for the new motorway Congestion on the M4 is largely a peak hours, commuting problem The M4 around Newport is the fourth most congested stretch of urban motorway in the UK Parts of the motorway have been operating at or close to their practical capacity Most commuting cars carry only one traveller Between Newport and Bristol, there are about 23,300 daily journeys The panel said the root cause of the congestion was because many places like housing estates, workplaces and retail parks had been located close to the motorway, without meaningful transport alternatives. ""In the absence of more developed transport alternatives, the motorway has been a natural point around which to plan developments,"" the report said. Prime minister has 'no say' on the M4 relief road What is it like to live near the M4? Lockdown 'reigniting a love for cycling' It added with Cardiff and Newport planning for physical and economic growth, congestion was likely to increase. ""Without transport alternatives, the design of many of these developments risks reinforcing car dependency rather than encouraging modal shift to public transport or active travel,"" it said. The panel found while there is a good rail service between Cardiff, Newport and Bristol centres, the majority of trips do not just involve city centres. The M4 relief road was proposed as a solution to tackling congestion around Newport ""As such, there is insufficient rail provision to offer a genuine alternative to the motorway."" It added the bus network does not serve travel patterns well either, and are not coordinated with train services in the majority of cases. The report suggested ""integrated ticketing"" and a coordinated timetable. Similar to buses, active travel - cycling or walking - is insufficiently integrated with the wider transport network, the report says. It highlights there is no dedicated active travel route between Newport station and the major employment sites in the city, and no commuter cycle route between Cardiff and Newport. Local authorities appear to have focussed on improving routes from suburban areas into centres, rather than traffic-free routes between council areas, it says. Before the pandemic, the panel said it expected to say traffic would grow in the medium term - but there is ""significant uncertainty"" regarding both the medium and long term now. It said stakeholders had already deemed a ""fundamental change in working behaviours"" necessary to end the traditional 09:00 to 17:00 office working. But there has been a slow, gradual increase since a dramatic fall in traffic at the end of March, as restrictions have begun to be relaxed - and the experts expect this to continue. It said traffic will rise ""even if everyone who can work from home continues to do so"". This video can not be played This video reveals the possible route of the M4 relief road Public transport capacity significantly falls with social distancing - by as much as between 70% and 90%. And car occupancy rates may also fall if public health guidance advises against car sharing. ""We therefore expect an increase in the number of single occupancy cars on the M4,"" the report said. What happens in the long term is uncertain, the report said, dependant on which behaviours revert to their pre-epidemic states. Key questions include: What will be the long-term impact of home working once social distancing measures are removed? Will people be willing to use crowded services in the future? Will more people be willing to walk or cycle to work as a result of their experiences? What will the public transport industry look like, financially, once the crisis interventions have been unwound? But it estimated the changes will not fundamentally change the long-term need for more transport options. The ""breathing space"" from the pandemic can be used to put good alternatives to the motorway in place. The report concludes that ""some sort of charging mechanism is necessary"" to encourage people to use public transport, cycle or walk. It also points out a charge could provide revenue funding for transport services. However, it said it would be difficult to introduce such measures before new transport alternatives are in place. The panel, which was set up to look at alternative solutions to the congestion after the relief road was scrapped, will issue a final report with specific recommendations for the Welsh Government by the end of the year.

Imposing post-Brexit trade rules 'damaging to Wales',"The Welsh and UK governments have clashed in a new row over how trade rules will operate post-Brexit. UK government plans ask all four nations to acceptÂ rules and standardsÂ set by each other to ensure trade remains seamless across the UK. The Welsh Government said it had not seen the plans and any system forced on Wales would be ""deeply damaging"". UK Business Secretary Alok Sharma said the plans continued ""hundreds of years"" of a ""seamless internal UK market"". The Welsh Government negotiated an agreement with the UK government in 2018 that means powers in areas such as food labelling, support for farmers and energy efficiency - currently regulated at EU level - will return to Cardiff. The UK government has however said that devolved administrations will have to recognise the rules of all four nations, so as not to harm trade within the UK. In a policy paper, it says this will ensure a level playing field for all firms regardless of which UK nation they are in, to ensure a UK-wide ""internal market"". Mr Sharma told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast with Claire Summers: ""What we are proposing today in the white paper is a continuation of what's happened over hundreds of years which is a seamless UK internal market."" He said the devolved administrations ""have known the direction of travel"" and the UK government would be ""engaging with colleagues extensively across all the devolved administrations and getting their views."" He added: ""The UK has some of the highest standards when it comes to the environment, animal welfare, food safety, and that is not going to change."" The Welsh Government said while it supported the principle of seamless trade any rules must be agreed by the devolved nations. A spokesman said: ""Any new system must have independent oversight and dispute resolution. ""Unfortunately, the UK government has not managed to share the paper with us, and Welsh ministers have had no recent discussions with the UK government on these issues. ""Any attempt to unilaterally impose a system will be deeply damaging."" Covid-19 and Brexit talks 'a nightmare' Post-Brexit immigration plan 'doesn't work for Wales' But Welsh Secretary Simon Hart said Wales was a ""vital part"" of the UK's single marketplace and 75% of Welsh goods were consumed in the rest of the UK. ""Securing this internal market will ensure this trade remains seamless, safeguarding thousands of Welsh jobs,"" he said. ""It is vital for our shared prosperity and our ability to bounce back from the pandemic that people, products, ideas and investment continue to flow unhindered throughout the UK."" During a Commons statement on the legislation, Plaid Cymru MP Hywel Williams called it a ""power-grab"" transferring ""vast powers over devolved areas to Tory ministers"". ""Thirty-five years ago, in 1985, the then Tory European Commissioner's white paper detailed 300 legislative proposals to complete the European Single Market and that with a seven-year deadline,"" he said. ""On the 'UK Internal Market', this Tory government is giving a four-week consultation over the summer. ""Persuasive evidence, were it needed, that the UK internal market is first and foremost a convenient headline - a veneer lacking detail or a legal basis."" After Welsh ministers had complained about a lack of consultation and not seeing the proposals before they were made public, it emerged that the Welsh Government had cancelled a meeting that would have given the first minister a briefing on the plans. A spokesperson for the Welsh Government said: ""Given the significance of the changes the UK government is planning to impose on Wales, we asked for a copy of the paper ahead of any meeting with the secretary of state for Wales. ""This would have allowed for a more meaningful discussion on these deeply damaging changes. ""Regrettably, this did not happen."" This is really all about who gets to decide things such as food standards after EU rules stop applying at the end of the year. Ministers in Cardiff Bay are concerned about a hollowing out of devolution by the back door. Take the proposal for a "" mutual recognition principle"" as an example -.. they say it effectively means the lowest common denominator wins because every UK home nation has to recognise every other home nation's standards. So in the trade negotiations with the US - the proverbial chlorinated chicken issue - if  the UK government negotiated a trade deal with the US allowing lower standard food into England, the Welsh Government couldn't stop it coming into Wales. But the UK government insist they will protect British food and farming standards in the negotiations so the issue won't arise.

Russian interference in UK election 'almost certain',"This video can not be played Dominic Raab: ""Reasonable confidence"" Russia tried to interfere in 2019 election Russians almost certainly sought to interfere in the 2019 UK general election through illicitly acquired documents, the government has said. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said any attempt to meddle in UK democracy was ""completely unacceptable"". The documents - on UK-US trade discussions - emerged online and were used by Labour in the 2019 campaign. A much-delayed report into allegations of wider Russian interference into UK democracy is due next week. Labour said it condemned ""any attempt by Russia, or any foreign power, to interfere in our country's democratic processes"" and pledged to work to protect the nation's security. This is the first time the government has acknowledged with such certainty that Russians interfered in the UK's democratic processes. A Downing Street spokesman dismissed as ""nonsense"" suggestions that the timing of Mr Raab's statement was aimed at pre-empting the publication of the Russia report by Parliament's Intelligence and Security Committee. Kuenssberg: Curious timing of Russian meddling claims Can UK election meddling be linked to the Kremlin? Five things we learned from leaked trade papers At the 2019 election, then-Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the documents proved the Conservatives were planning to include the NHS in a future trade agreement with the US - something denied by the government. Writing on his Facebook page, Mr Corbyn accused the Conservatives of wanting ""to distract from the damage a Trump trade deal would do to our NHS by continuing to push the bogus claim Labour received Russian support"". He added that the government's claim ""is an attempt to divert attention from the threat to the NHS and the Tory party links to Russian oligarchs expected to be revealed in the long-buried parliamentary Russia report."" The government launched an inquiry into how the papers got into the public domain, with help from the National Cyber Security Centre. The announcement comes asa group of national security services warnthat Russian hackers are targeting organisations trying to develop a coronavirus vaccine. Despite many suspicions of Russian attempts at meddling in the referendum and other campaigns, significant concrete evidence is in short supply. So, it matters that this is the first time a UK minister has made an explicit link to Russia, in one way or another, trying to meddle in elections in the UK. But the timing of that statement creates its own intrigue too. Next week, at long last, the powerful group of MPs who monitor UK intelligence will publish a report on the Russian threat to the UK - a report that has been anticipated for a very long time and may perhaps set the record straight on all of this. Is it politically convenient for ministers to acknowledge the threat themselves just before others may make embarrassing claims about it? Labour politicians have frequently accused the Conservatives of ignoring Russian interference because of their relationship with Tory Party donors. Did it suit the government to publicise the claims that material used by Labour was also manipulated by Russia? It seems, as one former UK ambassador to Moscow said, a ""remarkable coincidence"" that the government decided at this moment to admit explicitly, for the first time, that Russia has tried to stick its nose into our politics - especially when there is a running criminal investigation into who obtained the documents to start with. But Downing Street denies that there is any link in the timing at all. Read more from Laura here. In a written ministerial statement, Mr Raab said ""the government has concluded that it is almost certain that Russian actors sought to interfere in the 2019 general election through the online amplification of illicitly acquired and leaked government documents. He said the documents were disseminated online via the social media platform Reddit. ""When these gained no traction, further attempts were made to promote the illicitly acquired material online in the run up to the general election,"" he said. The foreign secretary goes on to say that there is ""no evidence of a broad spectrum Russian campaign against the general election"" but that ""any attempt to interfere in our democratic processes is completely unacceptable"". The forum website Reddit said the unredacted papers had been uploaded as ""part of a campaign that has been reported as originating from Russia"". It suspended 61 accounts that showed a ""pattern of coordination"". Mr Raab's statement is not connected to the Intelligence and Security Committee's report into Russian interference, which is due to be published next week. Jeremy Corbyn holds up the leaked documents at a press conference on 27 November The committee launched its inquiry in November 2017 following concern Russia sought to influence the US 2016 election and the 2016 Brexit vote. Afterthe poisoning of ex-Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yuliain March 2018 the investigation became the ""primary focus"" of the committee. The committee heard evidence from independent experts as well as the secret intelligence agencies, MI5, MI6 and GCHQ. BBC security correspondent Gordon Corera said the committee's report has looked into Russian activity from traditional espionage to subversion - with a particular focus on possible interference in the 2016 EU referendum and 2017 general election. In addition to cyber-espionage and social media campaigns, the report also examines Russian influence through money. The delay in publication has led to speculation the report contains details embarrassing for the Conservatives - specifically in relation to the party's Russian donors. However, Commons leader Jacob Rees-Mogg insisted the hold-up was due to a number of committee members leaving Parliament and the need ""to make sure that the right people with the right level of experience and responsibility could be appointed"". Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said Mr Raab's statement was ""ambiguous"" and ""confusing"". She said Mr Raab had said there was ""no evidence of full-scale interference"" by Russia in his statement but had also claimed ""any attempts of such interference are unacceptable"".

Why some women support terror,"Shamima Begum was 15 and living in Bethnal Green, London, when she left the UK in 2015 When women make the news because of terrorism, the focus has often been on their role as victims or as potential allies in countering the threat. By contrast, women who take part in and support extremism have sometimes been overlooked. This changed when runaway teenager Shamima Begum was described as the ""poster girl"" for Islamic State after beingtracked down at a Syrian refugee camp. Four years ago, she left the UK with two friends to join IS, but claims she was ""just a housewife"". Nevertheless, the UK home secretarystripped her of UK citizenship, saying: ""If you back terror, there must be consequences"". She isset to be granted legal aidto appeal the decision. Ms Begum's case has raised a number of questions on women's active and willing participation in violent extremism both in IS and other groups. Rusi analysis suggests that 17% ofextremist recruits in Africa,externalare women, while separate research has indicated 13% ofIS foreign recruits,externalin Iraq and Syria are female. The exact figures remain vague and could be far higher. Shamima Begum (right) with two school friends, Amira Abase and Kadiza Sultana, at Gatwick Airport in 2015 A number of Rusi-backed studies and others have investigated the roles women play in organisations such as IS and al-Shabab,one of the deadliest militant groups in Africa. Researchers interviewed women who had been directly or indirectly involved with al-Shabab's activities, to find out how they were recruited, and the impact that taking part in violent extremist activity has on women. The work was conducted by academics in Kenya, who were able to use their long-standing experience and networks within communities identified to be at risk of radicalisation. IS v al-Shabab The roles played by women vary between groups. Women in al-Shabab have often held what could be seen as more traditional roles, as wives of fighters and domestic help. They are also sometimesmade to work as sex slaves. They can also help attract new members.One study,externalin Kenya discovered women were lured by others who promised them jobs, financial support and counselling. For example, Hidaya (not her real name), a dressmaker, was recruited by a client who offered to invest in and expand her business. She was persuaded to travel to a border region, from where she was smuggled into Somalia. Within IS, women often recruit - especially online - and play an active role in projecting the group's beliefs. In Shamima Begum's case, her recruitment could beseen by IS as a propaganda victory, despite her suggestion that she had done little more in Syria than take care of her husband and children. Women under IS are also allowed to serve as doctors and healthcare workers, with certain restrictions, while the group has anall-female morality police force,external. More recently, as the grouplost its territory in Iraq and Syria, it has been willing to place women in frontline roles, using its newspaper al-Nabato call women to jihad,external, andreleasing a video last year,externalshowing several in combat in Syria. Sally-Anne Jones became a recruiter for IS and travelled to Syria, where she was thought to have been killed in a drone strike in 2017 However, differences between groups have become increasingly blurred as organisations become ""inspired"" by each other. In Somalia, where al-Shabab is attempting to establish an Islamic state governed by Sharia (Islamic law), cases of female frontline or suicide fightershave also been seen. Analysis of al-Shabab suicide attacks between 2007 and 2016found 5% were carried out by women.,external This is also the case in other parts of Africa, such as Nigeria where militant Islamist group Boko Haram hasused women as suicide bombers. Who are Somalia's al-Shabab? After the caliphate: Has IS been defeated? How do you deradicalise someone? Islamic State: The women and children no-one wants There are a number of factors driving women's recruitment into these groups. To an extent, it appears that what motivates men also works for women, such as the pull of strong ideology and financial benefits. However, tactics aimed specifically at women also emerged, such as the appeal of returning to traditional gender roles. For instance,one of our studies indicated,externalal-Shabab recruiters preyed on the insecurities of some young Muslim women who feared that higher education would delay their marriage prospects. ""If I get a man who will marry and protect me, why should I stress myself with studies or education?"", one Nairobi University student asked researchers. Others appear to have been initially attracted by promises of jobs, money and other opportunities. However, discerning their motives for joining is difficult. Many of the women we interviewed claimed they had been recruited against their will. Like Shamima Begum, some claimed they either weren't actively involved in the group's activities, or else took part against their will. Some say they were victims. While some are likely to have been coerced in some form, denying responsibility is a useful way to try to reintegrate back into the larger community. More like this Why known extremists can carry out terror attacks The strange normality of life in a breakaway state The ordinary people making the world more right-wing There are a number of rehabilitation approaches applied to former or returning fighters, but few that are aimed specifically at women. Policymakers and security services need to take thespecific issues women leaving extremist organisations have,externalinto account when devising prevention, rehabilitation and reintegration strategies. For example, many will have had children with dead or absent fighters, while others will require counselling for trauma stemming from rape and sexual assault. It is critical that governments address these issues when engaging with the female role in violent extremism. This would start with better understanding of how gender-based differences fuel women's involvement and the specific impact it has on their lives. This would benefit their communities by managing the risk they present and helping to prevent more women from joining extremist groups.

Russian election interference 'almost certain',"This video can not be played Dominic Raab: ""Reasonable confidence"" Russia tried to interfere in 2019 election Russians almost certainly sought to interfere in the 2019 UK general election through illicitly acquired documents, the government has said. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said any attempt to meddle in UK democracy was ""completely unacceptable"". The documents - on UK-US trade discussions - emerged online and were used by Labour in the 2019 campaign. A much-delayed report into allegations of wider Russian interference into UK democracy is due next week. Labour said it condemned ""any attempt by Russia, or any foreign power, to interfere in our country's democratic processes"" and pledged to work to protect the nation's security. This is the first time the government has acknowledged with such certainty that Russians interfered in the UK's democratic processes. A Downing Street spokesman dismissed as ""nonsense"" suggestions that the timing of Mr Raab's statement was aimed at pre-empting the publication of the Russia report by Parliament's Intelligence and Security Committee. Kuenssberg: Curious timing of Russian meddling claims Can UK election meddling be linked to the Kremlin? Five things we learned from leaked trade papers At the 2019 election, then-Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the documents proved the Conservatives were planning to include the NHS in a future trade agreement with the US - something denied by the government. Writing on his Facebook page, Mr Corbyn accused the Conservatives of wanting ""to distract from the damage a Trump trade deal would do to our NHS by continuing to push the bogus claim Labour received Russian support"". He added that the government's claim ""is an attempt to divert attention from the threat to the NHS and the Tory party links to Russian oligarchs expected to be revealed in the long-buried parliamentary Russia report."" The government launched an inquiry into how the papers got into the public domain, with help from the National Cyber Security Centre. The announcement comes asa group of national security services warnthat Russian hackers are targeting organisations trying to develop a coronavirus vaccine. Despite many suspicions of Russian attempts at meddling in the referendum and other campaigns, significant concrete evidence is in short supply. So, it matters that this is the first time a UK minister has made an explicit link to Russia, in one way or another, trying to meddle in elections in the UK. But the timing of that statement creates its own intrigue too. Next week, at long last, the powerful group of MPs who monitor UK intelligence will publish a report on the Russian threat to the UK - a report that has been anticipated for a very long time and may perhaps set the record straight on all of this. Is it politically convenient for ministers to acknowledge the threat themselves just before others may make embarrassing claims about it? Labour politicians have frequently accused the Conservatives of ignoring Russian interference because of their relationship with Tory Party donors. Did it suit the government to publicise the claims that material used by Labour was also manipulated by Russia? It seems, as one former UK ambassador to Moscow said, a ""remarkable coincidence"" that the government decided at this moment to admit explicitly, for the first time, that Russia has tried to stick its nose into our politics - especially when there is a running criminal investigation into who obtained the documents to start with. But Downing Street denies that there is any link in the timing at all. Read more from Laura here. In a written ministerial statement, Mr Raab said ""the government has concluded that it is almost certain that Russian actors sought to interfere in the 2019 general election through the online amplification of illicitly acquired and leaked government documents. He said the documents were disseminated online via the social media platform Reddit. ""When these gained no traction, further attempts were made to promote the illicitly acquired material online in the run up to the general election,"" he said. The foreign secretary goes on to say that there is ""no evidence of a broad spectrum Russian campaign against the general election"" but that ""any attempt to interfere in our democratic processes is completely unacceptable"". The forum website Reddit said the unredacted papers had been uploaded as ""part of a campaign that has been reported as originating from Russia"". It suspended 61 accounts that showed a ""pattern of coordination"". Mr Raab's statement is not connected to the Intelligence and Security Committee's report into Russian interference, which is due to be published next week. Jeremy Corbyn holds up the leaked documents at a press conference on 27 November The committee launched its inquiry in November 2017 following concern Russia sought to influence the US 2016 election and the 2016 Brexit vote. Afterthe poisoning of ex-Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yuliain March 2018 the investigation became the ""primary focus"" of the committee. The committee heard evidence from independent experts as well as the secret intelligence agencies, MI5, MI6 and GCHQ. BBC security correspondent Gordon Corera said the committee's report has looked into Russian activity from traditional espionage to subversion - with a particular focus on possible interference in the 2016 EU referendum and 2017 general election. In addition to cyber-espionage and social media campaigns, the report also examines Russian influence through money. The delay in publication has led to speculation the report contains details embarrassing for the Conservatives - specifically in relation to the party's Russian donors. However, Commons leader Jacob Rees-Mogg insisted the hold-up was due to a number of committee members leaving Parliament and the need ""to make sure that the right people with the right level of experience and responsibility could be appointed"". Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said Mr Raab's statement was ""ambiguous"" and ""confusing"". She said Mr Raab had said there was ""no evidence of full-scale interference"" by Russia in his statement but had also claimed ""any attempts of such interference are unacceptable"".

Loans for universities about to go bust,"Universities have warned of financial losses from the pandemic Universities in England at risk of going bust could apply for emergency loans from the government, in plans announced by the education secretary. But any rescue would come with conditions, including cutting pay for vice chancellors and senior staff. It could also require universities to focus more on subjects with better job prospects for graduates. A report from the Institute for Fiscal Studies warned that 13 unnamed universities were facing insolvency. Universities have warned of cash problems from the coronavirus pandemic - particularly if overseas students cancel plans to study in the UK. A recent analysis from the Institute for Fiscal Studieswarned of a ""significant financial threat""to the UK's higher education system from the pandemic - with losses that could be between Â£3bn and Â£19bn. To avoid the collapse of a university and disruption to students, the government has put forward ""last resort"" plans for how it will intervene. Covid fears putting off Chinese students from studying in UK 13 universities at risk of going bust Universities call for emergency funding There are no guarantees of support, or as the proposals say - ""not all providers will be prevented from exiting the market"" - but universities could be offered a repayable loan, which would come with ""restructuring"" conditions. Universities are autonomous organisations, but the rescue packages would see the government exerting more control over what was taught and how money was spent. There could be cost cutting through ""closing unviable campuses"" and mergers, including with further education colleges. Universities would be expected to end courses seen as being of ""low value"", with an emphasis on either high-quality research or courses with good job prospects. There have been warnings of the financial risks if many Chinese students cancel plans to study in the UK Vocational and higher technical courses could be encouraged - and universities would be expected to offer courses more closely linked to the local economy. ""Vice-chancellor pay has for years faced widespread public criticism,"" say the proposals, with an expectation that there would be limits on salaries for senior staff. Universities would have to ""strip back on bureaucracy"" and any funding for student unions should be for the ""wider student  population rather than subsidising niche activism"", say the plans for the ""restructuring regime"". Jo Grady of the UCU lecturers' union accused the government of ""exploiting"" financial difficulties to narrow what universities offered and to impose its ""evidence-free ideology"". The lecturers' leader criticised an ""obsession with graduate earnings as a sole measure of quality"". Alistair Jarvis, chief executive of Universities UK, called on the government to be ""more ambitious, to go beyond a small number of universities in financial need"" and to extend the funding more widely. The government has previously announced measures to support universities during the pandemic - including bringing forward tuition fee income and promising that ""research-intensive"" universities could receive loans to cover 80% of international student losses. ""This new scheme will help those who are still facing financial difficulty as a result of Covid-19,"" said Education Secretary Gavin Williamson.

A recent analysis from the Institute for Fiscal Studieswarned of a ""significant financial threat""to the UK's higher education system from the pandemic - with losses that could be between Â£3bn and Â£19bn. To avoid the collapse of a university and disruption to students, the government has put forward ""last resort"" plans for how it will intervene. Covid fears putting off Chinese students from studying in UK 13 universities at risk of going bust Universities call for emergency funding There are no guarantees of support, or as the proposals say - ""not all providers will be prevented from exiting the market"" - but universities could be offered a repayable loan, which would come with ""restructuring"" conditions. Universities are autonomous organisations, but the rescue packages would see the government exerting more control over what was taught and how money was spent. There could be cost cutting through ""closing unviable campuses"" and mergers, including with further education colleges. Universities would be expected to end courses seen as being of ""low value"", with an emphasis on either high-quality research or courses with good job prospects. There have been warnings of the financial risks if many Chinese students cancel plans to study in the UK Vocational and higher technical courses could be encouraged - and universities would be expected to offer courses more closely linked to the local economy. ""Vice-chancellor pay has for years faced widespread public criticism,"" say the proposals, with an expectation that there would be limits on salaries for senior staff. Universities would have to ""strip back on bureaucracy"" and any funding for student unions should be for the ""wider student  population rather than subsidising niche activism"", say the plans for the ""restructuring regime"". Jo Grady of the UCU lecturers' union accused the government of ""exploiting"" financial difficulties to narrow what universities offered and to impose its ""evidence-free ideology"". The lecturers' leader criticised an ""obsession with graduate earnings as a sole measure of quality"". Alistair Jarvis, chief executive of Universities UK, called on the government to be ""more ambitious, to go beyond a small number of universities in financial need"" and to extend the funding more widely. The government has previously announced measures to support universities during the pandemic - including bringing forward tuition fee income and promising that ""research-intensive"" universities could receive loans to cover 80% of international student losses. ""This new scheme will help those who are still facing financial difficulty as a result of Covid-19,"" said Education Secretary Gavin Williamson.

Boohoo told to address exploitation claims,"Online retailer Boohoo has been criticised by MPs who say it has failed to address claims of exploitation at factories in  Leicester. Philip Dunne MP said he found it ""incredible"" Boohoo was surprised by allegations of poor working conditions. Boohoo had said it was ""shocked and appalled"",externalby reports that workers had been paid as little as Â£3.50 per hour. But Mr Dunne suggested the firm was already aware of the issues. Boohoo said it would respond ""in due course"". The firm's co-founder, and then-chief executive, Carol Kane appeared in front of the Environmental Audit Committee (EAC) of MPs in 2018 over links Boohoo ""may have to illegally low pay in Leicester garment factories"". ""It is incredible that over a year since the committee highlighted illegal working practices in its supply chain, Boohoo has publicly denied any knowledge of what has been happening for years,"" Mr Dunne, who is chair of the EAC, wrote in a letter to the company. ""It is shameful that it took a pandemic and the ensuing outrage about working practices in their supply chain for Boohoo finally to be taken to task for turning a blind eye,"" he said. Last week, Boohoo - which also owns the Pretty Little Thing brand - faced a backlash after a report claimed workers at a Leicester factory that supplied clothes to Boohoo were paid just Â£3.50 an hour, while being offered no protection from coronavirus. The national minimum wage for people over 25 years-old is Â£8.72 an hour. Boohoo also owns PrettyLittleThing, which has collaborated with celebrities like Little Mix The fashion firm ordered an independent review of its UK supply chainas a result, which will by led by Alison Levitt QC, a barrister specialising in business crime and financial services.

"Shielding in Wales to be paused on 16 AugustThe chief medical officer says vulnerable people can ""gradually resume day-to-day life"".Wales","This video can not be played Dr Frank Atherton said people shielding ""can gradually resume day-to-day life"" Those most at risk from coronavirus can stop shielding after 16 August, Wales' chief medical officer has said. Around 130,000 people in Wales with underlying health conditions have been advised to stay indoors since the start of the pandemic to protect themselves. At the coronavirus briefing on Thursday, Dr Frank Atherton said such people in at-risk groups would be able to go to work, school or the shops. He said they ""can gradually resume day-to-day life"". Dr Atherton added the measures would be kept under review in case of a rise in transmission levels. Coronavirus: Who should be shielding? The billions being spent on coronavirus in Wales People shielding in Wales to be allowed outdoors He said it was still very important that people in the shielding group continued to pay strict attention to physical distancing and good hand hygiene. Some of the support which has been made available for those shielding will end, such as the weekly food box scheme -a direct food delivery service which is currently provided for people shielding. But supermarkets will continue to offer priority delivery slots for those who are deemed particularly vulnerable to coronavirus. A prescription delivery service will remain in place until 30 September, said Dr Atherton, who added he will be writing to everyone in the shielding group. People who are shielding will be sent a letter updating them on the latest situation Dr Atherton said the NHS in Wales will keep an up to date list of those who have been shielding, because ""we just don't know what's round the corner"". He added the Welsh Government may have to reinstate ""some form"" of shielding in the future, if the virus increases in Wales. ""It may be - we hope not - but it may be we may have to reinstitute some form of shielding in the future,"" he said. ""If we do that, it may not be exactly the same group, there's a piece of work going on at a UK level to do a better risk assessment so that we have a clearer idea of who really will benefit."" Shadow health minister Angela Burns MS said it was ""welcome news"" for the thousands of people who have been ""cut off from family, friends, work, school and any sense of a normal life."" But she added lifting restrictions on a Sunday seemed strange. ""For those who have been effectively isolated for months, were the pause from the Friday, or even the Saturday, that extra day could mean so much to people,"" she said. Lee Dirkzwager says she did not enjoy it when she had to go to the bank One woman who has been shielding since March said she feels it is still too soon. Lee Dirkzwager, 72, from Cardiff, has a number of underlying conditions, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. She said she briefly went out to go to the bank, but ""didn't enjoy it"". ""I'm trying to stay away from people and people are walking past you with no masks - it's not nice,"" she said. ""I think it's going to be a lot longer before I want to go out."" Thosemost at risk,externalof coronavirus, including: Solid organ transplant recipients Some people with cancer who are undergoing treatments such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy People on immunosuppression drugs Women who are pregnant and have heart disease People with severe respiratory conditions - cystic fibrosis, severe asthma and COPD Some people with rare diseases such as severe combined immunodeficiency Helen Iliff created badges to remind people about social distancing. As those shielding prepare to slowly return to normal life, a trainee anaesthetist has designed a pin badge encouraging others to keep their distance. Helen Iliff, who works at Prince Charles Hospital, Merthyr Tydfil, created the badge while she herself was shielding. ""It's been very exciting and I like to think I've made the most of the time shielding,"" she said. ""It's not just about giving people the confidence to go out; it's also about our wider understanding of personal responsibility and respect for others. ""It's not that people aren't willing to engage with social distancing, but we are tiring after so long in lockdown and people forget."" The symbol of a shield has been printed on 130,000 badges to be distributed at health boards across Wales. Lanyards, stickers and other merchandise,externalhas also been produced. Badges with the image of a yellow shield are being distributed across the NHS in Wales England -The 2.2m people who have been self-isolating in England during the pandemicwill no longer need to shield from 1 August.They are already able to meet outdoors in a group with up to five others and form ""support bubbles"" with other households. Scotland- The 180,000 people currently shielding in Scotland are to be allowed to stay in holiday accommodation and visit outdoor markets and gardens from Friday,in a change to advice announced on Thursday. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said it was hoped the need for shielding could be paused entirely at the end of July. Northern Ireland- The 80,000 people deemed to be at most risk from coronavirus will be able to go outside again whenthe shielding period ends on 31 July.

Imposing post-Brexit trade rules 'damaging to Wales'The Welsh Government says UK ministers must get four-nation consent for post-Brexit arrangements.,"The Welsh and UK governments have clashed in a new row over how trade rules will operate post-Brexit. UK government plans ask all four nations to acceptÂ rules and standardsÂ set by each other to ensure trade remains seamless across the UK. The Welsh Government said it had not seen the plans and any system forced on Wales would be ""deeply damaging"". UK Business Secretary Alok Sharma said the plans continued ""hundreds of years"" of a ""seamless internal UK market"". The Welsh Government negotiated an agreement with the UK government in 2018 that means powers in areas such as food labelling, support for farmers and energy efficiency - currently regulated at EU level - will return to Cardiff. The UK government has however said that devolved administrations will have to recognise the rules of all four nations, so as not to harm trade within the UK. In a policy paper, it says this will ensure a level playing field for all firms regardless of which UK nation they are in, to ensure a UK-wide ""internal market"". Mr Sharma told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast with Claire Summers: ""What we are proposing today in the white paper is a continuation of what's happened over hundreds of years which is a seamless UK internal market."" He said the devolved administrations ""have known the direction of travel"" and the UK government would be ""engaging with colleagues extensively across all the devolved administrations and getting their views."" He added: ""The UK has some of the highest standards when it comes to the environment, animal welfare, food safety, and that is not going to change."" The Welsh Government said while it supported the principle of seamless trade any rules must be agreed by the devolved nations. A spokesman said: ""Any new system must have independent oversight and dispute resolution. ""Unfortunately, the UK government has not managed to share the paper with us, and Welsh ministers have had no recent discussions with the UK government on these issues. ""Any attempt to unilaterally impose a system will be deeply damaging."" Covid-19 and Brexit talks 'a nightmare' Post-Brexit immigration plan 'doesn't work for Wales' But Welsh Secretary Simon Hart said Wales was a ""vital part"" of the UK's single marketplace and 75% of Welsh goods were consumed in the rest of the UK. ""Securing this internal market will ensure this trade remains seamless, safeguarding thousands of Welsh jobs,"" he said. ""It is vital for our shared prosperity and our ability to bounce back from the pandemic that people, products, ideas and investment continue to flow unhindered throughout the UK."" During a Commons statement on the legislation, Plaid Cymru MP Hywel Williams called it a ""power-grab"" transferring ""vast powers over devolved areas to Tory ministers"". ""Thirty-five years ago, in 1985, the then Tory European Commissioner's white paper detailed 300 legislative proposals to complete the European Single Market and that with a seven-year deadline,"" he said. ""On the 'UK Internal Market', this Tory government is giving a four-week consultation over the summer. ""Persuasive evidence, were it needed, that the UK internal market is first and foremost a convenient headline - a veneer lacking detail or a legal basis."" After Welsh ministers had complained about a lack of consultation and not seeing the proposals before they were made public, it emerged that the Welsh Government had cancelled a meeting that would have given the first minister a briefing on the plans. A spokesperson for the Welsh Government said: ""Given the significance of the changes the UK government is planning to impose on Wales, we asked for a copy of the paper ahead of any meeting with the secretary of state for Wales. ""This would have allowed for a more meaningful discussion on these deeply damaging changes. ""Regrettably, this did not happen."" This is really all about who gets to decide things such as food standards after EU rules stop applying at the end of the year. Ministers in Cardiff Bay are concerned about a hollowing out of devolution by the back door. Take the proposal for a "" mutual recognition principle"" as an example -.. they say it effectively means the lowest common denominator wins because every UK home nation has to recognise every other home nation's standards. So in the trade negotiations with the US - the proverbial chlorinated chicken issue - if  the UK government negotiated a trade deal with the US allowing lower standard food into England, the Welsh Government couldn't stop it coming into Wales. But the UK government insist they will protect British food and farming standards in the negotiations so the issue won't arise.

Chinese economy bounces back into growth,"China's economy grew 3.2% in the second quarter following a record slump. The world's second biggest economy saw a sharp decline in the first three months of the year during coronavirus lockdowns. But figures released on Wednesday show China's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) returned to growth during April to June. The numbers are being closely watched around the world as China restarts its economy. The figure is higher than experts were predicting and points towards a V-shaped recovery - that is, a sharp fall followed by a quick recovery. It also means China avoids going into a technical recession - signified as two consecutive periods of negative growth. China's economy shrinks for first time in decades China scraps annual growth target for first time China attacks UK's 'groundless' Huawei 5G ban The bounce-back follows a steep 6.8% slump in the first quarter of the year, which was the biggest contraction since quarterly GDP records began. The country's factories and businesses were shutdown for most of this period as China introduced strict measures to curb the spread of the virus The government has been rolling out a raft of measures to help boost the economy, including tax breaks. This video can not be played Why does Chinaâs economy matter to you? Analysis by Mariko Oi, BBC News, Singapore The Chinese economy managed to grow more strongly than expected as it emerged from the lockdown. All the stimulus measures announced by the authorities seem to be working - with factories getting busier, evident in growth in the industrial production data. But one sector that hasn't recovered as quickly as they had hoped is retail sales. They still fell in the second quarter - and getting people spending again will remain a challenge. And just as the economy starts to recover, tensions with the US are flaring up - especially over Hong Kong. That is why some economists are reluctant to call it a V-shaped recovery just yet. A research note from Deutsche Bank said the ""V-shaped recovery"" was ""largely completed"". ""Consumer spending is still below its pre-Covid path, but the remaining gap is largely concentrated in a few sectors - travel, dining, leisure services-- where rapid recovery is unlikely,"" it added. In May, China announced it would not set an economic growth goal for 2020 as it dealt with the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic. It is the first time Beijing has not had a gross domestic product (GDP) target since 1990 when records began. For the first six months of the year, China's economy fell  1.6%, its National Bureau of Statistics said.

'My once-in-lifetime holiday hasn't been refunded',"Lynn and Martin Fox are still waiting for a refund Lynn and Martin Fox had remortgaged their home to pay for a holiday of a lifetime with their two children in Florida, only for coronavirus and bad luck to ruin their plans. The couple finished paying for the holiday in January, but Mrs Fox, 42, then lost her cabin crew job at Flybe when the airline collapsed in March. Weeks later, as the virus lockdown took hold, work dried up for her husband, a pipe-fitter. Then the holiday, planned for late April, was cancelled. ""We thought the refund would be money in the bank, but then panic started to set in,"" said Mrs Fox. Can I get travel insurance and what are my travel rights? Coronavirus: Package holiday firms told to sharpen up on refunds Coronavirus: 'First Ryanair agreed to a refund, then it didn't' Their refund of Â£6,700 from Virgin Holidays did not arrive. They had little in income, waited weeks for benefits after making a universal credit application, as well as another wait for a government self-employment support grant to come through. ""If only they [Virgin Holidays] would have been honest with us and communicated with us, we would have been happy. If they put a date on the refund, we could have planned,"" she said. ""But the phone cut off calls and emails were ignored."" Last week, the UK's competition authority wrote a letter to more than 100 holiday companies, telling them to speed up their coronavirus refunds process Consumer association Which? says this is far from a unique case. It has built up a dossier of 14,000 complaints from people struggling to obtain refunds for cancelled flights or holidays. The consumer group said this was just ""a snapshot of the problem"", which it claimed was putting people under ""serious financial and emotional distress"". Virgin Holidays said that Mr and Mrs Fox's refund was in a queue. A company spokeswoman said that it continued to be ""inundated with an unprecedented volume of refund requests"" and had increased capacity to deal with these cases. She said refund payments were being taken in date order and would be processed within ""an absolute maximum of 120 days"", from the date the refund was requested. However, this means that waits for a refund far exceeded the legal deadline of 14 days for package holidays. Refunds for cancelled flights are supposed to come within seven days. When the Virgin Atlantic airline, part of the same stable,finalised a rescue dealin recent days, its chief executive Shai Weiss said: ""Despite the incredible efforts of our teams, through cancelled flights and delayed refunds we have not lived up to the high standards we set ourselves, but we will do everything in our power to earn back their trust."" Those involved in 12,600 cases, involving a range of companies and analysed by Which?, have collectively spent nearly six years trying to chase their refunds. The consumer group said these complainants were Â£5.6m out of pocket, at an average of Â£446 each. If you have a package holiday cancelled by the provider, then a refund should be provided for the whole holiday within 14 days If your flight is cancelled, you are entitled to a full refund to the original form of payment within seven days, although many airlines are struggling to meet that deadline. You can accept, or refuse, vouchers or a rebooking but a voucher will probably be invalid if the airline later goes bust If you decide against going on a future flight, which is not yet cancelled, then there is no right to a refund. Different airlines have different rules over what you can do, but many are waiving any charges for changing to a later flight or having a voucher instead. Your travel insurance is unlikely to cover you Airlines acknowledged there have been delays in refunding customers due to the volume of applications, but insisted they were issuing pay-outs. Which? has passed the complaints to the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), which it urged to take ""urgent enforcement action"". Rory Boland, of Which? Travel, said: ""These latest figures are a damning indictment of the behaviour of many airlines and holiday companies in recent weeks. ""With customers being told to either wait months for theirÂ moneyÂ back or accept a voucher that may prove worthless if a company fails, it should come as a surprise to no one that trust has plummeted so drastically. ""Any further delay risks permanent damage to trust in the travel industry."" The CAA told the BBC that it is now reviewing the refund policies and performance of airlines. ""We value the input we have received directly from consumers, as well as those that were sent to us via consumer organisations,"" said CAA spokesman Andrew McConnell. ""We acknowledge the importance of this and will publish the findings of our review in due course."" Last week, the UK's competition authority wrote a letter to more than 100 holiday companies, telling them tospeed up their coronavirus refunds process. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said that some firms had misled customers about their refund rights. A spokeswoman for Abta, which represents the package holiday sector, said companies were themselves facing delays from airlines in refunding them the flight element of any holiday. They had also mutually agreed with many customers to postpone, rather than cancel, holidays.

Banks urge 'student-type loans' to stop job cuts,"UK banks fear up to 800,000 firms employing 3 million could go bust in the next year if they cannot defer repayments on government-backed loans. The lending industry is proposing a student loans-type scheme, where coronavirus loans can be converted into a tax debt repayable over a decade. Like student loans, the money would only be repayable when and if the businesses can afford it. Banks want the scheme to be administered by HM Revenue and Customs. HMRC would have the operational horsepower, existing relationships with, and adequate knowledge of, companies to manage a programme of this scale. Banking industry lobby group TheCityUK is proposing to set up a ""UK Recovery Corporation"", through which companies could convert their short-term debts into a longer term financial obligation to HMRC and  pay back the debt when they are making enough money - a so-called contingent tax obligation. This, the banks argue, would be far simpler and faster to arrange and administer, than the UK government taking direct ownership stakes in hundreds of thousands of companies. Rishi Sunak defends furlough bonus scheme Coronavirus: UK faces 'explosive' debt levels Coronavirus: Chancellor Rishi Sunak unveils Â£30bn plan to save jobs There has been widespread acknowledgement that many firms will struggle to repay the Â£46bn in loans taken out so far, under government schemes designed to help business survive the coronavirus crisis. Government guarantees of between 80-100% are to the lender, not the borrower. This means that the banks may get repaid by the government, but companies in trouble will still be in default and therefore likely to go bust. Put simply, government guarantees to lenders will not save the firms doing the borrowing, or their employees. The appeal to the banking industry is that they will not incur the reputational damage of having to pursue small businesses for repayment for loans that are already largely guaranteed by the government. And the government will not be left with accelerated losses when the banks write off the loan and call in their government guarantees. The banking sector argues that the scheme would be a better alternative to government rescue deals If such a scheme were to be introduced, firms would be able to defer debt interest repayments that start coming due in March 2021, at a time when they will have already faced a backlog of VAT and business rate bills, plus the expiration of the job retention scheme, which has seen the government pay 80% of over 9 million people's wages. In time, say the banks, these IOUs from business could be parcelled up and sold to investors, much like the bundles of student loan debt and bad loans from the financial crisis have been, thus taking it off the government's hands. The government is already on the hook for most of this debt through their coronavirus loan guarantees to the banks. The banks would also relish the opportunity of earning any fees associated with arranging these sales. The Treasury described the proposals as ""a useful contribution to discussions on how businesses can be best supported through this difficult time"". However, on Tuesday, the Chancellor said the bar for government intervention was ""very high"" and should be ""exceptionally rare and only in situations where companies have some strategic value, clearly have a long-term viable future and where the creditors and shareholders have shared in the burden and are not just looking for a free ride on the taxpayer"". The financial services industry counter that this would not amount to a direct ownership stake and that the government has already clearly recognised that a jobs apocalypse is on the horizon. Without a means of converting a short-term debt emergency into a longer-term repayment plan, it will arrive by March next year. These proposals are unlikely to be the final answer. They could be subject to abuse - like any large and fast intervention. For example, there should surely be some strings attached so that firms could not pay their own shareholders fat dividends having parked their debts for the time being. Many will also scoff at the nerve of the banks to try and offload the problem from their balance sheet to the taxpayers after what happened a decade ago. But to be clear, the government has already guaranteed most of these debts. It's already the taxpayer's problem. Sooner or later the government will be left with a massive bill for this crisis. The banks argue that the later the bill comes, the smaller it will be for the taxpayer and the smaller the damage to the social fabric of the UK.

Why is the unemployment rate not rising?,"The Labour government has announced a series of measures to get more people into jobs, arguing that it has inherited a country that ""isn't working"". Its plans, announced by Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, include overhauling the health and disability benefits system and improving mental health support. About a quarter of the working age population - those aged 16 to 64 - do not currently have a job. That's about 11 million people. According to the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS),4.3% of people were unemployed in the period between July and September 2024,external, which is about 1.5 million people. While this figure has risen over the last two years, unemployment remains relatively low by historical standards. However, the unemployed represent only a small part of the nearly 11 million working-age people who don't have a paid job. About 9.3 million of them are not called ""unemployed"". That is because they are not actively looking for work, or available to start a job. Insteadpeople in this group are called ""economically inactive"",external. In fact, more of them say they want a job - 1.9 million people - than are officially unemployed - 1.5 million. That means there are far more people who say they are available to or want to work than there are vacancies - 0.8 million. And thenumber of vacancies,externalhas been falling consistently for the last two years. It varies according to age. ONS figures for 2023 show that most of the 2.7 million ""inactive"" under-25s were students. The majority of them did not want a job. You can see that in the graphic below. Click on the darker border surrounding any age group to see the spilt between men and women. Your device may not support this visualisation Things are different in other age groups. Among 25- to 49-year-olds, 1.1 million people did not work because of caring responsibilities, about a million of whom are women. Nearly one million people in this age group were not working because of illness - more evenly split between men and women. The main reasons that 3.5 million over-50s were out of the job market were illness and early retirement. Almost nobody who retired early said they wanted to return to work. Aroundhalf of people with disabilities,externaldid not have a paid job, a rate that is more than double the rest of the working-age population. Less than a quarter of those who were sick or caring said they wanted a job. Sick people leaving workforce at record highs Many people are not looking for work because they are studying, caring or have retired. Some people want to work but cannot, either becausechildcare is too expensiveor they are not well enough. As the chart below shows, caring responsibilities and ill-health are the most common reasons for inactivity given by those who would like a paid job. Chart on the reason inactive people wanting to work don't The number of people not working has a broader effect. A smaller workforce means the government raises lessincome tax and National Insurance, which it uses to pay for services like the NHS. It may also spend more on benefits. Since people on benefits generally have less money than those in work, it also means less spending on the high street. That in turn is bad for businesses, and can affect how many people they employ, which can mean there are fewer jobs for those who do want to work. During the Covid pandemic, all major countries saw their workforce shrink. But while many other leading economies have since recovered, the UK still has more people out of its workforce than it did in 2019. There is a debate about how much of this is down toproblems with how we work out how many people are inactive,external. Before Covid, the UK's ""inactivity rate"" was the second lowest inthe G7 club of leading economies, behind Japan. The increase in the inactive population since then, if accurate, would now place the UK behind the US, France and Italy. The independentOffice for Budget Responsibility,external- which assesses how well the UK economy is doing - has suggested that ill-health has consistently been a bigger factor in the UK than in other advanced economies. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer hasset out a plan to get two million more people into work. The proposals include: overhauling the health and disability benefits system to better support people to get jobs and stay in work rebranding job centres as the National Jobs and Careers Service offering every 18 to 21-year-old in England an apprenticeship, training or education opportunities or help to find a job as part of a new ""Youth Guarantee"" an independent review of what UK employers are doing to promote health and inclusive workplaces providing more money for the North East, South Yorkshire and West Yorkshire to stop people leaving work because of ill health expanding mental-health support and efforts to tackle obesity. The prime minister said the reforms would ""put an end to the culture of blaming and shaming people who for too long haven't been getting the support they need to get back to work"". But many details of what they will mean in practice have not been confirmed, and a review of sickness benefits will not begin until 2025. The proposals follow widespread criticism from businesses thatthe increase in National Insurance announced in the Budget, coupled withthe rise in the minimum wage, will make it harder for them to create new jobs. Companies warn this will undermine the government's goal of increasing the working population.

Why women support terror,"Shamima Begum was 15 and living in Bethnal Green, London, when she left the UK in 2015 When women make the news because of terrorism, the focus has often been on their role as victims or as potential allies in countering the threat. By contrast, women who take part in and support extremism have sometimes been overlooked. This changed when runaway teenager Shamima Begum was described as the ""poster girl"" for Islamic State after beingtracked down at a Syrian refugee camp. Four years ago, she left the UK with two friends to join IS, but claims she was ""just a housewife"". Nevertheless, the UK home secretarystripped her of UK citizenship, saying: ""If you back terror, there must be consequences"". She isset to be granted legal aidto appeal the decision. Ms Begum's case has raised a number of questions on women's active and willing participation in violent extremism both in IS and other groups. Rusi analysis suggests that 17% ofextremist recruits in Africa,externalare women, while separate research has indicated 13% ofIS foreign recruits,externalin Iraq and Syria are female. The exact figures remain vague and could be far higher. Shamima Begum (right) with two school friends, Amira Abase and Kadiza Sultana, at Gatwick Airport in 2015 A number of Rusi-backed studies and others have investigated the roles women play in organisations such as IS and al-Shabab,one of the deadliest militant groups in Africa. Researchers interviewed women who had been directly or indirectly involved with al-Shabab's activities, to find out how they were recruited, and the impact that taking part in violent extremist activity has on women. The work was conducted by academics in Kenya, who were able to use their long-standing experience and networks within communities identified to be at risk of radicalisation. IS v al-Shabab The roles played by women vary between groups. Women in al-Shabab have often held what could be seen as more traditional roles, as wives of fighters and domestic help. They are also sometimesmade to work as sex slaves. They can also help attract new members.One study,externalin Kenya discovered women were lured by others who promised them jobs, financial support and counselling. For example, Hidaya (not her real name), a dressmaker, was recruited by a client who offered to invest in and expand her business. She was persuaded to travel to a border region, from where she was smuggled into Somalia. Within IS, women often recruit - especially online - and play an active role in projecting the group's beliefs. In Shamima Begum's case, her recruitment could beseen by IS as a propaganda victory, despite her suggestion that she had done little more in Syria than take care of her husband and children. Women under IS are also allowed to serve as doctors and healthcare workers, with certain restrictions, while the group has anall-female morality police force,external. More recently, as the grouplost its territory in Iraq and Syria, it has been willing to place women in frontline roles, using its newspaper al-Nabato call women to jihad,external, andreleasing a video last year,externalshowing several in combat in Syria. Sally-Anne Jones became a recruiter for IS and travelled to Syria, where she was thought to have been killed in a drone strike in 2017 However, differences between groups have become increasingly blurred as organisations become ""inspired"" by each other. In Somalia, where al-Shabab is attempting to establish an Islamic state governed by Sharia (Islamic law), cases of female frontline or suicide fightershave also been seen. Analysis of al-Shabab suicide attacks between 2007 and 2016found 5% were carried out by women.,external This is also the case in other parts of Africa, such as Nigeria where militant Islamist group Boko Haram hasused women as suicide bombers. Who are Somalia's al-Shabab? After the caliphate: Has IS been defeated? How do you deradicalise someone? Islamic State: The women and children no-one wants There are a number of factors driving women's recruitment into these groups. To an extent, it appears that what motivates men also works for women, such as the pull of strong ideology and financial benefits. However, tactics aimed specifically at women also emerged, such as the appeal of returning to traditional gender roles. For instance,one of our studies indicated,externalal-Shabab recruiters preyed on the insecurities of some young Muslim women who feared that higher education would delay their marriage prospects. ""If I get a man who will marry and protect me, why should I stress myself with studies or education?"", one Nairobi University student asked researchers. Others appear to have been initially attracted by promises of jobs, money and other opportunities. However, discerning their motives for joining is difficult. Many of the women we interviewed claimed they had been recruited against their will. Like Shamima Begum, some claimed they either weren't actively involved in the group's activities, or else took part against their will. Some say they were victims. While some are likely to have been coerced in some form, denying responsibility is a useful way to try to reintegrate back into the larger community. More like this Why known extremists can carry out terror attacks The strange normality of life in a breakaway state The ordinary people making the world more right-wing There are a number of rehabilitation approaches applied to former or returning fighters, but few that are aimed specifically at women. Policymakers and security services need to take thespecific issues women leaving extremist organisations have,externalinto account when devising prevention, rehabilitation and reintegration strategies. For example, many will have had children with dead or absent fighters, while others will require counselling for trauma stemming from rape and sexual assault. It is critical that governments address these issues when engaging with the female role in violent extremism. This would start with better understanding of how gender-based differences fuel women's involvement and the specific impact it has on their lives. This would benefit their communities by managing the risk they present and helping to prevent more women from joining extremist groups.

"Jobless figures 'not showing full extent of crisis'Unemployment increased by 34,000 in April to reach 1.3 million, according to official data.BusinessComments","The way the UK reports unemployment may not reflect the ""true scale of joblessness"", says a think tank. Unemployment rose by 34,000 in April to reach 1.3 million, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). But the Resolution Foundation argues that the 23% drop in average hours worked between early March and late April is a better indicator of unemployment. The ONS said it publishes a large selection of analysis on employment. Official numbers on how many people are out of work and claiming unemployment benefits will be published on Thursday. Chancellor warns of 'tough times' for UK economy Sunak unveils Â£30bn plan to save jobs Virus crisis expected to 'level down' UK economy Resolution Foundation chief economist Mike Brewer said: ""Britain is in the midst of an unprecedented economic shock that is profoundly affecting millions of people's jobs. ""Unemployment is forecast to hit 4 million for the first time ever. And yet our official data is failing to show the true extent of this jobs crisis."" On Tuesday, the government's budgetary watchdog, the Office for Budgetary Responsibility (OBR), projected thatunemployment could reach 4 million,externalpeople, if the UK's economic recovery is poor, up from 1.3 million in 2019in its latest analysis. Meanwhile, data for people claiming benefits soared to 2.3 million for April. But these figures could include some people who are eligible to claim support while still employed. The ONS said: ""Enhancements to Universal Credit, as part of the UK government's response to the coronavirus, mean that an increasing number of people became eligible for unemployment-related benefit support, although still employed."" The Resolution Foundation says this data is not a good reflection of the true picture either because it includes furloughed workers who initially made a claim when the crisis first struck. The think tank says it estimates that ""fewer than half (700,000) of the 1.6 million increase in the claimant count between March and May is related to people who are newly out-of-work, and not receiving furlough pay or self-employed grants from the government"". It urges the ONS to make more of its ability to count the number of workers who are employed and not temporarily without work, alongside the headline employment rate, as this would provide ""a far more accurate picture of labour market activity"". The ONS said it agreed that data on hours worked was an important component in understanding the unemployment picture in the UK. ""However, our detailed Labour Force Survey estimates are based on interviews with tens of thousands of people and provide vital detail not available from any other source,"" it said in a statement. ""It is difficult to interpret claimant count figures, as we know these include some people in work."" ""Measuring the labour market, like many areas of the economy, presents additional challenges at the moment, especially with so many people furloughed. That is why the ONS has introduced new surveys and data sources to provide the best possible indicators of the impact of the pandemic. "" Separately, the British Chambers of Commerce is warning that almost a third of UK businesses (28%) they surveyed expect to cut jobs in the next three months. The figure compares to last year, when only 7% expected to do so. Some 7,400 firms took part in the BCC survey, which found more than a quarter of the firms (28%) said they had already shrunk their workforces since the pandemic began.

""It is difficult to interpret claimant count figures, as we know these include some people in work."" ""Measuring the labour market, like many areas of the economy, presents additional challenges at the moment, especially with so many people furloughed. That is why the ONS has introduced new surveys and data sources to provide the best possible indicators of the impact of the pandemic. "" Separately, the British Chambers of Commerce is warning that almost a third of UK businesses (28%) they surveyed expect to cut jobs in the next three months. The figure compares to last year, when only 7% expected to do so. Some 7,400 firms took part in the BCC survey, which found more than a quarter of the firms (28%) said they had already shrunk their workforces since the pandemic began.

"UK payrolls shrink by 649,000 jobs in lockdownOfficial figures reveal a drop in the number in employment, with young people hard hit.Business","The number of workers on UK company payrolls fell by 649,000 between March and June, official figures indicate. The overall jobless rate was unchanged but there are 47,000 more young people unemployed than there were a year ago. Unemployment has not surged, as many feared, because large numbers of firms have put employees on the government-backed furlough scheme. But economists say the full effect on employment will not be felt until the scheme ends in October. The headline unemployment rate hasn't budged since the lockdown was introduced. It stayed at 3.9% between March and May, unchanged on the previous three months. The number of people claiming work-related benefits last month - including the unemployed - is also marginally lower at 2.6 million. Why is the jobless rate not rising? But because of the effect of the furlough scheme on the employment market, analysts say the number of hours worked per week is currently a truer reflection of the impact of the coronavirus crisis. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said that since the start of the pandemic, total weekly hours worked in the UK had fallen by a record 175.3 million, or 16.7%, to 877.1 million hours. ""This was the largest annual decrease since estimates began in 1971, with total hours dropping to its lowest level since May to July 1997,"" the ONS added. The number of Britons on payrolls - which means people employed by a company and does not include the self-employed - fell by 2.2% in June compared with March. Young people are being especially badly hit. ""The estimated number of people unemployed aged 16 to 24 years increased by 47,000 on the year, while other age groups remained steady,"" the ONS said. This video can not be played Four experts offer advice to people looking for a job Many young people are employed in the hospitality industry, which was largely shut down from 23 March. The retail sector, another source of jobs for younger people, has also been hard hit by the lockdown. A fifth of all of those claiming out-of-work benefits, 514,770, are aged between 18 and 24. The number of young new claimants who have signed on between March and June is 276,000 - more than doubling over three months. BBC analysis has found there are now constituencies with nearly 20% of their young population on Universal Credit or Jobseeker's Allowance - including Walton in Liverpool and south Blackpool. Even affluent areas such as south-west Surrey, Henley and Windsor have seen a quadrupling in the number of young claimants under lockdown, though many of these are likely to have become eligible to claim as a result of being furloughed. According to the Resolution Foundation, one-third of 18 to 24-year-old employees have lost jobs or been furloughed during the pandemic, compared to one in six adults above that age. There are not many jobs around for anyone. Vacancies in the UK in April to June 2020 are at the lowest level since the survey began in April to June 2001, at an estimated 333,000. ""This is 23% lower than the previous record low in April to June 2009,"" the ONS said. The ONS added that a larger than usual number of those losing their jobs were not currently searching for another one and were therefore economically inactive rather than unemployed, while some longer-term unemployed people had stopped looking for work. A survey by the British Chambers of Commerce said 29% of businesses expected to cut jobs in the next three months. It called for a reduction in employers' National Insurance contributions to protect businesses and jobs. The government's spending watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility, has warned that in the worst-case scenario,unemployment could rise to four million. Danielle Skinner, 23, of Hollinwood, Oldham. was made redundant from her first job at the start of this month. She had been in full-time work since November last year at a digital marketing firm, having been kept on after doing an apprenticeship. Danielle Skinner has applied for more than 50 jobs since being made redundant At first, she was put on furlough. ""But then, as things progressed and businesses started to make people redundant, it did give me an inkling that this was something possibly that was going to happen to me,"" she told the BBC. ""I felt heartbroken personally, because I'd just started to get my career going and I felt like everything was just falling to pieces. Despite her distress, Danielle says she doesn't blame the company: ""The business has to survive and if they didn't take immediate action, then the business could have gone into administration and then there would be no jobs."" She has already applied for 50 or so jobs and has only had one or two responses, which she finds very disheartening. ""It does get me down, I am struggling to find a job, but nevertheless I do try and remain positive and optimistic, thinking, 'I am employable and someone one day will employ me and I'll enjoy the job so much.'"" There's a storm coming: the government's official number-crunchers - the Office for Budget Responsibility - have warned that unemployment could hit four million this year. But the bulk of that is yet to hit the numbers. The normal counts of employment have been propped up by support schemes: more than 11 million private sector workers are still on the government payroll. Those plans have been very effective in staving off a greater crisis as lockdown hit. The looming turmoil and hardship is clear however, with average real pay - that's after inflation - 1.3% lower than a year ago in May and the number of job vacancies at a record low. The number of people counting as self-employed has fallen a record 178,000. As employers now look towards the winding down of support schemes, the announcements of layoffs are now multiplying.Despite the chancellor's new plan, a big rise in joblessness still seems inevitable. The challenge is to getting people back into work - particularly younger ones, the group most likely to have been furloughed. Lengthy unemployment, especially at the start of a career, can blight livelihoods and prospects for decades. And while the economy is opening up, the uncertain outlook may make employers reluctant to do the same with hiring. Business Secretary Alok Sharma said he had ""enormous sympathy"" for people who found themselves out of work. ""I know it's going to be very, very difficult for lots of people as a result of this. The best thing we can do is continue to open up the economy in a phased manner and a cautious manner and get businesses up and running again,"" he told the BBC. He said the cost of inaction would have been ""far greater"" than the action the government had taken. Bridget Phillipson, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said every lost job was ""a personal tragedy now and a hammer blow to public finances in the long run"". She accused the chancellor of taking a ""blanket approach"" rather than targeting the sectors worst affected by the crisis. How have you been affected?

Ailla Barnett put one of her paintings on the gate at her family's allotment. Neighbours were quick to ask for their own slate rainbow to hang and soon she was inundated with requests. Her mother Vicky Barnett says she's so proud of her daughter's achievement, which has raised Â£270.66 for charity. Lancaster Guardian A circus stranded in Morecambe due to the coronavirus lockdown will put on free shows to thank everyone who helped them. Big Kid Circus will perform three times a day next week to say 'thank you' for the help and support they have been given over the last four months. The circus usually travels across the UK and south east Asia, but has been on Morecambe promenade since March after lockdown restrictions meant they were unable to perform. The artists were allowed to stay in Morecambe by Lancaster City Council, which also provided them with electricity, water and refuse collections. They were supported by Morecambe Bay Foodbank. Read the full story in the Lancaster Guardian.,external Increased testing has been introduced in Pendle following a rise in people testing positive for Covid-19. The area in East Lancashire was second highest for new cases in England last week,according to public health stats. ""There is a cause for concern and we need to continue to be careful,"" said David Whipp, council deputy leader. But he said the council was ""not going as far as Blackburn with Darwen"" which hasbrought in extra restrictionsfollowing a spike in infections. A woman who is ""allergic to everything"" says people shielding in the pandemic are still scared to leave home. Natasha Coates, 25, said her life had been ""frozen in time"" after four months indoors but she has no plans to change. ""Those of us shielding are still in the exact same situation we were at the beginning of lockdown,"" she said. Her worries come after charity Scope said 95% of disabled people feel they will still not be safe when shielding advice ends on 1 August. The elite gymnast from Nottingham has mast cell activation syndrome which causes her to havedaily allergic reactions. Restaurant owners have reacted angrily following dozens of ""no-show bookings"" on their first weekend after lockdown. PiÃ±a, an independent Mexican restaurant and bar in Sheffield, opened for the first time to the public on Saturday but had 30 bookings not turn up. Owner Joe Cribley said it was a ""hugely damaging practice"". In Harrogate, Simon Cotton, who runs the Fat Badger, described people as ""thoughtless and selfish"" after they had 15 ""no-shows"" over three days. Pubs, restaurants, hairdressers, libraries and places of worship were all allowed to reopen on 4 July for the first time since 23 March. Their comments echo top chef Tom Kerridge who alsocriticised ""selfish"" and ""disgraceful"" customers,externalwhen 27 people didn't turn up at his Corinthia Hotel restaurant in central London. A series of 50 photographs taken during lockdown by teenagers in Bradford are to be displayed throughout the city. Photographers aged between 13 and 18 documented their experiences for the Through our Lens project. The pictures are to be displayed on billboards, houses, lamp posts and school railings. Carolyn Mendelsohn, who led the project, said ""teenage stories were not being seen"" during lockdown, despite the massive upheavalfor youngsters. The dispersal of 84 residents at an accommodation centre for asylum seekers without being tested for Covid-19 puts lives at risk, campaigners say.

Head teachers in England have hit out at the government for failing to draw up contingency plans for exams in case schools are disrupted beyond September. The Association of School and College Leaders says ministers need to do more than ""tinker at the edges"" if next year's exams are to be fair to pupils. There have been no GCSEs or A-levels this year - with results to be based on estimated grades Exams regulator Ofqual has proposed delaying next year's GCSE and A-level exams from May to early June. But heads have raised concerns of further lockdowns in thewinter months. Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance reporter Lenders are set to reduce the availability of mortgages, loans and other credit in the coming weeks despite greater demand from consumers. Mortgage and loan providers have told the Bank of England that the supply of these products will fall in the summer months owing to coronavirus pressures. It comes as the gradual reopening of the economy and the housing market means people will want to borrow more. One commentator said the credit squeeze was tighter thana decade ago. Daniel WainwrightBBC England Data Unit Local councils in England have been told how much they will get from a third tranche of funding to help them cope with the cost of the pandemic. The Â£500m from the government comes on top of Â£3.2bn already provided, which local authoritieshad warned would not be enough to prevent some of them from running out of money. A further Â£600 million was also given to support social care providers. England's biggest council, Birmingham, gets just under Â£14m, bringing the total it has received from all three tranches to Â£84m. However, the council had forecast a shortfall of about Â£212m over two years. Local Government minister Simon Clarke said: ""Weâve set out a comprehensive package of support for councils, including an unprecedented scheme to reimburse them for loss of income during the pandemic.""  Sam FrancisBBC News, London More than 20,000 people have been caught not wearing face coverings on the Transport for London network by enforcement officers. However, only 61 fixed penalty notices have been issued to those refusing to wear masks since new rules made them mandatory on public transport on 15 June, according to the Mayor of London. Sadiq Khan told the London Assembly that figures showed ""around 90%"" of passengers are wearing face coverings. ""Of the remaining 10% roughly half say they have an exemption,"" Mr Khan said. Anyone travelling on public transport inEngland must wear a face covering. Passengers without a covering are asked to wear one, or will face being refused on board or fined up to Â£100. People with certain health conditions, disabled people and children under the age of 11 are exempt from the rule. A playground will remain closed, despite lockdown rules being relaxed, over fears of a costly insurance payout if a child were to catch coronavirus. Whitmore Parish Council in Staffordshire said it had ""reluctantly"" made the decision after advice from its insurers. Officials said they ""cannot guarantee the safety of users"" but would review the situation next month. Residents said they faced a 30-minute drive to reachalternative facilities. Addressing the small congregation earlier at a memorial service for the victims of coronavirus in Greater Manchester, the Very Reverend Rogers Govender said: ""We are a grieving world, a grieving city.

A prolonged lockdown for the city was announced on 29 June after a spike in Covid-19 cases, with non-essential shops and schools closed. But mayor Sir Peter Soulsby said new data showed only 10% of Leicester had seen higher transmission rates. The health secretary is due to rule on whether to extend restrictions later. The Department of Health and Social Care previously said it ""makes no apology"" for trying to reverse infection rates.

Banks urge 'student loans style' plan to stop job cuts,"UK banks fear up to 800,000 firms employing 3 million could go bust in the next year if they cannot defer repayments on government-backed loans. The lending industry is proposing a student loans-type scheme, where coronavirus loans can be converted into a tax debt repayable over a decade. Like student loans, the money would only be repayable when and if the businesses can afford it. Banks want the scheme to be administered by HM Revenue and Customs. HMRC would have the operational horsepower, existing relationships with, and adequate knowledge of, companies to manage a programme of this scale. Banking industry lobby group TheCityUK is proposing to set up a ""UK Recovery Corporation"", through which companies could convert their short-term debts into a longer term financial obligation to HMRC and  pay back the debt when they are making enough money - a so-called contingent tax obligation. This, the banks argue, would be far simpler and faster to arrange and administer, than the UK government taking direct ownership stakes in hundreds of thousands of companies. Rishi Sunak defends furlough bonus scheme Coronavirus: UK faces 'explosive' debt levels Coronavirus: Chancellor Rishi Sunak unveils Â£30bn plan to save jobs There has been widespread acknowledgement that many firms will struggle to repay the Â£46bn in loans taken out so far, under government schemes designed to help business survive the coronavirus crisis. Government guarantees of between 80-100% are to the lender, not the borrower. This means that the banks may get repaid by the government, but companies in trouble will still be in default and therefore likely to go bust. Put simply, government guarantees to lenders will not save the firms doing the borrowing, or their employees. The appeal to the banking industry is that they will not incur the reputational damage of having to pursue small businesses for repayment for loans that are already largely guaranteed by the government. And the government will not be left with accelerated losses when the banks write off the loan and call in their government guarantees. The banking sector argues that the scheme would be a better alternative to government rescue deals If such a scheme were to be introduced, firms would be able to defer debt interest repayments that start coming due in March 2021, at a time when they will have already faced a backlog of VAT and business rate bills, plus the expiration of the job retention scheme, which has seen the government pay 80% of over 9 million people's wages. In time, say the banks, these IOUs from business could be parcelled up and sold to investors, much like the bundles of student loan debt and bad loans from the financial crisis have been, thus taking it off the government's hands. The government is already on the hook for most of this debt through their coronavirus loan guarantees to the banks. The banks would also relish the opportunity of earning any fees associated with arranging these sales. The Treasury described the proposals as ""a useful contribution to discussions on how businesses can be best supported through this difficult time"". However, on Tuesday, the Chancellor said the bar for government intervention was ""very high"" and should be ""exceptionally rare and only in situations where companies have some strategic value, clearly have a long-term viable future and where the creditors and shareholders have shared in the burden and are not just looking for a free ride on the taxpayer"". The financial services industry counter that this would not amount to a direct ownership stake and that the government has already clearly recognised that a jobs apocalypse is on the horizon. Without a means of converting a short-term debt emergency into a longer-term repayment plan, it will arrive by March next year. These proposals are unlikely to be the final answer. They could be subject to abuse - like any large and fast intervention. For example, there should surely be some strings attached so that firms could not pay their own shareholders fat dividends having parked their debts for the time being. Many will also scoff at the nerve of the banks to try and offload the problem from their balance sheet to the taxpayers after what happened a decade ago. But to be clear, the government has already guaranteed most of these debts. It's already the taxpayer's problem. Sooner or later the government will be left with a massive bill for this crisis. The banks argue that the later the bill comes, the smaller it will be for the taxpayer and the smaller the damage to the social fabric of the UK.

Huge rise in reports of online child abuse images,"Children and adults have been spending much more time online Reports of child abuse images online increased by almost 50% during lockdown, according to the Internet Watch Foundation. In the 11 weeks from 23 March, its hotline logged 44,809 reports of images compared with 29,698 last year. The increase follows months in which both adults and children, many of whom who are working at home, have spent significantly more time online. The government has promised to draw up legislation to reduce online harms. The Internet Watch Foundation (IWF), which is supported by most social media and tech companies, works to remove child abuse material. Chief executive Susie Hargreaves said the hugely increased number of people staying at home had led to increased police estimates of offenders online. ""When you match that with children being online for so much longer during the day, stuck at home, we suddenly have got the conditions for more child sexual abuse images to be generated,"" she said. The fastest growing category of images being removed by the IWF in recent years has been those generated by children after grooming or coercion. Pre-teen girls 'tricked into sex acts on webcams' UK's internet use surges to new highs in lockdown The figures from the IWF are likely to renew the debate about how to keep children safe online, after months of parents grappling to limit the time their children spend online Kelly Anderson has been working to moderate her children's online time Mother of three young children, Kelly Anderson, who started volunteering for the anti-bullying charity, Kidscape, a few months ago in south Wales, says own family have had to work harder at finding a balance with screen time and other activities. Her children have been spending more time online in recent months, to access school work as well as to keep in contact with family and friends. ""It's important for us they still have the opportunity to be children, to go outside and use their bikes, and play with their toys,"" she said. Kelly says that as parents they put boundaries around recreational screen time, allowing it after school work, helping with chores and having family time. She also uses a parenting app to track the content her children are viewing online each day. It allowed her to see when her seven-year-old son accessed video taken from a game that was rated for 18-year-olds. ""Straight away I was able to ask him why he was looking at it. He said his friends had told him it was really good. ""It opened up age-appropriate conversations about why it was rated 18, and what sanctions there would be if he looked at it again. "" The government has promised to bring forward draft legislation against online harms, but there has been growing concern that it will be delayed by the pandemic. This video can not be played How can children stay safe online? Three young people shared their advice Andy Burrows, head of child safety online at the NSPCC, warned: ""Lockdown has resulted in a perfect storm for online child abuse. ""Harm could have been lessened, if social networks had done a better job of investing in technology, investing in safer design features heading into this crisis. "" NSPCC believes they have not done this because they have not been legally required to do so be a regulator. However, there is no data as yet showing an increased incidence of harm to children online during lockdown. It is not clear, for example, whether images being reported were taken or shared before lockdown, began or during the period in question. ""The fear is we don't really know the full extent of the impact of this crisis until children start to go back to school in September and disclose to teachers""  said Mr Burrows. Dr Victoria Baines is a visiting research fellow at the University of Oxford, who previously worked as an analyst at the UK's Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre. She believes using existing legislation against criminal activity may be more effective. She warns increased concern about risks to children online, and reports of images to hotlines, need to be treated with caution and are not the same as children actually being the victims of such crimes. However, she said: ""Online, we have seen some indications that people with a sexual interest in children are talking about the opportunities in lockdown."" The National Crime Agency said its intelligence suggested increased offending. ""We believe the full scale will only be revealed once children return to schools and have more access to trusted adults,"" a spokesman added.

"'My once-in-lifetime holiday hasn't been refunded'A couple tell of their holiday refund ""panic"" as consumer group Which? calls for action from regulators.","Lynn and Martin Fox are still waiting for a refund Lynn and Martin Fox had remortgaged their home to pay for a holiday of a lifetime with their two children in Florida, only for coronavirus and bad luck to ruin their plans. The couple finished paying for the holiday in January, but Mrs Fox, 42, then lost her cabin crew job at Flybe when the airline collapsed in March. Weeks later, as the virus lockdown took hold, work dried up for her husband, a pipe-fitter. Then the holiday, planned for late April, was cancelled. ""We thought the refund would be money in the bank, but then panic started to set in,"" said Mrs Fox. Can I get travel insurance and what are my travel rights? Coronavirus: Package holiday firms told to sharpen up on refunds Coronavirus: 'First Ryanair agreed to a refund, then it didn't' Their refund of Â£6,700 from Virgin Holidays did not arrive. They had little in income, waited weeks for benefits after making a universal credit application, as well as another wait for a government self-employment support grant to come through. ""If only they [Virgin Holidays] would have been honest with us and communicated with us, we would have been happy. If they put a date on the refund, we could have planned,"" she said. ""But the phone cut off calls and emails were ignored."" Last week, the UK's competition authority wrote a letter to more than 100 holiday companies, telling them to speed up their coronavirus refunds process Consumer association Which? says this is far from a unique case. It has built up a dossier of 14,000 complaints from people struggling to obtain refunds for cancelled flights or holidays. The consumer group said this was just ""a snapshot of the problem"", which it claimed was putting people under ""serious financial and emotional distress"". Virgin Holidays said that Mr and Mrs Fox's refund was in a queue. A company spokeswoman said that it continued to be ""inundated with an unprecedented volume of refund requests"" and had increased capacity to deal with these cases. She said refund payments were being taken in date order and would be processed within ""an absolute maximum of 120 days"", from the date the refund was requested. However, this means that waits for a refund far exceeded the legal deadline of 14 days for package holidays. Refunds for cancelled flights are supposed to come within seven days. When the Virgin Atlantic airline, part of the same stable,finalised a rescue dealin recent days, its chief executive Shai Weiss said: ""Despite the incredible efforts of our teams, through cancelled flights and delayed refunds we have not lived up to the high standards we set ourselves, but we will do everything in our power to earn back their trust."" Those involved in 12,600 cases, involving a range of companies and analysed by Which?, have collectively spent nearly six years trying to chase their refunds. The consumer group said these complainants were Â£5.6m out of pocket, at an average of Â£446 each. If you have a package holiday cancelled by the provider, then a refund should be provided for the whole holiday within 14 days If your flight is cancelled, you are entitled to a full refund to the original form of payment within seven days, although many airlines are struggling to meet that deadline. You can accept, or refuse, vouchers or a rebooking but a voucher will probably be invalid if the airline later goes bust If you decide against going on a future flight, which is not yet cancelled, then there is no right to a refund. Different airlines have different rules over what you can do, but many are waiving any charges for changing to a later flight or having a voucher instead. Your travel insurance is unlikely to cover you Airlines acknowledged there have been delays in refunding customers due to the volume of applications, but insisted they were issuing pay-outs. Which? has passed the complaints to the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), which it urged to take ""urgent enforcement action"". Rory Boland, of Which? Travel, said: ""These latest figures are a damning indictment of the behaviour of many airlines and holiday companies in recent weeks. ""With customers being told to either wait months for theirÂ moneyÂ back or accept a voucher that may prove worthless if a company fails, it should come as a surprise to no one that trust has plummeted so drastically. ""Any further delay risks permanent damage to trust in the travel industry."" The CAA told the BBC that it is now reviewing the refund policies and performance of airlines. ""We value the input we have received directly from consumers, as well as those that were sent to us via consumer organisations,"" said CAA spokesman Andrew McConnell. ""We acknowledge the importance of this and will publish the findings of our review in due course."" Last week, the UK's competition authority wrote a letter to more than 100 holiday companies, telling them tospeed up their coronavirus refunds process. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said that some firms had misled customers about their refund rights. A spokeswoman for Abta, which represents the package holiday sector, said companies were themselves facing delays from airlines in refunding them the flight element of any holiday. They had also mutually agreed with many customers to postpone, rather than cancel, holidays.

âIâve applied for more than 100 jobsâ,"Kayleigh Rennix has applied for more than 100 jobs during lockdown Kayleigh Rennix has never struggled to find work before. The HR manager from Essex was earning close to Â£40,000 working in the education sector before she resigned in early March, fearing her role was at risk. Since then she's applied for dozens of jobs, but has had little interest from employers. ""As my leaving date approached, coronavirus reared its ugly head. I would say I've applied for more than 100 jobs and not had many call-backs,"" she says. Kayleigh had planned to find a new job quickly and restart work in May, after a holiday in Italy. But the coronavirus pandemic put paid to those plans. Now the 34-year-old has found herself relying on benefit payments for the first time in her life, and expects to move back in with her parents when her tenancy expires later in the summer. ""My rent is Â£900 a month and my universal credit is Â£740, so it's been quite stressful. I'm really grateful for relationships with my friends and family. My dad gave me some money for some food. It's been a rollercoaster really."" Kayleigh is among the millions of unemployed people who've found themselves looking for work duringthe UK's worst economic slump on record. Claims for universal credit, the benefit for working-age people,hit a record monthly levelin the early weeks of lockdown. There are fears young people could be the worst hit. Under-30s worst hit by lockdown financial squeeze 'We feel so lost' - Young face job despair Job-hunting tips for graduates, from the Class of 2008 Twenty-one-year-old Kevon McPherson of Hitchin, Hertfordshire has been looking for work since he moved out of his foster home in December. ""I've been applying for absolutely everywhere, from dog-walking jobs to becoming a care support worker looking after the elderly,"" he says. Jobcentre staff directed Kevon to a course with youth charity the Prince's Trust, which placed him with his local fire station. Kevon McPherson had plans to become a firefighter With his mind made up that a career in firefighting was for him, Kevon was preparing to take the necessary entrance exams and begin applying for firefighting positions when the Covid-19 outbreak put everything on hold. ""The firefighters were really happy to have me. I beat the instructors at the bleep test [for fitness],"" he says. ""They said, 'Once you've done your firefighting test, come back to us.' But once the coronavirus hit, I was told we'll pick it up later. I'm a bit worried."" Marcin Mazurkiewicz, 32, had just started a new job as a groundskeeper at a holiday park in Argyll in western Scotland when the UK went into lockdown in March. Because he'd only been in the role for one and a half weeks, Marcin's employer wasn't able to put him on furlough, so he went back to stay with family in Poland. He's spent the last month looking for work on UK farms - but found very few jobs. ""In the media, they said there is a massive demand for workers like this, but that doesn't seem to be true anymore,"" he says. ""I found one job for fruit picking one day after it was posted online, and there was information saying they were not taking any more applications because it was filled immediately. Marcin Mazurkiewicz has struggled to find work on a farm Marcin was finally offered a one-month contract tree pruning in Campbeltown, which he plans to accept if he can find suitable accommodation. But he's doubtful about finding long-term work in the UK. ""I'm very worried because my life is more in the UK than Poland. I want to return to education and stay there for good."" Marcin's difficulties finding farm work come as no surprise to Russ Rogers. He started a Facebook group hoping to connect people looking for work with jobs on British farms. He contacted more than 100 farms, but has only managed to provide positions for two of the 1,000 people who have joined his group, called UK Farm Pickers Needed. ""On a daily basis I get 10-15 messages through the group from people asking for work. I have a telephone number on the page so I have text messages day after day from people, and emails, people send me their CVs. ""I've basically had to say many times there just isn't anything at the moment, and that next season starts in July and they need to try then."" While demand for farm workers has slowed, there are some industries that have rapidly ramped up recruitment during the pandemic. Supermarkets have been on a hiring spree, as demand for groceries surged. With her business struggling, Claire Leaman says working at Tesco has paid the bills It's something Claire Leaman, 43, has taken advantage of. Before the coronavirus crisis, Claire ran her own business, offering business development services to property and construction firms. As the UK went into lockdown, her business lost two major clients and Claire panicked. She took a job at Tesco in south Manchester, ensuring there was a safe distance between customers in the aisles. Then the supermarket offered her a job as a picker filling online orders, which have doubled during the pandemic. Claire says the job has paid the bills, but she plans to leave as soon as she can get her business up and running again. ""In this job you're part of everything that's happening with the pandemic. You're a key worker and I suppose that's satisfying,"" she says. ""But it has been a little bit of a worry because you're around a vast amount of people and not everybody understands social distancing, so if I'm going to get the virus, I'm going to get it here, working at Tesco."" Stay open minded- be open to the different types of jobs available. Make your CV work hard for you- keep your CV current and make sure it shows off your strengths. Ask for advice- searching for jobs can be tough at the best of times. If you're feeling overwhelmed, ask for help; whether it's a friend, relative or an expert, talking about how you're feeling can help. Keep your mind active- it's easy to lose focus when you're searching for a job, but there are lots of free courses, articles and resources available online. Get yourself a mentor- getting an online mentor can help you with all things related to your job hunt. A mentor can speak from experience to give advice on your job search, your applications and can give you tips for the perfect interview. Source:The Prince's Trust,external Currently, the industry with the most jobs being advertised is IT, according to the recruitment firm Totaljobs. That's good news for 24-year-old Londoner, Megan Schiviano. At the beginning of June, she was made redundant from her job recruiting sales staff for software firms. Megan Schiviano is confident about finding a new job in software sales But her experience in the tech sector, combined with the recent boom in e-commerce, has put her in a strong position, she says. In just one week she's already had interviews with five different firms. ""There's naturally going to be a lot more candidates than there are jobs, but I know what's asked and how to interview as I've been doing it for the last three years,"" she says. ""I'm quite a positive person. I wouldn't say I'm in a bad situation.""

"UK payrolls shrink by 650,000 jobs in lockdown","The number of workers on UK company payrolls fell by 649,000 between March and June, official figures indicate. The overall jobless rate was unchanged but there are 47,000 more young people unemployed than there were a year ago. Unemployment has not surged, as many feared, because large numbers of firms have put employees on the government-backed furlough scheme. But economists say the full effect on employment will not be felt until the scheme ends in October. The headline unemployment rate hasn't budged since the lockdown was introduced. It stayed at 3.9% between March and May, unchanged on the previous three months. The number of people claiming work-related benefits last month - including the unemployed - is also marginally lower at 2.6 million. Why is the jobless rate not rising? But because of the effect of the furlough scheme on the employment market, analysts say the number of hours worked per week is currently a truer reflection of the impact of the coronavirus crisis. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said that since the start of the pandemic, total weekly hours worked in the UK had fallen by a record 175.3 million, or 16.7%, to 877.1 million hours. ""This was the largest annual decrease since estimates began in 1971, with total hours dropping to its lowest level since May to July 1997,"" the ONS added. The number of Britons on payrolls - which means people employed by a company and does not include the self-employed - fell by 2.2% in June compared with March. Young people are being especially badly hit. ""The estimated number of people unemployed aged 16 to 24 years increased by 47,000 on the year, while other age groups remained steady,"" the ONS said. This video can not be played Four experts offer advice to people looking for a job Many young people are employed in the hospitality industry, which was largely shut down from 23 March. The retail sector, another source of jobs for younger people, has also been hard hit by the lockdown. A fifth of all of those claiming out-of-work benefits, 514,770, are aged between 18 and 24. The number of young new claimants who have signed on between March and June is 276,000 - more than doubling over three months. BBC analysis has found there are now constituencies with nearly 20% of their young population on Universal Credit or Jobseeker's Allowance - including Walton in Liverpool and south Blackpool. Even affluent areas such as south-west Surrey, Henley and Windsor have seen a quadrupling in the number of young claimants under lockdown, though many of these are likely to have become eligible to claim as a result of being furloughed. According to the Resolution Foundation, one-third of 18 to 24-year-old employees have lost jobs or been furloughed during the pandemic, compared to one in six adults above that age. There are not many jobs around for anyone. Vacancies in the UK in April to June 2020 are at the lowest level since the survey began in April to June 2001, at an estimated 333,000. ""This is 23% lower than the previous record low in April to June 2009,"" the ONS said. The ONS added that a larger than usual number of those losing their jobs were not currently searching for another one and were therefore economically inactive rather than unemployed, while some longer-term unemployed people had stopped looking for work. A survey by the British Chambers of Commerce said 29% of businesses expected to cut jobs in the next three months. It called for a reduction in employers' National Insurance contributions to protect businesses and jobs. The government's spending watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility, has warned that in the worst-case scenario,unemployment could rise to four million. Danielle Skinner, 23, of Hollinwood, Oldham. was made redundant from her first job at the start of this month. She had been in full-time work since November last year at a digital marketing firm, having been kept on after doing an apprenticeship. Danielle Skinner has applied for more than 50 jobs since being made redundant At first, she was put on furlough. ""But then, as things progressed and businesses started to make people redundant, it did give me an inkling that this was something possibly that was going to happen to me,"" she told the BBC. ""I felt heartbroken personally, because I'd just started to get my career going and I felt like everything was just falling to pieces. Despite her distress, Danielle says she doesn't blame the company: ""The business has to survive and if they didn't take immediate action, then the business could have gone into administration and then there would be no jobs."" She has already applied for 50 or so jobs and has only had one or two responses, which she finds very disheartening. ""It does get me down, I am struggling to find a job, but nevertheless I do try and remain positive and optimistic, thinking, 'I am employable and someone one day will employ me and I'll enjoy the job so much.'"" There's a storm coming: the government's official number-crunchers - the Office for Budget Responsibility - have warned that unemployment could hit four million this year. But the bulk of that is yet to hit the numbers. The normal counts of employment have been propped up by support schemes: more than 11 million private sector workers are still on the government payroll. Those plans have been very effective in staving off a greater crisis as lockdown hit. The looming turmoil and hardship is clear however, with average real pay - that's after inflation - 1.3% lower than a year ago in May and the number of job vacancies at a record low. The number of people counting as self-employed has fallen a record 178,000. As employers now look towards the winding down of support schemes, the announcements of layoffs are now multiplying.Despite the chancellor's new plan, a big rise in joblessness still seems inevitable. The challenge is to getting people back into work - particularly younger ones, the group most likely to have been furloughed. Lengthy unemployment, especially at the start of a career, can blight livelihoods and prospects for decades. And while the economy is opening up, the uncertain outlook may make employers reluctant to do the same with hiring. Business Secretary Alok Sharma said he had ""enormous sympathy"" for people who found themselves out of work. ""I know it's going to be very, very difficult for lots of people as a result of this. The best thing we can do is continue to open up the economy in a phased manner and a cautious manner and get businesses up and running again,"" he told the BBC. He said the cost of inaction would have been ""far greater"" than the action the government had taken. Bridget Phillipson, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said every lost job was ""a personal tragedy now and a hammer blow to public finances in the long run"". She accused the chancellor of taking a ""blanket approach"" rather than targeting the sectors worst affected by the crisis. How have you been affected?

The looming turmoil and hardship is clear however, with average real pay - that's after inflation - 1.3% lower than a year ago in May and the number of job vacancies at a record low. The number of people counting as self-employed has fallen a record 178,000. As employers now look towards the winding down of support schemes, the announcements of layoffs are now multiplying.Despite the chancellor's new plan, a big rise in joblessness still seems inevitable. The challenge is to getting people back into work - particularly younger ones, the group most likely to have been furloughed. Lengthy unemployment, especially at the start of a career, can blight livelihoods and prospects for decades. And while the economy is opening up, the uncertain outlook may make employers reluctant to do the same with hiring. Business Secretary Alok Sharma said he had ""enormous sympathy"" for people who found themselves out of work. ""I know it's going to be very, very difficult for lots of people as a result of this. The best thing we can do is continue to open up the economy in a phased manner and a cautious manner and get businesses up and running again,"" he told the BBC. He said the cost of inaction would have been ""far greater"" than the action the government had taken. Bridget Phillipson, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said every lost job was ""a personal tragedy now and a hammer blow to public finances in the long run"". She accused the chancellor of taking a ""blanket approach"" rather than targeting the sectors worst affected by the crisis. How have you been affected?

Banks propose 'student loans style' scheme,"UK banks fear up to 800,000 firms employing 3 million could go bust in the next year if they cannot defer repayments on government-backed loans. The lending industry is proposing a student loans-type scheme, where coronavirus loans can be converted into a tax debt repayable over a decade. Like student loans, the money would only be repayable when and if the businesses can afford it. Banks want the scheme to be administered by HM Revenue and Customs. HMRC would have the operational horsepower, existing relationships with, and adequate knowledge of, companies to manage a programme of this scale. Banking industry lobby group TheCityUK is proposing to set up a ""UK Recovery Corporation"", through which companies could convert their short-term debts into a longer term financial obligation to HMRC and  pay back the debt when they are making enough money - a so-called contingent tax obligation. This, the banks argue, would be far simpler and faster to arrange and administer, than the UK government taking direct ownership stakes in hundreds of thousands of companies. Rishi Sunak defends furlough bonus scheme Coronavirus: UK faces 'explosive' debt levels Coronavirus: Chancellor Rishi Sunak unveils Â£30bn plan to save jobs There has been widespread acknowledgement that many firms will struggle to repay the Â£46bn in loans taken out so far, under government schemes designed to help business survive the coronavirus crisis. Government guarantees of between 80-100% are to the lender, not the borrower. This means that the banks may get repaid by the government, but companies in trouble will still be in default and therefore likely to go bust. Put simply, government guarantees to lenders will not save the firms doing the borrowing, or their employees. The appeal to the banking industry is that they will not incur the reputational damage of having to pursue small businesses for repayment for loans that are already largely guaranteed by the government. And the government will not be left with accelerated losses when the banks write off the loan and call in their government guarantees. The banking sector argues that the scheme would be a better alternative to government rescue deals If such a scheme were to be introduced, firms would be able to defer debt interest repayments that start coming due in March 2021, at a time when they will have already faced a backlog of VAT and business rate bills, plus the expiration of the job retention scheme, which has seen the government pay 80% of over 9 million people's wages. In time, say the banks, these IOUs from business could be parcelled up and sold to investors, much like the bundles of student loan debt and bad loans from the financial crisis have been, thus taking it off the government's hands. The government is already on the hook for most of this debt through their coronavirus loan guarantees to the banks. The banks would also relish the opportunity of earning any fees associated with arranging these sales. The Treasury described the proposals as ""a useful contribution to discussions on how businesses can be best supported through this difficult time"". However, on Tuesday, the Chancellor said the bar for government intervention was ""very high"" and should be ""exceptionally rare and only in situations where companies have some strategic value, clearly have a long-term viable future and where the creditors and shareholders have shared in the burden and are not just looking for a free ride on the taxpayer"". The financial services industry counter that this would not amount to a direct ownership stake and that the government has already clearly recognised that a jobs apocalypse is on the horizon. Without a means of converting a short-term debt emergency into a longer-term repayment plan, it will arrive by March next year. These proposals are unlikely to be the final answer. They could be subject to abuse - like any large and fast intervention. For example, there should surely be some strings attached so that firms could not pay their own shareholders fat dividends having parked their debts for the time being. Many will also scoff at the nerve of the banks to try and offload the problem from their balance sheet to the taxpayers after what happened a decade ago. But to be clear, the government has already guaranteed most of these debts. It's already the taxpayer's problem. Sooner or later the government will be left with a massive bill for this crisis. The banks argue that the later the bill comes, the smaller it will be for the taxpayer and the smaller the damage to the social fabric of the UK.

"'My once-in-lifetime holiday hasn't been refunded'A couple tell of their holiday refund ""panic"" as consumer group Which? calls for action from regulators.Business","Lynn and Martin Fox are still waiting for a refund Lynn and Martin Fox had remortgaged their home to pay for a holiday of a lifetime with their two children in Florida, only for coronavirus and bad luck to ruin their plans. The couple finished paying for the holiday in January, but Mrs Fox, 42, then lost her cabin crew job at Flybe when the airline collapsed in March. Weeks later, as the virus lockdown took hold, work dried up for her husband, a pipe-fitter. Then the holiday, planned for late April, was cancelled. ""We thought the refund would be money in the bank, but then panic started to set in,"" said Mrs Fox. Can I get travel insurance and what are my travel rights? Coronavirus: Package holiday firms told to sharpen up on refunds Coronavirus: 'First Ryanair agreed to a refund, then it didn't' Their refund of Â£6,700 from Virgin Holidays did not arrive. They had little in income, waited weeks for benefits after making a universal credit application, as well as another wait for a government self-employment support grant to come through. ""If only they [Virgin Holidays] would have been honest with us and communicated with us, we would have been happy. If they put a date on the refund, we could have planned,"" she said. ""But the phone cut off calls and emails were ignored."" Last week, the UK's competition authority wrote a letter to more than 100 holiday companies, telling them to speed up their coronavirus refunds process Consumer association Which? says this is far from a unique case. It has built up a dossier of 14,000 complaints from people struggling to obtain refunds for cancelled flights or holidays. The consumer group said this was just ""a snapshot of the problem"", which it claimed was putting people under ""serious financial and emotional distress"". Virgin Holidays said that Mr and Mrs Fox's refund was in a queue. A company spokeswoman said that it continued to be ""inundated with an unprecedented volume of refund requests"" and had increased capacity to deal with these cases. She said refund payments were being taken in date order and would be processed within ""an absolute maximum of 120 days"", from the date the refund was requested. However, this means that waits for a refund far exceeded the legal deadline of 14 days for package holidays. Refunds for cancelled flights are supposed to come within seven days. When the Virgin Atlantic airline, part of the same stable,finalised a rescue dealin recent days, its chief executive Shai Weiss said: ""Despite the incredible efforts of our teams, through cancelled flights and delayed refunds we have not lived up to the high standards we set ourselves, but we will do everything in our power to earn back their trust."" Those involved in 12,600 cases, involving a range of companies and analysed by Which?, have collectively spent nearly six years trying to chase their refunds. The consumer group said these complainants were Â£5.6m out of pocket, at an average of Â£446 each. If you have a package holiday cancelled by the provider, then a refund should be provided for the whole holiday within 14 days If your flight is cancelled, you are entitled to a full refund to the original form of payment within seven days, although many airlines are struggling to meet that deadline. You can accept, or refuse, vouchers or a rebooking but a voucher will probably be invalid if the airline later goes bust If you decide against going on a future flight, which is not yet cancelled, then there is no right to a refund. Different airlines have different rules over what you can do, but many are waiving any charges for changing to a later flight or having a voucher instead. Your travel insurance is unlikely to cover you Airlines acknowledged there have been delays in refunding customers due to the volume of applications, but insisted they were issuing pay-outs. Which? has passed the complaints to the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), which it urged to take ""urgent enforcement action"". Rory Boland, of Which? Travel, said: ""These latest figures are a damning indictment of the behaviour of many airlines and holiday companies in recent weeks. ""With customers being told to either wait months for theirÂ moneyÂ back or accept a voucher that may prove worthless if a company fails, it should come as a surprise to no one that trust has plummeted so drastically. ""Any further delay risks permanent damage to trust in the travel industry."" The CAA told the BBC that it is now reviewing the refund policies and performance of airlines. ""We value the input we have received directly from consumers, as well as those that were sent to us via consumer organisations,"" said CAA spokesman Andrew McConnell. ""We acknowledge the importance of this and will publish the findings of our review in due course."" Last week, the UK's competition authority wrote a letter to more than 100 holiday companies, telling them tospeed up their coronavirus refunds process. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said that some firms had misled customers about their refund rights. A spokeswoman for Abta, which represents the package holiday sector, said companies were themselves facing delays from airlines in refunding them the flight element of any holiday. They had also mutually agreed with many customers to postpone, rather than cancel, holidays.

Huge rise in reports of online child abuse imagesNew figures show reports of child abuse images online increased by 50% during lockdown.,"Children and adults have been spending much more time online Reports of child abuse images online increased by almost 50% during lockdown, according to the Internet Watch Foundation. In the 11 weeks from 23 March, its hotline logged 44,809 reports of images compared with 29,698 last year. The increase follows months in which both adults and children, many of whom who are working at home, have spent significantly more time online. The government has promised to draw up legislation to reduce online harms. The Internet Watch Foundation (IWF), which is supported by most social media and tech companies, works to remove child abuse material. Chief executive Susie Hargreaves said the hugely increased number of people staying at home had led to increased police estimates of offenders online. ""When you match that with children being online for so much longer during the day, stuck at home, we suddenly have got the conditions for more child sexual abuse images to be generated,"" she said. The fastest growing category of images being removed by the IWF in recent years has been those generated by children after grooming or coercion. Pre-teen girls 'tricked into sex acts on webcams' UK's internet use surges to new highs in lockdown The figures from the IWF are likely to renew the debate about how to keep children safe online, after months of parents grappling to limit the time their children spend online Kelly Anderson has been working to moderate her children's online time Mother of three young children, Kelly Anderson, who started volunteering for the anti-bullying charity, Kidscape, a few months ago in south Wales, says own family have had to work harder at finding a balance with screen time and other activities. Her children have been spending more time online in recent months, to access school work as well as to keep in contact with family and friends. ""It's important for us they still have the opportunity to be children, to go outside and use their bikes, and play with their toys,"" she said. Kelly says that as parents they put boundaries around recreational screen time, allowing it after school work, helping with chores and having family time. She also uses a parenting app to track the content her children are viewing online each day. It allowed her to see when her seven-year-old son accessed video taken from a game that was rated for 18-year-olds. ""Straight away I was able to ask him why he was looking at it. He said his friends had told him it was really good. ""It opened up age-appropriate conversations about why it was rated 18, and what sanctions there would be if he looked at it again. "" The government has promised to bring forward draft legislation against online harms, but there has been growing concern that it will be delayed by the pandemic. This video can not be played How can children stay safe online? Three young people shared their advice Andy Burrows, head of child safety online at the NSPCC, warned: ""Lockdown has resulted in a perfect storm for online child abuse. ""Harm could have been lessened, if social networks had done a better job of investing in technology, investing in safer design features heading into this crisis. "" NSPCC believes they have not done this because they have not been legally required to do so be a regulator. However, there is no data as yet showing an increased incidence of harm to children online during lockdown. It is not clear, for example, whether images being reported were taken or shared before lockdown, began or during the period in question. ""The fear is we don't really know the full extent of the impact of this crisis until children start to go back to school in September and disclose to teachers""  said Mr Burrows. Dr Victoria Baines is a visiting research fellow at the University of Oxford, who previously worked as an analyst at the UK's Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre. She believes using existing legislation against criminal activity may be more effective. She warns increased concern about risks to children online, and reports of images to hotlines, need to be treated with caution and are not the same as children actually being the victims of such crimes. However, she said: ""Online, we have seen some indications that people with a sexual interest in children are talking about the opportunities in lockdown."" The National Crime Agency said its intelligence suggested increased offending. ""We believe the full scale will only be revealed once children return to schools and have more access to trusted adults,"" a spokesman added.

LiveLiveCoronavirus in Scotland - Farm workers quarantined2 minutes ago2 minutes ago Here's a reminder of yesterday's headlinesHere's a reminder of yesterday's headlines8 minutes ago Good morningGood morningLive Coronavirus in Scotland - Farm workers quarantined  2 minutes ago,"Pupils will not have to physically distance when schools return in August, but teachers will, new advice to the government has suggested One person who tested positive for coronavirus died within the last 24 hours - this is the first fatality, under that measure, for eight days The prevalence of the virus in Scotland remains low says First Minister Nicola Sturgeon The R-number - which suggests the rate at which one person can infect others - is below one The percentage of people in Scotland who have been exposed to coronavirus is likely to be less than 5% Based on random testing of blood samples between the end of April and the end of June this year it was revealed that 4.3% had antibodies The rules around those who are shielding will change from tomorrow with more freedoms allowed, including holidaying away from home Unemployment in Scotland rose between March and May as the impact of lockdown was felt BBC Scotland News That's all from us here on BBC Scotland's live page, on Thursday 16 July 2020. Here's a reminder of today's headlines: Teachers may not have to wear face coverings if they can keep 2m away from pupils and other staff  Finally, the first minister confirmed she was to scale back the daily coronavirus briefings to three days a week over the next fortnight. So we'll be back on Tuesday with our live page. Until then, take care and stay safe. Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland No assembly, no school shows or choirs, no large groups and no parents in school buildings. That's the future envisaged when pupils return on 11 August, according to one Edinburgh headmaster. But Rod Grant, of Clifton Hall
School, believes schools are ready for a return without social distancing, as now envisaged by the Scottish government, because they had already prepared for a more strict regime. He admits that it is difficult to predict what the requirements might be as the science changes ahead of 11 August but tells BBC Radio Scotland: ""I would like to see it as it was before, but obviously with some
increased hygiene practices in place and some strict adherence to rules over
illness."" Scottish schools had initially been preparing for a combination of home and school learning and Mr Grant adds: ""I am more concerned about what education might look like if there is a second wave of the virus in the autumn. Going back to blended learning would be horrific as I don't think kids are enjoying that."" Five things you need to know about the coronavirus outbreak this Thursday evening. Also announced today was a childminding workforce support fund of Â£11.2m to help childminders experiencing financial problems because of coronavirus. Deputy First Minister John Swinney told this lunchtime's briefing that, if the virus continues to be suppressed, he would expect the ""bubbles model"" restricting children to small groups will not be needed - nor will a ban on blending, which would allow parents to then use more than one childcare setting. Graeme McAllister, the chief executive of the Scottish Childminding Association, welcomes the announcement in principle. ""We've been moving further and further away from the small group model...and, when schools reopen, its going to be on the large group model,"" he says. ""And what we were really looking for and were arguing for was parity for childminding."" He says parents and childminders need the restrictions to be lifted fully, not just eased, adding that childminders and other key workers must be able to pick up children from both nurseries and schools. ""If that's not allowed, it will become meaningless,"" he adds. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Larry Flannagan, general secretary of Scotland's biggest teaching union, the EIS, told Lunchtime Live earlier that there is some apprehension among his members about the government's announcement that there is unlikely to be physical distancing in schools when pupils return in August. Jane Peckham, of the NASUWT teaching union, agrees and suggests this ""level of anxiety has to be recognised"" and suggests concerns are mainly about ""the logistics"" involved. ""The lack of physical distancing for young people relies very heavily on all the hygiene measures being in place,"" she points out. ""But, in reality, if you have 500 young people and staff who have to wash their hands or sanitise on entering the building or every time they change a location, that's a massive logistical exercise."" Ms Peckham also highlights the fact that it is suggested ""anyone who wishes to wear a face covering should be able to do so"" and thinks that see-through visors should be considered. Pupils will not have to physically distance when Scotland's schools return in August, but teachers will, new advice to the government has suggested. Ministers have set a target for schools toreopen in full from 11 August. A new report from advisers said ""no distancing"" should be required between pupils in primary or secondary schools. But it said staff should stay 2m (6ft 6in) apart from each other, and put on face coverings when coming into closer contact with children. Read more here. Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland From tomorrow, people who are shielding in Scotland are to be allowed to stay in holiday accommodation and visit outdoor markets, ina change to advice. Couples who do not live together can also meet up without distancing, while the first minister said the need for shielding could be paused entirely at the end of this month. Holly McCormack who has severe asthma, lives alone and has been shielding for the
duration of lockdown. ""The biggest change for me has been forming an extended household group and being able to hug my niece,"" she tells BBC Radio Scotland. ""Having that physical contact makes up for everything else."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Unemployment in Scotland rose between March and May One
man who knows all too well about the struggles of young people out of work is Graeme Armstrong from Lanarkshire. He has turned his life around after years of being
involved in gang culture and drugs and has written a book about his experiences
to prevent other young men going down the same destructive path. ""All the social issues we see come from a lethal absence of hope,"" he tells BBC Radio Scotland. ""If you are a young man or woman in our deprived communities, you leave school with no job to go to. We're fantastic at telling young people what not to do, but we never tell them what to do."" Mr Armstrong would like to see more emphasis on vocational training in schools. ""Life skills are as important as academic skills,"" he says. Unemployment in Scotland rose between March and May as the impact of lockdown was felt,official figures indicate,external. Scotland's unemployment rate rose to 4.3% in the period, a 0.6% increase on the previous quarter. This was higher than theUK unemployment rate of 3.9%. The number of unemployed Scots was up by 15,000 to 120,000. About 28,000 left jobs but were not looking for new work. However, the figures were not as high as many feared due to the number of people on furlough. Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Education Secretary John Swinney Pupils will not have to physically distance when Scotland's schools return in August, but teachers will, new advice to the government has suggested. The Scottish government's revised plan for a return to school has left Anne, who is part of a shielding household with two teenage children, confused and concerned. She claims on BBC Radio Scotland that Education Secretary John Swinney appeared to contradict himself after first saying that all children would no longer need to physically distance. He pointed out that detailed plans were yet to be drawn up, but Anne says of his answers to journalists: ""He specifically said that fourth, fifth and sixth years were termed as young adults and in a greater risk category than other pupils. He then went on to talk about online learning and the possibility of that being used in the autumn."" Anne, who lives in Aberdeenshire, points out that her fourth and fifth year children previously travelled to school in a 16-seater mini-bus - a journey of an hour each way. ""You have exposure of your child to other people from 15 other households,"" he adds. ""We are a shielded household and the shielded person is being exposed to all those risks.""

An appeal to help the world's most vulnerable through the coronavirus pandemic was launched by the UK's Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC) earlier this week. Fourteen charities - including Oxfam, Christian Aid, Islamic Relief and the British Red Cross - will join together to ask the British public to donate. The UK government will double the first Â£5m of donations. Much of the money will go to refugee camps, where overcrowding and poor sanitation allows the virus to spread. DEC's website,externalprovides more details of its coronavirus appeal and its other current appeals. The low level of exposure to coronavirus in the population highlights the care needed in easing lockdown, it has been warned. Economy Secretary Fiona Hyslop says the Scottish government will provide an additional Â£100m
for employment support and training. Ms Hyslop revealed at least Â£50m of that funding will be set aside to help young people get into work. Today's job figures showed the number ofunemployed Scots was up by 15,000 to 120,000. About 28,000 left jobs but were not looking for new work. The measures announced by the Scottish government include a job guarantee for young people, a new national retraining scheme, and
more funding to provide immediate assistance and advice if people are made
redundant. In addition, Fair
Start Scotland, the government's employment support service, has been extended by a further
two years to March 2023. Ms Hyslop has also asked Sandy Begbie to develop an implementation plan for a
job guarantee for young people, as recommended by the Advisory Group on
Economic Recovery. The government will set out more detail on that plan in early
August. Citizens Advice Scotland has said inquiries about redundancy have risen steeply since lockdown was imposed and nearly 750,000 Scots were put on furlough. Advice was given on more than 500 occasions in April, nearly 700 times in May and it was given to more than 1,400 people in June, with the July rate running at a higher level still. Meanwhile, the number of Scots claiming benefits linked to unemployment has more than doubled since March, according to the latest figures from the office for National Statistics, although they are described as 'experimental'. Including those on Jobseekers Allowance, and some of those claiming Universal Credit while seeking work, the number rose from 111,000 in March, to 215,000 last month. There was only a small rise between May and June.  Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Black couple's quizzing by police to be probed,"Police spoke to Ingrid Antoine-Onikoyi and her husband Falil in June A complaint against police officers who accused a black woman of ""jumping on the bandwagon"" is to be probed by a watchdog. Two officers asked Ingrid Antoine-Onikoyi and her husband Falil for their details after they parked cars in Ipswich, saying ""because we can"". The couple's daughter Maja Antoine welcomed the investigation. Suffolk Police said it had referred the complaint to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC). The couple, who are from Watford, were confronted by police outside a relative's house in Ipswich. The incident was filmed on Mrs Antoine-Onikoyi's phone and the footage has been viewed on Twitter more than two million times after it was shared by their daughter. Ms Antoine said in her tweet: ""It's suspicious to walk from your car to your house, while black. The UK is not innocent."" This video can not be played Suffolk Police officers ask for the black couple's details ""because we can"" Speaking to the BBC after receiving news of the IOPC investigation, Ms Antoine said: ""I am pleased, as long as it is properly investigated. What we need is a proper apology."" After the incident Suffolk Police said it was due to give a formal apology to the couple. When the BBC submitted a Freedom of Information request to discover what action had been taken the police said: ""The Joint Norfolk and Suffolk Professional Standards Department have recorded a complaint and referred the matter to the IOPC who are conducting an investigation."" Maja Antoine said she was pleased the IOPC was investigating the incident A Suffolk Police spokesman said the case was ""voluntarily referred to the IOPC"" which would ""conduct an independent investigation into the complaint and therefore it would not be appropriate for the force to comment further at this time"". The IOPC confirmed it had started an investigation. The couple had just parked their cars on a residential street when a police car ""blocked them in"". Mrs Antoine-Onikoyi said: ""They started questioning my husband, asking who he was, were our cars ours, and asking to see his driving licence.""

Imposing trade rules 'deeply damaging to Wales'The Welsh Government says UK ministers must get four-nation consent for post-Brexit arrangements.Wales politics,"The Welsh and UK governments have clashed in a new row over how trade rules will operate post-Brexit. UK government plans ask all four nations to acceptÂ rules and standardsÂ set by each other to ensure trade remains seamless across the UK. The Welsh Government said it had not seen the plans and any system forced on Wales would be ""deeply damaging"". UK Business Secretary Alok Sharma said the plans continued ""hundreds of years"" of a ""seamless internal UK market"". The Welsh Government negotiated an agreement with the UK government in 2018 that means powers in areas such as food labelling, support for farmers and energy efficiency - currently regulated at EU level - will return to Cardiff. The UK government has however said that devolved administrations will have to recognise the rules of all four nations, so as not to harm trade within the UK. In a policy paper, it says this will ensure a level playing field for all firms regardless of which UK nation they are in, to ensure a UK-wide ""internal market"". Mr Sharma told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast with Claire Summers: ""What we are proposing today in the white paper is a continuation of what's happened over hundreds of years which is a seamless UK internal market."" He said the devolved administrations ""have known the direction of travel"" and the UK government would be ""engaging with colleagues extensively across all the devolved administrations and getting their views."" He added: ""The UK has some of the highest standards when it comes to the environment, animal welfare, food safety, and that is not going to change."" The Welsh Government said while it supported the principle of seamless trade any rules must be agreed by the devolved nations. A spokesman said: ""Any new system must have independent oversight and dispute resolution. ""Unfortunately, the UK government has not managed to share the paper with us, and Welsh ministers have had no recent discussions with the UK government on these issues. ""Any attempt to unilaterally impose a system will be deeply damaging."" Covid-19 and Brexit talks 'a nightmare' Post-Brexit immigration plan 'doesn't work for Wales' But Welsh Secretary Simon Hart said Wales was a ""vital part"" of the UK's single marketplace and 75% of Welsh goods were consumed in the rest of the UK. ""Securing this internal market will ensure this trade remains seamless, safeguarding thousands of Welsh jobs,"" he said. ""It is vital for our shared prosperity and our ability to bounce back from the pandemic that people, products, ideas and investment continue to flow unhindered throughout the UK."" During a Commons statement on the legislation, Plaid Cymru MP Hywel Williams called it a ""power-grab"" transferring ""vast powers over devolved areas to Tory ministers"". ""Thirty-five years ago, in 1985, the then Tory European Commissioner's white paper detailed 300 legislative proposals to complete the European Single Market and that with a seven-year deadline,"" he said. ""On the 'UK Internal Market', this Tory government is giving a four-week consultation over the summer. ""Persuasive evidence, were it needed, that the UK internal market is first and foremost a convenient headline - a veneer lacking detail or a legal basis."" After Welsh ministers had complained about a lack of consultation and not seeing the proposals before they were made public, it emerged that the Welsh Government had cancelled a meeting that would have given the first minister a briefing on the plans. A spokesperson for the Welsh Government said: ""Given the significance of the changes the UK government is planning to impose on Wales, we asked for a copy of the paper ahead of any meeting with the secretary of state for Wales. ""This would have allowed for a more meaningful discussion on these deeply damaging changes. ""Regrettably, this did not happen."" This is really all about who gets to decide things such as food standards after EU rules stop applying at the end of the year. Ministers in Cardiff Bay are concerned about a hollowing out of devolution by the back door. Take the proposal for a "" mutual recognition principle"" as an example -.. they say it effectively means the lowest common denominator wins because every UK home nation has to recognise every other home nation's standards. So in the trade negotiations with the US - the proverbial chlorinated chicken issue - if  the UK government negotiated a trade deal with the US allowing lower standard food into England, the Welsh Government couldn't stop it coming into Wales. But the UK government insist they will protect British food and farming standards in the negotiations so the issue won't arise.

Black Lives Matter protester statue being removedWorkers start taking down the statue of Jen Reid from the plinth where Edward Colston's once stood.Bristol,"This video can not be played The sculpture was removed on Thursday, having been in place for just over 24 hours A sculpture of a Black Lives Matter protester has been removed from the plinth where a statue of slave trader Edward Colston once stood. The sculpture of Jen Reid was erected on Wednesday but removed by Bristol City Council just over 24 hours later. Ms Reid had been photographed standing on the empty plinth afterthe Colston statue was pulled downduring protests. Mayor Marvin Rees said it was up to the people of Bristol to decide what would replace Colston's statue. Bristol City Council contractors removed the sculpture of Ms Reid and took it away in the back of a lorry by 05:30 BST on Thursday. Jen Reid posed with her statue, which appeared on the empty plinth on Wednesday The black resin statue of Ms Reid, called A Surge of Power, was created by artist Marc Quinn and designed to be a temporary installation to continue the conversation about racism. He said he was inspired to create it after seeing an image of her standing on the plinth with her fist raised during the Black Lives Matter protest on 7 June. How many statues of black people does the UK have? Mayor receives racist letters after statue toppled Photographer records reactions to Colston fall Mr Quinn then contacted Ms Reid through social media and they worked together on the statue, which was erected shortly before 04:30 on Wednesday. Ms Reid said she had felt an ""overwhelming impulse"" to climb on to the plinth during last month's protest, and the sculpture ""is about making a stand for my mother, for my daughter, for black people like me"". The sculpture was taken away in a lorry Speaking in a Facebook Q&A, Mr Rees said it was important to gauge people's opinions on a replacement for the Colston statue, but he felt an empty plinth was ""a very powerful statement at this time"". He told BBC Radio 5 live that how race was navigated in the UK was a ""delicate balance"", adding: ""Running around provoking debate without any awareness of the potential consequences of that debate is not OK. ""We have to approach things with wisdom, which is why we've set out a process that revolves around a history commission telling the full story of Bristol so that the city is much more informed and is in a better position to collectively decide who it wants to honour and where."" Bristol City Council said the sculpture of Ms Reid would be held at its museum The mayor previously said the sculpture was ""the work and decision of a London-based artist"" and permission was not requested for it to be installed. The authority tweeted,externalto say the sculpture of Ms Reid would be held at its museum ""for the artist to collect or donate to our collection"". Mr Rees said he would ""really welcome a contribution"" from Mr Quinn as it had cost the authority money to remove the statue. This video can not be played What do we do with the UK's symbols of slavery? Protesters used ropes to pull the Colston statue, which had been at the city centre site since 1895, from its plinth last month. It was then dragged to the harbourside, where it was thrown into the water at Pero's Bridge - named in honour of enslaved man Pero Jones who lived and died in Bristol. The council later retrieved the statue, and said it would be displayed in a museum along with placards from the protest.

"Jobless figures 'not showing full extent of crisis'Unemployment increased by 34,000 in April to reach 1.3 million, according to official data.Business","The way the UK reports unemployment may not reflect the ""true scale of joblessness"", says a think tank. Unemployment rose by 34,000 in April to reach 1.3 million, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). But the Resolution Foundation argues that the 23% drop in average hours worked between early March and late April is a better indicator of unemployment. The ONS said it publishes a large selection of analysis on employment. Official numbers on how many people are out of work and claiming unemployment benefits will be published on Thursday. Chancellor warns of 'tough times' for UK economy Sunak unveils Â£30bn plan to save jobs Virus crisis expected to 'level down' UK economy Resolution Foundation chief economist Mike Brewer said: ""Britain is in the midst of an unprecedented economic shock that is profoundly affecting millions of people's jobs. ""Unemployment is forecast to hit 4 million for the first time ever. And yet our official data is failing to show the true extent of this jobs crisis."" On Tuesday, the government's budgetary watchdog, the Office for Budgetary Responsibility (OBR), projected thatunemployment could reach 4 million,externalpeople, if the UK's economic recovery is poor, up from 1.3 million in 2019in its latest analysis. Meanwhile, data for people claiming benefits soared to 2.3 million for April. But these figures could include some people who are eligible to claim support while still employed. The ONS said: ""Enhancements to Universal Credit, as part of the UK government's response to the coronavirus, mean that an increasing number of people became eligible for unemployment-related benefit support, although still employed."" The Resolution Foundation says this data is not a good reflection of the true picture either because it includes furloughed workers who initially made a claim when the crisis first struck. The think tank says it estimates that ""fewer than half (700,000) of the 1.6 million increase in the claimant count between March and May is related to people who are newly out-of-work, and not receiving furlough pay or self-employed grants from the government"". It urges the ONS to make more of its ability to count the number of workers who are employed and not temporarily without work, alongside the headline employment rate, as this would provide ""a far more accurate picture of labour market activity"". The ONS said it agreed that data on hours worked was an important component in understanding the unemployment picture in the UK. ""However, our detailed Labour Force Survey estimates are based on interviews with tens of thousands of people and provide vital detail not available from any other source,"" it said in a statement. ""It is difficult to interpret claimant count figures, as we know these include some people in work."" ""Measuring the labour market, like many areas of the economy, presents additional challenges at the moment, especially with so many people furloughed. That is why the ONS has introduced new surveys and data sources to provide the best possible indicators of the impact of the pandemic. "" Separately, the British Chambers of Commerce is warning that almost a third of UK businesses (28%) they surveyed expect to cut jobs in the next three months. The figure compares to last year, when only 7% expected to do so. Some 7,400 firms took part in the BCC survey, which found more than a quarter of the firms (28%) said they had already shrunk their workforces since the pandemic began.

UK electrical waste mountain growing,"UK households and businesses produce 1.45 million tonnes of electrical waste each year, research shows. The e-waste research organisation Material Focus calculates that at least 500,000 tonnes of the waste were thrown away, stolen or hoarded. Its latest study suggests un-recycled household electricals cost the UK over Â£370m a year in lost materials like gold, copper, aluminium and steel. This is important because mining the metals leads to pollution. It also harms wildlife and fuels climate change. Material Focushas a postcode locator,externalfor people to find their nearest e-waste recycling point for items such as toasters and old cables. Can we fix our way out of the e-waste problem? The report says many people hang on to old laptops and phones because they hold photos or sensitive data. It suggests one answer is to ask mobile phone shops to transfer data and return old phones to factory settings in front of you. Reputable repair shops could also wipe data for you â at a price. Some charity shops will also take e-waste such as phones. There will be another option from January, when a new rule means youâll be able to hand back to any major shop an aged kettle, say, or toaster when you buy a new one. Some stores offer this already. The increase in electrical waste has been relentless as the population has grown and new consumer electronics reach the market. Many of the new purchases are not replacements for existing kit, but innovative consumer goods that werenât available previously, such as smart speakers. The academic lead for the study was Alison Stowell at Lancaster University. She told BBC News: âThese figures on electrical waste are quite enormous. âWhen we consume things, we donât tend to think about how much material is in them or how valuable they could be if they are put back into the production and supply chain through recycling."" The report says 1.65 million tonnes of electricals were sold in the UK in 2017, with 155,000 tonnes dumped in domestic bins and subsequently incinerated or sent to landfill. Mark Hilton from the consultancy Eunomia told BBC News: âThe UK is still failing to meet its target of collecting 65% of electricals. ""Itâs often too hard for people to get to a recycling centre, many of which are only accessible by car. Weâd like to see small waste electricals collected alongside other recyclables from the doorstep."" He also wants incentives offered such as cash-back or store vouchers for unwanted electrical goods â which could help encourage people back to the high-street. And he says itâs critical for ministers to oblige online platforms, like Amazon, to take far greater end-of-life responsibility for items their sellers put on the market, through perhaps secure deliveries. That issue is now being discussed by the government. A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said: âWe are committed to moving to a more circular economy. âWe will be reviewing the regulations on electrical items to help drive up recycling, encourage better eco-design and ensure manufacturers and retailers take responsibility for waste electricals.â Follow Rogeron Twitter.,external 'Like an atomic bomb': Los Angeles fire chiefs warn death toll is likely to rise What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

"White House attacks 'bizarre' - US disease chiefDr Anthony Fauci says recent efforts by the Trump administration to discredit him are ""nonsense"".US & Canada","Dr Fauci: ""It's only reflecting negatively on them"" US infectious disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci has described recent efforts by the Trump administration to discredit him as ""bizarre"" and ""nonsense"". ""Ultimately, it hurts the president to do that,"" Dr Fauci said in an interview with The Atlantic. ""It doesn't do anything but reflect poorly on them."" On Sunday, a White House official shared a list detailing past apparent erroneous comments by Dr Fauci. But on Wednesday Mr Trump insisted he had a ""good relationship"" with him. ""We're all in the same team including Dr Fauci,"" he said. ""We want to get rid of this mess that China sent us, so everybody's working on the same line and we're doing very well."" Living in Florida and Texas as virus cases surge Why we should all be wearing masks The White House statement attacking Dr Fauci criticised him for what it said was conflicting advice on face coverings and remarks on Covid-19's severity. Responding to the criticism,Dr Fauci told The Atlantic that targeting him was ""completely wrong"",external. ""I cannot figure out in my wildest dreams why they would want to do that,"" he said. ""I think they realise now that that was not a prudent thing to do, because it's only reflecting negatively on them,"" he added. Anthony Fauci isn't angry. He's just... disappointed. The top government expert on infectious diseases took the high road in his first public comments after White House officials, both on and off the record, questioned his professional judgement and handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Dr Fauci acknowledges that the advice and analysis he has provided has shifted over time, but he insists his recommendations have always been based on the latest science. Those views have sometimes led to clashes with the president, who has attempted to shift focus to rebuilding a US economy that has been devastated by the pandemic. Dr Fauci has said that the top priority must be controlling the spread of the virus and recent reopening steps have set those efforts back. Such blunt talk has helped make Dr Fauci a popular figure during the pandemic, and that alone may be behind some of the resentment that is simmering within the White House. The swipes at Dr Fauci, however, seem destined to be counter-productive. With a general election just a few months away the Trump campaign needs a consistent public message - and an administration attacking one of its own, then distancing itself from those attacks, may only promote a message of chaos and confusion. Dr Fauci was also criticised by Peter Navarro, Mr Trump's top trade adviser,in an opinion piece for USA Today,externalin which he said the disease expert had been ""wrong about everything I have interacted with him on"". However, the White Housedistanced itself from Mr Navarro's remarks,external, with communications chief Alyssa Farah tweeting that the article ""didn't go through normal White House clearance processes"" and was ""the opinion of Peter alone"". Asked about Mr Navarro's piece as he departed the White House for Atlanta, Mr Trump said he should not have written it. ""Well he made a statement representing himself. He shouldn't be doing that,"" he said. In his interview with The Atlantic, Dr Fauci said he was not thinking of resigning over the attacks on him. ""I think the problem is too important for me to get into those kinds of thoughts and discussions. I just want to do my job. I'm really good at it. I think I can contribute. And I'm going to keep doing it,"" he said. He has also told Reuters that he believes the US will successfully develop a vaccine against the coronavirus by the end of the year. It follows early stage results from a vaccine developed by the firm Moderna, which Dr Fauci said were promising because the vaccine appeared to offer the type of protection seen in a natural infection. Dr Fauci's comments come after reports that as of 15 July, US hospitals will have to report Covid-19 patient data to the federal health agency in Washington instead of the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). The CDC, the US's top public health institute, has until now been responsible for handling data about the pandemic from its hospital network. Health experts have expressed concerns that data will be politicised, become less transparent and possibly affect the work of researchers and modellers. The US has reported more than 3.4 million cases of coronavirus, and more than 136,000 deaths nationwide, according to Johns Hopkins University.
