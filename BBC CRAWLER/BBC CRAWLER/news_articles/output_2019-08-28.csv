Italy coalition agreed in blow to nationalists,"The PD's Nicola Zingaretti: ""We love Italy and we consider it worthwhile to try this"" The leaders of Italy's centre-left Democratic Party (PD) and populist Five Star Movement have agreed to form a coalition government. ""We consider it worthwhile to try this experience,"" the PD's Nicola Zingaretti said after meeting the president on Wednesday - the deadline for any deal. It was agreed that Giuseppe Conte should stay on as prime minister. The planned joint administration will serve until the next scheduled elections in 2023. On Tuesday, Five Star leader Luigi Di Maio welcomed what he referred to as the PD's willingness to accept Mr Conte's reappointment. The two parties, traditionally staunch rivals, have been holding tense talks following the collapse of the previous coalition government last week. ""In difficult times like these, shunning our responsibility to have the courage to try this is something we cannot afford,"" Mr Zingaretti said. Video: What Italians think of the government crisis President Sergio Mattarella, who met party leaders in Rome to try to chart a way forward, has summoned Mr Conte to a meeting on Thursday morning. He is widely expected to give him a mandate to form a new government. The two parties have been in discussions since Mr Conte resigned as prime minister in dramatic fashion last week. His decision came after Matteo Salvini, the leader of the nationalist League party, tabled a no-confidence motion against him. During his 20 August resignation speech,Mr Conte launched a blistering attack on Mr Salvini, accusing him of being ""irresponsible"". President Sergio Mattarella (L) shakes hands with League party leader Matteo Salvini Mr Salvini's League party had been in power with the anti-establishment Five Star Movement for 14 months when he effectively ended the coalition, saying he could no longer work with his partners. Both Mr Salvini and Forza Italia leader Silvio Berlusconi called for fresh elections after meeting President Mattarella. This coalition agreement represents a major setback for the League's leader Matteo Salvini. For 14 months, he was the dominant figure in Italian politics. But a share of power wasn't enough for him - he wanted outright power. This led him to overreach. Mr Salvini brought down the government last week in the hope of winning a potential snap election. But it turns out that his gamble had a fatal flaw. The League Party's leader did not count on the possibility of his opponents teaming up to stop him. A common aim - Stop Salvini - now binds together the Five Star Movement and the Democratic Party in their new coalition. But in order for this administration to last, the two parties may need to find more common ground than their mutual distrust of a single man. Their coalition will be harried and chased at every step by the man they've sent into sudden opposition. Following weeks of hostility between the two ruling parties, Mr Salvini called for a snap election this month, saying that differences with his Five Star coalition partners could not be mended. A failed attempt by Five Star to scrap plans for a high-speed rail link showed that the coalition could no longer govern, the right wing leader said at the time. However, addressing the Senate last week, Mr Conte said that Mr Salvini had been ""looking for a pretext to return to the polls"" since his party's success in European elections in May. This video can not be played Conte attacks Salvini in resignation speech The League has soared ahead of Five Star in opinion polls, due mainly to Mr Salvini's stance against illegal immigration, but has fallen back slightly since pulling the plug on the coalition. In the May elections, the League came top with 34% of the votes in Italy, whereas Five Star got about 17%. Salvini: Can Italy trust this man? Despite this, Mr Di Maio has said his party does not fear another election.

Climate change: People 'must consume less',"We need to change our behaviours and our lifestyles, says Sir Ian People must use less transport, eat less red meat and buy fewer clothes if the UK is to virtually halt greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, the government's chief environment scientist has warned. Prof Sir Ian Boyd said the public had little idea of the scale of the challenge from the so-calledNet Zero emissions target. However, he said technology would help. The conundrum facing the UK - and elsewhere - was how we shift ourselves away from consuming, he added. In an interview with BBC News, Sir Ian warned that persuasive political leadership was needed to carry the public through the challenge. Asked whether Boris Johnson would deliver that leadership, he declined to comment. Mr Johnson has already been accused by environmentalists of talking up electric cars whilst reputedly planning a cut in driving taxes that would increase emissions and undermine the electric car market. UK commits to 'net zero' emissions by 2050 Government 'like Dad's Army' on climate change Climate change: Where we are in seven charts Sir Ian said polluting activities should incur more tax. He believes the Treasury should reform taxation policy to reward people with low-carbon lifestyles and nudge heavy consumers into more frugal patterns of behaviour. It was vital, he said, for the changes to be fair to all parts of society. He also believes Net Zero won't happen unless the government creates a Net Zero ministry to vet the policies of all government departments in the way the Brexit ministry vets Brexit-related decisions. Emissions won't be reduced to Net Zero while ministers are fixed on economic growth measured by GDP, instead of other measures such as environmental security and a relatively stable climate, he argued. Asked why the UK should take the lead when China's emissions are so high, he answered that the Chinese government was very worried about the climate and was taking it very seriously. Sir Ian has been in his post as the government's chief environment scientist for seven years Sir Ian, a polar expert with a chair in biology at St Andrews University, suggested that the UK was in a good position to show the world how to achieve Net Zero. But he agreed that similar radical action was ultimately needed by all nations. He said that on broader issues the government had produced (or was in the process of producing) impressive strategies on the environment, waste, air pollution, marine and food. Some ministers were enthusiastic to translate these into firm strategies, but they needed support from the public, he said. He confessed that he was not optimistic about the future of the planet because so many systems of government needed to change in a short time. Sir Ian, who leaves Defra on Thursday after seven years in post, said: ""The way we live our lives is generally not good for the environment. ""We like to consume things, but the more we consume the more we absorb the resources of the planet. ""That means we have to grow those resources or we have to mine them - and in doing that we generate waste. And consumption is going up all the time. ""(There's) a conundrum - how do we shift ourselves from consuming? We need to do more about learning to live sustainably. We talk about sustainability but we don't really know what it means. ""We need to make major technological advances in the way we use and reuse materials but we (also) need to reduce demand overall - and that means we need to change our behaviours and change our lifestyles. ""We certainly won't be able to travel so much as we have in the past, so we have to get used to using modern communications methods. ""Moving material round the planet will be more difficult so we'll have to do more with 3D printing; that sort of thing. Greater use is required of new technologies such as 3D printing ""We've got to reduce demand to a much greater extent than we have in the past, and if we don't reduce demand we're not going to reduce emissions. ""Emissions are a symptom of consumption and unless we reduce consumption we'll not reduce emissions. ""It will very rarely come down to a direct message like 'sorry, you can't buy that but you can buy this'. But there will be stronger messages within the (tax) system that make one thing more attractive than the other."" He said UK government strategies were in place on air, environment, resources, waste, marine, and food. ""[Ministers] need to be persuasive."" Asked if he was optimistic about the future of the planet, he said: âWe have the intelligence to do it; we have the potential to develop the technologies to do itâ¦ Iâm doubtful that we have the governance structures to make it happen at the speed it needs to happen at."" Richard Black, from the think tank Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU), said Sir Ian's words were ""somewhat surprising"". He added: ""They appear to contradict the mass of evidence assembled on getting to Net Zero, including the major report from the government's statutory adviser the Committee on Climate Change."" I understand that the Confederation of British Industry, the CBI, accept there will have to be behavioural change to meet Net Zero. A source in the organisation said they were frustrated that government climate policies were currently too weak. Given the very broad nature of Sir Ian's comments, we approached Downing Street for a comment. They declined and passed us back to Sir Ian's department, Defra. But their statement didn't address any of his key questions about governance, leadership and consumption. It said: ""The impact of climate change is clear and demands urgent action from countries around the world. The UK has already shown global leadership by becoming the first major economy to legislate for net zero emissions by 2050 - but we know there is more to do. ""That's why we're reforming farming policy to reward environmental actions, reviewing our food system to ensure it is more sustainable, taking steps to accelerate tree-planting and peatland restoration, and introducing a flagship Environment Bill to address the biggest environmental priorities of our age.""

Advanced ape skull find changes human origin ideas,"The discovered skull (R) with an artist's rendering (L) of what Anamensis might have looked like Researchers have discovered a nearly complete 3.8-million-year-old skull of an early ape-like human ancestor in Ethiopia. An analysis of the new specimen challenges ideas about how the first humans evolved from ape-like ancestors. The current view that an ape named Lucy was amonga species that gave rise to the first early humans,externalmay have to be reconsidered. The discovery is reported in thejournal Nature,external. The skull was found by Prof Yohannes Haile-Selassie at a place called Miro Dora, which is in the Mille District of Ethiopia's Afar Regional State. The scientist, who's affiliated to the Cleveland Museum of Natural History in Ohio, US, said he immediately recognised the significance of the fossil. ""I thought to myself, 'oh my goodness - am I seeing what I think I am seeing?'. And all of a sudden I was jumping up and down and that was when I realised that this was what I had dreamt,"" he told BBC News. Fossil finds extend human story,external 'Lucy's baby' found in Ethiopia,external New human-like species discovered Prof Haile-Selassie says the specimen is the best example yet of the ape-like human ancestor calledAustralopithecus anamensis- the oldest known australopithecine whose kind may have existed as far back as 4.2 million years ago. It had been thought thatA.anamensiswas the direct ancestor of a later, more advanced species calledAustralopithecus afarensis,which in turn has been considered a direct ancestor of the first early humans in the grouping, or genus, known asHomo, and which includes all humans alive today. Different aspects of the new specimen's face and view (bottom-left) looking at its upper-jaw from below. The creature had protruding jaws and small earholes The discovery of the firstafarensisskeleton in 1974 caused a sensation. She was nicknamed Lucy by researchers after the Beatles song, Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds, which was playing at the excavation site. Hailed as ""the first ape to have walked"", Lucy captured the public's attention. But writing a commentary in Nature, Prof Fred Spoor, of London's Natural History Museum, said thatanamensis""looks set to become another celebrated icon of human evolution"". The reason for this likely elevated status is because we can now say thatanamensisandafarensisactually overlapped in time. The former did not evolve directly into the latter in a neat linear manner, as previously supposed. The realisation comes about through the reinterpretation that the new fossil brings to bear on a previously discovered 3.9-million-year-old skull fragment. That fragment had been assigned toanamensis.Scientists can now see it is actually the remains of anafarensis,pushing this species' origin deeper into the past. It's apparent now the two species must have co-existed for at least 100,000 years. What most likely happened was that a small group ofanamensisisolated itself from the main population and over time evolved intoafarensisbecause of adaptations to local conditions. The two types rubbed along for a while before the remnantanamensisdied out. The finding is important because it suggests that additional overlaps with other advanced ape-like species may also have occurred, increasing the number of potential evolutionary routes to the first humans. In short, although this latest discovery does not disprove that Lucy's kind gave rise to theHomogroup, it does bring other recently named species into contention. Prof Haile-Selassie agreed that ""all bets are now off"" as to which species is humanity's direct ancestor. He explained: ""For a long time,afarensiswas considered the best candidate as an ancestor to our kind, but we are not in that position any more. Now we can look back at all the species that might have existed at the time and examine which one may have been most like the first human."" The remains of an ape named Lucy thought to be the ancestor of the first humans The term ""missing link"" drives anthropologists crazy when they hear anyone, especially journalists, use it to describe a fossil that is part-ape and part-human. Indeed Dr Henry Gee, a senior editor at Nature, once threatened to ""rip my liver out and eat it with onions, borlotti beans and a glass of claret"" if I did so when reporting a previous discovery. There are many reasons for Henry's irritation, but chief among them is the recognition that there are many links in the chain of human evolution and most if not nearly all of them are still missing. Anamensisis the latest in a string of recent discoveries that shows that there was no smooth line of ascent to modern humans. The truth is far more complex and far more interesting. It tells a story of evolution ""trying out"" different ""prototype"" human ancestors in different places until some of them were resilient and clever enough to withstand the pressures wrought by changes in climate, habitat and food scarcity - and evolve into us. Prof Haile-Selassie is one of the few African scientists working in human evolution. He is now a recognised name but he says it's hard for well qualified African researchers to get the necessary financial backing from Western-based research funding organisations. ""Most of the fossil evidence related to our origin comes from Africa and I think Africans should be able to use the resources available in their own continent and advance their career in palaeoanthropology. Their limitations getting to this field of study is usually funding,"" he told me.

Bolton saved as takeover completedBolton Wanderers' survival is secured as Football Ventures (Whites) Limited completes its takeover of the club.BBC Sport,"Bolton Wanderers began the season with a 12-point deduction after going into administration in May Bolton Wanderers' survival has been secured after Football Ventures (Whites) Limited completed its protracted takeover of the club. Administrators had warned the club could be placed into liquidation on Wednesday without a finalised takeover. It looked to have collapsed on Monday, leading to bleak warnings about the future of the 145-year-old club. ""I'm delighted we've finally reached a satisfactory conclusion with the sale,"" said joint administrator Paul Appleton. ""I have every sympathy for the staff, players and fans who have been forced to stand by while their club was taken to the brink. I am delighted their loyalty, dedication and patience has finally been rewarded."" On Tuesday, the English Football League gave Bolton 14 days to complete a deal or face expulsion from the competition. That came as Bury became thefirst club to be expelledfrom the league for 27 years after a takeover bid fell through just before the EFL's deadline. ""At times it has been difficult to keep our counsel but we took a decision to remain on the sidelines even when further damage was being inflicted by delays outside of our control,"" said a statement on behalf of Football Ventures. ""Now we are excited to begin restoring this magnificent football club to its rightful position, securing its future for the fans, the loyal club staff, and the players."" As a result of the takeover, Bolton are now out of administration, with their place in the EFL no longer under threat. ""These past few months have undoubtedly been challenging and, at times, fraught - never more so in the past few days - and I would like to thank all parties for their efforts in achieving the desired outcome,"" said EFL executive chair Debbie Jevans. Could the German model help prevent another Bury/Bolton situation? Appleton praised one of the main creditors, the Eddie Davies Trust, for being ""willing to find a compromise to save the club"" during the talks - but he was critical of the club's former owner Ken Anderson, who he said was responsible for the deal initially collapsing on Monday. He added the Trust was determined ""not to allow Bolton Wanderers to suffer any longer at the hands of Ken Anderson"". ""Sadly, Mr Anderson has used his position as a secured creditor to hamper and frustrate any deal that did not benefit him or suit his purposes,"" he added. ""Thankfully, with the assistance of the Trust and others, we were able to overcome this obstacle."" Bolton, who started the season with a 12-point deduction,called off last week's gameagainst Doncaster Rovers amid welfare concerns for younger players, whilePhil Parkinson also resignedas manager. ""At times, some of the hurdles appeared insurmountable and the frustration felt has been immense, not least by the supporters who have had to endure too many weeks of uncertainty,"" added Appleton. ""Now there can be a fresh start with owners who, I believe, will run the club for the good of the supporters and the community as a whole."" BBC Radio Manchester has attempted to contact Anderson for comment. Fans waited anxiously outside Bolton's stadium on Tuesday before the EFL's 17:00 BST deadline Football Ventures (Whites) Limited, led by Sharon Brittan, were named as preferred bidders on 1 July by administrators David Rubin & Partners. The takeover has since faced numerous hurdles, with the deal appearing to have collapsed completely on Saturday despite being close to completion the previous day. In a statement issued on Monday, the administrators said if they were unable to resurrect the move, the club was ""not in a position to carry on trading"" and would enter liquidation, leading to the ""inevitable loss of over 150 jobs"". Wanderers were beaten 5-0 at home by Ipswich Town on Saturday in front of just 5,454 fans - the lowest attendance for a league game at the University of Bolton Stadium in its 22-year history. With the majority of the club's senior players having left, they have fielded sides made up almost entirely of youth-team players in their five matches so far this campaign - including their youngest-ever side against Coventry City on 10 August. ""It's just fantastic. I was down at the stadium when the statement came through. It's what everybody has been waiting for,"" said Maggie Tetlow, co-founder of the Bolton Wanderers Supporters' Trust. She told BBC Radio 5 Live the new owners have ""a good track record in business"". Bolton were relegated from the Premier League in 2012. Four years later their football existence was threatened as former striker Dean Holdsworth was part of a takeover at the club. Anderson took control after Holdsworth's company Sports Shield was wound up. Wanderers entered administration in May after being relegated from the Championship, before Football Ventures agreed a deal to take over the club. The deal was almost stopped after Laurence Bassini, who had bid to buy the club before administration, was awarded a court order blocking the sale on 8 August. The court order was adjourned, paving the way for the takeover to continue before it eventually collapsed. The club called off their match against Doncaster last week citing welfare concerns, having only five senior outfield players available. Boss Phil Parkinson resigned last Thursday after three years with the club and a young side lost 5-0 against Ipswich on Saturday. Football Ventures eventually complete their takeover with the threat of liquidation and expulsion from the EFL looming.

High Street shops sold knives to children,"High Street retailers have illegally sold knives to children during test purchases conducted by National Trading Standards, the organisation says. Tesco, Asda, Poundland and Home Bargains sold blades to under-18s at least 15 times each during tests between April 2018 and March 2019. Tesco and Asda have since updated their checks and further restricted sales. Poundland said it stopped selling kitchen knives last year, while Home Bargains has not yet commented. Trading Standards sent in ""mystery shoppers"" under the age of 18 to carry out the test purchases. Shop staff failed to prevent the sale of a knife to a child 344 times, equal to 15% of the 2,231 tests carried out by Trading Standards at national chain and independent shops. Knives and alcohol sold to children Major stores caught selling knives to teen Knife crime at record levels in 2018 The key facts about rising knife crime It is illegal to sell knives to those under 18,unless it has a folding blade 3 inches long (7.62 cm) or less,external. There were 285 killings by a knife or sharp instrument in the 12 months ending March 2018, according to Office for National Statistics (ONS) analysis. One in four (71) of all victims (285) were men aged 18-24,ONS said. Lord Toby Harris, chairman of National Trading Standards, said: ""Restricting the sale of knives to children is clearly a difficult issue for retailers, especially those with large numbers of outlets, staff and delivery partners. ""I am aware that many retailers are working incredibly hard to train staff and introduce robust procedures to stem the flow of knives to children. ""But let's be clear - it's illegal to sell a knife to a child. Our tests show that it's still too easy for a child to buy a knife."" Separately, 100 online test purchases were carried out; children were sold a knife on 41 occasions. Underthe new Offensive Weapons Act,external, retailers will be stopped from delivering knives to residential addresses, in a bid to curb under-18s circumventing age restrictions. The act, which received Royal Assent in May, is currently under public consultation before the new laws come into force. Some online retailers already refuse to deliver knives without the courier checking the person's ID. An Asda spokesman said: ""In April 2019, we became the first retailer toremove all single knives from sale across our storesto help ensure that they do not fall into the wrong hands. ""Whilst we are clearly disappointed with the results from a small number of cases between April 2018 and March 2019, we would like to reassure customers that we have since provided updated training for colleagues."" The spokesman added the supermarket has ""clear Challenge 25 policies"", which require staff to check a customer's proof of age to ensure they are over 18, when buying a restricted item. Tesco UK and Ireland chief executive Jason Tarry said: ""Tesco takes the safety of our colleagues, customers, and the communities we serve very seriously. ""We have made significant changes to our approach to displaying and selling knives, without taking choice away from customers, including a new two-stage age verification process and removing knives from display on the shop floor."" A spokesman for Poundland said: ""As this body [Trading Standards] is aware, we're baffled by their numbers.

Bolton saved as takeover completed,"Bolton Wanderers began the season with a 12-point deduction after going into administration in May Bolton Wanderers' survival has been secured after Football Ventures (Whites) Limited completed its protracted takeover of the club. Administrators had warned the club could be placed into liquidation on Wednesday without a finalised takeover. It looked to have collapsed on Monday, leading to bleak warnings about the future of the 145-year-old club. ""I'm delighted we've finally reached a satisfactory conclusion with the sale,"" said joint administrator Paul Appleton. ""I have every sympathy for the staff, players and fans who have been forced to stand by while their club was taken to the brink. I am delighted their loyalty, dedication and patience has finally been rewarded."" On Tuesday, the English Football League gave Bolton 14 days to complete a deal or face expulsion from the competition. That came as Bury became thefirst club to be expelledfrom the league for 27 years after a takeover bid fell through just before the EFL's deadline. ""At times it has been difficult to keep our counsel but we took a decision to remain on the sidelines even when further damage was being inflicted by delays outside of our control,"" said a statement on behalf of Football Ventures. ""Now we are excited to begin restoring this magnificent football club to its rightful position, securing its future for the fans, the loyal club staff, and the players."" As a result of the takeover, Bolton are now out of administration, with their place in the EFL no longer under threat. ""These past few months have undoubtedly been challenging and, at times, fraught - never more so in the past few days - and I would like to thank all parties for their efforts in achieving the desired outcome,"" said EFL executive chair Debbie Jevans. Could the German model help prevent another Bury/Bolton situation? Appleton praised one of the main creditors, the Eddie Davies Trust, for being ""willing to find a compromise to save the club"" during the talks - but he was critical of the club's former owner Ken Anderson, who he said was responsible for the deal initially collapsing on Monday. He added the Trust was determined ""not to allow Bolton Wanderers to suffer any longer at the hands of Ken Anderson"". ""Sadly, Mr Anderson has used his position as a secured creditor to hamper and frustrate any deal that did not benefit him or suit his purposes,"" he added. ""Thankfully, with the assistance of the Trust and others, we were able to overcome this obstacle."" Bolton, who started the season with a 12-point deduction,called off last week's gameagainst Doncaster Rovers amid welfare concerns for younger players, whilePhil Parkinson also resignedas manager. ""At times, some of the hurdles appeared insurmountable and the frustration felt has been immense, not least by the supporters who have had to endure too many weeks of uncertainty,"" added Appleton. ""Now there can be a fresh start with owners who, I believe, will run the club for the good of the supporters and the community as a whole."" BBC Radio Manchester has attempted to contact Anderson for comment. Fans waited anxiously outside Bolton's stadium on Tuesday before the EFL's 17:00 BST deadline Football Ventures (Whites) Limited, led by Sharon Brittan, were named as preferred bidders on 1 July by administrators David Rubin & Partners. The takeover has since faced numerous hurdles, with the deal appearing to have collapsed completely on Saturday despite being close to completion the previous day. In a statement issued on Monday, the administrators said if they were unable to resurrect the move, the club was ""not in a position to carry on trading"" and would enter liquidation, leading to the ""inevitable loss of over 150 jobs"". Wanderers were beaten 5-0 at home by Ipswich Town on Saturday in front of just 5,454 fans - the lowest attendance for a league game at the University of Bolton Stadium in its 22-year history. With the majority of the club's senior players having left, they have fielded sides made up almost entirely of youth-team players in their five matches so far this campaign - including their youngest-ever side against Coventry City on 10 August. ""It's just fantastic. I was down at the stadium when the statement came through. It's what everybody has been waiting for,"" said Maggie Tetlow, co-founder of the Bolton Wanderers Supporters' Trust. She told BBC Radio 5 Live the new owners have ""a good track record in business"". Bolton were relegated from the Premier League in 2012. Four years later their football existence was threatened as former striker Dean Holdsworth was part of a takeover at the club. Anderson took control after Holdsworth's company Sports Shield was wound up. Wanderers entered administration in May after being relegated from the Championship, before Football Ventures agreed a deal to take over the club. The deal was almost stopped after Laurence Bassini, who had bid to buy the club before administration, was awarded a court order blocking the sale on 8 August. The court order was adjourned, paving the way for the takeover to continue before it eventually collapsed. The club called off their match against Doncaster last week citing welfare concerns, having only five senior outfield players available. Boss Phil Parkinson resigned last Thursday after three years with the club and a young side lost 5-0 against Ipswich on Saturday. Football Ventures eventually complete their takeover with the threat of liquidation and expulsion from the EFL looming.

Festival-goers 'should pay Â£25 tent tax',"Festival-goers should be charged a Â£25 deposit to camp at Reading and Leeds, say campaigners who want to stop so many tents being abandoned every year. After the Bank Holiday festivals, photos emerged showing fields strewn with litter, nearly-new tents, airbeds and even an upright gazebo. Clean Up Britain is now proposing campers pay a deposit which is returned only if they take their tent home. Reading and Leeds organisers were unavailable for comment. The average tent is mostly made of plastic - the equivalent of 8,750 straws or 250 pint cups, according to the Association of Independent Festivals. But festival-goers often find themselves too tired and emotional after a weekend partying to take the time and effort to pack up their belongings - and their tent. What happens to the tents left at Leeds Festival- - BBC News Calls for shops to stop marketing 'festival tents' Festival revellers bask in record temperatures John Read, founder of campaign group Clean Up Britain, told the BBC: ""This is heartbreaking and such a waste of resources - it should not happen. ""You see a lot of people saying they care about the environment but their words and actions don't match up."" He described it as a ""glorified form of flytipping"", as people were just leaving the mess for someone else to clean up. He believes a pitch deposit - or ""tent tax"" - would be a good financial incentive to take tents home - and is keen to speak to festival organisers about introducing his idea. He said his group thought it should be fixed at Â£25 - but others have told him it needed to be higher. Any money made could go into redistributing abandoned tents to homeless charities, scout groups and local community groups, he said. Mr Read is also calling on Reading and Leeds festival organisers to do more to disseminate an environmental message about littering and waste in general. Festival organisers need to do more to get across the environmental message, say campaigners It is not known how many tents - many of them virtually brand new - were left behind at the festivals this year. Charity group, Festival Waste Reclamation and Distribution, which collects unwanted equipment from festivals across the UK, says thousands of tents are abandoned every year, many of them ending up in landfill. Its volunteers are allowed onto sites to salvage sleeping bags, roll mats, tents, clothes, waterproofs and blankets, once everyone has left. These are then given to the most vulnerable in society, including Syrian refugees.

How Brexit broke 'Team Ruth',"All smiles in June 2017 - Ruth Davidson with the new intake of Scottish Tory MPs They were to operate as Team Ruth - a block of Scottish MPs under the leadership of Ruth Davidson. If Theresa May wanted them to vote one way and Ms Davidson wanted them to vote another, they would follow the Scottish leader's line. At least that was what journalists like me were briefed as Ms Davidson assembled her baker's dozen of MPs under the shadow of Stirling Castle for a photo shoot in the aftermath of the 2017 election. In reality, the Scottish and UK Conservative line has - more or less - been the same during the tortuous Brexit process. Commons tries to break Brexit deadlock A guide to MPs' alternative Brexit plans Most Scottish Tories have toed it. But there have been exceptions. Some MPs have dared to do their own thing (or at least to follow someone else's lead). In short, Brexit has broken the unity of Team Ruth. There is within the Scottish Tory group at Westminster a milder micro study of the division that threatens to pull the wider party apart. Ruth Davidson campaigned for Remain, along with other Scottish political leaders At one end of the spectrum, there is Aberdeen South MP Ross Thomson, a Brexit supporter close to Boris Johnson who has twice voted against Theresa May's deal. In the first meaningful vote, he was joined by Moray MP Douglas Ross and John Lamont, the MP for Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk. All three said they were particularly worried about the threat they perceived the so-called Northern Ireland backstop would pose to the integrity of the UK. By the second meaningful vote, Mr Lamont was back on side with the government having accepted the EU's reassurances that the backstop, if used, would be temporary. Please upgrade your browser to view this interactive Enter a postcode, or the name or constituency of your MP  Douglas Ross missed that vote to return home to be with his wife for the birth of their first child. When asked how he would have voted, he said he would have listened to the debate before making up his mind. That left Ross Thomson as the only Scottish Tory rebel on that occasion. Paul Masterton voted for May's Brexit deal in the two meaningful votes Towards the other end of the Brexit spectrum is the East Renfrewshire MP Paul Masterton. He has been promoting a softer Brexit along the lines of Norway-plus. That's staying in the European single market (like Norway) plus maintaining a customs union with the EU (unlike Norway). Reality Check: What is the Norway model? Brexit Basics- The customs union - BBC News He did, however, loyally back the prime minister's Brexit deal in both meaningful votes and urged Brexiteer MPs to do the same or risk no Brexit. The breaking point for him came when Parliament was asked to vote on ruling out no deal in all circumstances. The government instructed its MPs to reject this idea. Mr Masterton refused. He voted against no deal and resigned as a government aide at the Home Office. David Mundell abstained in the vote on ruling out no deal This vote also caused difficulty for the Scottish Secretary, David Mundell, the MP for Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale. He could not bring himself to either vote against the government or to vote against ruling out a no deal Brexit. He was one of several Cabinet ministers to abstain, in a breach of collective responsibility that was tolerated by the prime minister, such is the weakness of her position. Mr Mundell has advocated MPs choosing between Brexit options through indicative votes. However, when it came to the decision on that idea - the amendment in the name of Oliver Letwin - Mr Mundell voted against, as he was obliged to do to keep his government job. Paul Masterton was the only Scottish Tory MP to vote for these indicative votes, presumably so that he can support a softer Brexit. Whether he will be free to do so, or will have to continue rebelling against the Conservative whip to express his preferences remains to be seen. The government has yet to say whether or not it will allow its MPs - including ministers - the freedom to vote as they wish. Nicola Sturgeon took part in the People's Vote march on Saturday Brexit has caused tensions in other Scottish parties too. Labour's Ian Murray, the MP for Edinburgh South, has consistently championed another Brexit referendum, which has not yet become the preferred option of the party's leadership. In the SNP, some MPs believe their leader - Nicola Sturgeon - should be prioritising a second independence referendum over another UK-wide public vote on Brexit. Former Scottish cabinet minister Alex Neil and former party deputy leader Jim Sillars - who supported Brexit - have urged SNP MPs to back Mrs May's deal. Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson is currently on maternity leave But as the party of government at Westminster, inevitably the greatest focus is on the Conservatives. On the key Brexit questions, Ruth Davidson's current thinking is not known as she is on maternity leave aftergiving birth in October last year to her son Finn. She has made occasional political interventions in the months since his arrival - via social media - most notably to back Theresa May when she faced a confidence vote as leader of the Conservative party. It would be fascinating to know what she thinks now and which part of Team Ruth at Westminster is acting as she would wish.

Apple apology after workers heard Siri recordings,"Apple's Siri virtual assistant can respond to spoken queries and commands Apple has apologised following revelations that it paid third-party workers to listen to voice recordings of Siri users. The practice known as ""grading"" has been used by several tech firms as a way of improving the quality of speech recognition. However, Apple, Google and Microsoft all halted such work recently, following public outcry. Apple said it plans to resume grading - but only for Siri users who opt in. The firm added that in the future only its own employees will be able to access recordings, not third-party workers at contracted firms. Earlier this month,the company said it had halted gradingfollowing reports that workers had heard recordings containing intimate remarks made by Siri users. Such recordings can be made accidentally, for example when the Siri app interprets another word or noise as the utterance ""Hey Siri"", which is used to launch voice recognition. Apple and Google stop workers playing back voice recordings Amazon Alexa: Watchdog in discussions over recordings Now, Apple says it has completed a review of such work. ""As a result of our review, we realise we haven't been fully living up to our high ideals, and for that we apologise,""the firm said in a statement,external. Up until grading was halted, 0.2% of Siri audio recordings was reviewed by human workers, Apple added. The company said that three main changes would take place before human grading of Siri recordings was resumed. It said: audio recordings would no longer be retained by default. Instead, Apple employees would rely on computer-generated transcripts of speech Siri users would be able to opt in to share audio recordings - and would be able to opt out ""at any time"" only Apple employees would have access to recordings, and any recordings that had been made ""inadvertently"" would be deleted The turnaround was an unusual move from Apple, said Adam Wright, a tech analyst at market research firm IDC. ""I think they've been caught off-guard a little bit,"" he told the BBC. ""I don't think they've been completely forthcoming or transparent in their use of data."" Part of the controversy over using humans to grade voice recordings was that Siri users may not always have been aware that their conversations could be listened to in this way. The Irish data protection authority, Apple's lead data privacy regulator in Europe, had previously said it was looking into the matter of grading. A spokeswoman for the commission said it had noted Apple's latest statement.

14:30 in Rio: The story of a death,"  By Hugo  Bachega It was about 14:30 on 14 May when Jean Rodrigo da Silva Aldrovande pulled up on Carmen Cintra, a street in a poor district in northern Rio de Janeiro. Few in Alemão actually know Carmen Cintra by its name. Many call it Rua Do Rio, or River Street, because of the polluted stream that runs there, dividing it in two. It was an ordinary day for Jean Rodrigo. The popular Brazilian jiu-jitsu teacher was about to give a class to youngsters at a social project, just as he had been doing for years. He arrived with his eldest son, Juan, and a student, Thiago. Jean Rodrigo parked in his usual spot near the stream and as Juan, 17, went inside to get himself ready, Thiago, 18, waited to help him take in some boxes. It was a warm winter day and Jean Rodrigo was shirtless, having yet to change into his kimono. He was in good spirits. Hours earlier, his martial arts “master” had invited him to referee at a competition, an unexpected honour for a brown belt. Jean Rodrigo with his wife, Andrea Jean Rodrigo with his wife, Andrea  The normally busy street was quiet, and as teacher and student unloaded the car, a police vehicle arrived. Four officers rushed out and positioned themselves on the same side of the street as Jean Rodrigo and Thiago. On the other side of the street, Thiago saw a boy with a rifle. It all happened very quickly. There was no time to run. Having lived most of his life in Alemão, Jean Rodrigo probably knew what was going to happen. Thiago said he had shouted to him “Get down! Get down!” As they both sought cover beside Jean Rodrigo’s car and another parked behind it, the shots came fast. When Thiago realised he had been injured in the leg, he desperately called out to Jean Rodrigo for help: “Teacher, teacher.” But there was no reply. Shot in the head, Jean Rodrigo died instantly with the car keys still in his hand. By the time his wife Andrea Rios arrived at the scene some two hours later, Jean Rodrigo’s body had been covered by a blanket. A group had gathered around it, and there they stayed in a circle into the late evening. Jean Rodrigo had discovered jiu-jitsu almost by accident. When he was young, he had worked as a cleaner at a small gym, and every day after work he would quietly sit by the mat to watch the martial arts classes he could not afford. Over time, he picked up a few moves, saved some money to be properly coached, and eventually became a teacher himself. His family paint a portrait of a well-liked man who offered help in the gym and outside, with words of advice. He had no involvement with gangs, they say, nor had he ever been arrested. “Samurai”, as he was known, often told the students - and his four children - that jiu-jitsu could take them “from Alemão to the world”. He knew that for many of them, it could be very much either this or falling into a life of crime. It is easy to see why. The graffiti on the houses in Alemão celebrate the powerful group of drug traffickers Red Command, or Comando Vermelho, leaving no doubt about who is the authority here. Jean Rodrigo (sitting, centre) with fellow jiu jitsu enthusiasts Jean Rodrigo (sitting, centre) with fellow jiu jitsu enthusiasts I meet Andrea for the first time six weeks after Jean Rodrigo’s death, a day after he would have turned 40. The couple had got together on Brazil’s Valentine’s Day - 12 June - in 2018, and had quickly become “like husband and wife”, she says. The house they had shared, not far from Alemão, belonged to Andrea’s grandmother. It was so small that the living room was the only place they could put the fridge. On it was an old magnet that read: Peace. “Everybody knows it’s a violent area, and that’s why Jean Rodrigo wanted the project there,” Andrea says. “It was the only opportunity these children have.” He was a reference point for many of them, she says, and some called him late at night or at weekends, ""sometimes crying”, looking for guidance. Maneco Team, the martial arts project, had some nine students when Jean Rodrigo started it in 2012; seven years later, there were about 90. The club mainly relied on donations, scarce at the best of times. Classes were held in a room with high walls and peeling paint. Often students would get water from the taxi stand across the street because they could not get their ageing drinking fountain fixed. Kimonos were handed down when they had been grown out of, or someone had scraped the money together for a new one. Jean Rodrigo, Andrea says, had warned her right from the start that his life was all about Brazilian jiu-jitsu. This type of martial art, based on taking the fight to the ground, is now popular around the world and earlier this year a friend offered Jean Rodrigo the chance to do some coaching in Abu Dhabi. But he turned it down. “Who was he going to help there? People need help here,” Andrea says. “He said: ‘My place is here, in Brazil, at Alemão.’” The Maneco Team received funding from the federal government, just enough to pay Jean Rodrigo 950 reais ($250; £200) a month. It was not a lot, but he still used some of it to cover the fees for his students at competitions. Jean Rodrigo himself competed and, in April, won a bronze medal at a regional championship. He was getting ready for two bigger tournaments in May, including a national competition. His main income came from delivering gas bottles with his father early in the morning. There were times when he could not pay for either petrol for his car or the bus ticket to go to the lessons. So he would go by foot, and that meant walking for well over an hour under a sun that spares no-one. “He lived for this,” says Diego, his brother. On the day of his death, Jean Rodrigo had spent a rare morning with his wife at home. He was “euphoric” after the phone call asking him to be a referee, says Andrea. “He was joking, making hand gestures referees usually do, saying to me: ‘You’ve been penalised!’ It was his dream.” How Jean Rodrigo was killed is not yet completely clear, but Andrea is certain that he was shot by the police. “You think a lot of things. Was it because he was black? At the entrance to a favela? Was he mistaken for someone else? They could have asked for his ID. He was a law-abiding citizen. Why did they shoot him?” In an account of the events Thiago sent to the family on WhatsApp, he says he and Jean Rodrigo lay on the ground next to the car. “I don’t know whether the police positioned their rifle under the car... and shot [at us] thinking we were criminals. I heard a lot of shots. They fired under the car [towards] where we were.” Diego was one of the first to arrive at the scene. There, he says, he found four empty rifle bullet casings where the officers had positioned themselves, 3-5m (10-16ft) from where Jean Rodrigo and Thiago had hidden. There were bullet marks in the gutter near where they had been crouching, he adds. When Juan came out of the gym and saw his father’s motionless body on the ground, he shouted to the policemen “You’ve shot a resident, you’ve shot a resident,” Diego says, but the officers got back in their car and left. As word spread in Alemão that their coach had been killed, the impromptu gathering around Jean Rodrigo’s body grew into a protest against what was seen as another police killing.  There are hundreds of favelas in Rio, possibly even 1,000. Experts say decades of state neglect have allowed gangs to flourish, and in many of them they are the de facto rulers. The police presence is so weak that when they do come, it is often to conduct operations. Gun battles are almost the norm. For a long time Alemão, a maze of more than a dozen slums built on hill slopes, was considered one of the city’s most dangerous. Ten years or so ago, before Rio hosted the 2014 World Cup and the 2016 Olympic Games, there was hope that things could finally change as government programmes brought much-needed policing and social services to some areas, leading to a drop in crime. But money for these projects practically ended as recession took hold in Brazil in 2014. Violence spiked, and the federal government temporarily intervened last year. In an unprecedented decision, the army was put in charge of security. While there was a reduction in some types of crime, critics still question whether it has had any long-term impact. Last October, Wilson Witzel, a 51-year-old conservative former judge and marine, was elected governor of Rio de Janeiro state, promising to be tough on crime. During his campaign, he said the authorities would “dig graves” to bury criminals if necessary. Days after being elected, he vowed to “slaughter” anyone caught carrying a rifle. “The police will do the right thing,” he told a newspaper, “aim at their little heads and fire! So there’s no mistake.” Legal experts argue that shooting at people is unlawful if officers are not acting in self-defence. Witzel has an ally in Brazil’s far-right PresidentJair Bolsonaro, a former army captain and congressman for Rio, who also took office in January. They agree on many things, including that officers should not face charges if they kill on duty.    “A policeman who doesn’t kill,” Bolsonaro once said, “isn’t a policeman.” Wilson Witzel and President Jair Bolsonaro Wilson Witzel and President Jair Bolsonaro Bolsonaro, whose trademark gesture is a weapon with his thumb and index finger, has also worked to ease citizens’ access to guns so, he says, they will be able to defend themselves. Under Witzel’s watch, police raids in the greater Rio area increased 42% between March and June, according to a study by Rede de Observatórios de Segurança, or Security Observatory Network, a national group of researchers. The raids often take place in densely populated favelas, with large numbers of officers, heavy weapons, armoured vehicles and even helicopters with snipers. While I was in Rio, I downloaded the app Fogo Cruzado (Crossfire) which monitors operations and shootings and is frequently used by residents to avoid risky areas. I was alarmed by how frequent these raids were. Between January and July, police operations resulted in 1,075 deaths, an average of five per day, the highest number since official records began 20 years ago. Most of those who die are male, black and young. And while many are suspected criminals who have died in confrontations, there is also an unknown number of unarmed people and bystanders among the victims. “Both the state and federal governments are openly encouraging the killings of people,” says Dr Ignacio Cano, a professor of sociology at the State University of Rio (UERJ), and one of Brazil’s leading experts on violence. “In the past it was a more masked, subtler incentive. Today, it has become official policy.” In June, a television programme showed several armed men walking freely in Cidade de Deus, the favela in western Rio made famous by the movie City of God. All the while, children in  uniform appeared to be making their way to school. “In other parts of the world,” Witzel said, referring to the images during a speech to announce the expansion of a security programme, “we’d be allowed to send a missile to blow those [suspects] up.” He was applauded. While most of the battles between police and heavily-armed criminals have taken place on the streets of the favelas, Witzel, who had no previous political experience before becoming governor, has not hidden his enthusiasm for putting police marksmen in the sky. In May, he posted a video of himself on Twitter aboard a helicopter next to a sniper saying: “We’ll put an end to banditry... It’s over!” Snipers on police helicopters - popularly called “caveirão voador”,or “flying big skull” after the name for armoured police vehicles, “caveirão” - opened fire in 11 operations in the first six months of this year across Rio, according to Fogo Cruzado. Wilson Witzel Wilson Witzel One morning in Maré, Rio’s largest favela complex, Douglas Oliveira was working at the local library overseeing some children when he heard the sound of fireworks, the usual warning given by criminals that the police were about to launch a raid. As he left the building with a young girl, he saw a police helicopter with a sniper. “It shot in my direction. They didn’t care,” Oliveira, 24, says. “I started to pray. I thought about running.” But if he had run, he says, he thought he could have been mistaken for a suspect and become a direct target. So he kept walking, terrified, until he finally arrived at a nearby community activist office. A non-profit group based in the same favela, Redes da Maré, posted a video showing at least 19 bullet marks on the ground, which had allegedly been caused by a sniper on board a police helicopter in May. After the operation, the director of a school in the area posted pictures of a huge sign she had put on its roof two years ago, reading: “School. Don’t shoot.” Snipers, Witzel said, had also been deployed on the ground in undisclosed locations across the state. When asked by a newspaper about how many people had been shot dead, he said he had “no idea” because it was not his job to keep a tally of who was being killed by the police. Following Witzel’s video on the helicopter, Renata Souza, an opposition state parliamentarian, called on the United Nations to investigate the operations, saying the governor was personally leading a “policy of massacre”. She had already made a similar request to the Organization of American States. Renata Souza Renata Souza  “We don’t have the death penalty,” Souza, who also heads the Human Rights Commission at Rio State Assembly, tells me, “but Witzel is making this the policy in favelas and suburbs.” A month later, federal prosecutors said officers who had opened fire from helicopters would be investigated for possible crimes. At the protest next to Jean Rodrigo’s body after his death, friends took turns to pay emotional tributes. “We won’t forget the things he did,” one man told the crowd, “we need to keep [him] in our hearts.” Another said: “We have to continue what he started.” By the evening, journalists had gathered at the scene. Jean Rodrigo’s mother Sandra gave an emotional interview, saying: “When will [Witzel’s] police stop killing our sons? Ask Witzel. When will the police stop killing workers? Fathers?” Witzel himself described Jean Rodrigo’s death as “sad”. “It won’t end in impunity… Those found responsible will be tried in the courts,” he wrote on Twitter a day later. The governor’s words were “beautiful”, says Andrea, but not enough. “Nothing will bring [Jean Rodrigo] back, but at the least it can’t remain unsolved.” The police, she says, have not yet told her anything about what happened that day. Rio’s military police department said in an email to the BBC that four military officers who were in a patrol car had come under fire near the Carmen Cintra street by two armed men on two motorbikes. After a gunfight, they returned to the police station, unaware that people had been hit. But investigating cases involving the police is not easy. Paulo Roberto Mello Cunha, a state prosecutor, leads a team that looks into allegations of police violence, but mostly there is not a lot it can do. “You have to count on the police to investigate the police,” he says. “I don’t do forensics, for example.” States in Brazil have two separate police forces - the military force in charge of public order, and the civil force to carry out forensics and investigations. Apart from the chronic lack of personnel and resources, Cunha’s team often struggles with inadequate evidence from crime scenes that have not been preserved, sometimes intentionally. There are frequent claims from relatives and activists of people being taken to hospital already dead in alleged attempts by officers to cover up possible wrongdoing, or even of guns and drugs being put next to victims’ bodies as ways to incriminate them. I was told that residents and Jean Rodrigo’s relatives had gathered next to his body to protect the area until the forensics team arrived. His family also quickly released his pay cheque from the federal government and his jiu-jitsu certificates, hoping it would demonstrate that he was a working man with no links with criminals. Often, fearful witnesses remain silent and prosecutors reject taking on investigations, aware that they could become targets. Cunha himself has been given bodyguards after he and his family received threats. “We rarely have a proper investigation,” he says. “Sometimes it works. Depending on the stars, it’ll work. But that’s not the rule.” Since 2016, when his group was set up, they have investigated some 1,300 cases. Charges have been pressed in less than 5% of them. “Before, we had 0% of the cases, so I think we’re building something,” he says. “The bar is pretty low.” “I won’t backtrack,” Witzel said in August, arguing his government was “in the right way”. Proof of this, he said, was the drop in homicides - there were 2,392 cases in the state between January and July, a drop of 23% from 2018. Violent thefts and robberies are also falling, while the police have seized large amounts of drugs and weapons. The Red Command - Rio’s largest drug gang, controlling a vast number of neighbourhoods - was even running out of ammunition, Witzel claimed. He also said that drug traffickers should be legally defined as terrorists, with harsher sentences. “You can’t combat terrorism with flowers,” he said last month. “The message has been sent: Don’t fight the police.” It is not yet clear whether the improvements celebrated by Witzel are a direct result of his policies, experts say. The fall in the homicide rate, in particular, appears to follow a national trend - official numbers suggest 6,543 cases nationwide between January and February, a 20% drop on the same time last year. While Witzel has focused on drug traffickers, critics say he has downplayed the threat from violent paramilitary groups created by policemen, active and retired, known as milícias. None of the deaths in police operations between January and June occurred in districts where they are active, according to UOL Notícias, a news website. Witzel’s office did not respond to requests for an interview. Outside Rio’s poorest districts, there is some support for Witzel’s policies, as frightened residents despair of seeing an end to the violence. “We have to kill those boys,” one resident of Barra da Tijuca, a fashionable seaside neighbourhood where President Bolsonaro has a private residence, tells me, referring to drug traffickers. When I say innocent people are also being killed, he replies: “It’s the price!” The police were responsible for almost a third of all violent deaths - essentially any death that is not accidental or natural - in Rio de Janeiro between January and July, according to the state’s Institute for Public Safety. Parliamentarian Renata Souza says there is “widespread fear” that extrajudicial executions are being carried out. “There are operations in which the killings are indiscriminate... These are massacres committed by the state.” In February, residents of Fallet-Fogueteiro in the centre of Rio said nine men were tortured and stabbed by officers in a house, killed even after they had surrendered. Police said the suspects had responded with gunfire when they arrived, and the residence reportedly had 182 bullet holes on it. Locals, however, said the police had surrounded the place and that there had been no gunfight. In total, 15 people were killed, the deadliest raid in Rio in 12 years. Witzel defended the operation as “legitimate”. In May’s operation with the helicopter in Maré, police said they were looking for a suspected drug lord. Pictures of pupils fleeing a school as the police hovered overhead went viral. Eight people were killed in the raid, four of them in a single house. Again, residents said the men had already surrendered when they were killed. A witness, whose house was broken into by the heavily armed suspected drug traffickers, told me on condition of anonymity: “One of [the suspects] said ‘Perdi’, ‘I’ve lost it.’ The policeman said: ‘You didn’t only lose. My order is to kill.’” Both cases are still being investigated by the police. But Jurema Werneck, executive director of Amnesty International Brasil, says authorities are allowing this “violent approach” by officers. “Killing people can’t be considered public policy,” Werneck, who was herself born in a favela, says. “We have the proper way to deal with [suspected criminals]. It has to be in front of justice and not in front of guns.”  A number of operations have drawn comparisons with some of the policies Rodrigo Duterte, the president of the Philippines, has implemented in his own war on drugs. Some 6,600 people have been killed there since 2016, according to police, but activists put this number at 27,000. Witzel, however, rejects the accusation that officers shoot indiscriminately. “The police,” he said in May, “don’t kill innocents.” The military police department says its operations are based on “prior planning and executed within the law” and that “criminals are the ones who typically initiate confrontation”. Col Carlos Fernando Ferreira Belo, president of Rio’s Military Police Officers Federation, the group that represents officers, says operations are usually “very intense and stressful” for the police. As a rule, he says, officers are attacked by criminals and that they “have to respond in the same proportion”. In the first six months of the year, seven policemen were killed while on duty in Rio. “The fact that in the confrontations criminals die I’d say ‘Thanks God!’ and I applaud it,” says Belo. “Killing is not the mission of the military police, but dying even less so.” Over four days in January, two men were shot dead in the northern neighbourhood of Manguinhos, with residents blaming snipers based in a tower at the civil police headquarters nearby. The cases are being investigated by the police and Cunha’s team, but a post-mortem examination published by Extra newspaper said one of them had been killed by a bullet fired from above. There was no suggestion any of them were armed. After six people aged between 16 and 21 were killed in police operations in five days this month, Meia Hora, a local tabloid, printed bullet marks on its front page with the headline: “In Rio, killing is a game.”  On the locked gate to the building where Jean Rodrigo used to hold his jiu-jitsu classes is a sign saying the team has moved. “Some children no longer felt safe there,” says Marcos Vinicius, one of Jean Rodrigo’s friends who now helps with the lessons. Others simply did not want to go back to their old place. They felt Jean Rodrigo everywhere. Andrea has moved, because she too felt his presence in the home they shared. “The joy I had,” she says, “is over.” When Jean Rodrigo was buried, two days after he was killed, his students wore kimonos and brought the medals they had won in competitions. They launched white balloons in the air asking for peace, and applauded when the jiu-jitsu “master” posthumously gave Jean Rodrigo a black belt.

S America nations to meet over Amazon crisis,"This video can not be played ""It's extremely upsetting... to see this kind of devastation"" - the BBC's Will Grant flew over northern Rondonia state South American countries will meet to discuss a coordinated response to the fires ravaging the Amazon basin next week, Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro has announced. It comes after he refused a G7 offer of $22m (Â£18m) following a spat with French President Emmanuel Macron. Governors of the nine worst affected regions have urged him to reconsider. Mr Bolsonaro has now accepted Chile's offer of four planes to fight the fires, the most in Brazil since 2010. He revealed all countries in the Amazon region, apart from Venezuela, will meet on 6 September to further discuss a common policy. However, speaking after meeting his Chilean counterpart Sebastian Pinera, Mr Bolsonaro said he was not yet prepared to accept the G7 offer. ""The French government called me a liar,"" he said, according to Reuters news agency. ""Only after it has recanted what it said about me ... and the Brazilian people, who do not accept this diminution of the Amazon's sovereignty ... then we can talk again."" The Amazon is a vital carbon store that slows down the pace of global warming. President Bolsonaro said last week that his government lacked the resources to fight the fires. This video can not be played Why the Amazon rainforest helps fight climate change As international concern over the fires spread, leaders of the seven leading industrial nations meeting in France offered $22m to help fight the fires. Amazon fires: Ten of your questions answered Amazon: Lungs of the planet What about Bolivia's Amazon fires? President Macron, who was hosting the summit, said the funds would be made available immediately - primarily to pay for more firefighting planes. But President Bolsonaro rejected the offer arguing that the G7 countries were treating Brazil like ""a colony or a no-man's land"". That is not entirely clear yet. There has been a lot of back and forth on this. After ruling out accepting the aid, President Bolsonaro softened his stance a little on Tuesday saying he would consider doing so, if President Macron apologised for insulting him by calling him a liar - words he echoed on Wednesday. Altamira is one of the areas most devastated by the fires And following President Bolsonaro's meeting with the governors late on Tuesday, presidential spokesman Rego Barros said the Brazilian government ""is open to receiving financial support from organisations and countries"". However, Mr Barros stipulated that the aid would have to have the ""total governance of the Brazilian people"". There has been no response yet from the French government or the G7 countries. The governor of MaranhÃ£o state, FlÃ¡vio Dino, said he and his counterparts from other affected states had told Mr Bolsonaro that ""it's not the moment to turn down money"". Apart from the $22m the G7 countries offered,Hollywood actor Leonardo DiCaprio also pledged $5m to help fight the fires. Apple CEO Tim Cook also tweeted that the company would be ""donating to help preserve the Amazon rainforest's biodiversity"" but he did not name a figure,external. US PresidentDonald Trump tweeted that Mr Bolsonaro and Brazil ""have the full and complete support of the USA"",external. Reuters news agency says it has been told by a diplomatic source in Brasilia that the Brazilian government has accepted $12.2m from the UK government. The government says it has deployed 44,000 soldiers to seven states to combat the fires. Firefighters and soldiers have been deployed But the area affected is huge Prosecutors are also investigating allegations that some of the fires were trigged by the illegal clearing of land. The justice ministry says that federal police officers would be sent to the fire zones to assist other state agencies in combating ""illegal deforestation"". Data published by Brazil's space agency,externalsuggests there are. The agency, known as Inpe, says there have been more than 83,000 fires between 1 January 2019 and 27 August 2019. That is a 77% rise compared to the same period in 2018. Nasa has also warned,externalthat the ""2019 fires season has the highest fire count since 2012"". BBC analysis has also foundthat the high number of fires being recorded coincides with a sharp drop in fines being handed out for environmental violations. Jorgimar Alberto, from Roraima, one of the states most affected by the fires, has seen the burning of most of the land surrounding his wooden house. ""It's a risky situation, we have lots of crops here and everything is burning, such as the cashew trees,"" he told the BBC. ""I even had to keep the animals [inside] so that they don't burn as well. Every year it is the same, these fires are disturbing the region a lot."" Environmental officials helped him extinguish the fires last week only for them to reignite, he said. His wife could not stand staying in the house with the smell of burning and the threat getting ever closer, so she left. Jorgimar Alberto Dr Daniel Pires, meanwhile, told Brazil's Folha de S. Paulo newspaper that the number of children he had seen with respiratory problems since the early part of the month had doubled. ""This period has been very tough. The dry weather and the smoke causes many problems for children, such as pneumonia, coughing and secretion,"" the paediatrician, who works at Cosme e Damia Children's hospital in the Rondonia state capital of Porto Velho, said. But lumberyard owner Edson Oliveira from southern Amazonas said he did not believe the media coverage about the Amazon. ""In my opinion, the parts that are burning are the same that burn every year,"" he told the BBC. Asked what he would like politicians to do for the Amazon, he said that he would like ""economic alternatives for people here, to find a way we can make use of the natural wealth we have here"". ""It's no use pointing the finger at what's wrong without bringing alternatives to people,"" he said.

Queen approves Parliament suspension,"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""We're not going to wait until October 31st"" Parliament will be suspended just days after MPs return to work in September - and only a few weeks before the Brexit deadline. Boris Johnson said a Queen's Speech would take place after the suspension, on 14 October, to outline his ""very exciting agenda"". But it means the time MPs have to pass laws to stop a no-deal Brexit on 31 October would be cut. House of Commons Speaker John Bercow said it was a ""constitutional outrage"". The Speaker, who does not traditionally comment on political announcements, continued: ""However it is dressed up, it is blindingly obvious that the purpose of [suspending Parliament] now would be to stop [MPs] debating Brexit and performing its duty in shaping a course for the country."" LIVE: Reaction to government's move Kuenssberg: A decisive and intensely risky step Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson 'close to quitting' How do you suspend Parliament? Brexitcast: We're going to need a bigger klaxon Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: ""Suspending Parliament is not acceptable, it is not on. What the prime minister is doing is a smash and grab on our democracy to force through a no deal,"" he said. He said when MPs return to the Commons next Tuesday, ""the first thing we'll do is attempt legislation to prevent what [the PM] is doing"", followed by a vote of no confidence ""at some point"". This video can not be played Corbyn: ""What is Boris Johnson so afraid of?"" Hundreds of protesters gathered in Westminster on Wednesday evening chanting ""stop the coup"" and carrying anti-Brexit placards and EU flags. The demonstration, which was organised hours beforehand, started outside Parliament before spreading towards Downing Street. At the scene, BBC correspondent Richard Galpin described the atmosphere as peaceful and lively. He said ""good-natured"" protesters on College Green broke through barriers which had been in place to separate live TV crews from members of the public - before traffic on Parliament Square was blocked by some people who sat down in the road. Several protesters he spoke to indicated this was only the beginning of the disruption, with more demonstrations being organised for the weekend. Protesters gathered on College Green in central London Three Conservative members of the Queen's Privy Council took the request to suspend Parliament to the monarch's Scottish residence in Balmoral on Wednesday morning on behalf of the prime minister. It has now been approved, allowing the government to suspend Parliament no earlier than Monday 9 September and no later than Thursday 12 September, until Monday 14 October. Allow Twitter content?

Leader of the House Jacob Rees-Mogg, who was at the meeting with the Queen, said the move was a ""completely proper constitutional procedure."" Earlier, Mr Johnson said suggestions the suspension was motivated by a desire to force through a no deal were ""completely untrue"". He said he did not want to wait until after Brexit ""before getting on with our plans to take this country forward"", and insisted there would still be ""ample time"" for MPs to debate the UK's departure. ""We need new legislation. We've got to be bringing forward new and important bills and that's why we are going to have a Queen's Speech,"" Mr Johnson added. Shutting down Parliament - known as prorogation - happens after the prime minister advises the Queen to do it. The decision to do it now is highly controversial because opponents say it would stop MPs being able to play their full democratic part in the Brexit process. In full: PM's letter to MPs Pound falls on prorogation announcement A number of high profile figures,including former Prime Minister John Major, have threatened to go to the courts to stop it, and a legal challenge led by the SNP's justice spokeswoman, Joanna Cherry,is already working its way through the Scottish courts. After the announcement, Sir John said he had ""no doubt"" Mr Johnson's motive was to ""bypass a sovereign Parliament that opposes his policy on Brexit"", and he would continue to seek legal advice. BBC royal correspondent Jonny Dymond said it was established precedent to prorogue Parliament before a Queen's Speech, albeit generally more briefly, and rarely, if ever, at such a constitutionally charged time. He said it was ""Her Majesty's Government"" in name only and it was her role to take the advice of her ministers, so she would prorogue Parliament if asked to. It is not possible to mount a legal challenge to the Queen's exercise of her personal prerogative powers. But anti-Brexit campaigner Gina Miller -who previously won a legal battle against ministers over Article 50- has made a judicial review application to the courts about Mr Johnson's decision. She told the BBC's Clive Coleman: ""If the intention of using this prorogation - and the effect - is that it limits Parliament sovereignty, then we believe that's illegal and unconstitutional."" This has been an extraordinarily long Parliamentary session, and governments have the right to shut up shop and return to announce their proposals in a new one, with all the golden carriages, fancy Westminster costumes, banging of doors and splendour that goes with it. But that new timetable means Parliament will be suspended for longer than had been expected - it's only a matter of days, but those are days that might matter enormously. Boris Johnson secured his place in No 10 by promising he'd do whatever it takes to leave the EU at Halloween, so this decisive and intensely risky plan will satisfy many of those who backed him. But some others in his government are worried - moving now, even with the accompanying controversy, he sets the stage and the terms for an epic fight with MPs on all sides. Read more from Laura The PM says he wants to leave the EU on 31 October with a deal, but it is ""do or die"" and he is willing to leave without one rather than miss the deadline. That position has prompted a number of opposition MPs to come together to try to block a possible no deal, and on Tuesday they announced that they intended to use parliamentary process to do so. What is a vote of no confidence? What is no deal? And can MPs really stop it? No-deal Brexit opponents agree strategy But with Parliament set to be suspended, opponents have only a few days next week to push for their changes. Senior Tory backbencher and former attorney general Dominic Grieve said the move by Mr Johnson could lead to a vote of no confidence - something opposition parties have left on the table as another option to stop no deal. ""There is plenty of time to do that if necessary [and] I will certainly vote to bring down a Conservative government that persists in a course of action which is so unconstitutional,"" he said. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said MPs must come together to stop the plan next week, or ""today will go down in history as a dark one indeed for UK democracy"". Mr Johnson has written to MPs to outline his plan, adding: ""There will be a significant Brexit legislative programme to get through but that should be no excuse for a lack of ambition!"" He mentioned the NHS, tackling crime, infrastructure investment and the cost of living as important issues. He also called on Parliament to show ""unity and resolve"" in the run up to the 31 October so the government ""stands a chance of securing a new deal"" with the EU. But a senior EU source told the BBC's Brussels correspondent Adam Fleming the bloc's position was clear and was not contingent on the machinations of the UK Parliament. There has been considerable anger at Mr Johnson's move from across the political spectrum. Former Tory Chancellor Philip Hammond called it ""profoundly undemocratic"". Shutdown 'a callous political ploy' Welsh Remainers angry at move The leader of the Liberal Democrats, Jo Swinson, said it was a ""dangerous and unacceptable course of action"". ""He knows the people would not choose a no deal and that elected representatives wouldn't allow it. He is trying to stifle their voices,"" she said. The leader of the SNP in Westminster, Ian Blackford, accused Mr Johnson of ""acting like a dictator"", while First Minister of Wales Mark Drakeford said he wanted to ""close the doors"" on democracy. This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon says Boris Johnson is acting like a ""tin pot dictator"" Others, though, have defended the plan. Conservative Party Chairman James Cleverly said setting out a legislative programme via a Queen's Speech was what ""all new governments do"". US President Donald Trumptweeted his support for Mr Johnson,external, saying it ""would be very hard"" for Mr Corbyn to seek a no-confidence vote against the PM, ""especially in light of the fact that Boris is exactly what the UK has been looking for"". Brexit Party MEP Alex Phillips said MPs ""only had themselves to blame"" for the move. She told BBC News: ""They have made themselves the obstacle in front of delivering the referendum result. Boris Johnson is saying he now needs to remove that obstacle, and quite right too."" The leader of the DUP, Arlene Foster, also welcomed the decision to suspend Parliament and have a Queen's Speech, but said the terms of her party's confidence and supply agreement with the Conservatives would now be reviewed. ""This will be an opportunity to ensure our priorities align with those of the government,"" she added. This video can not be played What does proroguing Parliament mean? Parliament is normally suspended - or prorogued - for a short period before a new session begins. It is done by the Queen, on the advice of the prime minister. Parliamentary sessions normally last a year, but the current one has been going on for more than two years - ever since the June 2017 election. When Parliament is prorogued, no debates and votes are held - and most laws that haven't completed their passage through Parliament die a death. This is different to ""dissolving"" Parliament - where all MPs give up their seats to campaign in a general election. The last two times Parliament was suspended for a Queen's Speech that was not after a general election the closures lasted for four and 13 working days respectively. If this prorogation happens as expected, it will see Parliament closed for 23 working days. MPs have to approve recess dates, but they cannot block prorogation.

Suspension 'a callous political ploy',"The UK is due to leave the EU on 31 October, with or without a deal The government's move to suspend Parliament has been criticised by Sinn FÃ©in, the SDLP, the Ulster Unionists and the Alliance Party. But Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Arlene Foster welcomed the move. It emerged on Wednesday thatthe government would ask the Queen to suspend Parliament in September. That will make way for Boris Johnson's new administration to hold a Queen's Speech - laying out the government's plans - on 14 October. On Tuesday, opposition parties at Westminsteragreed to work together to avoid a no-deal Brexit on 31 October. If Parliament is suspended, MPs are unlikely to have time to pass any laws that could stop the prime minister taking the UK out of the EU without a deal. Job of all MPs is to deliver Brexit - Johnson 10 ways no-deal Brexit could affect you What is the UK doing to get ready for a no-deal Brexit? Sinn FÃ©in has described the move to suspend Parliament as a ""callous political play"". Conor Murphy, one of the party's senior MLAs, said it meant a no-deal Brexit is now the most likely outcome and that Irish interests were not being protected. Mr Murphy said the prime minister's move was not aimed in any way at helping restore Stormont and said the DUP was ""foolish"" for backing Mr Johnson. SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said the move was ""disgraceful"" and ""anti-democratic"". In a letter to all MPs, urging them to support a motion of no confidence in the prime minister, he said Mr Johnson ""doesn't care"" about the ""fragile complexities that underpin peace and prosperity in Northern Ireland"".

TÃ¡naiste Simon Coveney said the British government ""seems to be simply wiping the slate clean on the Irish issue"". He said: ""We can never sign an agreement with that approach so we've always said that if there is a no-deal Brexit, it will be the choice of a British prime minister and a British parliament. ""We spent many months putting together a withdrawal agreement which was a compromise on both sides, in order to get a fair deal for the UK and the EU. Simon Coveney was speaking outside a conference in Paris on Wednesday ""It protected the peace process on the island of Ireland and allowed the Republic of Ireland to stay in the EU single market while preventing physical border infrastructure re-emerging on the island of Ireland, which was a source of such tension in the past."" But DUP leader Arlene Foster welcomed the decision to hold a Queen's Speech. The confidence-and-supply agreement her party struck in 2017 to support the Conservatives would be reviewed in advance of the new Parliament session, she said. ""The new session of Parliament will set a new domestic legislative programme which can deal with the matters most important to people such as their safety, their schools and their hospitals,"" she added. ""In the meantime, we will continue our work with the prime minister to strengthen the union, deliver a sensible deal as we exit the EU and restore devolution in Northern Ireland."" TUV leader Jim Allister said it is ""time to get on with getting out"". He added: ""Three years on, the patience of the people has been exhausted. ""Today's news would appear to bring us closer to implementing the will of the people. Assuming it plays out like that, today will be remembered as a good day for democracy."" Allow Twitter content?

However, the MEP Naomi Long, the leader of the Alliance Party, said parliamentary democracy was being ""sacrificed on the altar of Brexit"". She criticised the DUP for ""giving cover to this parliamentary coup"". The Ulster Unionist leader, Robin Swann,  called the suspension of Parliament an ""abuse of process"". ""Every piece of legislation that was in process has now fallen. There is no opportunity now for MPs to come back with any serious time for meaningful debate and challenge. ""I think it leaves Northern Ireland very much on the sideline."" This was more than a bolt from the blue. It was a hard-hitting serve, back across the court toward opposition MPs who want to block a no-deal Brexit. Already there's been an angry reaction from some of the Stormont parties, who don't buy the government's argument that this is simply about ""getting on"" with the domestic agenda. A lot remains unclear about the coming days but one thing is certain: talks to restore Stormont before the Brexit deadline are bound to fade further into the background. In a letter to MPs on Wednesday, Mr Johnson confirmed his government's intention to end Parliament's current session on 10 September in preparation for a Queen's Speech. The letter also mentions the Northern Ireland (Executive Formation and Exercise of Functions) Act, which includes a provision that the government must regularly debate reports on progress to restore Stormont. Mr Johnson confirmed that MPs would hold the first of those debates on 9 September, one day before he wants Parliament to be suspended. It would not need to debate another report until after Parliament returned on 14 October. MPs had originally backed that provision being added to the Northern Ireland Act to make it harder for the government to prorogue Parliament but the dates specified in the act coincide with the government's timetable for prorogation.

Parliament suspension sparks furious backlash,"This video can not be played ""The outrage is phoney"": Jacob Rees-Mogg defends the decision to suspend Parliament The prime minister's decision to suspend Parliament has prompted an angry backlash from MPs and opponents of a no-deal Brexit. It sparked protests across the country, a legal challenge and a petition with more than a million signatures. The government said the five-week suspension in September and October will still allow time to debate Brexit. Commons leader Jacob Rees-Mogg said the outrage was ""phoney"", and that the move was ""constitutional and proper"". ""The candyfloss of outrage we've had over the last 24 hours, which I think is almost entirely confected, is from people who never wanted to leave the European Union,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""This is the greatest period of anger for them, or of confected anger, because after 31 October we will have left,"" he added. Kuenssberg: A decisive and intensely risky step Ruth Davidson quits as Scottish Conservative leader How do you suspend Parliament? Conservative peer Lord Young of Cookham has resigned from his role as government whip in the House of Lords in protest at suspension, known as prorogation. In his resignation letter, he said the timing and length of the suspension ""risks undermining the fundamental role of Parliament at a critical time in our history"". Meanwhile, Ruth Davidson has also confirmed she is quitting as leader of the Scottish Conservatives after eight years in the job. In a statement she said ""much had changed"" both politically and personally during that time, which had led her to tender her resignation. Ms Davidson - who backed Remain in the 2016 EU referendum - added she had never sought to hide the ""conflict"" she felt over Brexit, and urged Mr Johnson to get a Brexit deal. On Wednesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said a Queen's Speech would take place after the suspension, on 14 October, to outline his ""very exciting agenda"". This video can not be played ""They just want to undermine the democratic vote that's already taken place"" - voters in Harborne, Birmingham react Cabinet minister Michael Gove said the suspension, which was approved by the Queen on Wednesday, was ""certainly not"" a political move to obstruct opposition to the UK leaving the EU without a deal. Mr Rees-Mogg said this parliamentary session had been one of the longest in almost 400 years, so it was right to suspend it and start a new session. MPs voted by 498 votes to 114 to leave the EU bytriggering Article 50 in February 2017. That began the countdown to the UK's departure, which is now just over two months away. But Ruth Fox - director of parliamentary experts the Hansard Society - said this prorogation was ""significantly longer than we would normally have"" for the purpose of starting a new parliamentary session. Ms Fox said that depending on the day the suspension began - and on whether MPs would have voted to have a party conference recess at all - the prorogation could ""potentially halve"" the number of days MPs have to scrutinise the government's Brexit position. The prime minister says he wants to leave the EU at the end of October with a deal, but is willing to leave without one rather than miss the deadline. On Wednesday, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn described Mr Johnson's move as ""a smash-and-grab on our democracy"" in order to force through no-deal by leaving MPs without enough time to pass laws in Parliament. Anti-Brexit campaigner Gina Miller -who previously won a legal battle against ministers over Article 50- has made a judicial review application to the courts about Mr Johnson's decision. Shadow international trade secretary Barry Gardiner said Labour would be looking at calling for an emergency debate. ""We will seek to try and put through the appropriate legislation in this constrained timetable that the government has now put before us,"" he said. This video can not be played Corbyn: ""What is Boris Johnson so afraid of?"" Conservative MP Ken Clarke called Mr Johnson's move ""outrageous conduct"", while David Lidington, who served as Cabinet Office Minister under former PM Theresa May, said it would limit the ability of MPs to hold the government to account. The leader of the Liberal Democrats, Jo Swinson, told BBC Newsnight that the prime minister ""is prepared to deny people their voice through their representatives in Parliament to force through a no-deal Brexit"". Shutdown 'a callous political ploy' Welsh Remainers angry at move Others, though, have defended the plan. Former Cabinet Office minster Damian Greentweeted,externalthat there was time to ratify a deal with the EU before 31 October, saying: ""This is all normal Parliamentary democracy, which shows that the talk of coups and dictatorship is massively overblown."" The leader of the DUP, Arlene Foster, also welcomed the decision, but said the terms of her party's agreement with the Conservatives would now be reviewed. On Wednesday evening, protesters gathered in Westminster chanting ""stop the coup"", carrying anti-Brexit placards and EU flags. The demonstration - organised hours beforehand - started outside Parliament before spreading towards Downing Street. This video can not be played Activists rallied across numerous UK cities after PM's plans to suspend parliament Anti-Brexit demonstrators filled Whitehall, near Downing Street Others gathered outside Parliament late into the evening Meanwhile, an e-petition on the government's website demanding Parliament not be suspended reached more than a million signatures in less than a day. A snapYouGov poll,externalconducted on Wednesday suggests 47% of British adults thought the decision was unacceptable, with 27% saying it was acceptable and 27% unsure. But it suggested the suspension was supported by 51% of people who voted Leave, with 52% of Conservative voters also approving of the move. Richard Miles was one of a number of voters in Harborne, Birmingham, who said they supported the prime minister's decision. He told the BBC: ""[MPs] just want to undermine the democratic vote that has already taken place [the referendum]. It's very very dangerous what they're doing."" Three Conservative members of the Queen's Privy Council took the request to suspend Parliament to the monarch's Scottish residence in Balmoral on Wednesday morning on behalf of the prime minister. In full: PM's letter to MPs Pound falls on prorogation announcement It has now been approved, allowing the government to suspend Parliament no earlier than Monday 9 September and no later than Thursday 12 September, until Monday 14 October. Mr Johnson wrote to MPs to outline his plan, calling on Parliament to show ""unity and resolve"" in the run up to 31 October so the government ""stands a chance of securing a new deal"" with the EU. Scotland's top civil court is considering a challengeto the suspension of Parliament, led by the SNP's justice spokeswoman, Joanna Cherry. It is not possible to mount a legal challenge to the Queen's exercise of her personal prerogative powers. Campaigner Gina Miller has made an application to the courts, seeking permission for a judicial review of the PM's decision. She told the BBC the case would question Mr Johnson's advice to the Queen and challenge whether he was using his powers to suspend Parliament and call a Queen's speech legally. Former Prime Minister John Majorhad previously threatened to go to the courts to stop Mr Johnson if he shut down Parliament to deliver a no-deal Brexit. After the announcement, Sir John said he had ""no doubt"" Mr Johnson's motive was to ""bypass a sovereign Parliament that opposes his policy on Brexit"", and he would continue to seek legal advice. However you dress this up, with pinstripe politesse and all the eloquence of the new leader of the House of Commons, welcome to the new reality. There is a band of Brexiteers at the top of government who are committed to sticking to their Brexit deadline whatever it takes - even if it means tearing up conventions that many other people see as valuable. We are going to see others spluttering in their wake: ""They wouldn't dare do that, would they?"" But, oh yes, they would. It is worth saying some of those who are most outraged have been pretty good at bending the rules themselves. But this move by the government does not go without considerable risk - and it hastens the very likely possibility of an election. As one member of the cabinet said to me on Wednesday, everybody knows it is coming, it is just a question of when. But the real question, as ever for the broader Brexit process, is what will be left of our political conventions when one day, eventually, this is all over. This video can not be played What does proroguing Parliament mean? Shutting down Parliament - known as prorogation - happens after the prime minister advises the Queen to do it. BBC royal correspondent Jonny Dymond said it was established precedent to prorogue Parliament before a Queen's Speech. But the suspension is generally shorter and rarely takes place at such a constitutionally charged time. How do you suspend Parliament? Could the Queen have said no? And other questions Parliament is normally suspended - or prorogued - for a short period before a new parliamentary session begins, during which time no debates and votes are held. It is different to ""dissolving"" Parliament, where all MPs give up their seats to campaign in a general election. If this prorogation happens as expected, it will see Parliament closed for 23 working days. MPs cannot block prorogation.

Detectorists find huge Norman conquest coin hoard,"The hoard is the largest Norman treasure find since 1833 A huge hoard of silver coins dating back to the aftermath of the Battle of Hastings could be declared as treasure. The 2,528 silver coins were found in the Chew Valley, north-east Somerset, by a group of metal detectorists. Lisa Grace and Adam Staples, who unearthed the bulk of the hoard, said: ""We've been dreaming of this for 15 years but it's finally come true."" The British Museum said it was the second largest find of Norman coins ever in the UK. Mr Staples, from Derby, added: ""It was totally unbelievable - to find one would be an exceptional day metal detecting. ""To find two unrelated coins would be almost impossible. And when there were more beeps, from two to 10, from 50 to 100, to wow how many are there? ""From then on it was just crazy."" Lisa Grace and Adam Staples, from Derby, found the hoard in January The coins, which date from just after the Battle of Hastings in 1066, depict both the defeated King Harold II and the triumphant William the Conqueror. If the hoard is officially declared as treasure, the Roman Baths in Bath hopes to acquire the coins. Stephen Clews, from the Roman Baths, said: ""If you look at the true value of this, it's about 500 sheep - that's what you would have been to able to buy with them about 1,000 years ago. ""So what we need to do is translate that into some sort of modern value."" The Chew Valley hoard contains 1,236 coins of Harold II, the last crowned Anglo-Saxon king of England, and 1,310 coins of William I, as well as several coin fragments. The hoard was found in the Chew Valley in January Mr Staples, 43, said he and his girlfriend were training five friends to use their metal detectors on a weekend trip when they made the discovery. The first coin, of William the Conqueror, was found by a friend, with the bulk of the hoard found by Mr Staples and his partner. This video can not be played The moment huge Norman coin hoard was found While the coins have not been officially valued, they could be worth about Â£5m which would be shared among the whole group and the landowner, Mr Staples added. Mr Staples said of the dig: ""We didn't leave the site until we thought we'd got all the coins... ""We had a massive thunder and rainstorm. We were all soaking wet by the time we finished."" Under theTreasure Act 1996,external, finders of potential treasure in England, Wales and Northern Ireland are legally obliged to notify their local coroner An inquest then determines whether the finds constitute treasure The act contains a number of definitions of ""treasure"", including prehistoric objects, coins that contain gold or silver and are at least 300 years old, or more recent valuable objects that have been deliberately hidden If the find is declared treasure, the finder must offer it for sale to a museum at a price set by the British Museum's Treasure Valuation Committee A reward is then offered to the finders and other relevant parties Ms Grace, 42, joked: ""It was like the gods didn't want to disturb the hoard... We were wet through but it really didn't seem to matter."" Experts say the ""very well-preserved"" hoard is ""hugely significant"" as it contains double the number of Harold coins than all previous known finds combined. It also includes further examples of coins issued by William I after his coronation on Christmas Day in 1066. Initial studies indicate previously unrecorded mints for both kings' coins in the haul. The William the Conqueror and Harold II coins were found by metal detectorists in Chew Valley Gareth Williams, curator of early medieval coinage at the British Museum, said: ""This is an extremely significant find for our understanding of the impact of the Norman Conquest of 1066. ""One of the big debates amongst historians is the extent to which there was continuity or change, both in the years immediately after the conquest and across a longer period."" Some ""mule"" coins in the hoard have designs from dies of both reigns on either side. Examples of ""mule"" coins which used dies from both reigns were found Experts say this is an early example of tax evasion as the coin maker would re-use an outdated die on one side to avoid paying a fee to obtain the up-to-date design. Senior conservator Pippa Pearce added the coins were ""very well preserved"" due to ""a lucky combination of good quality silver going into ground that contains nothing too corrosive"". Paul Crossley, from Bath and North East Somerset Council, said: ""If we are able to acquire the coins, we will work to display them locally, as well as partnering with the British Museum to make them available for loan to other exhibitions so that they can be seen by a wider audience."" The find has yet to be declared as treasure by the Avon coroner.

Brexit and Parliament: What just happened?,"The House of Commons could sit empty for five weeks if the extended suspension goes through In a dramatic move on Wednesday morning, Britain's new Prime Minister Boris Johnson set in motion the suspension of the UK Parliament - which means MPs have much less time to debate Brexit, the process of the UK leaving the European Union. Parliament is to be suspended for five weeks ahead of 31 October, the day the UK is due to leave the EU. That's just nine weeks away. People who want the UK to remain in the EU are calling it a coup - and even some in favour of Brexit have criticised the move. This video can not be played What does proroguing Parliament mean? Mr Johnson wants to start a new parliamentary session, with a fresh programme, from 14 October. Instead of a normal three-week autumn recess, parliament will now wrap up some time around 10 September. With so little time, MPs would find it difficult to stop the UK leaving the EU without a deal. Parliament always stops work for a few weeks in the autumn. But this isn't a normal recess: Mr Johnson is cutting short the current parliamentary session at a critical time. The UK was originally scheduled to leave the EU on 29 March. After Parliament rejected the deal negotiated with the EU three times, that deadline was extended. Departure day is now 31 October. Mr Johnson, who was one of the key figures in the Leave campaign, has promised to complete Brexit ""do or die"" - with or without a deal. However, most opposition members of Parliament (MPs) and many from the governing Conservative Party don't want to leave the EU without a deal. They fear it would damage the British economy, putting up prices and limiting access to the UK's biggest market. They've threatened to bring legislation ruling out a no-deal Brexit. Failing that, they could also call a vote of no-confidence in the government. Do MPs have the power to stop a no-deal Brexit? Yes. It's what normally happens between the end of one session and the beginning of the next. However, the circumstances are unusual. A legal challenge would be difficult, since the government isn't breaking any law. It's just using parliamentary procedure, as Mr Johnson tries to fulfil his campaign promise to get the UK out of the EU. MPs could either go along with the suspension, with the risk of a no-deal Brexit, or they could trigger an election with a vote of no confidence in the government. The Speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow, has called the suspension a ""constitutional outrage"" designed to prevent MPs from debating Brexit. How do you suspend Parliament? She does have a say, but it's limited. Technically, the government had to ask her for permission to suspend Parliament. This is normally a formality: the Queen keeps out of politics. If she had refused, that would have been unprecedented. She did not refuse. The Queen has always kept herself out of frontline politics Good question. Parliament will go back to work next Tuesday 3 September, but will then go into recess. If Mr Johnson gets his way, Parliament returns on 14 October, two-and-a-half weeks before the UK leaves the EU. However, if MPs pass a vote of no-confidence before 10 September, there could be a general election in October. Please upgrade your browser That depends. If the Conservatives win, then yes. They're ahead in the opinion polls, at about 31% last week, after Mr Johnson took over from the previous Prime Minister, Theresa May, in July. The main opposition Labour Party is trailing by 10 to 12 points, on about 21%. Labour is divided between traditional working-class areas, which tend to support Brexit, and voters in cities like London who are more in favour of remaining in the EU. But a Conservative win is not necessarily in the bag. Other parties, including the centre-left Liberal Democrats and the Scottish Nationalists, are all staunchly opposed to Brexit on any terms. Johnson is putting those MPs opposed to a no-deal Brexit on the spot And then there's the Brexit Party under Nigel Farage, whose central policy is to get the UK out of the EU. The fluid political situation and tight opinion polls make it difficult to say who might get a majority, if anyone. This makes any election difficult to predict. Just ask Mrs May: she called an early election in 2017 but returned with a reduced majority, dependent on 10 MPs from Northern Ireland. As a result, she had to agree to a deal which would keep the UK aligned with EU rules for longer than Brexit supporters would accept. And so here we are. Why are MPs being sent home again?

Advanced ape skull find change human origin ideas,"The discovered skull (R) with an artist's rendering (L) of what Anamensis might have looked like Researchers have discovered a nearly complete 3.8-million-year-old skull of an early ape-like human ancestor in Ethiopia. An analysis of the new specimen challenges ideas about how the first humans evolved from ape-like ancestors. The current view that an ape named Lucy was amonga species that gave rise to the first early humans,externalmay have to be reconsidered. The discovery is reported in thejournal Nature,external. The skull was found by Prof Yohannes Haile-Selassie at a place called Miro Dora, which is in the Mille District of Ethiopia's Afar Regional State. The scientist, who's affiliated to the Cleveland Museum of Natural History in Ohio, US, said he immediately recognised the significance of the fossil. ""I thought to myself, 'oh my goodness - am I seeing what I think I am seeing?'. And all of a sudden I was jumping up and down and that was when I realised that this was what I had dreamt,"" he told BBC News. Fossil finds extend human story,external 'Lucy's baby' found in Ethiopia,external New human-like species discovered Prof Haile-Selassie says the specimen is the best example yet of the ape-like human ancestor calledAustralopithecus anamensis- the oldest known australopithecine whose kind may have existed as far back as 4.2 million years ago. It had been thought thatA.anamensiswas the direct ancestor of a later, more advanced species calledAustralopithecus afarensis,which in turn has been considered a direct ancestor of the first early humans in the grouping, or genus, known asHomo, and which includes all humans alive today. Different aspects of the new specimen's face and view (bottom-left) looking at its upper-jaw from below. The creature had protruding jaws and small earholes The discovery of the firstafarensisskeleton in 1974 caused a sensation. She was nicknamed Lucy by researchers after the Beatles song, Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds, which was playing at the excavation site. Hailed as ""the first ape to have walked"", Lucy captured the public's attention. But writing a commentary in Nature, Prof Fred Spoor, of London's Natural History Museum, said thatanamensis""looks set to become another celebrated icon of human evolution"". The reason for this likely elevated status is because we can now say thatanamensisandafarensisactually overlapped in time. The former did not evolve directly into the latter in a neat linear manner, as previously supposed. The realisation comes about through the reinterpretation that the new fossil brings to bear on a previously discovered 3.9-million-year-old skull fragment. That fragment had been assigned toanamensis.Scientists can now see it is actually the remains of anafarensis,pushing this species' origin deeper into the past. It's apparent now the two species must have co-existed for at least 100,000 years. What most likely happened was that a small group ofanamensisisolated itself from the main population and over time evolved intoafarensisbecause of adaptations to local conditions. The two types rubbed along for a while before the remnantanamensisdied out. The finding is important because it suggests that additional overlaps with other advanced ape-like species may also have occurred, increasing the number of potential evolutionary routes to the first humans. In short, although this latest discovery does not disprove that Lucy's kind gave rise to theHomogroup, it does bring other recently named species into contention. Prof Haile-Selassie agreed that ""all bets are now off"" as to which species is humanity's direct ancestor. He explained: ""For a long time,afarensiswas considered the best candidate as an ancestor to our kind, but we are not in that position any more. Now we can look back at all the species that might have existed at the time and examine which one may have been most like the first human."" The remains of an ape named Lucy thought to be the ancestor of the first humans The term ""missing link"" drives anthropologists crazy when they hear anyone, especially journalists, use it to describe a fossil that is part-ape and part-human. Indeed Dr Henry Gee, a senior editor at Nature, once threatened to ""rip my liver out and eat it with onions, borlotti beans and a glass of claret"" if I did so when reporting a previous discovery. There are many reasons for Henry's irritation, but chief among them is the recognition that there are many links in the chain of human evolution and most if not nearly all of them are still missing. Anamensisis the latest in a string of recent discoveries that shows that there was no smooth line of ascent to modern humans. The truth is far more complex and far more interesting. It tells a story of evolution ""trying out"" different ""prototype"" human ancestors in different places until some of them were resilient and clever enough to withstand the pressures wrought by changes in climate, habitat and food scarcity - and evolve into us. Prof Haile-Selassie is one of the few African scientists working in human evolution. He is now a recognised name but he says it's hard for well qualified African researchers to get the necessary financial backing from Western-based research funding organisations. ""Most of the fossil evidence related to our origin comes from Africa and I think Africans should be able to use the resources available in their own continent and advance their career in palaeoanthropology. Their limitations getting to this field of study is usually funding,"" he told me.

Jessi Combs killed in high-speed crash,"Jessi Combs appeared in a number of television shows US race car driver and television personality Jessi Combs has been killed in a crash while attempting to set a new land speed record. Combs' family confirmed that she had died in a crash in a jet-powered car in south-east Oregon, but further details were not immediately released. In a statement, the family said they remembered her ""bright smile [and] positivity"",external. Combs, 39, had been dubbed the ""fastest woman on four wheels"". This video can not be played Jessi Combs speaking in 2017 about being the first female grand marshal at the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally She earned the title in 2013 when she reached 398 mph (641km/h). Combs was trying to beat that speed and the absolute women's land speed record of 512 mph (824km/h) - set by Kitty O'Neil in 1976 - when she crashed. ""Jessi's most notable dream was to become the fastest woman on Earth, a dream she had been chasing since 2012... and she left this Earth driving faster than any other woman in history,"" her family said.

Born in South Dakota in 1980, Combs developed a love of racing and machinery from a young age with the encouragement of her family. She went to Wyoming's WyoTech college and graduated top of her class with a degree in Custom Automotive Fabrication. The college's marketing department hired her soon afterwards to build a car from scratch for charity, launching her metalworking career. Combs soon began appearing on a number of television shows, serving for a time as co-host of the series Xtreme 4x4, where she showed off her skills building and modifying cars for off-road racing. But her time on the series almost ended in disaster. A piece of machinery fell on her in the studio and fractured her spine, almost paralysing her. She quit the show in 2008 after making a full recovery. Combs went on to appear in numerous other series, including Overhaulin', All Girls Garage and Mythbusters. Former Mythbusters host Adam Savage called her ""a brilliant and top-notch builder, engineer, driver, fabricator, and science communicator"" in a tweet, adding that ""we are lesser for her absence"".

""It's nice that we'll finally be able to have something that fits us, so we can be safe and so we can do the job that we really want to do."" But aside from her metalwork and television careers, Combs was also a prolific competitive racer. She joined the North American Eagle Supersonic Speed Challenger team in 2013, with whom she reached her top speed of 398 mph. She reportedly managed to reach 483 mph in a previous attempt to break her record, although the speed was not officially validated due to a mechanical fault. ""It may seem a little crazy to walk directly into the line of fire... those who are willing, are those who achieve great things. People say I'm crazy.

Parliament to be suspended in September,"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""We're not going to wait until October 31st"" Parliament will be suspended just days after MPs return to work in September - and only a few weeks before the Brexit deadline. Boris Johnson said a Queen's Speech would take place after the suspension, on 14 October, to outline his ""very exciting agenda"". But it means the time MPs have to pass laws to stop a no-deal Brexit on 31 October would be cut. House of Commons Speaker John Bercow said it was a ""constitutional outrage"". The Speaker, who does not traditionally comment on political announcements, continued: ""However it is dressed up, it is blindingly obvious that the purpose of [suspending Parliament] now would be to stop [MPs] debating Brexit and performing its duty in shaping a course for the country."" LIVE: Reaction to government's move Kuenssberg: A decisive and intensely risky step Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson 'close to quitting' How do you suspend Parliament? Brexitcast: We're going to need a bigger klaxon Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: ""Suspending Parliament is not acceptable, it is not on. What the prime minister is doing is a smash and grab on our democracy to force through a no deal,"" he said. He said when MPs return to the Commons next Tuesday, ""the first thing we'll do is attempt legislation to prevent what [the PM] is doing"", followed by a vote of no confidence ""at some point"". This video can not be played Corbyn: ""What is Boris Johnson so afraid of?"" Hundreds of protesters gathered in Westminster on Wednesday evening chanting ""stop the coup"" and carrying anti-Brexit placards and EU flags. The demonstration, which was organised hours beforehand, started outside Parliament before spreading towards Downing Street. At the scene, BBC correspondent Richard Galpin described the atmosphere as peaceful and lively. He said ""good-natured"" protesters on College Green broke through barriers which had been in place to separate live TV crews from members of the public - before traffic on Parliament Square was blocked by some people who sat down in the road. Several protesters he spoke to indicated this was only the beginning of the disruption, with more demonstrations being organised for the weekend. Protesters gathered on College Green in central London Three Conservative members of the Queen's Privy Council took the request to suspend Parliament to the monarch's Scottish residence in Balmoral on Wednesday morning on behalf of the prime minister. It has now been approved, allowing the government to suspend Parliament no earlier than Monday 9 September and no later than Thursday 12 September, until Monday 14 October. Allow Twitter content?

Leader of the House Jacob Rees-Mogg, who was at the meeting with the Queen, said the move was a ""completely proper constitutional procedure."" Earlier, Mr Johnson said suggestions the suspension was motivated by a desire to force through a no deal were ""completely untrue"". He said he did not want to wait until after Brexit ""before getting on with our plans to take this country forward"", and insisted there would still be ""ample time"" for MPs to debate the UK's departure. ""We need new legislation. We've got to be bringing forward new and important bills and that's why we are going to have a Queen's Speech,"" Mr Johnson added. Shutting down Parliament - known as prorogation - happens after the prime minister advises the Queen to do it. The decision to do it now is highly controversial because opponents say it would stop MPs being able to play their full democratic part in the Brexit process. In full: PM's letter to MPs Pound falls on prorogation announcement A number of high profile figures,including former Prime Minister John Major, have threatened to go to the courts to stop it, and a legal challenge led by the SNP's justice spokeswoman, Joanna Cherry,is already working its way through the Scottish courts. After the announcement, Sir John said he had ""no doubt"" Mr Johnson's motive was to ""bypass a sovereign Parliament that opposes his policy on Brexit"", and he would continue to seek legal advice. BBC royal correspondent Jonny Dymond said it was established precedent to prorogue Parliament before a Queen's Speech, albeit generally more briefly, and rarely, if ever, at such a constitutionally charged time. He said it was ""Her Majesty's Government"" in name only and it was her role to take the advice of her ministers, so she would prorogue Parliament if asked to. It is not possible to mount a legal challenge to the Queen's exercise of her personal prerogative powers. But anti-Brexit campaigner Gina Miller -who previously won a legal battle against ministers over Article 50- has made a judicial review application to the courts about Mr Johnson's decision. She told the BBC's Clive Coleman: ""If the intention of using this prorogation - and the effect - is that it limits Parliament sovereignty, then we believe that's illegal and unconstitutional."" This has been an extraordinarily long Parliamentary session, and governments have the right to shut up shop and return to announce their proposals in a new one, with all the golden carriages, fancy Westminster costumes, banging of doors and splendour that goes with it. But that new timetable means Parliament will be suspended for longer than had been expected - it's only a matter of days, but those are days that might matter enormously. Boris Johnson secured his place in No 10 by promising he'd do whatever it takes to leave the EU at Halloween, so this decisive and intensely risky plan will satisfy many of those who backed him. But some others in his government are worried - moving now, even with the accompanying controversy, he sets the stage and the terms for an epic fight with MPs on all sides. Read more from Laura The PM says he wants to leave the EU on 31 October with a deal, but it is ""do or die"" and he is willing to leave without one rather than miss the deadline. That position has prompted a number of opposition MPs to come together to try to block a possible no deal, and on Tuesday they announced that they intended to use parliamentary process to do so. What is a vote of no confidence? What is no deal? And can MPs really stop it? No-deal Brexit opponents agree strategy But with Parliament set to be suspended, opponents have only a few days next week to push for their changes. Senior Tory backbencher and former attorney general Dominic Grieve said the move by Mr Johnson could lead to a vote of no confidence - something opposition parties have left on the table as another option to stop no deal. ""There is plenty of time to do that if necessary [and] I will certainly vote to bring down a Conservative government that persists in a course of action which is so unconstitutional,"" he said. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said MPs must come together to stop the plan next week, or ""today will go down in history as a dark one indeed for UK democracy"". Mr Johnson has written to MPs to outline his plan, adding: ""There will be a significant Brexit legislative programme to get through but that should be no excuse for a lack of ambition!"" He mentioned the NHS, tackling crime, infrastructure investment and the cost of living as important issues. He also called on Parliament to show ""unity and resolve"" in the run up to the 31 October so the government ""stands a chance of securing a new deal"" with the EU. But a senior EU source told the BBC's Brussels correspondent Adam Fleming the bloc's position was clear and was not contingent on the machinations of the UK Parliament. There has been considerable anger at Mr Johnson's move from across the political spectrum. Former Tory Chancellor Philip Hammond called it ""profoundly undemocratic"". Shutdown 'a callous political ploy' Welsh Remainers angry at move The leader of the Liberal Democrats, Jo Swinson, said it was a ""dangerous and unacceptable course of action"". ""He knows the people would not choose a no deal and that elected representatives wouldn't allow it. He is trying to stifle their voices,"" she said. The leader of the SNP in Westminster, Ian Blackford, accused Mr Johnson of ""acting like a dictator"", while First Minister of Wales Mark Drakeford said he wanted to ""close the doors"" on democracy. This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon says Boris Johnson is acting like a ""tin pot dictator"" Others, though, have defended the plan. Conservative Party Chairman James Cleverly said setting out a legislative programme via a Queen's Speech was what ""all new governments do"". US President Donald Trumptweeted his support for Mr Johnson,external, saying it ""would be very hard"" for Mr Corbyn to seek a no-confidence vote against the PM, ""especially in light of the fact that Boris is exactly what the UK has been looking for"". Brexit Party MEP Alex Phillips said MPs ""only had themselves to blame"" for the move. She told BBC News: ""They have made themselves the obstacle in front of delivering the referendum result. Boris Johnson is saying he now needs to remove that obstacle, and quite right too."" The leader of the DUP, Arlene Foster, also welcomed the decision to suspend Parliament and have a Queen's Speech, but said the terms of her party's confidence and supply agreement with the Conservatives would now be reviewed. ""This will be an opportunity to ensure our priorities align with those of the government,"" she added. This video can not be played What does proroguing Parliament mean? Parliament is normally suspended - or prorogued - for a short period before a new session begins. It is done by the Queen, on the advice of the prime minister. Parliamentary sessions normally last a year, but the current one has been going on for more than two years - ever since the June 2017 election. When Parliament is prorogued, no debates and votes are held - and most laws that haven't completed their passage through Parliament die a death. This is different to ""dissolving"" Parliament - where all MPs give up their seats to campaign in a general election. The last two times Parliament was suspended for a Queen's Speech that was not after a general election the closures lasted for four and 13 working days respectively. If this prorogation happens as expected, it will see Parliament closed for 23 working days. MPs have to approve recess dates, but they cannot block prorogation.

She became one of the leading voices in the Remain campaign in the 2016 EU referendum when she repeatedly clashed with Boris Johnson in a TV debate. In the 2017 election Ms Davidson led the Scottish Conservatives to their best result in a Westminster election since 1983. Without her Scottish Tories gaining 12 seats north of the border on 8 June, Theresa May would not have been able to form a government. She did not support Boris Johnson in this year's Conservative leadership race, backing instead Sajid Javid and then Jeremy Hunt. After Mr Johnson won the contest, Ms Davidson said she would ""judge his premiership by his actions in office"". However she has previously made her opposition to a no-deal Brexit clear writing in the Scottish Mail on Sunday that she would not support such a move. BBC Radio 5 Live The SNP's Europe spokesman at Westminster has said he is not surprised to hearRuth Davidson might quitas leader of the Scottish Conservatives. MP Stephen Gethins said: ""We don't know if it's true yet, but if it is I wouldn't be surprised."" ""I think anybody who believes in democracy will think that this is a dark day,"" he told 5 Live. Mr Gethins, whose party opposes a no-deal Brexit, said a prorogation would impact everybody - ""whether you believe in Brexit or not"". Former Chancellor Philip Hammond says the decision by Boris Johnson to suspend Parliament is ""profoundly undemocratic"" at a ""time of national crisis like this"". He says a number of MPs would have preferred to give the PM more time to see if he can get changes to the Brexit deal, before moving to prevent a no-deal in ""late September"". ""That will now not be possible and we will have to try to do something when Parliament returns next week,"" he tells reporters.

BuzzFeed Buzzfeed News reports that senior Downing Street officials have considered a series of ""extreme measures"" to distract parliament and ""force through"" Brexit on Halloween. The website's Alex Wickham says,externalNo 10 has even explored the creation of ""new bank holidays to prevent the House of Commons from being recalled"" during its suspension. âEvery sitting day there is a risk of something going wrong,â a government source told Buzzfeed. BBC News Channel SNP Europe spokesman Stephen Gethins says the request to suspend Parliament means Prime Minister Boris Johnson has ""moved into tinpot dictatorship territory"". He says he sees the move as an attempt to ""force a no-deal Brexit"", for which he says there is ""no mandate"". He adds that ""all sorts of legislation"" needs to be in place for the UK to leave the EU, which would require Parliament to remain open. ""What is clear from this action is that he knows he doesn't have the support in Parliament,"" he adds. Protesters are coming together in response to the prime minister's decision to suspend Parliament. Photos show a crowd of people at Downing Street in central London - including one person dressed as Boris Johnson digging a grave with the headstone ""RIP British Democracy"". Impromptu events organised on social media are also expected to take place in Manchester and Edinburgh this evening. Conservative MP Damian Collins has defended the prime minister's decision to prorogue Parliament, arguing that it ""doesn't mean there can't be a full debate on Brexit"". He accuses opposition politicians of spinning ""political hyperbole"". ""If they want to pass a motion through the House
making a no-deal Brexit possible they can do that as an amendment to the Queenâs
Speech,"" he says. ""Throughout this entire Brexit process the one thing
we have not been short of time on is open-ended parliamentary debate."" Boris Johnsonâs Brexit policy is to âdisembowel Parliamentâ and silence critical voices, the leader of Plaid Cymru says. Adam Price quoted Conservative figures who described the suspension of Parliament as a âconstitutional crisisâ. This video can not be played Plaid Cymru's Adam Price on suspending Parliament The request from ministers to the Queen to prorogue Parliament was made earlier today at a meeting of the Privy Council - a body which meets on average about once a month. The role of this body is usually rather routine, and mostly concerned with obtaining the monarch's formal approval for certain orders approved by ministers. One slightly unusual feature of Privy Council meetings is that they are held with all the participants - including the monarch - standing up. According to the body'sofficial website,external, it is thought that this custom was initiated by Queen Victoria in an effort to reduce her public duties after her husband Prince Albert died. Analysis BBC Radio 5 Live John Pienaar, the BBC's deputy political editor, said today we're seeing Boris Johnson beginning to ""not just win the battle of Brexit, but win the argument that will surround it"". The prime minister said a Queen's Speech would take place after the suspension of Parliament, on 14 October, to outline his ""very exciting agenda"" - and that the announcement was nothing to do with Brexit. ""If you wholly and unquestionably believe that, you will wholly and unquestionably believe anything,"" John Pienaar said on 5 Live. Simon Coveney, the Irish foreign minister, accused Boris Johnson's government of ""wiping the slate clean"" on the Irish backstop issue by opting to prorogue Parliament. Speaking at an event in Paris, he said: ""The disruptive impact of Britain leaving the European Union has a huge impact on the island of Ireland. We have a shared responsiblity with the British government to protect the peace process."" However, he added: ""Iâve always been careful not to get involved in the
parlimentary business of Westminster. They have a sovereign parliament and have
to make difficult decisions and choices.""  Shadow chancellor John McDonnell has
called the move to suspend parliament a ""very British coup"" with the
objective of ""preventing democracy working"". Mr McDonnell accused Boris Johnson of
""imposing a policy"" by preventing ""parliamentary debate and
discussion"". A Very British Coup is the title ofChris Mullin's novelin which a left-wing leader of the Labour Party becomes prime minister and is targeted by a conspiracy between civil servants, MI5, the CIA and the media. Chris Mullin was the Labour MP for Sunderland South from 1987-2010. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""While many, many people may be upset that Parliament is not going to sit at such time, precedent is on the side of those making this decision.

What about Bolivia's fires?,"This armadillo was blinded by fires, its vet said, as the conservation area it lived in burned All eyes have been on the burning of the Amazon rainforest in Brazil, as international pressure - and sharp criticism - have been heaped upon its president. But fires do not stop at borders, and Bolivia's forest is burning too. The Amazon sprawls for millions of square miles across nine different countries - and Bolivia has seen fires rage across the forest near its borders with Brazil and Paraguay. This video can not be played Drone footage shows some of the damage done to Bolivia's Amazon The size of the fires is estimated to have doubled since Thursday. About one million hectares - or more than 3,800 square miles- are affected. Yet while Brazil's President Bolsonaro has been trading rhetorical blows with world leaders over his actions to protect the rainforest, little attention has been given to the blaze in Bolivia and its causes. G7 countries to provide $22m to fight Amazon fires Where there are more fires than the Amazon Amazon fires: Ten of your questions answered A firefighter tackles the blaze in RoborÃ©, near Santa Cruz Bolivian President Evo Morales is in the midst of a controversial re-election campaign, havinggone to the courts to abolish term limits as he seeks a fourth timeas the country's leader. Unlike his Brazilian counterpart, he has decided to accept international help in fighting the fires - securing a Boeing 747 ""supertanker"" from the US to drop water, and welcoming the offer of aid from the G7 summit at the weekend. A volunteer attempts to put out a fire in eastern Bolivia on Sunday Tweeting messages of solidarity and unity, Mr Morales said nothing was more important than Mother Earth - ""she can live without us, but we can't live without her"", and has suspended his election campaign for a week. But critics say this focus on environmentalism is a sudden U-turn, at odds with his record. A supertanker dumps water over RoborÃ© on Friday Under Mr Morales, polices have been changed to allow farmers to clear more land than before by controlled burns - quadrupling the allowance from five to 20 hectares. The decree was only issued last month. Jhanisse Daza, an environmental activist who lives near the area, said she believes the fires may be deliberate policy. ""You have to understand that the use of controlled fires in August when we are going through a dry season is not only negligence,"" she said. ""I believe they knew what they were doing."" ""So there's a policy by the Morales government â although it shows itself internationally as being incredibly environmental and supportive of environmental rights but their policy has been going the complete opposite direction."" Similar accusations are levelled in Brazil, where most of the fires are believed to have been set deliberately by farmers and other small groups who believe they will not face consequences under Bolsonaro's government. This video can not be played Why the Amazon rainforest helps fight climate change Aside from Mr Morales' pro-agriculture razing policy, his government has also been accused of being slow to react when the fires first broke out, and said it would fight the fires itself without the need for foreign aid. Predictably, Evo Morales' rival for the presidency, Carlos Mesa, said the president's efforts had come too late. ""The government reacted late and poorly, it took them almost two weeks and they were without a strategic plan. Evo Morales has put his campaign first rather than governing Bolivia,"" he said. The refusal to accept foreign aid has now been reversed.  Reuters news agency reported that the about-face came after provincial officials and village leaders pleaded with the government to accept the aid. Indigenous leaders have also voiced their criticism. Alex Villca, an indigenous leader in the Amazon region and spokesman for the indigenous rights group Contiocap said that the government was to blame for the fires. ""We need to hold Evo Morales to account for this situation. When is he going to account for all of this? He needs to be held accountable for all the times that the rights of the indigenous people have been violated, as well as those of mother nature,"" he said. Progress is now being made, as some 2,000 firefighters and the military tackle the outbreaks - but much damage has already been done. Why is the Amazon rainforest so important?

Why the pound is getting weaker,"The value of the pound has fallen to a record low against the dollar. It has also fallen against the euro. It comes after the UK government announced large tax cuts, to be paid for by borrowing billions of pounds. The pound's value affects everyone - from shoppers to business owners and investors. This is because when the pound is worth less, the cost of goods imported from overseas goes up. For example: Gas - the price is largely based on the dollar Petrol - oil is priced in dollars, so a weak pound can make filling up your car more expensive Food prices - the UK imports46% of the food,externalit consumes Technology, like mobile phones, or cars made abroad, could get more expensive Even things made in the UK can cost more if parts are bought from other countries. And the pound's value has an impact when you travel abroad. If it buys less of the local currency, then things will be more expensive. Overall, the falling pound could increase thecost of livingby 0.5 percentage points next year, according to Samuel Tombs of research firm Pantheon Economics. What is inflation and why are living costs rising? A weak pound can, however, boost businesses which export to other countries as their goods become cheaper and more attractive to foreign buyers. Investors around the world buy and sell huge amounts of foreign currency. The aim is to profit by buying a currency that goes up in value more than the one sold. The pound plummeted on Friday after the government announced huge tax cuts in its mini-budget. It then plunged again inon Monday, reaching $1.04- the lowest level the pound has ever been against the dollar. The cause is investors selling the pound because they have doubts about the government's plans, said Jane Foley, of Rabobank. ""They're worried that some of these tax cuts that have been announced aren't going to be fully funded,"" she said. These same concerns have also pushed up the cost of government borrowing. The interest on 10-year bonds - which governments sell to investors - has risen from just over 1% in January, to more than 4% now. Some investors believe the government's tax cuts will lead to people spending more, which will push up prices. So in an effort to limit price rises, the Bank would raise interest rates sooner and faster. However, raising rates could leave people with less money, as mortgages and loans become more expensive. ""The markets have decided that [Mr] Kwarteng's tax cuts will lead to higher interest rates and that a deterioration in the public finances will undermine the UK's long-term growth prospects"", said Paul Dales from Capital Economics. The Bank of England isn't set to hold its next interest rate meeting until November, but there is speculation it could act sooner. Ina statement on Twitter,external, the Bank said it was monitoring developments and would ""not hesitate to change interest rates by as much as needed to return inflation to the 2% target"". What the rise in interest rates means for you Where does the government borrow billions from? People travelling to the US at the moment will find their pounds buy fewer dollars The dollar has also performed well against other countries' currencies. Only 24 have outperformed it since the start of the year. However, the pound has fallen more than 20% against the dollar this year, putting it among the 20 worst performing currencies. Among the currencies that have performed worse are the Argentine peso (-27%) and the Turkish lira (-29%). The euro has also fallen against the dollar, by 15% over the same period - the two currencies had the same value this year for the first time in over two decades. The pound is down against the euro over the same period. Compared with India's rupee, the pound is down by 13% since the start of the year. The fall in the pound comes after a surge in the US dollar's value; Part of the reason is down to the US being less exposed to high energy prices caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. As such, the US is considered more of a safe haven for investors. Why is the US dollar so strong? Exchange rates -the rates at which currencies are bought and sold - change constantly. They are affected by lots of things, including: Economy:Successful economies have strong currencies because other countries want to invest there. They need the local currency to do so, pushing up demand and its value Savings:If the Bank of England raises interest rates, holding savings or investments in pounds usually becomes more attractive and increases demand for sterling Prices:If UK goods are cheaper than those abroad, they are attractive to foreign businesses who need sterling to purchase them. This will tend to push up the exchange rate Public finances: The state of a government's bank balance, or how much debt it has, can also affect the exchange rate Speculation:The exchange rate is highly vulnerable to currency speculators, who buy and sell sterling based on expectations of future events What is GDP and how does it affect me?

Home Office's 'misleading' Brexit ad bannedAd watchdog bans government advert telling EU citizens how to stay in the UK after Brexit.UKComments,"A government advert telling EU citizens what they need to do to stay in the UK after Brexit has been banned. In a Home Office radio advert aired in April, listeners were told: ""All you need to apply is your passport or ID card and to complete an online form"". But the Advertising Standards Authority ruled the claim was misleading, as many applicants were required to submit further documents not stated in the ad. The Home Office said: ""We completely disagree with ASA's decision."" The Home Office advert was promoting the government'sEU Settlement Scheme,,externalwhich allows EU citizens and their families to apply to live and work in the UK after freedom of movement ends. Applicants must prove their identity, show that they live in the UK and declare any criminal convictions. What is the EU Settlement Scheme? UK 'risks another Windrush' over EU citizens Brexit: How would no deal affect UK citizens in the EU? In its ruling, advertising watchdog the ASA ruled that the proportion of people asked to submit further documents was higher than what the audience was likely to believe from listening to the ad. ""Listeners would likely understand that an official application process of this nature would always require some applicants to provide further information in exceptional cases,"" the ASA said. ""However, we understood that in 27% of decided adult cases, applicants had been asked to provide documents as evidence of residence. ""Furthermore, some applicants were also asked for other documents, such as evidence of a family relationship."" It added: ""In that context, we considered that the ad did not make sufficiently clear that, in some cases, applicants would need to supply documents beyond their passport or ID card."" In response to the complaint, the Home Office insisted the advert was part of a wider campaign promoting awareness of the EU Settlement Scheme. The Home Office said its website page about the scheme had seen more than five million page views It told the ASA it was not possible to include all aspects of the application process in a short ad, and listeners were directed to the scheme's website where there was more detailed information. It argued that - regardless of the application outcome - in 73% of cases people did not have to submit any more documents as evidence of their residence. The ASA rejected the government's defence and ruled the advert must not be broadcast again in the same format. It also told the Home Office that, in future, adverts must make clear that applicants may need to provide additional documents. Responding to the ruling, the Home Office told the BBC: ""The campaign was factual and complied with all necessary clearance processes for radio advertising. ""The campaign has had a positive impact and encouraged more than one million successful applications so far."" There are an estimated 3.3 million EU citizens living in the UK - meaning more than two million people have either not registered for the scheme or not been successful. The Home Office says it spent Â£3.75m on a marketing campaign to encourage EU citizens to apply early for the EU Settlement Scheme. In May,MPs warned that government risked another Windrush scandal if ""serious concerns"" about the scheme were not addressed. The Commons Home Affairs Committee said the scheme had been ""blighted"" by technical issues and some people were struggling to navigate the online application system. The scheme has been open to EU, EEA and Swiss citizens since March of this year, with applications currently having to be made by 31 December 2020 if the UK leaves without a deal, and 30 June 2021 if it leaves with a deal. Anyone granted settled status will be entitled to the same work, healthcare, housing and education rights after Britain leaves the EU as they do now.

Festival-goers 'should pay Â£25 tent tax'Campaigners want to see campers charged a pitch deposit to stop tents being abandoned on festival sites.UK,"Festival-goers should be charged a Â£25 deposit to camp at Reading and Leeds, say campaigners who want to stop so many tents being abandoned every year. After the Bank Holiday festivals, photos emerged showing fields strewn with litter, nearly-new tents, airbeds and even an upright gazebo. Clean Up Britain is now proposing campers pay a deposit which is returned only if they take their tent home. Reading and Leeds organisers were unavailable for comment. The average tent is mostly made of plastic - the equivalent of 8,750 straws or 250 pint cups, according to the Association of Independent Festivals. But festival-goers often find themselves too tired and emotional after a weekend partying to take the time and effort to pack up their belongings - and their tent. What happens to the tents left at Leeds Festival- - BBC News Calls for shops to stop marketing 'festival tents' Festival revellers bask in record temperatures John Read, founder of campaign group Clean Up Britain, told the BBC: ""This is heartbreaking and such a waste of resources - it should not happen. ""You see a lot of people saying they care about the environment but their words and actions don't match up."" He described it as a ""glorified form of flytipping"", as people were just leaving the mess for someone else to clean up. He believes a pitch deposit - or ""tent tax"" - would be a good financial incentive to take tents home - and is keen to speak to festival organisers about introducing his idea. He said his group thought it should be fixed at Â£25 - but others have told him it needed to be higher. Any money made could go into redistributing abandoned tents to homeless charities, scout groups and local community groups, he said. Mr Read is also calling on Reading and Leeds festival organisers to do more to disseminate an environmental message about littering and waste in general. Festival organisers need to do more to get across the environmental message, say campaigners It is not known how many tents - many of them virtually brand new - were left behind at the festivals this year. Charity group, Festival Waste Reclamation and Distribution, which collects unwanted equipment from festivals across the UK, says thousands of tents are abandoned every year, many of them ending up in landfill. Its volunteers are allowed onto sites to salvage sleeping bags, roll mats, tents, clothes, waterproofs and blankets, once everyone has left. These are then given to the most vulnerable in society, including Syrian refugees.

Brexit and suspending parliament: What just happened?,"The House of Commons could sit empty for five weeks if the extended suspension goes through In a dramatic move on Wednesday morning, Britain's new Prime Minister Boris Johnson set in motion the suspension of the UK Parliament - which means MPs have much less time to debate Brexit, the process of the UK leaving the European Union. Parliament is to be suspended for five weeks ahead of 31 October, the day the UK is due to leave the EU. That's just nine weeks away. People who want the UK to remain in the EU are calling it a coup - and even some in favour of Brexit have criticised the move. This video can not be played What does proroguing Parliament mean? Mr Johnson wants to start a new parliamentary session, with a fresh programme, from 14 October. Instead of a normal three-week autumn recess, parliament will now wrap up some time around 10 September. With so little time, MPs would find it difficult to stop the UK leaving the EU without a deal. Parliament always stops work for a few weeks in the autumn. But this isn't a normal recess: Mr Johnson is cutting short the current parliamentary session at a critical time. The UK was originally scheduled to leave the EU on 29 March. After Parliament rejected the deal negotiated with the EU three times, that deadline was extended. Departure day is now 31 October. Mr Johnson, who was one of the key figures in the Leave campaign, has promised to complete Brexit ""do or die"" - with or without a deal. However, most opposition members of Parliament (MPs) and many from the governing Conservative Party don't want to leave the EU without a deal. They fear it would damage the British economy, putting up prices and limiting access to the UK's biggest market. They've threatened to bring legislation ruling out a no-deal Brexit. Failing that, they could also call a vote of no-confidence in the government. Do MPs have the power to stop a no-deal Brexit? Yes. It's what normally happens between the end of one session and the beginning of the next. However, the circumstances are unusual. A legal challenge would be difficult, since the government isn't breaking any law. It's just using parliamentary procedure, as Mr Johnson tries to fulfil his campaign promise to get the UK out of the EU. MPs could either go along with the suspension, with the risk of a no-deal Brexit, or they could trigger an election with a vote of no confidence in the government. The Speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow, has called the suspension a ""constitutional outrage"" designed to prevent MPs from debating Brexit. How do you suspend Parliament? She does have a say, but it's limited. Technically, the government had to ask her for permission to suspend Parliament. This is normally a formality: the Queen keeps out of politics. If she had refused, that would have been unprecedented. She did not refuse. The Queen has always kept herself out of frontline politics Good question. Parliament will go back to work next Tuesday 3 September, but will then go into recess. If Mr Johnson gets his way, Parliament returns on 14 October, two-and-a-half weeks before the UK leaves the EU. However, if MPs pass a vote of no-confidence before 10 September, there could be a general election in October. Please upgrade your browser That depends. If the Conservatives win, then yes. They're ahead in the opinion polls, at about 31% last week, after Mr Johnson took over from the previous Prime Minister, Theresa May, in July. The main opposition Labour Party is trailing by 10 to 12 points, on about 21%. Labour is divided between traditional working-class areas, which tend to support Brexit, and voters in cities like London who are more in favour of remaining in the EU. But a Conservative win is not necessarily in the bag. Other parties, including the centre-left Liberal Democrats and the Scottish Nationalists, are all staunchly opposed to Brexit on any terms. Johnson is putting those MPs opposed to a no-deal Brexit on the spot And then there's the Brexit Party under Nigel Farage, whose central policy is to get the UK out of the EU. The fluid political situation and tight opinion polls make it difficult to say who might get a majority, if anyone. This makes any election difficult to predict. Just ask Mrs May: she called an early election in 2017 but returned with a reduced majority, dependent on 10 MPs from Northern Ireland. As a result, she had to agree to a deal which would keep the UK aligned with EU rules for longer than Brexit supporters would accept. And so here we are. Why are MPs being sent home again?

Pound falls on suspension news,"The pound was volatile on Wednesday following news that Parliament is to be suspended just days after MPs return to work on 3 September. The moveis expected to prevent opposition leadersfrom passing a law to stop a no-deal Brexit. The pound is down about 0.5% against both the euro and US dollar. So Â£1 is now worth â¬1.10 and $1.22. The FTSE 100, made up of stocks that could benefit from a devaluation of sterling, ended 0.4% ahead to 7,114.71. Many of those listed firms book much of their earnings in foreign currencies, and benefit from a weak pound. The FTSE 250, a stock index that is seen as more representative of the UK economy, closed down 0.7% to 19,202.99. Firms that are exposed to the domestic economy such as house builders and airlines were hit: Taylor Wimpey, Persimmon and Barratt Developments were down between 2% and 2.3%. Meanwhile, British Airways owner IAG fell 1.7% and easyJet dropped 3.2%. Why is the pound is getting weaker? Government asks Queen to suspend Parliament ""As far as the markets are concerned, there's a fair bit of bad news already baked in to the pound,"" according to David Cheetham, an analyst at currency trader XTB Online Trading. ""It is telling that after the knee-jerk move lower in recent trade, the selling we've seen is far from panic stations."" Discussing the prime minister's decision to suspend parliament, Mr Cheetham said: ""This seems like a pre-emptive strike from [Mr Johnson] against those seeking to block a no-deal Brexit and once more it seems that the opposition are in danger of fluffing a big opportunity to have an impact. ""If the government is successful in this, then a no-deal Brexit wouldn't be taken off the table until the 11th hour at the earliest and this keeps a significant downside risk to the pound in play."" And Michael Hewson, chief markets analyst at CMC, said: ""Sterling is under pressure as a consequence of the prospect of a no-deal Brexit increasing, while the FTSE 100 has jumped higher. ""Overall, though, this appears part and parcel of the ongoing battle between the various caucuses of MPs who want to block a no-deal Brexit at all costs, and those who want to retain the option as part of the ongoing attempts to renegotiate the withdrawal agreement."" The government has asked the Queen to suspend Parliament just days after MPs return to work in September - and only a few weeks before the Brexit deadline. Boris Johnson said a Queen's Speech would take place after the suspension, on 14 October, to outline his ""very exciting agenda"". But it means MPs are unlikely to have time to pass laws to stop a no-deal Brexit on 31 October. Queen approves Parliament suspension Can no-deal Brexit be stopped? Why are MPs being sent home again?

"Bury's heart 'ripped out', says Neville","This video can not be played Bury's expulsion is disgraceful - Neville England women's manager Phil Neville says the heart of Bury has been ""ripped out"" by their expulsion from the English Football League. The League One club lost their place in the EFL on Tuesday when a takeover by C&N Sporting Risk fell through. Bury-born Neville's mother Jill last week resigned as club secretary, while his late father Neville was a director. ""I'm devastated,"" said Neville. ""It's disgraceful. Bury, after 125 years, no longer has a football club."" He added: ""I find it difficult. I dread to think how my mum's feeling. ""I've obviously been living it as my mum's been secretary for 31 years. She resigned last week but still worked every hour that God sent to do the right thing for the football club. ""The heart of the town has been ripped apart. Now it's up to the Bury people - myself included - to try to put some heart back into a town that relied heavily on a football club."" Bury expelled from English Football League How Bury went from promotion to expulsion Bury expulsion a tragedy - Sports Minister Nigel Adams 'Football teams are our collective history' The businessmen who pulled out of a plan to take over Bury said they could not overcome the financial problems the club was facing. With the Shakers now expelled from the EFL, they will not be able to play again until next season at the earliest - and then it will be at a non-league level. Neville's siblings, former England defender Gary and ex-England netball coach Tracey, have both responded to criticism from supporters via social media that they did not step in to help the club. This video can not be played Fans say Bury is a 'club, not a team' and a place to escape to 'something different' Both Gary and Phil are part-owners of League Two side Salford City, meaning they were unable to offer any financial support under Football Association rules. ""It's ripped the heart out of our town, out of our club and out of my mum and the family,"" added Phil. ""There's a stand named after my dad who worked for the club for 26 years - my nanna, my grandad, my auntie, my uncle all worked behind the scenes and me and my brother supported the club. ""Every town needs a football club. It's emotional for me. My mum's given her heart and soul to that club, my dad  - it nearly killed him at one point. ""It's difficult because I'm part-owner of another football club so we couldn't do anything about it. It doesn't mean you don't care. It's like a death in the town of Bury.

"Stop 'misleading' special offers, supermarkets told","Supermarkets are still offering misleading special offers and discounts despite rules designed to stop this, according to Which? The consumer group found ""dubious"" deals that were worse than they first appeared at most major UK chains. These included multi-buys that cost more despite the alleged offer, and special offers in which goods are sold at the special price most of the year. Supermarkets were trying to cut costs for shoppers, a retailers' group said. Which? looked at pricing data from May 2018 to June 2019 for 459 products. These spanned seven of the UK's biggest supermarkets: Asda, Iceland, Morrisons, Ocado, Sainsbury's, Tesco and Waitrose. Tesco raises prices on 1,000 products Reality Check: Do UK supermarkets vary prices by area? Among the ""dodgy"" deals it came across was an Iceland multi-buy, where customers were offered two packets of Kellogg's Crunchy Nut cornflakes for Â£4, or Â£2 each. While this appeared to offer a saving, Which? found that the price was just Â£1.49 per packet a week earlier - 51p less per item. It also found a promotion at Asda for Wall's Carte D'Or Strawberry Ice Cream (1L) that read, ""was Â£3.50 now Â£2"". However, Which? said the product retailed at Â£2 for around eight months of the year, with the special offer only lasting about a third of that time. A previous Which? investigation into misleading pricing in 2015,externalled the government to roll out new guidance to ensure retailers' pricing practices complied with consumer law. The rules state that retailers must ensure the information they present to consumers is fair and does not waste time or cause annoyance, disappointment or regret. Neither should it cause a consumer to overspend or buy a product that is inappropriate for them. But Natalie Hitchins, head of home products and services at Which?, said: ""Four years on... many of the big supermarkets are clearly still in the wrong, with numerous examples of dodgy discounts and never-ending offers. ""These retailers must stop tricking shoppers with deceptive deals... if not, the CMA must intervene to ensure that pricing guidelines are followed."" She said that the magazine would report its latest findings to the Consumer and Markets Authority (CMA). Iceland said it would review its promotional calendar following Which?'s findings, but Asda rejected claims its offers were misleading. The other supermarkets did not respond to requests for comment. Meanwhile, industry body the British Retail Consortium said: ""Supermarkets seek to provide the best value for consumers on the hundreds of thousands of product lines they sell. ""This is often through promotions and discounts, which can change week to week, even on the same product lines, as retailers seek to cut the cost for shoppers.""

Bury expulsion 'dark day' for football,"Bury fans finally learned that their club would be expelled from the league late on Tuesday evening Bury's expulsion from the English Football League is a ""tragedy"", says Sports Minister Nigel Adams. The financially stricken League One club lost their place in the EFL late on Tuesday night after a proposed takeover by C&N Sporting Risk fell through earlier in the day. ""This is a very dark day for English football,"" Adams said in a statement. ""It is a tragedy for the fans of Bury, the local community and everyone connected with the historic club."" Bury's heart 'ripped out' by expulsion - Neville Bury expelled from English Football League Reaction as Bury are expelled and Bolton get 14 days to find new owners He added: ""There will be a huge amount of anger and disbelief about how this happened. ""I have been in regular contact with the EFL and it is right that they closely review the processes at Bury to see if any lessons can be learned. ""The club's passionate fans don't deserve to go through this. I hope once the dust has settled they can begin to rebuild and take inspiration from other clubs that have done so before them."" Bury supporters have directed their anger at owner Steve Dale, who bought the club in December 2018 The Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee will meet in Parliament next week to discuss the situations at Bury and Bolton, who are stilltrying to conclude a takeover dealof their own. The committee's chairman Damian Collins says there must be changes to the way clubs are regulated, suggesting the Football Association should be given a legal responsibility to safeguard clubs. ""The role of the [English] Football League when things go wrong at clubs like Bury and Bolton is largely to just manage the process of decline, rather than to actually actively step in at an earlier stage when the club could be saved and turned around,"" he told BBC Radio 5 Live. ""Their main concern at the moment is not about saving Bury Football Club, it is about protecting the integrity of the competition, so they don't want clubs dropping out of the league during the season. ""It is totally understandable that is their prerogative, but I think fans deserve to know that - as is in other industries, such as the media for example - there are regulators that can step in and say 'we don't feel the management of this club is fit for purpose and, therefore, we are going to do something about it and save it'. ""I think what they [the FA] need is a legal power, just as Ofcom [the media regulator] have. They have a legal power over any company that holds a broadcasting licence, where they can step in and say 'we don't feel you are meeting your obligations and, therefore, we could remove your licence and give it to somebody else'. ""So they could save the club and take it out of the hands of a bad owner."" Bury won promotion from League Two last season despite their players going a number of months without being paid Bury's expulsion follows success on the pitch last season when they finished second in League Two and won promotion back to the third tier, having been relegated in 2018. Former FA chairman Greg Dyke says Bury's problems stemmed from chasing promotion without the finances to pay for it. ""Over the years some quite strange people have taken over and run football clubs and they don't necessarily know how to run them,"" he told BBC Radio 5 Live. ""The real issue is most football clubs at the lower levels are paying too much for the players. What is remarkable is that this doesn't happen more often. ""In the end if you're paying so much to buy players or for their wages and you're not getting that sort of money in, it's not a business at all is it? ""Whether the Football League has got the nerve to bring in wage caps and all those sorts of things will be interesting."" The businessmen who pulled out of a plan to take over Bury say they could not overcome the financial problems the club was facing. C&N Sporting Risk's bid was the only one the EFL would consider, despite reports of other potential buyers coming in around the 17:00 BST deadline on Tuesday, ""We were just going to face challenges that were insurmountable to allow us to do what we wanted to do if we took over the club,"" C&N's Rory Campbell told BBC Radio 5 Live. But C&N said the club's complicated financial structures were too difficult for it to sort out before the deadline passed. ""We did absolutely everything we could to try and get everything in place to try and make sure the takeover went through,"" added Campbell's colleague Henry Newman. ""Ultimately though, it was six years of a combination of financial mismanagement, errors in governance and issues that ultimately meant that to unravel them, in what was a short period of time, were incredibly difficult."" While neither Campbell nor Newman would go into specifics about the finances of the club, Bury had complicated leasing arrangements for their Gigg Lane ground, car parks and had a number of outstanding loans. ""The financial structures that were put in place were something that I'd never seen before and certainly were unsustainable,"" Newman added. ""My sympathy really does go out to the community as a whole at Bury because ultimately they're the ones that have suffered as a result of this. ""It was financially unsustainable and it's absolutely imperative that structures are put in place to ensure that something like this can't happen again."" This video can not be played Fans say Bury is a 'club, not a team' and a place to escape to 'something different' The focus now turns to what next for Bury. With the club expelled from the EFL, they will not be able to play again until next season at the earliest, and then it will be at a non-league level. The Football Association have also confirmed that Bury will ""no longer be able to participate"" in this season's FA Cup following Tuesday's events. The FA added: ""If the club re-forms, we look forward to them applying to make an application to The Football Association to rejoin league competition further down the English football pyramid from the 2020-21 season."" ""We have got a meeting this morning to look at our next move. What we would like to do is try and save this football club,"" Dave Giffard, chair of Forever Bury Supporters Club, told BBC Breakfast. ""If we have to restart as a phoenix club we would like to get hold of this ground. We have the support of the council."" Giffard was also critical of the EFL, which expelled the club despite reports of late bids for Bury coming in on Tuesday. ""The annoying thing is we had three more buyers there and the League wanted exclusivity with the one deal to concentrate on getting that through,"" he said. ""So we threw the other three in on the table last night. The proof of funding was there. Why they couldn't give us that little bit more time to get one over the line, we don't know."" The Professional Footballers' Association, which has stepped in to help pay some of the players' wages in recent months, said it will ""continue to support all of our members who have been impacted by the current situation, including former players, the remaining players who are contracted at the club and also those who were hoping to sign contracts"". Their statement added: ""Our thoughts in particular go out to the supporters, the town and the wider community who will be devastated by this news.""

Is this Scotland's steepest street?,"This video can not be played Taking a stroll on 'Scotland's steepest street' A street in north Wales has been confirmed as the steepest in the world with a lung-busting gradient of 37.45% - but how do Scotland's streets measure up? After asking our readers to nominate the toughest climbs they have encountered, we enlisted the help of Ordnance Survey to crown a winner from the 15 most popular suggestions. Middle Brae is so steep that one local drew up plans for a ski lift that would carry weary pedestrians to the top Regularly listed among the most beautiful towns in Scotland, Tobermory on the Isle of Mull is probably best known for its brightly painted waterfront houses that featured in the Cbeebies programme Balamory - and also has the enviable accolade of having a Womble named after it. The seaside town now has another claim to fame after Ordnance Survey confirmed that Middle Brae - also known as Post Office Brae - has topped our list with a gradient of 19.4%. The street is one of several sharp inclines that run up the hill behind the picturesque harbour area, and inspired one enterprising local to draw up plans for a ski lift to carry pedestrians to the top. Gaelic teacher Kirsten McDonald told BBC Scotland that the deceptive hilliness of Tobermory often comes as a shock to tourists, but helps to keep locals fit. She said: ""People are used to seeing pretty houses on the main street but are not aware we've got these really steep hills elsewhere. ""People are quite proud of them, seeing all the tourists struggling up them while they're able to quickly overtake them."" The brightly painted seafront makes Tobermory one of the most beautiful towns in Scotland Argyll and Bute councillor Mary-Jean Devon, who lives in the town, added: ""Maybe 30 or 40 years ago there was a retired gentleman in the village, an architect, who designed a contraption similar to a ski lift for Post Office Brae. Sadly it never came to anything. ""People say you get used to climbing these hills, but you don't. You still kid on you're a tourist half way up, turn around and look at the view."" With its twisting cobbled ascents and towering staircases, the street named as the second steepest on our shortlist sits on the Mound, a man-made hill in the centre of Edinburgh. It was formed between 1781 and 1830 by dumping about a million and a half cartloads of earth and rubble excavated from the foundations of the city's New Town into the drained Nor Loch, and originally acted as a muddy bridge between the Old and New Towns. The Mound is now home to some of the capital's most famous buildings, including the National Gallery of Scotland and the headquarters of the Bank of Scotland. Welsh street confirmed as steepest in the world Is this England's steepest street? The detritus also eventually created Ramsay Lane, which boasts a gradient of 15.73% and has one of the city's oldest visitor attractions - the Camera Obscura - at the very top. One reader told us: ""I have to walk up this every day and it's brutally steep. Leaves me dripping like a knackered fridge."" The daunting view down Ellwyn Crescent Some 33 miles south of Scotland's capital lies a sweeping road in the outskirts of Galashiels which ranks third in our list of contenders. The area is famed for its annual Braw Lads Gathering - a traditional event which sees locals parade across the town on horseback. Even the Braw Lads shy away from Ellwyn Crescent Mercifully for their horses, the Braw Lads leave Ellwyn Crescent - with its 15.62% gradient - off their route. But anyone who dares to brave the unforgiving incline will be rewarded with a stunning bird's-eye view of the town and the region's picturesque braes. Jedburgh's position near the border between Scotland and England placed it in the centre of many a battle and cross-border raid until the 17th Century, although the town's fraught history has been replaced by idyllic water walks and markets. Just behind the ruins of Jedburgh Abbey lies Lanton Road and its 15.46% gradient, which offers views over the entire town before joining Tudhope Loaning. Visitors including Robert Burns and Lord Byron have flocked to Banff in Aberdeenshire for centuries, drawn by its seven-arch bridge, architecture and harbour. Nowadays tourists often come for the golf - but any who venture into the town centre can find themselves facing one of the toughest climbs in Scotland. Sealed off to traffic, Strait Path's 13.91% gradient will leave many out of puff before they make it to the top, despite the hand rails that have helpfully been installed along the street to aid weary pedestrians. The thoughtful townsfolk of Banff have installed a handrail along the length of Strait Path Jeweller Grant Lawrence has worked on the street for about 20 years and says the path has actually been useful for business. He said: ""What we've got here is a pedestrian street so there's always people walking up and down. I'm at the top of the path and you get folk coming in saying 'that brae is a bit steep!' ""People tend to walk up the hill, stop, have a rest and have a look in the shop window so I suppose it helps."" Gardner Street in Glasgow was the most popular suggestion in our survey. Please apply your handbrake after parking. Gardner Street in Glasgow - just off Dumbarton Road in Partick - was the street that was nominated by the largest number of readers as the steepest they had encountered, with the city centre's Douglas Street and North Portland Street at Strathclyde University also among the suggestions. During snowy winters Gardner Street becomes a sledging playground and has even been known to attract the odd snowboarder, while the Glasgow Warriors rugby team once used it as part of their strength and conditioning training.

Perhaps unexpectedly, the street's gradient was measured at just 8.03% which made it only the 13th steepest of the 15 streets we asked Ordnance Survey to look at. Whinny Brae in Broughty Ferry was the second most common suggestion. The thigh-burning top section of the street has been sealed off to traffic for the past 50 years, yet the gradient of the slope overall was 10.68%. The top section of Whinny Brae has been sealed off to traffic for decades This story was inspired byhundreds of nominations from BBC News Online readers. We asked Ordnance Survey to work out the steepest gradients for the top 15 most frequently suggested streets, but did not include routes such as the road to Applecross, which is not a named street. Ben Humphries of Ordnance Survey said: ""We took the extents and alignments of each street from our MasterMap data. ""A few of the streets existed as more than one line segment in the data - reflecting that there are posts or bollards splitting them up on the ground - so these had to be connected up to make a single line for each street."" He added: ""These were overlaid onto terrain data to give elevation values. ""The lines of the streets were broken down into five-metre sections, and the elevations recorded for each section. The difference between the minimum and maximum height gives the elevation range for each street: dividing this by the street's length gives a gradient percentage for the full extent of the street."" Thanks to everyone who sent in their suggestions. The full results for the 15 most popular were: Middle Brae, Tobermory    19.40% Ramsay Lane, Edinburgh    15.73% Ellwyn Crescent, Galashiels    15.62% Lanton Road, Jedburgh    15.46% Strait Path, Banff                   13.91% School Brae, Bo'ness    12.92% Justice Mill Brae, Aberdeen    11.98% Wardlaw Drive, Rutherglen    11.43% Whinny Brae, Broughty Ferry  10.68% Mount Zion Brae, Arbroath    10.63% Castle View, Castle Douglas     8.90% Bouverie Street, Port Glasgow  8.49% Gardner Street, Glasgow      8.03% Mary Street, Stonehaven      7.85% Victoria Road, Gourock      4.56% The steepest street party in the world.

Government asks Queen to suspend ParliamentThe controversial move means MPs are unlikely to have time to pass any laws that could stop a no-deal Brexit.,"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""We're not going to wait until October 31st"" Parliament will be suspended just days after MPs return to work in September - and only a few weeks before the Brexit deadline. Boris Johnson said a Queen's Speech would take place after the suspension, on 14 October, to outline his ""very exciting agenda"". But it means the time MPs have to pass laws to stop a no-deal Brexit on 31 October would be cut. House of Commons Speaker John Bercow said it was a ""constitutional outrage"". The Speaker, who does not traditionally comment on political announcements, continued: ""However it is dressed up, it is blindingly obvious that the purpose of [suspending Parliament] now would be to stop [MPs] debating Brexit and performing its duty in shaping a course for the country."" LIVE: Reaction to government's move Kuenssberg: A decisive and intensely risky step Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson 'close to quitting' How do you suspend Parliament? Brexitcast: We're going to need a bigger klaxon Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: ""Suspending Parliament is not acceptable, it is not on. What the prime minister is doing is a smash and grab on our democracy to force through a no deal,"" he said. He said when MPs return to the Commons next Tuesday, ""the first thing we'll do is attempt legislation to prevent what [the PM] is doing"", followed by a vote of no confidence ""at some point"". This video can not be played Corbyn: ""What is Boris Johnson so afraid of?"" Hundreds of protesters gathered in Westminster on Wednesday evening chanting ""stop the coup"" and carrying anti-Brexit placards and EU flags. The demonstration, which was organised hours beforehand, started outside Parliament before spreading towards Downing Street. At the scene, BBC correspondent Richard Galpin described the atmosphere as peaceful and lively. He said ""good-natured"" protesters on College Green broke through barriers which had been in place to separate live TV crews from members of the public - before traffic on Parliament Square was blocked by some people who sat down in the road. Several protesters he spoke to indicated this was only the beginning of the disruption, with more demonstrations being organised for the weekend. Protesters gathered on College Green in central London Three Conservative members of the Queen's Privy Council took the request to suspend Parliament to the monarch's Scottish residence in Balmoral on Wednesday morning on behalf of the prime minister. It has now been approved, allowing the government to suspend Parliament no earlier than Monday 9 September and no later than Thursday 12 September, until Monday 14 October. Allow Twitter content?

Leader of the House Jacob Rees-Mogg, who was at the meeting with the Queen, said the move was a ""completely proper constitutional procedure."" Earlier, Mr Johnson said suggestions the suspension was motivated by a desire to force through a no deal were ""completely untrue"". He said he did not want to wait until after Brexit ""before getting on with our plans to take this country forward"", and insisted there would still be ""ample time"" for MPs to debate the UK's departure. ""We need new legislation. We've got to be bringing forward new and important bills and that's why we are going to have a Queen's Speech,"" Mr Johnson added. Shutting down Parliament - known as prorogation - happens after the prime minister advises the Queen to do it. The decision to do it now is highly controversial because opponents say it would stop MPs being able to play their full democratic part in the Brexit process. In full: PM's letter to MPs Pound falls on prorogation announcement A number of high profile figures,including former Prime Minister John Major, have threatened to go to the courts to stop it, and a legal challenge led by the SNP's justice spokeswoman, Joanna Cherry,is already working its way through the Scottish courts. After the announcement, Sir John said he had ""no doubt"" Mr Johnson's motive was to ""bypass a sovereign Parliament that opposes his policy on Brexit"", and he would continue to seek legal advice. BBC royal correspondent Jonny Dymond said it was established precedent to prorogue Parliament before a Queen's Speech, albeit generally more briefly, and rarely, if ever, at such a constitutionally charged time. He said it was ""Her Majesty's Government"" in name only and it was her role to take the advice of her ministers, so she would prorogue Parliament if asked to. It is not possible to mount a legal challenge to the Queen's exercise of her personal prerogative powers. But anti-Brexit campaigner Gina Miller -who previously won a legal battle against ministers over Article 50- has made a judicial review application to the courts about Mr Johnson's decision. She told the BBC's Clive Coleman: ""If the intention of using this prorogation - and the effect - is that it limits Parliament sovereignty, then we believe that's illegal and unconstitutional."" This has been an extraordinarily long Parliamentary session, and governments have the right to shut up shop and return to announce their proposals in a new one, with all the golden carriages, fancy Westminster costumes, banging of doors and splendour that goes with it. But that new timetable means Parliament will be suspended for longer than had been expected - it's only a matter of days, but those are days that might matter enormously. Boris Johnson secured his place in No 10 by promising he'd do whatever it takes to leave the EU at Halloween, so this decisive and intensely risky plan will satisfy many of those who backed him. But some others in his government are worried - moving now, even with the accompanying controversy, he sets the stage and the terms for an epic fight with MPs on all sides. Read more from Laura The PM says he wants to leave the EU on 31 October with a deal, but it is ""do or die"" and he is willing to leave without one rather than miss the deadline. That position has prompted a number of opposition MPs to come together to try to block a possible no deal, and on Tuesday they announced that they intended to use parliamentary process to do so. What is a vote of no confidence? What is no deal? And can MPs really stop it? No-deal Brexit opponents agree strategy But with Parliament set to be suspended, opponents have only a few days next week to push for their changes. Senior Tory backbencher and former attorney general Dominic Grieve said the move by Mr Johnson could lead to a vote of no confidence - something opposition parties have left on the table as another option to stop no deal. ""There is plenty of time to do that if necessary [and] I will certainly vote to bring down a Conservative government that persists in a course of action which is so unconstitutional,"" he said. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said MPs must come together to stop the plan next week, or ""today will go down in history as a dark one indeed for UK democracy"". Mr Johnson has written to MPs to outline his plan, adding: ""There will be a significant Brexit legislative programme to get through but that should be no excuse for a lack of ambition!"" He mentioned the NHS, tackling crime, infrastructure investment and the cost of living as important issues. He also called on Parliament to show ""unity and resolve"" in the run up to the 31 October so the government ""stands a chance of securing a new deal"" with the EU. But a senior EU source told the BBC's Brussels correspondent Adam Fleming the bloc's position was clear and was not contingent on the machinations of the UK Parliament. There has been considerable anger at Mr Johnson's move from across the political spectrum. Former Tory Chancellor Philip Hammond called it ""profoundly undemocratic"". Shutdown 'a callous political ploy' Welsh Remainers angry at move The leader of the Liberal Democrats, Jo Swinson, said it was a ""dangerous and unacceptable course of action"". ""He knows the people would not choose a no deal and that elected representatives wouldn't allow it. He is trying to stifle their voices,"" she said. The leader of the SNP in Westminster, Ian Blackford, accused Mr Johnson of ""acting like a dictator"", while First Minister of Wales Mark Drakeford said he wanted to ""close the doors"" on democracy. This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon says Boris Johnson is acting like a ""tin pot dictator"" Others, though, have defended the plan. Conservative Party Chairman James Cleverly said setting out a legislative programme via a Queen's Speech was what ""all new governments do"". US President Donald Trumptweeted his support for Mr Johnson,external, saying it ""would be very hard"" for Mr Corbyn to seek a no-confidence vote against the PM, ""especially in light of the fact that Boris is exactly what the UK has been looking for"". Brexit Party MEP Alex Phillips said MPs ""only had themselves to blame"" for the move. She told BBC News: ""They have made themselves the obstacle in front of delivering the referendum result. Boris Johnson is saying he now needs to remove that obstacle, and quite right too."" The leader of the DUP, Arlene Foster, also welcomed the decision to suspend Parliament and have a Queen's Speech, but said the terms of her party's confidence and supply agreement with the Conservatives would now be reviewed. ""This will be an opportunity to ensure our priorities align with those of the government,"" she added. This video can not be played What does proroguing Parliament mean? Parliament is normally suspended - or prorogued - for a short period before a new session begins. It is done by the Queen, on the advice of the prime minister. Parliamentary sessions normally last a year, but the current one has been going on for more than two years - ever since the June 2017 election. When Parliament is prorogued, no debates and votes are held - and most laws that haven't completed their passage through Parliament die a death. This is different to ""dissolving"" Parliament - where all MPs give up their seats to campaign in a general election. The last two times Parliament was suspended for a Queen's Speech that was not after a general election the closures lasted for four and 13 working days respectively. If this prorogation happens as expected, it will see Parliament closed for 23 working days. MPs have to approve recess dates, but they cannot block prorogation.

Pound falls as Queen asked to suspend ParliamentHow do you suspend Parliament?Video,"The pound was volatile on Wednesday following news that Parliament is to be suspended just days after MPs return to work on 3 September. The moveis expected to prevent opposition leadersfrom passing a law to stop a no-deal Brexit. The pound is down about 0.5% against both the euro and US dollar. So Â£1 is now worth â¬1.10 and $1.22. The FTSE 100, made up of stocks that could benefit from a devaluation of sterling, ended 0.4% ahead to 7,114.71. Many of those listed firms book much of their earnings in foreign currencies, and benefit from a weak pound. The FTSE 250, a stock index that is seen as more representative of the UK economy, closed down 0.7% to 19,202.99. Firms that are exposed to the domestic economy such as house builders and airlines were hit: Taylor Wimpey, Persimmon and Barratt Developments were down between 2% and 2.3%. Meanwhile, British Airways owner IAG fell 1.7% and easyJet dropped 3.2%. Why is the pound is getting weaker? Government asks Queen to suspend Parliament ""As far as the markets are concerned, there's a fair bit of bad news already baked in to the pound,"" according to David Cheetham, an analyst at currency trader XTB Online Trading. ""It is telling that after the knee-jerk move lower in recent trade, the selling we've seen is far from panic stations."" Discussing the prime minister's decision to suspend parliament, Mr Cheetham said: ""This seems like a pre-emptive strike from [Mr Johnson] against those seeking to block a no-deal Brexit and once more it seems that the opposition are in danger of fluffing a big opportunity to have an impact. ""If the government is successful in this, then a no-deal Brexit wouldn't be taken off the table until the 11th hour at the earliest and this keeps a significant downside risk to the pound in play."" And Michael Hewson, chief markets analyst at CMC, said: ""Sterling is under pressure as a consequence of the prospect of a no-deal Brexit increasing, while the FTSE 100 has jumped higher. ""Overall, though, this appears part and parcel of the ongoing battle between the various caucuses of MPs who want to block a no-deal Brexit at all costs, and those who want to retain the option as part of the ongoing attempts to renegotiate the withdrawal agreement."" The government has asked the Queen to suspend Parliament just days after MPs return to work in September - and only a few weeks before the Brexit deadline. Boris Johnson said a Queen's Speech would take place after the suspension, on 14 October, to outline his ""very exciting agenda"". But it means MPs are unlikely to have time to pass laws to stop a no-deal Brexit on 31 October. Queen approves Parliament suspension Can no-deal Brexit be stopped? Why are MPs being sent home again?

Brazil governors push president to accept fire aidThe plea from the governors comes after a spat between President Bolsonaro and the French president.,"This video can not be played ""It's extremely upsetting... to see this kind of devastation"" - the BBC's Will Grant flew over northern Rondonia state South American countries will meet to discuss a coordinated response to the fires ravaging the Amazon basin next week, Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro has announced. It comes after he refused a G7 offer of $22m (Â£18m) following a spat with French President Emmanuel Macron. Governors of the nine worst affected regions have urged him to reconsider. Mr Bolsonaro has now accepted Chile's offer of four planes to fight the fires, the most in Brazil since 2010. He revealed all countries in the Amazon region, apart from Venezuela, will meet on 6 September to further discuss a common policy. However, speaking after meeting his Chilean counterpart Sebastian Pinera, Mr Bolsonaro said he was not yet prepared to accept the G7 offer. ""The French government called me a liar,"" he said, according to Reuters news agency. ""Only after it has recanted what it said about me ... and the Brazilian people, who do not accept this diminution of the Amazon's sovereignty ... then we can talk again."" The Amazon is a vital carbon store that slows down the pace of global warming. President Bolsonaro said last week that his government lacked the resources to fight the fires. This video can not be played Why the Amazon rainforest helps fight climate change As international concern over the fires spread, leaders of the seven leading industrial nations meeting in France offered $22m to help fight the fires. Amazon fires: Ten of your questions answered Amazon: Lungs of the planet What about Bolivia's Amazon fires? President Macron, who was hosting the summit, said the funds would be made available immediately - primarily to pay for more firefighting planes. But President Bolsonaro rejected the offer arguing that the G7 countries were treating Brazil like ""a colony or a no-man's land"". That is not entirely clear yet. There has been a lot of back and forth on this. After ruling out accepting the aid, President Bolsonaro softened his stance a little on Tuesday saying he would consider doing so, if President Macron apologised for insulting him by calling him a liar - words he echoed on Wednesday. Altamira is one of the areas most devastated by the fires And following President Bolsonaro's meeting with the governors late on Tuesday, presidential spokesman Rego Barros said the Brazilian government ""is open to receiving financial support from organisations and countries"". However, Mr Barros stipulated that the aid would have to have the ""total governance of the Brazilian people"". There has been no response yet from the French government or the G7 countries. The governor of MaranhÃ£o state, FlÃ¡vio Dino, said he and his counterparts from other affected states had told Mr Bolsonaro that ""it's not the moment to turn down money"". Apart from the $22m the G7 countries offered,Hollywood actor Leonardo DiCaprio also pledged $5m to help fight the fires. Apple CEO Tim Cook also tweeted that the company would be ""donating to help preserve the Amazon rainforest's biodiversity"" but he did not name a figure,external. US PresidentDonald Trump tweeted that Mr Bolsonaro and Brazil ""have the full and complete support of the USA"",external. Reuters news agency says it has been told by a diplomatic source in Brasilia that the Brazilian government has accepted $12.2m from the UK government. The government says it has deployed 44,000 soldiers to seven states to combat the fires. Firefighters and soldiers have been deployed But the area affected is huge Prosecutors are also investigating allegations that some of the fires were trigged by the illegal clearing of land. The justice ministry says that federal police officers would be sent to the fire zones to assist other state agencies in combating ""illegal deforestation"". Data published by Brazil's space agency,externalsuggests there are. The agency, known as Inpe, says there have been more than 83,000 fires between 1 January 2019 and 27 August 2019. That is a 77% rise compared to the same period in 2018. Nasa has also warned,externalthat the ""2019 fires season has the highest fire count since 2012"". BBC analysis has also foundthat the high number of fires being recorded coincides with a sharp drop in fines being handed out for environmental violations. Jorgimar Alberto, from Roraima, one of the states most affected by the fires, has seen the burning of most of the land surrounding his wooden house. ""It's a risky situation, we have lots of crops here and everything is burning, such as the cashew trees,"" he told the BBC. ""I even had to keep the animals [inside] so that they don't burn as well. Every year it is the same, these fires are disturbing the region a lot."" Environmental officials helped him extinguish the fires last week only for them to reignite, he said. His wife could not stand staying in the house with the smell of burning and the threat getting ever closer, so she left. Jorgimar Alberto Dr Daniel Pires, meanwhile, told Brazil's Folha de S. Paulo newspaper that the number of children he had seen with respiratory problems since the early part of the month had doubled. ""This period has been very tough. The dry weather and the smoke causes many problems for children, such as pneumonia, coughing and secretion,"" the paediatrician, who works at Cosme e Damia Children's hospital in the Rondonia state capital of Porto Velho, said. But lumberyard owner Edson Oliveira from southern Amazonas said he did not believe the media coverage about the Amazon.

Crowds force early closure of China's first Costco,"This video can not be played Shoppers jostled for roast chicken at China's first Costco store US retailer Costco was forced to close early on its opening day in China, after the store was swamped with shoppers. Buyers battled long queues and traffic chaos, before the Shanghai store was shut hours early due to ""overcrowding"". Costco's push into China comes as other foreign retailers have struggled to compete with local rivals. It also comes at a time of rising tensions between the US and China over trade. Costco is a discount warehouse store that sells a range of goods, from fresh foods to household electronics. Some customers spent two hours lining up to pay for their purchases, while some had to wait three hours for parking, state news agency Xinhua reported. Images from the store show customers caught up in heavy crowds One video showed people pushing through heavy crowds to get their hands on roast chickens. ""Due to overcrowding in the market, and in order to provide you with a better shopping experience, Costco will temporarily close on the afternoon of August 27. Please avoid coming,"" the retailer in a notice on its official app, according to AFP. Some customers reportedly spent two hours lining up to pay for their goods Costco has had an online presence in China since 2014, through a partnership with e-commerce giant Alibaba. The firm's first store in the country comes as other international retailers battle tough competition in China. Earlier this year, Amazon said it was downsizing its operations in China and France's Carrefour agreed to sell 80% of its China business to local retailer Suning.com after a series of losses. Tesco hasstruggled to crack the Chinese market. Costco's China move also comes at a difficult time for US-China relations. Amazon plans to shut online store in China US-China trade war in 300 words The world's two largest economies have been fighting a trade war for the past year, and tensions have escalated with the threat of more tariffs from both sides.

Bury expelled by league after takeover collapses,"Bury fans have stepped up protests at Gigg Lane since last week Bury have been expelled by the English Football League after a takeover bid from C&N Sporting Risk collapsed. The League One club had been given until 17:00 BST on Tuesday to complete the deal, having been granted an extension to Friday's initial deadline. Bury are the first team to drop out of the EFL since Maidstone's liquidation in 1992. League One will comprise 23 clubs for the rest of the season, with only three teams to be relegated. ""When the news broke at Gigg Lane, fans instantly let out a huge cry - for help, of disbelief,"" said BBC Radio Manchester's Mike Minay. ""Fans walked away in instant tears, some crouching down to the floor."" EFL executive chair Debbie Jevans said it was ""one of the darkest days"" in the league's history, and added: ""I understand this will be a deeply upsetting and devastating time for Bury's players, staff, supporters and the wider community. ""There is no doubt today's news will be felt across the entire football family."" Financial issues 'insurmountable' - C&N Sporting Risk 'It cuts deep, all we want is to watch our team on a Saturday' How Bury went from promotion to expulsion Bolton Wanderers, also of League One,have been given 14 days to avoid being expelled themselves,with their prospective takeover by Football Ventures (Whites) Limited still yet to go through. In a statement on Monday, the club's administrators warned they were on the brink of liquidation, saying if they were unable to resurrect the move the club was ""not in a position to carry on trading"". However they said on Tuesday they would ""continue to work through the night"" to complete a deal, adding there would be another update ""as soon as possible"". The EFL had suspended each of Bury's first six fixtures this season, requesting evidence the Shakers could pay off creditors and had the funding to make it through the campaign. In a statement at 23:05 BST on Tuesday, the league said it decided ""after a long and detailed discussion"" to withdraw Bury's EFL membership ""with enormous regret"". ""No-one wanted to be in this position but following repeated missed deadlines, the suspension of five league fixtures, in addition to not receiving the evidence we required in regard to financial commitments and a possible takeover not materialising; the EFL board has been forced to take the most difficult of decisions,"" Jevans said. Bury were initially given until 23:59 BST on Friday to either provide the required information or find a buyer to take them over. With the third-tier side effectively an hour from being thrown out of the EFL, owner Steve Dale told BBC Radio Manchester he had sold the club and they were set to survive. That news subsequently secured them an extension until Tuesday to complete the deal, but C&N Sporting Risk quickly expressed concern it was still not enough time. An estimated 300 volunteers turned up at the club's Gigg Lane home on Tuesday to help get the ground ready for Saturday's scheduled game against Doncaster Rovers, but their efforts were in vain. Reacting to news of the Shakers' expulsion, Bury North MP James Frith was critical of the EFL and claimed there was a lack of consistency in how it has treated the situations at Bury and Bolton - allowing Bolton to play games but not Bury, for example. ""I'm angry. My head is in my hands. I feel Bury is the victimâ¦ and those left to pick up the pieces are the town and the community. Yes we will rise again and keep the faith but we shouldn't be at this point,"" he told BBC Radio 5 Live. ""We have to make this a moment in time for lower league football. We are just the latest victim of this. I have had clubs speak to me who are a default payment on a mortgage away from this."" Bury supporters cleaned the stadium in the hope that their game on Saturday would go ahead Founded in 1885 and first elected to the EFL nine years later, Bury were playing in what is now known as the Championship as recently as 1999 and have twice won the FA Cup. No club has ever dropped out of the third tier before, and the Shakers also become the first FA Cup winners to have been expelled by the EFL. England women's manager Phil Neville, whose mother Jill resigned as Bury's club secretary last week, described their demise as an ""absolute disgrace"" on Friday. Supporters staged numerous protests in the build-up to the deadline, with former director Joy Harthandcuffing herself to a drainpipeoutside their ground and a coffin reading 'RIP Bury FC 1885-?' was placed at the directors' entrance. Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham also wrote to EFL chief Jevans asking for the club to be granted more time""given the urgency of Bury's plight"".,external At the end of April, Bury were celebrating promotion back to the third tier of English football, but they were already enduring a torrid time off the pitch. The club was already in financial trouble when Dale bought it for Â£1 in December from previous owner Stewart Day, with players and staff often being paid late. A winding-up petition filed against the club was adjourned three times before eventually being dismissed by the High Court on 31 July. By then, creditors had approved a company voluntary arrangement (CVA) put forward by Dale, which was proposed to help settle some of their debts. The CVA meant unsecured creditors, including HM Revenue & Customs, would be paid 25% of the money owed - but also triggered a 12-point deduction in the League One table under EFL rules. Furthermore, the EFL were unsatisfied Bury had given enough evidence of their financial viability, leading to a string of postponed fixtures while the organisation awaited ""the clarity required"". On 9 August, the Shakers were given a 14-day deadline to provide the necessary information or face expulsion. That deadline expired at 23:59 BST on Friday. Emotions were running high as fans volunteered inside the stadium before being asked to leave The EFL had already outlined how it intended to balance the leagues if Bury were expelled: The current League One season would be completed with 23 teams, with the number of relegation places reduced to three. Four teams will still be promoted from League Two this season, ensuring League One is rebalanced in 2020-21. Only one team will be relegated from League Two, with two to be promoted from the National League as usual. It is not yet certain what will happen to Bury Football Club, its staff and players or the stadium. Paul Wilkinson was appointed manager on 2 July, but has not taken charge of a game. Before Saturday's announcement, the EFL said if the Shakers were expelled the club would ""be free to make an application to the Football Association to rejoin league competition further down the English football pyramid from season 2020-21"".

Bury challenges were 'insurmountable',"Bury fans finally learned that their club would be expelled from the league late on Tuesday evening Bury's expulsion from the English Football League is a ""tragedy"", says Sports Minister Nigel Adams. The financially stricken League One club lost their place in the EFL late on Tuesday night after a proposed takeover by C&N Sporting Risk fell through earlier in the day. ""This is a very dark day for English football,"" Adams said in a statement. ""It is a tragedy for the fans of Bury, the local community and everyone connected with the historic club."" Bury's heart 'ripped out' by expulsion - Neville Bury expelled from English Football League Reaction as Bury are expelled and Bolton get 14 days to find new owners He added: ""There will be a huge amount of anger and disbelief about how this happened. ""I have been in regular contact with the EFL and it is right that they closely review the processes at Bury to see if any lessons can be learned. ""The club's passionate fans don't deserve to go through this. I hope once the dust has settled they can begin to rebuild and take inspiration from other clubs that have done so before them."" Bury supporters have directed their anger at owner Steve Dale, who bought the club in December 2018 The Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee will meet in Parliament next week to discuss the situations at Bury and Bolton, who are stilltrying to conclude a takeover dealof their own. The committee's chairman Damian Collins says there must be changes to the way clubs are regulated, suggesting the Football Association should be given a legal responsibility to safeguard clubs. ""The role of the [English] Football League when things go wrong at clubs like Bury and Bolton is largely to just manage the process of decline, rather than to actually actively step in at an earlier stage when the club could be saved and turned around,"" he told BBC Radio 5 Live. ""Their main concern at the moment is not about saving Bury Football Club, it is about protecting the integrity of the competition, so they don't want clubs dropping out of the league during the season. ""It is totally understandable that is their prerogative, but I think fans deserve to know that - as is in other industries, such as the media for example - there are regulators that can step in and say 'we don't feel the management of this club is fit for purpose and, therefore, we are going to do something about it and save it'. ""I think what they [the FA] need is a legal power, just as Ofcom [the media regulator] have. They have a legal power over any company that holds a broadcasting licence, where they can step in and say 'we don't feel you are meeting your obligations and, therefore, we could remove your licence and give it to somebody else'. ""So they could save the club and take it out of the hands of a bad owner."" Bury won promotion from League Two last season despite their players going a number of months without being paid Bury's expulsion follows success on the pitch last season when they finished second in League Two and won promotion back to the third tier, having been relegated in 2018. Former FA chairman Greg Dyke says Bury's problems stemmed from chasing promotion without the finances to pay for it. ""Over the years some quite strange people have taken over and run football clubs and they don't necessarily know how to run them,"" he told BBC Radio 5 Live. ""The real issue is most football clubs at the lower levels are paying too much for the players. What is remarkable is that this doesn't happen more often. ""In the end if you're paying so much to buy players or for their wages and you're not getting that sort of money in, it's not a business at all is it? ""Whether the Football League has got the nerve to bring in wage caps and all those sorts of things will be interesting."" The businessmen who pulled out of a plan to take over Bury say they could not overcome the financial problems the club was facing. C&N Sporting Risk's bid was the only one the EFL would consider, despite reports of other potential buyers coming in around the 17:00 BST deadline on Tuesday, ""We were just going to face challenges that were insurmountable to allow us to do what we wanted to do if we took over the club,"" C&N's Rory Campbell told BBC Radio 5 Live. But C&N said the club's complicated financial structures were too difficult for it to sort out before the deadline passed. ""We did absolutely everything we could to try and get everything in place to try and make sure the takeover went through,"" added Campbell's colleague Henry Newman. ""Ultimately though, it was six years of a combination of financial mismanagement, errors in governance and issues that ultimately meant that to unravel them, in what was a short period of time, were incredibly difficult."" While neither Campbell nor Newman would go into specifics about the finances of the club, Bury had complicated leasing arrangements for their Gigg Lane ground, car parks and had a number of outstanding loans. ""The financial structures that were put in place were something that I'd never seen before and certainly were unsustainable,"" Newman added. ""My sympathy really does go out to the community as a whole at Bury because ultimately they're the ones that have suffered as a result of this. ""It was financially unsustainable and it's absolutely imperative that structures are put in place to ensure that something like this can't happen again."" This video can not be played Fans say Bury is a 'club, not a team' and a place to escape to 'something different' The focus now turns to what next for Bury. With the club expelled from the EFL, they will not be able to play again until next season at the earliest, and then it will be at a non-league level. The Football Association have also confirmed that Bury will ""no longer be able to participate"" in this season's FA Cup following Tuesday's events. The FA added: ""If the club re-forms, we look forward to them applying to make an application to The Football Association to rejoin league competition further down the English football pyramid from the 2020-21 season."" ""We have got a meeting this morning to look at our next move. What we would like to do is try and save this football club,"" Dave Giffard, chair of Forever Bury Supporters Club, told BBC Breakfast. ""If we have to restart as a phoenix club we would like to get hold of this ground. We have the support of the council."" Giffard was also critical of the EFL, which expelled the club despite reports of late bids for Bury coming in on Tuesday. ""The annoying thing is we had three more buyers there and the League wanted exclusivity with the one deal to concentrate on getting that through,"" he said. ""So we threw the other three in on the table last night. The proof of funding was there. Why they couldn't give us that little bit more time to get one over the line, we don't know."" The Professional Footballers' Association, which has stepped in to help pay some of the players' wages in recent months, said it will ""continue to support all of our members who have been impacted by the current situation, including former players, the remaining players who are contracted at the club and also those who were hoping to sign contracts"". Their statement added: ""Our thoughts in particular go out to the supporters, the town and the wider community who will be devastated by this news.""

Island mystery: 'How did my son die in Thailand?',"David Cornock was found dead almost four months ago but the cause of death remains undetermined Police in Thailand are being urged to investigate the unexplained death of a Scottish engineer in his own home. The body of David Cornock, 37, was discovered by his wife, Grecelle, in their bungalow in Koh Samui on 2 May. But it was eight days before a post mortem was held by which time the cause of death could not be established due to decomposition. The Foreign Office has raised the case with both the Thai Police and Interpol. David's father has also enlisted the help former detective David Swindle, co-founder ofJustice Abroad,external. Mr Cornock, of Montrose, told BBC Scotland: ""As a family we have been left in the dark and David's death remains undetermined. ""We have no visibility of the circumstances surrounding David's passing and have many concerns with regards to this. ""We will never see our beloved son again and we never got the opportunity to say goodbye. ""It is our duty to seek truth, clarity and justice."" This video can not be played 'We've never had official contact about our son's death' The engineering account manager last heard from David on Sunday 28 April. Mr Cornock, 59, recalled a typical long distance phone call in which they discussed football and roast dinners as his son prepared to meet up with some friends. The following day he received a text message from David - who has a son and stepdaughter in Brazil - with some advice about buying a motorbike. It was the last contact between them. At 11:00 on Thursday 2 May Mr Cornock's wife, Margaret, called him during a meeting in Aberdeen. ""I was completely shocked and bewildered,"" he said. ""I told the man I was with 'My son has just died' and he grabbed me. I don't remember the journey home. Looking back now it's like a dream. ""I still think David is going to walk in the house or give me a call."" David holding his son, David Jnr, with stepdaughter Paola and father David David's job had taken him to many parts of the world When David's body was repatriated on 17 May, Mr Cornock was contacted by an official who had reviewed the death certificate. It stated: ""Could not determine the cause of death due to decomposition changes in body."" The family were asked if they wanted a second post mortem but, anxious to avoid further delay, opted to proceed with the funeral. David's requiem mass was held in Alexandria, West Dunbartonshire, on 31 May and afterwards he was cremated. For the last three months the family have been anxiously seeking answers as to how David died. They are also striving to establish what, if anything, local officers did at the scene to collect and preserve evidence. But, to date, they have had no formal response from the Royal Thai Police. The only paperwork they have managed to obtain is a post mortem report which confirms a major delay between the discovery of David's body and the examination. The document, which they had to translate, concluded the cause of death could not be determined due to the decomposition of vital organs. David was brought up in the village of Renton, West Dunbartonshire, and later moved to Australia Mr Cornock said: ""David was a devoted father, son and friend to many. ""He was a global traveller, entrepreneur, generous to a fault, trusting, loved a laugh and had a great sense of humour. ""We are broken by his loss."" His wife Margaret added: ""I wouldn't like any other parent to go through what we are going through - sitting here, not having answers."" David's stepmother Margaret and father David have been left devastated by his death David was brought up in Renton, West Dunbartonshire, and emigrated to Brisbane in Australia with his father, stepmother and stepsister in 1996. He joined the Australian Navy and trained as an avionics engineer. When the family returned to Scotland in 2006 David worked in the offshore industry as a Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) engineer. The job took him all over the world, including stints in Australia, China and Brazil where he met his first wife, Ana Paula. She already had a daughter, Paola, and they had a son, David Luiz, in 2012. The family were living in Thailand when the couple split in 2015 but David continued to support them financially when they returned to Brazil. While on business in the US he met American national Grecelle Rivera and they married in Florida in July 2017. Retired Strathclyde Police detective David Swindle is best known for running Operation Anagram, which uncovered the crimes of serial killer Peter Tobin The Justice Abroad team are reviewing all available case related material on behalf of the family to support investigations conducted by the authorities on Koh Samui. Mr Swindle said: ""Surely there must have been investigations conducted at the time which can provide more information? ""Despite numerous requests for further information about the Thai Police investigation no case related documentation has been made available to David's family which is a shocking lack of transparency and terrible way to treat someone losing a loved one in such tragic circumstances."" The investigator who has worked with the families ofKirsty Maxwell and Craig Mallon, said families who lose loved ones abroad in unexplained circumstances abroad are often ""abandoned"". He added: ""David's family continue to be in dialogue with their elected member and the FCO to attempt to obtain the case related documentation which I sincerely hope will assist them understand what happened to David and the extent of police investigations carried out."" Police Scotland have no powers to investigate the circumstances as David was not ordinarily resident in Scotland. The family's MP Kirstene Hair, Conservative member for Angus, has written to Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab and Scottish Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf to request an update on the case A Foreign Office spokesman said: ""Our staff continue to provide support to the family of a British man following his death in Thailand and liaise with the Thai authorities"".

She became one of the leading voices in the Remain campaign in the 2016 EU referendum when she repeatedly clashed with Boris Johnson in a TV debate. In the 2017 election Ms Davidson led the Scottish Conservatives to their best result in a Westminster election since 1983. Without her Scottish Tories gaining 12 seats north of the border on 8 June, Theresa May would not have been able to form a government. She did not support Boris Johnson in this year's Conservative leadership race, backing instead Sajid Javid and then Jeremy Hunt. After Mr Johnson won the contest, Ms Davidson said she would ""judge his premiership by his actions in office"". However she has previously made her opposition to a no-deal Brexit clear writing in the Scottish Mail on Sunday that she would not support such a move. BBC Radio 5 Live The SNP's Europe spokesman at Westminster has said he is not surprised to hearRuth Davidson might quitas leader of the Scottish Conservatives. MP Stephen Gethins said: ""We don't know if it's true yet, but if it is I wouldn't be surprised."" ""I think anybody who believes in democracy will think that this is a dark day,"" he told 5 Live. Mr Gethins, whose party opposes a no-deal Brexit, said a prorogation would impact everybody - ""whether you believe in Brexit or not"". Former Chancellor Philip Hammond says the decision by Boris Johnson to suspend Parliament is ""profoundly undemocratic"" at a ""time of national crisis like this"". He says a number of MPs would have preferred to give the PM more time to see if he can get changes to the Brexit deal, before moving to prevent a no-deal in ""late September"". ""That will now not be possible and we will have to try to do something when Parliament returns next week,"" he tells reporters. He adds that he has ""made clear I am not interested in bringing down the government"", but he wants ministers to ""recognise"" the majority in Parliament is against a no-deal Brexit. Responding to the news thatRuth Davidson is expected to quitas leader of the Scottish Conservatives, Tory MP Tom Tugendhat says: ""This is a major blow to the union."" "",externalRuth Davidson has changed the story in our country and made a huge difference to our nation,"" he tweets. BBC Radio 5 Live Tory MP Steve Double defends Boris Johnson's move to suspend Parliament and says he does not know what ""the excitement is all about"". ""He isn't suspending Parliament for four weeks - we were going to be in recess for three weeks of that period anyway,"" he said. ""We will only be losing four days during September and October. I don't know what MPs think would have been achieved in those four days that they haven't been able to achieve in the last two or three years with regard to Brexit,"" he told 5 Live.

BuzzFeed Buzzfeed News reports that senior Downing Street officials have considered a series of ""extreme measures"" to distract parliament and ""force through"" Brexit on Halloween. The website's Alex Wickham says,externalNo 10 has even explored the creation of ""new bank holidays to prevent the House of Commons from being recalled"" during its suspension. âEvery sitting day there is a risk of something going wrong,â a government source told Buzzfeed. BBC News Channel SNP Europe spokesman Stephen Gethins says the request to suspend Parliament means Prime Minister Boris Johnson has ""moved into tinpot dictatorship territory"". He says he sees the move as an attempt to ""force a no-deal Brexit"", for which he says there is ""no mandate"". He adds that ""all sorts of legislation"" needs to be in place for the UK to leave the EU, which would require Parliament to remain open. ""What is clear from this action is that he knows he doesn't have the support in Parliament,"" he adds. Protesters are coming together in response to the prime minister's decision to suspend Parliament. Photos show a crowd of people at Downing Street in central London - including one person dressed as Boris Johnson digging a grave with the headstone ""RIP British Democracy"". Impromptu events organised on social media are also expected to take place in Manchester and Edinburgh this evening. Conservative MP Damian Collins has defended the prime minister's decision to prorogue Parliament, arguing that it ""doesn't mean there can't be a full debate on Brexit"". He accuses opposition politicians of spinning ""political hyperbole"". ""If they want to pass a motion through the House
making a no-deal Brexit possible they can do that as an amendment to the Queenâs
Speech,"" he says. ""Throughout this entire Brexit process the one thing
we have not been short of time on is open-ended parliamentary debate."" Boris Johnsonâs Brexit policy is to âdisembowel Parliamentâ and silence critical voices, the leader of Plaid Cymru says. Adam Price quoted Conservative figures who described the suspension of Parliament as a âconstitutional crisisâ. This video can not be played Plaid Cymru's Adam Price on suspending Parliament The request from ministers to the Queen to prorogue Parliament was made earlier today at a meeting of the Privy Council - a body which meets on average about once a month. The role of this body is usually rather routine, and mostly concerned with obtaining the monarch's formal approval for certain orders approved by ministers. One slightly unusual feature of Privy Council meetings is that they are held with all the participants - including the monarch - standing up. According to the body'sofficial website,external, it is thought that this custom was initiated by Queen Victoria in an effort to reduce her public duties after her husband Prince Albert died. Analysis BBC Radio 5 Live John Pienaar, the BBC's deputy political editor, said today we're seeing Boris Johnson beginning to ""not just win the battle of Brexit, but win the argument that will surround it"". The prime minister said a Queen's Speech would take place after the suspension of Parliament, on 14 October, to outline his ""very exciting agenda"" - and that the announcement was nothing to do with Brexit. ""If you wholly and unquestionably believe that, you will wholly and unquestionably believe anything,"" John Pienaar said on 5 Live. Simon Coveney, the Irish foreign minister, accused Boris Johnson's government of ""wiping the slate clean"" on the Irish backstop issue by opting to prorogue Parliament. Speaking at an event in Paris, he said: ""The disruptive impact of Britain leaving the European Union has a huge impact on the island of Ireland. We have a shared responsiblity with the British government to protect the peace process."" However, he added: ""Iâve always been careful not to get involved in the
parlimentary business of Westminster. They have a sovereign parliament and have
to make difficult decisions and choices.""  Shadow chancellor John McDonnell has
called the move to suspend parliament a ""very British coup"" with the
objective of ""preventing democracy working"". Mr McDonnell accused Boris Johnson of
""imposing a policy"" by preventing ""parliamentary debate and
discussion"". A Very British Coup is the title ofChris Mullin's novelin which a left-wing leader of the Labour Party becomes prime minister and is targeted by a conspiracy between civil servants, MI5, the CIA and the media. Chris Mullin was the Labour MP for Sunderland South from 1987-2010. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Stand-up comic Jenny Eclair seemed to speak for many when she tweeted her disappointment in the Queen. (Of course, it's possible she was joking...) But - to make a serious point - as our Royal Correspondent Jonny Dymond writes, it would have been impossible for the Queen to turn down the prime minister's request to suspend Parliament. ""The Queen acts on the advice of her prime minister,"" he said. ""While many, many people may be upset that Parliament is not going to sit at such time, precedent is on the side of those making this decision. ""The idea is these things are settled in the Palace of Westminster, not Buckingham Palace. ""The Queen had very little wriggle room to make any kind of political decision.""

Young drug dealers offered free driving lessonsThe scheme offers career opportunities and training to young people caught dealing in Bristol.Bristol,"Participants must be aged 16-21 and not have committed violent or sexual crimes Young drug dealers are being offered career opportunities, boxing sessions and driving lessons in a bid to end the ""revolving door"" of reoffending. Offenders are given training instead of facing court but participants suspected of crimes while on the scheme would be charged, police said. The Call-In scheme has been launched as a pilot in Bristol. The Home Office said operational decisions lay with chief constables but ""we expect them to enforce the law"". Drug convictions in England and Wales dropped slightly in 2018 to 67,831 from 75,695 in 2017. They were at their highest in recent times in 2012 at more than 98,000 in a year. Det Supt Gary Haskins said police wanted to ""take a chance"" with young dealers before they became one of these statistics. He admitted there was a risk they could reoffend during the mandatory six-to-nine months but said it was a risk Avon and Somerset Police was willing to take. Sessions offered during the Call-In scheme, which has funding from Bristol City Council, include non-contact boxing to look at fitness and anger management and a course with Street2Boardroom, which aims to help people to apply ""the hustle"" they have learned on the street to legitimate business. Mr Haskins said the scheme also helped people to get the necessary paperwork and qualifications to work in the construction industry, provided driving lessons and if appropriate, English lessons. Det Supt Gary Haskins said the Call-In looked at options to divert young people from a life of crime A Home Office spokesperson said: ""How police choose to pursue investigations is an operational decision for chief constables. ""We must prevent drug use in our communities and support people dependent on drugs through treatment and recovery."" The police told the BBC one person on the Call-In scheme had been removed and charged with dealing class A drugs. He will appear in Bristol Magistrates' Court in September. Another has been removed after being found in possession of a weapon. Class A, including crack cocaine, cocaine, ecstasy (MDMA), heroin and LSD - up to life in prison, an unlimited fine or both Class B, including Amphetamines, cannabis and ketamine - up to 14 years in prison, an unlimited fine or both Class C, including anabolic steroids, benzodiazepines and khat - up to 14 years in prison, an unlimited fine or both Source: Home Office,external Bristol City councillor and Deputy Mayor Asher Craig acknowledged the city has a growing issue with gang-related crime and said the Call-In scheme ""reaches out to young people involved in criminal activity and aims to turn their lives around for the better"". ""It offers the chance to intervene early and help young people get the mentoring and support they need to escape the downward cycle of drug related crime. ""The Call-In scheme is a pioneering partnership initiative based on a successful youth project in America. The scheme allows us to work closely with our partners to establish the best course of action for each individual. ""Through this, we can help young offenders discover a life free from drugs by providing the help they need to attain employment and learn vital life skills while reducing the amount of crime experienced by our communities."" Participants are chosen by a panel, must be aged between 16 and 21 and not have any convictions for sexual or violent offences. The first selected candidates began in February and up to 16 people will take part. Bristol has a high proportion of people who inject drugs in comparison with other similar areas, and the highest number of people in treatment in England who are users of bothcrack cocaine and heroin,external. Mr Haskins said other UK forces had tried similar sorts of schemes ""with varying degrees of success,"" but the Call-In was different because it gave young offenders a chance to stop and think before choosing to continue with a life of crime. He said: ""We're quite strict around it. We've had a good look at it, this is normally for people that have made that one mistake and people we think we can work with."" Once selected for the Call-In, participants are assessed by a panel who look at how to practically divert them from criminality. ""Why not give them a chance? What is there to lose? We send them to prison and we'll see them again,"" said Mr Haskins.

The group of friends from east Bristol grew up to become violent and dangerous criminals, using guns to enforce their hold on Bristol's drugs market. Now 43, he served most of his 20s and early 30s behind bars before leaving prison six years ago.  He is now working with Street2Boardroom.

Of the offenders he met in prison, he said many were ""good, loving, caring, intelligent - people who can do anything"". ""They just went down the wrong thing for a minute and it all went wrong,"" he said. ""But once they've been to jail, they ain't getting them same opportunities when they come out again.""

LiveReaction to Bury expulsion,"Bury expelled from English Football League Late bids to save 134-year-old club fail Bolton survive but have 14 days to find a buyer League One reduced to 23 clubs for 2019-20; only three teams to be relegated Denise Evans We're going to leave the Bury & Bolton reaction here for now. It's been a testing time for everyone involved with both clubs and the situation has clearly affected the wider football community, judging by your hundreds of tweets and texts coming in this morning. It's the end for Bury, for now, but there is still hope among supporters, while Bolton have been handed another lifeline. Follow theBBC Sport football section of websitefor latest news on both of these ever-developing stories. Thanks for joining us today. #bbcfootball or text 81111 (UK only)  As a Man City/Plymouth Argyle fan I am devastated what has happened to bury Plymouth nearly went out of business few years ago how we got lucky I don't know bury one of the historic clubs gain promotion to league to be expelled months later it's just horrible...Bury FC have the best history in football ever if there's anyone out there who can help a football club like bury please just please buy bury the fans have passion and desire they want an owner who is the same please anyone help Bury FC Adam Dear Bury fans. I'm sorry this has happened to you and I know that today it feels raw. But not all is lost and you have hope and if the club survives or when you revive it if it doesn't (as a group of fans too stubborn and too in love to let it go, I know you will), then you will rise again and believe me, you are in for a fun decade or so in the non league. Non League football is a genuine family and we will welcome you with open arms, and then celebrate with you when you are back where you belong, however long it takes. We look forward to being with you on the ride! Tom, Margate This announcement is a change from what the Bolton administrators said on Tuesday. They said the 145-year-old club was not in a position to carry on trading and ""the process of closing down"" could start on Wednesday. That would lead to its liquidation and the loss of over 150 jobs. But that process has now been put on hold for the time-being. The EFL said that if Bolton, one of the founder members of the Football League in 1888, cannot complete the sale or provide credible plans to continue, they will be served with a 14-day notice for their expulsion from the league. That remains in place. The club has confirmed that 'any plans that may have been made for the immediate closure of the club have been put on hold' by the administrator. #bbcfootball or text 81111 (UK only)  Would just like to say how sorry I am for Bury FC. As a fan of Spurs for over 50 years I can't begin to imagine the heartbreak for all the club's fans. Doesn't matter how big or small or what divisional status that club is, I really feel for you all & hope you can rise again in the future. Stephen Absolutely gutted for Bury. The EFL should hang their heads in shame, allowing Dale to take over the club in the first place. Brighton fans know full well about asset-stripping owners (Archer) - desperately hope Bury can come back and do an AFC Wimbledon. Anon If you're just joining us, here's what you've missed this morning.  #bbcfootball or text 81111 (UK only)  Bury fan for 53 years and devastated. The club has been destroyed by Day and Dale's malignant ownership and the EFL's negligent governance. Also, it's time supporters of EFL clubs stopped subsidising the PL via TV subscriptions, in return for a few crumbs. Bury fan Bury's plight has been brought on through years of spending money that wasn't there. There fans are part of the problem. They have stuck their head in the sand and celebrated promotion without paying players and having players who they couldn't afford and cheated promotion. EFL have done what they had to do to protect the game. Good riddance to a team that cheated promotion.

'Four months after celebrating promotion to League One, Bury now find themselves without a league altogether,' the story begins. Sadly, we all know how it ends. Read the bitsin-between here. #bbcfootball or text 81111 (UK only) Such a shame to see a proper club like Bury have this happen to them, loyal fans who could have supported other more successful local clubs such as Manchester City deserve a shout out especially. I was really looking forward to coming to both Bury and Bolton this season, I cannot begin to imagine how both clubs fans are feeling this morning. Ross, Sunderland Darlington fan here. Don't despair Bury fans, non league football is actually a lot more enjoyable than you think. Plenty of fresh talent down here, many go on to play for big clubs. Plus it's amazing what a few promotions on the bounce can do for club morale, it doesn't matter what league you're in! Matt As a Colchester Fan, we got to experience one of our best days in years last night, we created an upset, and that's the beauty of football that results like that can occur, for Bury, not only have they lost that chance, but they've lost their voice, and that speaks volumes. Despite their united community and their inarguable passion, nobody could save them, football is an indicative sport in England, and I'm disappointed that it comes down to this, I don't know who to blame but I know there needs to be justice for Bury, let's not have a repeat in two weeks with Bolton Ben M BBC Radio Manchester  Allow Twitter content?

This is without doubt a sad day for Bury FC, their
supporters and the local community. We appreciate how hard this decision has
been for all parties involved. Following
on from their expulsion from the English Football League, Bury FC will no
longer be able to participate in the Emirates FA Cup for the 2019/20 season. We
are therefore now consulting with our stakeholders regarding the first round
proper following their exit from the league. If
the club re-forms we look forward to them applying to make an application to
The Football Association to re-join league competition further down the English
football pyramid from the 2020/21 season. This picture sums up the pure frustration, upset and anger felt by Bury fans over the last 24 hours. #bbcfootball or text 81111 (UK only) Mike Durham:I feel no shame admitting that I - a big burly 50 something bloke - have tears in my eyes reading the comments from Bury fans. But you'll be back! There's too much love for you not to... David Bresnahan:As a fan of Stockport County and seeing us suffer administration, three relegations, lose players that were becoming club legends and going from a FT Football Club to a PT Non-League club. I never thought I'd ever think we were lucky. A very sad day for football It is with great sadness
to hear that Bury have been expelled from the English Football League after a
takeover bid from C&N Sporting Risk collapsed. We have been in regular communication with the players, the EFL
and the club over the last eight months to try and protect our members and
secure a long-term future for Bury FC. Unfortunately, despite our efforts to support the process, the
club has been unable to fulfill its financial commitments or complete a possible
take-over deal. This will be a desperately sad time for Buryâs players and staff. We will continue to support all our members who have been impacted
by the current situation, including former players, the remaining players who
are contracted at the club and also those who were hoping to sign contracts. Our thoughts in particular go out to the supporters, the town and
the wider community who will be devastated by this news. The background story on how Bury have ended up being expelled from the EFL has been updated. Youcan read it here #bbcfootball or text 81111 (UK only)  I do feel for the Bury staff and fans, they don't deserve this, but the fact is the club does! They have spent massively beyond their means for as long as I can remember and, as much as the EFL can be blamed, the club has to accept responsibility. Michael Bury and Bolton fans, as a Pompey lad I know how you guys have been feeling. To go from 2008 FA cup winners and watching European football at Fratton park within a couple of years seeing your club fall into unbelievable debt and being punished with point deductions and relegations, forced to sell players and plummet down the leagues.

Young drug dealers offered free driving lessons,"Participants must be aged 16-21 and not have committed violent or sexual crimes Young drug dealers are being offered career opportunities, boxing sessions and driving lessons in a bid to end the ""revolving door"" of reoffending. Offenders are given training instead of facing court but participants suspected of crimes while on the scheme would be charged, police said. The Call-In scheme has been launched as a pilot in Bristol. The Home Office said operational decisions lay with chief constables but ""we expect them to enforce the law"". Drug convictions in England and Wales dropped slightly in 2018 to 67,831 from 75,695 in 2017. They were at their highest in recent times in 2012 at more than 98,000 in a year. Det Supt Gary Haskins said police wanted to ""take a chance"" with young dealers before they became one of these statistics. He admitted there was a risk they could reoffend during the mandatory six-to-nine months but said it was a risk Avon and Somerset Police was willing to take. Sessions offered during the Call-In scheme, which has funding from Bristol City Council, include non-contact boxing to look at fitness and anger management and a course with Street2Boardroom, which aims to help people to apply ""the hustle"" they have learned on the street to legitimate business. Mr Haskins said the scheme also helped people to get the necessary paperwork and qualifications to work in the construction industry, provided driving lessons and if appropriate, English lessons. Det Supt Gary Haskins said the Call-In looked at options to divert young people from a life of crime A Home Office spokesperson said: ""How police choose to pursue investigations is an operational decision for chief constables. ""We must prevent drug use in our communities and support people dependent on drugs through treatment and recovery."" The police told the BBC one person on the Call-In scheme had been removed and charged with dealing class A drugs. He will appear in Bristol Magistrates' Court in September. Another has been removed after being found in possession of a weapon. Class A, including crack cocaine, cocaine, ecstasy (MDMA), heroin and LSD - up to life in prison, an unlimited fine or both Class B, including Amphetamines, cannabis and ketamine - up to 14 years in prison, an unlimited fine or both Class C, including anabolic steroids, benzodiazepines and khat - up to 14 years in prison, an unlimited fine or both Source: Home Office,external Bristol City councillor and Deputy Mayor Asher Craig acknowledged the city has a growing issue with gang-related crime and said the Call-In scheme ""reaches out to young people involved in criminal activity and aims to turn their lives around for the better"". ""It offers the chance to intervene early and help young people get the mentoring and support they need to escape the downward cycle of drug related crime. ""The Call-In scheme is a pioneering partnership initiative based on a successful youth project in America. The scheme allows us to work closely with our partners to establish the best course of action for each individual. ""Through this, we can help young offenders discover a life free from drugs by providing the help they need to attain employment and learn vital life skills while reducing the amount of crime experienced by our communities."" Participants are chosen by a panel, must be aged between 16 and 21 and not have any convictions for sexual or violent offences. The first selected candidates began in February and up to 16 people will take part. Bristol has a high proportion of people who inject drugs in comparison with other similar areas, and the highest number of people in treatment in England who are users of bothcrack cocaine and heroin,external. Mr Haskins said other UK forces had tried similar sorts of schemes ""with varying degrees of success,"" but the Call-In was different because it gave young offenders a chance to stop and think before choosing to continue with a life of crime. He said: ""We're quite strict around it. We've had a good look at it, this is normally for people that have made that one mistake and people we think we can work with."" Once selected for the Call-In, participants are assessed by a panel who look at how to practically divert them from criminality. ""Why not give them a chance? What is there to lose? We send them to prison and we'll see them again,"" said Mr Haskins. This video can not be played Former gang member Clinton Wilson helping young people to avoid a life of crime A supporter of the scheme is former drug dealer Clinton Wilson, AKA King Aggi, who was at one time the leader of one of Bristol's most notorious gangs - the Aggi Crew. The group of friends from east Bristol grew up to become violent and dangerous criminals, using guns to enforce their hold on Bristol's drugs market. Now 43, he served most of his 20s and early 30s behind bars before leaving prison six years ago.  He is now working with Street2Boardroom. ""When I see them making silly mistakes obviously I want to tell them 'if you carry on doing that, this is where you're going to go',"" he said. Drugs room plan scrapping criticised 'Safer' needles for drug users has global interest Drugsland: 'We want to go after the bad people' Mr Wilson grew up in St Pauls and said, after a good upbringing, at 15 he chose the ""wrong path"", lured by the money that could be made dealing drugs. Of the offenders he met in prison, he said many were ""good, loving, caring, intelligent - people who can do anything"". ""They just went down the wrong thing for a minute and it all went wrong,"" he said. ""But once they've been to jail, they ain't getting them same opportunities when they come out again."" He said police needed to concentrate on ""the worst ones"" rather than those who were ""half-hearted"" about a life of crime. ""If they're not cut out for it, they'll soon get taken out of the game anyway,"" he said. ""It's the ones that are cut out for itâ¦"" The Call-In and Clinton Wilson both feature in Beyond the Front Line which airs on BBC One in the West at 23:15 BST on Wednesday 28 August and on the BBC News Channel at 21:30 BST on Friday 30 August.

Where next for Bolton?,"Bolton supporters have seen their side lose 22 of the 28 games they have played since the turn of the year ""It's heartbreaking. It cannot happen to the club and town. It's a devastating prospect."" Bolton Wanderers face two of the most crucial weeks in their 145-year history after they were given a 12 September deadline by the English Football League to complete a sale or prove they have the funds to finish the season. A takeover of the club by Football Ventures collapsed at the weekend, plunging their immediate future into doubt. But how did one of the founder members of the Football League, who reached the last 16 of the Uefa Cup only 11 years ago, reach this point and where do they go now? BBC Sport looks at what is next for this historic club as it faces the threat of extinction. Bolton given 14-day expulsion deadline Bury expelled from English Football League Monday's administrators' statement said that the deal to sell the club collapsed after all parties involved agreed terms to complete the sale, other than former owner Ken Anderson. The news left those at the club stunned, with the administrators suggesting 150 jobs could be lost if they went under. ""We are very worried at the prospect of the club being liquidated and we urge all parties involved to work together to get a deal to save us sorted,"" an unnamed staff source told the BBC. ""We are a founder member of the Football League and have a long and proud history in English football. ""For Bolton Wanderers to no longer exist is unthinkable."" Bolton Wanderers: Joy and despair after Wanderers got back on home soil Much of the summer has been a stalemate as the protracted takeover showed no sign of getting over the line, leaving the club's fan base hoping a last-minute deal could be done to get the takeover back on track. ""Please, please save this club. You've got so much on the line here. You've got several generations and the whole Bolton community just pleading for you to get this deal done,"" Will Jones, of fan blog Lion of Vienna Suite, told BBC Radio Manchester. ""You've got the elderly generation who've been watching for 70-80 years and it might be the last thing they have left. ""For the parents who have got to tell their youngsters that they are not able to go and watch their club on a Saturday any more, that's just devastating in itself. ""It's absolutely devastating and all I'd say is please do it for the community and the club because it does not deserve this."" Club legend and former striker John McGinlay, who scored 118 times in five years with Wanderers, said ""there's a fear and a worry when it gets to this stage"". McGinlay was the last man to score at Bolton's old ground Burnden Park before their move to the Reebok Stadium in 1997 and finished as top scorer as Bolton bounced straight back to the Premier League. ""It's time to either put your money on the table or walk away because we've been through this for long enough,"" McGinlay told BBC Radio Manchester. ""We've been told the deal is imminent or just about to be signed for so long and it's really frustrating now. ""All of us supporters are now worried and it's coming to the end of the line now. The statements in the past couple of days from the administrators and EFL have really brought things to a head."" Bolton Wanderers' 5-0 loss to Ipswich Town on Saturday was the third match in a row that they had conceded five goals and came in front of a record low attendance at the University of Bolton Stadium ""Generally speaking, most people up and down the country probably think that has been going on for a very short time,"" Maggie Tetlow of Bolton Wanderers Supporters' Trust told BBC Radio 5 Live. ""However, this has been rumbling on since Ken Anderson took charge."" Bolton were relegated from the Premier League in 2012 Four years later their football existence was threatened before former striker Dean Holdsworth waspart of a takeoverat the club Andersontook controlafter Holdsworth's company Sports Shield were wound up Wanderersentered administration in Mayafter being relegated from the Championship, before Football Ventures agreed a deal to take over the club The deal was almost stopped after Laurence Bassini, who had bid to buy the club before administration, was awarded a court order blocking the sale on 8 August The court order was adjourned paving the way for the takeover to continue before it eventually collapsed The clubcalled off their match against Doncasterlast week citing welfare concerns having only five senior outfield players available Boss Phil Parkinson resigned on Thursday after three years with the club and a young side lost 5-0 against Ipswich on Saturday ""There's something wrong in British football where these clubs with so much history and local connection are struggling at the same time the Premier League is absolutely booming,"" Bolton North East MP David Crausby told BBC Radio Manchester. ""We've really got to put it right in the interest of the fans, not just for some individual who picks it up to make a profit on it. ""We've got to be absolutely determined to defend this football institution. It can't be allowed to fail and disappear."" Bolton fielded their youngest-ever team in their draw against Coventry earlier this season - with their starting XI having an average age of just 19 On Saturday, the EFL gave Bolton until its board meeting at 17:00 on Tuesday to complete a sale of the club or provide ""credible plans"" they can compete this season. As Bolton could not satisfy the league's requirements by that point, a 14-day notice period was activated for the club to prove it has the funds to survive or face losing its place in the league. Local neighbours Bury, who have had stark financial troubles of their own, were expelled from the Football League on Tuesday after failing to sell the club. Wanderers' administrators said on Monday that the club are not in a position to carry on trading and ""the process of closing down"" could start on Wednesday.

It's been a testing time for everyone involved with both clubs and the situation has clearly affected the wider football community, judging by your hundreds of tweets and texts coming in this morning. It's the end for Bury, for now, but there is still hope among supporters, while Bolton have been handed another lifeline.

I'm sorry this has happened to you and I know that today it feels raw. But not all is lost and you have hope and if the club survives or when you revive it if it doesn't (as a group of fans too stubborn and too in love to let it go, I know you will), then you will rise again and believe me, you are in for a fun decade or so in the non league. Non League football is a genuine family and we will welcome you with open arms, and then celebrate with you when you are back where you belong, however long it takes. We look forward to being with you on the ride! Tom, Margate This announcement is a change from what the Bolton administrators said on Tuesday. They said the 145-year-old club was not in a position to carry on trading and ""the process of closing down"" could start on Wednesday. That would lead to its liquidation and the loss of over 150 jobs. But that process has now been put on hold for the time-being. The EFL said that if Bolton, one of the founder members of the Football League in 1888, cannot complete the sale or provide credible plans to continue, they will be served with a 14-day notice for their expulsion from the league. That remains in place. The club has confirmed that 'any plans that may have been made for the immediate closure of the club have been put on hold' by the administrator. #bbcfootball or text 81111 (UK only)  Would just like to say how sorry I am for Bury FC. As a fan of Spurs for over 50 years I can't begin to imagine the heartbreak for all the club's fans. Doesn't matter how big or small or what divisional status that club is, I really feel for you all & hope you can rise again in the future. Stephen Absolutely gutted for Bury. The EFL should hang their heads in shame, allowing Dale to take over the club in the first place. Brighton fans know full well about asset-stripping owners (Archer) - desperately hope Bury can come back and do an AFC Wimbledon. Anon If you're just joining us, here's what you've missed this morning.  #bbcfootball or text 81111 (UK only)  Bury fan for 53 years and devastated. The club has been destroyed by Day and Dale's malignant ownership and the EFL's negligent governance. Also, it's time supporters of EFL clubs stopped subsidising the PL via TV subscriptions, in return for a few crumbs. Bury fan Bury's plight has been brought on through years of spending money that wasn't there. There fans are part of the problem. They have stuck their head in the sand and celebrated promotion without paying players and having players who they couldn't afford and cheated promotion. EFL have done what they had to do to protect the game. Good riddance to a team that cheated promotion.

Don't despair Bury fans, non league football is actually a lot more enjoyable than you think. Plenty of fresh talent down here, many go on to play for big clubs. Plus it's amazing what a few promotions on the bounce can do for club morale, it doesn't matter what league you're in! Matt As a Colchester Fan, we got to experience one of our best days in years last night, we created an upset, and that's the beauty of football that results like that can occur, for Bury, not only have they lost that chance, but they've lost their voice, and that speaks volumes. Despite their united community and their inarguable passion, nobody could save them, football is an indicative sport in England, and I'm disappointed that it comes down to this, I don't know who to blame but I know there needs to be justice for Bury, let's not have a repeat in two weeks with Bolton Ben M BBC Radio Manchester  Allow Twitter content?

This is without doubt a sad day for Bury FC, their
supporters and the local community. We appreciate how hard this decision has
been for all parties involved. Following
on from their expulsion from the English Football League, Bury FC will no
longer be able to participate in the Emirates FA Cup for the 2019/20 season. We
are therefore now consulting with our stakeholders regarding the first round
proper following their exit from the league. If
the club re-forms we look forward to them applying to make an application to
The Football Association to re-join league competition further down the English
football pyramid from the 2020/21 season. This picture sums up the pure frustration, upset and anger felt by Bury fans over the last 24 hours. #bbcfootball or text 81111 (UK only) Mike Durham:I feel no shame admitting that I - a big burly 50 something bloke - have tears in my eyes reading the comments from Bury fans.

David Bresnahan:As a fan of Stockport County and seeing us suffer administration, three relegations, lose players that were becoming club legends and going from a FT Football Club to a PT Non-League club. I never thought I'd ever think we were lucky. A very sad day for football It is with great sadness
to hear that Bury have been expelled from the English Football League after a
takeover bid from C&N Sporting Risk collapsed. We have been in regular communication with the players, the EFL
and the club over the last eight months to try and protect our members and
secure a long-term future for Bury FC. Unfortunately, despite our efforts to support the process, the
club has been unable to fulfill its financial commitments or complete a possible
take-over deal. This will be a desperately sad time for Buryâs players and staff. We will continue to support all our members who have been impacted
by the current situation, including former players, the remaining players who
are contracted at the club and also those who were hoping to sign contracts. Our thoughts in particular go out to the supporters, the town and
the wider community who will be devastated by this news. The background story on how Bury have ended up being expelled from the EFL has been updated. Youcan read it here #bbcfootball or text 81111 (UK only)  I do feel for the Bury staff and fans, they don't deserve this, but the fact is the club does! They have spent massively beyond their means for as long as I can remember and, as much as the EFL can be blamed, the club has to accept responsibility. Michael Bury and Bolton fans, as a Pompey lad I know how you guys have been feeling. To go from 2008 FA cup winners and watching European football at Fratton park within a couple of years seeing your club fall into unbelievable debt and being punished with point deductions and relegations, forced to sell players and plummet down the leagues. We are slowly climbing our way back and you both will too, no matter what league you may play in next season you can't take out the passion and love from the fans and you will come back a stronger club, and the rest of the country (bar your biggest rivals) will be following you too.

Brazil rejects G7 Amazon fire aid over 'insults'President Bolsonaro demands an apology from his French counterpart for calling him a liar.,"This video can not be played ""It's extremely upsetting... to see this kind of devastation"" - the BBC's Will Grant flew over northern Rondonia state Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has ruled out accepting a G7 offer of aid to fight fires in the Amazon rainforest unless he gets an apology from his French counterpart, Emmanuel Macron. Mr Bolsonaro said the French leader should apologise for insulting him personally by calling him a liar. Mr Macron had accused him of ""lying"" about fighting climate change. Aid worth $22m (Â£18m) was announced by Mr Macron at a summit in France of the seven leading industrial powers. What about Bolivia's Amazon fires? Amazon fires: Ten of your questions answered Satellite data show a huge increase in the number of fires burning in Brazil, most of them in the Amazon region. Earlier, Brazilian ministers said the G7 money was not needed and they accused foreign powers of wanting control of the Amazon. Last week, Mr Macron said Mr Bolsonaro had ""lied"" to him at a G20 summit in Osaka, Japan, in June by failing to respect his climate commitments and by failing to pursue biodiversity. Mr Macron said France would not ratify a huge trade deal with South American nationsunless Brazil did more to fight fires in the Amazon. Emmanuel Macron (L) and Jair Bolsonaro at the G20 Summit in Osaka On Tuesday, Mr Bolsonaro told reporters in the capital Brasilia: ""Mr Macron must withdraw the insults that he made to my person. Firstly, he called me a liar."" He also accused Mr Macron of questioning Brazilian sovereignty over the Amazon region, Brazilian news website G1 reports. ""To talk or to accept anything from France, whether it be with the best possible intentions, he [Mr Macron] will have to withdraw those words and then we can talk,"" he said. The two presidents hold sharply different political views, with Mr Bolsonaro hailing from the far right in Brazil and Mr Macron elected in a run-off against the far right in France. In another development, Mr Bolsonaro responded to a joke on Facebook mocking the age of Mr Macron's wife Brigitte who, at 65, is 25 years his senior. He wrote: ""Do not humiliate the guy, ha ha."" Asked about Mr Bolsonaro's remarks,Mr Macron said they were ""extraordinarily rude"" and ""sad"". Adding to the row over the aid offer, Mr Bolsonaro's chief of staff, Onyx Lorenzoni, mocked the fire that ravaged Notre-Dame cathedral in Paris in April. ""Macron cannot even avoid a predictable fire in a church that is part of the world's heritage and he wants to give us lessons for our country?"" he said, quoted by the Globo news website. As the largest rainforest in the world, the Amazon is a vital carbon store that slows down the pace of global warming. It spans a number of countries, but the majority of it falls within Brazil. Fire damage in Brazil's Otuquis National Park Otuquis National Park is part of the Pantanal ecoregion, known for its wetlands Wildfires often occur in the dry season in Brazil but satellitedata published by Brazil's space agency show an increase of 80% this year,external. It is the highest number of fires since 2010. BBC analysis has also found that the growth in the number of fires coincided with a sharp drop in finesbeing handed out for environmental violations. Amazon: Lungs of the planet Mr Bolsonaro has previously said his government lacks the resources to fight the record number of fires in the Amazon regionbut his government is also being accused of slashing funding for environmental protection. ""The funding for Brazil's environment agency has gone down by 95% this year,"" Yadvinder Malhi, professor of Ecosystem Science at the University of Oxford, told the BBC's Today programme. On Friday, President Bolsonaro authorised the military to help tackle the blazes. This video can not be played Why the Amazon rainforest helps fight climate change Brazil says 44,000 soldiers have been deployed to combat the fires and environmental crimes in the Amazon, and military operations are under way in seven states as the result of requests for assistance from local governments. Jorgimar Alberto, from Roraima, one of the states most affected by the fires, has seen the burning of most of the land surrounding his wooden house. Jorgimar Alberto ""It's a risky situation, we have lots of crops here and everything is burning, such as the cashew trees,"" he told the BBC. ""I even had to keep the animals [inside] so that they don't burn as well. Every year it is the same, these fires are disturbing the region a lot."" Environmental officials helped him extinguish the fires last week only for them to reignite, he said. His wife could not stand staying in the house with the smell of burning and the threat getting ever closer, so she left. Lumberyard owner Edson Oliveira from southern Amazonas said he did not believe the media coverage about the Amazon. ""In my opinion, the parts that are burning are the same that burn every year,"" he told the BBC. Asked what he would like politicians to do for the Amazon, he said that he would like ""economic alternatives for people here, to find a way we can make use of the natural wealth we have here"". ""It's no use pointing the finger at what's wrong without bringing alternatives to people,"" he said. The $22m was announced on Monday as the leaders of the G7 - Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the US - met in Biarritz, France. Mr Macron said the funds would be made available immediately - primarily to pay for more firefighting planes - and that France would also ""offer concrete support with military in the region"". This video can not be played Members of Brazil's indigenous Mura tribe vow to defend their land Greenpeace France described the G7's response to the crisis as ""inadequate given the urgency and magnitude of this environmental disaster"". As international concern over the fires spread, Hollywoodactor Leonardo DiCaprio pledged $5m towards helping the rainforest. He has long maintained that European countries are trying to gain access to Brazil's natural resources. He alleges that European interest in the welfare of the Amazon is a thin guise for attempts to gain a foothold in the region.
