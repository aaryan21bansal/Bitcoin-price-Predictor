Calls for guidance on workplace social distancing,"Many workers are concerned guidelines are not clear enough There are calls for employers to apply better social distancing guidelines and measures in the workplace to prevent the transmission of coronavirus. Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham says companies are ""nowhere near observing"" distancing rules. He said he had been contacted by more than 300 members of the public, highlighting concerns at 150 companies. Mr Burnham said: ""I would like to see a stronger policy on workplaces now."" Coronavirus testing rolled out for frontline NHS staff Can I get tested for coronavirus? UK wary of international market for ventilators How fast is the coronavirus growing in the UK? What we don't know about coronavirus deaths Social distancing means people must stay more than 2m (6ft) apart from others. Theconstruction industryandsupermarketsare among those struggling to adhere to the restriction while continuing to operate. Jennie, 54, works in various supermarkets stacking shelves and says maintaining the two-metre rule is ""quite difficult"". ""I have had people reach across me to get items,"" she says, ""Some customers are quite respectful but others want to do their shopping and that's the end of it."" Jennie isconsidered to be in an at-risk groupand worries someone could pass the virus on to her, but says: ""I've got no choice but to work, I've got a mortgage to pay."" ""I'm not having a moan at the supermarkets or anything but I do think the workers should be getting tested,"" she added. The GMB union said employers needed ""to shut up shop"" if they could not make their workplaces safe. General secretary Tim Roache said: ""As a nation we are asking so much of so many frontline workers - in our NHS and care but also in supermarkets, distribution, utilities, and food. ""The least we can do is try to keep them and their families safe."" But some workers are taking matters into their own hands. Asit Raja, 60, who has been a pharmacist in Manchester for 37 years, decided to set up a barrier in the community pharmacies where he works,  using cardboard boxes to maintain distance. However, he admits this method is proving troublesome, since he cannot throw medication at people from a distance. Mr Raja said: ""I'm trying to keep social distancing as much as possible but it just doesn't work. The maximum is going to be an arm's length away. If someone's elderly and they can't reach, you have to come close to them. ""There is a cost to having the shields in place and there is also the manpower issue - there are a limited number of companies out there who can physically visit pharmacies and install these."" He added that the virus was also having an emotional effect on colleagues. ""I was working in a pharmacy yesterday and a member of staff broke down. Same happened last week, I was working in a pharmacy, I had to make a member of staff a cup of tea because they'd broken down. They just cannot cope"" said Mr Raja. Mr Roache says too many employers are paying ""lip service"" to protecting their employees but actually leaving people and their communities vulnerable. He called on the government to intervene, insisting: ""We need tighter guidance on what constitutes 'essential' and enforcement measures."" It comes after Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Health Secretary Matt Hancock bothtested positive for the Covid-19and began self-isolating. Concerns have been raised about who else they might have come into contact with. Both said they had mild symptoms and would keep working from home. Former Cabinet Secretary Gus O'Donnell said politicians needed to obey their own rules after pictures from the House of Commons earlier this week showed several ministers crowded together. ""They do need to learn a lesson from this and actually obey their own rules much more strictly,"" he told the Today Programme. But Mr Burnham said: ""It's very hard, because of the nature of that place, to keep social distances."" A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? AVOIDING CONTACT:Should I self-isolate?

"Trump 'considering quarantine on New York'The president says he is considering quarantining the state, but its governor expresses concern.","This video can not be played Donald Trump tells reporters he is ""considering quarantine"" for some areas US President Donald Trump has said he is considering imposing a quarantine on New York state in a bid to slow the spread of the deadly coronavirus. ""We'd like to see [it] quarantined because it's a hotspot,"" he told reporters. ""I'm thinking about that."" He spoke as confirmed cases in the state increased to more than 52,000, about half of the total in the US. But New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said the idea was ""preposterous"", ""anti-American"" and a ""declaration of war"". Mr Cuomo said the state had already implemented ""quarantine"" measures, such as banning major gatherings and ordering people to remain at home, but that he would oppose any ""lockdown"" efforts. ""If you said we were geographically restricted from leaving, that would be a lockdown,"" Mr Cuomo told CNN on Saturday. ""Then we would be Wuhan, China, and that wouldn't make any sense,"" he said, adding that this would cause the stock market to crash in a way that would make it impossible for the US economy to ""recover for months, if not years"". ""You would paralyse the financial sector,"" he said. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? AVOIDING CONTACT:Should I self-isolate? STRESS:How to protect your mental health MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak Mr Cuomo earlier told reporters that he had spoken with Mr Trump by phone, but that the president hadn't mentioned a state ""quarantine"". ""I haven't had those conversations,"" he said, adding: ""I don't even know what that means."" Mr Cuomo said he would sue Rhode Island if the authorities there continued targeting New Yorkers and threatening to punish them for failing to quarantine. Rhode Island Governor Gina Raimondo has also described New York as a ""hot zone"", and has mobilised soldiers to seek out those leaving the state. New York state has the highest number of cases of Covid-19 in the US. Speaking before he left to visit a US Navy hospital ship in Virginia, Mr Trump said that ""New Jersey [and] certain parts of Connecticut"" could also be quarantined under the measures. ""We might not have to do it but there's a possibility that sometime today we'll do a quarantine â short term [for] two weeks,"" he said. Allow Twitter content?

But Mr Cuomo, who was holding a daily press briefing at the time of Mr Trump's comments on Saturday, expressed concern at the idea. ""I don't know how that can be legally enforceable,"" he said. ""And from a medical point of view, I don't know what you would be accomplishing. ""But I can tell you I don't even like the sound of it. Not even understanding what it is, I don't like the sound of it."" New York's governor expressed concern at the idea of a quarantine Mr Trump did not provide further details about what quarantining New York or other badly hit US states would look like. But he said it would be aimed at slowing the spread of the virus to other parts of the US. ""They're having problems down in Florida. A lot of New Yorkers are going down. We don't want that,"" he said as he left the White House. Similar quarantine measures in other countries have involved widespread closures, bans on public gatherings and major restrictions on travel in and out of the affected area. The White House has said anyone leaving New York City should self-isolate for 14 days. On Friday, the governor of nearby Rhode Island deployed National Guard troops to stop cars with a New York licence plate to remind them of the state's restriction that they quarantine. Soldiers are going door-to-door in coastal vacation communities to ask if any residents have recently visited New York City. Analysis by Peter Bowes, BBC News, Los Angeles The quarantining of entire states would mark a significant and ominous ramping up of the Trump administration's response to the coronavirus. There have been rumours for the past two weeks that a mandatory, national quarantine could be implemented, but this is the first time Mr Trump has indicated that state borders could be closed. The initial response of the governor of New York suggests an attempt by the federal government to quarantine the state could be problematic. While the president does have sweeping powers, especially during a national emergency, it is the role of state and local governments to take the lead in preventing the spread of disease. Mr Trump said there would be a decision very soon and that trade between states would not be affected. But if he goes ahead, such an order could be challenged in the courts. With more than 1,800 virus-related fatalities, the US death toll remains lower than those in Italy and China. But there are virus hotspots in New York, New Orleans, Detroit and Seattle. In his press briefing, Mr Cuomo said New York was postponing its presidential primary by almost two months until 23 June as a result of the outbreak. He also said the apex of the crisis would occur in the next 14 to 21 days. Mr Cuomo said the state would soon require 30,000 respiratory ventilators, which had increased in price to $45,000 (Â£36,000) each due to demand. He added that Mr Trump had approved the construction of four temporary hospitals. Demand for ventilators has also doubled in the southern state of Louisiana. Governor John Bel Edwards said New Orleans would run out of ventilators by 2 April and possibly run out of hospital beds by 7 April if the number of new infections did not subside. ""It's not some flimsy theory. This is what is going to happen,"" he said. President Trump has ordered a car manufacturer in Detroit to produce more ventilators.

The month EVERYTHING changed,"In the space of a month, the United Kingdom has transformed beyond recognition. And most of us haven't had time to stop and take stock. One Friday afternoon, when the UK was another country, a chalkboard leaned against the outside wall of a country pub. A message had been written in neat, thin capital letters. ""Unfortunately a customer who visited us has tested positive for the coronavirus,"" it read. ""So as a precautionary measure we are closing for a full deep clean."" It was signed by the landlord and landlady, who apologised for the inconvenience. The pub was located along a quiet, narrow road just outside Haslemere in Surrey. The patient who had gone there lived somewhere in the county. Unlike previous British cases detected up to that point - he was the 20th - he hadn't been abroad recently. As far as anyone knew, he was the first to catch the virus inside the UK. On the same day, 28 February 2020, came another news update. A grimmer milestone. A British man who'd been infected on the Diamond Princess cruise ship became the first UK citizen to die, in Japan, from Covid-19. That afternoon, children were still in classrooms and adults were still at work. People shook hands and hugged and kissed. In the evening, they went to pubs and restaurants. Some went on dates and others visited elderly relatives. They assembled in groups and mingled with residents of other households. As the weekend went on, football fans crammed into stadiums. Worshippers gathered in churches, mosques, temples and synagogues. You could go outside for as long as you liked, if you didn't mind the rain. On supermarket shelves, toilet paper and paracetamol were plentiful. Recent storms had left large swathes of the country flooded, but for most British people, life went on as it always had and seemingly always would. Insofar as any of this describes a British way of life, though, it was one that ceased to exist entirely within just a few weeks. The changes didn't happen smoothly, in steady, barely noticeable steps. Instead, the UK's sense of what was normal shifted in sudden movements, as though a ratchet was being yanked. On 28 February 2020 people in the UK were already taking notice of the outbreak. It would have been difficult to ignore entirely the headlines about what was happening in China, South Korea, Iran and Italy. The first confirmed cases among travellers returning to the UK had come as early as January, but it still seemed possible to regard this as something happening, for the most part, a long way away. Not every newspaper front page that Friday morning led with Covid-19 - the Daily Mail splashed on the saga of Harry and Meghan, the Daily Express with Brexit talks - but most did. In the final week of the month 442,675 phone calls were made to the non-emergency NHS line 111. People weren't yet panicking, but a generalised sense of low-level anxiety was everywhere. By 1 March, the virus had reached the four corners of the United Kingdom - cases had been detected in England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. Two days later, with the total number at 51, Prime Minister Boris Johnson stood behind a lectern and launched the government's Coronavirus Action Plan. The outbreak was declared a ""level four incident"". Up to a fifth of the workforce might be off sick at its peak, the prime ministerwarned. Schools might have to close and large-scale gatherings be reduced. However seriously anyone took the warning, it was still difficult to visualise. The following day, a woman in her 70s with an underlying condition - those last four words soon became grimly familiar to anyone who followed news bulletins - became the first person to die inside the UK after testing positive for the virus. The firstreports,externalof hand sanitiser selling out in supermarkets were published. Each day the number of confirmed cases crept up - 115 by 5 March, 206 by 7 March, 273 by 8 March. On 11 March, the day that the World Health Organization declared a pandemic, Liverpool FC hosted Atletico Madrid - who were already playing their home games behind closed doors. There were anxieties about whether it was a great idea to allow the 3,000 Spanish supporters to fly into a major British city where they would eat, drink, mingle and sleep. Anyone with plans to fly out of the UK was beginning to reconsider. Another twist of the ratchet was imminent. The following day, the government's Sage committee of scientific experts was shown revised modelling of the likely death toll. The figures,according to the Sunday Times,external, were ""shattering"". If nothing was done, there would be 510,000 deaths. Under the existing ""mitigation"" strategy - to shield the most vulnerable while letting everyone go about their business mostly as normal - there would be a quarter of a million. In a press conference, the prime minister told anyone with a continuous cough or a fever to self-isolate. His instruction came with a warning that ""many more families are going to lose loved ones before their time"". The bluntness was shocking. Some asked why, in that case, more wasn't being done. On Friday 13, the London Marathon, the Premier League and English Football League and May's local elections were all postponed. Scotland had its first coronavirus-related death. Saturday 14 and Sunday 15 March was the last relatively normal weekend. You couldn't watch league football but you could go to the pub. Hand sanitiser now wasn't to be found on any supermarket shelves, but you could tell your friends about your plans to practise ""social distancing"" if you met them on the street. Around the country, people looked at Italy, France and Spain, which had already gone into lockdown, and wondered if the UK was next. Volunteers began forming mutual aid groups to deliver food and medicine to vulnerable people who were self-isolating. In person and on WhatsApp, families and groups of friends argued about what it all meant. The more anxious wondered why the British government was moving more cautiously than its counterparts on the continent. The more blasÃ© complained about why they were going to all this bother. Wasn't it just a bit of flu? The latter sentiment was exactly the kind of thing the government's advisers were most worried about. On Monday 16, the prime minister advised against ""non-essential"" travel, urged people to avoid pubs and clubs and work from home. Across the country, kitchen tables were cleared to make way for laptops. Thanks to Skype and the virtual meetings app, Zoom, white-collar workers started getting a glimpse of their colleagues' interior decor. Those who couldn't do their jobs like this wondered how on Earth they were supposed to earn money and stay safe. On 17 March, the government began holding daily press conferences - events that would soon become regular viewing for nervous families. Just six days after presenting his budget, the Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, announced Â£300bn in loan guarantees - a huge expansion of state intervention in the economy by a Conservative government. There were still calls for more to be done to stop Britons infecting each other. The following day, most school pupils - those whose parents weren't designated key workers - were told they wouldn't go back to their classes until further notice. Exams, proms, farewells to classmates and teachers would now never happen. But although the UK had been told not to go to restaurants, cafes and pubs, many restaurants, cafes and pubs stayed open. They were quieter than usual but some customers still came. On the evening of Friday 20, the prime minister - who in a long career as a newspaper columnist had steadfastly demonstrated libertarian instincts - ordered restaurants, cafes and pubs to close, a measure that even in the darkest moments of World War Two would have been unthinkable. For much of the weekend that followed, there was bright sunshine, and people poured outside to take advantage of the last leisure option open to them. But when they crowded into parks and on to the summit of Snowdon they were seen - and widely condemned. This was not how ""social distancing"" - now regarded as everyone's social duty - was meant to operate. The lockdown was coming. On Monday 23 at 20:30, the television screens showed the prime minister sitting behind a desk. He was about to announce some of the most draconian restrictions on individual liberty the UK had ever seen. You could only leave home to exercise once a day, travel to and from work when absolutely necessary and only go shopping for essential items. You had to stand two metres apart from people you didn't live with. You weren't to gather in public in groups bigger than two. The British people were being told to avoid human contact when they needed it most. All through the following week, people would look forward to their one state-sanctioned form of outdoor exercise a day. Or they would stand in front of their laptops, following the instructions set by the fitness coach, Joe Wicks. By the time the weekend arrived, there were more than 537,000 confirmed cases in 175 countries. More than a quarter of all the people on the planet were living under some kind of restrictions in their social contact and movements. British life had been transformed so dramatically, and so fast, that you hadn't had time to dwell on it. On 28 February, London's Excel Centre had been hosting The Baby Show, ""the UK's largest parenting event"". A month later, the venue was a giant field hospital. This wasn't normal. Everything was described as ""unprecedented"" now, because it was. Speaking to the BBC's The World At One, historian Lord Peter Hennessy predicted that, in future, post-war Britain will be demarcated ""BC and AC - before corona and after corona"". Before 28 February, the UK was still widely portrayed as a place divided by Brexit, with younger, metropolitan Britons on one side, and their older counterparts in towns and the countryside on the other. That soon came to seem an anachronism. Elderly people were most at risk and those of working age, in the NHS and other key professions, were there to try and save them. Everyone was in this together. The framing of political debate since 2016 seemed inadequate to the new reality. Coronavirus would not be defeated by a populist attack on the elites. More than ever, the UK needed experts to lead the way. But the experts needed the masses, too - if the vast majority of the population didn't act, then Covid-19 couldn't be stopped. Initially, the lockdown was supposed to last three weeks. But a month on from 28 February, the UK is settling in for the long haul, with the prime minister, the health secretary and the first in line to the throne all having tested positive for the virus. You remember your last trip to the gym, the last drink you had in a cafe or a pub, the last time you hugged your mum or your grandad. You think about the life you once took for granted. You wonder if it will ever return. Follow@mrjonkelly,externalon Twitter Picture editor Emma Lynch A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms?

Wuhan partly reopens after coronavirus lockdown,"Many of those arriving in Wuhan on Saturday pulled suitcases behind them as they returned to their families The city in China where the coronavirus pandemic began, Wuhan, has partially re-opened after more than two months of isolation. Crowds of passengers were pictured arriving at Wuhan train station on Saturday. People are being allowed to enter but not leave, according to reports. Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province, saw more than 50,000 coronavirus cases. At least 3,000 people in Hubei died from the disease. But numbers have fallen dramatically, according to China's figures. On Saturday the province reported 54 new cases emerging the previous day - which it said were all imported. As it battles to control cases coming from abroad, China has announced a temporary ban on all foreign visitors, even if they have visas or residence permits. It is also limiting Chinese and foreign airlines to one flight per week, and flights must not be more than 75% full. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? AVOIDING CONTACT:Should I self-isolate?

'Coronavirus' crash man who hit nurse's car dies,"Nurse Lucy Duncan stayed with the patient after he had crashed into her car An elderly driver who was suspected of having coronavirus when he crashed into a nurse's car has died. The man was ""struggling to breathe"" when he hit Lucy Duncan's car as she drove home from a Wigan hospital. Ms Duncan, 24, called an ambulance when she found the man ""slumped over the wheel"" on Thursday and stayed with him in A&E for five hours. But earlier she told BBC Breakfast that the man, aged in his 70s, had died and she was now trying to trace his son. Ms Duncan, who had been returning from her seventh consecutive shift, said the man told her he had been in isolation for more than a week but felt forced to leave his home because he needed to buy food. ""He grabbed my arm and kept apologising, and said he thought he had coronavirus,"" she said on Friday. ""He was grey and sweating, and struggling to breathe.  So I called an ambulance and followed him in my own car, and stayed with him for five hours wearing full PPE. ""I don't think I did anything out of the ordinary but a lot of people have told me they wouldn't have done it."" Before his death, the man told Ms Duncan that he had a son, believed to be in Milton Keynes, whom he had not spoken to for many years. ""He asked me if I would help him get in touch with his son... it is going to be something I am going to try my hardest to do for him,"" she explained. The man was ""almost surprised when I kept going back to him [in the hospital]"". ""His eyes lit up every time I went back and held his hand. It was amazing to be part of his life."" Ms Duncan is now having to self-isolate in case she develops symptoms, with her family moving out of the house. ""It's a bit difficult at the moment because I am on my own and the first thing I wanted was a hug off my family after the night that I had,"" she said. ""But I suppose as a nurse, we're strong people and we learn to get through it."" LIVE:Latest updates from the BBC A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? AVOIDING CONTACT:Should I self-isolate?

UK wary of international market for ventilators,"Medical ventilators being constructed at the OES medical supply company in Witney A frenetic international market in ventilators and medical supplies has gathered pace in recent weeks as governments scramble to purchase equipment. Prices for equipment have been rocketing - often changing by the hour. The equipment is usually made in China and is then purchased by middlemen who offer it on. But the UK has so far tried to avoid purchasing from some of the intermediaries offering equipment. The market price for one particular type of ventilator increased in a week from $27,000 (Â£21,700) to $96,000 (Â£77,100) - a sign of just how intense the demand is. 'Mix-up' over EU ventilator scheme Government orders 10,000 ventilators from Dyson The British CEO of one company based in the Middle East has been repeatedly offering to sell equipment to the UK government since March 17. The company normally works in the defence sector but also deals in medical supplies. The inventory of available equipment changes daily but the offer has included ventilators, personal protective equipment masks and testing kit. A British-based contact of the supplier got in touch with Cabinet Office ministers and other officials through multiple channels, including MPs and other ministers, but the offer has not been taken up in London, leading to frustration that potentially life-saving kit which the NHS is in urgent need of, is being passed over. The contact said he was not seeking to profit from making the connection. UK government sources say they are procuring ventilators from abroad. As of 26 March, the government said more than 8,000 ventilators were available to NHS patients, with another 8,000 expected from existing UK and international manufacturers in the next few weeks. The government is opening a field hospital in London, which it says will initially hold 500 beds with ventilators A number of companies have been asked to make ventilators in the UK but it is unclear when they will be ready. The government has also said a mix-up meant it missed the deadline to join an EU scheme to obtain extra ventilators. Sources deny that red tape is holding up international procurement and say they are trying to procure directly from suppliers rather than through middlemen. It is thought there have been cases where offers have been made of equipment which turn out not to exist, or where multiple agents were offering the same items. There is also the concern that items might not meet the correct standards. Some testing kits purchased by countries, including Spain, have shown low levels of accuracy, making them unusable. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? AVOIDING CONTACT:Should I self-isolate? STRESS:How to protect your mental health LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak But other countries are engaging in this often chaotic and fast-moving market. Middle Eastern and North African countries have been purchasing from the Middle East-based supplier and the US has been offering to buy up large amounts of stocks at a premium over what others will pay. An Eastern European country recently upped the stakes by offering cash in advance. Some of the companies and individuals involved in this trade operate in the arms and defence industry, acting as intermediaries between manufacturers and militaries, others are new arrivals seeking to leverage contacts in China or elsewhere. An array of middlemen, fixers and consultants are often involved along the supply chain and some are likely to be adding huge price mark-ups on equipment they say they can get hold of in the current crisis. ""There are going to be some multi-millionaires made,"" said one person who works in this world.

"No time for complacency, says NHS England","This video can not be played NHS England's medical director Prof Stephen Powis: ""We can beat this virus... but now is not the time to be complacent"" ""Now is not the time to be complacent,"" NHS England medical director Stephen Powis has warned at the government's latest coronavirus press conference. Prof Powis said ""every one of us"" had a part to play if the UK was to keep the death toll under 20,000. Business Secretary Alok Sharma also announced changes to insolvency rules and the NHS supply chain. The number of people to have died with coronavirus in the UK has now reached 1,019. Mr Sharma said insolvency rules would be changed to allow firms greater flexibility as they faced the coronavirus crisis. He added that a range of measures to boost the supply of personal protective equipment, such as face masks to protect frontline NHS staff, were also being introduced. ""Red tape"" would be reduced to allow new producers of hand sanitiser to bring products to market ""in a matter of days"", he said. Number of UK coronavirus deaths rises above 1,000 Deserted London landmarks seen from above UK tourists in India complain of being 'abandoned' Prof Powis was also asked about the spread of the disease after a further 260 UK deaths in 24 hours. He replied: ""Clearly there has been a big increase in deaths today. ""If we can keep deaths below 20,000 we will have done very well in this epidemic,"" Prof Powis added,echoing comments from the government's chief scientific officerearlier in the month. He continued: ""It is early at the moment and the scientists who are working with the government to model what we can expect are of course adjusting their predictions now as we start to see the actuality of the epidemic in the UK, rather than what we believed might have happened a few weeks ago."" A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak STRESS:How to look after your mental health By BBC health reporter Philippa Roxby Despite today's news of the largest rise in people dying in the UK with Covid-19, the message is that everything we are all doing now to reduce social contact is having an impact - we just can't see it in the figures yet. That's because it takes time for the effects of not going out and not going to work to be felt in hospitals, where the most seriously ill are being tested and some are, sadly, dying. The epidemic is expected to peak in the UK in the next two to three weeks. Until then, it is likely the number of people confirmed to have the coronavirus and the number of people dying after testing positive for the virus will continue to grow at a similar pace - doubling every two or three days. The hope is that everyone's efforts now to stay at home and reduce the spread of this deadly virus will slow that growth rate at the right time, and, in time, bring it down. Every one of us now has a part to play in making that happen. This video can not be played Alok Sharma pledges to boost the supply of protective equipment for NHS staff Explaining the new measures to help businesses, Mr Sharma said he hoped the changes would help firms ""emerge intact the other side of the Covid-19 pandemic"". ""These measures will give those firms extra time and space to weather the storm and be ready when the crisis ends, while ensuring creditors get the best return possible in the circumstances,"" he said. The new rules will allow companies undergoing restructuring to continue to get access to supplies and raw materials. And, he said, there would be a temporary suspension of ""wrongful trading"" rules for company directors to remove the threat of personal liability during the pandemic, which will apply retrospectively from 1 March. We've seen the government announcing measures to give businesses access to cash in order to keep going over the past few weeks. Now it has turned to those that are facing insolvency. It has announced a temporary suspension of ""wrongful trading laws"", which stop company directors from being prosecuted for keeping a business going when it's insolvent or hasn't got a reasonable prospect of survival. The idea is to remove the fear bosses might have of trading through such turbulent and uncertain times and to give them breathing space. The chance to ""bounce back"", as the business secretary put it. However, much of the detail still needs fleshing out - such as how the government intends to keep suppliers working with companies that are in financial trouble. While business groups have welcomed the move, the trade association for the UK's insolvency industry, R3, believes this change could be open to abuse. All agree that this will stop a sudden spike in the number of companies going under - but in the long run it won't stop the collapse of businesses that fundamentally aren't viable. Asked how the prime minister - who is self-isolating with mild symptoms having tested positive for the virus - was getting on, Mr Sharma said he continued to lead the government's effort in combating Covid-19 ""This morning he held a video conference call and he will continue to lead right from the front on this."" He added that this showed why they were asking people to follow the government advice in terms of staying at home. The PM chaired the morning Covid-19 meeting via video-link as he self-isolates Earlier, it was announced frontline hospital staff in England werestarting to be tested to see whether they have coronavirus. Workers with symptoms and those who live with people who have symptoms will be checked - starting with hundreds of critical care doctors and nurses. Tests for A&E staff, paramedics and GPs are expected to follow, then social care staff. In Wales and Scotland, health workers are already being tested. Northern Ireland's testing begins on Monday. The British Medical Association said the move towards testing NHS staff in England was ""long overdue"", following concerns that healthy members of staff may have been self-isolating at home when they did not need to. The new tests being offered to frontline NHS staff are antigen tests, which indicate if someone is currently infected and risks spreading it to others. Another type of test, called the antibody test, could indicate whether someone has recently had the virus. It is not available to the public yet but Public Health England is ordering it in, for use once it is proven to work. In other developments: Secretary of State for Scotland, Alister Jack, is self-isolatingafter he developed coronavirus symptoms.

Who is allowed to go to work during 'lockdown'?,"This video can not be played Employees should not be left to 'anguish' over working The official advice is you should only travel to essential work if that cannot be done at home.  What is classed as ""essential work""? First Minister Nicola Sturgeon told MSPs it was not possible to provide ""bespoke guidance"" for each business but she gave some examples and general principles. ""It should not be up to employees to anguish over whether they should be going into work,"" Ms Sturgeon said If it is possible for a staff member to work from home, they should do so, she added. But if staff cannot work from home, employers should ask themselves whether their business is ""essential"" to the fight against coronavirus. That could include firms making medical supplies or essential items, or something essential to the wellbeing of the nation such as food supplies. Such businesses are asked to keep going ""if possible"". They are required to shut along with cafes, bars, restaurants, cinemas and gyms. The UK government has issued alist of ""essential"" retailers which are allowed to stay open,external. Supermarkets and pharmacies are among those on the list. Ms Sturgeon said key strategic sites that cannot easily be shut down such as steel works could continue to work if they can maintain safe distancing between staff, and safe operating numbers What is social distancing? In other businesses, employers should also ask themselves whether they can operate in line with safe social distancing practice and normal health and safety. If they cannot answer yes, they should close. This construction site at Larbert shut down on Tuesday The first minister said building sites should close, unless it involves an essential building such as a hospital. Ms Sturgeon said this may be reviewed in future if safe rules can be put in place but in the meantime they should shut as a precaution. People working alone, providing community services such as gardeners or window cleaners can continue to work. ""If they can go about their business safely this can be good for the community and we would encourage them to do so,"" said Ms Sturgeon. While the schools are closed, childcare will be provided by local authorities to families of some key workers. However the Scottish government wants to keep the number of children taking up these places to an ""absolute minimum"". Innew guidance issued on key workers,external, the government asked employers: to identify only staff ""absolutely necessary"" to deliver the Covid-19 response consider introducing new shift patterns, working from home, recruiting more staff or dropping non-essential staff discuss potential alternative childcare arrangements with employees, for example another parent who is not a key worker. Deputy First Minister John Swinney said: ""The priority [places] must be for children of the most critical key workers and for the most vulnerable children in our society."" ""I would urge employers to look at the guidance and consider if there is any way they can provide their essential services in a way that enables children to stay at home."" Earlier guidance issued to councils set out a broad definition of ""key workers"", set out in three categories. Health and care workers directly supporting Covid response, and associated staff Health and care workers supporting life threatening emergency work, as well as critical primary and community care provision Energy suppliers and staff providing childcare/learning for other category 1 staff. All other health and care workers, and wider public sector workers providing emergency/critical welfare services (e.g Fire, Police, Prisons, Social Workers, etc), Those supporting our critical national infrastructure, without whom serious damage to the welfare of the people of Scotland could be caused. All workers (private, public or third sector) without whom there could be a significant impact on Scotland (but where the response to Covid-19, or the ability to perform essential tasks to keep the country running, would not be severely compromised) Some councils have published more detailed lists of ""key workers"" for childcare purposes. North Lanarkshire Council,,externalfor example, says oil, gas, electricity and water and sewerage workers fall into category 2, while cemetery staff, waste management staff and payroll workers fall into category 3.

FA aims to complete WSL season by August,"Arsenal, who won the 2019 Women's Super League, are currently third behind leaders Manchester City and Chelsea The Football Association remains determined to complete the Women's Super League season - but wants the campaign concluded by early August. BBC Sport understands voiding the 2019-20 season was one of several options discussed over a conference call with club representatives on Friday. But no such decision was taken and consultations will continue while players and club staff are isolating. WSL bosses said the season will only resume if and when it is safe. Friday's conference call came afterThursday's announcementthat tiers three to seven of the women's game are to end their seasons immediately, with all results expunged. But bringing the top two divisions to the same abrupt conclusion has not emerged as the preferred choice of the WSL and Championship, which are run by the FA. The leagues will recommence no earlier than 30 April because of the coronavirus pandemic, but a 12-week period of isolation is considered likely. WSL clubs have between six and nine matches remaining this season, depending on games in hand, meaning the campaign will need to have resumed by mid-July in order to finish by the cut-off that has been set by the FA. Coronavirus: What next for football as cracks begin to appear? Before elite football across England was suspended earlier in March, the title race in the WSL was far less clear cut than that of the men's top flight, where Liverpool have a 25-point lead. Manchester City lead the WSL by one point, but second-placed Chelsea have a game in hand. The Blues have taken four points from their two league matches against City and maximum points from their fixtures against third-placed Arsenal, who are three points further back and also have a game in hand on City. At the bottom, Liverpool occupy the only relegation spot but are only one point adrift of 11th-placed Birmingham City. Unbeaten Aston Villa are six points clear at the top of the Women's Championship and look on course to secure promotion. Friday's conference call was exclusively designed to discuss the future of the WSL and Women's Championship, with any decisions taken having no bearing on the men's game. Like the top two tiers of women's football, all Premier League and English Football League games have been suspended until at least 30 April. It remains unclear how or when the season will be concluded, although some managers have said the campaign must be played to a finish to preserve the""integrity of the game"". Queens Park Rangers boss Mark Warburton said that even if it took until the end of the year to complete the season that would be the right thing to do. In a joint statement issued on Friday, the Premier League, EFL and Professional Footballers' Association said""difficult decisions will have to be taken""to counter the financial impact of coronavirus.

"Number of UK coronavirus deaths rises above 1,000","The number of people to have died with the coronavirus in the UK has reached 1,019. The latest government figures,externalon Saturday showed there were another 260 deaths in the UK in a day, up from 759 on Friday. There are now 17,089 confirmed cases in the UK. It comes as the government said it was ramping up testing for frontline hospital staff who have symptoms, or who live with people who have symptoms. Critical care doctors and nurses will be prioritised first, with testing expected to follow for A&E staff, paramedics and GPs. In Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, health workers are already being tested. How fast is the coronavirus growing in the UK? How to understand the number of coronavirus deaths UK tourists in India complain of being 'abandoned' The jump in deaths is the biggest day-on-day increase the UK since the outbreak began. The number of deaths is 34% higher than Friday's figure. The new figures include a further 246 people in England, with patients aged between 33 and 100 years old. All of them had underlying health conditions except 13 people, who were aged 63 and over. In Scotland, 40 people have died so far in total, while the figure in Wales is 38. Northern Ireland has seen a total of 15 deaths. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do i protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak STRESS:How to look after your mental health The Department of Health and Social Care also corrected figures that it shared on Friday, saying the number of confirmed cases was 36 fewer than it had tweeted, at 14,543. Among the latest public figures to announce they have tested positive for the virus isScottish Secretary Alister Jack,who is self-isolating. Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Health Secretary Matt Hancock are self-isolatingafter testing positive for the virus. England's chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, is also self-isolating, but has not tested positive. Former Cabinet Secretary Gus O'Donnell said politicians needed to ""obey their own rules much more strictly"" on social distancing. In other developments: The car park of Chessington World of Adventures in Chessington has become a temporary drive through testing station for NHS workers Photos showed work under way to turn London's ExCel centre into a temporary hospital with capacity for 4,000 people Two new temporary hospitals will be set up in Birmingham and Manchesterto help the NHS cope with the virus County councils are warning residents some services, such as recycling centres and adult education centres, will be significantly scaled back or stopped to prioritise keeping people safe from coronavirus The Local Government Association says council workers are being physically and verbally abused for implementing the government's social distancing policy. Workers have been spat at, sworn at and racially abused, it said The Mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, said he had received about 300 complaints from employees and the public about businesses not following social distancing guidelines. The HCSA hospital doctors' union said potential supply issues should not delay thereported introduction of more stringent guidanceon the use of personal protective equipment by frontline NHS staff. The total number of people tested for the virus in the UK was 120,776, as of Saturday morning. Currently, about 6,000 people are tested daily, but the government wants to increase that number to 10,000 a day by the end of March and 25,000 a day by mid-April. Contractors and members of the military have been building the Nightingale Hospital at the Excel centre in London The British Medical Association said the move towards testing NHS staff in England was ""long overdue"", following concerns that healthy members of staff may have been self-isolating at home when they did not need to. The new tests being offered to frontline NHS staff - and which have already been used to check very ill patients in hospitals - are antigen tests, which indicate if someone is currently infected and risks spreading it to others. Another type of test, called the antibody test, indicates whether someone has recently had the virus. It is not available to the public yet but Public Health England is ordering it in. Over the weekend, the first of three new testing labs are expected to start work to process 800 samples, the government said. Samples will be taken around the country, initially focusing on coronavirus hotspots such as London. Dozens of universities, research institutes and companies are lending equipment for the labs.

"Trump signs largest bailout in US historyThe $2 trillion boost is the largest ever as virus cases continue to rise, hitting the economy.US & Canada","Democratic US Representatives practise social distancing as they discuss the stimulus bill President Trump has signed the largest-ever US financial stimulus package, worth $2tn (Â£1.7tn), as the country grapples with the coronavirus pandemic. The House of Representatives passed the cross-party bill two days after the Senate debated its provisions. On Wednesday the number of Americans filing for unemployment surged to a record high of 3.3 million people. The US has more confirmed cases of coronavirus than any other country, with more than 143,500 positive tests. No Democratic lawmakers were invited to the historic signing ceremony, which was held at the White House, though the president thanked both parties ""for coming together, setting aside their differences and putting America first"". Mr Trump said the package was ""twice as large"" as any prior relief bill. ""This will deliver urgently needed relief to our nation's families, workers and businesses,"" he said. Just before signing the act into law, Mr Trump invoked the Defence Production Act (DPA), which gives the president the power to force private industries to create items required for national defence. Mr Trump said the order will compel General Motors (GM) to manufacture much-needed medical ventilators for the federal government. Earlier in the day, Mr Trump tweeted that GM had promised to ""give us 40,000 much needed Ventilators, 'very quickly'. This video can not be played Coronavirus: Lack of medical supplies 'a national shame' ""Now they are saying it will only be 6,000, in late April, and they want top dollar,"" he said, threatening to invoke the DPA. During the bill signing, the president said that ""tremendous [medical] supplies"" would be coming soon, adding: ""We've had great results on just about everything we're talking about."" Earlier on Friday, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced eight temporary hospitals to meet an expected surge in cases. Coronavirus updates from around the world At least 965 people have died in the state - the worst-hit in the US - with 59,568 confirmed cases. Democrats and Republicans in the Democratic-led House approved the stimulus package by voice vote on Friday following a three-hour debate. ""Our nation faces an economic and health emergency of historic proportions due to the coronavirus pandemic, the worst pandemic in over 100 years,"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said. Members of the House had been ready to conduct the vote at their homes but were forced to return to Washington at the last minute after a Republican representative from Kentucky demanded a quorum of half the chamber be present. Thomas Massie - who objected to the stimulus package saying it contained too much spending - also sought to delay proceedings by demanding a formal recorded vote, as opposed to a voice vote, but was overruled. Mr Trump vented his fury at Mr Massie on Twitter, calling him a ""third-rate grandstander"" and demanding he be thrown out of the Republican party. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? AVOIDING CONTACT:Should I self-isolate? STRESS:How to protect your mental health VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash The new law enables direct payments to individuals and companies whose livelihoods and businesses have been affected by the pandemic. It seeks to deliver $1,200 to every American earning less than $75,000 per year and $500 per child. It also gives money to directly to state governments, and bolsters the unemployment benefits programme. Under the law, jobless benefits will be extended to those not normally covered, such as freelancers and workers in the gig economy. This video can not be played Coronavirus: Millions of Americans unemployed The bill also offers loans and tax breaks to companies that face going out of business, as one in every four Americans is ordered to remain at home and only go outside for essential needs. Officials across the US have closed restaurants, bars, cinemas, hotels and gyms in an effort to slow the spread of the virus. Car firms have halted production and air travel has fallen dramatically. According to economists, a fifth of the US workforce is on some form of lockdown. With almost 1,500 virus-related fatalities, the US death toll remains lower than those in Italy and China. But there are virus hotspots in New York, New Orleans and Detroit. Mr Cuomo said in any ""realistic scenario"" cases of people seriously ill from the virus would overwhelm New York's healthcare system.

Governor John Bel Edwards said New Orleans would run out of ventilators by 2 April and possibly run out of hospital beds by 7 April if the number of new infections did not subside. ""It's not some flimsy theory. This is what is going to happen,"" he said. Medical staff across the country are also reporting shortages of personal protective equipment. Earlier on Friday World Health Organization chief Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said a ""chronic global shortage"" of protective equipment was one of the ""most urgent threats"" to the ability to save lives. On Thursday Vice-President Mike Pence said coronavirus tests were now available in all 50 states and more than 552,000 tests had been conducted nationwide. Mr Trump had set a much-criticised goal of Easter Sunday, 12 April, for reopening the country.

UK wary of international market for ventilatorsThe UK is avoiding buying from middlemen as prices rocket amid feverish global trading conditions.,"Medical ventilators being constructed at the OES medical supply company in Witney A frenetic international market in ventilators and medical supplies has gathered pace in recent weeks as governments scramble to purchase equipment. Prices for equipment have been rocketing - often changing by the hour. The equipment is usually made in China and is then purchased by middlemen who offer it on. But the UK has so far tried to avoid purchasing from some of the intermediaries offering equipment. The market price for one particular type of ventilator increased in a week from $27,000 (Â£21,700) to $96,000 (Â£77,100) - a sign of just how intense the demand is. 'Mix-up' over EU ventilator scheme Government orders 10,000 ventilators from Dyson The British CEO of one company based in the Middle East has been repeatedly offering to sell equipment to the UK government since March 17. The company normally works in the defence sector but also deals in medical supplies. The inventory of available equipment changes daily but the offer has included ventilators, personal protective equipment masks and testing kit. A British-based contact of the supplier got in touch with Cabinet Office ministers and other officials through multiple channels, including MPs and other ministers, but the offer has not been taken up in London, leading to frustration that potentially life-saving kit which the NHS is in urgent need of, is being passed over. The contact said he was not seeking to profit from making the connection. UK government sources say they are procuring ventilators from abroad. As of 26 March, the government said more than 8,000 ventilators were available to NHS patients, with another 8,000 expected from existing UK and international manufacturers in the next few weeks. The government is opening a field hospital in London, which it says will initially hold 500 beds with ventilators A number of companies have been asked to make ventilators in the UK but it is unclear when they will be ready. The government has also said a mix-up meant it missed the deadline to join an EU scheme to obtain extra ventilators. Sources deny that red tape is holding up international procurement and say they are trying to procure directly from suppliers rather than through middlemen. It is thought there have been cases where offers have been made of equipment which turn out not to exist, or where multiple agents were offering the same items. There is also the concern that items might not meet the correct standards. Some testing kits purchased by countries, including Spain, have shown low levels of accuracy, making them unusable. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? AVOIDING CONTACT:Should I self-isolate? STRESS:How to protect your mental health LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak But other countries are engaging in this often chaotic and fast-moving market. Middle Eastern and North African countries have been purchasing from the Middle East-based supplier and the US has been offering to buy up large amounts of stocks at a premium over what others will pay. An Eastern European country recently upped the stakes by offering cash in advance. Some of the companies and individuals involved in this trade operate in the arms and defence industry, acting as intermediaries between manufacturers and militaries, others are new arrivals seeking to leverage contacts in China or elsewhere. An array of middlemen, fixers and consultants are often involved along the supply chain and some are likely to be adding huge price mark-ups on equipment they say they can get hold of in the current crisis. ""There are going to be some multi-millionaires made,"" said one person who works in this world.

What do we know about the Scottish Secretary Alister Jack?,"Alister Jack is the new Scottish Secretary, taking over the job after David Mundell was sacked by new Prime Minister Boris Johnson. What do we know about the Dumfries and Galloway MP? Alister Jack is a relative newcomer to Westminster, having been first elected in the 2017 snap election. He represents his local seat, having been born in Dumfries in 1963. He was raised in Dalbeattie and Kippford, and went to the independent boarding school Glenalmond College in Perthshire. A successful businessman, he founded a series of self-storage companies which he sold in dealssaid to be worth tens of millions of pounds,external. He also runs a large dairy farm near his home in Dumfries, and grows Christmas trees. Johnson sacks Mundell as Scottish secretary Mr Jack has been part of the Scottish Conservative Party for decades, having acted as its industry and economy spokesman from 1996. In 1997 he contested the Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale seat for the Tories. He came third behind another future Scottish Secretary, Lib Dem Michael Moore, but went on to become vice-chairman of the Scottish party anyway. He finally made it into parliament 20 years later, taking the Dumfries and Galloway seat from the SNP's Richard Arkless in 2017. He won with a majority of 10.9%, one of a dozen new Scottish Conservative MPs to be elected that year. He said he was ""proud"" to have been chosen to represent his local area, which he said ""captures the hearts of all who live there and all who visit"". Alister Jack took his hometown seat from the SNP in 2017 Mr Jack quickly rose through the internal Tory ranks during his first two years at Westminster, first acting as an aide to the Leader of the House of Lords and then rising through the whips office to become Lord Commissioner of the Treasury. He voted Leave in the 2016 EU referendum, and said the UK had ""a unique opportunity to create a bright future for our country as an independent free trading nation"". As a whip he did not make many public statements on Brexit - or indeed who he was backing in the leadership contest. However he voted for Theresa May's dealafter seeking assurancesfrom the then-prime minister over its implications for the integrity of the UK union, saying it was ""time to get on and make it happen"". Outside of politics, he is married and has three grown-up children. He is a Deputy Lieutenant for Dumfries, and a member of the Royal Company of Archers, the Queen's official bodyguard unit in Scotland.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Health Secretary Matt Hancock are self-isolatingafter testing positive for the virus. England's chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, is also self-isolating, but has not tested positive.

The HCSA hospital doctors' union said potential supply issues should not delay thereported introduction of more stringent guidanceon the use of personal protective equipment by frontline NHS staff. The total number of people tested for the virus in the UK was 120,776, as of Saturday morning. Currently, about 6,000 people are tested daily, but the government wants to increase that number to 10,000 a day by the end of March and 25,000 a day by mid-April. Contractors and members of the military have been building the Nightingale Hospital at the Excel centre in London The British Medical Association said the move towards testing NHS staff in England was ""long overdue"", following concerns that healthy members of staff may have been self-isolating at home when they did not need to. The new tests being offered to frontline NHS staff - and which have already been used to check very ill patients in hospitals - are antigen tests, which indicate if someone is currently infected and risks spreading it to others. Another type of test, called the antibody test, indicates whether someone has recently had the virus. It is not available to the public yet but Public Health England is ordering it in. Over the weekend, the first of three new testing labs are expected to start work to process 800 samples, the government said. Samples will be taken around the country, initially focusing on coronavirus hotspots such as London. Dozens of universities, research institutes and companies are lending equipment for the labs.

India defiant as millions struggle under lockdownThe government defends strict lockdown measures that have left millions stranded and without food.India,"This video can not be played Millions of people in India are struggling for food during the country's coronavirus lockdown The Indian government has defended its handling of the coronavirus outbreak after a strict lockdown - introduced with little warning - left millions stranded and without food. The country's response had been ""pre-emptive, pro-active and graded"", it said in a statement. India's population of 1.3 billion was given less than four hours' notice of the three-week lockdown on Tuesday. Officially about 900 people have coronavirus in India. However, experts worry that the real number of infections could be far higher. India has one of the lowest testing rates in the world, although efforts are under way to ramp up capacity. There are fears that an outbreak in the country - one of the world's most densely populated - could result in a catastrophe. So far 20 people are reported to have died. Migrant workers have been queuing in their thousands as they try to get home to their villages People are banned from leaving their homes under the ""total lockdown"" measures. All non-essential businesses have been closed and almost all public gatherings are banned. But there have been reports of long queues and panic buying as people struggle to get supplies. After the lockdown was announced, people in Delhi and the financial capital, Mumbai, quickly thronged shops and pharmacies amid fears of shortages. It prompted Prime Minister Narendra Modi to warn that panic buying would only spread the disease. He said the government would ensure there were sufficient supplies. Meanwhile, millions have been left jobless and without money as a result of the shutdown. It has sparked an exodus from major cities such as Delhi, where thousands of migrant workers are setting out on long journeys back to their home villages after transport was stopped. One worker died on Saturday after he attempted to walk a 168 mile (270km) journey back home, a police officials told Reuters news agency. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms?

The government had already put in place a ""comprehensive response system"" at its borders before the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the coronavirus a public health emergency of international concern on 30 January, it added. Several state governments have promised cash handouts to migrant workers, but there are concerns about the logistics of delivering the aid. Uttar Pradesh in the north is also putting on buses to help those who have been left stranded. Police are enforcing the 21-day lockdown Meanwhile, the virus continues to spread rapidly in other countries around the world. The city in China where the coronavirus pandemic began,Wuhan, has partially re-opened after more than two months of isolation.  People are being allowed to enter but not leave, according to reports. More than 600,000 infections have been confirmed globally and over 30,000 deaths, according to figures collated by Johns Hopkins University The death toll in Spain has exceeded 5,000, after it reported 832 more fatalities in the past 24 hours. Spain is the world's worst hit country after Italy The US now has the highest number of confirmed infections at 104,000 South Korea says that for the first time it now has more people who have recovered from the virus than are still infected.

Virus testing rolled out for frontline NHS staff,"Staff at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff carrying out a diagnostic test for coronavirus earlier this month Frontline hospital staff in England are starting to be tested to see whether they have coronavirus. Workers with symptoms and those who live with people who have symptoms will be checked - starting with hundreds of critical care doctors and nurses. Tests for A&E staff, paramedics and GPs are expected to follow, and later social care staff will be tested. It comes as the number of people who have died with the virus in the UK rose by 260 to 1,019 on Saturday. Latest government figures show,externalthere are now 17,089 confirmed cases in the UK. In Wales and Scotland, health workers are already being tested, while Northern Ireland's testing begins on Monday. Until now, only patients in English hospitals with flu-like symptoms were being routinely tested but this had led to concerns that without testing, many health and care workers would not know whether they were safe to return to work. Meanwhile, Scottish Secretary Alister Jackis the latest politicianto announce he is self-isolating after showing mild symptoms.

'Stay local to exercise',"The government has said people should ""stay local"" and not travel unnecessarily for exercise. New advice clarifies that people should use ""open spaces"",externalnear to home, where possible. It follows confusion over whether people could drive somewhere to go walking, running, or cycling. Exercise is one of the few defined reasons that people in the UK are allowed to leave their home during the coronavirus pandemic. Derbyshire Police sparked a heated debate on Twitter this week when it shared drone footage of people walking in the Peak District,external, with a warning that daily exercise should not involve long trips or journeys in the car.

Some Twitter users argued that those in the footage were not in the wrong as they were keeping apart from other people, while others classed driving to places as unnecessary. The prime minister, whohas tested positive for coronavirus, said on Monday thatpeople can take ""one form of exercise a day"",external- either on their own or with people they live with. The government'sofficial guidelines list running, walking and cycling,externalas examples. But the initial guidelines did not advise if, or how far, people could travel in order to exercise. While the new advice does go further, it does not explicitly define what counts as ""local"", and whether or not people can use cars. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? AVOIDING CONTACT:Should I self-isolate? STRESS:How to protect your mental health LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak Mike, 53, from Lancashire, had to put the mountain biking festival he usually runs on hold this summer because of the pandemic - but still takes his bike out for rides on the Yorkshire Moors. His house is a short cycle away, but a busy road means that he is unable to take his five-year-old with him. ""I don't want him riding up and down the main road outside our house, he's not quite ready for that yet,"" he told the BBC. This video can not be played 'Do you want to say my Coronavirus contribution was a fine?' - police warning ""But I know if I put his bike in the boot of my car and drive for half a mile, there are lots of countryside trails where he can ride safely along with me."" The RAC said before the release of the latest goverment advice that people shouldn't drive places to exercise,external, recommending instead that they use their gardens - where possible - or leave home ""on foot or by bike"". Bakewell Police issued a picture of a note left by a local on a car parked in the Peak District Superintendent Steve Pont, of Derbyshire Police, echoed this advice in an interview with the BBC's Today programme. ""Every time you're out in public, away from your home, there's a possibility you might catch or pass on the virus,"" he said. He added that unnecessary trips in the car or walks along cliff tops could lead to accidents, and put emergency service workers at risk. Mountain Rescue has also urged people to,external""stay local"" and avoid travel ""unless it's essential"". Steve Lyons, 62, from Chippenham in Wiltshire, said that, initially, he could not work out what those people in the video posted by Derbyshire Police were doing wrong. Steve and Karen Lyons usually walk alongside a canal but now opt for walks in town ""In an ideal world you get in the car, you drive to somewhere nice, you go for a walk, and you drive home again,"" he said. ""But there will be instances where somebody gets hurt, somebody injures themselves walking, or a car breaks down... Are you putting people unnecessarily at risk who might have to come and recover you?"" He and his wife usually drive to a spot by a canal to go walking, but are now opting for walks in town instead. He said that even in London it is ""not impossible to get out your front door"" and walk somewhere apart from other people. However, Rose Drew, who is in her 50s and lives in York, said travelling by car enables her to get fresh air with her daughter, who has a disability. Rose Drew: ""How crowded can the Moors get? It's virtually impossible"" She thinks that maintaining a connection with nature is important for environmental and mental health reasons. ""Not everyone can get out to the countryside,"" she said, adding that people who live in cities ""don't want to walk around on concrete"" but might have cars to travel. ""How crowded can the Moors get? It's virtually impossible,"" she added. For Mike, too, exercise in open spaces is important for people's mental and physical health - and he said that staying healthy alleviates pressure on the NHS in its own way. But he thinks the guidance from the government on driving had ""not been as clear as it could be"". ""I think to simply say you cannot drive your car, get out of that car and take a walk seems to be going too far,"" he said. What are the social distancing rules?

You should stay at home if possible, not leave it for any reason, other than to exercise (staying a safe distance from others). This is known asself-isolation.

"Spain sees surge in cases as UK deaths top 1,000","If UK death toll is kept below 20,000, ""we will have done very well"" - NHS England medical director Prof Stephen Powis Across the UK, 1,019 people have now died Wuhan, the city where the coronavirus pandemic began, has partially re-opened after two months of isolation US President Donald Trump says he is considering quarantining New York and other hotspots Spain's coronavirus death toll rose by 832 cases overnight to 5,690 It marked a new high in the daily rise in fatalities in Spain South Korea says for the first time it has more people who have recovered than are infected George Wright, Ashitha Nagesh, Max Matza, Deirdre Finnerty and Helier Cheung A family arriving in Wuhan on Saturday as public transport resumes service We're pausing our live coverage for now, but we'll be back with the latest coronavirus updates from tomorrow morning. A lot has happened today, so here's a quick recap: Earlier today, President Trump said he was considering imposing a quarantine on New York, and parts of New Jersey and Connecticut, to slow the spread of coronavirus. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has responded by saying that the ""quarantine"" is already happening in his state, which has banned major gatherings and ordered people to remain at home. However, Mr Cuomo said he would oppose any effort to ""lockdown"" his state. ""If you said we were geographically restricted from leaving, that would be a lockdown,"" he told CNN. ""Then we would be Wuhan, China, and that wouldnât make any sense,"" he said, adding that this would cause the stock market to crash in a way that would make it impossible for the US economy to ""recover for months, if not years"". ""You would paralyse the financial sector,"" he added, calling it the opposite of Mr Trump's hope to quickly jumpstart the US economy. ""It's a preposterous idea, frankly,"" he said, adding it would be ""anti-American"" and a ""declaration of war"" on states by the federal government. It is not clear whether Mr Trump could close state borders. While the president does have sweeping powers, especially during a national emergency, it is the role of state and local governments to take the lead in preventing the spread of disease. Mr Cuomo also said that he plans to sue Rhode Island if they continue targeting New Yorkers to threaten them with punishment if they do not quarantine. That state's governor has mobilised soldiers to seek out fleeing New Yorkers. People should prepare to fight coronavirus like they would prepare for surgery by staying fit and healthy - that's according to medics at the Centre for Perioperative Care (CPOC). They suggest a healthy diet, exercise, alcohol-free days and quitting smoking will reduce the risk of becoming severely ill with the virus and ending up in intensive care.

Earlier today Spain announced its total number of deaths had reached 5,690. Philippa RoxbyHealth reporter, BBC News Despite today's news of the largest rise in people dying in the UK with Covid-19, the message is that everything we are all doing now to reduce social contact is having an impact.

Until then, it is likely the number of people confirmed to have the coronavirus and the number of people dying after testing positive for the virus will continue to grow at a similar pace - doubling every two or three days.

Spain suffers surge in virus cases and deaths,"If UK death toll is kept below 20,000, ""we will have done very well"" - NHS England medical director Prof Stephen Powis Across the UK, 1,019 people have now died Wuhan, the city where the coronavirus pandemic began, has partially re-opened after two months of isolation US President Donald Trump says he is considering quarantining New York and other hotspots Spain's coronavirus death toll rose by 832 cases overnight to 5,690 It marked a new high in the daily rise in fatalities in Spain South Korea says for the first time it has more people who have recovered than are infected George Wright, Ashitha Nagesh, Max Matza, Deirdre Finnerty and Helier Cheung A family arriving in Wuhan on Saturday as public transport resumes service We're pausing our live coverage for now, but we'll be back with the latest coronavirus updates from tomorrow morning. A lot has happened today, so here's a quick recap: Earlier today, President Trump said he was considering imposing a quarantine on New York, and parts of New Jersey and Connecticut, to slow the spread of coronavirus. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has responded by saying that the ""quarantine"" is already happening in his state, which has banned major gatherings and ordered people to remain at home. However, Mr Cuomo said he would oppose any effort to ""lockdown"" his state. ""If you said we were geographically restricted from leaving, that would be a lockdown,"" he told CNN. ""Then we would be Wuhan, China, and that wouldnât make any sense,"" he said, adding that this would cause the stock market to crash in a way that would make it impossible for the US economy to ""recover for months, if not years"". ""You would paralyse the financial sector,"" he added, calling it the opposite of Mr Trump's hope to quickly jumpstart the US economy. ""It's a preposterous idea, frankly,"" he said, adding it would be ""anti-American"" and a ""declaration of war"" on states by the federal government. It is not clear whether Mr Trump could close state borders. While the president does have sweeping powers, especially during a national emergency, it is the role of state and local governments to take the lead in preventing the spread of disease. Mr Cuomo also said that he plans to sue Rhode Island if they continue targeting New Yorkers to threaten them with punishment if they do not quarantine. That state's governor has mobilised soldiers to seek out fleeing New Yorkers. People should prepare to fight coronavirus like they would prepare for surgery by staying fit and healthy - that's according to medics at the Centre for Perioperative Care (CPOC). They suggest a healthy diet, exercise, alcohol-free days and quitting smoking will reduce the risk of becoming severely ill with the virus and ending up in intensive care. CPOC deputy director Scarlett McNally said there has been ""a lot of very important advice"" on how to cut the risk of becoming infected, but there was ""little on the importance of preparing in case the virus is contracted"".

The latest government figures,externalon Saturday showed there were another 260 deaths in the UK in a day, up from 759 on Friday. There are now 17,089 confirmed cases in the UK. It comes as the government said it was ramping up testing for frontline hospital staff who have symptoms, or who live with people who have symptoms. Critical care doctors and nurses will be prioritised first, with testing expected to follow for A&E staff, paramedics and GPs. In Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, health workers are already being tested. How fast is the coronavirus growing in the UK? How to understand the number of coronavirus deaths UK tourists in India complain of being 'abandoned' The jump in deaths is the biggest day-on-day increase the UK since the outbreak began. The number of deaths is 34% higher than Friday's figure. The new figures include a further 246 people in England, with patients aged between 33 and 100 years old. All of them had underlying health conditions except 13 people, who were aged 63 and over. In Scotland, 40 people have died so far in total, while the figure in Wales is 38.

Among the latest public figures to announce they have tested positive for the virus isScottish Secretary Alister Jack,who is self-isolating. Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Health Secretary Matt Hancock are self-isolatingafter testing positive for the virus. England's chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, is also self-isolating, but has not tested positive. Former Cabinet Secretary Gus O'Donnell said politicians needed to ""obey their own rules much more strictly"" on social distancing.

Workers have been spat at, sworn at and racially abused, it said The Mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, said he had received about 300 complaints from employees and the public about businesses not following social distancing guidelines. The HCSA hospital doctors' union said potential supply issues should not delay thereported introduction of more stringent guidanceon the use of personal protective equipment by frontline NHS staff. The total number of people tested for the virus in the UK was 120,776, as of Saturday morning. Currently, about 6,000 people are tested daily, but the government wants to increase that number to 10,000 a day by the end of March and 25,000 a day by mid-April. Contractors and members of the military have been building the Nightingale Hospital at the Excel centre in London The British Medical Association said the move towards testing NHS staff in England was ""long overdue"", following concerns that healthy members of staff may have been self-isolating at home when they did not need to. The new tests being offered to frontline NHS staff - and which have already been used to check very ill patients in hospitals - are antigen tests, which indicate if someone is currently infected and risks spreading it to others. Another type of test, called the antibody test, indicates whether someone has recently had the virus. It is not available to the public yet but Public Health England is ordering it in. Over the weekend, the first of three new testing labs are expected to start work to process 800 samples, the government said. Samples will be taken around the country, initially focusing on coronavirus hotspots such as London. Dozens of universities, research institutes and companies are lending equipment for the labs.

"Russia sees no epidemic but starts shutdownRussia begins a ""non-working week"" to try to slow the spread of coronavirus.Europe","Parks are closing across the country but many Russians are not sure what all the fuss is about Russia is beginning what Vladimir Putin called a ""non-working week"", to try to slow the spread of the coronavirus. The government is urging people to stay at home, though mixed messaging has left many Russians confused. Officials now hint the new restrictions could be extended beyond 5 April, depending on the health situation. The number of Russians infected with Covid-19 passed 1,000 on Friday, with most cases detected in Moscow. Based on that figure, the Kremlin spokesman has stressed that there is ""de facto no epidemic"" here, comparing Russia's position favourably with the crisis in Europe. And whilst state TV's rolling news channel has changed its name to We're Staying Home - broadcasting from presenters' living rooms - many people are struggling to adjust after its previous insistence that Covid-19 was a ""foreign threat"". This video can not be played Vladimir Putin visited a Moscow hospital for coronavirus patients So when Mr Putin announced a paid week off work for all, there was a rush to book holidays. The governor of Krasnodar region, which includes the Black Sea resort of Sochi, had to order the closure of all shopping centres, parks and restaurants - and limit flights - after hotel reservations sky-rocketed. ""This is not a week of extra leave or holiday,"" explained Benjamin Kondratiev on Instagram, clarifying the president's speech. He added his own call for ""self-discipline"" to get through what he called the ""bad period"" of coronavirus. Many Muscovites have already headed out of town to their dachas, or summer houses. More Muscovites have been wearing face masks in recent days In Moscow, there has been a noticeable increase in people in facemasks on the streets since Mr Putin's national address. Supermarket staff have begun wearing them and there are bottles of hand sanitiser in coffee shops. Virus delays Russia vote on Putin staying in power Russian clerics raise eyebrows over coronavirus Food shops will remain open, as well as other essential services, but from this weekend cafes and restaurants can offer takeaway only. At one popular coffee chain, a barista who's now selling drinks through a window said coronavirus was the only topic of conversation these days, and that people were worried. This barista is selling fresh coffee from a window but Moscow's economy is already being hit Her own hours have been cut; in other sectors, people are already being laid-off. Still, some Muscovites can't understand what the fuss is about. ""There's deaths from cancer and other diseases all the time and people still go to work, take the metro or go to the park,"" Dmitry shrugged, the day before the bicycle-hire shop he works at was closed. ""I'll definitely be going out on the streets this week,"" he said. ""The weather's great!"" Muscovites have been out enjoying the spring sunshine A Latvian man passing with a pushchair was less positive. ""I think these measures are late,"" Krist said, on a break from remote-working. ""Look at Italy and Spain. People were out and about there, too, and now things are scary."" Gorky Park, nearby, has already been locked shut for two days. ""We did as we were told,"" a security guard said through the fence. ""I'm not sure how long it will go on for."" The Kremlin says the new restrictions are for a week, ""for now"", although in Moscow people over 65 have already been told to stay inside until mid-April. The mayor cancelled their free transport passes, just in case any were tempted to test the new rules. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? AVOIDING CONTACT:Should I self-isolate?

FA aims to complete WSL season by AugustThe Football Association remains determined to complete the Women's Super League season - but wants it finished by early August.,"Arsenal, who won the 2019 Women's Super League, are currently third behind leaders Manchester City and Chelsea The Football Association remains determined to complete the Women's Super League season - but wants the campaign concluded by early August. BBC Sport understands voiding the 2019-20 season was one of several options discussed over a conference call with club representatives on Friday. But no such decision was taken and consultations will continue while players and club staff are isolating. WSL bosses said the season will only resume if and when it is safe. Friday's conference call came afterThursday's announcementthat tiers three to seven of the women's game are to end their seasons immediately, with all results expunged. But bringing the top two divisions to the same abrupt conclusion has not emerged as the preferred choice of the WSL and Championship, which are run by the FA. The leagues will recommence no earlier than 30 April because of the coronavirus pandemic, but a 12-week period of isolation is considered likely. WSL clubs have between six and nine matches remaining this season, depending on games in hand, meaning the campaign will need to have resumed by mid-July in order to finish by the cut-off that has been set by the FA. Coronavirus: What next for football as cracks begin to appear? Before elite football across England was suspended earlier in March, the title race in the WSL was far less clear cut than that of the men's top flight, where Liverpool have a 25-point lead. Manchester City lead the WSL by one point, but second-placed Chelsea have a game in hand. The Blues have taken four points from their two league matches against City and maximum points from their fixtures against third-placed Arsenal, who are three points further back and also have a game in hand on City. At the bottom, Liverpool occupy the only relegation spot but are only one point adrift of 11th-placed Birmingham City. Unbeaten Aston Villa are six points clear at the top of the Women's Championship and look on course to secure promotion. Friday's conference call was exclusively designed to discuss the future of the WSL and Women's Championship, with any decisions taken having no bearing on the men's game. Like the top two tiers of women's football, all Premier League and English Football League games have been suspended until at least 30 April. It remains unclear how or when the season will be concluded, although some managers have said the campaign must be played to a finish to preserve the""integrity of the game"". Queens Park Rangers boss Mark Warburton said that even if it took until the end of the year to complete the season that would be the right thing to do. In a joint statement issued on Friday, the Premier League, EFL and Professional Footballers' Association said""difficult decisions will have to be taken""to counter the financial impact of coronavirus.

UK space company blames coronavirus for collapse,"OneWeb's largest unsecured creditor is the rocket operator Arianespace OneWeb, the high-profile London-based satellite start-up, has filed for bankruptcy protection in the US. The firm, which has been building a network to deliver broadband across the globe, blamed the Covid-19 crisis for its inability to secure new investment. OneWeb issued a statement,externalsaying it was laying off most of its staff while it seeks a buyer for the company. The start-up recently launched the 74th satellitein a constellation planned to total at least 648 spacecraft. The idea is that this network will provide high-bandwidth, low-latency internet connections to any point on Earth, bar Antarctica. Rumours of a collapse had been swirling around OneWeb this past week. It had raised Â£2.6bn to implement its project but experts in the space industry speculated that double this sum would probably be needed to complete the system. The statement released by OneWeb in the early hours of Saturday, London time, said the company had been close to obtaining financing but that, ""the process did not progress because of the financial impact and market turbulence related to the spread of Covid-19"". Virgin Atlantic seeks bailout in coming days OneWeb increases constellation to 74 satellites Europe's telescopes 'can meet satellite challenge' CEO Adrian Steckel added: ""Today is a difficult day for us at OneWeb. So many people have dedicated so much energy, effort, and passion to this company and our mission. Our hope is that this process will allow us to carve a path forward that leads to the completion of our mission, building on the years of effort and the billions of invested capital."" According to the bankruptcy court filing (PDF),external, the largest unsecured creditor is the rocket operator Arianespace, which has been using Soyuz vehicles to loft the satellites for OneWeb. It is owed $238m. OneWeb has a factory in Florida designed to turn out two satellites a day OneWeb's plan was first presented in detail to the mediaat London's Royal Institution in 2015. Early supporters included Airbus, Intelsat, Bharti Enterprises, Coca Cola, Group Salinas, Hughes Network Systems, and Virgin Group. Softbank became a major investor. But building satellite constellations is a very expensive undertaking and the history of the sector is littered with companies that also ended up seeking Chapter 11 protection with the US Bankruptcy Court. Some have managed to pull through - the classic example being Iridium, which launched the first low-Earth-orbit satellite-phone network.It recently put up a second-generation constellation in the sky. OneWeb is seeking to do the same. As well as successfully launching 74 satellites, it has valuable radio spectrum rights and has built getting on for half of the 44 ground stations needed to operate its constellation. It will hope this progress will prove attractive to a new owner. OneWeb has been in competition with California entrepreneur Elon Musk's SpaceX company to build a satellite internet mega-constellation. His rockets are regularly putting up 60 satellites at a time. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, the world's richest man, is also working on a concept he calls Kuiper. If no buyer for OneWeb or its assets can be found, the UK government is ultimately responsible for the 74 spacecraft in orbit. As the licensing state, it will carry the liability if these satellites are involved in a collision. OneWeb has control rooms in London and Virginia to monitor and command the satellites Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk,externaland follow me on Twitter:@BBCAmos,external Locals find homes reduced to ash as fears grow of more fierce winds spreading LA fires Climate 'whiplash' linked to raging LA fires Watch: The moment five US presidents gather at Jimmy Carter's funeral The '9/11 mastermind' is set to plead guilty.

Premier League clubs were already due to meet again on 3 April, when it is almost certain the current postponement of all matchesuntil 30 Aprilwill be extended again.

No Democratic lawmakers were invited to the historic signing ceremony, which was held at the White House, though the president thanked both parties ""for coming together, setting aside their differences and putting America first"". Mr Trump said the package was ""twice as large"" as any prior relief bill. ""This will deliver urgently needed relief to our nation's families, workers and businesses,"" he said. Just before signing the act into law, Mr Trump invoked the Defence Production Act (DPA), which gives the president the power to force private industries to create items required for national defence. Mr Trump said the order will compel General Motors (GM) to manufacture much-needed medical ventilators for the federal government. Earlier in the day, Mr Trump tweeted that GM had promised to ""give us 40,000 much needed Ventilators, 'very quickly'.

During the bill signing, the president said that ""tremendous [medical] supplies"" would be coming soon, adding: ""We've had great results on just about everything we're talking about."" Earlier on Friday, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced eight temporary hospitals to meet an expected surge in cases. Coronavirus updates from around the world At least 965 people have died in the state - the worst-hit in the US - with 59,568 confirmed cases. Democrats and Republicans in the Democratic-led House approved the stimulus package by voice vote on Friday following a three-hour debate. ""Our nation faces an economic and health emergency of historic proportions due to the coronavirus pandemic, the worst pandemic in over 100 years,"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said. Members of the House had been ready to conduct the vote at their homes but were forced to return to Washington at the last minute after a Republican representative from Kentucky demanded a quorum of half the chamber be present. Thomas Massie - who objected to the stimulus package saying it contained too much spending - also sought to delay proceedings by demanding a formal recorded vote, as opposed to a voice vote, but was overruled. Mr Trump vented his fury at Mr Massie on Twitter, calling him a ""third-rate grandstander"" and demanding he be thrown out of the Republican party. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms?

It seeks to deliver $1,200 to every American earning less than $75,000 per year and $500 per child. It also gives money to directly to state governments, and bolsters the unemployment benefits programme. Under the law, jobless benefits will be extended to those not normally covered, such as freelancers and workers in the gig economy.

Officials across the US have closed restaurants, bars, cinemas, hotels and gyms in an effort to slow the spread of the virus. Car firms have halted production and air travel has fallen dramatically. According to economists, a fifth of the US workforce is on some form of lockdown. With almost 1,500 virus-related fatalities, the US death toll remains lower than those in Italy and China. But there are virus hotspots in New York, New Orleans and Detroit. Mr Cuomo said in any ""realistic scenario"" cases of people seriously ill from the virus would overwhelm New York's healthcare system.

Governor John Bel Edwards said New Orleans would run out of ventilators by 2 April and possibly run out of hospital beds by 7 April if the number of new infections did not subside. ""It's not some flimsy theory. This is what is going to happen,"" he said. Medical staff across the country are also reporting shortages of personal protective equipment. Earlier on Friday World Health Organization chief Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said a ""chronic global shortage"" of protective equipment was one of the ""most urgent threats"" to the ability to save lives. On Thursday Vice-President Mike Pence said coronavirus tests were now available in all 50 states and more than 552,000 tests had been conducted nationwide. Mr Trump had set a much-criticised goal of Easter Sunday, 12 April, for reopening the country. He later extended the country's social distancing guidelines to 30 April and predicted the country would be on its way to recovery by 1 June.

Trump orders 'time-wasting' GM to make ventilators,"US President Donald Trump has ordered General Motors to make ventilators for coronavirus patients after attacking the car giant's chief executive. He invoked the Korean War-era Defense Production Act, which allows a president to force companies to make products for national defence. Mr Trump said that ""GM was wasting time"" and action was needed to save American lives. The US now has 143,532 cases of the virus, the most in the world. With 2,572 fatalities, America's Covid-19 death toll still lags far behind Italy and China. Congress passes huge financial stimulus package A snapshot of American life under lockdown Mr Trump had previously said the defence order was not necessary, because companies were voluntarily converting their operations to help fight the spread of coronavirus. This video can not be played Trump says governors should be more ""appreciative"" But on Friday he said in a statement: ""The virus is too urgent to allow the give-and-take of the contracting process to continue to run its normal course."" Earlier in the day he took to Twitter to complain that GM had lowered the number of ventilators they had promised to deliver from 40,000 to 6,000 and had wanted ""top dollar"". He also criticised GM chief executive Mary Barra, saying things were ""always a mess"" with her at the helm of the Detroit-based auto manufacture. Allow Twitter content?

GM said on Friday it could build at least 10,000 ventilators per month from April. GM has been working with a Seattle-based medical device manufacturer, Ventec Life Systems, to build ventilators at the car maker's plant in Kokomo, Indiana. GM's factory in Warren, Michigan, will be used to make surgical masks, the Associated Press reports.

During the coronavirus task force briefing on Friday, the president said: ""We're not looking to be ripped off on price."" Mr Trump also acknowledged he was ""extremely unhappy"" over the closing of GM's plant in Lordstown, Ohio. The car-maker sold the factory last November, axing 1,400 jobs in a key presidential swing state. The medical machines that keep patients breathing are much in demand amid the respiratory illness' outbreak, which in the most serious cases attacks the lungs. Louisiana's governor said on Friday that New Orleans could run out of ventilators by 2 April. The Society of Critical Care Medicine has estimated that 960,000 intensive care patients will require a ventilator at some point during the US coronavirus outbreak. New York has requested 30,000 ventilators, but Mr Trump said during Friday's briefing he felt that was a ""high"" estimate. This video can not be played Why staying at home in is a matter of life and death New York Governor Andrew Cuomo fired back, insisting the request was based on ""facts and on data"". The state remains the epicentre of the Covid-19 crisis in the US, with over 7,000 new cases announced on Friday alone. There are a total of 59,568 patients thus far, and the death toll has climbed to 965. For the first time since the 9/11 attacks, New York City has been preparing makeshift mortuary space, readying refrigerated lorries to help hospitals as the death toll rises. This week governors in Florida, Maryland, South Carolina, Rhode Island and Texas have ordered visitors from the New York area to self-quarantine for at least 14 days upon arrival. The neighbouring state of Connecticut has implored New Yorkers to keep away altogether. On Friday, Rhode Island police began pulling over vehicles with New York registration plates to obtain contact information in order to enforce the mandatory 14-day quarantine.

A lot has happened today, so here's a quick recap: Earlier today, President Trump said he was considering imposing a quarantine on New York, and parts of New Jersey and Connecticut, to slow the spread of coronavirus. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has responded by saying that the ""quarantine"" is already happening in his state, which has banned major gatherings and ordered people to remain at home. However, Mr Cuomo said he would oppose any effort to ""lockdown"" his state. ""If you said we were geographically restricted from leaving, that would be a lockdown,"" he told CNN. ""Then we would be Wuhan, China, and that wouldnât make any sense,"" he said, adding that this would cause the stock market to crash in a way that would make it impossible for the US economy to ""recover for months, if not years"". ""You would paralyse the financial sector,"" he added, calling it the opposite of Mr Trump's hope to quickly jumpstart the US economy. ""It's a preposterous idea, frankly,"" he said, adding it would be ""anti-American"" and a ""declaration of war"" on states by the federal government. It is not clear whether Mr Trump could close state borders. While the president does have sweeping powers, especially during a national emergency, it is the role of state and local governments to take the lead in preventing the spread of disease. Mr Cuomo also said that he plans to sue Rhode Island if they continue targeting New Yorkers to threaten them with punishment if they do not quarantine. That state's governor has mobilised soldiers to seek out fleeing New Yorkers. People should prepare to fight coronavirus like they would prepare for surgery by staying fit and healthy - that's according to medics at the Centre for Perioperative Care (CPOC). They suggest a healthy diet, exercise, alcohol-free days and quitting smoking will reduce the risk of becoming severely ill with the virus and ending up in intensive care. CPOC deputy director Scarlett McNally said there has been ""a lot of very important advice"" on how to cut the risk of becoming infected, but there was ""little on the importance of preparing in case the virus is contracted"". Read the full storyhere Boris Johnson chaired the morning Covid-19 meeting via video-link Here's a recap of the latest coronavirus developments in the UK today: The US has recorded its first death from an infant who tested positive for coronavirus. The baby died in Chicago, Illinois Department of Public Health Director Dr Ngozi Ezike said. ""There has never before been a death associated with Covid-19 in an infant,external. A full investigation is under way to determine the cause of death,"" Dr Ezike said. ""We must do everything we can to prevent the spread of this deadly virus. If not to protect ourselves, but to protect those around us."" The death of a child less than a year old with coronavirus was previously reported in China, but that child had a pre-existing condition. Rhode Island, the smallest state in the US, has called on the National Guard to stop all cars with New York license plates to ask about where they plan to self-isolate for 14 days, as required under the state's emergency orders. Troops are also going door-to-door in seaside vacation communities in search of New Yorkers. ""Right now, we have a pinpointed risk that we need to address, and we need to be very serious and that risk is called New York City,"" said Governor Gina Raimondo at a news conference on Friday. New York state has the most cases in the US right now - with more than 50,000 cases. The Rhode Island National Guard retweeted video of one such roadblock. Allow Twitter content?

People in self-isolation with suspected Covid-19 symptoms are to receive regular check-in texts from the NHS to check how they are. On Saturday the UK government launched a new messaging service which will send daily texts to new patients who register their symptoms and contact details with the 111 online service. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: ""I know all too well that experiencing symptoms can be worrying, but for those living on their own it will be even more so. Alongside other measures, this new daily text service will reassure our most vulnerable that they are not alone, and also to help them manage their symptoms."" The service was commissioned by NHSX and built by NHS Digital and the NHS Business Services Authority. The UK has transformed beyond recognition in the space of a month. From one confirmed case to school closures and a lockdown, this piece by BBC Stories explores how everything happened so quickly. Read the story in full here.   The Republic of Ireland has seen 14 more deaths in the last 24 hours bringing the total number of people to have died to 36.

During the check, they will be asked health questions and staff will be required to look for signs of illness, according to theGlobe and Mail.,externalThose who show symptoms will not be allowed to travel for 14 days. âIf you feel the onset of symptoms of a cold or of COVID-19, you need to stay at home, you need to isolate, you need to not travel,â Mr Trudeau said. He added that Canadians had been doing an excellent job at staying at home but he would enforce further measures to keep Canadians safe if needed. âRight now weâre not looking at closing the provincial borders,â he said.

The worldwide death toll from coronavirus has surpassed 30,000 according to data from Johns Hopkins University. Italy has recorded the most deaths with the toll standing at 10,023. Earlier today Spain announced its total number of deaths had reached 5,690. Philippa RoxbyHealth reporter, BBC News Despite today's news of the largest rise in people dying in the UK with Covid-19, the message is that everything we are all doing now to reduce social contact is having an impact. We just can't see it in the figures yet. That's because it takes time for the effects of not going out and not going to work to be felt in hospitals, where the most seriously-ill are being tested and some are, sadly, dying. The epidemic is expected to peak in the UK in the next two to three weeks. Until then, it is likely the number of people confirmed to have the coronavirus and the number of people dying after testing positive for the virus will continue to grow at a similar pace - doubling every two or three days. The hope is that everyone's efforts now to stay at home and reduce the spread of this deadly virus will slow that growth rate at the right time, and, in time, bring it down. Luck doesn't come into it, people are being told. Only a huge national effort will make the difference. Every one of us now has a part to play in making that happen. From on-the-spot-fines to dying blue lagoons black... Police here in the UK are able to issue on-the-spot penalty notices of up to Â£60 ($75) or even make arrests for those seen to be flouting UK measures to help tackle the virus. And there have been a few - if not entirely typical - cases of disobedience to handle. They include those caught threatening key workers by coughing, who will face serious criminal charges. At leasttwo men have been convicted already. Another man in Nottinghamshire has been charged with assault afterallegedly spitting at officers while claiming to have symptoms. Elsewhere, some police forces have been using more unusual tactics. For example, in Derbyshire police threw black dye into a tourist hotspot known as the blue lagoon, in a bid to reduce visitor numbers. Derbyshire Police said people had been gathering at the Blue Lagoon in ""contravention of the current instruction of the UK government"" One would-be holidaymaker from the Midlands wasforced to turn his motorhome around on the motorway,externalin Devon, with one sergeant saying the trip was ""not in the spirit"" of the effort to tackle the outbreak. And one force has witnessed asurge in calls from people reporting neighbours,externalfor going for more than one jog a day, or congregating for barbecues Meanwhile, police have begun appealing for retired officers to return to the fold during the pandemic. Ex officers have beentelling the BBC why they are willing to answer the call.

Virgin Atlantic seeks bailout in coming daysThe airline is to ask the government for cash to keep going after coronavirus leads to travel slump.,"Virgin Airlines has seen passengers numbers slump as countries close borders and enact travel bans Virgin Atlantic is expected to ask for a government bailout worth hundreds of millions of pounds in the coming days, the BBC understands. Requests for state aid are also expected from other airlines. The government has said it will only step in to help struggling airlines ""as a last resort"" on a case-by-case basis. However, the Transport Secretary told MPs he can't rule out the state taking an ownership stake in UK airlines that have been battered by coronavirus. Grant Shapps told MPs on the Transport Select Committee that nothing had been ruled out in its response to coronavirus for the aviation sector. Asked by Labour MP Ruth Cadbury if the government would consider buying a share of UK airlines that face collapse, Mr Shapps said: ""It was important to save companies that would survive in normal times. However, the Transport Secretary said current shareholders ""must be part of the solution"". UK-based airlines have already announced measures to save money such astemporarily laying-off staff. Virgin Atlantic had previously suggested the government offer UK carriers Â£7.5 billion in credit facilities. The airline's founder Sir Richard Branson this week offered to inject Â£250 million into the Virgin Group, with most of that amount going to the airline. The vast bulk of flights to and from the UK have beengrounded amid the coronaviruspandemic. Some airlines like British Airways are still operating a number of rescue flights to bring stranded Brits home. Earlier this week, the government said it would not deliver a financial aid package for the aviation industry, but its emergency business measures, including a Bank of England scheme for firms to raise capital and employee wage subsidies, were available for airlines. But industry group the International Air Transport Association (IATA) warned of an ""apocalypse"" in the aviation sector as it called on governments around the world for help. The US Senate on Wednesday passed a $58 billion (Â£46.6 billion) aid package for its airline industry, which included cash for paying pilot, crew and staff salaries. You'd be forgiven for being confused about whether the government is going to bailout UK-based airlines, or not. First ministers indicated that an industry-wide bailout was on the cards. Virgin Atlantic went public and said Â£7.5bn was needed. But then an about turn from the Chancellor. Rishi Sunak wrote to airlines and airports telling them that an industry-wide emergency rescue package for the aviation industry wasn't on its way after all. What the government is offering is bespoke financial support on a case-by-case basis, but only once airlines have exhausted all other options. Ministers want to be sure that wealthy shareholders play their part. The other reason an industry-wide package didn't happen was because the airlines involved are ultimately rivals and where as some of them were champing at the bit for a government loan, others were against it.

"The month everything changedIn the space of a month, the United Kingdom has transformed beyond recognition.Stories","In the space of a month, the United Kingdom has transformed beyond recognition. And most of us haven't had time to stop and take stock. One Friday afternoon, when the UK was another country, a chalkboard leaned against the outside wall of a country pub. A message had been written in neat, thin capital letters. ""Unfortunately a customer who visited us has tested positive for the coronavirus,"" it read. ""So as a precautionary measure we are closing for a full deep clean."" It was signed by the landlord and landlady, who apologised for the inconvenience. The pub was located along a quiet, narrow road just outside Haslemere in Surrey. The patient who had gone there lived somewhere in the county. Unlike previous British cases detected up to that point - he was the 20th - he hadn't been abroad recently. As far as anyone knew, he was the first to catch the virus inside the UK. On the same day, 28 February 2020, came another news update. A grimmer milestone. A British man who'd been infected on the Diamond Princess cruise ship became the first UK citizen to die, in Japan, from Covid-19. That afternoon, children were still in classrooms and adults were still at work. People shook hands and hugged and kissed. In the evening, they went to pubs and restaurants. Some went on dates and others visited elderly relatives. They assembled in groups and mingled with residents of other households. As the weekend went on, football fans crammed into stadiums. Worshippers gathered in churches, mosques, temples and synagogues. You could go outside for as long as you liked, if you didn't mind the rain. On supermarket shelves, toilet paper and paracetamol were plentiful. Recent storms had left large swathes of the country flooded, but for most British people, life went on as it always had and seemingly always would. Insofar as any of this describes a British way of life, though, it was one that ceased to exist entirely within just a few weeks. The changes didn't happen smoothly, in steady, barely noticeable steps. Instead, the UK's sense of what was normal shifted in sudden movements, as though a ratchet was being yanked. On 28 February 2020 people in the UK were already taking notice of the outbreak. It would have been difficult to ignore entirely the headlines about what was happening in China, South Korea, Iran and Italy. The first confirmed cases among travellers returning to the UK had come as early as January, but it still seemed possible to regard this as something happening, for the most part, a long way away. Not every newspaper front page that Friday morning led with Covid-19 - the Daily Mail splashed on the saga of Harry and Meghan, the Daily Express with Brexit talks - but most did. In the final week of the month 442,675 phone calls were made to the non-emergency NHS line 111. People weren't yet panicking, but a generalised sense of low-level anxiety was everywhere. By 1 March, the virus had reached the four corners of the United Kingdom - cases had been detected in England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. Two days later, with the total number at 51, Prime Minister Boris Johnson stood behind a lectern and launched the government's Coronavirus Action Plan. The outbreak was declared a ""level four incident"". Up to a fifth of the workforce might be off sick at its peak, the prime ministerwarned. Schools might have to close and large-scale gatherings be reduced. However seriously anyone took the warning, it was still difficult to visualise. The following day, a woman in her 70s with an underlying condition - those last four words soon became grimly familiar to anyone who followed news bulletins - became the first person to die inside the UK after testing positive for the virus. The firstreports,externalof hand sanitiser selling out in supermarkets were published. Each day the number of confirmed cases crept up - 115 by 5 March, 206 by 7 March, 273 by 8 March. On 11 March, the day that the World Health Organization declared a pandemic, Liverpool FC hosted Atletico Madrid - who were already playing their home games behind closed doors. There were anxieties about whether it was a great idea to allow the 3,000 Spanish supporters to fly into a major British city where they would eat, drink, mingle and sleep. Anyone with plans to fly out of the UK was beginning to reconsider. Another twist of the ratchet was imminent. The following day, the government's Sage committee of scientific experts was shown revised modelling of the likely death toll. The figures,according to the Sunday Times,external, were ""shattering"". If nothing was done, there would be 510,000 deaths. Under the existing ""mitigation"" strategy - to shield the most vulnerable while letting everyone go about their business mostly as normal - there would be a quarter of a million. In a press conference, the prime minister told anyone with a continuous cough or a fever to self-isolate. His instruction came with a warning that ""many more families are going to lose loved ones before their time"". The bluntness was shocking. Some asked why, in that case, more wasn't being done. On Friday 13, the London Marathon, the Premier League and English Football League and May's local elections were all postponed. Scotland had its first coronavirus-related death. Saturday 14 and Sunday 15 March was the last relatively normal weekend. You couldn't watch league football but you could go to the pub. Hand sanitiser now wasn't to be found on any supermarket shelves, but you could tell your friends about your plans to practise ""social distancing"" if you met them on the street. Around the country, people looked at Italy, France and Spain, which had already gone into lockdown, and wondered if the UK was next. Volunteers began forming mutual aid groups to deliver food and medicine to vulnerable people who were self-isolating. In person and on WhatsApp, families and groups of friends argued about what it all meant. The more anxious wondered why the British government was moving more cautiously than its counterparts on the continent. The more blasÃ© complained about why they were going to all this bother. Wasn't it just a bit of flu? The latter sentiment was exactly the kind of thing the government's advisers were most worried about. On Monday 16, the prime minister advised against ""non-essential"" travel, urged people to avoid pubs and clubs and work from home. Across the country, kitchen tables were cleared to make way for laptops. Thanks to Skype and the virtual meetings app, Zoom, white-collar workers started getting a glimpse of their colleagues' interior decor. Those who couldn't do their jobs like this wondered how on Earth they were supposed to earn money and stay safe. On 17 March, the government began holding daily press conferences - events that would soon become regular viewing for nervous families. Just six days after presenting his budget, the Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, announced Â£300bn in loan guarantees - a huge expansion of state intervention in the economy by a Conservative government. There were still calls for more to be done to stop Britons infecting each other. The following day, most school pupils - those whose parents weren't designated key workers - were told they wouldn't go back to their classes until further notice. Exams, proms, farewells to classmates and teachers would now never happen. But although the UK had been told not to go to restaurants, cafes and pubs, many restaurants, cafes and pubs stayed open. They were quieter than usual but some customers still came. On the evening of Friday 20, the prime minister - who in a long career as a newspaper columnist had steadfastly demonstrated libertarian instincts - ordered restaurants, cafes and pubs to close, a measure that even in the darkest moments of World War Two would have been unthinkable. For much of the weekend that followed, there was bright sunshine, and people poured outside to take advantage of the last leisure option open to them. But when they crowded into parks and on to the summit of Snowdon they were seen - and widely condemned. This was not how ""social distancing"" - now regarded as everyone's social duty - was meant to operate. The lockdown was coming. On Monday 23 at 20:30, the television screens showed the prime minister sitting behind a desk. He was about to announce some of the most draconian restrictions on individual liberty the UK had ever seen. You could only leave home to exercise once a day, travel to and from work when absolutely necessary and only go shopping for essential items. You had to stand two metres apart from people you didn't live with. You weren't to gather in public in groups bigger than two. The British people were being told to avoid human contact when they needed it most. All through the following week, people would look forward to their one state-sanctioned form of outdoor exercise a day. Or they would stand in front of their laptops, following the instructions set by the fitness coach, Joe Wicks. By the time the weekend arrived, there were more than 537,000 confirmed cases in 175 countries. More than a quarter of all the people on the planet were living under some kind of restrictions in their social contact and movements. British life had been transformed so dramatically, and so fast, that you hadn't had time to dwell on it. On 28 February, London's Excel Centre had been hosting The Baby Show, ""the UK's largest parenting event"". A month later, the venue was a giant field hospital. This wasn't normal. Everything was described as ""unprecedented"" now, because it was. Speaking to the BBC's The World At One, historian Lord Peter Hennessy predicted that, in future, post-war Britain will be demarcated ""BC and AC - before corona and after corona"". Before 28 February, the UK was still widely portrayed as a place divided by Brexit, with younger, metropolitan Britons on one side, and their older counterparts in towns and the countryside on the other. That soon came to seem an anachronism. Elderly people were most at risk and those of working age, in the NHS and other key professions, were there to try and save them. Everyone was in this together. The framing of political debate since 2016 seemed inadequate to the new reality. Coronavirus would not be defeated by a populist attack on the elites. More than ever, the UK needed experts to lead the way. But the experts needed the masses, too - if the vast majority of the population didn't act, then Covid-19 couldn't be stopped. Initially, the lockdown was supposed to last three weeks. But a month on from 28 February, the UK is settling in for the long haul, with the prime minister, the health secretary and the first in line to the throne all having tested positive for the virus. You remember your last trip to the gym, the last drink you had in a cafe or a pub, the last time you hugged your mum or your grandad. You think about the life you once took for granted. You wonder if it will ever return. Follow@mrjonkelly,externalon Twitter Picture editor Emma Lynch A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms?

Trump orders 'time wasting' GM to make ventilators,"US President Donald Trump has ordered General Motors to make ventilators for coronavirus patients after attacking the car giant's chief executive. He invoked the Korean War-era Defense Production Act, which allows a president to force companies to make products for national defence. Mr Trump said that ""GM was wasting time"" and action was needed to save American lives. The US now has 143,532 cases of the virus, the most in the world. With 2,572 fatalities, America's Covid-19 death toll still lags far behind Italy and China. Congress passes huge financial stimulus package A snapshot of American life under lockdown Mr Trump had previously said the defence order was not necessary, because companies were voluntarily converting their operations to help fight the spread of coronavirus. This video can not be played Trump says governors should be more ""appreciative"" But on Friday he said in a statement: ""The virus is too urgent to allow the give-and-take of the contracting process to continue to run its normal course."" Earlier in the day he took to Twitter to complain that GM had lowered the number of ventilators they had promised to deliver from 40,000 to 6,000 and had wanted ""top dollar"". He also criticised GM chief executive Mary Barra, saying things were ""always a mess"" with her at the helm of the Detroit-based auto manufacture. Allow Twitter content?

GM said on Friday it could build at least 10,000 ventilators per month from April. GM has been working with a Seattle-based medical device manufacturer, Ventec Life Systems, to build ventilators at the car maker's plant in Kokomo, Indiana. GM's factory in Warren, Michigan, will be used to make surgical masks, the Associated Press reports. This video can not be played Coronavirus: Lack of medical supplies 'a national shame' The White House had been due to announce the joint venture between the two companies on Wednesday until Trump administration officials reportedly baulked at the $1bn bill to taxpayers. During the coronavirus task force briefing on Friday, the president said: ""We're not looking to be ripped off on price."" Mr Trump also acknowledged he was ""extremely unhappy"" over the closing of GM's plant in Lordstown, Ohio. The car-maker sold the factory last November, axing 1,400 jobs in a key presidential swing state. The medical machines that keep patients breathing are much in demand amid the respiratory illness' outbreak, which in the most serious cases attacks the lungs. Louisiana's governor said on Friday that New Orleans could run out of ventilators by 2 April. The Society of Critical Care Medicine has estimated that 960,000 intensive care patients will require a ventilator at some point during the US coronavirus outbreak. New York has requested 30,000 ventilators, but Mr Trump said during Friday's briefing he felt that was a ""high"" estimate. This video can not be played Why staying at home in is a matter of life and death New York Governor Andrew Cuomo fired back, insisting the request was based on ""facts and on data"". The state remains the epicentre of the Covid-19 crisis in the US, with over 7,000 new cases announced on Friday alone. There are a total of 59,568 patients thus far, and the death toll has climbed to 965. For the first time since the 9/11 attacks, New York City has been preparing makeshift mortuary space, readying refrigerated lorries to help hospitals as the death toll rises. This week governors in Florida, Maryland, South Carolina, Rhode Island and Texas have ordered visitors from the New York area to self-quarantine for at least 14 days upon arrival. The neighbouring state of Connecticut has implored New Yorkers to keep away altogether. On Friday, Rhode Island police began pulling over vehicles with New York registration plates to obtain contact information in order to enforce the mandatory 14-day quarantine. This video can not be played Coronavirus: Millions of Americans unemployed A Washington Post poll this week found 48% of Americans approve of the president's work and 46% disapprove - the highest approval and lowest disapproval ratings of his term. But former US Vice-President Joe Biden, who looks likely to be Mr Trump's Democratic challenger in the November presidential election, on Friday said Mr Trump had ""ignored the warnings for months"" and ""downplayed"" the threat of the pandemic. ""It's one of the greatest failures of presidential leadership in our history,"" Mr Biden tweeted.

Boris Johnson tests positive for coronavirus,"This video can not be played In a video on Twitter, Boris Johnson says he is self-isolating and will continue to work from home. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has tested positive for coronavirus and is self-isolating in Downing Street. He said he had experienced mild symptoms over the past 24 hours, including a temperature and cough, but would continue to lead the government. England's Health Secretary Matt Hancock said he had also tested positive while England's Chief Medical Officer, Prof Chris Whitty, has shown symptoms. Another 181 people died with the virus in the past day,figures showed.,external It takes the total number of UK deaths to 759, with 14,543 confirmed cases. The daily coronavirus news conference was led by Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove, alongside deputy chief medical officer Dr Jenny Harries and NHS England chief executive Sir Simon Stevens. What we don't know about coronavirus deaths They announced plans to begin a large-scale testing programme of health service staff,starting with critical care teams. It will later be expanded to cover social care staff too. It follows mounting criticism from NHS staff over a lack of testing - currently, only seriously-ill patients in hospital are being tested. Testing will be carried out on staff showing possible symptoms of the virus or staff who live with people who have symptoms - not for all frontline workers as a matter of course. ""This will be antigen testing - testing whether people currently have the disease - so that our health and social care workers can have security in the knowledge that they are safe to return to work if their test is negative,"" Mr Gove said. The British Medical Association, which represents doctors, said the announcement was ""long overdue"" and the lack of testing so far had been ""incredibly frustrating"". ""For every healthy member of staff at home self-isolating needlessly when they do not have the virus, the NHS is short of someone who could be providing vital care to patients on the frontline,"" BMA chairman Dr Chaand Nagpaul said. Sir Simon Stevens also announced plans for two further field hospitals in Birmingham and Manchester,similar to thatbeing readied at the ExCel centre in east London. He said that 33,000 beds - the equivalent of 50 hospitals - had been freed up across England ready for coronavirus patients. This video can not be played Michael Gove announced increased testing capacity for frontline workers The government has imposed strict restrictions on everyday life designed to slow the spread of the virus. However, BBC medical correspondent Fergus Walsh said the UK's daily death toll will still rise into the many hundreds in the coming weeks. This does not mean social distancing measures are not working - but there will be a lag of two to four weeks before we see the effects, our correspondent says. Mr Gove said scientific analysis suggested the rate of infection had been doubling every three to four days, but the ""fantastic"" public response to the restrictions would make a difference. Asked whether the prime minister and health secretary should have been ""better protected"", he said: ""The fact that the virus is no respecter of individuals, whoever they are, is one of the reasons why we do need to have strict social distancing measures so that we can reduce the rate of infection and reduce the pressure on the NHS,"" he added. Mr Johnson is thought to be the first world leader to announce they have the virus. He was last seen on Thursday night, clapping outside No 10 as part ofa nationwide gesture to thank NHS staffand carers. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In a video on his Twitter account, Mr Johnson, 55, said: ""I'm working from home and self-isolating and that's entirely the right thing to do. ""But, be in no doubt that I can continue, thanks to the wizardry of modern technology, to communicate with all my top team to lead the national fight-back against coronavirus."" The PM chaired a phone call on Friday morning, and later in the day, Downing Street said he had spoken to US President Donald Trump. ""The president wished the prime minister a speedy recovery from coronavirus,"" a spokesman said. ""They agreed to work together closely, along with the G7, the G20, and other international partners, to defeat the coronavirus pandemic."" How the UK clapped for carers from doorsteps and balconies Mr Hancock said,externalhe was experiencing mild symptoms of the virus, and would be self-isolating until next Thursday. He told BBC Look East it was ""understandable that people will ask the question"" why he and the prime minister were tested, but most people with possible symptoms were not. The health secretary said there was a protocol laid down by the chief medical officer which required a small number of senior figures, key to the national effort, to be tested. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? AVOIDING CONTACT:Should I self-isolate? STRESS:How to protect your mental health LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak Earlier this week the prime minister's spokesman said if Mr Johnson was unwell and unable to work, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, as the first secretary of state, would stand in. The prime minister's fiancÃ©e, Carrie Symonds, who is several months pregnant, is also self-isolating, although it is not known if they are still living together. Pregnant women in their third trimesterare advised to be particularly stringent,externalwhen following social distancing advice, and minimise social contact for up to 12 weeks. Maybe it was inevitable. One of the first moments that raised eyebrows in the course of the UK outbreak was when health minister Nadine Dorries came down with coronavirus. Then, last week, we discovered that some key staff in No 10, including the prime minister's chief Brexit negotiator David Frost, were self-isolating with suspected symptoms. A fair number of MPs took themselves off into isolation for fear of having contracted the infection. Their remaining colleagues were continually ordered to sit far apart on the green benches, before finally, this week, Parliament itself closed early, with no certain date for a return of normal business. Still, the news this morning that the prime minister himself has contracted coronavirus felt like a shock. Read more from Laura Neither the PM's senior adviser Dominic Cummings nor Chancellor Rishi Sunak has symptoms. They have not been tested. A Buckingham Palace spokesman confirmed the Queen, 93, saw Mr Johnson more than two weeks ago on 11 March, and she is in good health. The pair usually meet weekly for the prime minister's audience with the Queen, but the most recent meetings have been over the phone. In other developments: Police forces in England and Wales have fined peoplefor ignoring guidance issued to prevent the spread of coronavirus. The UK's chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance has said he expects the number of coronavirus cases to increase over the next two to three weeks, and then start to gradually decrease due to the current lockdown. Mayor Sadiq Khan has warned Londoners there will be ""a large number"" of deathsand temporary mortuaries will be set up across the capital. The Ministry of Justice says 27 prisoners, in 14 prisons, have tested positive. Italian restaurant chain Carluccio's is facing collapse,after warning it is facing permanent branch closures due to coronavirus. The number of people who have volunteered to help the NHS has reached 700,000. The government originally set a target of 250,000 but increased it to 750,000 after a huge response. More than 7,000 former nurses and midwiveshave signed up to return to the profession,external. Tesco has saidthat online shoppers will have their deliveries capped at 80 items from now on, while supermarkets will also use a government database of 1.5 million vulnerable shoppers in England to help prioritise delivery slots. The Queen's birthday parade, the Trooping the Colour, will not go ahead in its usual form, and other options are being considered. Mr Johnson and Mr Hancock were seen together and following social distancing advice at PMQs on Wednesday Other world leaders including Canada's Justin Trudeau and Germany's Angela Merkel have self-isolated after coming into contact with people who have tested positive for the virus. Politicians including Labour's shadow home secretary Diane Abbott shared messages to the PM, wishing him a ""speedy recovery"". Meanwhile, the president of the European Council, Charles Michel, told Mr Johnson: ""Europe wishes you a speedy recovery."" In the Irish Republic, the Taoiseach,Leo Varadkar, has announced tough new restrictions on movement. From midnight on Friday, for a two-week period until Easter Sunday, everyone must stay at home unless their work is essential or they are buying food.

Nurse helps 'coronavirus' man who drove into herOff-duty Lucy Duncan spends five hours in A&E with the elderly stranger after a car crash.Manchester,"Lucy Duncan works as a mental health nurse with North West Boroughs Healthcare An off-duty nurse has described how she spent five hours in A&E with an elderly man suspected of having coronavirus after he crashed into her car. Lucy Duncan, 24, was driving home from a 12-hour shift at Wigan hospital when her car was hit by another vehicle. She stopped and saw the driver ""slumped over"" the steering wheel and struggling to breathe. The 24-year-old called an ambulance and then went with him to hospital to comfort him. ""The man was so grateful that I stayed with him and kept squeezing my hand and pulling it close to him,"" Ms Duncan said. Her boss has described her as ""a superstar"". Ms Duncan had been returning from her seventh shift in a row at about 19:45 GMT on Thursday when the crash happened in Abram. ""He grabbed my arm and kept apologising, and said he thought he had coronavirus,"" she said. ""He was grey and sweating, and struggling to breathe - he looked really ill."" The man, believed to be in his 70s, told her he had been in isolation for more than a week but had been forced to leave his home to buy food. ""So I called an ambulance and followed him in my own car, and stayed with him for five hours wearing full PPE,"" she said. ""I don't think I did anything out of the ordinary but a lot of people have told me they wouldn't have done it. ""I just want to go back and see him, and know that he's OK.""
