BBC to help students identify 'fake news'Kamal Ahmed and Tina Daheley are among BBC journalists who will take part in events targeted at pupils.6m6 minutes agoEntertainment & Arts,"Kamal Ahmed and Tina Daheley will help mentor students The BBC is launching a new scheme to help young people identify real news and filter out fake or false information. The project is targeted at secondary schools and sixth forms across the UK. From March, up to 1,000 schools will be offered mentoring in class and online to help them spot so-called fake news. BBC journalists including Kamal Ahmed, Tina Daheley, Amol Rajan and Huw Edwards will also take part in events aimed at helping students. Amol Rajan: Teaching fact from fiction James Harding, the director of BBC News, said: ""This is an attempt to go into schools to speak to young people and give them the equipment they need to distinguish between what's true and what's false."" The move follows a year-long study, conducted by the University of Salford in conjunction with BBC Newsround, looking athow well children aged between nine and 14 can spot false information. Although most of the children from across all age groups said they knew what fake news was, many of them could not always distinguish between fake and real stories when presented with them. BBC Director of News James Harding: ""Some information is downright lies."" The term ""fake news"" was popularised by Donald Trump during his presidential election campaign last year. He used the term to denigrate the output of the traditional news media, although it is also used to describe news stories that achieve significant traction despite being palpably false. Recent examples include a satirical story claiming that the Pope had endorsed Trump for president, which was widely circulated as an established fact. The issue surfaced again this month when the President retweeted three inflammatory videos from a British far-right group whose authenticity was subsequently challenged. In November, The Independent - now an online newspaper - streamed a video ""live from space"" that turned out to be footage recorded in 2015. In July, meanwhile, a Facebook Live videopurporting to show a stormwas outed by social media users as a gif. ""I think that people are getting the news all over the place - there's more information than ever before,"" said Harding. ""But, as we know, some of it is old news, some of it is half truths. Some of it is just downright lies. And it's harder than ever when you look at those information feeds to discern what's true and what's not. ""But there are 'tells', there are ways that you can look at your news feed and identify a story that's true and a story that's not. ""And we think that's a skill that enables people to make good choices about the information they get and good choices in their lives."" Last month a surveyby media watchdog Ofcom,externalfound almost three quarters of children aged between 12 and 15 were aware of so-called ""fake news"" and that half of them has read a story they suspected of being false.

"First tax havens blacklist published by EUSaint Lucia, Barbados and South Korea are among 17 territories labelled as tax havens by Brussels.4h4 hours agoBusiness","Saint Lucia is on the EU's 17 ""non-cooperative jurisdictions"" The European Union has published its first blacklist of tax havens, naming 17 territories including Saint Lucia, Barbados and South Korea. A ""watchlist"" of 47 countries promising to change their tax rules to meet EU standards has also been issued. The ""grey list"" includes several with UK links, including Hong Kong, Jersey, Bermuda and the Cayman Islands, as well as Switzerland and Turkey. Both lists,externalhave been criticised as omitting the most notorious tax havens. The lists follow the leaking of the Panama Papers and the Paradise Papers, revealing how companies and individuals hid their wealth from tax authorities around the world in offshore accounts. EU tax commissioner Pierre Moscovici said the blacklist represented ""substantial progress"", adding: ""Its very existence is an important step forward. But because it is the first EU list, it remains an insufficient response to the scale of tax evasion worldwide."" How much of the world's wealth is hidden offshore? Panama Papers: full coverage To determine whether a country is a ""non-cooperative jurisdiction"" the EU index measures the transparency of its tax regime, tax rates and whether the tax system encourages multinationals to unfairly shift profits to low tax regimes to avoid higher duties in other states. In particular these include tax systems that offer incentives such as 0% corporate tax to foreign companies. EU members have been left to decide what action to take against the offenders. Ministers ruled out imposing a withholding tax on transactions to tax havens as well as other financial sanctions. Some states, such as Luxembourg and Malta, opposed stricter sanctions, according to officials. EU Commission Vice-President Valdis Dombrovskis said ""stronger countermeasures would have been preferable"". Panama is one of the 17 countries listed by the EU but its president, Juan Carlos Varela, said the country was ""not in any way a tax haven"". Panama is on the EU's tax havens blacklist The EU is encouraging member states to take what it calls ""defensive actions"" against those countries that do not reform their tax systems. The UK-based charity Oxfam last week published its own list of 35 countries that it said should be blacklisted. Oli Pearce, Oxfam's inequality and tax policy advisor, said: ""It is disturbing to see mostly small countries on the EU blacklist, while the most notorious tax havens - UK-linked places like Bermuda, the Cayman Islands, Jersey and the Virgin Islands - escape with a place on the 'grey list'. ""Although we recognise this is a step in the right direction, if EU leaders let too many tax havens off the hook we'll all lose out. A place on the grey list must not mean tax havens get off scot-free."" However, tax campaigner Richard Murphy said some countries on the grey list could still face heavy sanctions if they failed to reform their tax systems. He said EU countries will be encouraged to disallow payments made to these places for tax purposes, or to charge withholding taxes on interest payments to them. That tactic could ""utterly neuter their so-called status as 'tax neutral international  financial centres' by ensuring that all monies they receive have been taxed before getting there"", Mr Murphy said. ""The EU is also saying to the UK that it is taking real measures against British Overseas Territories and Crown Dependencies, and the message is - if you go the same way as them with a similar low-tax regime after Brexit, you'll be sanctioned too."" The 17 blacklisted territories are: American Samoa Bahrain Barbados Grenada Guam South Korea Macau The Marshall Islands Mongolia Namibia Palau Panama Saint Lucia Samoa Trinidad and Tobago Tunisia United Arab Emirates The EU made exceptions for countries faced with natural disasters such as hurricanes, and put the process temporarily on hold.

Brexit deal plan a 'big shock' for DUP,"This video can not be played Arlene Foster claimed the Irish government prevented the DUP seeing the wording of the text The deal the UK government was set to agree with the European Union on Monday came as ""a big shock"" to the DUP, its leader Arlene Foster has said. She was speaking to Republic of Ireland national broadcaster RTÃ. Talks in Brussels halted because the DUP, which props up the Tory minority government, rejected a proposal about the future of the Irish border. Mrs Foster said the DUP saw the text of the deal on Monday morning, despite asking to see it for five weeks. ""Once we saw the text, we knew it was not going to be acceptable,"" she said. How to get out of Brexit linguistic hole? Ball is now in London's court - Varadkar What is 'regulatory alignment'? Long read: The hardest border Reality check: How much trade is there between UK and Ireland Talks between Prime Minister Theresa May and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker broke up without agreement on Monday. The crucial sticking point was over how closely aligned Northern Ireland'sregulations will be with those in the Republic of Ireland,and the rest of the EU, in order to avoid a ""hard"" border. Nigel Dodds (centre) and the other DUP MPs outside the House of Commons Mrs Foster said her party could not sign up to anything that would allow a border to develop in the Irish Sea and that its red line was any situation where Northern Ireland was different from the rest of the UK. Ms Foster also said that the British negotiating team indicated to her that it was the Irish government that prevented the DUP from being shown a copy of the text. However, the Irish government has rejected Ms Foster's claim and said it had ""no role whatsoever in the negotiations conducted by the British government"". ""It therefore had no involvement in any decision on which documents should go to the DUP,"" the Irish government said. Ms Foster also said that she told Mrs May the DUP would not support Brexit legislation in the House of Commons unless the text presented on Monday was changed. She said that she had a very open conversation with Mrs May aftershe had made the DUP position clear in a press conference on Monday afternoon. She said she told Mrs May that ""it could have been dealt with differently"". She said the DUP now wishes to look at the text, make it clear what they cannot agree with and try to work through to move on to Phase Two of the talks. ""Nobody wants a hard border on the island of Ireland,"" she added. Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Leo Varadkar  told the DÃ¡il (Irish parliament) that ""the ball is now in London's court"". He said that he accepted that Mrs May was negotiating in good faith but had difficulties. Earlier on Tuesday, DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds said the Irish government was risking Anglo-Irish relations and co-operation in Northern Ireland with a ""reckless and dangerous"" attitude to Brexit talks. Mr Dodds accused the Irish government of ""flexing their muscles"". Speaking in the House of Commons Brexit Secretary David Davis told MPs that Northern Ireland would not be ""left behind"". He emphatically denied a suggestion that Northern Ireland would remain in the single market and the customs union after Brexit. The Labour Party described the government's approach to Brexit talks as ""embarrassing"". Nigel Dodds accused the Irish government of being more aggressive since Leo Varadkar came to power However, Mr Dodds accused the Irish government of a ""noticeable change in tone and aggression"" since Mr Varadkar and Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney came to power. by Mark Devenport, BBC News NI political editor ""Rubbish"" - the response from a senior DUP source when I put it to them that the party had been kept in the loop about Theresa May's Brexit deal, but got cold feet when the likes of Nicola Sturgeon, Carwyn Jones and Sadiq Khan started demanding the same special treatment for Scotland, Wales and London. Something doesn't add up. Last Thursday, DUP leader Arlene Foster declared that her party was ""in constant contact on these issues with the government"". Was that via face-to-face meetings of the two parties' ""co-ordination committee"", or just via telephone conversations? If the latter, the line must have been very crackly. Read more here. Mr Dodds added it was clear that the European Union has given a veto to the Irish government and that they were ""flexing their muscles and using their current position to try and gain wins for them"". ""I don't argue with their desire to advance their interests but they're doing so in a reckless and dangerous way that is putting at risk years of good Anglo-Irish relations and good co-operation within Northern Ireland."" Theresa May needs the DUP's support because she does not have a majority in the House of Commons He added: ""What matters are the words that are used in text and in international treaties and agreements and it's vitally important that text translates accurately to what are the general principles of political agreement."" The prime minister needs the support of the DUP, which is Northern Ireland's largest party and has 10 MPs at Westminster, because she does not have a majority to win votes in the House of Commons. Meanwhile, Shadow Brexit Secretary Keir Starmer claimed in the House of Commons that the Conservatives' agreement with the DUP at Westminster was a ""coalition of chaos"" and said ""the DUP tail is wagging the Tory dog."" This video can not be played Labour: May to blame for Brexit 'embarrassment' But Mr Davis said ""the suggestion that we might depart the European Union to leave one part of the United Kingdom behind and still inside the single market and the customs union - that is emphatically not something that the UK government is considering"". ""So when the first minister of Wales complains about it or the first minister of Scotland uses it as a reason to start banging the tattered drum of independence or the Mayor of London says it justifies a hard border on the M25, I say they are making a foolish mistake. ""No UK government would allow such a thing let alone a Conservative and Unionist government."" DUP leader shocked by text of Brexit plan.

'Profumo affair' model Keeler dies,"Christine Keeler worked as a model in the 1960s Christine Keeler, the model embroiled in the 1963 Profumo affair, has died aged 75, her son has said. Seymour Platt said Ms Keeler had been ill for several months,externalwith chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. He told the BBC: ""She was always a fighter, but sadly lost the final fight against a terrible lung disease."" She became famous for her part in the scandal, which shook Harold Macmillan's government, but her son said that fame came ""at a huge personal price"". At the height of the Cold War, the-then teenager claimed she had an affair with Conservative cabinet minister John Profumo. She also claimed to be in a relationship with a Russian diplomat - Eugene Ivanov, an assistant naval attachÃ© at the Soviet Embassy - at the same time. Obituary: Christine Keeler John Profumo 'had relationship with Nazi spy' Mr Profumo was forced to resign after lying about the affair to Parliament and the scandal is considered to have contributed to the fall of the Macmillan government. Ms Keeler's family said she died on Monday at 23:30 GMT at the Princess Royal University Hospital in Orpington, south-east London. Paying tribute to his mother, Mr Platt told the BBC: ""She earned her place in British history but at a huge personal price."" ""And regardless, we are all very proud of who she was to the end,"" he added. Douglas Thompson, the journalist and author who worked with Ms Keeler on her memoir The Truth At Last, paid tribute to a ""funny and bright"" woman, whom he described as ""one of the most honest people I have ever met"". ""She believed absolutely everything she ever said about the Profumo affair,"" he said. ""She said what she thought,"" he continued. ""I think that honesty is very surprising."" He described Ms Keeler as a ""victim of the time"", adding that she would probably have had her own TV show had the scandal happened today. ""The interesting thing about her is she tried to escape it,"" he said. ""I don't think she ever got away from it - that was a tragedy."" ""She could never stop being Christine Keeler,"" he added. In 1963, Mr Profumo told the House of Commons he and Ms Keeler were ""on friendly terms"" and there was ""no impropriety"" in their relationship, after opposition MPs voiced concerns about national security implications. Eventually he admitted lying to the house and resigned as Secretary of State for War and from the Commons. Ms Keeler was briefly married twice, with both ending in divorce. She had two sons. The Profumo affair will be the subject of a BBC One drama which begins filming next year.

Himid in historic Turner Prize win,"The artist was congratulated by presenter Goldie and Tate director Maria Balshaw Lubaina Himid has become the oldest winner of the Turner Prize, and the first black woman to pick up the art award. The 63-year-old Zanzibar-born, Preston-based artist won the Â£25,000 prize for work addressing racial politics and the legacy of slavery. The judges praised her ""uncompromising tackling of issues including colonial history and how racism persists today"". She was named the winner at a ceremony in Hull, currently UK City of Culture. This video can not be played Lubaina Himid talks to the BBC about her win Described in Februaryby the Daily Telegraph,externalas ""the under-appreciated hero of black British art"", Himid made her name in the 1980s as one of the leaders of the British black arts movement - both painting and curating exhibitions of similarly overlooked artists. But she has now got the recognition she deserves. Her section of the Turner Prize exhibition in Hull contains work from the 1980s to today, including wooden figures, pottery and newspapers that she has painted on. The centrepiece is 1987's A Fashionable Marriage, based on William Hogarth's Marriage A-la Mode, which features a cast of cut-out characters including a flirting Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan. Himid's 1987 work A Fashionable Marriage was inspired by William Hogarth There are also porcelain dinner sets, found in junk shops. Himid has painted images of black slaves on some and aristocrats - some of whom are vomiting at the news of the abolition of slavery - on others. She has also painted over parts of newspaper pages to show how they ""used black people in a very subtle way which could be said to undermine their identity."" She is professor of contemporary art at the University of Central Lancashire and was made an MBE in 2010 for services to black women's art. She painted over pages of the Guardian in a comment on the way black people are depicted in the media The Turner Prize panel said they admired Himid's ""expansive and exuberant approach to painting which combines satire and a sense of theatre"". They also said they ""acknowledged her role as an influential curator and educator who continues to speak urgently to the moment"". Turner Prize is 'most diverse to date' Has the Turner Prize gone mainstream? Black artists break Turner age barrier This painting was inspired by the story of a slave ship on which all but one slave went blind Himid said she was ""thrilled"" to win, and thanked a list of long-time supporters in her acceptance speech. She said: ""To the art and cultural historians who cared enough to write essays about my work for decades - thank you, you gave me sustenance in the wilderness years."" Images relating to the slave trade painted on a 100-piece dinner service Lubaina Himid's Turner win is being put down to the well-documented rule change that did away with its 50-or-younger age restriction, which had been in place since 1991. Clearly, the 63-year-old artist wouldn't - couldn't - have won without the removal of the age cap. But there was another, less publicised rule change this year that also benefited her. For the first time the jurors were allowed to take into account the work each artist displayed in the Turner Prize exhibition. ""What?"" you may ask. ""Hasn't that always been the case? Why wouldn't they take the exhibition the public see - and therefore judge by - into account?"" Goodness knows why, but they didn't. Which might help explain some of the previous winners, and certainly makes sense of Himid receiving the contemporary art award for an exhibition packed with work she made some time ago. Her tableau A Fashionable Marriage, a satirical and political 1980s take on a scene from Hogarth's 18th Century series Marriage A-la Mode, was the single best work of art in the entire Turner Prize exhibition. It would have been a worthy winner when she made it in 1986 and - thanks to the rule change - it was a worthy winner last night. Speaking to BBC News afterwards, Himid said some of the art establishment was now catching up with her. ""I was overlooked by critics, by press, but I was never overlooked by art historians or curators or other artists,"" she said. She said her win probably wouldn't change people's perspectives and attitudes, but added: ""I think it will get people talking, which is the point of my work."" Asked how she would spend the Â£25,000 cheque, she said: ""I spend quite a lot of my money working with other artists, sometimes asking them to make things or helping them to make things when maybe they didn't get a grant or whatever. ""So I'll do a bit of that. And I'll buy some shoes."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

As well as Himid, 52-year-old Birmingham painter Hurvin Anderson made it on to this year's shortlist. Tate Britain director Alex Farquharson, who chaired this year's jury, said there was a desire to celebrate artists who had previously been neglected by the mainstream. And there was a very international feel to the shortlist, which also included Stuttgart-born Andrea Buttner and film-maker Rosalind Nashashibi, who was born in Croydon to Palestinian-Irish parents.

According to the BBC's North America technology reporter, Dave Lee, the prevention methods to stop under-age children using Facebook are ""trivial"", meaning more than 20 million under-13-year-olds are thought to be using the network. Messenger Kids is a simplified version of Facebook's existing messaging app which needs parents to approve any contacts added by their children. Once confirmed to be safe, friends can do live video chats, send pictures and text each other. The firm said it offered a more appropriate app, which parents could allow their children to use on tablets and smartphones. It has not responded directly to Mr Hunt's tweet, but in a  blog post, Facebook's Loren Cheng said the company had spoken to thousands of parents and dozens of experts in child development and online safety.

Two charged over takeaway meal death,"Megan Lee died two days after she was admitted to Royal Blackburn Hospital Two men have been charged with manslaughter over the death of a 15-year-old girl who suffered an allergic reaction to takeaway food. Megan Lee from Oswaldtwistle, Lancashire, died on 1 January, two days after she was admitted to hospital. She had eaten food from the Royal Spice takeaway in Hyndburn. Mohammed Kuddus, 39, of Blackburn and Harun Rashid, 38, of Haslingden are due to appear at Blackburn Magistrates' Court on 4 January. A post-mortem examination showed Megan died from acute asthma due to a nut allergy, Lancashire Police said. Royal Spice was temporarily closed by Hyndburn Council but is now trading under new ownership.

Hijab-row teen hits out at McDonald's,"A woman has criticised McDonald's after she was told to remove her hijab because it posed a ""security threat"". The 19-year-old Muslim student, who wants to remain anonymous, was approached by a security guard at a London branch of the fast food chain. McDonald's says it has suspended the security guard and is investigating the matter. It added that the restaurant was managed and owned by a franchisee. But the student toldBBC Asian Network,external""it's not enough"". ""They basically said that the security guard was employed by a third-party company and so what they're trying to say is, 'We don't condone his conduct but we can't be held responsible because we're not the people who hire them'. ""But if you're going to use a separate company you need to be aware of what kind of policies they have, especially in a city like London."" The student was with her friend Sabrina at the Holloway Road restaurant in north London on 30 November. In video footage recorded on her mobile phone, a black security guard can be heard saying: ""If you just don't mind taking it off,"" to which the 19-year-old responds: ""It's not just a matter of taking it off, I wear it for religious reasons and I'm not ashamed of it. ""I live down the street,"" she adds. ""This is a hate crime."" She told the BBC: ""You would expect someone of colour to be more sympathetic to a minority that is persecuted. ""That just reflects how current this issue is - almost anyone could actually believe that I am a security threat."" Sabrina shared the video on Twitter, and had an overwhelming response. ""A white British national... stood up for her,"" said Sabrina. ""People on social media were praising the man who defended her. ""As a non-hijab wearing Muslim, I recognise my privilege in society. ""Discrimination that I might face isn't necessarily as overt. ""For a quiet, peaceful life, I wouldn't wear it."" But her friend said she would not be deterred from wearing the hijab. ""If you want to dress modestly, you should have the right to dress modestly and it shouldn't be politicised,"" said the 19-year-old. ""It's my choice. If I want to cover my hair, I should have the right to cover my hair."" McDonald's UK chief executive Paul Pomroy said in a statement: ""I am deeply sorry that this happened, and am taking the matter very seriously. ""We welcome people of all faiths and do not have any policy which restricts or prevents anyone wearing a hijab, or any other religious attire, in our restaurants. ""The restaurant involved is managed and owned by Amir Atefi, a franchisee. ""Mr Atefi is proud of his diverse workforce, and was upset and concerned to hear how one of his valued customers has been treated.""

Mid-East alarm after Trump Jerusalem calls,"Abdul Fattah al-Sisi of Egypt (left) and Saudi King Salman (centre) are among those to voice concern Arab leaders have warned US President Donald Trump that moving the American embassy in Israel to Jerusalem could have dangerous repercussions. Mr Trump phoned several regional leaders on Tuesday to tell them he intended to move it from Tel Aviv. Saudi Arabia's King Salman told the US leader that any such move would provoke Muslims around the world. The calls came amid speculation that Mr Trump could recognise Jerusalem as Israel's capital on Wednesday. He is scheduled to deliver remarks and White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said he was ""pretty solid"" in his thinking on the issue. The city's fate is one of the thorniest issues between Israel and the Palestinians. If Washington recognises Jerusalem as Israel's capital, it would be the first country to do so since the foundation of the state in 1948. The alternatives to a two-state solution Why settlement issue is so difficult King Salman told Mr Trump that the relocation of the embassy or recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital ""would constitute a flagrant provocation of Muslims, all over the world"", the official Saudi Press Agency reported. Meanwhile, US government employees and their families have been barred from personal travel in Jerusalem's Old City and the West Bank for security reasons ahead of planned protests. In other reaction from leaders who spoke to Mr Trump: Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas ""warned of the dangerous consequences such a decision would have to the peace process and to the peace, security and stability of the region and of the world"" Jordan's King Abdullah said the decision would ""undermine efforts to resume the peace process"" and provoke Muslims. Jordan acts as custodian of the Islamic sites in Jerusalem Egypt's President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi urged Mr Trump ""not to complicate the situation in the region"" Official statements from the Palestinian Authority and Jordan confirmed that Mr Abbas and King Abdullah were told of Mr Trump's intention to move the embassy, while the Saudi reports did not say so explicitly. None of the leaders said if Mr Trump had specified when the embassy move would take place. He promised the move during his campaign for the presidency. Israel regards Jerusalem as its ""eternal and undivided"" capital, while the Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a future Palestinian state. Reports suggest Mr Trump will sign a waiver to keep the embassy in Tel Aviv for six more months, while committing to a move. The White House only said the president discussed potential decisions regarding Jerusalem with all the Middle East leaders he spoke to on Tuesday, including Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Earlier, Turkey's president Recep Tayyip Erdogan warned his country could sever ties with Israel if the US recognised Jerusalem as its capital. Ismail Haniya, the chief of the Islamist Hamas group that runs Gaza, said a shift of the embassy and recognition of Jerusalem as the Israeli capital would cross ""every red line"". What makes Jerusalem so holy? France, the European Union and the Arab League have also spoken out to express concern. Israel's intelligence minister Israel Katz told Army Radio that he expected Mr Trump would recognise Jerusalem as his country's capital and said that Israel was ""preparing for every option"", including an outbreak of violence. The status of Jerusalem goes to the heart of Israel's conflict with the Palestinians, who are backed by the rest of the Arab and wider Islamic world. The city is home to key religious sites sacred to Judaism, Islam and Christianity, especially in East Jerusalem. Israel occupied the sector, previously occupied by Jordan, in the 1967 Middle East war and regards the entire city as its indivisible capital. The Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a future state, and according to 1993 Israel-Palestinian peace accords, its final status is meant to be discussed in the latter stages of peace talks. Israeli sovereignty over Jerusalem has never been recognised internationally, and all countries, including Israel's closest ally the US, maintain their embassies in Tel Aviv. Israel sees Jerusalem as its indivisible capital; Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a future state Since 1967, Israel has built a dozen settlements, home to about 200,000 Jews, in East Jerusalem. These are considered illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this. If the US recognises Jerusalem as Israel's capital, it would reinforce Israel's position that settlements in the east are valid Israeli communities.

'Five injured' in German train collision,"More than 40 people have been injured in a train crash near the German city of DÃ¼sseldorf, emergency services say. A passenger train collided with a freight train near the town of Meerbusch, in North Rhine-Westphalia, on Tuesday night. Of 173 people on board, seven people were badly injured and one suffered serious injuries, the Meerbusch fire department said. Another 33 people had minor injuries and 132 were unhurt, it added. The fire department's operation finished at around 02:20 (00:20 GMT). All passengers had left the train in a rescue operation that at its peak involved 400 people, it said. Casualty estimates escalated rapidly overnight from an early figure of about five people. Rescue efforts were hindered by a broken cable which ""posed a risk of electric shock to persons outside the train"". The accident occurred at about 19:30, according to a statement from Germany's state-owned railway group, Deutsche Bahn. The train, operated by a subsidiary of Britain's National Express bus company, apparently collided with a stationary cargo train on the track. A spokesman for the company told Germany's Bild newspaper that the driver had hit the emergency brake when he saw the other vehicle on the track.

Manchester attack 'could have been stopped',"Police lay flowers after the Manchester Arena attack The Manchester Arena bomber had been a ""subject of interest"" and opportunities to stop him were missed, a review says. Its author, David Anderson QC, said it was conceivable Salman Abedi's attack, which killed 22 people, could have been avoided had ""cards fallen differently"". But he said it was ""unknowable"" whether reopening investigations into Abedi would have thwarted his plans, adding: ""MI5 assesses that it would not."" Greater Manchester Police said its officers would ""never stop learning"". After the Manchester bombing and three terror attacks in London this year, counter-terror police and MI5 conducted internal reviews. Mr Anderson carried out an independent assessments of their findings. The reviews, which remain largely secret, are summarised inMr Anderson's report,,externaland show: Abedi had been a ""Subject of Interest"" for MI5 - meaning someone they were investigating - between January and July 2014, and then again in October 2015 On two occasions in the months before Abedi attacked, MI5 received intelligence, but its significance was not fully appreciated at the time and, in hindsight, was ""highly relevant"" to the planned attack Abedi was identified by MI5 as one of ""a few dozen"" people who needed further consideration. The meeting to do that was due to take place on 31 May, nine days after the attack There was no security service port alert against Abedi, so he was not questioned at the border when he returned to the UK from Libya four days before the attack Salman Abedi was named by police as the suicide bomber shortly after the attack in Manchester The reviews also showed the two other attackers who had been on MI5's radar were Khuram Butt, the leader of theLondon Bridge and Borough Market attack,and Khalid Masood who targetedWestminster Bridge in March. Butt had been identified by MI5 and the police as someone who wanted to attack the UK two years earlier. He was still a ""live subject of interest"" who was under investigation at the time of the attack, though more for his intention to travel to Syria and for radicalising others. He was also the main target of ""Operation Hawthorn"" - but this was suspended twice because of a lack of resources after the Bataclan attack in Paris and the Westminster Bridge attack. Operation Hawthorn had resumed and was running on the day Butt attacked. This video can not be played David Anderson QC: ""Opportunities missed"" to stop Manchester attack Mr Anderson, a former independent reviewer of terror legislation, said: ""Despite elevated threat levels, the fundamentals are sound and the great majority of attacks continue to be thwarted. ""But the shock of these incidents has prompted intensive reflection and a commitment to significant change. ""In particular, MI5 and the police have identified the need to use data more effectively, to share knowledge more widely, to improve their own collaboration and to assess and investigate terrorist threats on a uniform basis, whatever the ideology that inspires them."" Could MI5 really have stopped the attacks? By Dominic Casciani, BBC home affairs correspondent It says not - but Mr Anderson believes there were opportunities. Given the scale of terrorism-related activity since 2013 - when the Syria crisis gave a boost to recruitment in the UK - there is no doubt that the security service has been juggling a huge numbers of cases. The real question is whether the manpower is matched with the right data tools and relationships with other bodies to stop more of the threats before it is too late. Data analysis will play an increasingly important role in trying to spot individuals who may pose a threat after years of being quiet. Perhaps the most important change to come is that MI5 may be told to share some of what it knows with other agencies - such as local councils - in the hope that people on the ground can provide the missing piece of information they need to disrupt a threat. This raises huge cultural challenges for an organisation that necessarily operates below the radar. Read more of Dominic's analysis Some relatives of victims have given their views on the report. Steve Goodman, whose step-granddaughter 15-year-old Olivia Campbell-Hardy was killed in the blast, said: ""The police were doing their jobs as best they could. ""Unfortunately information is not always reliable."" Dan Hett lost his brother Martyn, 29, in the explosion. In a series of tweets said he could not ""fathom how complicated modern antiterrorism intelligence is"". He added that the positive aspects of the emergency services' response should also be highlighted. A man in a hired car drove into pedestrianson Westminster Bridge then stabbed a police officer outside Parliament on 22 March A suicide bomber targeted young peopleat the end of a concert by US singer Ariana Grande at Manchester Arena on 22 May A van hit pedestrianson London Bridge before three men got out and stabbed people in nearby Borough Market on 3 June A group of Muslim worshippers were hitwhen a van mounted the pavement and drove into them in Finsbury Park, in north London, on 19 June The home secretary said nine terror attacks had been prevented in the UK since the Westminster attack in March. In a statement to the Commons, Ms Rudd said MI5 and the police had made 126 recommendations. These included issues such as data sharing and analysis and how so-called ""closed subjects"" should be managed, as well as a new approach to managing domestic extremism, particularly of right-wing groups. ""We will shortly be announcing the budgets for policing for 2017-18, and I am clear that we must ensure counter terrorism policing has the resources needed to deal with the threats that we face,"" she told MPs. Mr Anderson's predecessor Lord Carlile said the 126 recommendations should be ""put into effect as soon as possible"". The Met Police said the number of dangerous, radicalised individuals was ""a major issue"". Commissioner Cressida Dick said her force needed ""to make rapid progress in implementing the recommendations, many of which require new technology, better infrastructures and resources"". Following the publication of the report, the prime minister's spokesman said the government would pay Â£9.8m in special funding to Greater Manchester Police, in relation to its response to the Manchester Arena bombing. The Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham said the report would be difficult reading for the people of his city. ""It is clear that things could, and perhaps should, have been done differently and that wrong judgements have been made,"" he said. But, he said, it should reassure the public to know MI5 were closing in on Abedi. It would be much more worrying if nothing had been known about the attack, he added. Chris Phillips, a former head of the National Counter Terrorism Security Office, said: ""When you look back, within terrorism, you will always find some way that we could have stopped something. ""I always equate it to spinning plates. They've got hundreds and thousands of plates spinning at any given time. ""Someone has to make some risk-assessed decisions as to who is at the top of the pile to be watched.""

Mueller 'demands Trump German bank data',"Robert Mueller is investigating alleged links between the Trump campaign and Russia US special counsel Robert Mueller has ordered Germany's Deutsche Bank to provide records of accounts held by Donald Trump, according to reports. Mr Mueller issued a subpoena to the bank several weeks ago demanding the transaction data, Reuters news agency and a German newspaper say. He is investigating alleged collusion between the Trump presidential campaign and Russia. However, a lawyer for the US president denied the reports. ""We have confirmed that the news reports that the special counsel had subpoenaed financial records relating to the president are false,"" attorney Jay Sekulow told Reuters in a statement. ""No subpoena has been issued or received. We have confirmed this with the bank and other sources."" US investigators are said to be demanding information on dealings linked to Mr Trump as part of an investigation into alleged Russian influence,externalin the US presidential election, according to Handelsblatt and Reuters. Deutsche Bank, one of the Trump Organization's major lenders on its real estate projects, said it would not comment on any of its individual clients. However in a statement to NBC News, it said: ""[Our bank] takes its legal obligations seriously and remains committed to co-operating with authorised investigations into this matter."" In June, Germany's largest bank rejected requests for account records by Democrats in the US House of Representatives to provide details of the president's finances, citing privacy laws. How Trump's Russia trouble unfolded What will Robert Mueller do? Mueller 'is ramrod straight in integrity' Russia: The 'cloud' over the Trump White House Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC News North America Reporter Until now, Robert Mueller has appeared to be operating on the periphery of President Trump - focusing on former campaign chairman Paul Manafort's previous foreign lobbying efforts, the Russian contacts of George Papadopoulos, a relatively minor foreign policy adviser, and the post-election actions of Mr Trump's confidant Michael Flynn. While the charges are serious, the president himself has been removed from the most heated prosecutorial action. That all changes if the Deutsche Bank reports are true. The German institution, which also has ties to Russian oligarchs, was a lifeline for the Trump Organization's businesses in the early 2000s, when US lenders turned their backs on the then-struggling business tycoon. How closely did Mr Trump and his associates follow the letter of the law at a time before he was a serious political candidate? The president's defenders will argue that his past business dealings are not relevant to the special counsel inquiry, tasked with probing possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 presidential election. A high-stakes showdown over whether Mr Mueller is exceeding his mandate could be brewing. As special counsel Mr Mueller, who headed the FBI for more than a decade, has the powers to subpoena records and bring criminal charges. He can also prosecute anyone who interferes in his investigation through crimes including perjury, obstruction of justice, destruction of evidence and intimidation of witnesses. Mr Mueller's office has so far spent about $3.2m (Â£2.4m) on attorneys, special agents and other expenses,externalas part of its investigation, the US Department of Justice revealed in a report on Tuesday. US intelligence agencies have concluded that Moscow tried to sway the presidential election in favour of Mr Trump. It is alleged that Russian hackers stole information linked to the campaign of his rival Hillary Clinton and passed it to Wikileaks so it could be released to undermine her. Mr Trump has repeatedly denied any collusion with Russia, calling the allegations a ""witch hunt"". Four people have so far been charged by Mr Mueller over alleged links between Moscow and the Trump team. October 2017:Mr Trump's former campaign chairmanPaul Manafortand his business associateRick Gatesare charged with 12 counts of money laundering, undisclosed foreign lobbying, and lying to government investigators over alleged links to pro-Russian groups in Ukraine (both deny the charges) October 2017:It emerges thatGeorge Papadopouloshas pleaded guilty to lying to FBI investigators about his contacts with Russian nationals and connected individuals while he was serving as a foreign policy advisor with the Trump campaign December 2017: Michael Flynn, the former general who was briefly Mr Trump's national security adviser, pleads guilty to making ""false, fictitious and fraudulent statements"" to the FBI about his contact with a Russian official.

Thai speedboat deaths 'preventable',"Survivors were pulled from the sea after the boat capsized The deaths of two Britons in a Thai boat crash could ""have been prevented"", the husband of one has said. Monica O'Connor, 28, and Jason Parnell, 46, drowned afterthe speedboat capsized in monsoon conditions near the island of Koh Samui in May 2016. Delivering a narrative conclusion, coroner Alison Mutch said the captain's decision to ignore weather warnings contributed to their deaths. After the hearing, Tim O'Connor said his wife's death was ""tragic"". The couple, from Sale in Greater Manchester, had been on their honeymoon, while Mr Parnell, from Sileby in Leicestershire, was celebrating his first wedding anniversary. Thirty-two people were on board when the crash - in which a German and a Chinese national also died - occurred off the coast of Thailand. The inquest heardsmall boats were warned not to sailby Thailand's meteorological department. The hearing was also told the boat's passengers had been given no safety advice, there was no individual allocation of life jackets and a decision was made to sail the boat too close to the shore. Boat captain Sanan Sridakeow was jailed for a year, and operator Limited Partnership Angthong Discovery Tour was fined 15,000 Thai baht (Â£342) after admitting recklessness. Tim and Monica O'Connor were on honeymoon in Koh Samui when the boat capsized Recording a narrative conclusion, the senior coroner for South Manchester Alison Mutch said they ""died as a result of drowning, contributed to by the decision to operate the tour when a known weather warning was in force"". She added that she was ""truly sorry that what should have been memorable holidays in the most positive and happy ways ended in the ways they did"".

John Oliver confronts Hoffman over harassment,"Dustin Hoffman has said he has ""the utmost respect for women"" John Oliver has confronted Dustin Hoffman in a tense public discussion about allegations of sexual harassment that have been made against the actor. Hoffman defended himself after Anna Graham Hunter alleged he groped her on a film set when she was 17, in 1985. The actor questioned Ms Graham Hunter's claims, asking Oliver: ""Do you believe this stuff that you're reading?"" Hoffman said the HBO talk show host was not keeping an ""open mind"" and was unquestionably believing the accusers. ""I believe what she wrote, yes,"" Oliver replied. ""Because there's no point in her lying."" The actor countered: ""Well, there's a point in her not bringing it up for 40 years."" Oliver was hosting a panel discussion in New York to mark the 20th anniversary of Hoffman's film Wag The Dog. Oliver said he wasn't sure whether to broach the subject of the allegations but decided he'd end up ""hating myself"" if he didn't. The tetchy exchange was reported by The Washington Post,external, which also posted a video of part of the conversation. Dustin Hoffman accused of harassment Harassment in Hollywood: who's been accused? Ms Graham Hunter published her account of her encounters with Hoffman - including diary entries she said she had written at the time in which she accused him of being a ""dirty old man"" -in The Hollywood Reporter in November,external. The veteran star responded at the time by putting out a statement saying: ""I have the utmost respect for women and feel terrible that anything I might have done could have put her in an uncomfortable situation. ""I am sorry. It is not reflective of who I am."" Oliver picked him up on that line at Monday's public question-and-answer session - saying he wasn't satisfied with it because ""it is reflective of who you were"". Oliver hosts HBO's Last Week Tonight with John Oliver He went on: ""If it happened and you've given no evidence to show it didn't happen then there was a period of time for a while when you were a creeper around women. ""So it feels like a cop-out to say, 'It wasn't me.' Do you understand how that feels like a dismissal?"" Hoffman replied: ""It's difficult to answer that question. You weren't there."" Oliver retorted: ""I'm glad."" According to The Washington Post, Hoffman accused Oliver of making an ""incredible assumption about me"", adding sarcastically: ""You've made the case better than anyone else can. I'm guilty."" Ms Graham Hunter worked as an intern on Hoffman's 1985 TV movie Death of A Salesman. ""I still don't know who this woman is,"" Hoffman said on Monday. ""I never met her. If I met her it was in concert with other people."" The paper's video also showed Hoffman explaining that it was normal to talk about subjects like sex within the close-knit confines of the film crew, who he said were like ""a family"". He said: ""I said a stupid thing but I said it in the midst of the crew, and they said their stupid things. But they were sexual in terms of the humour of it. But that's 40 years ago."" Hoffman described touching his The Graduate co-star Katharine Ross on the bottom as ""nothing"" Hoffman also told a story about touching his The Graduate co-star Katharine Ross on the bottom during rehearsals - an act he played down, describing it as ""nothing"". She became angry, Hoffman explained but described that as ""an overreaction"", saying that she later apologised. The discussion comes as Hollywood grapples with how to clean up its act amid allegations against a string of stars and executives, and was a rare example of one of those men being challenged in public.

First tax havens blacklist published by EU,"Saint Lucia is on the EU's 17 ""non-cooperative jurisdictions"" The European Union has published its first blacklist of tax havens, naming 17 territories including Saint Lucia, Barbados and South Korea. A ""watchlist"" of 47 countries promising to change their tax rules to meet EU standards has also been issued. The ""grey list"" includes several with UK links, including Hong Kong, Jersey, Bermuda and the Cayman Islands, as well as Switzerland and Turkey. Both lists,externalhave been criticised as omitting the most notorious tax havens. The lists follow the leaking of the Panama Papers and the Paradise Papers, revealing how companies and individuals hid their wealth from tax authorities around the world in offshore accounts. EU tax commissioner Pierre Moscovici said the blacklist represented ""substantial progress"", adding: ""Its very existence is an important step forward. But because it is the first EU list, it remains an insufficient response to the scale of tax evasion worldwide."" How much of the world's wealth is hidden offshore? Panama Papers: full coverage To determine whether a country is a ""non-cooperative jurisdiction"" the EU index measures the transparency of its tax regime, tax rates and whether the tax system encourages multinationals to unfairly shift profits to low tax regimes to avoid higher duties in other states. In particular these include tax systems that offer incentives such as 0% corporate tax to foreign companies. EU members have been left to decide what action to take against the offenders. Ministers ruled out imposing a withholding tax on transactions to tax havens as well as other financial sanctions. Some states, such as Luxembourg and Malta, opposed stricter sanctions, according to officials. EU Commission Vice-President Valdis Dombrovskis said ""stronger countermeasures would have been preferable"". Panama is one of the 17 countries listed by the EU but its president, Juan Carlos Varela, said the country was ""not in any way a tax haven"". Panama is on the EU's tax havens blacklist The EU is encouraging member states to take what it calls ""defensive actions"" against those countries that do not reform their tax systems. The UK-based charity Oxfam last week published its own list of 35 countries that it said should be blacklisted. Oli Pearce, Oxfam's inequality and tax policy advisor, said: ""It is disturbing to see mostly small countries on the EU blacklist, while the most notorious tax havens - UK-linked places like Bermuda, the Cayman Islands, Jersey and the Virgin Islands - escape with a place on the 'grey list'. ""Although we recognise this is a step in the right direction, if EU leaders let too many tax havens off the hook we'll all lose out. A place on the grey list must not mean tax havens get off scot-free."" However, tax campaigner Richard Murphy said some countries on the grey list could still face heavy sanctions if they failed to reform their tax systems. He said EU countries will be encouraged to disallow payments made to these places for tax purposes, or to charge withholding taxes on interest payments to them. That tactic could ""utterly neuter their so-called status as 'tax neutral international  financial centres' by ensuring that all monies they receive have been taxed before getting there"", Mr Murphy said. ""The EU is also saying to the UK that it is taking real measures against British Overseas Territories and Crown Dependencies, and the message is - if you go the same way as them with a similar low-tax regime after Brexit, you'll be sanctioned too."" The 17 blacklisted territories are: American Samoa Bahrain Barbados Grenada Guam South Korea Macau The Marshall Islands Mongolia Namibia Palau Panama Saint Lucia Samoa Trinidad and Tobago Tunisia United Arab Emirates The EU made exceptions for countries faced with natural disasters such as hurricanes, and put the process temporarily on hold.

Labour attacks 'embarrassing' Brexit talks,"This video can not be played Labour: May to blame for Brexit 'embarrassment' Ministers say no part of the UK will be treated differently in the Brexit talks as Labour branded their approach an ""embarrassment"". No agreement has been reached with the EU after a DUP backlash against proposals for the Irish border. Brexit Secretary David Davis told MPs the government was close to concluding the first phase of talks. DUP leader Arlene Foster said the text of the deal was a ""big shock"" and ""it was not going to be acceptable."" She told the Republic of Ireland national broadcaster RTÃ that her party only saw the text on Monday morning, despite asking to see it for five weeks. Theresa May, speaking as she welcomed Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy to Downing Street, said talks with the EU had "" made a lot of progress"". ""There are still a couple of issues we need to work on. But we'll be reconvening in Brussels later this week as we look ahead to the December European Council,"" she said. The phone call that never was Mark Devenport: The Brexit linguistic hole Dublin 'to give May space' on Brexit Ruth Davidson: The deal should be UK-wide Mrs Foster was invited to hold talks with Mrs May in London on Tuesday, but the party's Westminster leader met the government's chief whip instead. The meeting lasted for several hours, but sources suggested to the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg that there was not much sign of a breakthrough yet, with a DUP insider saying the deal needed ""radical surgery"", rather than a few word changes. A phone call between Mrs May and Mrs Foster had then been expected this evening, but sources added that it would not go ahead, suggesting it had never been arranged. This video can not be played Citizens' rights, the Irish border and money are the three big negotiation points The UK is due to leave the EU in March 2019 and Mrs May is under pressure to reach agreement on the Northern Ireland border so negotiations can move forward. The prime minister needs the support of the DUP - the Democratic Unionist Party - which is Northern Ireland's largest party and has 10 MPs at Westminster, because she does not have a majority to win votes in the House of Commons. Responding to an urgent question from Labour in the Commons on Tuesday, Mr Davis defended the controversial proposal for ""regulatory alignment"" between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland - intended to avoid the need for border checks after Brexit - saying this would apply to the whole of the UK. The DUP is unhappy about any agreement which treats Northern Ireland differently. Arlene Foster: We waited five weeks to see draft 'I cannot believe there won't be an agreement' The issue threatening to derail Brexit It would not mean ""having exactly the same rules"" as the EU, Mr Davis said, but would involve ""sometimes having mutually recognised rules"". Backbencher Jacob Rees-Mogg warned that having ""regulatory divergence"" from the EU after Brexit was a ""red line"". This video can not be played Davis: We are making Brexit progress Labour's Brexit spokesman Sir Keir Starmer said that when the DUP objected to the draft agreement, ""fantasy met brutal reality"", adding: ""The DUP tail is wagging the Tory dog."" Mr Starmer also called for the government to drop its plan to enshrine the 29 March 2019 Brexit date in UK law. Meanwhile, former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith suggested the UK should walk away from the negotiations if the EU does not change its position. This video can not be played Iain Duncan Smith: EU needs to 'back off' or 'move on' But Tory MP and former cabinet minister, Nicky Morgan, said his comments were ""madness"" and walking away would ""betrays the futures of millions of young people and those who never wanted to leave in the first place"".

The DUP has said ""it is not a question of us budging"" as the talks were between the UK and the EU Dublin - which as an EU member is part of its single market and customs union - has been calling for written guarantees that a ""hard border"" involving customs checks on the island of Ireland will be avoided after Brexit It is concerned this could undermine the 1998 peace treaty - theGood Friday Agreementthat brought an end to 30 years of sectarian conflict in Northern Ireland. Mr Davis said that while the ""integrity"" of the single market and customs union must be respected after Brexit, it was ""equally clear we must respect the integrity of the United Kingdom"" and individual nations could not have separate arrangements. Mrs May needs to show ""sufficient progress"" has been made so far on ""divorce"" issues before European leaders meet on 14 December to decide whether to allow talks on future trade relations to begin. The three issues that need to be resolved are the Northern Ireland border, citizens' rights and the amount of money the UK will pay as it leaves. Brexitcast: Listen to the BBC's podcast special European press sees May on 'razor edge' Talks between Mrs May and European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker broke up without agreement on Monday, after the DUP objected to a draft agreement on the future of the Irish border. Key to the row is how closely aligned Northern Ireland's regulations will be with those of the Republic of Ireland, and the rest of the EU, in order to avoid a ""hard"" border. This video can not be played Irish PM Leo Varadkar said he was ""surprised and disappointed"" Ireland's deputy prime minister Simon Coveney said Dublin would not budge from its position on the border. The EU is treating the row as a ""domestic British political issue"", BBC Brussels correspondent Adam Fleming said. ""The show is now in London,"" said a European Commission spokesman. Downing Street has insisted the border was not the only outstanding problem and disagreement remains over the role of the European Court of Justice in overseeing EU citizens' rights in the UK after Brexit.

Kuenssberg: Can May fix it?,"It is not clear if the DUP saw the final wording of the agreement on the Irish border It is pretty clear how it all went wrong yesterday. But as we left Brussels in the pitch black this morning we're still in the dark about what happens next, and how Theresa May can get this whole process back on track, and smartish. While it's not the end of the potential overall deal if the two sides can't move on to the next phase of talks at the summit next week, it is what both sides desperately want. The longer it takes, the more risk there is of course of other parts of yesterday's draft being unpicked. The idea was, remember, to lock in the agreement so far, then get on with the rest. It isn't clear what happens next though. May under pressure to get DUP on side No misunderstanding of Brexit text - DUP Ireland 'disappointed' at no deal on Brexit There are some big political and practical questions to ask. (If you are not very interested in the minutiae of all of this, look away now.... but guess what, it's not just about a fight with her allies in Northern Ireland, but her friends and rivals around the cabinet table too). 1. How can Theresa May get the DUP back on board quickly? There is a dispute over whether or not they had seen the full text of the draft agreement yesterday. Some sources say they hadn't seen the whole thing, therefore they hadn't seen the full context of what was being said, and flew off the handle over the initial leaks from Brussels over what had been agreed, the UK government ""conceding"" on the border as MEPs outside the Commission building told us before May even arrived. While it's clear the DUP was in close contact with the government it is possible to believe they hadn't seen the whole text complete with the caveats, because even senior officials involved in the talks weren't allowed to have electronic copies of the document, only hard copies. And as there had been lots and lots of changes to the text over the weekend, it's not impossible to imagine that the final, final, final version that then emerged had not been shown in full to the DUP. Others in government suggest the DUP had seen it all, and as we reported last night, the Tory chief whip told the PM it was all signed off. If that's the case, it is a much bigger political problem of trust for the PM, if the DUP had been kept in the loop and given their approval, but then threw their toys out of the pram. It's not clear whether the PM and Arlene Foster will meet in the next couple of days in person, but from late last night talks between the two sides were under way. But with such strong objections on the record now, it is very difficult to see how the DUP can just say, ok then prime minister, when we said we couldn't back it, we really meant that we could, unless there is a change in the language in the text that has already taken weeks of painful negotiation to agree. It's said there are three different policy options that could provide a fix, but this feels more like a battle of wills. And don't forget, there are a number of Tory MPs who agree with them. The idea of close ""alignment"", is anathema to some Conservative Brexiteers too. There is however a very big difference between allowing Northern Ireland to choose to keep cooperating in some sectors and write that into the deal, and imposing a much bigger change where it essentially stands alone from the rest of the UK, and is pushed much closer to the EU. 2. This morning it feels pretty much impossible for the other side, Dublin, to back down in any way. Irish leader Leo Varadkar, who is in the middle of a political whirlwind of his own, went public yesterday to make it clear that there was indeed an agreed text, and that there was no way that it could be unpicked. Beyond the reassurances on policy that the Irish so desired, to change tack politically and suddenly give back the concessions that appear to have been so hard won seems extremely unlikely to happen. 3. It's worth pondering too whether the EU pushed the Republic of Ireland, or the Republic of Ireland pushed the EU, too hard? The last week or so have been the moment of maximum leverage for the Republic of Ireland and they have squeezed every drop out of it. But if, with the EU's backing, they have pushed May into an impossible trap, no one will win. Several weeks ago a senior government official suggested to me that we should be worried about France and Germany underestimating the PM's political difficulties. If the calculus became impossible for her to stay at the table, there was, they feared, no guaranteed way of her being being able to ""get back in the harness"". Because we are leaving the EU, the old expectations that the UK will always be able to keep talking, to keep going, don't apply any more. 4. Is the only way out then for the prime minister to face down her allies? Perhaps, indeed, but why didn't she do that yesterday? There was not due to be a vote in Parliament on the suggested deal at the end of phase one. There was no moment on this specific issue when she required the DUP's backing. Northern Ireland is yet to receive the bulk of the billion that was promised to them after the DUP did a deal with the government. One insider wondered aloud yesterday why she just hadn't dared them to take her on. The DUP will try to max out its influence at every stage and won't give up easily. The government knows how hard they can negotiate, after they spun out their confidence and supply agreement with No 10 over many days in the summer. But when the stakes are high, the one thing the Northern Ireland contingent truly don't want is a Jeremy Corbyn government. And if Brexit is completely derailed, arguably that risk for the DUP and the Tories moves into view. And above all, if all the PM has really promised is voluntary alignment in some sectors that shouldn't be hypothetically impossible to agree, if she really demands it. 5.The amount of trouble the prime minister is in also depends what the cabinet demands to know this morning, and what the promises over ""alignment"" really amounted to. While the crucial paragraphs over the Irish border did emerge into the public, the text of the whole document is still a secret. The suspicion in some circles is that Theresa May and Olly Robbins, her top EU official, might have been suggesting that ""regulatory alignment"", where the rules in the UK mirror very closely those in the EU, was an option, not just for Northern Ireland, but for the rest of the country, or at least some sectors of the economy. That had not been scoped out by the Brexit department, it's suggested, let alone signed off by the cabinet. Round that table, be in no doubt, there are very different views over how close the UK's ""alignment"" should be. If Brexiteers Michael Gove, Boris Johnson and others feel this morning that the prime minister somehow tried to bounce them into agreeing to a future outside the EU where the UK was permanently bound tightly to Brussels, expect fireworks at home. That could end up being much more troublesome for Theresa May than the behaviour of the Northern Ireland party whose votes she needs. No 10 sources say the suggestions that the PM wants alignment for the whole of the UK are wide of the mark. But Brexiteers are likely to demand reassurance.

Devenport: A linguistic hole,"DUP leader Arlene Foster last week declared that her party was ""in constant contact"" on Brexit issues with the government ""Rubbish"" - the response from a senior DUP source when I put it to them that the party had been kept in the loop about Theresa May's Brexit deal, but got cold feet when the likes of Nicola Sturgeon, Carwyn Jones and Sadiq Khan started demanding the same special treatment for Scotland, Wales and London. Something doesn't add up. Last Thursday, DUP leader Arlene Foster declared that her party was ""in constant contact on these issues with the government"". Was that via face-to-face meetings of the two parties' ""co-ordination committee"", or just via telephone conversations? If the latter, the line must have been very crackly. Irish 'to give May space' on Brexit Difficult days ahead as DUP says 'no' Long read: The hardest border Reality check: How much trade is there between UK and Ireland But also last Thursday,the DUP loudly and publicly denounced a report in The Timeswhich talked about the devolution of extra powers to Stormont and hinted at the possibility of customs convergence. It wasn't exactly what the Eurocrats were working on in their draft texts. However, the similarity of the proposals and the vehemence of the DUP reaction should surely have alerted the negotiators to sound out the DUP first, rather than bouncing them into accepting a fait accompli. How to get out of this hole? The diplomats could try raiding a thesaurus to find synonyms for ""regulatory alignment"", although the DUP will now be on their guard for any cosmetic change which does not alter the thrust of the draft UK-EU agreement. Earlier, another DUP source told me unionists just wanted to be treated the same as the rest of the UK. If regulations on animal health or agriculture are good enough for Northern Ireland, went the argument, then why not for the UK as a whole? Negotiations between the UK and UK broke up without a deal on Monday The DUP's critics are quick to point out that the party has been prepared to contemplate different regimes for corporation tax, air passenger duty and water charges. Not to mention that it doesn't back a ""one-size-fits-all"" UK-wide policy on abortion or same-sex marriage. Putting all that to one side for the purpose of this Brexit negotiation, one obvious way to resolve the current conundrum might be for the government to pledge that any ""regulatory alignment"" between Northern Ireland and the European Union will also apply across the UK. Such a wider east-west deal would not offend the DUP's unionist sensibilities, although it might create tensions between Theresa May and some of her Conservative Brexit purists. So you could widen out the deal. However, another approach might be to narrow down its terms. The draft text referred to ""regulatory alignment"" in areas relevant to the Good Friday Agreement (the 1998 deal that brought to an end the 30 years of sectarian conflict in Northern Ireland). That is open to interpretation - some say the EU provided the entire context in which the 1998 Agreement was negotiated. By contrast the UK Supreme Court ruled that Brexit was not in breach of the Agreement. We have had north-south ""areas of cooperation"" for the past 19 years. Transport is one of them, but drivers still need to stick to speed limits in kilometres south of the border and in miles per hour on the north. Tourism is another area of cooperation, but airport bosses in Northern Ireland will remind you that their passengers pay duty which the Irish Republic abolished some time ago. Tourism is one key area of north-south cooperation So simply saying the magic words ""Good Friday Agreement"" doesn't mean every rule and regulation has to be the same. Two different forms of words are now doing the rounds. Leaks from Brussels on Monday claimed a draft text said: ""In the absence of agreed solutions, the UK will ensure that continued regulatory alignment with those rules of the internal market and the customs union which, now or in the future, support north-south cooperation and the protection of the Good Friday Agreement."" This would be open to the UK government to parse on the grounds of which rules are relevant to that agreement. The Irish Times has reported another formula which has apparently been disputed by the British government. It says: ""The UK remains committed to protecting north-south co-operation and a guarantee to avoiding a hard border. ""The UK's intention is to achieve these objectives through the overall EU-UK relationship. ""Should this not be possible, the UK will propose specific solutions to address the unique circumstances of the island of Ireland. ""In the absence of agreed solutions, the UK will maintain full alignment with the internal market, customs union and protection of the Good Friday agreement."" This appears more a comprehensive text, less open to interpretation and potentially creating an internal customs barrier within a post-Brexit UK. So does the government widen the playing field across the UK or try to narrow the terms of the text dealing with Ireland? Either way it's quite a challenge to rescue this deal.

Damian Green 'must retract lie claim',"A former senior police officer has demanded cabinet minister Damian Green publicly retracts a claim that he lied about pornography being found on a computer in the MP's office in 2008. Bob Quick said he would consider legal action against the first secretary of state if he did not do so. In a tweet, Mr Green had described Mr Quick as ""untrustworthy"" and accused him of making ""untrue"" allegations. Mr Green denies downloading or watching pornography on his work computers. In a statement issued by his lawyers, Mr Quick said: ""Damian Green called me a liar in the statement he tweeted on 4 November 2017. That is completely untrue. ""Everything I have said is accurate, in good faith, and in the firm belief that I have acted in the public interest."" He added: ""I am in no way motivated politically and bear no malice whatsoever to Damian Green. ""This is despite unfortunate and deeply hurtful attempts to discredit me."" When he was assistant commissioner of London's Metropolitan Police Service, Mr Quick led an inquiry into Home Office leaks, which saw Mr Green's Commons office being searched in 2008. Having resigned in 2009, Mr Quick made the allegations last month after the Cabinet Office launched an investigation into accusations of inappropriate behaviour by Mr Green towards journalist Kate Maltby, which the MP has described as ""completely false"". Mr Green then tweeted his reaction, describing the pornography claims as ""disreputable political smears"" and accusing Mr Quick of acting in ""flagrant breach"" of his duty of confidentiality. On Friday, retired Met detective Neil Lewis also alleged that""thousands"" of thumbnail images of legal pornography had been found on Mr Green's parliamentary computer. But he was condemned by the Met's Commissioner Cressida Dick, who said all officers had a duty to protect sensitive information they discovered. Responding the Mr Quick's comments on Tuesday, a spokesman for the Tory MP said: ""It would be inappropriate for Mr Green to comment while the Cabinet Office inquiry is ongoing and while the Metropolitan Police is investigating the conduct of former officers.""

'I pleaded with him to come back',"Jane Lyndon says she did not know her son was in Syria The mother of a British man who was killed in Syria has spoken of her ""hero"" son, who she tried to persuade to come home. Oliver Hall, 24 volunteered to fight with the YPG, the Kurdish-led armed group which has been battling against so-called Islamic State. Mr Hall was killed during an operation to clear mines from Raqqa in November. Jane Lyndon said ""he was a fun loving, cheeky, mischievous boy, who grew up to be a courageous and handsome man."" Mr Hall went to Bay House School, in Gosport, Hampshire, and after leaving school attended Fareham College, where he trained to be a telecommunications engineer. Ms Lyndon said her son went on to work for his stepfather ""whilst still trying to find his vocation in life"". British volunteer fighter Oliver Hall dies in Syria She had no idea he was planning to travel to Syria. ""The first I knew about it was when I received a message from him saying he was abroad doing charity work. ""Ollie asked me not to be disappointed or angry with him and, in his own words, said: 'I am away for a couple of months doing voluntary work, this is something I have to do. I have never known what to do with my life but after a lot of time thinking and planning I have decided to come and do some charity work'."" This message was sent in August. A couple of weeks later Ms Lyndon found out he was in northern Syria. ""This was the most devastating news I could ever receive,"" she said. Jane Lyndon says her son was trying to find his vocation in life It is estimated that hundreds of Westerners have travelled to Syria during the conflict to volunteer as fighters with the US-backed YPG, which has been fighting to recapture territory held by IS. Dozens of British volunteer fighters have been amongst them. Ms Lyndon said she, friends and family pleaded with her son to come home but he refused. ""He stated he was an adult and he had finally found his purpose in life and was making an impact on the world,"" she said. ""I would never want another family to go through this but at the same time Ollie is my hero, I am so proud of my son and miss him greatly."" ""Please could I ask that my family and I are now left in peace to grieve for a wonderful son and brother."" Oliver Hall had travelled to Syria in August to fight against so-called Islamic State Mr Hall's body will be repatriated to the UK, and the YPG has offered its support to his family. A spokesman said he ""will always be remembered by our people"". Mr Hall is the seventh British citizen to be killed with the YPG. There will be a ceremony for him at the Smelka Border crossing in Syria, before his body is taken over the border into Iraq to begin the journey home. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office continues to warn against all travel to Syria.

Stepfather admits water park death role,"Charlie Dunn's stepfather Paul Smith had denied any wrong-doing in relation to his death The stepfather of a five-year-old boy who drowned in a pool at a water park has pleaded guilty to manslaughter by gross negligence. Charlie Dunn, who could not swim, was pulled from the water at Bosworth Water Park in Leicestershire on 23 July 2016. Paul Smith, 36, had denied letting the boy wander off alone for more than two hours but changed his plea during the trial at Birmingham Crown Court. Charlie's mother, Lynsey Dunn, 28, has had the same charge dropped. Updates on this story and more from the East Midlands Paul Smith and Lynsey Dunn will be sentenced later this month She did admit a charge of neglect in connection with Charlie after an incident between July 2014 and July 2016, in which she failed to supervise him near a busy road. Dunn also pleaded guilty to a second charge of neglect in relation to another youngster, who cannot be named, after an incident in the summer of 2015. It can also now be reported that prior to the trial Smith admitted witness intimidation in connection with another incident relating to Charlie. Both defendants, of Glascote Heath, Tamworth, Staffordshire, will be sentenced on 20 December. Charlie was found in the Blue Lagoon children's pool at the park Charlie was found submerged in a 1.4m-deep lagoon at the busy attraction, in Market Bosworth, and pulled from the water by other children. A paramedic carried out CPR, before he was taken to hospital where he was pronounced dead. The court had previously heard he had been allowed to play unsupervised in the park. Opening the Crown's case on 30 November, prosecutor Mary Prior QC said: ""This case is not about parents turning their back for a minute whilst a tragedy occurs. ""We don't prosecute parents for unavoidable tragedies nor do we expect perfection in parenting. ""This is a gross failure to supervise not for seconds, and not for a few minutes, but for protracted periods of time in circumstances where the child was exposed to danger."" The trial was told Smith was overheard shouting he did not know where Charlie was on the day he died Acting Det Insp Nikki McLatchie, of Leicestershire Police, who worked on the case, said there were about a thousand people at the park on the day Charlie drowned. ""Witness testimony showed that Charlie was left alone on numerous occasions, despite him not being able to swim,"" she said. ""Smith was looking after Charlie at the park, and his failure as a parent came with the most tragic consequences and ultimately led to his death.""

'I beat diabetes with 200-calorie drinks',"Isobel Murray no longer thinks of herself as diabetic Nearly half of patients have reversed type 2 diabetes in a ""watershed"" trial, say doctors in Newcastle and Glasgow. People spent up to five months on a low-calorie diet of soups and shakes to trigger massive weight loss. Isobel Murray, 65, who had weighed 15 stone, lost over four stone (25kg) and no longer needs diabetes pills. She says: ""I've got my life back."" The charity Diabetes UK says the trial is a landmark and has the potential to help millions of patients. Isobel, from Largs in North Ayrshire, was one of 298 people on the trial. Her blood sugar levels were too high, and every time she went to the doctors they increased her medication. So, she went on to the all-liquid diet for 17 weeks - giving up cooking and shopping. She even ate apart from her husband, Jim. Instead, she had four liquid meals a day. It is hardly Masterchef - a sachet of powder is stirred in water to make a soup or shake. They contain about 200 calories, but also the right balance of nutrients. Isobel told the BBC it was relatively easy as ""you don't have to think about what you eat"". Once the weight has been lost, dieticians then help patients introduce healthy, solid meals. ""Eating normal food is the hardest bit,"" says Isobel. The trial results, simultaneouslypublished in the Lancet medical journal,externaland presented at the International Diabetes Federation, showed: 46% of patients who started the trial were in remission a year later 86% who lost 15kg (2st 5lb) or more put their type 2 diabetes into remission Only 4% went into remission with the best treatments currently used Prof Roy Taylor, from Newcastle University, told the BBC: ""It's a real watershed moment. ""Before we started this line of work, doctors and specialists regarded type 2 as irreversible. ""But if we grasp the nettle and get people out of their dangerous state, they can get remission of diabetes."" However, doctors are not calling this a cure. If the weight goes back on, then the diabetes will return. ""I will never go there again,"" says Isobel. So far, she has kept the weight off for two years. Body fat building up around the pancreas causes stress to the beta cells in the organ that controls blood sugar levels. They stop producing enough of the hormone insulin, and that causes blood sugar levels to rise out of control. Dieting loses the fat, and then the pancreas works properly again. The trial looked at only patients diagnosed in the past six years. It is thought having type 2 diabetes for very long periods of time may cause irreversible damage. Prof Mike Lean, from Glasgow University, told the BBC: ""It's hugely exciting."" ""We now have clear evidence that weight loss of 10-15kg is enough to turn this disease around. One in 11 adults worldwide has diabetes, and most of them have type 2. Uncontrolled sugar levels cause damage throughout the body, leading to organ failure, blindness and limb amputations. Treating the disease costs the UK's NHS about Â£10bn a year. Dr Elizabeth Robertson, the director of research at Diabetes UK, said: ""[The trial has] the potential to transform the lives of millions of people. ""The trial is ongoing, so that we can understand the long-term effects of an approach like this."" Isobel said: ""I don't look at myself as a diabetic at all.

Rail fare rise biggest for five years,"Train fares in Britain will go up by an average of 3.4% from 2 January. The increase, the biggest since 2013, covers regulated fares, which includes season tickets, and unregulated fares, such as off-peak leisure tickets. The Rail Delivery Group admitted it was a ""significant"" rise, but said that more than 97% of fare income went back into improving and running the railway. A passenger group said the rise was ""a chill wind"" and the RMT union called it a ""kick in the teeth"" for travellers. The rise in regulated fares had already been capped at July's Retail Prices Index inflation rate of 3.6%. The fare increase is abovethe latest Consumer Prices Index inflation figure of 3%, which was a five-and-a-half year high. The average rise in Scotland is 3.2% - below the national average. A Scotrail spokesman told the BBC that 85% of their revenue comes from fares regulated by the Scottish government. He added: ""We are investing millions of pounds to build the best railway Scotland has ever had, and that's why we remain the best performing large operator in the UK."" Are you joining the 'Â£5k commuter club'? The chief executive of passenger watchdog Transport Focus, Anthony Smith, said: ""While substantial, welcome investment in new trains and improved track and signals is continuing, passengers are still seeing the basic promises made by the rail industry broken on too many days."" One in nine trains has arrived late at its destination in the past 12 months. The Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union general secretary Mick Cash said: ""These fare increases are another twist of the economic knife. ""The private train companies are laughing all the way to the bank."" A Department for Transport spokesperson said: ""The government carefully monitors how rail fares and average earnings change and keeps the way fare levels are calculated under review. ""We are investing in the biggest rail modernisation programme for over a century to improve services for passengers - providing faster and better trains with more seats."" Paul Plummer, Rail Delivery Group chief executive, toldthe BBC's Today programme:""We are very aware of the pressures on people and the state of the economy and are making sure everything we do is looking to improve and change and make the best use of that money."" Mr Plummer admitted it was ""a significant increase"" in fares - the highest since they rose by 3.9% in January 2013. Figures published by the Office of Rail and Road in October showed that Â£4.2bn was given to the rail industry in 2016-17 - a drop of nearly 13% on the previous year, taking inflation into account. The Rail Delivery Group said that private investment in rail reached a record Â£925m in 2016-17. You might think that popularity is a good thing, but it's causing the railways some problems. Here's some examples. Passenger numbers on routes into King's Cross have rocketed by 70% in the past 14 years. On Southern trains, passenger numbers coming into London have doubled in 12 years. That's got to be good for easing congestion and reducing vehicle pollution... but much of our rail network is still Victorian and it's buckling under the strain of all those extra people. There is a push to bring in new trains, stations and better lines, but it's difficult to upgrade things while keeping them open and it's seriously expensive. The money's got to come from somewhere and in recent years it's the fare payer that's been asked to pick up a bigger proportion of the tab. It means that, year in and year out, many people have seen their season ticket go up much more than their salary, if they've had a salary rise at all. Brighton to London - Â£4,332 - Â£148 increase Gloucester to Birmingham - Â£4,108 - Â£140 increase Woking to London - Â£3,248 - Â£112 increase Liverpool to Manchester - Â£3,152 - Â£108 increase Maidenhead to London - Â£3,092 - Â£104 increase The rise has been met with anger by readers of the BBC News website. Tammy, who commutes into London from Milton Keynes, has seen her season ticket price rise from under Â£4,000 to nearly Â£6,000. She said: ""I think the price increase over the past eight years is disgusting,"" Dan said: ""This is a bit of a joke at this point. I can't see how people will be able to afford to get to and from London soon."" The quality of service also frustrates commuters. York-to-Manchester traveller Sunil Sahadev said: ""This is absolutely horrendous. Trains are almost always late and crammed. I feel really helpless and frustrated.."" Richard Cooper from East Sussex, said: ""As a 20+ year victim of Southeastern, I have seen little or no improvement in the quality or punctuality of services. We can only dream of a 9% lateness rate."" James Mercer, who travels in south London, said: ""Never a day goes by without a delay or more often than not a cancellation."" And Nick Moore, who stood on a journey from Coventry to Birmingham recently, said: ""If you booked a flight and you found out the flight was full, you would have to wait - not stand!""

"Thai speedboat deaths 'preventable'The husband of a woman who died when a speedboat capsized hopes ""appropriate lessons can be learned"".","Survivors were pulled from the sea after the boat capsized The deaths of two Britons in a Thai boat crash could ""have been prevented"", the husband of one has said. Monica O'Connor, 28, and Jason Parnell, 46, drowned afterthe speedboat capsized in monsoon conditions near the island of Koh Samui in May 2016. Delivering a narrative conclusion, coroner Alison Mutch said the captain's decision to ignore weather warnings contributed to their deaths. After the hearing, Tim O'Connor said his wife's death was ""tragic"". The couple, from Sale in Greater Manchester, had been on their honeymoon, while Mr Parnell, from Sileby in Leicestershire, was celebrating his first wedding anniversary. Thirty-two people were on board when the crash - in which a German and a Chinese national also died - occurred off the coast of Thailand. The inquest heardsmall boats were warned not to sailby Thailand's meteorological department. The hearing was also told the boat's passengers had been given no safety advice, there was no individual allocation of life jackets and a decision was made to sail the boat too close to the shore. Boat captain Sanan Sridakeow was jailed for a year, and operator Limited Partnership Angthong Discovery Tour was fined 15,000 Thai baht (Â£342) after admitting recklessness. Tim and Monica O'Connor were on honeymoon in Koh Samui when the boat capsized Recording a narrative conclusion, the senior coroner for South Manchester Alison Mutch said they ""died as a result of drowning, contributed to by the decision to operate the tour when a known weather warning was in force"". She added that she was ""truly sorry that what should have been memorable holidays in the most positive and happy ways ended in the ways they did"". Speaking after the hearing, Mr O'Connor said he hoped that ""appropriate lessons can be learned from today's findings to ensure no one else has to suffer the heartache and pain of losing a loved one"". He added that the inquest process had been ""incredibly difficult, particularly with the findings outlining just how Monica's death could and perhaps should have been prevented"".

Mass evacuation in California wildfire,"This video can not be played Los Angeles wildfires force thousands to evacuate Some 27,000 residents were forced to flee their homes in the middle of the night as a fast-moving wildfire ripped through southern California. Several thousand homes are under mandatory evacuation in the cities of Ventura and Santa Paula, some 70 miles (115 km) north of Los Angeles. Firefighters warned the fire was moving so fast they were unable to contain it. Fanned by high winds, the fire swept through tens of thousands of acres in a matter of hours. California Governor Jerry Brown has declared a state of emergency in Ventura County, promising to attack the fire ""with all we've got"". It was earlier reported that one person died in a traffic accident while trying to flee the blaze, but Ventura County Fire Capt Steve Kaufmann has since told the Associated Press that no body was found in an overturned car. Officials said one firefighter was injured. They also said 150 structures had been destroyed, and more than 260,000 people were without power. Hundreds of firefighters worked through the night to tackle the blaze, named the Thomas Fire, but fire chiefs admitted they were fighting a losing battle. ""The prospects for containment are not good. Really, Mother Nature is going to decide,"" Ventura County Fire Chief Mark Lorenzen earlier told reporters. More than 1,000 firefighters are now battling the fires, which have burned 45,500 acres.Authorities have warned of widespread smoke and advised people with health conditions, the elderly and children to stay indoors in affected areas.,external Forecasters say ferocious Santa Ana winds and low humidity will continue for a few days, making for extremely dangerous conditions.

""My son is a firefighter and I'm not going to wait around for someone to rescue me,"" June Byrum told CBS, saying her 91-year-old father, husband and dog had already left for a safe place. Santa Paula has 30,000 residents, while Ventura's population is about 110,000. Both are in Ventura County. Another fire broke out early on Tuesday local time closer to Los Angeles, in Sylmar. Homes have been damaged and more than 400 firefighters have been deployed there. The Ventura County fire is believed to have broken out close to Thomas Aquinas College in Santa Paula at some time after 18:00 local time on Monday (02:00 GMT). It was quickly fanned by gusts of up to 70mph (115 kph) that burned through dry brush. California has been hit hard by wildfires in recent months. At least 40 people were killed whenfires ripped through parts of northern California's wine region in October. Some 10,000 structures were destroyed.

Oliver confronts Hoffman over harassment,"Dustin Hoffman has said he has ""the utmost respect for women"" John Oliver has confronted Dustin Hoffman in a tense public discussion about allegations of sexual harassment that have been made against the actor. Hoffman defended himself after Anna Graham Hunter alleged he groped her on a film set when she was 17, in 1985. The actor questioned Ms Graham Hunter's claims, asking Oliver: ""Do you believe this stuff that you're reading?"" Hoffman said the HBO talk show host was not keeping an ""open mind"" and was unquestionably believing the accusers. ""I believe what she wrote, yes,"" Oliver replied. ""Because there's no point in her lying."" The actor countered: ""Well, there's a point in her not bringing it up for 40 years."" Oliver was hosting a panel discussion in New York to mark the 20th anniversary of Hoffman's film Wag The Dog. Oliver said he wasn't sure whether to broach the subject of the allegations but decided he'd end up ""hating myself"" if he didn't. The tetchy exchange was reported by The Washington Post,external, which also posted a video of part of the conversation. Dustin Hoffman accused of harassment Harassment in Hollywood: who's been accused? Ms Graham Hunter published her account of her encounters with Hoffman - including diary entries she said she had written at the time in which she accused him of being a ""dirty old man"" -in The Hollywood Reporter in November,external. The veteran star responded at the time by putting out a statement saying: ""I have the utmost respect for women and feel terrible that anything I might have done could have put her in an uncomfortable situation. ""I am sorry. It is not reflective of who I am."" Oliver picked him up on that line at Monday's public question-and-answer session - saying he wasn't satisfied with it because ""it is reflective of who you were"". Oliver hosts HBO's Last Week Tonight with John Oliver He went on: ""If it happened and you've given no evidence to show it didn't happen then there was a period of time for a while when you were a creeper around women. ""So it feels like a cop-out to say, 'It wasn't me.' Do you understand how that feels like a dismissal?"" Hoffman replied: ""It's difficult to answer that question. You weren't there."" Oliver retorted: ""I'm glad."" According to The Washington Post, Hoffman accused Oliver of making an ""incredible assumption about me"", adding sarcastically: ""You've made the case better than anyone else can. I'm guilty."" Ms Graham Hunter worked as an intern on Hoffman's 1985 TV movie Death of A Salesman. ""I still don't know who this woman is,"" Hoffman said on Monday. ""I never met her. If I met her it was in concert with other people."" The paper's video also showed Hoffman explaining that it was normal to talk about subjects like sex within the close-knit confines of the film crew, who he said were like ""a family"". He said: ""I said a stupid thing but I said it in the midst of the crew, and they said their stupid things. But they were sexual in terms of the humour of it. But that's 40 years ago."" Hoffman described touching his The Graduate co-star Katharine Ross on the bottom as ""nothing"" Hoffman also told a story about touching his The Graduate co-star Katharine Ross on the bottom during rehearsals - an act he played down, describing it as ""nothing"". She became angry, Hoffman explained but described that as ""an overreaction"", saying that she later apologised. The discussion comes as Hollywood grapples with how to clean up its act amid allegations against a string of stars and executives, and was a rare example of one of those men being challenged in public.

Turkey warns of 'red line' on Jerusalem,"No country has recognised Israeli sovereignty over Jerusalem Turkey's president has warned it could sever ties with Israel if the US recognises Jerusalem as its capital. Recep Tayyip Erdogan said such a move would cross a ""red line"" for Muslims. Donald Trump called Middle Eastern leaders on Tuesday amid growing warnings against taking the step. Reports say the president will dramatically shift the US position on the status of Jerusalem this week. Its fate is one of the thorniest issues between Israel and the Palestinians. Israel has always regarded it as its capital city, while the Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a future Palestinian state. If Washington recognises Jerusalem as Israel's capital, it would be the first country to do so since the foundation of the state in 1948. In a televised speech, Mr Erdogan addressed the US president directly, saying ""Mr Trump! Jerusalem is a red line for Muslims. ""We could go as far as cutting diplomatic ties with Israel over the issue,"" he added. The alternatives to a two-state solution Why settlement issue is so difficult Turkey and Israel restored diplomatic relations last year, six years after Turkey severed ties in protest at the killing of nine pro-Palestinian Turkish activists in clashes with Israeli commandos on board a ship trying to break Israel's naval blockade of Gaza. Israeli minister Naftali Bennett rebuffed the Turkish president, saying: ""Unfortunately, Erdogan does not miss an opportunity to attack Israel. ""There will always be those who criticise, but at the end of the day it is better to have a united Jerusalem than Erdogan's sympathy."" Mr Trump has been having conversations with numerous world leaders a day before his anticipated announcement. A Palestinian spokesman said President Mahmoud Abbas had told Mr Trump that moving the US embassy to Jerusalem would have dangerous consequences. He said Mr Abbas gave the warning after Mr Trump informed him of his intention to move the embassy. Jordan's King Abdullah has taken a similar line on the issue. He told Mr Trump that moving the embassy would have ""dangerous repercussions on the stability and security of the region"", a statement from the Jordanian palace said. Jordan acts as custodian of the Islamic sites in Jerusalem. The status of Jerusalem goes to the heart of Israel's conflict with the Palestinians, who are backed by the rest of the Arab and wider Islamic world. The city is home to key religious sites sacred to Judaism, Islam and Christianity, especially in East Jerusalem. Israel occupied the sector, previously occupied by Jordan, in the 1967 Middle East war and regards the entire city as its indivisible capital. The Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a future state, and according to 1993 Israel-Palestinian peace accords, its final status is meant to be discussed in the latter stages of peace talks. Israeli sovereignty over Jerusalem has never been recognised internationally, and all countries, including Israel's closest ally the US, maintain their embassies in Tel Aviv. Since 1967, Israel has built a dozen settlements, home to about 200,000 Jews, in East Jerusalem. These are considered illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this. If the US recognises Jerusalem as Israel's capital, it will put it out-of-step with the rest of the international community and reinforce Israel's position that settlements in the east are valid Israeli communities. France'sPresident Emmanuel Macron told Donald Trump he is ""concerned"" the US leader could unilaterally recognise Jerusalem as Israel's capital, saying any decision on its status must be ""within the framework of negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians"". TheEuropean Union, part of the so-called Middle East Quartet of mediators which includes the US, the UN and Russia, warned of ""serious repercussions on public opinion in large parts of the world"". Arab Leaguechief Ahmed Aboul Gheit warned it would be ""a dangerous measure that would have repercussions"". Saudi Arabiasaid such a move before a final settlement in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict would ""have a detrimental impact on the peace process"". Egypt'sPresident Abdel Fattah al-Sisi has also warned against the move. A statement said the leader had told Mr Trump not to complicate matters in the Middle East.

NI and England in reading top 10,"Almost 320,000 pupils took the tests, with girls ahead in almost every country Northern Ireland and England are in the top 10 of the world's best primary school readers in global rankings. The Progress in International Reading Literacy Study - known as PIRLS - shows Northern Ireland in joint sixth place, with England in joint eighth. Both Northern Ireland and England have reached their highest point scores in reading tests taken in 50 countries. Russia takes the top place in this international education league table, based on tests taken every five years. The Republic of Ireland, in fourth, is second only to Russia among European countries. Girls are ahead of boys in almost every country taking the tests. Geoff Barton, leader of the ASCL head teachers' union, praised the work of schools in England and Northern Ireland and said the results reflected ""the huge focus that schools have placed on the teaching of reading over the course of many years"". The tests taken by almost 320,000 10-year-olds around the world, showNorthern Ireland's pupils as among the highest achievers, ranked joint sixth with Poland. The result puts them only marginally behind long-standing high achievers such as Finland. This video can not be played ""I like reading because I get smarter and smarter"" - here's what the kids make of it all With the Northern Ireland assembly still suspended, there is no current education minister, but Northern Ireland's education department pointed to the success of a""Count, Read: Succeed"" strategy,externalintroduced in 2011 with targets to improve literacy and numeracy. There are no Sats tests for 11-year-olds in Northern Ireland, but pupils in the last year of primary can take transfer tests for grammar schools. It's also a system in which many places are allocated on the basis of religious faith. The National Foundation for Educational Research, which administered the tests in Northern Ireland, says families and local communities seemed to put a ""high value on academic success"". Senior research manager Juliet Sizmur said the international comparison suggested that reading was particularly valued in Northern Ireland. England was ranked joint eighth, alongside Norway and Taiwan, and England's school standards minister Nick Gibb hailed the positive impact of the phonics system of learning to read. ""Our rise through the global rankings is even more commendable because it has been driven by an increase in the number of low-performing pupils reading well,"" said Mr Gibb. This is a much higher ranking than in the international Pisa tests for secondary school pupils, run by the OECD, in which England is not in the top 20 for reading or maths. Scotland and Wales did not take part in these latest PIRLS tests. 1. Russia 2. Singapore 3. Hong Kong 4. Republic of Ireland 5. Finland 6. Poland = Northern Ireland 8. Norway = Taiwan = England Comparisons withthe last rankings from five years agodepend on which measures are used, says the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA), which runs the PIRLS tests with Boston College in the US. The Netherlands-based IEA says that this year England is 10th, but because ""there is no statistical significant difference"" with two countries above, they are effectively joint eighth. Five years ago, the IEA says England was ranked 11th, but as there was no statistical significant difference with US, Denmark, Croatia, Chinese Taipei, and Ireland this ""could be interpreted as a joint sixth ranking"". The IEA's executive director, Dirk Hastedt, says that Russia's success reflects a series of education reforms and a ""lot of emphasis on academic excellence"" and much more rigour over standards. Dr Hastedt says such tests reveal international trends in education. Girls are ahead of boys in almost every country taking the tests, says Dr Hastedt. He says there are increasing numbers of children in pre-school education - and this seems to be linked to higher performance. Pupils in Russia were the highest achieving in this global test There are also signs that parents are more likely to get involved in helping their children's learning. The national comparisons are based on representative samples of pupils, designed by researchers to reflect different regions and types of school. In England, there were about 5,000 pupils taking the tests last year, drawn from 170 schools. In Russia, the sample was based on about 4,600 pupils in 206 schools. Most of the pupils taking the tests were aged about 10 - but there were differences depending on the sample. In Russia and Finland, the average of those taking the tests was 10.8 years, a year older than the average age of those taking the test in Italy and France. Michael Martin, executive director of the TIMSS and PIRLS International Study Center at Boston College, says that this year's results showed the importance of early years education and parental interest. ""Children whose parents had engaged them in literacy activities - reading books or playing word games - from an early age are better equipped with basic reading skills when they begin primary schools and go on to have higher reading achievements,"" said Prof Martin.

Mueller 'seeks German bank data on Trump',"Robert Mueller is investigating alleged links between the Trump campaign and Russia US special counsel Robert Mueller has ordered Germany's Deutsche Bank to provide records of accounts held by Donald Trump, according to reports. Mr Mueller issued a subpoena to the bank several weeks ago demanding the transaction data, Reuters news agency and a German newspaper say. He is investigating alleged collusion between the Trump presidential campaign and Russia. However, a lawyer for the US president denied the reports. ""We have confirmed that the news reports that the special counsel had subpoenaed financial records relating to the president are false,"" attorney Jay Sekulow told Reuters in a statement. ""No subpoena has been issued or received. We have confirmed this with the bank and other sources."" US investigators are said to be demanding information on dealings linked to Mr Trump as part of an investigation into alleged Russian influence,externalin the US presidential election, according to Handelsblatt and Reuters. Deutsche Bank, one of the Trump Organization's major lenders on its real estate projects, said it would not comment on any of its individual clients. However in a statement to NBC News, it said: ""[Our bank] takes its legal obligations seriously and remains committed to co-operating with authorised investigations into this matter."" In June, Germany's largest bank rejected requests for account records by Democrats in the US House of Representatives to provide details of the president's finances, citing privacy laws. How Trump's Russia trouble unfolded What will Robert Mueller do? Mueller 'is ramrod straight in integrity' Russia: The 'cloud' over the Trump White House Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC News North America Reporter Until now, Robert Mueller has appeared to be operating on the periphery of President Trump - focusing on former campaign chairman Paul Manafort's previous foreign lobbying efforts, the Russian contacts of George Papadopoulos, a relatively minor foreign policy adviser, and the post-election actions of Mr Trump's confidant Michael Flynn. While the charges are serious, the president himself has been removed from the most heated prosecutorial action. That all changes if the Deutsche Bank reports are true. The German institution, which also has ties to Russian oligarchs, was a lifeline for the Trump Organization's businesses in the early 2000s, when US lenders turned their backs on the then-struggling business tycoon. How closely did Mr Trump and his associates follow the letter of the law at a time before he was a serious political candidate? The president's defenders will argue that his past business dealings are not relevant to the special counsel inquiry, tasked with probing possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 presidential election. A high-stakes showdown over whether Mr Mueller is exceeding his mandate could be brewing. As special counsel Mr Mueller, who headed the FBI for more than a decade, has the powers to subpoena records and bring criminal charges. He can also prosecute anyone who interferes in his investigation through crimes including perjury, obstruction of justice, destruction of evidence and intimidation of witnesses. Mr Mueller's office has so far spent about $3.2m (Â£2.4m) on attorneys, special agents and other expenses,externalas part of its investigation, the US Department of Justice revealed in a report on Tuesday. US intelligence agencies have concluded that Moscow tried to sway the presidential election in favour of Mr Trump. It is alleged that Russian hackers stole information linked to the campaign of his rival Hillary Clinton and passed it to Wikileaks so it could be released to undermine her. Mr Trump has repeatedly denied any collusion with Russia, calling the allegations a ""witch hunt"". Four people have so far been charged by Mr Mueller over alleged links between Moscow and the Trump team. October 2017:Mr Trump's former campaign chairmanPaul Manafortand his business associateRick Gatesare charged with 12 counts of money laundering, undisclosed foreign lobbying, and lying to government investigators over alleged links to pro-Russian groups in Ukraine (both deny the charges) October 2017:It emerges thatGeorge Papadopouloshas pleaded guilty to lying to FBI investigators about his contacts with Russian nationals and connected individuals while he was serving as a foreign policy advisor with the Trump campaign December 2017: Michael Flynn, the former general who was briefly Mr Trump's national security adviser, pleads guilty to making ""false, fictitious and fraudulent statements"" to the FBI about his contact with a Russian official.

Catalan leaders' arrest warrants dropped,"Campaigning for the vote officially began at midnight A Spanish judge has withdrawn European arrest warrants for ousted Catalan President Carles Puigdemont and four other ex-ministers. They fled to Belgium a month ago after declaring unilateral independence in a referendum ruled illegal by Spain. Despite the move, the judge said they still faced possible charges for sedition and rebellion. Rebellion is considered one of the most serious crimes in Spain, carrying a jail term of up to 30 years. Spanish Supreme Court judge Pablo Llareno announced the warrant's withdrawal on Tuesday morning, citing the willingness the Catalan leaders had shown to return ahead of fresh regional elections being held on 21 December. He said the European-wide warrant would complicate the Spanish legal probe, and its removal allows Spain to gain full control over the investigation. Catalonia's quarrel with Spain Catalan politicians struggle with Spanish prison regime Would Catalonia be a viable country? The ministers turned themselves into Belgian authorities after the warrant was issuedlast month, but were freed after being questioned. A Belgian judge was previously expected to rule whether to extradite the ministers on 14 December. The five were fighting the move, saying they may not receive a fair trial on their return. Mr Puigdemont has previously said he would return if this was guaranteed. On Mondaysix Catalan ex-ministers being held in a prison near Madrid were released from prison on bail.

Police warn of child live streaming risks,"This video can not be played 'He switched his webcam on and started groaning' Sex offenders are increasingly using live online streaming platforms to exploit children, police have warned. Children need to be educated on the risks associated with streaming sites, the National Crime Agency said. It said offenders were learning how young people communicated online and ""using this knowledge to abuse them"". In one week, authorities identified 345 vulnerable children and arrested 192 people, 30% involving streaming, blackmail and grooming. Social media channels such as YouTube, Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat all allow some form of live capability, while there are also many pure live streaming services, including Periscope, Omegle, Liveme and Lively. Police say abusers thrive on the immediacy these live platforms offer - targeting children with tricks, dares and threats to manipulate them into nudity or sexual acts. They called for help from parents and internet companies to help manage theevolving threat children face online. This video can not be played Child Sexual Exploitation lead explains why parents need to be more intrusive online. National Police Chiefs' Council Lead for Child Protection Chief Constable Simon Bailey said: ""We need parents and carers to talk to their children about healthy relationships and staying safe online. ""We need internet companies to help us stop access to sexual abuse images and videos and prevent abuse happening on their platforms."" An NCA survey found that while 84% of the 927 people who responded said they were alert to the potential dangers their children faced online, more than 30% had not spoken to their children about online safety in the last month. Almost 58% were not sure if they had adequate online security. By Angus Crawford, BBC News correspondent For many parents the world of live streaming apps is a bewildering one. Every month new ones emerge, to become the latest ""must do"". At their most basic they allow young people to broadcast live to the world from anywhere - classroom, playground or bedroom. Some only let a limited number of people see the broadcaster, others are open to anyone using the app - and that includes predators. It's easy to see why children like the apps. It's immediate, it seems like fun and many idolise the vloggers and Youtubers doing the same thing. The more viewers or ""likes"" the greater the affirmation for the child. And for tech companies? Video engages people for longer than anything else online and advertisers love that. The more video a platform can boast, the more advertisers it can attract. The growth of live streaming apps poses a stark question for the tech industry, one underlined by the NCA campaign - when you create an app that allows children to broadcast live to the world and allows the world to talk back - is it really possible to keep them safe? Read more about Angusâs investigation here. In a bid to raise awareness among children, a short animation - featuring a fictional abuser called Sam - is being launched by the NCA's Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre (Ceop). Released alongside the hashtag #WhoIsSam, the clip will show children and young people how offenders attempt to build exploitative virtual relationships. Zoe Hilton, from the NCA, said: ""Offenders will take advantage of the fact that young peoples' inhibitions are lower online so we're also encouraging parents to talk to their children about what a healthy relationship looks like and how to spot when someone might not be who they say they are. ""As well as ensuring that privacy settings are in place on the sites and apps they use, it's so important that we have regular and open conversations with our children about being safe online and encouraging them to speak up if something is worrying them or doesn't feel right."" Updated guidelines have been added to Ceop'sThinkuknow website,external, providing parents and guardians, and children of all ages with the latest advice on keeping safe online. Further guidelines have been issued ina report called Digital Childhood,externalwhich looks at concerns and makes recommendations for specific age groups. For example, it says parents should supervise their under-fives at all times online and suggests greater efforts should be made to stop 10 to 12-year-olds signing up to social media sites that are for those aged 13 and older. UK police forces have also increased offline intervention activity, working with schools, universities and after school clubs to increase awareness.

Facebook: Now for young children too,"Children can do video chats with friends and approved adults How young is too young to be on social media? Strictly speaking, only those aged 13 and over are allowed to use Facebook. But the prevention methods are trivial, meaning more than 20 million under-13-year-olds are thought to be using the network. So on Monday,Facebook launched its first app tailored for young users,external. It's a ringfenced network that needs parental approval before use, and will not - the company has promised - be used to feed data for advertising. Messenger Kids is a simplified, locked-down version of the messaging app Facebook today offers those over 13. ""Parents are increasingly allowing their children to use tablets and smartphones, but often have questions and concerns about how their kids use them and which apps are appropriate,"" said Loren Cheng, product manager for Messenger Kids. ""So when we heard about the need for better apps directly from parents during research and conversations with parents, we knew we needed to develop it alongside the people who were going to use it, as well as experts who could help guide our thinking."" If two children want to be friends on Messenger Kids, that friendship has to be approved by a parent for each child. Once confirmed to be safe, friends can do live video chat and send pictures and text to each other. Parental controls are designed to ensure communications are safe and approved There will also be ""a library of kid-appropriate and specially chosen GIFs, frames, stickers, masks and drawing tools lets them decorate content and express their personalities"". Police warn of child live streaming risks Under-age social media use 'on the rise' Google pledges 10,000 staff to tackle extremism Approved adults can also contact children through the app - although they will get their messages through the normal Facebook Messenger app. Messenger Kids will of course collect data: the child's name, the content of the messages, and typical usage reports for how the app is used. Facebook will share that information with third parties, which must have data protection policies that comply with Coppa, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act in the US. Facebook has promised the data will not be used in any way to power the ""grown up"" Facebook. Facebook has added an array of effects to make the video chat more enjoyable for children That's important - the obvious commercial benefit to this new app might be to target ads to parents based on what their kids are talking about. Or use what was discussed in Messenger Kids to target ads at teens as they graduate into over-13 Facebook. Neither of those things would happen, Facebook said. The app doesn't know specifically how old the children signing up are, so users will not be prompted to move onto Facebook when they are old enough. If a child does decide to join full Facebook, it will be a brand new account with no data carried over from what was said on Messenger Kids. Having youngsters graduate onto Facebook proper is of key strategic importance for the company as it seeks to make sure it is the social network of choice for the next generation of users. If it can capture the attention of 6 to 12-year-olds before Snapchat (or some other competitor) can, then chances are those same kids will naturally progress into using Facebook as teenagers and young adults. It is this demographic causing them the most headaches right now. But business sense aside, you have to ask: should children that young be using social media at all? Sean Parker, one of Facebook's early investors and its first president,recently opined on the negative impact of the service he helped create. âGod only knows what itâs doing to our childrenâs brains,"" he said, reflecting on the small ""dopamine hit"" we get when someone gives us a ""like"" on social media. The ""like"" mechanism is a key part of Messenger Kids - and as a society we might wonder if we want to introduce children as young as six to the concept of online peer validation. Six-year-olds should be playing with worms,not getting FOMO,external. Others want broader transparency on the various privacy issues that arise from the launch of this app. Facebook's blogpost on Monday was carefully crafted to alleviate various anticipated worries, and name-dropping experts and agencies that deal with protection of children is a key part of its marketing strategy here. There is tentative support for what Facebook is doing. The prevailing mood is that since kids are using social networks, you might as do what you can to make sure that use is safe and monitored. Common Sense Media, a US non-profit ""dedicated to improving the lives of kids and families"", has looked extensively at the proliferation of social media use among young children. âA messenger app for kids under 13 that only parents can sign them up for sounds like a nice idea on its face,"" said James Steyer, the organisation's chief executive. ""But without clear policies about data collection, what happens to the content children post, and plans for the future, it is impossible to fully trust the platform. ""We appreciate that for now, the product is ad-free and appears designed to put parents in control. But why should parents simply trust that Facebook is acting in the best interest of kids?"" Facebook knows this move into looking after far more vulnerable users will be watched extremely closely. Any harmful content that makes its way onto Messenger Kids will be a major issue for the firm. As YouTube found out whendisturbing videos found their way onto YouTube Kids,external, trying to make a child-safe space is difficult - a minority of people will always be looking at ways to get around protections. The app is only available in the US on Apple's iOS operating system initially.

'I beat diabetes with 200 calorie drinks',"Isobel Murray no longer thinks of herself as diabetic Nearly half of patients have reversed type 2 diabetes in a ""watershed"" trial, say doctors in Newcastle and Glasgow. People spent up to five months on a low-calorie diet of soups and shakes to trigger massive weight loss. Isobel Murray, 65, who had weighed 15 stone, lost over four stone (25kg) and no longer needs diabetes pills. She says: ""I've got my life back."" The charity Diabetes UK says the trial is a landmark and has the potential to help millions of patients. Isobel, from Largs in North Ayrshire, was one of 298 people on the trial. Her blood sugar levels were too high, and every time she went to the doctors they increased her medication. So, she went on to the all-liquid diet for 17 weeks - giving up cooking and shopping. She even ate apart from her husband, Jim. Instead, she had four liquid meals a day. It is hardly Masterchef - a sachet of powder is stirred in water to make a soup or shake. They contain about 200 calories, but also the right balance of nutrients. Isobel told the BBC it was relatively easy as ""you don't have to think about what you eat"". Once the weight has been lost, dieticians then help patients introduce healthy, solid meals. ""Eating normal food is the hardest bit,"" says Isobel. The trial results, simultaneouslypublished in the Lancet medical journal,externaland presented at the International Diabetes Federation, showed: 46% of patients who started the trial were in remission a year later 86% who lost 15kg (2st 5lb) or more put their type 2 diabetes into remission Only 4% went into remission with the best treatments currently used Prof Roy Taylor, from Newcastle University, told the BBC: ""It's a real watershed moment. ""Before we started this line of work, doctors and specialists regarded type 2 as irreversible. ""But if we grasp the nettle and get people out of their dangerous state, they can get remission of diabetes."" However, doctors are not calling this a cure. If the weight goes back on, then the diabetes will return. ""I will never go there again,"" says Isobel. So far, she has kept the weight off for two years. Body fat building up around the pancreas causes stress to the beta cells in the organ that controls blood sugar levels. They stop producing enough of the hormone insulin, and that causes blood sugar levels to rise out of control. Dieting loses the fat, and then the pancreas works properly again. The trial looked at only patients diagnosed in the past six years. It is thought having type 2 diabetes for very long periods of time may cause irreversible damage. Prof Mike Lean, from Glasgow University, told the BBC: ""It's hugely exciting."" ""We now have clear evidence that weight loss of 10-15kg is enough to turn this disease around. One in 11 adults worldwide has diabetes, and most of them have type 2. Uncontrolled sugar levels cause damage throughout the body, leading to organ failure, blindness and limb amputations. Treating the disease costs the UK's NHS about Â£10bn a year. Dr Elizabeth Robertson, the director of research at Diabetes UK, said: ""[The trial has] the potential to transform the lives of millions of people. ""The trial is ongoing, so that we can understand the long-term effects of an approach like this."" Isobel said: ""I don't look at myself as a diabetic at all.

Mass evacuation in California wildfireThe fast-moving fire is bearing down on the cities of Ventura and Santa Paula.1h32 minutes agoUS & Canada,"This video can not be played Los Angeles wildfires force thousands to evacuate Some 27,000 residents were forced to flee their homes in the middle of the night as a fast-moving wildfire ripped through southern California. Several thousand homes are under mandatory evacuation in the cities of Ventura and Santa Paula, some 70 miles (115 km) north of Los Angeles. Firefighters warned the fire was moving so fast they were unable to contain it. Fanned by high winds, the fire swept through tens of thousands of acres in a matter of hours. California Governor Jerry Brown has declared a state of emergency in Ventura County, promising to attack the fire ""with all we've got"". It was earlier reported that one person died in a traffic accident while trying to flee the blaze, but Ventura County Fire Capt Steve Kaufmann has since told the Associated Press that no body was found in an overturned car. Officials said one firefighter was injured. They also said 150 structures had been destroyed, and more than 260,000 people were without power. Hundreds of firefighters worked through the night to tackle the blaze, named the Thomas Fire, but fire chiefs admitted they were fighting a losing battle. ""The prospects for containment are not good. Really, Mother Nature is going to decide,"" Ventura County Fire Chief Mark Lorenzen earlier told reporters. More than 1,000 firefighters are now battling the fires, which have burned 45,500 acres.Authorities have warned of widespread smoke and advised people with health conditions, the elderly and children to stay indoors in affected areas.,external Forecasters say ferocious Santa Ana winds and low humidity will continue for a few days, making for extremely dangerous conditions.

Santa Paula has 30,000 residents, while Ventura's population is about 110,000. Both are in Ventura County. Another fire broke out early on Tuesday local time closer to Los Angeles, in Sylmar. Homes have been damaged and more than 400 firefighters have been deployed there. The Ventura County fire is believed to have broken out close to Thomas Aquinas College in Santa Paula at some time after 18:00 local time on Monday (02:00 GMT). It was quickly fanned by gusts of up to 70mph (115 kph) that burned through dry brush. California has been hit hard by wildfires in recent months.

Catalan leaders' arrest warrants droppedThe Supreme Court says Carles Puigdemont and others have shown a willingness to return to Spain.,"Campaigning for the vote officially began at midnight A Spanish judge has withdrawn European arrest warrants for ousted Catalan President Carles Puigdemont and four other ex-ministers. They fled to Belgium a month ago after declaring unilateral independence in a referendum ruled illegal by Spain. Despite the move, the judge said they still faced possible charges for sedition and rebellion. Rebellion is considered one of the most serious crimes in Spain, carrying a jail term of up to 30 years. Spanish Supreme Court judge Pablo Llareno announced the warrant's withdrawal on Tuesday morning, citing the willingness the Catalan leaders had shown to return ahead of fresh regional elections being held on 21 December. He said the European-wide warrant would complicate the Spanish legal probe, and its removal allows Spain to gain full control over the investigation. Catalonia's quarrel with Spain Catalan politicians struggle with Spanish prison regime Would Catalonia be a viable country? The ministers turned themselves into Belgian authorities after the warrant was issuedlast month, but were freed after being questioned. A Belgian judge was previously expected to rule whether to extradite the ministers on 14 December. The five were fighting the move, saying they may not receive a fair trial on their return. Mr Puigdemont has previously said he would return if this was guaranteed. On Mondaysix Catalan ex-ministers being held in a prison near Madrid were released from prison on bail. But two others, including former Catalan Vice President Orial Junqueras, were remanded in custody. Campaigning has now officially started ahead of the new vote organised by Spanish authorities in an attempt to try and resolve the Catalonia crisis. This video can not be played Why the colour yellow has become contentious in Catalonia Mr Puigdemont labelled the election as a choice between ""nation or submission"" while speaking on a video link from Belgium to a rally in Barcelona on Monday night.

A seat reserved for the former leader at the event was marked with a yellow ribbon, an emblem that has become a symbol of support for the jailed politicians. All but one of the 13 Catalan leaders sacked by the Spanish government after the independence referendum are standing for election again in the fresh vote. A new opinion poll, conducted by the Spanish Centre for Sociological Research (CIS) in late November, suggests that pro-independence parties will fall narrowly short of an absolute majority in the December election. Mr Puidgemont and Mr Junqueras' pro-separatist parties are campaigning separately in the new vote, after a divide emerged over the future of the region following the nulled referendum.

Crime checks slammed after hammer attack,"Pamela Batten suffered a fractured skull in the attack by her husband's former carer The son of a 90-year-old woman who was stabbed in the neck by a carer with a previous assault conviction is calling for a change to criminal record checks. Abosede Adeyinka hit Pamela Batten on the head with a hammer and stabbed her at her home in Hillingdon, west London. Adeyinka wasjailed for 21 years in Novemberfor attempted murder. But Mrs Batten's son Sammy said the carer should never have been given a job because of her previous convictions. Adeyinka, who had built a relationship with the victim after she cared for Mrs Batten's husband, let herself into the house in April before pushing the elderly grandmother to the floor. The 52-year-old pulled a hammer from her handbag and fractured Mrs Batten's skull, then plunged a knife into her victim's neck, narrowly missing her spinal cord. Mrs Batten has recovered well from most of her injuries, but her son said she is now very nervous and has lost the ""happy-go-lucky"" side of her personality. Sammy Batten said Adeyinka should never have been allowed to work with vulnerable people But Mr Batten is ""angry"" and ""astonished"" Adeyinka was allowed to look after vulnerable people when her employers knew about her previous convictions for fraud and shoplifting. It was revealed during the trial Adeyinka also had convictions for actual bodily harm and burglary. Mr Batten said: ""Everyone's got to have a job, but you can't put a fox in charge of the hen house. ""What's the point of vetting someone if you then ignore the results?"" A spokesman for Adeyinka's employer Avant Healthcare said the firm undertook a ""robust"" interviewing process, including thorough referencing and criminal checks. Avant said it was not aware of the actual bodily harm conviction. The spokesman added: ""If Avant Healthcare had been aware of an assault conviction, Abosede Adeyinka would not have been employed."" Abosede Adeyinka was jailed for 21 years, last month The Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) said anyone employing people to work with vulnerable adults or children should request an enhanced DBS check. It added convictions held by police will be revealed by the enhanced check, but that this is ""subject to filtering arrangements"". The Home Office refused to comment.

Freddie Mercury film director fired,"Bryan Singer's past directing credits include The Usual Suspects and Superman Returns The director of the new Freddie Mercury biopic, Bohemian Rhapsody, has been fired due to ""unreliable behaviour"". In a statement, Twentieth Century Fox said Bryan Singer was no longer the director of the film. A source told the BBC the main reason for the firing was ""a pattern of unreliable behaviour on the set"". But Singer said his firing came while he was ill and that the studio was ""unwilling to accommodate"" him during his illness. The Hollywood Reporter reported on Mondaythat Singer had clashed with lead actor Rami Malek,externaland failed to show up for filming on multiple occasions. The studio had earlier said production had been suspended so Singer could deal with ""a personal health matter"". The troubled history of the Queen biopic Director fired from Freddie Mercury film First look at Rami Malik as Freddie Mercury In a statement issued through his lawyer to the BBC, Singer - the director of The Usual Suspects, four X-Men movies and Superman Returns - said he was disappointed not to be able to finish the film, ""a passion project of mine"". Rami Malek has so far made no public comments on the latest developments ""With fewer than three weeks to shoot remaining, I asked Fox for some time off so I could return to the US to deal with pressing health matters concerning one of my parents,"" he said. ""This was a very taxing experience, which ultimately took a serious toll on my own health.  Unfortunately, the studio was unwilling to accommodate me and terminated my services.  This was not my decision and it was beyond my control."" He added that rumours of clashes with Malek, the star of the Mr Robot TV series, were not true. ""While, at times, we did have creative differences on set, Rami and I successfully put those differences behind us and continued to work on the film together until just prior to Thanksgiving,"" he said. Filming has been taking place in the UK, with Ben Hardy, Joe Mazzello and Gwilym Lee starring as Queen's other members. The movie is still expected to be released in December 2018 as planned. As well as directing, Singer is listed as a co-producer, alongside Queen's Brian May and Roger Taylor, among others.

Devenport: Difficult days,"Unionists are sceptical Irish border trade harmonisation may be the thin end of an Irish unity wedge Last Friday, European Council President Donald Tusk visited Dublin and told British politicians that, whether they liked it or not, the key to the UK's future after Brexit lay in Dublin. This week began with the DUP leader, Arlene Foster, reminding the EU, Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Theresa May that, whether they like it or not, her party holds some cards in the Brexit game. The DUP says it never assented to any of the wording which leaked out of the Brexit discussions,whether it be ""no regulatory divergence"" across the island of Ireland after Brexit or ""continued regulatory alignment"". May fights to save deal after DUP backlash Those words were meant to provide reassurance to the Irish government that, should the EU and the UK not be able to reach a trade deal, there would be a backstop that would guarantee trade across the border would continue pretty much as it does now. It would mean Northern Ireland businesses adhering to the same standards and rules as their southern counterparts. However, unionists tend to view with scepticism any proposal for harmonisation of rules on either side of the border. They are concerned such an approach may be the thin end of a wedge towards Irish unity. In addition, the committed Brexiteers among the DUP argue that if, over time, Northern Ireland diverges from the trading regulations applied elsewhere in the UK, it could create a barrier to trade within the UK and prevent Belfast benefiting from any deals London might negotiate in the future. Perhaps if the parliamentary arithmetic had been different, the prime minister might have pushed ahead and signed a deal with the EU against the DUP's wishes. But Theresa May needs the DUP's backing at Westminster. If she had ignored their concerns, there's little doubt that the party's 10 MPs would have sat on their hands and not supported the Conservatives in important votes on the EU Withdrawal Bill this week. Government negotiators have 10 days until the full European summit to try to placate the DUP and make progress towards the Holy Grail of phase two trade talks. But that task has been complicated by the DUP's show of strength, the publication of the sensitive wording from the draft negotiating text and Leo Varadkar's public insistence that the British government had signed up to a formula which the DUP found so hard to swallow. A deadline has been missed and difficult negotiations lie ahead. In other words, we are back in a scenario with which the DUP, with all of its Stormont experience, is very familiar.

"Ocean plastic a 'planetary crisis' - UNLife in the seas risks irreparable damage if we don't act now, the UN's head of oceans says.12h12 hours agoScience & EnvironmentComments","Plastic waste has a variety of detrimental effects on the environment Life in the seas risks irreparable damage from a rising tide of plastic waste, the UN oceans chief has warned. Lisa Svensson said governments, firms and individual people must act far more quickly to halt plastic pollution. ""This is a planetary crisis,"" she said. ""In a few short decades since we discovered the convenience of plastics, we are ruining the ecosystem of the ocean."" She was speaking to BBC News ahead of a UN environment summit in Nairobi. Delegates at the meeting want tougher action against plastic litter. 'Shame and anger' at plastic pollution Plastic 'threat' to Scottish wildlife Chemical clue to why birds eat plastic Ms Svensson had just been saddened by a Kenyan turtle hospital which treats animals that have ingested waste plastic. She saw a juvenile turtle named Kai, brought in by fishermen a month ago because she was floating on the sea surface. Plastic waste was immediately suspected, because if turtles have eaten too much plastic it bloats their bellies and they can't control their buoyancy. Kai was given laxatives for two weeks to clear out her system, and Ms Svensson witnessed an emotional moment as Kai was carried back to the sea to complete her recovery. ""It's a very happy moment,"" she said. ""But sadly we can't be sure that Kai won't be back again if she eats more plastic. ""It's heart-breaking, but it's reality. We just have to do much more to make sure the plastics don't get into the sea in the first place."" Caspar van de Geer runs the turtle hospital for the group Local Ocean Conservation at Watamu in eastern Kenya. He had demonstrated earlier how uncannily a plastic film pulsating in the water column mimics the actions of the jellyfish some turtles love to eat. ""Turtles aren't stupid,"" he said. ""It's really difficult to tell the difference between plastics and jellyfish, and it may be impossible for a turtle to learn."" On a pin board he's compiled a grid of sealed clear plastic bags like the ones used at airports for cosmetics. Here they contain the plastic fragments removed from the stomachs of sick turtles. Half of the turtles brought here after eating plastics have died. A huge table at the hospital is laden with an array of plastic waste collected off local beaches - from fishing nets and nylon ropes to unidentifiable fragments of plastic film. Many seabirds, such as this albatross, accidentally eat plastic There's waste from down the coast as far as Tanzania - but also from Madagascar, the Comoros Islands, Thailand, Indonesia and even a bottle from far-away Japan. There's a score of mysterious white plastic rings which staff speculate are the rims of yoghurt pots, a plastic lighter. There are disintegrating woven plastic fertiliser bags, plastic straws - and much more. Bite marks show some items like small suncream bottles have clearly been nibbled at by fish, because they look like potential food. Local people scour the beach daily for plastic waste. They want clean beaches, and they're aware that local hotels want the same. But along the high water line millions of the fragments of plastics are mixed in with dried sea grass, too small to be collected. ""The scale of the challenge is absolutely enormous,"" says Ms Svensson. She's backing a resolution by Norway this week for the world to completely eliminate plastic waste into the ocean. If all nations agree to that long-term goal it'll be considered a UN success. Certainly, it sounds more ambitious than the current commitment to substantially decrease waste inputs into the sea by 2025. But some environmentalists argue that the absence of a timetable for preventing waste is a huge failing. Tisha Brown from Greenpeace told BBC News: ""We welcome that they are looking at a stronger statement, but with billions of tonnes of plastic waste entering the oceans we need much more urgent action. ""We need manufacturers to take responsibility for their products - and we need to look at our consumption patterns that are driving all this."" Indonesia - the world's second biggest plastics polluter after China - has pledged to reduce plastic waste into the ocean 75% by 2025, but some observers doubt legal rules are strong enough to make this happen. Plastic waste is also on the agenda for this month's China Council - an influential high level dialogue in which world experts advise China's leaders on environmental issues. Kenya itself has banned single-use plastic bags, along with Rwanda, Tanzania and - soon- Sri Lanka. Bangladesh has had controls for many years, especially to stop bags clogging up drains and causing floods. The crisis threatens a variety of marine animals, including turtles But bags are just one part of the problem - there are so many other types of plastic flowing through waterways. ""The UN process is slow,"" Ms Svensson admitted. ""It could take 10 years to get a UN treaty agreed on plastic litter and a further two years to get it implemented. ""We have to progress through the UN because this is a truly global problem - but we can't wait that long. ""We need to get much stronger actions from civil society, putting pressure on business to change - they can switch their supply chains very fast. And we need more individual governments to take urgent action too."" She praised the BBC's Blue Planet series and urged other parts of the media to highlight the issue. Ms Svensson said the ocean was facing multiple assault from over-fishing; pollution from chemicals, sewage and agriculture; development in coastal areas;  climate change; ocean acidification; and over-exploitation of coral reefs. ""This is a planetary emergency,"" she said. ""I sense there is a momentum now about the need to act. We just have to be much faster."" As we left Watamu after Kai's joyous release, I turned back for one last glance at the Indian Ocean. A small boy tossed a plastic bottle over his shoulder into the sparkling water.

Spain withdraws Puigdemont arrest warrant,"Campaigning for the vote officially began at midnight A Spanish judge has withdrawn European arrest warrants for ousted Catalan President Carles Puigdemont and four other ex-ministers. They fled to Belgium a month ago after declaring unilateral independence in a referendum ruled illegal by Spain. Despite the move, the judge said they still faced possible charges for sedition and rebellion. Rebellion is considered one of the most serious crimes in Spain, carrying a jail term of up to 30 years. Spanish Supreme Court judge Pablo Llareno announced the warrant's withdrawal on Tuesday morning, citing the willingness the Catalan leaders had shown to return ahead of fresh regional elections being held on 21 December. He said the European-wide warrant would complicate the Spanish legal probe, and its removal allows Spain to gain full control over the investigation. Catalonia's quarrel with Spain Catalan politicians struggle with Spanish prison regime Would Catalonia be a viable country? The ministers turned themselves into Belgian authorities after the warrant was issuedlast month, but were freed after being questioned. A Belgian judge was previously expected to rule whether to extradite the ministers on 14 December. The five were fighting the move, saying they may not receive a fair trial on their return. Mr Puigdemont has previously said he would return if this was guaranteed. On Mondaysix Catalan ex-ministers being held in a prison near Madrid were released from prison on bail. But two others, including former Catalan Vice President Orial Junqueras, were remanded in custody. Campaigning has now officially started ahead of the new vote organised by Spanish authorities in an attempt to try and resolve the Catalonia crisis. This video can not be played Why the colour yellow has become contentious in Catalonia Mr Puigdemont labelled the election as a choice between ""nation or submission"" while speaking on a video link from Belgium to a rally in Barcelona on Monday night. He said voters must chose ""between Catalan institutions or dark characters in Madrid"". A seat reserved for the former leader at the event was marked with a yellow ribbon, an emblem that has become a symbol of support for the jailed politicians. All but one of the 13 Catalan leaders sacked by the Spanish government after the independence referendum are standing for election again in the fresh vote. A new opinion poll, conducted by the Spanish Centre for Sociological Research (CIS) in late November, suggests that pro-independence parties will fall narrowly short of an absolute majority in the December election. Mr Puidgemont and Mr Junqueras' pro-separatist parties are campaigning separately in the new vote, after a divide emerged over the future of the region following the nulled referendum. The parties ran together in the 2015 election when separatist parties won an overall majority in the Catalan parliament when they won 72 seats.

"Supreme Court backs Trump travel banBut the directive covering Chad, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria and Yemen still faces legal challenges.9h9 hours agoUS & Canada","A woman wears a US flag headscarf as she participates in the #NoMuslimBanEver rally in Los Angeles in October The US Supreme Court has ruled President Donald Trump's travel ban on six mainly Muslim countries can go into full effect, pending legal challenges.

The ruling covers the third version of the directive that the president has issued since taking office. Seven of the nine justices lifted injunctions on Monday imposed by lower courts against the policy. Only liberal Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor would have allowed the president's order to remain blocked.

New warnings over US shift on Jerusalem,"No country has recognised Israeli sovereignty over Jerusalem Turkey's president has warned it could sever ties with Israel if the US recognises Jerusalem as its capital. Recep Tayyip Erdogan said such a move would cross a ""red line"" for Muslims. Donald Trump called Middle Eastern leaders on Tuesday amid growing warnings against taking the step. Reports say the president will dramatically shift the US position on the status of Jerusalem this week. Its fate is one of the thorniest issues between Israel and the Palestinians. Israel has always regarded it as its capital city, while the Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a future Palestinian state. If Washington recognises Jerusalem as Israel's capital, it would be the first country to do so since the foundation of the state in 1948. In a televised speech, Mr Erdogan addressed the US president directly, saying ""Mr Trump! Jerusalem is a red line for Muslims. ""We could go as far as cutting diplomatic ties with Israel over the issue,"" he added. The alternatives to a two-state solution Why settlement issue is so difficult Turkey and Israel restored diplomatic relations last year, six years after Turkey severed ties in protest at the killing of nine pro-Palestinian Turkish activists in clashes with Israeli commandos on board a ship trying to break Israel's naval blockade of Gaza. Israeli minister Naftali Bennett rebuffed the Turkish president, saying: ""Unfortunately, Erdogan does not miss an opportunity to attack Israel. ""There will always be those who criticise, but at the end of the day it is better to have a united Jerusalem than Erdogan's sympathy."" Mr Trump has been having conversations with numerous world leaders a day before his anticipated announcement. A Palestinian spokesman said President Mahmoud Abbas had told Mr Trump that moving the US embassy to Jerusalem would have dangerous consequences. He said Mr Abbas gave the warning after Mr Trump informed him of his intention to move the embassy. Jordan's King Abdullah has taken a similar line on the issue. He told Mr Trump that moving the embassy would have ""dangerous repercussions on the stability and security of the region"", a statement from the Jordanian palace said. Jordan acts as custodian of the Islamic sites in Jerusalem. The status of Jerusalem goes to the heart of Israel's conflict with the Palestinians, who are backed by the rest of the Arab and wider Islamic world. The city is home to key religious sites sacred to Judaism, Islam and Christianity, especially in East Jerusalem. Israel occupied the sector, previously occupied by Jordan, in the 1967 Middle East war and regards the entire city as its indivisible capital. The Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a future state, and according to 1993 Israel-Palestinian peace accords, its final status is meant to be discussed in the latter stages of peace talks. Israeli sovereignty over Jerusalem has never been recognised internationally, and all countries, including Israel's closest ally the US, maintain their embassies in Tel Aviv. Since 1967, Israel has built a dozen settlements, home to about 200,000 Jews, in East Jerusalem. These are considered illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this. If the US recognises Jerusalem as Israel's capital, it will put it out-of-step with the rest of the international community and reinforce Israel's position that settlements in the east are valid Israeli communities. France'sPresident Emmanuel Macron told Donald Trump he is ""concerned"" the US leader could unilaterally recognise Jerusalem as Israel's capital, saying any decision on its status must be ""within the framework of negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians"". TheEuropean Union, part of the so-called Middle East Quartet of mediators which includes the US, the UN and Russia, warned of ""serious repercussions on public opinion in large parts of the world"". Arab Leaguechief Ahmed Aboul Gheit warned it would be ""a dangerous measure that would have repercussions"". Saudi Arabiasaid such a move before a final settlement in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict would ""have a detrimental impact on the peace process"". Egypt'sPresident Abdel Fattah al-Sisi has also warned against the move. A statement said the leader had told Mr Trump not to complicate matters in the Middle East.

Ocean plastic a 'planetary crisis' - UN,"Plastic waste has a variety of detrimental effects on the environment Life in the seas risks irreparable damage from a rising tide of plastic waste, the UN oceans chief has warned. Lisa Svensson said governments, firms and individual people must act far more quickly to halt plastic pollution. ""This is a planetary crisis,"" she said. ""In a few short decades since we discovered the convenience of plastics, we are ruining the ecosystem of the ocean."" She was speaking to BBC News ahead of a UN environment summit in Nairobi. Delegates at the meeting want tougher action against plastic litter. 'Shame and anger' at plastic pollution Plastic 'threat' to Scottish wildlife Chemical clue to why birds eat plastic Ms Svensson had just been saddened by a Kenyan turtle hospital which treats animals that have ingested waste plastic. She saw a juvenile turtle named Kai, brought in by fishermen a month ago because she was floating on the sea surface. Plastic waste was immediately suspected, because if turtles have eaten too much plastic it bloats their bellies and they can't control their buoyancy. Kai was given laxatives for two weeks to clear out her system, and Ms Svensson witnessed an emotional moment as Kai was carried back to the sea to complete her recovery. ""It's a very happy moment,"" she said. ""But sadly we can't be sure that Kai won't be back again if she eats more plastic. ""It's heart-breaking, but it's reality. We just have to do much more to make sure the plastics don't get into the sea in the first place."" Caspar van de Geer runs the turtle hospital for the group Local Ocean Conservation at Watamu in eastern Kenya. He had demonstrated earlier how uncannily a plastic film pulsating in the water column mimics the actions of the jellyfish some turtles love to eat. ""Turtles aren't stupid,"" he said. ""It's really difficult to tell the difference between plastics and jellyfish, and it may be impossible for a turtle to learn."" On a pin board he's compiled a grid of sealed clear plastic bags like the ones used at airports for cosmetics. Here they contain the plastic fragments removed from the stomachs of sick turtles. Half of the turtles brought here after eating plastics have died. A huge table at the hospital is laden with an array of plastic waste collected off local beaches - from fishing nets and nylon ropes to unidentifiable fragments of plastic film. Many seabirds, such as this albatross, accidentally eat plastic There's waste from down the coast as far as Tanzania - but also from Madagascar, the Comoros Islands, Thailand, Indonesia and even a bottle from far-away Japan. There's a score of mysterious white plastic rings which staff speculate are the rims of yoghurt pots, a plastic lighter. There are disintegrating woven plastic fertiliser bags, plastic straws - and much more. Bite marks show some items like small suncream bottles have clearly been nibbled at by fish, because they look like potential food. Local people scour the beach daily for plastic waste. They want clean beaches, and they're aware that local hotels want the same. But along the high water line millions of the fragments of plastics are mixed in with dried sea grass, too small to be collected. ""The scale of the challenge is absolutely enormous,"" says Ms Svensson. She's backing a resolution by Norway this week for the world to completely eliminate plastic waste into the ocean. If all nations agree to that long-term goal it'll be considered a UN success. Certainly, it sounds more ambitious than the current commitment to substantially decrease waste inputs into the sea by 2025. But some environmentalists argue that the absence of a timetable for preventing waste is a huge failing. Tisha Brown from Greenpeace told BBC News: ""We welcome that they are looking at a stronger statement, but with billions of tonnes of plastic waste entering the oceans we need much more urgent action. ""We need manufacturers to take responsibility for their products - and we need to look at our consumption patterns that are driving all this."" Indonesia - the world's second biggest plastics polluter after China - has pledged to reduce plastic waste into the ocean 75% by 2025, but some observers doubt legal rules are strong enough to make this happen. Plastic waste is also on the agenda for this month's China Council - an influential high level dialogue in which world experts advise China's leaders on environmental issues. Kenya itself has banned single-use plastic bags, along with Rwanda, Tanzania and - soon- Sri Lanka. Bangladesh has had controls for many years, especially to stop bags clogging up drains and causing floods. The crisis threatens a variety of marine animals, including turtles But bags are just one part of the problem - there are so many other types of plastic flowing through waterways. ""The UN process is slow,"" Ms Svensson admitted. ""It could take 10 years to get a UN treaty agreed on plastic litter and a further two years to get it implemented. ""We have to progress through the UN because this is a truly global problem - but we can't wait that long. ""We need to get much stronger actions from civil society, putting pressure on business to change - they can switch their supply chains very fast. And we need more individual governments to take urgent action too."" She praised the BBC's Blue Planet series and urged other parts of the media to highlight the issue. Ms Svensson said the ocean was facing multiple assault from over-fishing; pollution from chemicals, sewage and agriculture; development in coastal areas;  climate change; ocean acidification; and over-exploitation of coral reefs. ""This is a planetary emergency,"" she said. ""I sense there is a momentum now about the need to act. We just have to be much faster."" As we left Watamu after Kai's joyous release, I turned back for one last glance at the Indian Ocean. A small boy tossed a plastic bottle over his shoulder into the sparkling water.

Kuenssberg: What happened?,"What just happened? Meetings in Brussels often run over. Maybe it's the witty repartee, or the chest-beating, or the fact that the institutions here are in the business of trying to get nearly 30 countries to agree on complicated issues. It is political rocket science. But when Theresa May's lunch with Jean-Claude Juncker went on, and on, and on, and on, a whiff of doubt started to do the rounds. UK and EU fail to strike a deal Through the morning, MEPs and senior politicians - including the president of the EU Council - were suggesting on the record that there had been enough compromises on the British side over the Irish border to enable the talks to move on. Downing Street did little to dampen down what was much more than the usual kind of summit speculation. There were well-known politicians in Brussels and in Ireland saying publicly they were confident and that there had been enough progress to move forwards. But it seemed they hadn't reckoned on the determination of the DUP. They have been kept in close contact with the government over what was being discussed. But after this morning's reports circulated they snapped. The leader, Arlene Foster, called a press conference to reiterate her often stated position that in her view, Northern Ireland must not be allowed to be any different to the rest of the Britain as a result of Brexit. It is, of course, possible that the DUP feels the political need to be publicly cross as much as possible, before an eventual compromise. Some familiar with their thinking claim this is in fact the case, and that this choreography with the dramatic pronouncements at Stormont are all part of the script. But today their public ire made it nigh impossible for the PM to proceed. I'm told 20 minutes after Foster's press conference, she received a call from the prime minister, in which it was made plain that the DUP could not support the proposed deal. They were not prepared to put up with something that looked like it was a victory for Dublin that was, in the DUP's view, ambiguous on Northern Ireland. Theresa May had broken off her talks with Jean-Claude Juncker to hear that she would not be able to claim victory today. She then went back into the meeting, and shortly after made her grim statement alongside him. Number 10 sources insist that it was not all about the DUP, saying citizens' rights are still to be completely resolved, as well as the issue of the border. But having moved mountains to please Dublin, the prime minister now has a big problem with her supporters in Belfast. Most painful, perhaps, because her reliance on the DUP is a problem of her own making. Had she not made the biggest mistake of her career in calling the election, they would not be able to call the shots. It feels like a big blow for the UK government today because it is. The prime minister would not have invested her own political capital by coming to Brussels today if the government didn't believe that a deal was highly likely. It is deeply embarrassing, therefore, for her to go home empty handed. But it doesn't mean at all that it's all over. Sometimes difficult negotiations even need a bust-up before a breakthrough. Theresa May is likely to be back in Brussels later this week - she'll hope that tradition of near-defeat before eventual victory rings true this time. And don't forget, this is only the end game of the first phase. Nothing about Brexit was politically going to be easy without a majority. Day-by-day now, the government is finding out why. What happens now that a deal's been done? Is the moment of truth approaching for Brexit talks?

Wild crops pushed to brink of extinctionWild relatives of modern crops deemed crucial for food security are threatened with extinction.2h2 hours agoScience & Environment,"Wild wheat can be bred with modern crops to boost resilience Wild relatives of modern crops deemed crucial for food security are being pushed to the brink of extinction, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature. More than 20 rice, wheat and yam plants have been listed as threatened on the latest version of the IUCN's Red list. The wild plants are being squeezed out by intensive farming, deforestation and urban sprawl, say scientists. Modern crops can be crossbred with their wild cousins to safeguard foods. ''To lose them would be a disaster,'' said Dr Nigel Maxted of the University of Birmingham, who is co-chair of the IUCN's specialist group on crop wild relatives. ''It would be much more difficult to maintain food security without them.'' Commercial crops have lost genetic diversity. They are vulnerable to the effects of climate change, which may bring drought, diseases and new pests. Work is under way to breed new varieties of grains, cereals and vegetables by crossing them with tough, wild species that can grow in a range of habitats, such as mountains, deserts or salt marshes. Researchers are collecting wild relatives of crops in Nepal These efforts rely on protecting plants related to modern food crops at the sites where they grow in the wild as well as preserving their seeds in gene banks. The first systematic assessment of wild wheat, rice and yam has led to the listing of three types of rice, two types of wheat (used to make bread) and 17 types of yam. Marie Haga is Executive Director of The Crop Trust, an international organisation that is working to safeguard crop diversity. She welcomed the inclusion of wild crops on the Red List. ''The IUCN has high legitimacy among decision makers and the general population, so it's extremely interesting that they are putting these wild relatives on their Red List,'' she told BBC News. ''I hope that will contribute to raising the awareness even further that we've got to take action, and we've got to take action now.'' Wild relatives of crops act as ''an insurance policy for the world'', she added. Rice grows wild in Nepal Most of the wild rice crops that are threatened with extinction grow in South East Asia, while a few are found in Africa. The wild wheat plants that are of concern are found mainly in the Near and Middle East, including war-torn areas that are off-limits to conservationists. Yams feed around 100 million people in Africa alone. Paul Wilkin of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, said conservation work is being undertaken to make sure that wild yam plants are available to provide food and medicines worldwide, now and in the future. ''They will also be sources of key traits to breed improved, future-proof crop varieties,'' he said. ''These assessments enable the most threatened species of yams and other crop wild relatives to be prioritised effectively for conservation actions.'' The economic value of crop wild relatives is put at US$115bn per year to the global economy. In addition to wild crops, the IUCN highlighted other flora and fauna that have been added to the latest update of the Red List: Entanglement with fishing nets and overfishing have caused steep declines in the Irrawaddy dolphin and finless porpoise, with both species moving from Vulnerable to Endangered Three reptiles found only on Australia's Christmas Island have been declared extinct in the wild Australia's western ringtail possum is in dramatic decline due to the increasingly hot and dry climate in Western Australia and predation from red foxes and feral cats A third of snakes and lizards native to Japan are listed as Threatened, due to habitat loss, collection for the pet trade and the introduction of predators such as the Japanese weasel.

"One in five often miss GP appointmentsYoung men are the worst offenders, a new study examining the problem finds.7h7 hours agoHealth","Up to one in five patients is regularly missing GP appointments in Scotland, new research reveals. A study of more than 500,000 people in the country found poorer patients living in affluent areas were the most likely to miss an appointment. ""No-showers"" tended to be aged 16 to 30, or older than 90, according to the researchers from Lancaster, Glasgow and Aberdeen Universities. The study findings are published The Lancet Public Health journal. There is no centrally collected data on total number of GP appointments or how many of them are missed. The study found 19% of patients missed more than two appointments in a three-year period. Those appointments that were booked two or three days in advance were more likely to be missed than those made two weeks in advance. Social deprivation was the biggest predictor. David Ellis, of the University of Lancaster, one of the lead authors of the study, says the research has identified where doctors' surgeries need to focus their efforts. ""Some of the solutions might include practices learning to better manage patients who are more likely to not attend. ""So for example that might mean giving more appointments on the day than say, two to three days in advance. ""And because we've already got a kind of profile of what those patients might look like who are more likely to not attend, that's where the more targeted interventions could be pushed."" But Stockport GP Ranjit Gill believes there has been a shift in how the health service is seen by a younger ""I want it now"" generation. Dr Gill says missed appointments cost the NHS time and money ""The NHS is now, for our younger population, seen as a consumer service, a bit like John Lewis and so perhaps valued differently to the way our older population see the NHS. ""I can't think of the last time one of my older patients ever missed an appointment."" And Dr Gill points out that as well as the financial loss to the health service, a missed GP appointment also represents a loss of valuable time. ""We have to check for each missed appointment that there wasn't a worrying reason behind that missed appointment whether it be mental health, safeguarding issues or other welfare concerns about patients. ""That takes time and that's a lost opportunity again, for that patient and other patients as well."" Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard, chairwoman of the Royal College of GPs, says it can be frustrating for doctors when patients don't turn up to their appointments. ""Whilst practices will always try to offer appointments that are timely and convenient for patients, the current resource and workforce pressures we are facing, with GPs conducting more consultations than ever before to meet increasing demand, is making this more and more difficult. ""GP practices across the country are already implementing some successful schemes to reduce missed appointments, from text messaging reminders to better patient education and awareness posters detailing the unintended consequences of a patient not attending. ""But ultimately, we need NHS England's GP Forward View - promising Â£2.4bn extra a year for general practice and 5,000 more GPs - to be delivered in full and as a matter of urgency. ""And we need equivalent promises made and delivered in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, so that we can deliver the care our patients need, whatever their circumstances, and wherever in the country they live."" In 2014, NHS England estimated that more than 12 million GP visits are missed each year in the UK. That could cost the health service in excess of Â£162m per year.Â GP surgery's missed appointments plea Thousands of GP appointments missed Cost of missed appointments Â£1m-a-year The Lancet Public Health Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser At least two killed and 1,000 structures destroyed as wildfires rage in Los Angeles In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Why does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?

Wild crops pushed to brink of extinctionWild relatives of modern crops deemed crucial for food security are threatened with extinction.6m6 minutes agoScience & Environment,"Wild wheat can be bred with modern crops to boost resilience Wild relatives of modern crops deemed crucial for food security are being pushed to the brink of extinction, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature. More than 20 rice, wheat and yam plants have been listed as threatened on the latest version of the IUCN's Red list. The wild plants are being squeezed out by intensive farming, deforestation and urban sprawl, say scientists. Modern crops can be crossbred with their wild cousins to safeguard foods. ''To lose them would be a disaster,'' said Dr Nigel Maxted of the University of Birmingham, who is co-chair of the IUCN's specialist group on crop wild relatives. ''It would be much more difficult to maintain food security without them.'' Commercial crops have lost genetic diversity.

"10,000 Google staff to tackle extremists","Google will dedicate more than 10,000 staff to rooting out violent extremist content on YouTube in 2018, the video sharing website's chief has said. Writing in the Daily Telegraph,external, Susan Wojcicki said some users were exploiting YouTube to ""mislead, manipulate, harass or even harm"". She said the website, owned by Google, had used ""computer-learning"" technology that could find extremist videos. More than 150,000 of these videos have been removed since June, she said. In March, the UK government suspended its adverts from YouTube, following concerns they were appearing next to inappropriate content. And in a speech at the United Nations general assembly in September, UK Prime Minister Theresa May challenged tech firms to take down terrorist material in two hours. The prime minister has repeatedly called for an end to the ""safe spaces"" she says terrorists enjoy online. Google launches UK 'anti-terror fund' May warns tech firms on terror content Tech firms fight back in extremism row Ms Wojcicki said that staff had reviewed nearly two million videos for violent extremist content since June. This is helping to train the company's machine learning technology to identify similar videos, which is enabling staff to remove nearly five times as many videos as they were previously, she said. She said the company was taking ""aggressive action"" on comments, using technology to help staff find and shut down hundreds of accounts and hundreds of thousands of comments. And its teams ""work closely with child safety organisations around the world to report predatory behaviour and accounts to the correct law enforcement agencies"". Meanwhile, police in the UK have warned thatsex offenders are increasingly using live online streaming platformsto exploit children. Google pledge to tackle terror videos Earlier this year, Google announced it would give a total of Â£1m ($1.3m) to fund projects that help counter extremism in the UK. And, in June, YouTube announced four new steps it was taking to combat extremist content: Improving its use of machine learning to remove controversial videos Working with 15 new expert groups, including the Anti-Defamation League, the No Hate Speech Movement, and the Institute for Strategic Dialogue. Tougher treatment for videos that are not illegal but have been flagged by users as potential violations of its policies on hate speech and violent extremism Redirecting people who search for certain keywords towards a playlist of curated YouTube videos that directly confront and debunk violent extremist messages Calum Chace, author of Surviving AI and The Economic Singularity, said that machine learning is developing fast. ""People are often unduly cynical about the prospects for AI because they judge it by what is possible today,"" he said. ""They forget that our machines are on an exponential growth curve: they get twice as powerful every 18 months or so. This means that we are just at the beginning of their story. ""Although YouTube's automated systems are probably among the best in the world since it is a subsidiary of Google, they need human support. For now.""

UK's birds 'affected by changing climate',"Migrating swallows cover 200 miles a day Migratory birds are arriving in the UK earlier each spring and leaving later each autumn, a report has confirmed. Some visitors are now appearing more than 20 days earlier than they did in the 1960s, according to the state of the UK's birds 2017 report. The swallow, for instance, is arriving 15 days earlier than 50 years ago. Ongoing monitoring is essential to track the future effects of a changing climate on birds, says a coalition of wildlife organisations. The report is by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB), the British Trust for Ornithology (BTO) , the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust (WWT) and the UK's nature conservation bodies. It pulls together data from the latest bird surveys and monitoring studies. The report warns that there will be winner and losers in a changing world, with opportunities for some bird species but higher extinction risks for others. Some, such as the night heron, are breeding in the UK for the first time as their range expands north, while others, such as the snow bunting are in decline. Dr Daniel Hayhow, lead author of the report, said familiar species such as swallows and sand martins are changing their migratory behaviour. ''We need to take that almost as a warning sign,'' he told BBC News. ''The report is aiming to show to people that these changes are happening and there is potential for such changes in timing to cause a mismatch between the time when the chicks need to be fed and the food that's available for them, meaning they may be less successful in their breeding.'' Migratory birds such as the swallow have long been symbols of the changing seasons. But, climate change appears to be having an impact on their delicate seasonal clocks. The UK's Slavonian grebe population declined by 61% over 25 years Arriving at the wrong time, even by a few days, may cause birds to miss out on food and nesting places, which in turn affects their chances of survival. The report found that the distribution, numbers and behaviours of birds are changing: A large number of bird species, such as the little bittern and the night heron, will have the opportunity to thrive in the UK, if there is suitable wetland habitat for them to breed Climate change will add to the threats faced by some rare birds already in decline, such as the common scoter and Slavonian grebe Birds that feed largely on sandeels, such as the Arctic tern and puffin, are at high risk of climate-related decline. Birds are being monitored for signs of decline Dr Stuart Newson of the BTO said thousands of volunteers have submitted observations over many decades to show how birds like the cuckoo, swallow and house martin have responded to a changing climate. ''Ongoing monitoring is essential if we are to track the future effects of a changing climate on our birds,'' he said. Collette Hall, monitoring officer at WWT, said it is vital to continue to monitor the bird population in the UK. ''We also need to think beyond the UK and make sure that the protected site network continues to cover the right places throughout Europe and that they're monitored elsewhere as thoroughly as they are in the UK,'' she said.

"Ocean plastic a 'planetary crisis' - UNLife in the seas risks irreparable damage if we don't act now, the UN's head of oceans says.5h5 hours agoScience & Environment","Plastic waste has a variety of detrimental effects on the environment Life in the seas risks irreparable damage from a rising tide of plastic waste, the UN oceans chief has warned. Lisa Svensson said governments, firms and individual people must act far more quickly to halt plastic pollution. ""This is a planetary crisis,"" she said. ""In a few short decades since we discovered the convenience of plastics, we are ruining the ecosystem of the ocean."" She was speaking to BBC News ahead of a UN environment summit in Nairobi. Delegates at the meeting want tougher action against plastic litter. 'Shame and anger' at plastic pollution Plastic 'threat' to Scottish wildlife Chemical clue to why birds eat plastic Ms Svensson had just been saddened by a Kenyan turtle hospital which treats animals that have ingested waste plastic. She saw a juvenile turtle named Kai, brought in by fishermen a month ago because she was floating on the sea surface. Plastic waste was immediately suspected, because if turtles have eaten too much plastic it bloats their bellies and they can't control their buoyancy. Kai was given laxatives for two weeks to clear out her system, and Ms Svensson witnessed an emotional moment as Kai was carried back to the sea to complete her recovery. ""It's a very happy moment,"" she said. ""But sadly we can't be sure that Kai won't be back again if she eats more plastic. ""It's heart-breaking, but it's reality. We just have to do much more to make sure the plastics don't get into the sea in the first place."" Caspar van de Geer runs the turtle hospital for the group Local Ocean Conservation at Watamu in eastern Kenya. He had demonstrated earlier how uncannily a plastic film pulsating in the water column mimics the actions of the jellyfish some turtles love to eat. ""Turtles aren't stupid,"" he said. ""It's really difficult to tell the difference between plastics and jellyfish, and it may be impossible for a turtle to learn."" On a pin board he's compiled a grid of sealed clear plastic bags like the ones used at airports for cosmetics. Here they contain the plastic fragments removed from the stomachs of sick turtles. Half of the turtles brought here after eating plastics have died. A huge table at the hospital is laden with an array of plastic waste collected off local beaches - from fishing nets and nylon ropes to unidentifiable fragments of plastic film. Many seabirds, such as this albatross, accidentally eat plastic There's waste from down the coast as far as Tanzania - but also from Madagascar, the Comoros Islands, Thailand, Indonesia and even a bottle from far-away Japan. There's a score of mysterious white plastic rings which staff speculate are the rims of yoghurt pots, a plastic lighter. There are disintegrating woven plastic fertiliser bags, plastic straws - and much more. Bite marks show some items like small suncream bottles have clearly been nibbled at by fish, because they look like potential food. Local people scour the beach daily for plastic waste. They want clean beaches, and they're aware that local hotels want the same. But along the high water line millions of the fragments of plastics are mixed in with dried sea grass, too small to be collected. ""The scale of the challenge is absolutely enormous,"" says Ms Svensson. She's backing a resolution by Norway this week for the world to completely eliminate plastic waste into the ocean. If all nations agree to that long-term goal it'll be considered a UN success. Certainly, it sounds more ambitious than the current commitment to substantially decrease waste inputs into the sea by 2025. But some environmentalists argue that the absence of a timetable for preventing waste is a huge failing. Tisha Brown from Greenpeace told BBC News: ""We welcome that they are looking at a stronger statement, but with billions of tonnes of plastic waste entering the oceans we need much more urgent action. ""We need manufacturers to take responsibility for their products - and we need to look at our consumption patterns that are driving all this."" Indonesia - the world's second biggest plastics polluter after China - has pledged to reduce plastic waste into the ocean 75% by 2025, but some observers doubt legal rules are strong enough to make this happen. Plastic waste is also on the agenda for this month's China Council - an influential high level dialogue in which world experts advise China's leaders on environmental issues. Kenya itself has banned single-use plastic bags, along with Rwanda, Tanzania and - soon- Sri Lanka. Bangladesh has had controls for many years, especially to stop bags clogging up drains and causing floods. The crisis threatens a variety of marine animals, including turtles But bags are just one part of the problem - there are so many other types of plastic flowing through waterways. ""The UN process is slow,"" Ms Svensson admitted. ""It could take 10 years to get a UN treaty agreed on plastic litter and a further two years to get it implemented. ""We have to progress through the UN because this is a truly global problem - but we can't wait that long. ""We need to get much stronger actions from civil society, putting pressure on business to change - they can switch their supply chains very fast. And we need more individual governments to take urgent action too."" She praised the BBC's Blue Planet series and urged other parts of the media to highlight the issue. Ms Svensson said the ocean was facing multiple assault from over-fishing; pollution from chemicals, sewage and agriculture; development in coastal areas;  climate change; ocean acidification; and over-exploitation of coral reefs. ""This is a planetary emergency,"" she said. ""I sense there is a momentum now about the need to act. We just have to be much faster."" As we left Watamu after Kai's joyous release, I turned back for one last glance at the Indian Ocean. A small boy tossed a plastic bottle over his shoulder into the sparkling water.

UN official in rare visit to North KoreaJeffrey Feltman's visit to Pyongyang is the first by a United Nations senior official in six years.1h32 minutes agoAsia,"Mr Feltman is not expected to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong-un The United Nations political affairs chief begins a rare four-day visit to Pyongyang on Tuesday. The trip by Jeffrey Feltman is the first by a senior UN official in six years. North Korea had extended an invitation to the UN in September to visit for a ""policy dialogue"". It comes after last week's launch of what North Korea called its""most powerful"" intercontinental ballistic missile, claiming it could hit the US. Mr Feltman, a former US diplomat and the highest ranking American in the UN, will be in Pyongyang until Friday. His visit comes as South Korea and the US conduct their largest ever round of aerial drills. North Korea: What could tip the balance What do we know about the new missile? What Hwasong-15 launch pictures tell us Triumph, threats follow N Korea missile A UN spokesman told reporters that Mr Feltman will be meeting senior North Korean officials including foreign minister Ri Yong-ho, and will have a wide-ranging policy discussion on ""issues of mutual interest and concern"". He is not scheduled to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. This video can not be played North Korea said in November its latest missile was capable of reaching Washington DC Paul Adams, BBC News, Seoul It wasn't until last week - the day after North Korea's latest missile test - that Pyongyang confirmed the invitation it issued in September. The timing seems significant: Kim Jong-un had just announced his country's success in creating a nuclear force. In the absence of any other meaningful diplomatic channels, the UN clearly believes it's important to pursue whatever opportunities exist for dialogue. On his way to Pyongyang, Mr Feltman held talks in Beijing - no doubt interested to hear what, if anything, came out of China's latest talks with the North Korean regime. China, a historic ally of North Korea and its main trading partner, had sent a top-ranking diplomat to Pyongyang last month for discussions with officials there. The UN has said there are no plans at present for UN chief Antonio Guterres, who has offered to mediate in the North Korean crisis, to visit Pyongyang. The last visit by a senior UN official was whenValerie Amos, then the UN's aid chief, travelled therein October 2011. Mr Feltman's predecessor Lynn Pascoe also visited in 2010. The UN operates six agencies with 50 international staff in North Korea which provide food, agricultural and health aid. Malnutrition is a significant problem in the country. The US has deployed F-22 fighter jets to take part in drills with South Korea Mr Feltman's trip comes during a period of high tensions following North Korea's test launch of a missile which drew another round of international condemnation. The US ambassador to the UNNikki Haley had said last weekthat if war broke out, the North Korean regime would be ""utterly destroyed"". On Monday, South Korea and the US began a five-day air combat exercise, their largest ever involving more than 200 aeroplanes and thousands of troops. North Korea, which routinely condemns such drills, has called it a ""provocation"". N Korea says new missile can hit entire US Triumph, threats follow N Korea missile What North Korean missile pictures tell us How North Korea could tip the balance What do we know about N Korea's new missile?

"Supreme Court backs Trump travel banBut the directive covering Chad, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria and Yemen still faces legal challenges.3h3 hours agoUS & Canada","A woman wears a US flag headscarf as she participates in the #NoMuslimBanEver rally in Los Angeles in October The US Supreme Court has ruled President Donald Trump's travel ban on six mainly Muslim countries can go into full effect, pending legal challenges. The decision is a boost for Mr Trump's policy against travellers from Chad, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria and Yemen. The ruling covers the third version of the directive that the president has issued since taking office. Seven of the nine justices lifted injunctions on Monday imposed by lower courts against the policy. Only liberal Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor would have allowed the president's order to remain blocked. Federal appeals courts in San Francisco, California, and Richmond, Virginia, will hear arguments this week on whether the latest iteration of the policy is lawful. The Supreme Court noted it expects those courts to reach decisions ""with appropriate dispatch"". The case will eventually end up back in the Supreme Court. This video can not be played Muslim students on Trump ban: 'I don't belong here' Monday's decision suggests America's top judicial body may ultimately rule in favour of the administration, say legal analysts. David Levine, a University of California Hastings law school professor, told the Associated Press news agency: ""It suggests that from their understanding, the government is more likely to prevail on the merits than we might have thought."" White House spokesman Hogan Gidley said the White House was ""not surprised"" by the Supreme Court's decision. US Attorney General Jeff Sessions called the ruling ""a substantial victory for the safety and security of the American people"". Trump travel ban: All you need to know Have you been affected by the travel ban? Please emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external But the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) said the president's retweeting of British far-right videos last week showed his discrimination against Islam. ""President Trump's anti-Muslim prejudice is no secret - he has repeatedly confirmed it, including just last week on Twitter,"" ACLU lawyer Omar Jadwat said. ""It's unfortunate that the full ban can move forward for now, but this order does not address the merits of our claims."" This video can not be played ""I feel he has a reason for doing what he's doing"" said one Staten Island resident The president's directives have each been frustrated by the courts to some degree: In January, he signed an order banning people from seven Muslim-majority countries for 90 days and suspending all refugee entry. The measure, which also banned Syrian refugees indefinitely, prompted protests and multiple legal challenges A revised version in March removed Iraq from the list and lifted the indefinite ban on Syrian refugees.By June, the Supreme Court allowedmost of it to go into effect, including a 120-day ban on all refugees entering the US. But it granted a wide exemption for those with a ""bona fide"" connection to the US President Trump's third order was announced in late September. It added non-Muslim-majority nations North Korea and Venezuela, provisions which lower courts have allowed to proceed The US president insisted his ban was necessary for national security and pointed to terrorist attacks in Paris, London, Brussels and Berlin as evidence. But in striking it down, federal judges have cited Mr Trump's campaign description of his policy as a ""Muslim ban"" and his call for ""a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States"". Lower courts across the US have said the president's policy violated the first amendment of the US constitution covering freedom of religion. In October, a Maryland federal judge said: ""The 'initial' announcement of the Muslim ban, offered repeatedly and explicitly through President Trump's own statements, forcefully and persuasively expressed his purpose in unequivocal terms."" A federal judge in Hawaii said the policy ""plainly discriminates based on nationality"" in violation of ""the founding principles of this nation.""

Probe into Bulger killer's ID 'breach'There is a worldwide ban on publishing anything revealing Jon Venables' current identity.8h8 hours agoLiverpool,"Jon Venables was 10 when he and Robert Thompson killed James Bulger A potential breach of a court order which prevents the identification of one of James Bulger's killers is being investigated, the Attorney General's Office has confirmed. Jon Venables, now 35, was convicted of killing two-year-old James in Merseyside in 1993, along with Robert Thompson. The pair were released in 2001. There is a worldwide ban on publishing anything revealing their current identities. A spokesperson for the Attorney General's Office said: ""We have received a complaint that the anonymity order has been breached and we are investigating."" A High Court injunction prohibits the publication of any images or information claiming to identify or locate the pair- even if it is not actually them. The order also covers material published on the internet. In 2013 two men who published photographs on Twitter and Facebook said to show the killers of James Bulgerreceived suspended jail sentencesfor being in contempt of court. Venables wasrecalled to prisonlast month after being suspected of having child abuse images on his computer. It is the second time he has been sent back to jail for the same suspected offence. He was first recalled in 2010, following his release in 2001 after serving eight years for the murder of James, aged two, in 1993. James Bulger was two when he was abducted and killed in 1993 On 12 February 1993, James - just a few weeks before his third birthday - was reported missing by his mother from outside a butcher's shop in the New Strand Shopping Centre in Bootle, Merseyside. CCTV images revealed he had been lured away by Venables and Thompson, both then aged 10. His body was found two days later on a railway line. Thompson and Venables were arrested and charged within days. They were both convicted at Preston Crown Court of James's murder, in November 1993. In 2001, the pair were released - with new identities - from secure children's homes on life licence, meaning they can be recalled at any time.

UK and EU fail to strike Brexit talks deal,"The UK and EU have failed to reach an agreement to move to the next stage of Brexit talks, Theresa May has said. The prime minister said talks would reconvene ""before the end of the week"" and she was ""confident we will conclude this positively"". The talks are understood to have broken down after the Democratic Unionist Party refused to accept concessions on the Irish border issue. Downing Street said that was not the only outstanding problem. Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said a deal had been done, but the UK appeared to change its mind over the Irish border question after pressure from the DUP. ""I am surprised and disappointed that the British government now appears not to be in a position to conclude what was agreed earlier today,"" he told a press conference in Dublin. Ireland 'disappointed' at no deal on Brexit Kuenssberg: What on earth happened? What will happen to EU citizens in the UK? Sturgeon calls for 'special' Brexit deals BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said: ""Is it a complete disaster? No. Does it mean this whole process is totally doomed? No, it does not. Is it a pretty significant disappointment? Yes, it is. ""Officially, the line out of government tonight is that Number 10 was not taking a deal for granted... but a government source has actually told me that as recently as this morning the prime minister was told that the DUP had been squared off."" Northern Ireland's DUP has 10 MPs at Westminster, and their support is vital to the government. This is because the Conservatives are without a Commons majority since June's general election, and rely on a deal with the DUP to ensure they can survive key votes. How the talks broke down Mrs May is understood to have broken off from talks with European Commission President Jean-Claude Junker to speak to DUP leader Arlene Foster. The UK had reportedly been prepared to accept that Northern Ireland may remain in the EU's customs union and single market in all but name. But Mrs Foster then said her party ""will not accept any form of regulatory divergence"" that separates Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK. ""During the call it was made plain to the PM that the DUP had significant concerns about the deal being discussed that gave concessions to the Dublin government,"" said the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg. ""I understand Mrs Foster told Theresa May that she would not be able to support such a deal. ""It's been suggested too that there are 20 or so Conservative MPs who had serious misgivings about the compromises that were understood to be on the table."" This video can not be played DUP accuses Dublin of trying to change the Good Friday agreement unilaterally DUP leader Arlene Foster said her party would not accept any Brexit deal that ""separates"" Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK. Her party's Brexit spokesman Sammy Wilson claimed Brussels has been trying to ""bounce the prime minister into acceding to the shape of a deal they want"" and many of her own backbenchers would not accept it. He said the DUP objected to the form of words used in a draft document, which he said referred to ""regulatory alignment"" and ""no regulatory divergence"" between Northern Ireland and the EU. Both phrases were ""simply EU speak for keeping Northern Ireland in the European market"" and ""in effect, part of the United Kingdom would be kept within the single market,"" he said. Asked if the DUP would pull out of the confidence and supply agreement they have with the Conservative government in Westminster over this issue, he said: ""I think that her (Theresa May) problem isn't going to be just with the DUP"". This video can not be played Irish PM Leo Varadkar ""surprised and disappointed"" Leo Varadkar says he wants a written guarantee that there will be no return to a ""hard border"" between the Republic and Northern Ireland - and this is what he thought he had got. ""I am surprised and disappointed that the British government now appears not to be in a position to conclude what was agreed earlier today,"" he said. ""I accept that the prime minister has asked for more time and I know that she faces many challenges, and I acknowledge that she is negotiating in good faith. ""But my position and that of the Irish government is unequivocal: Ireland wants to proceed to phase two. ""However, we cannot agree to do this unless we have firm guarantees that there will not be a hard border in Ireland under any circumstances."" He said it was important to listen to the DUP, but also to bear in mind the position of other parties in Northern Ireland - and it should not be forgotten that the majority in Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU. This video can not be played Theresa May is ""confident we will conclude this positively"" Speaking at a joint press conference in Brussels with Mr Juncker, Mrs May said: ""We have been negotiating hard. And a lot of progress has been made. And on many of the issues there is a common understanding. ""And it is clear, crucially, that we want to move forward together. ""But on a couple of issues some differences do remain which require further negotiation and consultation."" This video can not be played Jean Claude-Juncker says it was not possible to reach complete agreement in the Brexit talks, but ""significant progressâ was ma The European Commission President said ""it was not possible to reach complete agreement today"" despite their ""best efforts"". But he added: ""I have to say that we were narrowing our positions to a huge extent today, thanks to the British prime minister, thanks to the willingness of the European Commission to have a fair deal with Britain. ""I'm still confident that we can reach sufficient progress before the European Council of 15 December. ""This is not a failure, this is the start of the very last round. ""I'm very confident that we will reach an agreement in the course of this week."" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: ""The real reason for today's failure is the grubby deal the government did with the DUP after the election."" He added that ""Labour has been clear from the outset that we need a jobs-first Brexit deal that works for the whole of the United Kingdom"". Conservative MPs emerging from a Downing Street briefing on the talks said they had been told Mrs May had not agreed the proposal on regulatory alignment put forward by the Irish government. Leading Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg said that the Conservatives were ""as one"" with the DUP on the importance of keeping the United Kingdom together, and the mood among Tory MPs in the meeting was ""contented, not divisive or unhappy"". Backbench Remain supporter Anna Soubry said no Conservative MP wanted Northern Ireland treated differently from the rest of the UK, which she said would be ""a gift"" to the Scottish National Party. The ""simple solution"" would be for the whole of the UK to remain in the single market and customs union, she added. Lib Dem Brexit spokesman Tom Brake said: ""As each day goes by, it becomes clearer that the best deal for everyone is to stay in Europe. The people of the UK must be given a vote on the deal and an opportunity to exit from Brexit."" Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said that if Northern Ireland was allowed to operate under different rules there was ""surely no good practical reason"" why other parts of the UK could not do the same - a message echoed by Welsh First Minister Carwyn Jones and London Mayor Sadiq Khan. The EU says it will only recommend the start of talks about future trade arrangements when it deems ""sufficient progress"" has been made on three issues - the status of expat citizens, the ""divorce"" bill and the Northern Ireland border. The UK has been set a deadline of this week to come forward with an improved offer on them, and hopes that the go-ahead for future talks will then be given at an EU leaders' summit on 14-15 December. On the ""divorce bill"", the UK is understood to have recently increased its offer, which could be worth up to 50bn euros (Â£44bn). Reality Check: How do you work out the Brexit bill? On the issue of rights for the three million EU citizens in Britain, the UK has agreed that those who already have permanent residence will not have to pay to apply for settled status. Those making a first time application for the right to stay after Brexit, however, will face a charge - reportedly similar to the cost of applying for a passport. Settled status will grant those who have spent five years in the UK equal rights on healthcare, education, benefits and pensions to British citizens. Ministers have already suggested people legally resident in the UK before an as yet unspecified cut-off date will be allowed to stay and they want to make the process ""as easy as renewing a driving licence"".

May under pressure to get DUP on side,"This video can not be played Labour: May to blame for Brexit 'embarrassment' Ministers say no part of the UK will be treated differently in the Brexit talks as Labour branded their approach an ""embarrassment"". No agreement has been reached with the EU after a DUP backlash against proposals for the Irish border. Brexit Secretary David Davis told MPs the government was close to concluding the first phase of talks. DUP leader Arlene Foster said the text of the deal was a ""big shock"" and ""it was not going to be acceptable."" She told the Republic of Ireland national broadcaster RTÃ that her party only saw the text on Monday morning, despite asking to see it for five weeks. Theresa May, speaking as she welcomed Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy to Downing Street, said talks with the EU had "" made a lot of progress"". ""There are still a couple of issues we need to work on. But we'll be reconvening in Brussels later this week as we look ahead to the December European Council,"" she said. The phone call that never was Mark Devenport: The Brexit linguistic hole Dublin 'to give May space' on Brexit Ruth Davidson: The deal should be UK-wide Mrs Foster was invited to hold talks with Mrs May in London on Tuesday, but the party's Westminster leader met the government's chief whip instead. The meeting lasted for several hours, but sources suggested to the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg that there was not much sign of a breakthrough yet, with a DUP insider saying the deal needed ""radical surgery"", rather than a few word changes. A phone call between Mrs May and Mrs Foster had then been expected this evening, but sources added that it would not go ahead, suggesting it had never been arranged. This video can not be played Citizens' rights, the Irish border and money are the three big negotiation points The UK is due to leave the EU in March 2019 and Mrs May is under pressure to reach agreement on the Northern Ireland border so negotiations can move forward. The prime minister needs the support of the DUP - the Democratic Unionist Party - which is Northern Ireland's largest party and has 10 MPs at Westminster, because she does not have a majority to win votes in the House of Commons. Responding to an urgent question from Labour in the Commons on Tuesday, Mr Davis defended the controversial proposal for ""regulatory alignment"" between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland - intended to avoid the need for border checks after Brexit - saying this would apply to the whole of the UK. The DUP is unhappy about any agreement which treats Northern Ireland differently. Arlene Foster: We waited five weeks to see draft 'I cannot believe there won't be an agreement' The issue threatening to derail Brexit It would not mean ""having exactly the same rules"" as the EU, Mr Davis said, but would involve ""sometimes having mutually recognised rules"". Backbencher Jacob Rees-Mogg warned that having ""regulatory divergence"" from the EU after Brexit was a ""red line"". This video can not be played Davis: We are making Brexit progress Labour's Brexit spokesman Sir Keir Starmer said that when the DUP objected to the draft agreement, ""fantasy met brutal reality"", adding: ""The DUP tail is wagging the Tory dog."" Mr Starmer also called for the government to drop its plan to enshrine the 29 March 2019 Brexit date in UK law. Meanwhile, former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith suggested the UK should walk away from the negotiations if the EU does not change its position. This video can not be played Iain Duncan Smith: EU needs to 'back off' or 'move on' But Tory MP and former cabinet minister, Nicky Morgan, said his comments were ""madness"" and walking away would ""betrays the futures of millions of young people and those who never wanted to leave in the first place"".

The DUP has said ""it is not a question of us budging"" as the talks were between the UK and the EU Dublin - which as an EU member is part of its single market and customs union - has been calling for written guarantees that a ""hard border"" involving customs checks on the island of Ireland will be avoided after Brexit It is concerned this could undermine the 1998 peace treaty - theGood Friday Agreementthat brought an end to 30 years of sectarian conflict in Northern Ireland. Mr Davis said that while the ""integrity"" of the single market and customs union must be respected after Brexit, it was ""equally clear we must respect the integrity of the United Kingdom"" and individual nations could not have separate arrangements. Mrs May needs to show ""sufficient progress"" has been made so far on ""divorce"" issues before European leaders meet on 14 December to decide whether to allow talks on future trade relations to begin. The three issues that need to be resolved are the Northern Ireland border, citizens' rights and the amount of money the UK will pay as it leaves. Brexitcast: Listen to the BBC's podcast special European press sees May on 'razor edge' Talks between Mrs May and European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker broke up without agreement on Monday, after the DUP objected to a draft agreement on the future of the Irish border. Key to the row is how closely aligned Northern Ireland's regulations will be with those of the Republic of Ireland, and the rest of the EU, in order to avoid a ""hard"" border. This video can not be played Irish PM Leo Varadkar said he was ""surprised and disappointed"" Ireland's deputy prime minister Simon Coveney said Dublin would not budge from its position on the border. The EU is treating the row as a ""domestic British political issue"", BBC Brussels correspondent Adam Fleming said. ""The show is now in London,"" said a European Commission spokesman. Downing Street has insisted the border was not the only outstanding problem and disagreement remains over the role of the European Court of Justice in overseeing EU citizens' rights in the UK after Brexit.

Yemen powerbroker dies in Sanaa fightingEx-President Saleh's death came after he changed sides in Yemen's long-running civil war.5h5 hours agoMiddle East,"Ali Abdullah Saleh became an ally of the Houthis after Yemen's civil war began in 2015 Former Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh has been killed amid fighting between his supporters and their former allies, the Houthi rebel movement. Officials from Mr Saleh's General People's Congress party said he died in an attack south of the capital, Sanaa. The Houthis' leader hailed the news as a ""great and significant occasion"". Abdul Malik al-Houthi said they had foiled a ""conspiracy"" by a Saudi-led coalition backing the government, to whom Mr Saleh had made peace overtures. Meanwhilethe United Nations said air strikes on Sanaa had intensified,externaland the fighting was spreading to other governorates such as Hajjah. The report, by the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, said roads had been blocked and tanks were on the streets. Some of the fiercest fighting was in the diplomatic area near the UN compound. Yemen's future looks grim after Saleh's killing The Red Cross estimates that at least 125 people have been killed and more than 230 people injured since clashes broke out on Friday. The UN Humanitarian Coordinator in Yemen, Jamie McGoldrick, called for a humanitarian pause on 5 December to allow civilians to leave their homes and seek assistance, and for aid workers to continue life-saving programmes. ""They don't know what's coming next...  Children and young people - it's terribly sad,"" he told the BBC. ""And for us we're in the situation we can't help them because we're equally locked down and we have not got the ability to address their needs the way we should."" Ali Abdullah Saleh, Yemen's dominant force Yemen conflict: Who is fighting whom? Until recently, Saleh loyalists had been fighting alongside the Houthis in a war against the current president, Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi. But a dispute over control of Sanaa's biggest mosque on Wednesday triggered armed clashes that have left more than 125 people dead. On Saturday, Mr Saleh offered to ""turn a new page"" with the Saudi-led coalition if it stopped attacking Yemen and ended its crippling blockade of the country. The Houthis accused him of a ""coup"" against ""an alliance he never believed in"". By Sunday, Houthi fighters had taken control of much of the capital and fierce battles were taking place around the homes of Mr Saleh's family and their allies. Saudi-led coalition air strikes overnight failed to stop the Houthis and on Monday morning Mr Saleh's own home was overrun. Soon afterwards, reports began to emerge that he had been killed. Houthi fighters attacked and took control of Mr Saleh's home in central Sanaa on Monday A video circulated on social media showing the body of a man resembling Mr Saleh with a severe head wound. It was being carried on a blanket by armed men shouting ""Praise be to God!"" and ""Hey Ali Affash!"" - the name of Mr Saleh's clan. Later, officials in the General People's Congress confirmed Mr Saleh's death. They said a convoy that he and other party officials were in came under fire from Houthi fighters as they fled south towards the former leader's hometown of Sanhan. Some reports say that he was taken out of his vehicle after it was stopped by an RPG rocket and summarily killed. Houthi leader Abdul Malik al-Houthi celebrated what he called ""the day of the fall of the treasonous conspiracy"".  He also insisted the Houthis had ""no problem"" with the GPC or its members. However, an unnamed GPC official told Saudi-owned Al Arabiya TV that the Yemeni people should ""take to the street and rise up against the Houthi militias"". Dozens of people reportedly died in clashes over the weekend Mr Hadi offered his condolences to the families of ""honourable men"" killed in the last few days in Sanaa, ""most notably former President Ali Abdullah Saleh"". He also called for an ""uprising"" against the Houthis, denouncing them as ""criminal gangs"". The UN meanwhile called for a humanitarian pause in the fighting on Tuesday,external. It said civilians were trapped in their homes, supplies of food and fuel were running low, and that hospitals were unable to treat the wounded. Yemen: Finding near-famine - and lots of food Civilians pay price of blockade By Frank Gardner, BBC security correspondent The death of Ali Abdullah Saleh at the hands of the Houthis now makes any immediate prospect of peace even less likely. Together, Mr Saleh's forces and the Houthis were strong enough to hold on to Sanaa and repel the forces of Yemen's internationally-recognised government and its Gulf Arab allies from much of the mountainous north. Cracks had recently been showing in that alliance, with Mr Saleh turning his back on the Houthis and hinting at a deal with the Saudis. He appears to have paid for it with his life, meeting a similarly ignominious end as that suffered by Libya's Muammar Gaddafi in 2011. Mr Saleh's supporters, who are well-armed, will now seek revenge, probably supported by the very Saudi air strikes that had previously been targeting them. Mr Saleh, who was 77, came to power as president of North Yemen in 1978. When it united with South Yemen in 1990 he became president of the new republic. The Houthis, who champion Yemen's Zaidi Shia minority, fought a series of rebellions against Mr Saleh between 2004 and 2010. They also supported an uprising in 2011 that forced Mr Saleh to hand over power to his deputy, Mr Hadi. Tensions with the Houthis rose after Mr Saleh's party held a rally in Sanaa in August Mr Saleh formed an alliance with the Houthis in 2014, when they seized Sanaa amid widespread disillusionment at the political transition. In early 2015, the allies ousted Mr Hadi and forced him to flee abroad, prompting the Saudi-led campaign. Since then, more than 8,670 people have been killed and 49,960 injured. The conflict and a blockade by the coalition have also left 20.7 million people in need of humanitarian aid, created the world's largest food security emergency, and led to a cholera outbreak that is thought to have killed 2,211 people since April.

Nazi-salute man drove at curry shop owner,"Marek Zakrocki shouted ""white power"" before using his van as a weapon A supporter of the far-right group Britain First gave a Nazi salute and drove at a curry house owner during a drunken rampage in London. The Old Bailey heard Marek Zakrocki shouted ""white power"" before using his van as a weapon outside Spicy Night in Harrow on 23 June. The 48-year-old window fitter was heard to say ""I'm going to kill a Muslim. I'm doing it for Britain"". He pleaded guilty to dangerous driving and beating his wife. Prosecutor Denis Barry said: ""Mr Zakrocki had plainly, during the course of that afternoon, had far too much to drink. ""During the course of that evening he assaulted his wife, drove off in his work vehicle, insulted a series of passers-by and then drove his vehicle at the owner of a curry house, breaking the window of the curry house. ""It's plain that his conduct is very likely to have been motivated by his views about our diverse society."" The drunken rampage took place at the Spicy Night restaurant in Harrow The attack happened on the anniversary of the Brexit vote. The court heard he had also said at the time: ""This is how I'm going to help the country. You people cannot do anything."" Following his arrest by armed officers, a Nazi coin was found in his pocket and copies of Britain First newspapers and flyers at his home in Harrow. Mr Barry said Zakrocki had been ""fixated"" by Muslims and had made donations to Britain First in the past. The court heard Zakrocki's van mounted the pavement twice before making contact with restaurant owner Kamal Ahmed. The windows of the curry house were also smashed during the attack, some of which was caught on CCTV. Jonathan Lennon, defending, said Zakrocki had ""not intended to kill anybody"". Zakrocki will be sentenced later. Further charges of attempting to cause grievous bodily harm and having a knife in Northolt Road, Harrow, were ordered to lie on file.
