Five things we've learned from nature crisis study,"Global trends for insects are not known, but large declines have been recorded in some locations The most comprehensive and detailed review of the state of nature has been published in Paris. Our environment correspondent Matt McGrath extracts the key messages. This phrase was uttered by Prof Sir Bob Watson who has chaired this report from the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES). While Sir Bob went on to explain that there is still hope and much we can do to save nature, I think it's worth dwelling for a moment on just how much trouble we are in. Globally, two billion people rely on wood to meet their primary energy needs. Around 70% of cancer drugs are natural, or are synthetic products inspired by nature. Humans 'threaten 1m species with extinction' Nature's emergency in five graphics The teens saving Madagascar's wildlife Then there's all that water that nature cleans, all the food it provides, all the CO2 it absorbs, all the storms that it blocks. I could go on, but the picture is very plain. Humans are more dependent on nature now than at any time in our history. Over the past 50 years, as the world's population has doubled, we have pulled more people out of poverty than ever before. Humans have chopped and burned their environment in the name of economic development And how have we done it? By burning, poisoning and trashing large sections of the most biodiversity-rich lands and oceans. This has killed off thousands of species and now threatens a million more. ""Nature is changing in part because there's more of us and we are consuming more,"" said one of the IPBES co-ordinating lead authors, Dr Kate Brauman. ""As people become more affluent they have bigger footprints, they eat more they drive more and they fly more."" One key message from the assessment is that we need to re-evaluate what we mean by the idea of a ""good life"". For centuries, in western culture, this has all been about accumulating wealth, working hard, making sacrifices for the benefits of our children. Progress, as defined in many families, has meant children earning more than their parents. More money, more things. ""We need to change the way we think about what a good life is, we need to change the social narrative that puts an emphasis on a good life depending on a high consumption and quick disposal,"" said Prof Sandra Diaz, one of the co-chairs of the IPBES report. In the Americas, the iconic Baltimore oriole is threatened by deforestation ""We need to shift it to an idea of a fulfilling life that is more aligned with a good relationship with nature, and a good relationship with other people, with the public good. ""We need to change the stories in our heads, because they are the ones that are now enacted in decisions all the way from the individual up to government."" She added: ""Changing that is not easy but this is what it would take to reach the better future for the children that are born this year."" One of the major themes of this assessment is the term ""nature's contribution to people"". This is a central concept that the authors really want to drive home. While it looks like a bland bit of bureaucratese, it actually carries a lot of weight. For a long time economists have tried to encourage the idea that the value of nature was best expressed in monetary terms. They have argued that this makes it easier to explain to politicians and citizens that wetlands or pollinators matter because they have value and contribute to the economy in a real financial sense. The phrase they have used to capture this sense of the value of nature is ""ecosystems services"". But some ecologists argue that a financial definition is very damaging for nature, allowing it to be commodified and treated as just another good. The human population is increasing and we are consuming more all the time This new assessment wants the world to move on from measuring nature's value in pounds, dollars or yen. It wants to ensure that the full value of natural resources are taken into account. ""If you have a natural forest it doesn't appear at all in your account books at national level, your wealth is not affected at all,"" said Ina Porras, from the International Institute for Environment and Development. ""The moment you allow the extraction of timber then your GDP will increase - it's only by allowing the destruction of this resource that the economy seems to be growing."" ""What we need to do is change that because that forest is providing many other services that are simply not accounted, if you destroy it, looks as if you are increasing your wealth but you are not."" One of the key differences in this report is that the authors have worked hard to include a broader range of knowledge than in many typically ""western"" scientific studies. They have sought out indigenous and local knowledge and given it due weight in the report. One key finding is that while nature is declining in lands managed by local communities, it is declining less rapidly than in other areas. The authors say that local knowledge and understanding on how to manage nature should be given more weight by governments. We can all learn from them. The Yucatan peninsula of Mexico, has seen evidence of this power of local knowledge in action. This video can not be played ""Species are going extinct at a faster rate than we've seen for millions of years"" - Laura Foster reports After the NAFTA (North American Free Trade Agreement) treaty was signed in 1994, there were expectations that hybrid varieties of maize from the US would swamp local, native breeds. ""The farmers there tell me that the locally adapted traditional varieties of maize do better under climate change with increasing droughts,"" says Dr Rinku Roy Chowdhury, from Clark University in Worcester, Massachusetts, who has worked in the region. ""But they are not sure, so they are hedging their bets and investing in several different varieties. ""It is a really interesting process of decision-making under uncertainty which is we are all trying to do as scientists focused on global change. It is humbling and illuminating to see that we have different types of scientists in these local farmers, thinking and dealing with climate change."" One key takeaway from this report is that political efforts to enshrine protection of nature have fallen desperately flat. Back in 2010, at a meeting of the Convention on Biological Diversity in Aichi, Japan, delegates set themselves a series of targets for conservation for 2020. According to the new assessment, good progress has only been made on four of the 20 goals. The negative trends in species loss will also make the Sustainable Development Goals - the UN blueprint for addressing global challenges such as poverty, environmental degradation and peace - harder to achieve. Sold for a song: Rare birds captured for their tuneful voices Threat to food as biodiversity declines What would a world without humans be like? This will have real consequences for real people as they experience hunger, health issues, water scarcity and poverty in general. So is there any political progress on the horizon? Well, just as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) informed the Paris agreement on global warming in 2015, this IPBES report will inform the talks on a ""new deal for nature and people"". This is due to be negotiated at a key meeting in China next year. If a new global deal on nature is to be struck, then it will probably need the participation of heads of state. Right now, despite the evidence from the IPBES report, that seems a very big ask.

Brilliant Trump wins first world title,"This video can not be played World Championship 2019 final: Record-breaking snooker final and epic shots Judd Trump dismantled John Higgins 18-9 to claim his maiden World Championship title in one of the most breathtaking Crucible finals ever witnessed. In a classic contest, the two shared a record 11 centuries and brought up the 100th ton of the tournament. Trump took total control at 12-5 after the first day in Sheffield, helped by a run of winning eight straight frames. Both missed chances of maximum breaks as Trump went 16-9 up, a lead he did not relinquish in the final session. Trump collects Â£500,000 in prize money, making him the first player in history to amass more than Â£1m in a single season. Trump poised for 'new era of dominance' Punter wins Â£10,000 after bet on Trump 21 years ago Reaction to Trump's remarkable win The Englishman has long been touted as a world champion, previously regarded as one of the best players never to win in Sheffield, but now he has finally fulfilled his potential and moves up to second in the world rankings. ""It is incredible achievement for me from where I was,"" Trump, 29, told BBC Sport. ""I have worked so hard for this. For the people around me this is so special. It was an amazing final, the standard was so high from the very first ball. ""That is probably the best I have ever played in a major final."" This video can not be played 'What a shot!' - standing ovation for Higgins' incredible double In a remarkable exhibition of potting from both players, they took the standard of snooker to another level, making frame-winning breaks of 50 or more in 23 of the 27 frames played. Here is how the numbers stack up: Most centuries in a professional match:Trump and Higgins shared 11 tons, one more than the 10 seen in the 2016 semi-final between Ding Junhui and Alan McManus. Most centuries in a Crucible final:The total of 11 was three more than the previous record of eight, set in 2002 (Stephen Hendry v Peter Ebdon) and 2013 (Ronnie O'Sullivan v Barry Hawkins) Most centuries by a player in a single match:Trump made seven centuries in the final, equalling Ding's record against McManus from 2016 Most tournament centuries overall:There were 100 in the tournament, smashing the previous best of 86 from 2015 and 2016 Six-time world champion Steve Davis said on BBC Two: ""It was amazing. The standard in that final may have been the greatest we have ever seen and Judd Trump was at the heart of it."" Frame scores, century stats and full results One of the pre-tournament favourites, the Bristolian reached the final in part by capitalising on the shock exits of world number one Ronnie O'Sullivan and three-time winner Mark Selby from his half of the draw. This has been by far the best season of Trump's career, winning three ranking titles, and he becomes the first player since Mark Williams in 2003 to claim the double of World Championship and Masters in the same campaign. He has now also completed snooker's Triple Crown following his victory at the UK Championship in 2011. Earlier that year, he was beaten 18-15 in his first world final appearance by Higgins, going agonisingly close with his all-out attacking style of play which he labelled himself as ""naughty snooker"". Some of that was on display again in this final, playing a black with the cue behind his back, which brought a smile from Higgins, and another red down the cushion that was described as ""Alex Higgins-esque"". But he is a complete player now, having won 11 ranking titles in total, turning on the style with heavy scoring and possessing a potent safety game. Trump took apart O'Sullivan at Alexandra Palace in January and this was another demolition job of one of snooker's greats - a run of eight frames in a row and four centuries on the first day setting the platform for a tremendous triumph. This video can not be played Judd Trump showboats his way to a 135 break Seven-time champion Stephen Hendry:""I certainly have not seen anything like that standard in a final, it was incredible. The scoring was phenomenal, every time a player got an opportunity they cleared up in one visit. Judd's performance in the final has been one of the most dominant I have ever seen."" Six-time world champion Steve Davis:""Judd Trump has demolished one of the greatest players to have ever held a cue. It's an astonishing performance. The second session was arguably the most violent and shocking session I have ever seen. I'd have hated to have watched it from John Higgins' perspective. Former champion John Parrott:""What Judd Trump did has usurped his performance at the Masters. What he did was just sensational. I never thought he was that good. I had no idea he was that good."" Overturned a 6-3 deficit to win a thrilling final-frame decider against Thepchaiya Un-Nooh in the first round Fought past Ding Junhui in the second round after going 9-7 down Eased through to the semi-finals with a comfortable 13-6 win over Stephen Maguire Beat qualifier Gary Wilson 17-11 in the semi-final Overwhelmed John Higgins 18-9 in a dazzling final This video can not be played World final is 'the best I've ever played' - Trump Four-time champion Higgins came up short once more having been beaten in 2017 by Selby and Williams last year. The 43-year-old has now lost four finals in Sheffield - only Jimmy White with six has been beaten in more - but he played his part against Trump. Reaching the final was an achievement in itself for Higgins, bringing to an end a poor season by his high standards in which he failed to win a ranking event and hinted at retirement in December. Although he made four centuries in the match, taking his overall tally in Sheffield to 150, he was outclassed by a relentless Trump and admitted he was ""lucky to get nine frames"". ""I was the lucky one to not have to pay for a ticket, he was just awesome,"" the Scot added. ""It will be the first of many I am sure, to produce a standard like that is incredible. He was unplayable. ""I never expected to get to the final, I came up against an unstoppable machine."" This video can not be played World Snooker Championship: Shot of the Championship A dazzling opening day was described by 1997 champion Ken Doherty as ""one of the best ever"" as the two players shared the first eight frames with four centuries and three further breaks over 50. Though Higgins made 125 at the start of the second session, Trump took total control thereafter by winning eight straight frames including two further centuries and runs of 71, 58 and 70. 'The Wizard of Wishaw' came out firing in the third session, sinking a superb double on the 15th red while on a maximum 147 break which was heartily applauded by Trump in his seat, but he missed the next black. Higgins followed it up with 59, but Trump showed his class with knocks of 101 and 71 to go 14-7. Trump, nicknamed 'The Juddernaut', needed to win all four of the following frames to win the match with a session to spare, but Higgins' 67 in the 23rd frame guaranteed an evening finish. He made a further 70 but Trump's brilliant 104 with 13 reds and 13 blacks put him two from victory heading into the final session. Trump's 94 put him on the cusp of snooker's biggest prize, which he took with another cool break of 62.

UK set to fork out Â£15bn on ash dieback,"The issue of biosecurity is set to become increasingly important to prevent alien invasive pathogens entering the UK habitat The outbreak of ash dieback disease is set to cost the UK in the region of Â£15bn, it has been estimated. Scientists expressed shock at the ""staggering"" financial burden on taxpayers. The authors warn that the cost of tackling the fallout from ash dieback far exceeds the income from importing nursery trees. It was an imported nursery tree that initially brought the deadly disease to these shores. They added that it was the first time the total cost of the outbreak had been estimated. This video can not be played How does ash dieback develop? ""We estimate that the total may be Â£15bn,"" explained lead author Dr Louise Hill, a researcher at Plant Sciences at the University of Oxford. ""That's a third more than the reported cost of the foot-and-mouth disease outbreak in 2001. ""The consequences of tree disease for people really haven't been fully appreciated before now."" Young and susceptible ash trees quickly succumb to the pathogen The disease, also known as chalara dieback of ash, was first reported in the UK in a nursery in 2012, and was recorded in the wider environment for the first time in 2013. Since then it has spread to most parts of the UK. The Forestry Commission says it has the ""potential to cause significant damage to the UK's ash population, with implications for woodland biodiversity and ecology, and for the hardwood industries"". In Europe, the pathogen has caused widespread damage and has killed and infected millions of ash trees. As well as estimating the loss from losing an economically important species, the Â£15bn figure takes in account the loss of ""ecosystem services"", such as water purification and carbon sequestration. Report co-author Dr Nick Atkinson, senior adviser at the Woodland Trust, said: ""What we were drawing attention to is that there is this huge financial and economic impact of a tree disease epidemic."" The authors, writing in the Current Biology journal, estimated that the total cost of ash dieback would be 50 times greater than the annual value of trade in live plants to and from Britain. ""What you have to look at is, essentially, the risk we are taking by trading across borders against the benefits, which is the financial gains coming from that market,"" he told BBC News. ""The Â£15bn cost that we are now facing is the direct outcome of a trade that was worth a few million pounds."" The researchers said that the majority of the cost will be shouldered by local authorities. ""As we know, local authorities are not well funded and they are certainly not funded enough to deal with an epidemic of this magnitude,"" observed Dr Atkinson. ""There is this hole in the policy of responding to events like this.""

Harry and MeghanÃ¢ÂÂs child to pay US taxes?,"The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are expecting their first child in April The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have had their first child and along with the excitement and nerves of being new parents could come an unwanted tax bill. As US citizens, Meghan - and her baby son - are liable to pay US taxes. The US is one of only a few countries to charge tax based on citizenship and not residency. Other countries that tax non-resident citizens include Eritrea and Myanmar. This means that even though the duke and duchess will be living at Frogmore Cottage in Windsor, the US government still expects Meghan to file tax returns with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) - the US tax authority. US-born Meghan will pass her US citizenship on to her child That goes for Prince Harry and Meghan's baby too. Any American who has lived in the US in the last five years automatically passes on their citizenship to their offspring. Meghan is expected to apply for UK citizenship, but that process takes time. Ahead of their wedding in 2018, Harry's communication's secretary, Jason Knauf, said Megan would be ""compliant with immigration requirements at all times"". That means she needs to live in the UK for at least five years. Once she is a UK citizen, the duchess could renounce her US citizenship and her tax liability. That process isn't simple either and it requires paying - you guessed it - more taxes. The US government charges an exit tax on all assets owned by anyone above the age of 18-and-a-half years renouncing their citizenship. While the Duchess of Sussex will be able to renounce her US citizenship in a few years when she becomes a UK citizen, her son will have to wait until he is at least 16. Under US law minors under the age of 16,externalare ""presumed not to have the requisite maturity"" to relinquish citizenship. The US and the UK have an agreement that gives US citizens a tax credit based on the amount of tax paid in the UK, but that's unlikely to erase either Meghan's or her son's US tax bill. US citizens living abroad are obliged to file taxes each year reflecting their income, gifts over $15,797 (Â£12,080) assets over $200,000 (Â£152,930) and disclosing any foreign bank accounts and must pay applicable US taxes. Meghan and her baby will have to report any gift they received over the past year if the total value is over $15,797 (Â£12,080) For Meghan, this will include baby shower gifts. Her son's birthdays could become an accounting exercise. Any future income from investments or trusts put in the child's name will also be taxable. ""All the royals are probably beneficiaries of various trusts and they will need to be careful,"" says Sam Ashley, US tax director at The Tax Advisory Partnership. Mr Ashley does not advise any members of the Royal Family but says it's likely the advisers they do have started planning for this a long time ago, possibly even before the wedding. The US requires all citizens - regardless of where they live - to pay taxes As an actress, Meghan was reportedly paid $50,000 per episode of the show Suits. While she is no longer a working actress she will receive some payments whenever the show is rebroadcast. The duke and duchess's expenses - such as living costs, travel, clothing - are covered by Harry's father for their role as working royals, representing the Queen. The Prince of Wales funds his sons and their families with income from the Duchy of Cornwall. It's likely that when Harry accepts any money from his father he keeps his accounts separate from Meghan's to avoid giving the US tax authorities any insight into the Duchy or any other family trusts. Any money given by Prince Charles directly to Meghan or his grandson will have to be declared to the US authorities and will be taxable. The potential exposure of the Royal Family's complicated finances is a bigger risk than a large tax bill. ""The Royal Family likely have some quite complicated trust structures to pass down family wealth and it's unlikely they would want the US to look into that,"" says Mr Ashley. Advisers have probably been planning for Meghan's US tax return since her engagement was announced Most married couples in the US file their taxes jointly, but the duchess will probably file as an individual to avoid revealing her husband's finances. Children who earn under $2,000 can file their taxes with their parents', but a royal baby will possibly have gifts and inherited assets that will have to be declared to the IRS. No matter what insight the US government gains into the Royal Family's finances - and experts stress that is likely to be limited - the public won't get that same view. US tax returns are confidential. But if both royals do give up their status as Americans they won't be alone. Many wealthy and well-known figures have given up their US citizenship and ditched US tax liability. Boris Johnson, former UK foreign secretary Boris Johnson The former foreign secretary relinquished his US citizenship in 2016. He was born in New York to British parents. All children born in the US are automatically US citizens. In 2013 he called the US taxation system ""absolutely outrageous"" when US tax authorities demanded he pay capital gains tax on the sale of his north London home. Prince Albert II of Monaco Prince Albert II of Monaco The son of US actress Grace Kelly found himself in a similar predicament to the one Harry and Meghan's son will soon face. His mother passed on her US citizenship which he renounced at age 21. He became Prince of Monaco in 2005. Tina Turner Tina Turner The US-born singer voluntarily relinquished her citizenship after living in Switzerland for 12 years. Eduardo Saverin Eduardo Saverin The co-founder of Facebook gave up his US citizenship just before the social network became a public company in 2012. He became a citizen of Singapore which does not allow dual nationalities.

Turkey to rerun Istanbul vote after opposition win,"Protests have erupted across Istanbul over the decision to re-run the election Turkey's electoral body has been condemned for ordering Istanbul's local elections to be re-held after an opposition victory in March. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's AK Party had claimed there were ""irregularities and corruption"" behind the opposition CHP's slim win. But CHP's Ekrem Imamoglu, who was confirmed as Istanbul's mayor in April, called the decision ""treacherous"". The vote, which will be held on 23 June, has sparked protests in the city. Hundreds of residents gathered in several districts of Istanbul on Monday, banging pots and pans and shouting anti-government slogans. The European Parliament also said the decision to re-run the election would end the credibility of democratic elections in Turkey. An AKP representative on the electoral board, Recep Ozel, said the re-run was called because some electoral officials were not civil servants and some result papers had not been signed. But CHP deputy chair Onursal Adiguzel said the re-run showed it was ""illegal to win against the AK Party"". Ekrem Imamoglu was confirmed as the mayor of Istanbul in April Mr Adiguzel tweeted that the decision was ""plain dictatorship"". ""This system that overrules the will of the people and disregards the law is neither democratic, nor legitimate,"" he wrote. And in a speech broadcast on social media, Mr Imamoglu condemned the electoral board, saying they were influenced by the ruling party. Turkey's rulers are bad losers, says vote 'winner' Erdogan: Turkey's pugnacious president ""We will never compromise on our principles,"" he told the crowd. ""This country is filled with 82 million patriots who will fight... until the last moment for democracy."" A supporters' group for Mr Imamoglu urged restraint, saying: ""Let's stand together, let's be calm... We will win, we will win again."" President Erdogan was once mayor of Istanbul Municipal elections took place across Turkey on 31 March and were seen as a referendum on Mr Erdogan's leadership amid a sharp economic downturn. Although an AKP Party-led alliance won 51% of the vote nationwide, the secularist CHP claimed victory in the capital Ankara, Izmir, and in Istanbul - where Mr Erdogan had once been mayor. In Istanbul, more than 8 million votes were cast and Mr Imamoglu was eventually declared the winner by a margin of less than 14,000. The ruling party has since challenged the results in Ankara and Istanbul, which has prompted opposition accusations that they are trying to steal the election. President Erdogan was never going to take the loss of Istanbul lying down. ""Whoever wins Istanbul wins Turkey"", he has often said. He is determined to win back the country's economic powerhouse. But it's a strategy fraught with risk. The Turkish lira - which has lost more than 30% over the past year - has slumped again. An economy in recession can hardly cope with more uncertainty. After all, it was economic woes that lost Istanbul for Mr Erdogan in the first place. What's more, Ekrem Imamoglu, who was formally appointed mayor last month, is gaining popularity, fast. He's reached out beyond his base and has settled into the role with ease. The re-run could widen his win - barring major irregularities against him, which many of his supporters fear. And Mr Erdogan's own party is deeply split on the issue. His diehard loyalists believe victory was stolen. But other wings of the party accept they lost, and that rejecting the result is another nail in the coffin for what's left of Turkish democracy.

Line of Duty draws year's biggest audience,"L to R: Line of Duty stars Vicky McClure, Adrian Dunbar and Martin Compston More than nine million viewers tuned into the final episode of Line of Duty on Sunday, giving it the biggest overnight audience of 2019 so far. The tense conclusion to the BBC One drama's fifth series attracted an average audience of 9.1 million, according to overnight figures. Charlotte Moore, the BBC's director of content, said it was ""fantastic to see such a big audience"" for the show. Critics said the episode was ""breathtaking"" and ""deeply satisfying"". Yet some expressed reservations about the series as a whole, saying it has been ""lacklustre"" and the ""weakest"" to date. The BBC has already commissioned a sixth series from writer Jed Mercurio, who also wrote Bodyguard. Line of Duty's figures are the highest for a drama since last year's Bodyguard finale, which drewan overnight audience of 10.4 millionlast September. ITV's royal drama Victoria, which went out at the same time as Line of Duty on Sunday, attracted an average audience of 2.5 million.

US sends aircraft carrier to 'warn Iran',"A file photo from 2004 of the USS Abraham Lincoln, which is currently on its way to the Gulf The US has deployed an aircraft carrier to the Middle East to send a ""clear and unmistakable message"" to Iran. National Security Adviser John Bolton said the administration was acting ""in response to a number of troubling and escalatory indications and warnings"". The deployment of the warship was based on claims of a possible attack on US forces stationed in the region, unnamed US officials are quoted as saying. Mr Bolton added that they would counter any attack with ""unrelenting force"". In a statement, Mr Bolton said: ""The United States is deploying the USS Abraham Lincoln Carrier Strike Group and a bomber task force to the US Central Command region to send a clear and unmistakeable message to the Iranian regime that any attack on United States interests or on those of our allies will be met with unrelenting force."" John Bolton said the US was ""not seeking war"" with Iran He added: ""The United States is not seeking war with the Iranian regime. But we are fully prepared to respond to any attack, whether by proxy, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps or regular Iranian forces."" The ship was already in Europe for war games with US allies that have been taking place since the end of April. Preparing for war? So far there is little detail from the Americans of the alleged Iranian actions that have prompted this warning nor of the specific US deployments under way. It is not unusual for an aircraft carrier and its battle group to be sent to the Gulf. Reinforcing US land-based air assets in the region, albeit temporarily, is less routine. Washington has itself been turning up the pressure on Iran over recent months; designating the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps a terrorist entity; toughening up oil sanctions and so on. But the Trump administration's goal is unclear. Its spokesmen insist that they do not want war with Iran but they can also barely hide their enthusiasm for regime change in Tehran. So is this US move an attempt to guarantee the existing, uneasy status quo ? Or is it an attempt to turn the screw even tighter? Many critics of the administration fear a developing drumbeat towards a conflict which, they fear, could erupt either by accident or by design. The deployment comes amid growing tensions between the US and Iran. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told reporters on a trip to Europe: ""It is absolutely the case that we have seen escalatory actions from the Iranians and it is equally the case that we will hold the Iranians accountable for attacks on American interests."" He did not explain what he meant by ""escalatory actions"", however he added: ""We have good reason to want to communicate clearly about how the Iranians should understand how we will respond to actions they may take."" Last year President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew from a landmark nuclear deal the US and other nations had agreed with Iran in 2015. Under the accord, Iran had agreed to limit its sensitive nuclear activities and allow in international inspectors in return for sanctions relief. And last month the White House said it would end exemptions from sanctions for five countries - China, India, Japan, South Korea and Turkey - that were still buying Iranian oil. How renewed US sanctions have hit Iran hard Is it about to become more expensive to fill my car? At the same timethe US also blacklisted Iran's elite Revolutionary Guard Corps, designating it as a foreign terrorist group. The Trump administration hopes to compel Iran to negotiate a ""new deal"" that would cover not only its nuclear activities, but also its ballistic missile programme and what officials call its ""malign behaviour"" across the Middle East. The sanctions have led to a sharp downturn in Iran's economy, pushing the value of its currency to record lows, driving away foreign investors, and triggering protests. Iran has repeatedly threatened to retaliate to the US measures by blocking the Strait of Hormuz - though which about a fifth of all oil consumed globally pass. US to end Iran oil sanctions exemptions Trump re-imposes Iran sanctions: Now what?

Harry and Meghanâs child to pay US taxes?,"The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are expecting their first child in April The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have had their first child and along with the excitement and nerves of being new parents could come an unwanted tax bill. As US citizens, Meghan - and her baby son - are liable to pay US taxes. The US is one of only a few countries to charge tax based on citizenship and not residency. Other countries that tax non-resident citizens include Eritrea and Myanmar. This means that even though the duke and duchess will be living at Frogmore Cottage in Windsor, the US government still expects Meghan to file tax returns with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) - the US tax authority. US-born Meghan will pass her US citizenship on to her child That goes for Prince Harry and Meghan's baby too. Any American who has lived in the US in the last five years automatically passes on their citizenship to their offspring. Meghan is expected to apply for UK citizenship, but that process takes time. Ahead of their wedding in 2018, Harry's communication's secretary, Jason Knauf, said Megan would be ""compliant with immigration requirements at all times"". That means she needs to live in the UK for at least five years. Once she is a UK citizen, the duchess could renounce her US citizenship and her tax liability. That process isn't simple either and it requires paying - you guessed it - more taxes. The US government charges an exit tax on all assets owned by anyone above the age of 18-and-a-half years renouncing their citizenship. While the Duchess of Sussex will be able to renounce her US citizenship in a few years when she becomes a UK citizen, her son will have to wait until he is at least 16. Under US law minors under the age of 16,externalare ""presumed not to have the requisite maturity"" to relinquish citizenship. The US and the UK have an agreement that gives US citizens a tax credit based on the amount of tax paid in the UK, but that's unlikely to erase either Meghan's or her son's US tax bill. US citizens living abroad are obliged to file taxes each year reflecting their income, gifts over $15,797 (Â£12,080) assets over $200,000 (Â£152,930) and disclosing any foreign bank accounts and must pay applicable US taxes. Meghan and her baby will have to report any gift they received over the past year if the total value is over $15,797 (Â£12,080) For Meghan, this will include baby shower gifts. Her son's birthdays could become an accounting exercise. Any future income from investments or trusts put in the child's name will also be taxable. ""All the royals are probably beneficiaries of various trusts and they will need to be careful,"" says Sam Ashley, US tax director at The Tax Advisory Partnership. Mr Ashley does not advise any members of the Royal Family but says it's likely the advisers they do have started planning for this a long time ago, possibly even before the wedding. The US requires all citizens - regardless of where they live - to pay taxes As an actress, Meghan was reportedly paid $50,000 per episode of the show Suits. While she is no longer a working actress she will receive some payments whenever the show is rebroadcast. The duke and duchess's expenses - such as living costs, travel, clothing - are covered by Harry's father for their role as working royals, representing the Queen. The Prince of Wales funds his sons and their families with income from the Duchy of Cornwall. It's likely that when Harry accepts any money from his father he keeps his accounts separate from Meghan's to avoid giving the US tax authorities any insight into the Duchy or any other family trusts. Any money given by Prince Charles directly to Meghan or his grandson will have to be declared to the US authorities and will be taxable. The potential exposure of the Royal Family's complicated finances is a bigger risk than a large tax bill. ""The Royal Family likely have some quite complicated trust structures to pass down family wealth and it's unlikely they would want the US to look into that,"" says Mr Ashley. Advisers have probably been planning for Meghan's US tax return since her engagement was announced Most married couples in the US file their taxes jointly, but the duchess will probably file as an individual to avoid revealing her husband's finances. Children who earn under $2,000 can file their taxes with their parents', but a royal baby will possibly have gifts and inherited assets that will have to be declared to the IRS. No matter what insight the US government gains into the Royal Family's finances - and experts stress that is likely to be limited - the public won't get that same view. US tax returns are confidential. But if both royals do give up their status as Americans they won't be alone. Many wealthy and well-known figures have given up their US citizenship and ditched US tax liability. Boris Johnson, former UK foreign secretary Boris Johnson The former foreign secretary relinquished his US citizenship in 2016. He was born in New York to British parents. All children born in the US are automatically US citizens. In 2013 he called the US taxation system ""absolutely outrageous"" when US tax authorities demanded he pay capital gains tax on the sale of his north London home. Prince Albert II of Monaco Prince Albert II of Monaco The son of US actress Grace Kelly found himself in a similar predicament to the one Harry and Meghan's son will soon face. His mother passed on her US citizenship which he renounced at age 21. He became Prince of Monaco in 2005. Tina Turner Tina Turner The US-born singer voluntarily relinquished her citizenship after living in Switzerland for 12 years. Eduardo Saverin Eduardo Saverin The co-founder of Facebook gave up his US citizenship just before the social network became a public company in 2012. He became a citizen of Singapore which does not allow dual nationalities.

Russia crash jet 'struck by lightning',"This video can not be played Passengers used emergency exit slides to escape Passengers and crew on board a jet that was forced to make an emergency landing at a Moscow airport say it was struck by lightning moments before it crashed. Reports of the strike came as survivors told how they escaped the Aeroflot jet which burst into flames on landing at Sheremetyevo airport on Sunday. Forty-one of the 78 people on board were killed in the accident. Investigators probing the cause of the crash have made no official comment on the claims it was hit by lightning. Modern aircraft are built to withstand lightning strikes, and Russia's national carrier has said only that the plane returned to the airport for ""technical reasons"". However passengers said the plane, which was heading for the northern Russian city of Murmansk, was struck just after take-off. Pilot Denis Yevdokimov told Russian media that the lightning had interrupted communication with air traffic controllers and forced him to switch to emergency manual mode. Passengers 'were grabbed by collar' Burning plane makes emergency landing Dramatic video showed the plane making a very bumpy landing, bursting into flames after bouncing on the tarmac. Two children and a flight attendant are among the dead.The acting governor of Murmansk, Andrey Chibis, said in a Facebook post,externalthat 26 of the victims were from his region. The plane's so-called black boxes - which record flight data and cockpit conversations - have reportedly been retrieved and handed to investigators. One passenger who survived the crash, Pyotr Yegorov, was quoted as saying that the flight ""had just taken off and the aircraft was hit by lightning"", adding: ""The landing was rough - I almost passed out from fear."" Another survivor, Mikhail Savchenko, said he managed to escape by jumping out onto the emergency exit slides at the front of the Aeroflot jet while the rear was ablaze. A witness said the plane ""jumped like a grasshopper"" as it struck the runway at speed. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Passenger Dmitry Khlebushkin told reporters: ""I'm alive only thanks to the stewardesses. The girls stood there in the smoke, it was dark, extremely hot, but they pulled people out and helped them get down the chutes"". Stewardess Tatyana Kasatkina said people were leaving their seats and heading for the exits while the plane was still travelling, Russian news site Lenta reports. She said passengers were screaming and phoning relatives as the plane burned. ""It all happened really fast, in a matter of secondsâ¦ I was pushing passengers out. I grabbed each one by the collar, so that they wouldn't delay the evacuation."" Passengers were evacuated within 55 seconds of the plane coming to a standstill, the airline said.

Eyewitness Patrick Horlacher told the BBC it was ""shocking to see"" the plane being ravaged by flames just minutes before he was due to board another flight. The aircraft, a Sukhoi Superjet-100, left the airport at 18:02 local time (15:02 GMT) on Sunday, bound for Murmansk. Its crew sent a distress signal when ""malfunctions"" occurred in bad weather shortly after take-off. The pilot, Denis Yevdokimov, said there had been some communication with controllers but that it was sporadic. The aircraft then attempted two emergency landings. On the first approach the plane was travelling too fast and on the second the automatic systems failed, Russian news agency Interfax said. Allow Instagram content?

The jet hit the tarmac three times and smashed its rear undercarriage, then debris got into an engine and set it ablaze, Interfax reported. The emergency landing reportedly happened shortly after take-off Investigators are trying to determine the cause of Sunday's crash The aircraft landed with full fuel tanks because the crew lost contact with air traffic controllers and decided it was too dangerous to dump fuel over Moscow, the agency added. The jet returned to the airport within 30 minutes of departing Aeroflotpublished a list of survivors,external(in Russian) who have been identified so far. Mr Chibis has reportedly said that the families of those killed in the fire will each receive one million rubles ($15,300; Â£11,630), while the victims being treated in hospital will be given 500,000 rubles ($7,650; Â£5,815). Ambulances lined up in front of the terminal building at Sheremetyevo airport Russia's emergency ministry said there were no plans to ground its Superjet-100 aircraft. Russian President Vladimir Putin has reportedly been briefed and expressed condolences to the families of victims. The region of Murmansk has announced a three-day mourning period. With millions of commercial flights taking place every year, lightning strikes in the air are relatively common. Traditional planes, built using aluminium, are usually able to withstand such strikes as the shell or ""skin"" of the aircraft acts as a cage, distributing the electricity without causing damage and allowing them to continue their journey safely. Some newer aircraft are constructed using lighter materials that have lower electrical conductivity, such as carbon fibre, which need to be protected - often using wire mesh or foil. A plane takes to the air as lightning strikes (stock photo) In addition, the electronics and connections to an aircraft's fuel tanks are heavily shielded to protect them from external electrical bursts. Lightning strikes can cause technical malfunctions, causing planes to divert or make emergency landings for precautionary reasons. But crashes following such incidents are rare. A strike is still likely to be noticed by people on board, though. Passengers may hear loud bangs or experience the cabin lighting up with a bright flash. The only previous fatal crash of a Sukhoi Superjet-100 was during a demonstration flight in Indonesia in 2012. The plane hit a mountainside, killing all 45 on board in a crash blamed on human error.

When she became a member of the Royal Family, she gave up her acting career - and immersed herself in the life of a working royal, using the platform to highlight the charities and causes close to her heart. She became a mother in May 2019 but within a year she and Prince Harry had stepped away as working members of the Royal Family and started a new life in North America. She and Prince Harry had their second child, Lilibet ""Lili"" Diana Mountbatten-Windsor, in June 2021. Born Rachel Meghan Markle on 4 August 1981, she grew up in a prosperous part of Los Angeles. Her mother's home is in an area known as the ""Black Beverly Hills"". Meghan went to a private primary school in Hollywood and started campaigning for gender equality at an early age. At 11, she wrote a letter to the then US first lady, Hillary Clinton, lamenting a washing-up liquid's TV ad strapline: ""Women all over America are fighting greasy pots and pans."" Meghan, Duchess of Sussex and Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex attend the Commonwealth Day service at Westminster Abbey in March 2019 Within a month, manufacturers Procter and Gamble had changed the word ""women"" to ""people"". ""It was at that moment that I realised the magnitude of my actions,"" she later said. ""I had created my small level of impact by standing up for equality."" At 15, she was volunteering in soup kitchens as her studies continued at a girls' Roman Catholic college, and she graduated from Northwestern University School of Communication, near Chicago, in 2003. A stint working as an intern at the US embassy in Argentina made her think her path might lead her into politics, but she changed course when her acting career began to take off. Between auditions, she has told of making money by doing calligraphy for wedding invitations, using skills developed in handwriting classes at school. Duchess of Sussex expecting a baby Meghan Markle's career in pictures How Meghan made her mark as a 'real deal' campaigner Five moments from Meghan's last Suits Her father was a cinematographer on the hit 1980s show Married... With Children, and her first television appearance in the US was in an episode of the medical drama General Hospital in 2002, before moving on to roles in CSI, Without a Trace and Castle. There were leading roles in TV movies such as When Sparks Fly and Dater's Handbook, and bit parts in Hollywood films including Get Him to the Greek, Remember Me and Horrible Bosses, and she was a ""briefcase girl"" on the US version of game show Deal or No Deal. This video can not be played Watch Meghan Markle in a US wedding drama She also appeared in the sci-fi series Fringe, playing FBI special agent Amy Jessup, but her most famous role was in Suits. Meghan was in the show from its launch in 2011, but was written out in the finale of the seventh series. Fittingly, perhaps, she left after her character got married. Allow Twitter content?

In real life, Meghan's union with Prince Harry wasn't her first marriage. In September 2011, she wed film producer Trevor Engelson, but the pair divorced two years later. In September,it was reported,externalthat her ex-husband was producing a new TV show based on a man's custody battle with his ex-wife who marries into the Royal Family. In 2014, she began writing about topics such as food, beauty, fashion and travel, as well as her own story, on her lifestyle website The Tig. Meghan said setting up the website was an attempt to ""reframe the beauty content to include think pieces about self-empowerment"" and feature dynamic, inspirational women. In one post, she explained: ""I've never wanted to be a lady who lunches - I've always wanted to be a woman who works."" The site also carried candid blogs she wrote on every birthday. On turning 33 in 2014, she wrote: ""My 20s were brutal - a constant battle with myself, judging my weight, my style, my desire to be as cool/as hip/as smart/as 'whatever' as everyone else."" Royal wedding: All you need to know Who will change - Meghan or the Royal Family? She also grew a large social network profile, with 1.9 million followers on Instagram and more than 350,000 on Twitter. But she shut The Tig in April 2017, and deleted her social accounts January 2018. Her media career has gone hand-in-hand with support for causes that are important to her. Meghan taught children to paint with watercolours on a 2016 visit to Rwanda as a global ambassador for World Vision She tackled the issue of the stigma around menstrual health inan article for Time magazine,externalin March 2017 and was a global ambassador forWorld Vision Canada,external, which campaigns for better education, food and healthcare for children around the world. As part of her role, the actress travelled to Rwanda for the charity's Clean Water Campaign. Meghan's commitment to gender equality has seen her work with the United Nations, and she received a standing ovation from an audience including UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon fora stirring speech on International Women's Day 2015,external. Commenting on how she combined acting with campaigning, she said: ""While my life shifts from refugee camps to red carpets, I choose them both because these worlds can, in fact, co-exist. And for me, they must."" She has written about her pride in her mixed racial heritage Meghan, whose father is white and mother is African-American, has also spoken about coming to terms with her racial identity. In anarticle for Elle magazine,external, she wrote: ""While my mixed heritage may have created a grey area surrounding my self-identification, keeping me with a foot on both sides of the fence, I have come to embrace that. ""To say who I am, to share where I'm from, to voice my pride in being a strong, confident mixed-race woman."" In late 2016, Prince Harry confirmed he was in relationship with Meghan -while issuing a statement accusing journalists of harassing her,external. The pair had met on a blind date, organised by a mutual friend. After just two dates, they went on holiday together to Botswana. In September 2017 Meghan told Vanity Fair magazine they were ""two people who are really happy and in love"". And in an interview that November,when their engagement was announced,Prince Harry admitted he had never heard of Meghan before his friend introduced them, and was ""beautifully surprised"". Meghan and Prince Harry got married at St George's Chapel, Windsor, on 19 May 2018. The Queen gave them the title of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex on their wedding day Thousands of members of the public turned out for the couple's wedding Meghan and Prince Harry embarked on their first royal tour together in October 2018 - visiting Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Tonga over 16 days. The trip coincided with the coupleannouncing they were expecting their first baby. Meghan at the British High Commissioner's Residence in Suva, Fiji The duke and duchess followed in the footsteps of Prince Harry's parents - Prince Charles and Diana, Princess of Wales - whose first royal tour was to Australia and New Zealand. Harry and Meghan at Taronga Zoo in Sydney Meghan and Prince Harry at the unveiling of the Labalaba Statue in Nadi, Fiji In February 2019 the Duke and Duchess travelled to Morocco for a three-day visit In September 2019, the couple undertook a 10-day tour of Africa, a continent that has always been particularly dear to Prince Harry's heart, leading to some speculation early in their marriage that they might at some stage choose to live there. Meghan met Archbishop Desmond Tutu and Sophia Williams-De Bruyn, as well as other key figures in South Africa's anti-apartheid movement. Sophia Williams-De Bruyn was aged 18 when she helped lead about 20,000 protesters Prince Harry and Meghan met Nelson Mandela's widow, Graca Machel, at a reception in Johannesburg She also made a speech to business people in Johannesburg in which she said such entrepreneurs had the power to change a world that seems ""aggressive, confrontational and dangerous"". But by the end of the tour, the couple's talk about fighting injustice was being reported alongside newsthat they were beginning legal action against the Mail on Sundayfor publishing a private letter sent by the Duchess of Sussex to her father. This video can not be played Harry and Meghan's royal engagements When Meghan gave birth to her son Archie Harrison - on 6 May 2019 - the reaction from the New York Times reflected the mass interest in the event around the world as it wrote: ""He is the first multiracial baby in the British monarchy's recent history, an instant star in a country where multiracial children make up the fastest-growing ethnic category."" But the royal couple had already decided to do things a little differently, underlining their determination not to follow the traditions of other recent royal births. In advance, they chose not to reveal where the baby would be born and said there would be no running commentary of what was happening, instantly stopping the spectacle of the press pack joining the ranks of ""royal superfans"" camped outside a hospital for several days waiting for the first glimpse of the new royal. And the birth wasn't initially announced in the traditional royal way of  being posted on a placard outside Buckingham Palace. Instead, Prince Harry popped out of their home to tell the world (although the placard then followed). The very private christening that followed just added to some media frustration that they could not, in their minds, fully report on one of the year's happiest stories. Held at Windsor Castle, the ceremony was not witnessed by any press photographers or TV cameras and the list of guests and godparents was not made public. BBC royal correspondent Jonny Dymond surmised: ""It all points to a very different royal event, part of the continuing desire by the duke and duchess to raise their son Archie out of the spotlight."" Now you see them.... ...now you don't. Madame Tussauds removed Harry and Meghan from its royal set, leaving an empty space Amid ongoing spats with the media, increasingly through lawyers, it would soon become clear that both Meghan and her husband were becoming increasingly disenchanted with the expectations that came with their royal role. The announcement in June 2019 that they were breaking away from the Royal Foundation charity - which had seen them work closely with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge - led to frenzied speculation about Prince Harry and Meghan's relationship with Prince William and Catherine. The cost to taxpayers of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's UK home at Frogmore Cottage reopened the debate about how the Royal Family is funded Then there was the revelation that their home, Frogmore Cottage,had been renovated with Â£2.4m of taxpayer-funded costs.It waslater announced that Prince Harry had paid back the cost. Meghan's comments during the couple's African tour that she had not felt supported as she struggled with motherhood and her new role did not go down well with senior royals, according to sources at the time. At the end of 2019, the couple took an extended Christmas break from royal duties, taking Archie to the Canadian province of British Columbia. The couple and their son Archie spent time in Canada over Christmas 2019 It gave them time to mull over their next move and, within days of the start of a new decade, they dropped the bombshell announcement that they planned to step back as senior royals and become financially independent. Amid the further detail that the couple planned to split their time between the UK and North America, Buckingham Palace expressed its disappointment aspalace sources revealed that that no other royal - including the Queen or Prince William - was consultedbefore the statement was issued. The couple's final engagement as working royals saw them in the familiar surroundings of Westminster Abbey Talks then ensued between Prince Harry and the Queento iron out the detailsbefore it was confirmed that their couple's final duties as working members of the Royal Family would be in March 2020. The very final engagement saw them attend the Commonwealth Day service at Westminster Abbey. The Queen, Prince Charles and Prince William were all there although one of the abiding memories of Meghan's royal exit - by now widely renamed ""Megxit"" - was getting a hug from singer Craig David. Prince Harry bumped forearms with Craig David when they met at the end of the service - while Meghan opted to hug him In February 2021, before a formal review of the situation had begun,Buckingham Palace confirmed the Duke and Duchess of Sussex would not be returningas working members of the Royal Family. It meant Prince Harry and Meghan would return their honorary military appointments and royal patronages, which will be redistributed to working members of the Royal Family. The couple will still attend some royal events in the future but these will not be classed as official duties. After time was spent in Canada, the couple settled at a new home in California. It has allowed them to spend much more time with Meghan's mother Doria Ragland, who lives in the state. But they are never completely out of the spotlight. There was a media fascination in tracking the couple's whereabouts in the early days of the coronavirus lockdown. In April 2020, they sued and eventually won an apology from a US news agency after drones were allegedly used to take pictures of their son, Archie, at their home. The same month, the couple announced that they were ending all co-operation with four tabloid newspaper groups in the UK, blaming ""distorted, false or invasive"" stories. But they do remain keen to seek publicity for the causes or issues they are interested in. As a duchess, Meghan took on portfolio of charitable work and patronages, which included the National Theatre and charity Smart Works. She also launched a charity cookbook in September 2018 to help those affected by the Grenfell Tower fire. Meghan was joined be her mother, Doria Ragland, and Prince Harry for the cookbook launch After moving back to the US, she jointly wrote a newspaper article calling for the end of ""structural racism"" and the couple also urged US citizens to vote in the presidential election, saying that they should""reject hate"". In November 2020, Meghanwrote an article,externalrevealing her ""almost unbearable grief"" at enduring a miscarriage in July of that year. As for their future career plans, a big clue came when theyreached a deal with streaming giant Netflixto make a range of programmes, some of which they may appear in. Meghan and Prince Harry featured in a succession of headlines in February 2021. At the High Court in London,Meghan won her claim for misuse of private informationagainst the publisher of the Mail on Sunday and MailOnline, over the publication of extracts from a letter to her father.  A further hearing will decide the ""next steps"" in her legal action which covers claims of copyright infringement and breach of the Data Protection Act. Days laterMeghan and Prince Harry announced they were expecting their second child. Then came the news the couple had decided to talk about their decision to step away from the monarchy, in a TV interview with Oprah Winfrey. And there was a statement fromBuckingham Palace that it would investigate claims the Duchess of Sussex bullied royal staffin 2018. Her spokesman said the duchess was ""saddened"" by the ""latest attack on her character"" - and the following day a clip from her Winfrey interview was issued by CBS in whichMeghan said Buckingham Palace could not expect her and Prince Harry to be silentif it was ""perpetuating falsehoods about us"". In June, Meghanhad her first daughter, Lilibet ""Lili"" Diana Mountbatten-Windsor, and she and Prince Harry said Lili ""is more than we could have ever imagined"". The couple named their second child Lilibet after the Royal Family's nickname for the Queen, the baby's great-grandmother. And her middle name, Diana, was chosen to honour her ""beloved late grandmother"", the Princess of Wales, they said.

Humans 'threaten 1m species with extinction'A compelling UN assessment shows the full picture of humanity's devastating impact on biodiversity and nature.,"Pollination is vital for food production On land, in the seas, in the sky, the devastating impact of humans on nature is laid bare in a compelling UN report. One million animal and plant species are now threatened with extinction. Nature everywhere is declining at a speed never previously seen and our need for ever more food and energy are the main drivers. These trends can be halted, the study says, but it will take ""transformative change"" in every aspect of how humans interact with nature. Five things we've learned from nature crisis study Nature's emergency in five graphics The teens saving Madagascar's wildlife What would a world without humans be like? From the bees that pollinate our crops, to the forests that hold back flood waters, the report reveals how humans are ravaging the very ecosystems that support their societies. Three years in the making, this global assessment of nature draws on 15,000 reference materials, and has been compiled by the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES). It runs to 1,800 pages. The brief, 40-page ""summary for policymakers"", published today at a meeting in Paris, is perhaps the most powerful indictment of how humans have treated their only home. It says that while the Earth has always suffered from the actions of humans through history, over the past 50 years, these scratches have become deep scars. The world's population has doubled since 1970, the global economy has grown four-fold, while international trade has increased 10 times over. To feed, clothe and give energy to this burgeoning world, forests have been cleared at astonishing rates, especially in tropical areas. Between 1980 and 2000, 100 million hectares of tropical forest were lost, mainly from cattle ranching in South America and palm oil plantations in South East Asia. Faring worse than forests are wetlands, with only 13% of those present in 1700 still in existence in the year 2000. Our cities have expanded rapidly, with urban areas doubling since 1992. This video can not be played ""Species are going extinct at a faster rate than we've seen for millions of years"" - Laura Foster reports All this human activity is killing species in greater numbers than ever before. According to the global assessment, an average of around 25% of animals and plants are now threatened. Global trends in insect populations are not known but rapid declines in some locations have also been well documented. All this suggests around a million species now face extinction within decades, a rate of destruction tens to hundreds of times higher than the average over the past 10 million years. ""We have documented a really unprecedented decline in biodiversity and nature, this is completely different than anything we've seen in human history in terms of the rate of decline and the scale of the threat,"" said Dr Kate Brauman, from the University of Minnesota and a co-ordinating lead author of the assessment. ""When we laid it all out together I was just shocked to see how extreme the declines are in terms of species and in terms of the contributions that nature is providing to people."" The assessment also finds that soils are being degraded as never before. This has reduced the productivity of 23% of the land surface of the Earth. Our insatiable appetites are producing a mountain of waste. Plastic pollution has increased ten-fold since 1980. Every year we dump 300-400 million tonnes of heavy metals, solvents, toxic sludge and other wastes into the waters of the world. The report's authors say there are a number of direct drivers of which land use change is the primary one. This essentially means the replacement of grassland with intensive crops, or replacing ancient woodland with a plantation forest, or the clearing of forests to grow crops. This is happening in many parts of the world, especially in the tropics. Since 1980, more than half of the increase in agriculture has been at the expense of intact forests. It's a similar story at sea. Only 3% of the world's oceans were described as free from human pressure in 2014. Fish are being exploited as never before, with 33% of fish stocks harvested at unsustainable levels in 2015. Many fish species are in decline through overfishing, the study says Live coral cover on reefs has nearly halved over the past 150 years. Pushing all this forward, though, are increased demands for food from a growing global population and specifically our growing appetite for meat and fish. ""Land use now appears as the major driver of the biodiversity collapse, with 70% of agriculture related to meat production,"" said Yann Laurans from IDDRI, the French policy research institute. ""It is time to reconsider the share of industrial meat and dairy in our diet."" The other key factors are the hunting and the direct exploitation of animals, climate change, pollution and invasive species. The report finds that many of these factors work together to make matters worse. At the report's launch, Kai Chan, a co-ordinating lead author from the University of British Columbia, Vancouver, said: ""No previous assessment has considered at this scale the simultaneous challenge of protecting nature, maintaining water, feeding the planet, supplying energy, while mitigating climate change... this is the most exhaustive report to have ever done that."" Species extinction risk:Approximately 25% of species are already threatened with extinction in most animal and plant groups studied. Natural ecosystems:Natural ecosystems have declined by 47% on average, relative to their earliest estimated states. Biomass and species abundance:The global biomass of wild mammals has fallen by 82%. Indicators of vertebrate abundance have declined rapidly since 1970. Nature for indigenous people:72% of indicators developed by local communities show ongoing deterioration of elements of nature important to them. It all depends on what we do. Researchers say the loss of nature will have major implications for humans The authors looked at a number of scenarios for the future, including business-as-usual, but also examining options that were more based on sustainable practices. In almost all cases, the negative trends for nature will continue to 2050 and beyond. The only ones that didn't continue towards ecological disaster involved what the scientists term ""transformative change"". The study doesn't tell governments what to do, but gives them some pretty strong hints. One big idea is to steer the world away from the ""limited paradigm of economic growth"". They suggest moving away from GDP as a key measure of economic wealth and instead adopting more holistic approaches that would capture quality of life and long-term effects. They argue that our traditional notion of a ""good quality of life"" has involved increasing consumption on every level. This has to change. Threat to food as biodiversity declines To keep carbon emissions down, look underfoot Dogs 'becoming major threat' to wildlife Insect decline may see 'plague of pests' Similarly, there must be change when it comes to financial incentives that damage biodiversity. ""Crucially, governments must end the destructive subsidies, including for fossil fuels and industrial fishing and agriculture,"" said Andrew Norton, director of the International Institute for Environment and Development. ""These drive the plundering of the land and ocean at the expense of a clean, healthy and diverse environment on which billions of women, children and men depend now and in the future."" The amount of land and sea that is under protection needs to increase rapidly, with observers saying that a third of our lands need to be preserved. ""We need to secure half of the planet by 2050 with an interim target of 30% by 2030,"" said Jonathan Baillie, from the National Geographic Society. ""Then we must restore nature and drive innovation. Only then will we leave future generations a healthy and sustainable planet."" Climate change is a crucial underlying factor that's helping to drive destruction around the world. Greenhouse gas emissions have doubled since 1980 and temperatures have gone up 0.7C as a result. This is having a big impact on some species, restricting their ranges and making extinction more likely. The global assessment finds that if temperatures go up by 2C, then 5% of species are at risk of climate-driven extinction, rising to 16% if the world warms by 4.3C. ""Of the prioritised list of proximate drivers of biodiversity decline, climate change is only number three,"" said Prof John Spicer from the University of Plymouth. ""Climate change is certainly one of the greatest threats that face humankind in the near future - so what does that tell us about the first and second, changes in land/sea use, and direct exploitation? The current situation is desperate and has been for some time."" The report's authors hope that their assessment becomes as critical to the argument about biodiversity loss as the IPCC report on 1.5C has done to the debate over climate change. The idea of transformative action is not just confined to governments or local authorities. Individuals can certainly make a difference. ""We know that the way people eat today is often unhealthy for them and for the planet,"" said Dr Kate Brauman, one of the report's authors. ""We can become healthier as individuals by eating more diverse diets, with more vegetables, and we can also make the planet healthier by growing that food in more sustainable ways."" As well as consumer and lifestyle choices, other authors believe people can make a difference through politics. ""It might be more important for society to invest more in renewables than coal,"" said Dr Rinku Roy Chowdhury, from Clark University in Worcester, Massachusetts. ""So how do you that? Through individual behaviour, through the polling booth. ""Rather than just conserving energy by turning my lights off, some other less obvious means might be through political action.""

The global assessment finds that if temperatures go up by 2C, then 5% of species are at risk of climate-driven extinction, rising to 16% if the world warms by 4.3C. ""Of the prioritised list of proximate drivers of biodiversity decline, climate change is only number three,"" said Prof John Spicer from the University of Plymouth. ""Climate change is certainly one of the greatest threats that face humankind in the near future - so what does that tell us about the first and second, changes in land/sea use, and direct exploitation? The current situation is desperate and has been for some time."" The report's authors hope that their assessment becomes as critical to the argument about biodiversity loss as the IPCC report on 1.5C has done to the debate over climate change. The idea of transformative action is not just confined to governments or local authorities. Individuals can certainly make a difference. ""We know that the way people eat today is often unhealthy for them and for the planet,"" said Dr Kate Brauman, one of the report's authors. ""We can become healthier as individuals by eating more diverse diets, with more vegetables, and we can also make the planet healthier by growing that food in more sustainable ways."" As well as consumer and lifestyle choices, other authors believe people can make a difference through politics. ""It might be more important for society to invest more in renewables than coal,"" said Dr Rinku Roy Chowdhury, from Clark University in Worcester, Massachusetts. ""So how do you that? Through individual behaviour, through the polling booth. ""Rather than just conserving energy by turning my lights off, some other less obvious means might be through political action.""

Walking on the edge of hidden islands,"Islandeering shares the same psychology as climbing to the summit of a mountain, according to Lisa Drewe, the woman who invented the term. She says: ""People never really start out with the aim of just going half way up a mountain."" And for Lisa, the same ""completist"" urge applies to islands as well. Lisa Drewe has been islandeering on 130 of Britain's ""hidden"" islands Islandeering is making a circular journey around the outer edge of an island by any means possible - walking, scrambling or paddling, Lisa says. So far she has been islandeering on 130 of Britain's ""hidden"" islands. Lisa got to Taransay by sea kayak but other islands are more accessible Taransay was the island used in the reality show Castaway that made a star out of Ben Fogle She calls them ""hidden"" because, by looking for islands she can get to and get around in a day, she has uncovered some amazing places not many people know about. Bothy-bagging: Scotland's best-kept secrets revealed The routes she takes have a start and finish but in-between Lisa is often following animal tracks and trying to avoid cliffs, the incoming tide or boggy areas. She says the urge is to see the island from all sides, ""just because it is there"". ""I just feel that completing the circle and knowing the island as a whole is important to me, rather than daytripping and going to see something specific,"" she says. ""It just seems to be something more of a complete journey rather like getting to the top of a mountain and coming back down again."" Lisa,who runs a website called Islandeering.com,external, says she started out searching for ""incredible wilderness and nature"" but the longer she has been doing the project, the more she has enjoyed chance meetings with people along the way. North Ronaldsay is the northernmost island in the Orkney archipelago ""That's a big tick for me,"" she says. ""I often meet the postladies or postmen, sometimes they are the only people I see, even on an inhabited island."" Lisa says she like chance meeting with locals such as the postwoman on Flotta There is also the adventure and the discovery, she says. ""Chancing across ruins that I didn't expect to be there, something that hasn't been written about before, something that I can bring back and share with others. ""For a lot of the islands there is no information at all about the island, let alone whether you can get around the outside edge."" Islands can throw up surprises such as this World War Two artillery on Flotta She says people have been urging her to share the information on her trips so she has put 50 of them in a new book - Islandeering: Adventures around the edge of Britain's Hidden Islands. Oronsay is joined to Skye by a tidal causeway Lisa has a home on Skye, one of Scotland's most famous islands, which is popular with tourists from around the world. Millions visit Skye each year but very few have been out to the island of Oronsay, a tidal island in Loch Bracadale which is linked to the west coast of Skye by a causeway. Lisa says it is possible to cross most of the time but care is needed as it is covered for a few hours either side of high tide. Once on the island, the free-range route along grassy cliff edges provides plenty of opportunity to explore the ""impressive"" sea caves and gullies, Lisa says. And a short, sharp climb gives views ""like no other"". Lisa says: ""You can see the Black Cuillin, you can see all the way to the north to the Old Man of Storr, you can see the Outer Hebrides and I can't think of another viewpoint like that."" Holy Island lies off Arran Another small island hiding off the coast of a popular island is Holy Island, off Arran. Lisa says: ""It is an absolutely incredible place. ""It is very highly accessible and it was a complete surprise to me because it is a Buddhist community living among white stupas and prayer flags and according to the five golden rules of Buddhism. ""It is off the coast of Arran, you can look back and see the towering mountains of Arran. ""I don't think you'd get that perspective from anywhere else. That's a very quirky island and it's a very peaceful, tranquil place to go and it's not that far away."" Davaar is another island accessed by a 30-minute walk across a tidal sand and pebble causeway. It lies just off Campbeltown on the Kintyre peninsula, with views to Arran in the north east and the Ayrshire coast to the south. The island has a permanently occupied lighthouse and a few holiday lets but is otherwise sparsely populated. One of its more unusual attractions is a sea cave with a painting of the Crucifixion inside. The painting was discovered in 1887 by a local fisherman and frenzied speculation ensued about how it had got there. The mystery artist, local art teacher Archibald MacKinnon, kept his secret for 47 years before revealing he was behind it. Eilean Shona lies in Loch Moidart Eilean Shona, which nestles in the entrance to Loch Moidart on the west coast of Scotland, is a ""magical place"", according to Lisa Drewe. Peter Pan writer JM Barrie used the island as a summer holiday retreat for himself and his foster sons in the 1920s and it is thought it was here that he wrote a screenplay for the 1924 film adaptation of his famous work. ""You can almost feel some of those mythical characters moving around in the woods,"" Lisa says. The island is now owned by Vanessa Branson, sister of billionaire entrepreneur Richard Branson. Lisa says that, once on the island, you immediately sense that island is being cared for. The ""unspoilt"" island has a permanent population of two but there are some restored cottage for visitors. In the Orkney archipelago, the island of Hoy is popular with tourists but few make it to South Walls, which is joined to it by a causeway built on top of sandbanks. The island's small population is concentrated at Longhope, with a scattering of houses in the low-lying north. The south of the island is wild and remote, Lisa says, with some ""incredible geological features"". She says the huge, collapsed sea caves, called gloups, are spectacular. ""When you look down them you get vertigo and at the bottom you can hear the sea sucking and gurgling below,"" she says. Lisa says: ""During high seas they become magnificent blowholes and seeing spray blasted out of their tops is quite a surreal experience when walking towards them on the cliff.""

"Line of Duty draws year's biggest audienceMore than nine million tune into a final episode critics call ""deeply satisfying"" and ""breathtaking"".Entertainment & Arts","L to R: Line of Duty stars Vicky McClure, Adrian Dunbar and Martin Compston More than nine million viewers tuned into the final episode of Line of Duty on Sunday, giving it the biggest overnight audience of 2019 so far. The tense conclusion to the BBC One drama's fifth series attracted an average audience of 9.1 million, according to overnight figures. Charlotte Moore, the BBC's director of content, said it was ""fantastic to see such a big audience"" for the show. Critics said the episode was ""breathtaking"" and ""deeply satisfying"". Yet some expressed reservations about the series as a whole, saying it has been ""lacklustre"" and the ""weakest"" to date. The BBC has already commissioned a sixth series from writer Jed Mercurio, who also wrote Bodyguard. Line of Duty's figures are the highest for a drama since last year's Bodyguard finale, which drewan overnight audience of 10.4 millionlast September. ITV's royal drama Victoria, which went out at the same time as Line of Duty on Sunday, attracted an average audience of 2.5 million. Do not read on if you do not want to know anything else about Line of Duty's final episode. Viewers on Sunday saw Ted Hastings (Adrian Dunbar), head of anti-corruption unit AC-12, interrogated at length by his superior Patricia Carmichael (Anna Maxwell Martin). The result,said the Telegraph's Allison Pearson,external, was ""an extraordinarily tense scene, a remarkable piece of theatre and one of the best things anyone will see this year on a TV screen."" The Times' Carol Midgley,externalsaid the scene was ""forensically written and beautifully executed"", while Jan Moir from the Daily Mail called it ""beautifully scripted,external"". Moir also praised a ""killer twist"" at the conclusion of a ""nerve-shredding"" episode that kept audiences ""guessing right until almost the end."" Anna Maxwell Martin returned as Patricia Carmichael in Sunday's episode ""The latest twist was a classic Line of Duty curveball,""wrote the Mirror's Ian Hyland,external- albeit one that ""stretched credibility to breaking point."" The Guardian's Lucy Mangan said it was ""as deeply satisfying as any in AC-12's history"" but said the series as a whole had ""felt like a placeholder season,external"". ""The twists are getting dafter but Line of Duty remains crazily compelling,"" wrote Mike Wardin the Express,external. The Independent's Ed Power, meanwhile, said the ""exceedingly talky,external"" episode ""wrap[ped] up most of its loose ends... with excessive leisureliness."" Twitter users have also had much to say about the episode, with praise being shared between the writing and its actors. ""The writing talent and sheer ballsy confidence of Jed Mercurio is breathtaking,""wrote broadcaster Muriel Gray,external, going on to salute the ""outstanding"" cast. The BBC's Dan Walker was particularly impressed by one scene featuring actors Vicky McClure and Martin Compston. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The British Transport Police also got in on the action, insisting its recruitment processes were ""much better,external"" than the ones depicted in the show. In her own Twitter post,external, McClure gave ""a huge thank you to the LOD family for making this such a special series."" ""Behind every good cast there's a phenomenal crew,""wrote Compston,external. ""To make this show really is a team effort."" The credits for the 85-minute episode ended with a tribute to Graeme Livingstone, a crew member who died in a motorcycle accident in 2017. The first episode of this series of Line of Dutydrew an overnight audience of 7.8 million viewerswhen it aired at the end of March. That figure rose to almost 11 million once the number of people who watched the show on devices was taken into account.

Teens save Madagascar wildlife,"Nantenaina, 15, is one of the young farmers working to save the forest and to make a living The island nation of Madagascar has a dubious accolade: it is the world-leader in deforestation. Now, some of the island's teenagers have started a farming revolution - working to stop food production from destroying the island's rich rainforest. The bridge across the river to Mangabe has collapsed. Probably many years ago. Just a few wooden stumps now protrude from the murky water separating densely forested riverbanks. The only way across is on an unnervingly wobbly canoe. We crouch low - backpacks at our feet - gripping the sides of that canoe as it is expertly steered across the water. We are less than 100 miles from the capital of Madagascar, Antananarivo, but this is a stark reminder of just how remote the communities of this protected area are. When we have crossed the river, it is still a two-hour walk to Mangabe village. We're going there to meet a group of Malagasy teenagers - young famers who are leading a small but vital revolution - transforming how people farm in order to save their forest. Nature loss: Major report to highlight natural and human emergency Sold for a song: The rare birds captured for their tuneful voices Lemur extinction: Vast majority of species under threat This video can not be played Madagascar's forests are home to 100 species of lemur found nowhere else on the planet Almost 9,000km away in Paris, at a glossy, international gathering, scientists and politicians are finalising an assessment on humanity's relationship with nature. With its somewhat ungainly title, theIntergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services,external(IPBES) will publish a seminal upsum of the ecological emergency our planet is facing; humanity's impact on the natural world. There is little doubt that, worldwide, humanity struggles to coexist with other species that inhabit the planet - even some that we are keenly aware that we need. Biodiversity encompasses pollinating insects we rely on for food, trees and plants that provide clean air and water and the network of life underfoot that keeps soil fertile and productive. It is the network of life - we depend on it. The global report due on 6 May has the lofty goal of setting out a path to a more sustainable future. But here in Mangabe, communities live alongside one of the richest, most diverse rainforests in the world. They make their livelihoods entirely through farming; here the link between people and the forest is palpable and inextricable. A forest guide holds a chameleon in Mangabe forest ""If the forest is lost, many things will be lost,"" explains Voahirana Randriamamonjy from the Malagasy conservation organisationMadagasikara Voakajy,external. The diminutive, unstoppably optimistic conservationist has been working with the young people of Mangabe's communities for the last three years. ""It's not just about the wildlife. Without the forest, there will be no clean water for people to drink, the soil will lose its fertility and be eroded away,"" he says. ""The forest even provides medicine,"" she adds. ""It takes hours to walk to a doctor from these villages, so people rely on natural remedies that grow here."" Local communities depend entirely on the land and what they can grow As well as being our hosts and guides, Voahirana and her team are here to meet with and to train the teenage recruits as part of their ""Youth for Lemurs"" project. This community-based mission sets out to provide the new generation of farmers with the skills, knowledge and tools to be able to grow their food without destroying the forest. Conservationist Voahirana Randriamamonjy Traditionally, Voahirana explains, forest destruction and farming go hand in hand. ""The old method is often called  'slash and burn' - cutting down a patch of forest and setting fire to it. Ash makes a good fertiliser."" But when the nutrients in the ash are used up, that cycle of slash and burn starts again. ""It causes a great deal of deforestation here in Madagascar,"" says Voahirana. That has contributed to a dubious accolade; Madagascar is the world-leader in deforestation. In 2017 alone, 500,000 hectares were cut down - half a million football pitches of rich, diverse rainforest. Gone. The situation has become so dire that a group of Malagasy and international scientists have come together to urge the new government here to take steps to preserve the country's famous biodiversity. The rice harvest is a task for the whole community in Mangabe ""Madagascar's irreplaceable forests are burning and there are species threatened by the pet trade which will go extinct in the next few years if things don't change,"" explains Prof Julia Jones from Bangor University, UK, who ledthat study,external. ""The link to human well-being is often less clear for biodiversity loss than it is for climate change, but effective conservation is essential. If Madagascar lost its lemurs, its forests, its coral reefs, it would be so much poorer."" It is that pattern of destruction that the young people of Mangabe are now working to break away from. Mangabe forest is officially protected. But looking over its landscape, you can see where farms have bitten chunks out of irreplaceable habitat. Where it is intact, under the shade of its dense canopy, there is a palpable sense of what a biodiversity hotspot it is. Vines wrap around trees that are surrounded by leafy plants buzzing with insects. As we follow our guides along the path to the village, a nearby tree shakes - an indri lemur bounds quickly away from us. When one of our guides, Emille, gently flicks over one particular leaf, a minuscule, bright orange frog is sheltering beneath. Even small-scale farming drives deforestation, but people need space to grow their food It is a golden mantella - a critically endangered amphibian that - like so many species here - lives only in Madagascar. ""This forest is unique - it's a very special place,"" says Voahirana. Golden mantella frogs are critically endangered On our first morning in Mangabe village there is a buzz of activity. The community is planning a meeting to welcome the visitors and to launch a new season for the Youth for Lemurs project. The charity - Madagasikara Voakajy - will recruit and train a new group of young volunteers in 10 villages around the forest; this year, they are starting in Mangabe. Voahirana, her colleague Harifefitra and the rest of the team will provide the dozen or so new recruits with tools and seeds, as well as the new skills and knowledge. ""They tell us what they want to grow and we give them the training,"" explains Harifefitra. On an experimental plot, the young farmers can try out new crops That training consists of how to make compost as a fertiliser and how to rotate the crops you grow to produce a better yield. These modern farming techniques may not appear revolutionary, but they provide life-changing benefits. They enable the same plot to be farmed each season, eliminating the need to move into the forest. And they produce higher yields. The village has an experimental plot where the the teenagers practise their skills and try growing new crops. Rows of sweet potatoes are flourishing and there are papaya and lychee trees at each end. When we visit in the morning, this year's volunteers are busily weeding and pruning the fruit trees. Voahirana demonstrates the right branches to snip. Nantenaina is weeding around the papaya tree. At 15-years-old, her pensive expression gives her an air of worry that makes her seem older than her years. But when she talks about what she has learned, she is positively glowing. Mangabe forest is now a protected area - one of the pockets of Malagasy rainforest still intact ""I feel very happy,"" she says. ""By planting just a small surface of land, I can produce high yield. And if we can do this it means people will not cut and clear the forest. ""We have a beautiful forest in Mangabe - that's why I became involved in this project."" Her friend, Omega - a gangly, smiling 16-year old boy - shows off his knowledge of just how valuable the forest is. Omega is one of the Youth for Lemurs volunteers ""It provides the fresh air we breathe and helps the livelihoods of the local people,"" he explains. ""If it continued to be destroyed, there would be less water to drink. There would be a loss of habitat for wildlife in the forest, such as the lemurs - they would disappear. They would all die."" Nantenaina says that, since the project started three years ago, older villagers have started coming to the young pioneers for advice about their methods - wanting to understand how they achieve their higher yields. ""The future of the forest, says Voahirana, ""depends on these young people"". ""They have these new skills, which they can teach to their kids. So the next generation will be able to farm sustainably."" As Madagascar's recently elected president, Andry Rajoelina, begins a five-year term of office, scientists and conservationists who have spent decades studying and protecting Madagascar's natural habitats hope that this will be a turning point. They say this is the last chance to prevent habitats and species unique to this island nation from being lost forever. ""In a place like Madagascar conservation has to be very careful to ensure that it doesn't have a negative impact on poor rural communities whose livelihoods depend on using natural resources,"" Prof Jones stresses. ""It has to be about people and about tenure. People at the forest frontier need to have their rights to agricultural land respected. ""If you had an allotment and you're told you only have it for one year, you're not going to invest in its future - improve the soil and put in fruit trees or asparagus plants. You might just grow a few lettuces you could eat that year."" Professor Jonah Ratsimbazafy, from the University of Antananarivo and one of the paper's co-authors, added: ""The United States have the Statue of Liberty, France has the Eiffel towerâ¦. For us in Madagascar, it is our biodiversity - the product of millions of years of evolution. ""It is the unique heritage we are known for around the world. We cannot let these natural wonders, including 100 different types of lemur found nowhere else, disappear"". But however much people want to protect the forest, adds Prof Jones, ""they need to be able to feed their families. Shifting towards more productive forms of agriculture can be beneficial for people and for the environment."" But as much as the teenagers of Mangabe are working hard to save their forest, the youngest, poorest people simply do not have the power and resources to drive change in Madagascar. ""If people want a world in which lemurs [live], people in richer countries may well need to be willing to help cover some of the costs of protecting that forest,"" says Prof Jones. ""This involves supporting organisations such as Madagasikara Voakajy to do what they do. ""They work on a shoe-string, protecting some of the most threatened species on the planet by working with some of the poorest people on the planet. I personally feel they deserve our support."" Dore now supplements his income by working as a forest guide and ranger with the charity On the morning that we leave Mangabe village and head back through the forest towards the river and that wobbly canoe - we hear indri call. It is a haunting song that seems to fill the entire valley. ""We're very proud that the indri live here,"" says our guide, Dore. He is Mamtemaima's father and he was born and raised in Mangabe. ""They are like a clock for the local people - they know what time it is when they hear them sing. ""In other places, the forests are being cut down, he adds. ""But not here. Here we preserve the forest because it gives us so many things that improve our lives. We're so proud of the rainforest.""

Shares hit by Trump tariff threat to China,"US trade representative Robert Lighthizer spoke of an ""erosion"" of commitments US trade representative Robert Lighthizer has accused China of backtracking on commitments in trade talks, but insisted a deal on tariffs is still possible. He said President Trump's threat to impose new taxes on Chinese exports came after China reneged on promises. But he said a Chinese delegation was still expected in Washington on Thursday for a further round of talks. US stocks regained ground after sharp falls earlier. US-China trade war in 300 words US and China agree to suspend new tariffs The next US-China battleground On Sunday Mr Trump said on Twitter the US would more than double tariffs on $200bn (Â£152bn) of Chinese goods on Friday and could introduce fresh tariffs. Speaking to reporters on Monday, Mr Lighthizer said: ""Over the course of the last week or so we have seen an erosion in commitments by China. That in our view is unacceptable."" He said China had tried to substantively change the text of an agreement between the countries as it was nearing its final stages. ""We're not breaking off talks at this point. But for now... come Friday there will be tariffs in place,"" Mr Lighthizer said. Earlier, world stock markets sank following the president's tweets, with the Shanghai Composite tumbling 5.6%. However in the US the Dow Jones closed down just 0.3%, having slumped 471 points - almost 1.8% - in early trading. China's top trade official Liu He will is still expected to return to Washington this week On Sunday the US president tweeted that tariffs of 10% on certain goods would rise to 25% on Friday, and $325bn of untaxed goods could face 25% duties ""shortly"". ""The Trade Deal with China continues, but too slowly, as they attempt to renegotiate. No!"" he tweeted. He followed that on Monday by tweeting that the US had been ""losing"" $500bn a year on trade with China. ""Sorry, we're not going to be doing that anymore!"" his tweet said. After imposing duties on billions of dollars worth of one another's goods last year, the US and China have been negotiating and in recent weeks, appeared to be close to striking a deal. Last week US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin described talks held in Beijing as ""productive"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

But according to reports, in recent days US officials have become frustrated by China's refusal to change its laws as part of the deal - something that had previously been agreed. Other sticking points have included how to enforce a deal, whether and how fast to roll back tariffs already imposed and issues around intellectual property protection. On Monday, US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told reporters that the negotiations were 90% complete but that Chinese negotiators were trying to ""go back on language that had been previously negotiated"". ""[This was] very clear language, that had the potential of changing the deal dramatically,"" he said. So far, the US has imposed tariffs on $250bn of Chinese goods, having accused the country of unfair trade practices. Beijing hit back with duties on $110bn of US goods, blaming the US for starting ""the largest trade war in economic history"". The US is the biggest export market for Chinese goods However, some analysts have questioned whether Mr Trump's threats are a negotiating tactic. William Reinsch, trade policy expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said China would never meet all the US demands. ""At some point the president is going to figure out that they're not going to give him everything he wants,"" he told news agency AFP. That will put Mr Trump in ""a precarious political position"" whether ""to accept an agreement that will be criticised as weak, or not to have an agreement and be criticised for failing"". Mr Trump's latest move will raise duties on more than 5,000 products made by Chinese producers, ranging from chemicals to textiles and consumer goods. The US president originally imposed a 10% tariff on these goods in September that was due to rise in January, but postponed this as negotiations advanced. Fears about a further escalation caused a slump in world stock markets towards the end of last year. The IMF has warned a full-blown trade war wouldweaken the global economy.

Clinical waste collection costs double,"The cost of collecting hospital medical waste in Scotland has more than doubled since the collapse of Healthcare Environmental Services, figures show. The Lanarkshire-based company went to the wall after becoming embroiled in awaste stockpiling scandal. Contingency measures to remove waste from every hospital, GP surgery, dental practice and pharmacy in Scotland were put in place. But this has resulted in a ""significant increased cost"". Contractors are receiving more than Â£460,000 per week to dispose of the hazardous materials following the collapse of Healthcare Environmental Services (HES), according to a Freedom of Information request made by the Press Association. But Garry Pettigrew, the ex-boss of HES,which went into liquidationfour months after all of its staff were made redundant, has claimed his firm charged a maximum of Â£11m per year - about Â£211,500 per week - for the collections. Lawyers acting for the former HES workers believe they could be owed more than Â£1m in lost wages and overtime The Scottish government said the contingency measures in place were robust and ""ensure that the environment and human health are appropriately protected"". However, leading bacteriologist Prof Hugh Pennington, of Aberdeen University, expressed concerns about both the safety risks and the value for money under the contingency plans and called for an inquiry into the situation. He said: ""On the face of it it does sound as if there wasn't a contingency plan that was going to deliver value for money and there was a contingency plan that certainly wasn't as safe, from what I've heard, as the work that was being done before. ""If it's costing twice as much then the public is being put at a disadvantage. ""Waste is being generated 24/7 and has to be got rid of, safely as well. ""If what I've been told is true people are being put, unnecessarily, at a greater risk than they should be."" Scottish Labour health spokeswoman Health Monica Lennon added: ""Professor Pennington is right to raise concerns and the SNP government would be foolish to dismiss these. HES treated their staff appallingly and tax payers are having to clean up the financial and environmental mess left behind."" The FoI response from NHS Scotland shows that about Â£7m was spent on contingency waste measures in just 15 weeks - equivalent to about Â£465,000 per week. The bulk of this went on ""operational and logistics"" measures for collecting the waste, while Â£2.2m went on disposal costs. Emails between NHS officials discussing waste contingency plans, which were also released under FoI, make reference to the ""significant increased cost compared to previously"". Correspondence also shows some GP practices did not have any collections for nearly a month between December last year and January, resulting in ""lots of bags of smelly waste lying in corridors or stored in cupboards etc which is unacceptable and also a hazard"". Waste was piled on top of containers at health centres in Coatbridge, Kilsyth and Cumbernauld in January but has since been collected BBC Scotland published pictures in January showing bags of clinical wastepiled high at three health centresin North Lanarkshire and at the time estimates suggested up to 300 tonnes of clinical waste and 10 tonnes of anatomical waste were also piled up at the HES plants in Dundee and Shotts, North Lanarkshire. Environment Secretary Roseanna Cunningham told MSPs in January the majority of the human waste was at the HES Shotts headquarters and any clearance operation was likely to cost about Â£250,000. The new waste disposal contract for Scotland has been awarded to the Spanish-owned firm Tradebe Healthcare National and is due to commence in August. A Scottish government spokeswoman said: ""The Scottish government provided Â£1.4m towards initial planning and once the contingency period ends the exact cost of these arrangements can be finalised. ""Procedures followed for clinical waste collection in hospitals are unchanged since HES ceased operating. ""All agreed contingency measures ensure that the environment and human health are appropriately protected. ""Scottish Environment Protection Agency is continuing to monitor the operation of these arrangements and to date their inspections have not identified any risk to human health or the environment.""

Line of Duty draws record audience,"L to R: Line of Duty stars Vicky McClure, Adrian Dunbar and Martin Compston More than nine million viewers tuned into the final episode of Line of Duty on Sunday, giving it the biggest overnight audience of 2019 so far. The tense conclusion to the BBC One drama's fifth series attracted an average audience of 9.1 million, according to overnight figures. Charlotte Moore, the BBC's director of content, said it was ""fantastic to see such a big audience"" for the show. Critics said the episode was ""breathtaking"" and ""deeply satisfying"". Yet some expressed reservations about the series as a whole, saying it has been ""lacklustre"" and the ""weakest"" to date. The BBC has already commissioned a sixth series from writer Jed Mercurio, who also wrote Bodyguard. Line of Duty's figures are the highest for a drama since last year's Bodyguard finale, which drewan overnight audience of 10.4 millionlast September. ITV's royal drama Victoria, which went out at the same time as Line of Duty on Sunday, attracted an average audience of 2.5 million. Do not read on if you do not want to know anything else about Line of Duty's final episode. Viewers on Sunday saw Ted Hastings (Adrian Dunbar), head of anti-corruption unit AC-12, interrogated at length by his superior Patricia Carmichael (Anna Maxwell Martin). The result,said the Telegraph's Allison Pearson,external, was ""an extraordinarily tense scene, a remarkable piece of theatre and one of the best things anyone will see this year on a TV screen."" The Times' Carol Midgley,externalsaid the scene was ""forensically written and beautifully executed"", while Jan Moir from the Daily Mail called it ""beautifully scripted,external"". Moir also praised a ""killer twist"" at the conclusion of a ""nerve-shredding"" episode that kept audiences ""guessing right until almost the end."" Anna Maxwell Martin returned as Patricia Carmichael in Sunday's episode ""The latest twist was a classic Line of Duty curveball,""wrote the Mirror's Ian Hyland,external- albeit one that ""stretched credibility to breaking point."" The Guardian's Lucy Mangan said it was ""as deeply satisfying as any in AC-12's history"" but said the series as a whole had ""felt like a placeholder season,external"". ""The twists are getting dafter but Line of Duty remains crazily compelling,"" wrote Mike Wardin the Express,external. The Independent's Ed Power, meanwhile, said the ""exceedingly talky,external"" episode ""wrap[ped] up most of its loose ends... with excessive leisureliness."" Twitter users have also had much to say about the episode, with praise being shared between the writing and its actors. ""The writing talent and sheer ballsy confidence of Jed Mercurio is breathtaking,""wrote broadcaster Muriel Gray,external, going on to salute the ""outstanding"" cast. The BBC's Dan Walker was particularly impressed by one scene featuring actors Vicky McClure and Martin Compston. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Moscow plane crash lands killing 41,"This video can not be played Passengers used emergency exit slides to escape Forty-one people died after a Russian plane made an emergency landing and burst into flames just after takeoff from Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport. Dramatic video shows passengers using emergency exit slides to escape the burning Aeroflot aircraft. Survivors suggest the plane was struck by lightning, but Russia's national carrier said only that it returned to the airport for technical reasons. Two children are among the dead. The jet had 73 passengers and five crew. Initial reports suggested the plane had landed on fire, but sources quoted by Russian news agency Interfax said the jet caught fire after a very bumpy landing. The aircraft landed with full fuel tanks because the crew lost contact with air traffic controllers and decided it was too dangerous to dump fuel over Moscow, Interfax added. ""There are 37 survivors - 33 passengers and four members of the crew,"" said Yelena Markovskaya, an official involved in the investigation of the crash. A flight attendant was also reportedly killed in the incident. Five people are in hospital. One witness said it was a ""miracle"" anyone escaped. Black smoke billows from the burning plane on the tarmac at Sheremetyevo airport The plane had just taken off from Sheremetyevo airport when it caught fire Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev has ordered a special committee to investigate the disaster. The aircraft, a Sukhoi Superjet-100, left the airport at 18:02 local time (15:02 GMT), bound for Murmansk. Its crew sent a distress signal when ""malfunctions"" occurred in bad weather shortly after take-off. After making an emergency landing at the airport, the plane's engines caught fire on the runway, Aeroflot said, adding that the crew ""did everything to save the passengers"". The rear of the Aeroflot plane was completely burnt out One passenger who survived the crash, Petr Egorov, was quoted by the Komsomolskaya Pravda daily newspaper as saying that the flight ""had just taken off and the aircraft was hit by lightning"", adding: ""The landing was rough - I almost passed out from fear."" The jet returned to the airport within 30 minutes of departing Aeroflotpublished a list of survivors,external(in Russian) who have been identified so far. Murmansk's Acting Governor Andrey Chibis has reportedly said that the families of those killed in the fire will each receive one million rubles ($15,300; Â£11,630), while the victims being treated in hospital will be given 500,000 rubles ($7,650; Â£5,815). Ambulances wait in front of the terminal building at Sheremetyevo airport Mikhail Savchenko claims he was on the plane when it exploded into a fireball on the tarmac but ""managed to jump out"". He shared a video of passengers running away from the burning plane, posting: ""'Guys I am all right, I am alive and in one piece."" Allow Instagram content?

One of the surviving passengers, Dmitry Khlebushkin, said that he was very grateful to the flight attendants. ""Only thanks to the flight attendants, I survived,"" he told reporters. Kristian Kostov, a former Bulgarian Eurovision contestant, has posted on social media about witnessing the incident. He said people at the airport were left ""shaking"" after seeing the aircraft engulfed by fire. Another eyewitness, Patrick Horlacher, told the BBC it was ""shocking to see"" the plane being ravaged by flames just minutes before he was due to board another flight. Russian President Vladimir Putin has reportedly been briefed and expressed condolences to the families of victims. The region of Murmansk has announced a three-day mourning period. With millions of commercial flights taking place every year, lightning strikes in the air are relatively common. Traditional planes, built using aluminium, are usually able to withstand such strikes as the shell or ""skin"" of the aircraft acts as a cage, distributing the electricity without causing damage and allowing them to continue their journey safely. Some newer aircraft are constructed using lighter materials that have lower electrical conductivity, such as carbon fibre, which need to be protected - often using wire mesh or foil. A plane takes to the air as lightning strikes (stock photo) In addition, the electronics and connections to an aircraft's fuel tanks are heavily shielded to protect them from external electrical bursts. Lightning strikes can cause technical malfunctions, causing planes to divert or make emergency landings for precautionary reasons. But crashes following such incidents are rare. A strike is still likely to be noticed by people on board, though. Passengers may hear loud bangs or experience the cabin lighting up with a bright flash. Have you been affected?

'Shocking' report details threat to nature,"Pollination is vital for food production On land, in the seas, in the sky, the devastating impact of humans on nature is laid bare in a compelling UN report. One million animal and plant species are now threatened with extinction. Nature everywhere is declining at a speed never previously seen and our need for ever more food and energy are the main drivers. These trends can be halted, the study says, but it will take ""transformative change"" in every aspect of how humans interact with nature. Five things we've learned from nature crisis study Nature's emergency in five graphics The teens saving Madagascar's wildlife What would a world without humans be like? From the bees that pollinate our crops, to the forests that hold back flood waters, the report reveals how humans are ravaging the very ecosystems that support their societies. Three years in the making, this global assessment of nature draws on 15,000 reference materials, and has been compiled by the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES). It runs to 1,800 pages. The brief, 40-page ""summary for policymakers"", published today at a meeting in Paris, is perhaps the most powerful indictment of how humans have treated their only home. It says that while the Earth has always suffered from the actions of humans through history, over the past 50 years, these scratches have become deep scars. The world's population has doubled since 1970, the global economy has grown four-fold, while international trade has increased 10 times over. To feed, clothe and give energy to this burgeoning world, forests have been cleared at astonishing rates, especially in tropical areas. Between 1980 and 2000, 100 million hectares of tropical forest were lost, mainly from cattle ranching in South America and palm oil plantations in South East Asia. Faring worse than forests are wetlands, with only 13% of those present in 1700 still in existence in the year 2000. Our cities have expanded rapidly, with urban areas doubling since 1992. This video can not be played ""Species are going extinct at a faster rate than we've seen for millions of years"" - Laura Foster reports All this human activity is killing species in greater numbers than ever before. According to the global assessment, an average of around 25% of animals and plants are now threatened. Global trends in insect populations are not known but rapid declines in some locations have also been well documented. All this suggests around a million species now face extinction within decades, a rate of destruction tens to hundreds of times higher than the average over the past 10 million years. ""We have documented a really unprecedented decline in biodiversity and nature, this is completely different than anything we've seen in human history in terms of the rate of decline and the scale of the threat,"" said Dr Kate Brauman, from the University of Minnesota and a co-ordinating lead author of the assessment. ""When we laid it all out together I was just shocked to see how extreme the declines are in terms of species and in terms of the contributions that nature is providing to people."" The assessment also finds that soils are being degraded as never before. This has reduced the productivity of 23% of the land surface of the Earth. Our insatiable appetites are producing a mountain of waste. Plastic pollution has increased ten-fold since 1980. Every year we dump 300-400 million tonnes of heavy metals, solvents, toxic sludge and other wastes into the waters of the world. The report's authors say there are a number of direct drivers of which land use change is the primary one. This essentially means the replacement of grassland with intensive crops, or replacing ancient woodland with a plantation forest, or the clearing of forests to grow crops. This is happening in many parts of the world, especially in the tropics. Since 1980, more than half of the increase in agriculture has been at the expense of intact forests. It's a similar story at sea. Only 3% of the world's oceans were described as free from human pressure in 2014. Fish are being exploited as never before, with 33% of fish stocks harvested at unsustainable levels in 2015. Many fish species are in decline through overfishing, the study says Live coral cover on reefs has nearly halved over the past 150 years. Pushing all this forward, though, are increased demands for food from a growing global population and specifically our growing appetite for meat and fish. ""Land use now appears as the major driver of the biodiversity collapse, with 70% of agriculture related to meat production,"" said Yann Laurans from IDDRI, the French policy research institute. ""It is time to reconsider the share of industrial meat and dairy in our diet."" The other key factors are the hunting and the direct exploitation of animals, climate change, pollution and invasive species. The report finds that many of these factors work together to make matters worse. At the report's launch, Kai Chan, a co-ordinating lead author from the University of British Columbia, Vancouver, said: ""No previous assessment has considered at this scale the simultaneous challenge of protecting nature, maintaining water, feeding the planet, supplying energy, while mitigating climate change... this is the most exhaustive report to have ever done that."" Species extinction risk:Approximately 25% of species are already threatened with extinction in most animal and plant groups studied. Natural ecosystems:Natural ecosystems have declined by 47% on average, relative to their earliest estimated states. Biomass and species abundance:The global biomass of wild mammals has fallen by 82%. Indicators of vertebrate abundance have declined rapidly since 1970. Nature for indigenous people:72% of indicators developed by local communities show ongoing deterioration of elements of nature important to them. It all depends on what we do. Researchers say the loss of nature will have major implications for humans The authors looked at a number of scenarios for the future, including business-as-usual, but also examining options that were more based on sustainable practices. In almost all cases, the negative trends for nature will continue to 2050 and beyond. The only ones that didn't continue towards ecological disaster involved what the scientists term ""transformative change"". The study doesn't tell governments what to do, but gives them some pretty strong hints. One big idea is to steer the world away from the ""limited paradigm of economic growth"". They suggest moving away from GDP as a key measure of economic wealth and instead adopting more holistic approaches that would capture quality of life and long-term effects. They argue that our traditional notion of a ""good quality of life"" has involved increasing consumption on every level. This has to change. Threat to food as biodiversity declines To keep carbon emissions down, look underfoot Dogs 'becoming major threat' to wildlife Insect decline may see 'plague of pests' Similarly, there must be change when it comes to financial incentives that damage biodiversity. ""Crucially, governments must end the destructive subsidies, including for fossil fuels and industrial fishing and agriculture,"" said Andrew Norton, director of the International Institute for Environment and Development. ""These drive the plundering of the land and ocean at the expense of a clean, healthy and diverse environment on which billions of women, children and men depend now and in the future."" The amount of land and sea that is under protection needs to increase rapidly, with observers saying that a third of our lands need to be preserved. ""We need to secure half of the planet by 2050 with an interim target of 30% by 2030,"" said Jonathan Baillie, from the National Geographic Society. ""Then we must restore nature and drive innovation. Only then will we leave future generations a healthy and sustainable planet."" Climate change is a crucial underlying factor that's helping to drive destruction around the world. Greenhouse gas emissions have doubled since 1980 and temperatures have gone up 0.7C as a result. This is having a big impact on some species, restricting their ranges and making extinction more likely. The global assessment finds that if temperatures go up by 2C, then 5% of species are at risk of climate-driven extinction, rising to 16% if the world warms by 4.3C. ""Of the prioritised list of proximate drivers of biodiversity decline, climate change is only number three,"" said Prof John Spicer from the University of Plymouth. ""Climate change is certainly one of the greatest threats that face humankind in the near future - so what does that tell us about the first and second, changes in land/sea use, and direct exploitation? The current situation is desperate and has been for some time."" The report's authors hope that their assessment becomes as critical to the argument about biodiversity loss as the IPCC report on 1.5C has done to the debate over climate change. The idea of transformative action is not just confined to governments or local authorities. Individuals can certainly make a difference. ""We know that the way people eat today is often unhealthy for them and for the planet,"" said Dr Kate Brauman, one of the report's authors. ""We can become healthier as individuals by eating more diverse diets, with more vegetables, and we can also make the planet healthier by growing that food in more sustainable ways."" As well as consumer and lifestyle choices, other authors believe people can make a difference through politics. ""It might be more important for society to invest more in renewables than coal,"" said Dr Rinku Roy Chowdhury, from Clark University in Worcester, Massachusetts. ""So how do you that? Through individual behaviour, through the polling booth. ""Rather than just conserving energy by turning my lights off, some other less obvious means might be through political action.""

The teens saving Madagascar's wildlife,"Nantenaina, 15, is one of the young farmers working to save the forest and to make a living The island nation of Madagascar has a dubious accolade: it is the world-leader in deforestation. Now, some of the island's teenagers have started a farming revolution - working to stop food production from destroying the island's rich rainforest. The bridge across the river to Mangabe has collapsed. Probably many years ago. Just a few wooden stumps now protrude from the murky water separating densely forested riverbanks. The only way across is on an unnervingly wobbly canoe. We crouch low - backpacks at our feet - gripping the sides of that canoe as it is expertly steered across the water. We are less than 100 miles from the capital of Madagascar, Antananarivo, but this is a stark reminder of just how remote the communities of this protected area are. When we have crossed the river, it is still a two-hour walk to Mangabe village. We're going there to meet a group of Malagasy teenagers - young famers who are leading a small but vital revolution - transforming how people farm in order to save their forest. Nature loss: Major report to highlight natural and human emergency Sold for a song: The rare birds captured for their tuneful voices Lemur extinction: Vast majority of species under threat This video can not be played Madagascar's forests are home to 100 species of lemur found nowhere else on the planet Almost 9,000km away in Paris, at a glossy, international gathering, scientists and politicians are finalising an assessment on humanity's relationship with nature. With its somewhat ungainly title, theIntergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services,external(IPBES) will publish a seminal upsum of the ecological emergency our planet is facing; humanity's impact on the natural world. There is little doubt that, worldwide, humanity struggles to coexist with other species that inhabit the planet - even some that we are keenly aware that we need. Biodiversity encompasses pollinating insects we rely on for food, trees and plants that provide clean air and water and the network of life underfoot that keeps soil fertile and productive. It is the network of life - we depend on it. The global report due on 6 May has the lofty goal of setting out a path to a more sustainable future. But here in Mangabe, communities live alongside one of the richest, most diverse rainforests in the world. They make their livelihoods entirely through farming; here the link between people and the forest is palpable and inextricable. A forest guide holds a chameleon in Mangabe forest ""If the forest is lost, many things will be lost,"" explains Voahirana Randriamamonjy from the Malagasy conservation organisationMadagasikara Voakajy,external. The diminutive, unstoppably optimistic conservationist has been working with the young people of Mangabe's communities for the last three years. ""It's not just about the wildlife. Without the forest, there will be no clean water for people to drink, the soil will lose its fertility and be eroded away,"" he says. ""The forest even provides medicine,"" she adds. ""It takes hours to walk to a doctor from these villages, so people rely on natural remedies that grow here."" Local communities depend entirely on the land and what they can grow As well as being our hosts and guides, Voahirana and her team are here to meet with and to train the teenage recruits as part of their ""Youth for Lemurs"" project. This community-based mission sets out to provide the new generation of farmers with the skills, knowledge and tools to be able to grow their food without destroying the forest. Conservationist Voahirana Randriamamonjy Traditionally, Voahirana explains, forest destruction and farming go hand in hand. ""The old method is often called  'slash and burn' - cutting down a patch of forest and setting fire to it. Ash makes a good fertiliser."" But when the nutrients in the ash are used up, that cycle of slash and burn starts again. ""It causes a great deal of deforestation here in Madagascar,"" says Voahirana. That has contributed to a dubious accolade; Madagascar is the world-leader in deforestation. In 2017 alone, 500,000 hectares were cut down - half a million football pitches of rich, diverse rainforest. Gone. The situation has become so dire that a group of Malagasy and international scientists have come together to urge the new government here to take steps to preserve the country's famous biodiversity. The rice harvest is a task for the whole community in Mangabe ""Madagascar's irreplaceable forests are burning and there are species threatened by the pet trade which will go extinct in the next few years if things don't change,"" explains Prof Julia Jones from Bangor University, UK, who ledthat study,external. ""The link to human well-being is often less clear for biodiversity loss than it is for climate change, but effective conservation is essential. If Madagascar lost its lemurs, its forests, its coral reefs, it would be so much poorer."" It is that pattern of destruction that the young people of Mangabe are now working to break away from. Mangabe forest is officially protected. But looking over its landscape, you can see where farms have bitten chunks out of irreplaceable habitat. Where it is intact, under the shade of its dense canopy, there is a palpable sense of what a biodiversity hotspot it is. Vines wrap around trees that are surrounded by leafy plants buzzing with insects. As we follow our guides along the path to the village, a nearby tree shakes - an indri lemur bounds quickly away from us. When one of our guides, Emille, gently flicks over one particular leaf, a minuscule, bright orange frog is sheltering beneath. Even small-scale farming drives deforestation, but people need space to grow their food It is a golden mantella - a critically endangered amphibian that - like so many species here - lives only in Madagascar. ""This forest is unique - it's a very special place,"" says Voahirana. Golden mantella frogs are critically endangered On our first morning in Mangabe village there is a buzz of activity. The community is planning a meeting to welcome the visitors and to launch a new season for the Youth for Lemurs project. The charity - Madagasikara Voakajy - will recruit and train a new group of young volunteers in 10 villages around the forest; this year, they are starting in Mangabe. Voahirana, her colleague Harifefitra and the rest of the team will provide the dozen or so new recruits with tools and seeds, as well as the new skills and knowledge. ""They tell us what they want to grow and we give them the training,"" explains Harifefitra. On an experimental plot, the young farmers can try out new crops That training consists of how to make compost as a fertiliser and how to rotate the crops you grow to produce a better yield. These modern farming techniques may not appear revolutionary, but they provide life-changing benefits. They enable the same plot to be farmed each season, eliminating the need to move into the forest. And they produce higher yields. The village has an experimental plot where the the teenagers practise their skills and try growing new crops. Rows of sweet potatoes are flourishing and there are papaya and lychee trees at each end. When we visit in the morning, this year's volunteers are busily weeding and pruning the fruit trees. Voahirana demonstrates the right branches to snip. Nantenaina is weeding around the papaya tree. At 15-years-old, her pensive expression gives her an air of worry that makes her seem older than her years. But when she talks about what she has learned, she is positively glowing. Mangabe forest is now a protected area - one of the pockets of Malagasy rainforest still intact ""I feel very happy,"" she says. ""By planting just a small surface of land, I can produce high yield. And if we can do this it means people will not cut and clear the forest. ""We have a beautiful forest in Mangabe - that's why I became involved in this project."" Her friend, Omega - a gangly, smiling 16-year old boy - shows off his knowledge of just how valuable the forest is. Omega is one of the Youth for Lemurs volunteers ""It provides the fresh air we breathe and helps the livelihoods of the local people,"" he explains. ""If it continued to be destroyed, there would be less water to drink. There would be a loss of habitat for wildlife in the forest, such as the lemurs - they would disappear. They would all die."" Nantenaina says that, since the project started three years ago, older villagers have started coming to the young pioneers for advice about their methods - wanting to understand how they achieve their higher yields. ""The future of the forest, says Voahirana, ""depends on these young people"". ""They have these new skills, which they can teach to their kids. So the next generation will be able to farm sustainably."" As Madagascar's recently elected president, Andry Rajoelina, begins a five-year term of office, scientists and conservationists who have spent decades studying and protecting Madagascar's natural habitats hope that this will be a turning point. They say this is the last chance to prevent habitats and species unique to this island nation from being lost forever. ""In a place like Madagascar conservation has to be very careful to ensure that it doesn't have a negative impact on poor rural communities whose livelihoods depend on using natural resources,"" Prof Jones stresses. ""It has to be about people and about tenure. People at the forest frontier need to have their rights to agricultural land respected. ""If you had an allotment and you're told you only have it for one year, you're not going to invest in its future - improve the soil and put in fruit trees or asparagus plants. You might just grow a few lettuces you could eat that year."" Professor Jonah Ratsimbazafy, from the University of Antananarivo and one of the paper's co-authors, added: ""The United States have the Statue of Liberty, France has the Eiffel towerâ¦. For us in Madagascar, it is our biodiversity - the product of millions of years of evolution. ""It is the unique heritage we are known for around the world. We cannot let these natural wonders, including 100 different types of lemur found nowhere else, disappear"". But however much people want to protect the forest, adds Prof Jones, ""they need to be able to feed their families. Shifting towards more productive forms of agriculture can be beneficial for people and for the environment."" But as much as the teenagers of Mangabe are working hard to save their forest, the youngest, poorest people simply do not have the power and resources to drive change in Madagascar. ""If people want a world in which lemurs [live], people in richer countries may well need to be willing to help cover some of the costs of protecting that forest,"" says Prof Jones. ""This involves supporting organisations such as Madagasikara Voakajy to do what they do. ""They work on a shoe-string, protecting some of the most threatened species on the planet by working with some of the poorest people on the planet. I personally feel they deserve our support."" Dore now supplements his income by working as a forest guide and ranger with the charity On the morning that we leave Mangabe village and head back through the forest towards the river and that wobbly canoe - we hear indri call. It is a haunting song that seems to fill the entire valley. ""We're very proud that the indri live here,"" says our guide, Dore. He is Mamtemaima's father and he was born and raised in Mangabe. ""They are like a clock for the local people - they know what time it is when they hear them sing. ""In other places, the forests are being cut down, he adds. ""But not here. Here we preserve the forest because it gives us so many things that improve our lives. We're so proud of the rainforest.""

Chinese shares hit by Trump tariff threat,"US trade representative Robert Lighthizer spoke of an ""erosion"" of commitments US trade representative Robert Lighthizer has accused China of backtracking on commitments in trade talks, but insisted a deal on tariffs is still possible. He said President Trump's threat to impose new taxes on Chinese exports came after China reneged on promises. But he said a Chinese delegation was still expected in Washington on Thursday for a further round of talks. US stocks regained ground after sharp falls earlier. US-China trade war in 300 words US and China agree to suspend new tariffs The next US-China battleground On Sunday Mr Trump said on Twitter the US would more than double tariffs on $200bn (Â£152bn) of Chinese goods on Friday and could introduce fresh tariffs. Speaking to reporters on Monday, Mr Lighthizer said: ""Over the course of the last week or so we have seen an erosion in commitments by China. That in our view is unacceptable."" He said China had tried to substantively change the text of an agreement between the countries as it was nearing its final stages. ""We're not breaking off talks at this point. But for now... come Friday there will be tariffs in place,"" Mr Lighthizer said. Earlier, world stock markets sank following the president's tweets, with the Shanghai Composite tumbling 5.6%. However in the US the Dow Jones closed down just 0.3%, having slumped 471 points - almost 1.8% - in early trading. China's top trade official Liu He will is still expected to return to Washington this week On Sunday the US president tweeted that tariffs of 10% on certain goods would rise to 25% on Friday, and $325bn of untaxed goods could face 25% duties ""shortly"". ""The Trade Deal with China continues, but too slowly, as they attempt to renegotiate. No!"" he tweeted. He followed that on Monday by tweeting that the US had been ""losing"" $500bn a year on trade with China. ""Sorry, we're not going to be doing that anymore!"" his tweet said. After imposing duties on billions of dollars worth of one another's goods last year, the US and China have been negotiating and in recent weeks, appeared to be close to striking a deal. Last week US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin described talks held in Beijing as ""productive"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

But according to reports, in recent days US officials have become frustrated by China's refusal to change its laws as part of the deal - something that had previously been agreed. Other sticking points have included how to enforce a deal, whether and how fast to roll back tariffs already imposed and issues around intellectual property protection. On Monday, US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told reporters that the negotiations were 90% complete but that Chinese negotiators were trying to ""go back on language that had been previously negotiated"". ""[This was] very clear language, that had the potential of changing the deal dramatically,"" he said. So far, the US has imposed tariffs on $250bn of Chinese goods, having accused the country of unfair trade practices. Beijing hit back with duties on $110bn of US goods, blaming the US for starting ""the largest trade war in economic history"". The US is the biggest export market for Chinese goods However, some analysts have questioned whether Mr Trump's threats are a negotiating tactic. William Reinsch, trade policy expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said China would never meet all the US demands. ""At some point the president is going to figure out that they're not going to give him everything he wants,"" he told news agency AFP. That will put Mr Trump in ""a precarious political position"" whether ""to accept an agreement that will be criticised as weak, or not to have an agreement and be criticised for failing"". Mr Trump's latest move will raise duties on more than 5,000 products made by Chinese producers, ranging from chemicals to textiles and consumer goods. The US president originally imposed a 10% tariff on these goods in September that was due to rise in January, but postponed this as negotiations advanced. Fears about a further escalation caused a slump in world stock markets towards the end of last year. The IMF has warned a full-blown trade war wouldweaken the global economy.

'Nature's emergency is our emergency too',"Scientists and government officials meet this week in Paris to finalise a key assessment on humanity's relationship with nature. TheIntergovernmental Panel for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services,external, or IPBES, will issue the first report of this type since 2005. It will detail the past losses and future prospects for nature and humans. One author says the report will highlight the ""social and ecological emergency"" the world is now facing. Tropical tree loss persists at high levels Threat to food as biodiversity declines 'Beast of Beddau' is new millipede find From Monday some of the world's leading researchers in the field of biodiversity will meet in the French capital to work through the details of their report with representatives from 132 governments. Their conclusions, known as a Summary for Policymakers, will then be published on 6 May. ""I would say that this is the most comprehensive assessment on the state of nature and humanity's place in it,"" said Prof Sir Robert Watson, who chairs IPBES. ""It is the first intergovernmental assessment - this is much more powerful in my view, it means that governments are fully involved."" Biodiversity is just a sciencey word for all the amazing variety of life that can be found on Earth, their interactions with each other and with their environments. Pollination is one of the key services that nature provides to humans It encompasses everything from genes, through individual species such as orang-utans, through communities of creatures and then the whole ecological complexes of which they are part. The phrase, which originated in the 1980s, is a contraction of the words ""biological"" and ""diversity"". It was more formally defined in theUN's Convention on Biological Diversity,externalsigned in 1992 as: ""Biological diversity"" means the variability among living organisms from all sources including, inter alia, terrestrial, marine and other aquatic ecosystems and the ecological complexes of which they are part: this includes diversity within species, between species and of ecosystems."" Well, the air you breathe depends on plants producing oxygen, and without bees to pollinate crops, we wouldn't have so many things to eat. Biodiversity helps provide and maintain our fresh water, fertile soils, our medicines, a stable climate and gives us places for recreation. All species are interconnected and often depend on each other. So while fungi help maintain the soils of the forest, these healthy soils help plants to grow, insects then carry pollen from one plant to another, animals can eat the plants, and the forest as a whole provides a home for animals. Losing one species in this chain may not seem like much but each loss weakens the connections that benefit us all. Back in the 1980s, conservation researchers Paul and Anne Ehrlich said that species are to ecosystems what rivets are to a plane's wing. Losing one might not be a problem, but each loss adds to the likelihood of a disaster. It matters because it will highlight the shocking losses that have hit the natural world over the past 50 years, and will warn that the future is looking bleak for tens of thousands of species. It will also highlight the threat to humans if the devastation of nature continues. More than two billion people rely on wood fuel for energy, while around four billion rely on natural medicines. Some three-quarters of our food crops require pollination by insects. One of the scientists involved told the BBC that the assessment would underline the fact that the world is now facing both a natural and a human emergency. ""Social and environmental changes are much more connected than we have portrayed them in the past,"" said Prof Unai Pascual, from the Basque Centre for Climate Change, Spain, who is a lead author on the report. ""This assessment will show these connections are based on robust scientific evidence; The evidence is clearer than ever that the negative impacts on nature that we are pushing translate into detrimental changes in people's wellbeing, and that for an increasing proportion of the population on our planet the emergency is not just an ecological emergency, but it is turning into a social and ecological emergency."" Researchers say the loss of nature will have big implications for humans Much of the research about impacts on individual species, such as on bees and other pollinators, has been published before. In the global assessment, the research team takes a much broader view of what's been happening to the natural world. For three years, 150 experts from more than 50 countries have looked at 15,000 sources of information. One significant way in which this assessment differs from previous publications is that it uses knowledge from people who have been living in and preserving ecosystems for generations. ""We have a systematic strategy to include indigenous and local knowledge,"" said Prof Sandra Diaz from Cordoba National University in Argentina and a co-ordinating lead author for the report. ""So the evidence of what's going on, the different practices to maintain and enhance diversity will not only come from mainstream science but will also come from the deep knowledge of people who have been managing diversity for a long time around the world. So I think we will have a much richer picture than previous assessments."" The full report, stretching to 1,800 pages, will be published at the same time as the 40-page summary. The details of the summary will remain under wraps until the scientists and political representatives have agreed every last word. However, as much of the information has been published in one form or another in previous years, we have a reasonable idea of the key messages. It will likely warn that we are on the brink of a rapid acceleration of the global rate of loss of species. And it will say the threat these losses pose - and the challenge that presents - is on a par with climate change. It's probable also that it will say that farming, deforestation and our demands for energy are undermining the services we get from nature. ""I want people to know that nature is really important, and we shouldn't destroy it, and it is absolutely essential to food, water and energy security,"" said Prof Sir Robert Watson. ""I want the public to say that we should not be destroying it and urge their governments to make sure they have the right policies in place and to ask: 'what can I do in my everyday life to be more sustainable?'"" Climate change will feature heavily in the assessment and is closely linked to the fate of species. The scientists at IPBES believe the threat from the loss of nature will be as big a challenge to the world as rising temperatures. This rise is also playing a key role in the destruction of nature. For example, the range of a much larger number of species will be affected by a rise in global temperatures this century of 2 degrees C than by a rise of 1.5C. The researchers hope that just asthe report from the IPCCwoke the world up to the scale of the threat of climate change last Autumn, the IPBES report will do the same for nature. ""If you look at IPCC, they managed to show that climate change was a problem for the whole world,"" said Prof Sandra Diaz. ""Now, it is a problem that no-one ignores."" Not exactly. The scientists are meant to avoid being ""policy prescriptive"", which means they can't tell the governments what to do about the crisis facing the natural world. However, the scale of concern is so great that some researchers feel that the report can't afford to pull its punches. Sir Robert Watson, who will chair the Paris meeting and the report, says the researchers won't be afraid to tackle sensitive issues. ""We talk about some of the drivers of change, such as economic growth, and population growth, because the more people you have and the wealthier they are the more they consume, and the more pressure that puts on nature. Some might say the issue of population is politically sensitive but we don't avoid it."" While the report will likely highlight the policy choices that governments can make, and the implications of those choices, one key takeaway will be that nature and humanity cannot continue to have a ""win-win"" situation at our current levels of consumption. ""I think this is going to be one of the main messages; we have to be very mindful that having more of everything is not possible now,"" said Prof Unai Pascual. ""We have to be much smarter in how we allocate our resources to make sure we have sufficient for everyone. ""We need to understand the trade-offs, because once you lose biodiversity it is difficult to reverse.""

'Silent crisis' as species losses mount,"The world's most comprehensive, and damning, report on the state of nature will be released on Monday in Paris. The UN's Global Assessment will highlight the distressing impact that humanity is having on the natural world. It will probably state that species are being lost at the fastest ever rate, mainly driven by the changing use of land. Rapid action is needed at the political level to avoid an ecological disaster. Nature's emergency in five graphics The teens saving Madagascar's wildlife Threat to food as biodiversity declines What would a world without humans be like? TheIntergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services,external(IPBES) has spent the last three years working on the 1,800-page assessment. For the last week, the lead authors have been meeting government representatives from over 130 countries in Paris to hammer out the final details of a much shorter summary report. This study will underline just how much humanity relies on the natural world, whether it is for food, clean water, or to absorb the warming CO2 gas that's driving climate change. It is expected to show, in grim detail, how humans have trampled all over the natural world over the past 50 years - and what is likely to happen over the coming decades unless major changes are implemented. This video can not be played ""Species are going extinct at a faster rate than we've seen for millions of years"" - Laura Foster reports ""I would say that the report is likely to be interpreted as 'Boy, we are in trouble' but there are solutions,"" said the chair of IPBES Prof Sir Bob Watson, speaking to the BBC before the meeting. ""Our report will talk about to what degree are we losing biodiversity, and to what degree could we protect some of it in the future."" The study will analyse the impacts that the changing use of land is having on nature. Forest clearing for agriculture, fuelled by increased consumption of animal products, has driven many native species from their ancient homes. Overfishing has caused the decimation of fish stocks in most parts of the world. Wild cats are now a rare sight in the UK The report will warn that the speed of loss is likely to increase in the coming decades, pushing vast numbers of species towards extinction. Speaking at the opening of the meeting in Paris, France's minister for the ecological and inclusive transition, FranÃ§ois de Rugy, compared the loss of biodiversity to the damage caused by climate change. Unlike rising temperatures, which has seen a massive rise in public awareness around the world, the slow loss of nature was a ""more silent crisis,"" he said. Skylarks have declined by 50% over the past 40 years across Europe Taken together the increasing speed of rising temperatures and species is the gradual but accelerating species extinction, which, in combination with climate change, produces a worldwide ""bio-climatic crisis."" Ahead of the report, some600 conservation campaigners,externalfrom 50 different countries signed an open letter, initiated by the campaign group WWF. To keep carbon emissions down, look underfoot Dogs 'becoming major threat' to wildlife Insect decline may see 'plague of pests' The letter, which has been published in major newspapers around the world, calls for urgent political action in light of the IPBES report. ""There is still time to protect what is left and to start restoring nature,"" the letter says. ""But to do that, we must radically change the way we live, including how we use energy to power our societies, grow our food, and manage our wasteâ¦ But for this to happen, we need decisive and ambitious action from world leaders."" While the demise of species thanks to deforestation and land clearing in developing countries will be well documented in the report, the threat to nature is just as significant in richer countries. Friends of the Earth has published a list of some of the most threatened species in the UK and Europe. Skylark:Well known for its flight pattern, the skylark has declined by 50% over the past 40 years across Europe, mainly due to changes in farming practices that have resulted in the loss of nesting sites and food sources. Small Blue Butterfly: This has declined in the most parts of the UK, with numbers down 38% since the 1970s. Bees and hoverflies: Recent studies show that around one third of the 353 wild bee and hoverfly species in the UK are in decline. Factors include habitat loss, climate change, pesticides and disease. Red Squirrels, wildcats and long-eared bats:All facing severe threats to their survival from a number of sources, including invasive species, road deaths and the use of pesticides. Hedgehogs:Almost half of rural hedgehogs in the UK and a third in urban areas have been lost says Friends of the Earth. The reasons are not fully understood but are likely to include the loss of key habitat features such as hedges.

China stocks tumble on Trump tariff threat,"US trade representative Robert Lighthizer spoke of an ""erosion"" of commitments US trade representative Robert Lighthizer has accused China of backtracking on commitments in trade talks, but insisted a deal on tariffs is still possible. He said President Trump's threat to impose new taxes on Chinese exports came after China reneged on promises. But he said a Chinese delegation was still expected in Washington on Thursday for a further round of talks. US stocks regained ground after sharp falls earlier. US-China trade war in 300 words US and China agree to suspend new tariffs The next US-China battleground On Sunday Mr Trump said on Twitter the US would more than double tariffs on $200bn (Â£152bn) of Chinese goods on Friday and could introduce fresh tariffs. Speaking to reporters on Monday, Mr Lighthizer said: ""Over the course of the last week or so we have seen an erosion in commitments by China. That in our view is unacceptable."" He said China had tried to substantively change the text of an agreement between the countries as it was nearing its final stages. ""We're not breaking off talks at this point. But for now... come Friday there will be tariffs in place,"" Mr Lighthizer said. Earlier, world stock markets sank following the president's tweets, with the Shanghai Composite tumbling 5.6%. However in the US the Dow Jones closed down just 0.3%, having slumped 471 points - almost 1.8% - in early trading. China's top trade official Liu He will is still expected to return to Washington this week On Sunday the US president tweeted that tariffs of 10% on certain goods would rise to 25% on Friday, and $325bn of untaxed goods could face 25% duties ""shortly"". ""The Trade Deal with China continues, but too slowly, as they attempt to renegotiate. No!"" he tweeted. He followed that on Monday by tweeting that the US had been ""losing"" $500bn a year on trade with China. ""Sorry, we're not going to be doing that anymore!"" his tweet said. After imposing duties on billions of dollars worth of one another's goods last year, the US and China have been negotiating and in recent weeks, appeared to be close to striking a deal. Last week US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin described talks held in Beijing as ""productive"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

But according to reports, in recent days US officials have become frustrated by China's refusal to change its laws as part of the deal - something that had previously been agreed. Other sticking points have included how to enforce a deal, whether and how fast to roll back tariffs already imposed and issues around intellectual property protection. On Monday, US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told reporters that the negotiations were 90% complete but that Chinese negotiators were trying to ""go back on language that had been previously negotiated"". ""[This was] very clear language, that had the potential of changing the deal dramatically,"" he said. So far, the US has imposed tariffs on $250bn of Chinese goods, having accused the country of unfair trade practices. Beijing hit back with duties on $110bn of US goods, blaming the US for starting ""the largest trade war in economic history"". The US is the biggest export market for Chinese goods However, some analysts have questioned whether Mr Trump's threats are a negotiating tactic. William Reinsch, trade policy expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said China would never meet all the US demands. ""At some point the president is going to figure out that they're not going to give him everything he wants,"" he told news agency AFP. That will put Mr Trump in ""a precarious political position"" whether ""to accept an agreement that will be criticised as weak, or not to have an agreement and be criticised for failing"". Mr Trump's latest move will raise duties on more than 5,000 products made by Chinese producers, ranging from chemicals to textiles and consumer goods. The US president originally imposed a 10% tariff on these goods in September that was due to rise in January, but postponed this as negotiations advanced. Fears about a further escalation caused a slump in world stock markets towards the end of last year. The IMF has warned a full-blown trade war wouldweaken the global economy.

US sends aircraft carrier to Iran,"A file photo from 2004 of the USS Abraham Lincoln, which is currently on its way to the Gulf The US has deployed an aircraft carrier to the Middle East to send a ""clear and unmistakable message"" to Iran. National Security Adviser John Bolton said the administration was acting ""in response to a number of troubling and escalatory indications and warnings"". The deployment of the warship was based on claims of a possible attack on US forces stationed in the region, unnamed US officials are quoted as saying. Mr Bolton added that they would counter any attack with ""unrelenting force"". In a statement, Mr Bolton said: ""The United States is deploying the USS Abraham Lincoln Carrier Strike Group and a bomber task force to the US Central Command region to send a clear and unmistakeable message to the Iranian regime that any attack on United States interests or on those of our allies will be met with unrelenting force."" John Bolton said the US was ""not seeking war"" with Iran He added: ""The United States is not seeking war with the Iranian regime. But we are fully prepared to respond to any attack, whether by proxy, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps or regular Iranian forces."" The ship was already in Europe for war games with US allies that have been taking place since the end of April. Preparing for war? So far there is little detail from the Americans of the alleged Iranian actions that have prompted this warning nor of the specific US deployments under way. It is not unusual for an aircraft carrier and its battle group to be sent to the Gulf. Reinforcing US land-based air assets in the region, albeit temporarily, is less routine. Washington has itself been turning up the pressure on Iran over recent months; designating the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps a terrorist entity; toughening up oil sanctions and so on. But the Trump administration's goal is unclear. Its spokesmen insist that they do not want war with Iran but they can also barely hide their enthusiasm for regime change in Tehran. So is this US move an attempt to guarantee the existing, uneasy status quo ? Or is it an attempt to turn the screw even tighter? Many critics of the administration fear a developing drumbeat towards a conflict which, they fear, could erupt either by accident or by design. The deployment comes amid growing tensions between the US and Iran. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told reporters on a trip to Europe: ""It is absolutely the case that we have seen escalatory actions from the Iranians and it is equally the case that we will hold the Iranians accountable for attacks on American interests."" He did not explain what he meant by ""escalatory actions"", however he added: ""We have good reason to want to communicate clearly about how the Iranians should understand how we will respond to actions they may take."" Last year President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew from a landmark nuclear deal the US and other nations had agreed with Iran in 2015. Under the accord, Iran had agreed to limit its sensitive nuclear activities and allow in international inspectors in return for sanctions relief. And last month the White House said it would end exemptions from sanctions for five countries - China, India, Japan, South Korea and Turkey - that were still buying Iranian oil. How renewed US sanctions have hit Iran hard Is it about to become more expensive to fill my car? At the same timethe US also blacklisted Iran's elite Revolutionary Guard Corps, designating it as a foreign terrorist group. The Trump administration hopes to compel Iran to negotiate a ""new deal"" that would cover not only its nuclear activities, but also its ballistic missile programme and what officials call its ""malign behaviour"" across the Middle East. The sanctions have led to a sharp downturn in Iran's economy, pushing the value of its currency to record lows, driving away foreign investors, and triggering protests. Iran has repeatedly threatened to retaliate to the US measures by blocking the Strait of Hormuz - though which about a fifth of all oil consumed globally pass.
