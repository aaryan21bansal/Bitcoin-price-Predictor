Protesters gather at Alfie Evans hospital,"This video can not be played Hundreds gathered outside Alder Hey Hospital on Thursday night Hundreds of people have staged a protest outside a hospital in Merseyside where a terminally ill toddler is being cared for. A date to switch off the life support for Alfie Evans has been set by a High Court judge following a legal battle. Alfie's parents' legal fight against the decision ultimately ended in March when theEuropean Court of Human Rights rejected their case. Merseyside Police had asked protesters at Alder Hey to be respectful. Officers said the ""large"" and ""peaceful"" protest in Liverpool on Thursday night ""did cause significant traffic disruption and inconvenience for other people trying to access the hospital"". Alfie has been at Alder Hey since December 2016 with an undiagnosed degenerative brain disease. His parents Tom Evans and Kate James, who are both in their 20s and from Liverpool, have lost cases in the High Court, Court of Appeal, and had their case rejected by the Supreme Court and European Court of Human Rights. Alfie Evans has been treated at Alder Hey Children's Hospital since December 2016 The family told the BBC they had a private ambulance and jet on stand-by. They say the court order would end at the point the hospital removes ventilation from Alfie, at which moment they will take over and fly him to Rome. Alder Hey say they will not allow that to happen but speaking on Thursday evening Mr Evans said they were confident they would succeed. He said: ""There's no court order to say Alfie has to stay in this hospital right now. ""The truth behind the matter is that me and Kate hold full responsibility and we can take him to our transportation van with full equipment with the doctors who have got full duty of careâ¦ and they are not allowing us so we are hoping that my solicitor is going to spin the spoon and get us out."" Alfie's parents want him to be removed from Alder Hey and taken to the Bambino Gesu hospital - which has links to the Vatican.

One drink a day 'can shorten your life',"Regularly drinking above the UK alcohol guidelines can take years off your life,according to a major report.,external The study of 600,000 drinkers estimated that having 10 to 15 alcoholic drinks every week could shorten a person's life by between one and two years. And they warned that people who drink more than 18 drinks a week could lose four to five years of their lives. The2016 UK guidelinesrecommend no more than 14 units a week, which is six pints of beer or seven glasses of wine. Authors of the Lancet study said their findings backed up the new guidelines and also said they did not find an increased risk of death for light drinkers. Your guide to alcohol drinking limits Alcohol limits cut to reduce risks Booze calculator: What's your drinking nationality? Scientists, who compared the health and drinking habits of alcohol drinkers in 19 countries, modelled how much life a person could expect to lose if they drank the same way for the rest of their lives from the age of 40. They found people who drank the equivalent of about five to 10 drinks a week could shorten their lives by up to six months. The study's authors also found drinking increased the risk of cardiovascular illness, with every 12.5 units of alcohol people drank above the guidelines raising the risk of: Stroke by 14% Fatal hypertensive disease by 24% Heart failure by 9% Fatal aortic aneurysm by 15% Drinking alcohol was linked with a reduced risk of non-fatal heart disease, but scientists said this benefit was wiped out by a higher risk of other forms of the illness. Previous studies have suggested that drinking red wine can be good for our hearts, althoughsome scientists have suggested these benefits may be overhyped. Another Danish study found drinking three to four times a weekwas linked to a lower risk of type 2 diabetes. ""This study makes clear that on balance there are no health benefits from drinking alcohol, which is usually the case when things sound too good to be true,"" said Tim Chico, professor of cardiovascular medicine at the University of Sheffield, who was not involved in the research. ""Although non-fatal heart attacks are less likely in people who drink, this benefit is swamped by the increased risk of other forms of heart disease including fatal heart attacks and stroke."" This video can not be played The UK's drinking limits are at the right level, Richard Piper from Alcohol Research UK says Scientists say the study challenges the idea that drinking in moderation is good for our health Recommended limits in Italy, Portugal, and Spain are almost 50% higher than the UK guidelines, and in the USA the upper limit for men is nearly double this. But Victoria Taylor, senior dietician at the British Heart Foundation, which partly funded the study, said this did not mean the UK ""should rest on its laurels"". ""Many people in the UK regularly drink over what's recommended"" she said. ""We should always remember that alcohol guidelines should act as a limit, not a target, and try to drink well below this threshold."" Dr Angela Wood, from the University of Cambridge, lead author of the study, said: ""The key message of this research is that, if you already drink alcohol, drinking less may help you live longer and lower your risk of several cardiovascular conditions.""

Why some cancers are 'born to be bad',"A groundbreaking study has uncovered why some patients' cancers are more deadly than others, despite appearing identical. Francis Crick Institute scientists developed a way of analysing a cancer's history to predict its future. The study on kidney cancer patients showed some tumours were ""born to be bad"" while others never became aggressive and may not need treating. Cancer Research UK says the study could help patients get the best care. ""We don't really have tools to differentiate between those that need treatment and those that can be observed,"" said researcher and cancer doctor Samra Turajlic. One cancer could kill quickly while a patient with a seemingly identical cancer could live for decades after treatment. It means uncertainty for both the patient and the doctor. It is most common in people in their 60s and 70s. Symptoms include: Blood in your pee Persistent pain in the lower back or side Sometimes a lump or swelling in your side The work, published in three papers in the journal Cell, analysed kidney cancers in 100 patients. The team at the Crick performed a sophisticated feat of genetics to work out the cancer's history. It works like a paternity or ancestry test on steroids. As cancers grow and evolve, they become more mutated and, eventually, different parts of the tumour start to mutate in different ways. Researchers take dozens of samples from different parts of the same tumour and then work out how closely related they are. It allows scientists to piece together the evolutionary history of the whole tumour. ""That also tells us where the tumour might be heading as well,"" said Dr Turajlic. The researchers were able to classify kidney cancer into one of three broad categories: Born to be bad Benign Intermediate The ""born to be bad"" tumours had rapid and extensive mutations and would grow so quickly they are likely to have spread round the body before they are even detected. Surgery to remove the original tumour may delay the use of drugs that can slow the disease. The benign tumours are at the complete opposite and are likely to grow so slowly they may never be a problem to patients and could just be monitored. The intermediate tumours were likely to initially spread to just one other location in the body and could be treated with surgery. Michael Malley, 72, from London, took part in the trial at the Royal Marsden Hospital after being diagnosed with kidney cancer. He said: ""Clearly studies like these are really important for understanding how kidney cancer evolves over time, and I hope this one day leads to better treatments for patients like me."" There is still the challenge of figuring out how best to tailor treatments to each tumour type, and even how to perform such tests in a hospital rather than a research lab. The tools used in this study are being investigated in other cancers, including lung cancer. Dr Turajlic says: ""We've no doubt they will be applicable to other types of cancer."" The studies also revealed that the earliest mutations that lead to kidney cancer were happening up to half a century before the cancer was detected. Sir Harpal Kumar, the chief executive of Cancer Research UK, said the study was ""groundbreaking"". He added: ""For years we've grappled with the fact that patients with seemingly very similar diagnoses nevertheless have very different outcomes. ""We're learning from the history of these tumours to better predict the future. ""This is profoundly important because hopefully we can predict the path a cancer will take for each individual patient and that will drive us towards more personalised treatment.""

Low-skill jobs 'rebadged as apprenticeships',"Fast food giants, coffee shops and retailers are relabelling low-skilled jobs as apprenticeships and gaining subsidies for training, a report says. The study by centre-right think tank Reform says many firms have rebranded existing roles after being obliged to contribute cash to on-the-job training. It adds that 40% of government-approved apprenticeship standards do not meet a traditional definition of them. The government says ""quality"" is at the heart of its apprenticeship reforms. As part of the changes, it introduced an apprenticeship levy on organisations paying more than Â£3m in salaries a year. They have to pay 0.5% of their wages total into a ""digital account"" held by HMRC. They then ""spend"" these contributions on apprenticeship training delivered by registered providers. They can also get back up to 90% of the cost of training. But they are also entitled to pay apprentices lower than the standard minimum wage. The minimum rates range from Â£3.70 an hour for anyone in their first year of an apprenticeship to Â£7.38 Thereport,externalsays: ""As part of the government's wider package of reforms to apprenticeships, groups of employers came together to write the new 'apprenticeship standards'. ""Some used this opportunity to generate high-quality standards, but others appear to be simply rebadging low-quality, low-skill and often low-wage roles as 'apprenticeships' instead."" In 2013, the government said apprenticeships had to be skilled roles, requiring substantial and sustained training of at least 12 months, leading to full competency and should provide the apprentice with transferrable skills in an occupation. But a quick glance at the government's official apprenticeships website shows many high street firms advertising for apprentices in what appear to be unskilled roles. For example, KFC is advertising for an apprentice hospitality team member. The advert describes the apprenticeship as ""a structured, learner and employer-focused development programme designed to create opportunities for lifelong knowledge, skills and behaviours"". But the role is described as cooking ""fries"" and other products and serving customers front of house, or cooking and assembling KFC products, while maintaining clean, sanitary working conditions. It says training is based around day-to-day duties, but will also involve one-to-one interactions with a specialised trainer every four to six weeks. KFC said the apprenticeship existed before the levy was introduced and met all the key standards, and that the firm paid more than the minimum apprenticeship rates. Coffee giant Starbucks is advertising for hospitality team member barista apprentices on the official website to make and serve coffee in its branches. A spokesman for Starbucks said: ""Our apprenticeship programme was established over five years ago and is offered in partnership with the specialist training provider, Remit Training. ""Remit lead a clearly differentiated and exclusive bespoke training programme for our apprentices, which includes meeting the 20% off-the-job training requirement, and they carry out a number of different training and development steps for baristas who are part of the programme."" Tom Richmond, senior research fellow at Reform, said service sector apprenticeships could be of high quality, but many of these being approved did not fit the traditional or international definition of an apprenticeship. He compared British apprenticeship standards with those for the hospitality sector in Germany which, he said, cover a much broader range of skills and competencies. A Department for Education spokeswoman said it wanted to see people of all ages and backgrounds getting the excellent training they need to succeed in a wide range of jobs, and that this was why it was changing the apprenticeship system. She added: ""Our reforms have fundamentally changed what apprenticeships are, as we made it a requirement that all apprenticeships must be real paid jobs lasting for a minimum of 12 months, with at least 20% off-the-job training. ""Quality is at the heart of our reforms, and the apprenticeship levy is an important part of that - creating sustainable investment in skills training. ""We're pleased to see an increase in people starting our new, higher-quality apprenticeship standards in a whole range of industries from nuclear to fashion, law, banking and defence. ""These apprenticeships are designed by employers themselves, to give people and businesses the skills they really need."" Have you worked as an apprentice in these types of roles?

"Woman jailed for slamming dog on patioAn RSPCA inspector said the attack on terrier Edie ""turns my stomach"".","In video footage shown in court, Joanne Hosking can be seen slamming Edie into the patio A woman who beat her dog and slammed it onto a patio has been jailed for 18 weeks. Joanne Hosking, 41, admitted causing unnecessary suffering to Edie, a terrier-type dog, in July 2017. Hosking and husband Christopher, 45, of St Ives, Cornwall, also admitted failing to provide veterinary care at Bodmin Magistrates' Court. The RSPCA said the ""innocent dog"" was picked up to shoulder height and slammed down twice. There's more on this story on BBC Devon and Cornwall Local Live The Hoskings have been banned from keeping animals for life and ordered to pay Â£1,450. Christopher Hoskings was also electronically tagged and put under a curfew. Christopher and Joanne Hosking admitted failing to provide veterinary care The court was shown footage of Edie being beaten and limping and moaning around the garden. Veterinary evidence showed the dog had a dislocated hip for seven days and would have been in considerable pain. It also needed an operation to remove part of the joint. RSPCA inspector Paul Kempson, said: ""I've been doing this job for 22 years and I honestly thought I'd seen everything that I could possibly see. ""The number of times that I've had to sit through that video and watch it, when I see that little 12-month-old innocent dog being picked up to shoulder height and slammed down onto concrete paving slabs twice and hearing the thud as she makes contact - it actually turns my stomach every time I see it."" The court was told Edie had been re-homed with a veterinary nurse and had now recovered.

BBC Cliff coverage 'invasion of privacy',"Lawyers for Sir Cliff Richard have told the High Court the BBC's coverage of a police raid on the singer's home was a ""very serious invasion"" of his privacy. A helicopter was used in the report to show officers searching the 77-year-old star's Berkshire apartment after a claim of historical sexual assault. Sir Cliff was not charged with any offence and says he is suing over ""profound and long-lasting damage"". The BBC says its coverage in August 2014 was in the public interest. Its reports of the raid were shown in court where Sir Cliff, who was sitting with his solicitor, is taking action against the corporation for the misuse of private information and breaking data protection rules. The BBC said it had been given information about a police investigation into a serious criminal offence and had a duty to pass on the information to the public. Gavin Millar QC for the corporation said it was the BBC's case that Sir Cliff could not have had a ""reasonable expectation of privacy"" in the situation, even though he may have hoped for that. Cliff Richard case 'likely to have huge impact' In a written statement, Sir Cliff's barrister, Justin Rushbrooke QC, said the BBC used TV cameras to ""spy into someone's home"" as South Yorkshire Police carried out their raid. He said: ""It is hard to encapsulate in words the sense of panic and powerlessness that must have been induced in him on 14 August 2014 when he realised that the BBC were relaying, instantaneously and indiscriminately around the world, highly sensitive and damaging information concerning himself - all based upon an allegation of serious criminal conduct which he knew to be entirely false."" The judge, Mr Justice Mann, was told by lawyers for South Yorkshire Police that they had agreed to pay Sir Cliff Â£400,000 to settle a claim he brought against the force, and to cover some of his legal bills. Mr Rushbrooke said the BBC acted in a ""highly intrusive"" manner and Sir Cliff was entitled to ""very substantial"" damages or compensation for the ""flagrant way"" it went about ""breaching his rights"". He said: ""The fact and the details of the investigation which the BBC published to the world at large, along with the video footage of his apartment being searched, were private information and there was no public interest in the disclosure of this information to the millions of viewers and website readers around the world to whom it was published."" Sketch of Sir Cliff Richard at High Court on 12 April 2018 By Lucy Manning, BBC News Inside Court 15 the television screens played the news reports showing police searching Sir Cliff Richard's house. The voice of the BBC reporter told viewers that day in August 2014 that officers were investigating the singer after an allegation of historical sex abuse. Of course, Sir Cliff was never arrested or charged. As the pictures played in court Sir Cliff, sitting next to his solicitor, at times closed his eyes to avoid looking at the screens. He is set to go into the witness box and give evidence to the court on Friday. Mr Rushbrooke say BBC journalist Dan Johnson had received a tip-off about the raid from a Metropolitan Police source working in Operation Yewtree, the investigation into allegations of historical sex offences. ""This was a case of a journalist making use of information that must have been leaked improperly, indeed unlawfully, by someone within a highly sensitive police investigation,"" he said. Mr Rushbrooke added South Yorkshire Police ""made clear"" that Sir Cliff was not going to be named in a public statement, but the BBC took the decision to name him and film the raid. He said the BBC news team were ""desperate to be the first media organisation to break their story, and this desire not to be scooped was the predominant concern"". ""For strong public policy reasons, persons who are under investigation but have not been charged with any offence should not be publicly named other than in exceptional circumstances - circumstances which were not present in this case,"" the barrister said. ""Moreover, even if there had been some public interest in the fact that the claimant was under investigation, the way that the BBC went about publishing the 'story' was so disproportionate, and so intrusive, as to render it unlawful."" Lawyers representing the BBC told the judge that the police raid was of ""legitimate public interest"". The BBC's defence was also outlined in a written statement presented to the court. It said journalists had respected Sir Cliff's rights as ""the suspect"" and the ""presumption of innocence"". Addressing the court, Gavin Millar said the case came amid public discussion about a number of prominent male figures in the broadcasting industry being investigated for historical offences. He said the BBC had exercised the right to freedom of expression to report the allegation being investigated by police against Sir Cliff -  a sexual offence against a boy under the age of 16. It did not overstep the mark, Mr Millar added. He said the coverage concentrated on the facts of the police search in Sunningdale and chose not to report certain features of the investigation.

Crackdown on false holiday illness claims,"Legal costs for package holiday sickness cases will be fixed under new rules aimed at deterring false claims. Similar controls are in place for other personal injury claims, but they will now be extended to cases when holidaymakers seek compensation. The travel industry says claims have mushroomed in recent years despite illness in resorts declining. Travel agents are now calling on the government to ban cold calls encouraging people to make a claim. The Association of British Travel Agents (Abta) said there were about 35,000 claims over holiday sickness in 2016, a 500% rise since 2013. The industry said the total cost of all claims was Â£240m in 2016 and the growth in cases risked raising holiday prices for all. Travellers being encouraged to fake illness Thomas Cook wins fake holiday sickness case It said that many tour operators were put off challenging cases in court owing to the potential of spiralling legal costs. In turn, this is said to have prompted claims management companies to encourage tourists to seek holiday sickness compensation. The government asked the Civil Procedure Rule Committee, which is responsible for setting rules on legal costs, to consider bringing package holiday claims under the same rules as personal injury claims. The committee has approved that move and the limits on legal costs will take effect in the coming weeks. Justice Minister Rory Stewart said those claiming compensation when they had not been being sick on holiday was fraud. ""This damages the travel industry and risks driving up costs for holidaymakers. This behaviour also tarnishes the reputation of British people abroad. That is why we are introducing measures to crack down on those who engage in this dishonest practice,"" he said. Mark Tanzer, chief executive of the Association of Travel Agents said: ""Closing the legal loophole before the summer should lead to a reduction in the number of false claims. ""We encourage the government to keep this matter under review and continue to pursue a ban on cold calling by claims management companies in relation to sickness claims."" Julie Vallance, legal director at Lime Solicitors ""As soon as a holidaymaker suffers from sickness while on holiday abroad, and if that holidaymaker really believes that it is because of, say, food poisoning from the hotel, he or she should: Report the illness to the holiday representative Ensure that a written record of the complaint is recorded and ask for a copy Seek medical attention and obtain a copy of the doctor's record Keep any receipts for any medication purchased and keep receipts for any taxi fares incurred in seeking medical advice Speak to other holidaymakers in the same hotel to establish whether or not others have also suffered from the same or similar sickness and get their names and addresses ""A package holiday sickness claim, like any other personal injury claim will only succeed if it can be proven that the individual suffered as a result of negligence, on the balance of probabilities. Solicitors will only receive costs on successful claims.""

Kleeneze retailer in administration,"One of Britain's oldest home shopping companies has gone into administration. Kleeneze, best known for selling household and beauty products through its network of door-to-door sellers, said it had ceased trading on Thursday and 140 jobs are at risk. But there is also a question mark over the future of 5,000 independent distributors who sell the products. Administrators FRP Advisory is seeking a buyer in a last ditch attempt to save the 95-year old firm. Joint administrator David Acland said: ""Kleeneze has performed well over the years and has a strong network of independent sales distributors. ""Unfortunately, tough trading conditions have resulted in the business entering administration. ""The business suffered from operational issues after its move to the Heywood distribution site earlier in 2017. ""There were logistics challenges and IT issues that took six months to resolve, which resulted in significant lost sales,"" Mr Acland said. Kleeneze's self-employed distributors deliver catalogues throughout in the UK and Ireland, earning cash or rewards for every sale they make - either at the doorstep or through their own online shop. These sellers are a mixture of self-employed sole traders and partnerships, and many work for Kleeneze alongside other jobs. The company employs 69 permanent staff at its head office in Accrington, Lancashire, and a further 71 at its warehouse in Heywood, Greater Manchester. Usdaw, the trade union for Kleeneze staff, said it was seeking urgent meetings with the administrators in a bid to protect jobs. Annette Bott, an Usdaw area organiser, said: ""This is clearly a difficult and upsetting time for the 140 staff based in Accrington and Heywood. ""We are pressing the administrators to find a buyer for the company who will protect jobs and keep the business going. In the meantime, we are providing our members with the support, advice and representation they need.""

Swedish Academy head quits Nobel body,"Sara Danius is the latest member of the Swedish Academy to step down The head of the Swedish Academy - the prestigious body that awards the Nobel Prize in Literature - has stepped down in the wake of a sexual abuse scandal. The organisation has been criticised for its handling of a probe into the alleged sexual misconduct of a man married to one of its members. ""It has already affected the Nobel Prize quite severely and that is quite a big problem,"" said Professor Sara Danius, as she stood down. The accused denies all the allegations. ""It was the wish of the Academy that I should leave my role as Permanent Secretary,"" Ms Danius told reporters on Thursday. ""I have made this decision with immediate effect."" Last November, inspired by the #MeToo campaign,18 women made allegations of sexual assault and harassment against Jean-Claude Arnault,external, the husband of Academy member Katarina Frostenson. After the Academy voted against removing Ms Frostenson last week, three of its members Klas Ostergren, Kjell Espmark and Peter Englund withdrew from the 18-person committee in protest, Swedish media reported. While they cannot technically resign from their positions, which are for life, they can stop participating in the Academy's activities. Is #meToo changing Hollywood? 'MeToo' and the scale of sexual abuse The Nobel body had cut all ties and funding to Mr Arnault, who runs a cultural club in Stockholm, shortly after the allegations came to light. The Swedish Academy said at the time that it had potentially broken its own rules regulating conflict of interest and appointed a legal firm to investigate its committee members' links with Mr Arnault. His lawyer told Reuters that he rejected all the claims against him. Mr Arnault - a cultural figure in Sweden - did not attend last year's Nobel Prize banquet following the allegations against him ""Jean-Claude Arnault rejects all claims of criminal activity and he rejects other allegations that have been made against him,"" Bjorn Hurtig said in an email. None of the sexual misconduct allegations had been reported to the police when the scandal broke last year, but state prosecutors opened a preliminary investigation into the incidents. Last month, they said some parts of their probe had been shelved due to a lack of evidence and because the statute of limitations had passed for some of the allegations. However, the investigation related to some incidents was continuing, prosecutors confirmed. Is #meToo changing Hollywood?

US model confronts Cosby over rape claim,"The former model claims Mr Cosby raped her during an encounter in his hotel room in Lake Tahoe, Nevada Former US model Janice Dickinson has confronted comedian Bill Cosby in court, alleging he drugged and raped her in a hotel room in 1982. She ""wanted to punch him in the face"" after the alleged attack and was left in physical pain, she told the court. Mr Cosby is facing a second trial on allegations he drugged and sexually assaulted a former colleague, and has been accused by more than 50 women. The judge has allowed five women to take the stand during the retrial. Mr Cosby, 80, is only criminally accused of assaulting one woman - former Temple university employee Andrea Constand - due to statute of limitation laws. But Judge Steven O'Neill has ruled that five other accusers can serve as ""prior bad acts"" witnesses, which the prosecution says will establish a pattern of misconduct. ""I wanted to hit him, wanted to punch him in the face,"" Ms Dickinson, 63, told the courtroom in Norristown, Pennsylvania. ""I felt anger, was humiliated, disgusted, ashamed."" Cosby accuser 'drowsy for four days' Cosby paid assault accuser $3.4m in 2006 Ms Dickinson, who was 27 at the time, said she had flown from Bali to meet the famous comedian at a hotel room in Lake Tahoe, Nevada, after he promised to help with her acting and singing aspirations. The former reality television star testified Mr Cosby offered her a blue pill that he said would help with discomfort from menstrual cramps. ""He smelled like cigars and espresso and his body odour,"" she said. ""I couldn't move, I felt like I was rendered motionless."" ""Here was America's dad on top of me, happily married man with five children and how very, very wrong it was,"" she said. She said she confronted the comedian the next day about the incident and asked him why he did it. He allegedly responded: ""You're crazy,"" she said. Ms Dickinson said she did not go to police because she thought it would destroy her career. Mr Cosby's lawyers pointed out she authored a memoir in 2002 that made no mention of the assault, and read a passage in which she wrote she had never entered Mr Cosby's room and took two quaaludes in her own room. Ms Dickinson told the court she was advised to leave the assault out of the book for legal reasons and felt pressured to do so because she needed the money. She added she ""wasn't under oath"" when she wrote the book. On Monday it emerged that Mr Cosby paid Ms Constand almost $3.4m (Â£2.4m) in a civil settlement in 2006. The star of The Cosby Show was once the biggest name in US television, synonymous with wholesome family entertainment, and a Hollywood trailblazer for African Americans.

Royal visitor for recovering Prince Philip,"Princess Anne says her father is ""on good form"" after visiting him in hospital Princess Anne has visited her father, the Duke of Edinburgh, at a London hospital as he recovers from his hip replacement operation. The Princess Royal spent about 50 minutes in the hospital and afterwards said her father was ""on good form"". She is the first family member to visit Prince Philip since he had the planned procedure at the private King Edward VII's Hospital on 4 April. The Duke of Edinburgh, 96, retired from royal duties last August. His hip problem came to light after his absence from the Easter service at Windsor and he was admitted to hospital on 3 April. He had also missed two other recent events at Windsor Castle - the Royal Maundy Service at St George's Chapel on 29 March, and a parade on 22 March to mark Prince Andrew's appointment as Colonel of the Grenadier Guards. Buckingham Palace said in a statement following the surgery that the duke was ""comfortable and in good spirits"". Prince Philip's decades of royal duty Philip honoured on wedding anniversary The duke announced his retirement in May 2017, after decades of supporting the Queen, as well as attending events for his own charities and organisations. A month later he was admitted to the private King Edward VII's Hospital as ""a precautionary measure"" following an infection arising from a pre-existing condition. Prince Philip carried out his last solo engagement in August 2017 He attended the Christmas Day service at Sandringham with the Queen and other members of the Royal Family His final solo engagement was on 2 August last year, when he reviewed a parade of Royal Marines outside Buckingham Palace in his capacity as Captain General of the corps. But he has since appeared several times at engagements alongside the Queen. The surgery comes ahead of a busy time for the royal family, with the Duchess of Cambridge due to give birth to her third child this month, and the wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle in May.

Council boss abuse denial 'defies belief',"Richard Farnell was in charge of Rochdale Council between 1986 and 1992 A former council leader's claim he was unaware of child sex abuse in Rochdale ""defies belief"", a report has found. An independent inquiry,externalsaid it was ""shameful"" that Richard Farnell ""refused to accept responsibility for young lives blighted"" in the town. More than 40 men claimed they were abused at Cambridge House hostel, Knowl View school and other places between the early 1960s and mid-1990s. Mr Farnell said he was ""shocked"" by the findings and had ""told the truth"". The report said he ""lied to the inquiry during his evidence"". Pupils at Knowl View were also sexually exploited in the town centre, the bus station and at public toilets across the road from the borough council's offices over a 20-year period. Mr Farnell, who lost his council seat in 1992 but returned to the post in 2014, said: ""There is clear evidence that I was not informed about Knowl View during my time as leader."" He added that a two-year police investigation found ""no evidence whatsoever"" that he was involved in any cover-up. Read more about the report and other news from north-west England Daniel Wolstencroft, from the Victims and Survivors Consultative Panel for the inquiry, has called for action to be taken against Mr Farnell. ""In my own personal opinion he has got blood on his hands, [because] he denies knowing about the abuse,"" he said. ""So for me he was complicit in the abuse. He needs holding to account."" Cyril Smith represented Rochdale in Parliament from 1972 to 1992 The Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA) report also found ""valuable opportunities were lost"" in 1998 and 1999 to charge and prosecute the late Liberal MP Cyril Smith, who was accused of carrying out abuse in the town which he represented from 1972 to 1992. There was a misguided ""unwillingness to consider that someone in a position of public prominence might be capable of perpetrating sexual abuse"", it said. Boys at Cambridge House boys hostel, where Smith was honorary secretary, said he spanked their bare bottoms and carried out intrusive medical examinations despite not being qualified to do so. Before he died aged 82 in 2010 Smith, who acted as a governor for several Rochdale schools including Knowl View, was the subject of sex abuse accusations and investigations but never faced trial and received a knighthood in 1988. Cyril Smith's victims 'not believed' Leader alleges lie over abuse report note Paedophile 'camped outside school' Prof Alexis Jay, the chair of the inquiry, said she was ""deeply disturbed at the evidence of extensive abuse and the institutional responses to that abuse"". ""Many of those who testified to their abuse have never had the opportunity to seek justice through the courts,"" she added. Rochdale's Knowl View residential school closed in the mid-1990s The report, which was published on Thursday, also found authorities in Rochdale showed a ""total lack of urgency"" to address the sexual exploitation of boys at Knowl View, who were regarded as ""authors of their own abuse"". The panel said Mr Farnell came across as ""bullish, self opinionated and unyielding"" while giving evidence to the inquiry, which heard three weeks of evidence in October. The Labour Party confirmed it had suspended the former leader, who was still in office when he gave evidence but later stood down. Paul Rowen, who was leader of Rochdale Council between 1992-96, also ""bore considerable responsibility"" for the school and ""turned a blind eye to the problems"", the report added. Mr Rowen said he ""made a mistake"" for which he was ""terribly sorry"" when he did not read a full report on Knowl View when he took over. ""Those young people should have had counselling, they should have had support and there should have been a full inquiry,"" he said. This video can not be played  One victim, speaking anonymously about allegations of abuse at the hands of Cyril Smith, said: ""There was this man there who I can only describe as enormous. ""He asked me to take my pants down and turn around and face the wall. He started running his hands all over my body and he started bringing his hands up my side and my legs. ""I'm 70 now and I'm still feeling the pain and suffering as I did."" The IICSA concluded that from 1989 onwards the police, Rochdale Council's social services and education departments, as well as staff at Knowl View, knew youngsters were being subjected to sexual exploitation for money in public toilets. It ruled there was no ""deliberate cover-up"" by the authorities involved but said instead there was a ""careless and wholly inadequate response"". Knowl View had failed in its basic function to keep children safe from harm, the report said, with both staff and older boys carrying out abuse. Some boys were trafficked to other towns for the same purpose, and at one stage a convicted paedophile gained access to the school and attacked boys there over two nights. Martin Digan blew the whistle on allegations at Knowl View school in the 1990s Martin Digan, a former social worker who blew the whistle on the allegations in the 1990s, said the report provided ""vindication that what the victims said in the first instance and what I said in the first instance actually happened"". Rochdale MP Tony Lloyd described the abuse as a ""national tragedy"" and called for ""a national package of compensation"" for victims of sexual abuse ""across the piste"". He added: ""We can't go back there but we do need to recognise that victims still are suffering these years on."" Steve Rumbelow, chief executive of Rochdale Council, said the authority acknowledged its failures and the consequences for the children involved were ""exceptionally serious"". ""The council has apologised and acknowledged that children were failed. I repeat that apology today and say again that we are truly sorry,"" he said. Greater Manchester Police said the force would consult with the inquiry to establish whether any criminal offences require investigation. Assistant Chief Constable Debbie Ford said: ""We have fully co-operated throughout and we acknowledge [the report's] findings. ""This is a comprehensive report and we will now take time to fully understand the outcomes and any potential learnings.""

Cabinet agrees 'need for action' in Syria,"In April 2017 the US launched cruise missiles at a Syrian airbase after a chemical weapons attack Cabinet ministers have agreed ""on the need to take action"" in Syria to ""deter the further use of chemical weapons"", Downing Street has said. Ministers at a cabinet meeting said it was ""highly likely"" the Assad regime was responsible for a suspected chemical attack. They agreed that the use of chemical weapons must not ""go unchallenged"". But Transport Minister Jo Johnson later stressed: ""There has been no decision to take military action at this point."" No details of UK involvement in any military action in Syria were mentioned in the Downing Street statement. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has accused the government of ""waiting for instructions"" from US President Donald Trump and said military action was unlikely to solve the situation in Syria. He said: ""More bombing, more killing, more war will not save life. It will just take more lives and spawn the war elsewhere."" Medical sources say dozens of people were killed, including children, during the alleged toxic bombing of the formerly rebel-held town of Douma, in the Eastern Ghouta region. Russia warns of 'dangerous' escalation over Syria What can Western military intervention achieve? Syria 'chemical attack': What we know President Trump spoke to the prime minister on Thursday evening, and the pair agreed that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad had ""established a pattern of dangerous behaviour in relation to the use of chemical weapons"". A statement from Downing Street added: ""They agreed to keep working closely together on the international response."" President Trump is expected to speak to French President Emmanuel Macron about what form action could take, with the White House saying ""no final decision has been made"". BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said it was understood the UK was planning a genuinely joint effort with the US and France, rather than playing a supporting role. Sources say the PM is prepared to take action against the Assad regime without first seeking parliamentary consent. Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson, Home Secretary Amber Rudd and Environment Secretary Michael Gove leave the meeting at No 10 There have been calls from opposition parties and some Conservative MPs for Parliament to have a vote beforehand. Labour's shadow home secretary Diane Abbott told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""It would be outrageous for the government not to bring military action in Syria to Parliament - for Parliament to have a vote... ""The reason they're not doing it is they are frightened they'll lose the vote."" Mrs May has said ""all the indications"" are that the Syrian regime of president Bashar al-Assad, which denies mounting a chemical attack, was responsible for the alleged attack in the formerly rebel-held town of Douma. During Thursday's cabinet meeting called to discuss the UK response, she described it as ""shocking and barbaric"" and said it was a ""further example of the erosion of international law in relation to the use of chemical weapons, which was deeply concerning to us all"". This video can not be played Should Parliament have a vote on Syria strikes? By Chris Buckler, BBC US correspondent Theresa May and Donald Trump spoke on the phone late on Thursday The diplomatic discussions are starting to feel like part of a waiting game. The White House insists that final decisions have still to be made. However, in their phone call, President Trump and Mrs May agreed it was vital action was taken to deter President Assad's forces from using chemical weapons. Evidence is still being gathered, but US officials are understood to have results from blood and urine samples that indicate chlorine and a nerve agent were used in the Syrian town of Douma. But they privately admit they can't be 100% sure. And with Russia threatening retaliation - and warning of the risk of some kind of conflict with the US - there is pressure to develop a wider strategy, alongside any plan for military strikes. Downing Street said the cabinet had ""agreed it was vital that the use of chemical weapons did not go unchallenged"" and ""on the need to take action to alleviate humanitarian distress and to deter the further use of chemical weapons by the Assad regime"". ""Cabinet agreed the prime minister should continue to work with allies in the United States and France to coordinate an international response,"" the statement added. This video can not be played ""Like the day of judgement"": Survivors recount the horrors of the 2013 Ghouta attack Sir Mark Lyall Grant, national security adviser to Theresa May until 2017, said he would advise the PM to join with the US if a ""credible plan"" was put forward by its military. He told BBC's Newsnight: ""A very important red line has been crossed by the use of chemical weapons by the Assad regime, and we, the United Kingdom, have a very strong national interest in defending this rules-based international order. ""We shouldn't just rely on the Americans to do that for us. We have as strong an interest as they do."" Syria decision looms for May Do MPs need to approve UK action in Syria? Senior figures from Russia, which provides military support to the Syrian regime, have warned of a Russian response to a US attack.

Macron's 'red lines',"Emmanuel Macron says he and his allies will decide on a response to the presumed chemical weapon attack in Syria""at a time of our choosing"".With the French president now talking daily to his American counterpart, Donald Trump, what role is France likely to play in any international response? A year ago, Russian President Vladimir Putin stood grim-faced in the opulence of France's Versailles Palace, as a newly-elected President Macron announced that the use of chemical weapons in Syria was a ""red line"" for France, and ""would result in reprisal and an immediate response"". Now Mr Macron - who likes to be seen as a president who keeps his word - is facing the test of what ""reprisal"" actually means. Benjamin Hautecouverture, from France's Foundation for Strategic Research, says Mr Macron could still choose to respond diplomatically, ""by persuading Moscow to ban its Syrian ally from using chemical weapons again"". Syria: What can Western action achieve? Macron-Trump: An unlikely friendship is born The meteoric rise of Macron But former US President Barack Obama was derided in France for not following through on his own ""red line"" after Syrian attacks five years ago - and Mr Macron is keen not to suffer the same criticism. ""When you fix red lines,"" he told a French newspaper last year, ""if you can't enforce them, you decide to be weak."" Strength is an important part of Mr Macron's bid to project French influence on the world stage - and a key element, too, of his new political friendship with his US counterpart, Donald Trump. ""Macron is one of the few European leaders - even world leaders - who understand how to handle Trump,"" says French journalist Philippe Labro. ""France has proved to Trump and his boys in the State Department that this is a country that's waking up again, with a strong president - and Trump is impressed by strong people. ""Trump sees our work in Africa and how we deal with conflicts. He knows we have planes in the Middle East ready to strike."" Emmanuel Macron and Vladimir Putin oppose one another over the Assad regime From the first time they met, the young French leader was keen to establish a relationship of equals with his US counterpart, showing that he could match Mr Trump's handshake, if not his military capabilities. Now, Mr Macron says, the two men speak ""every day"", and few here believe that France would choose to carry out military action in Syria alone. But Joseph Downing, a specialist in Franco-US relations at the London School of Economics, says France will need to swallow the role of junior partner. ""[Their] close military co-operation will not be a 50/50 balance,"" he says. ""France is playing the role that Britain did in the Iraq invasion; they're a symbolic partner for the US to say it's not acting alone."" Macron: Trump not a classical politician French president threatens Syria strikes Former French general Dominique Trinquand says it wouldn't make sense for France to act without its allies, and that they would likely share out targets. ""They could hit a number of airbases in Syria, which would send a punitive message to [Syrian President] Bashar [al-Assad],"" he says. ""Or they could launch a greater operation, aimed at destabilising the regime."" Emmanuel Macron is keen not to repeat what he sees as France's mistakes in Libya Mr Macron has said France could target stockpiles of chemical weapons in Syria but, Mr Hautecouverture says, such targets may not be plentiful, or easy to find. ""All the declared stockpiles have already been dismantled,"" he explains. ""And when the regime is using chlorine, it's totally useless because you have chlorine everywhere. ""The message needs to deter the Syrian president from using chemical weapons in future; so the targets could be aeroplanes, helicopters, airports, command centres, or even [locations] very close to the physical person of Assad."" Whatever targets may be discussed with his allies, Mr Macron is likely to be wary of a deeper strategic campaign in Syria.  His wish to project French power is coupled with an unwillingness to repeat what he sees as mistakes made by his predecessors in Libya. ""I don't want a failed state,"" he said last year. ""France didn't take part in the Iraq war and that was right. And France was wrong to take part in the war in Libya in the way it did. ""What was the result of those interventions?  Failed states where terrorist groups prospered.  I don't want that in Syria."" Dr Downing says Mr Macron is facing a ""delicate balance to castrate the regime but not topple it"". ""He's trying to create an imperialistic image of his presidency,"" Dr Downing says, ""but he doesn't want to be seen as going in alongside Trump and creating a bigger problem [in Syria].  He doesn't want to worsen the migrant crisis or increase the threat of jihadist attacks at home."" Mr Hautecouverture agrees. ""The French population has not been prepared for a long-term strategic campaign,"" he said. ""This is not the beginning of a war.""

Do MPs have to approve action?,"This video can not be played The US president has said ""nothing's off the table"" - so what options are on the table? As Theresa May weighs up what role - if any - the UK should have in military action against Syria, the question of parliamentary approval will need addressing. So far this week the prime minister has side-stepped it. Much will depend on the scale and timing of the missile strike the United States seems poised to launch in response to the apparent chemical weapons attack last week. Theresa May certainly could agree to launch UK missiles from a Royal Navy submarine or RAF jets without MPs giving the green light first. Because, while the recent practice has been for governments to win the backing of parliament before UK military action it is only a convention to do so and a recent one at that. In March 2003 the Blair government's move to secure the approval of MPs in advance of the Iraq invasion was the first time the decision to go to war had been given to parliament. That established a precedent that has been followed since and Theresa May will be acutely aware of how events played out. Syria 'chemical attack': What we know Why is there a war in Syria? Trump says missiles 'will be coming' Of most relevance today is the Commons vote David Cameron held in August 2013 on a motion agreeing to potential UK military action against President Assad in Syria following the use of chemical weapons. MPs were recalled from their summer recess, a debate was held and the government lost the division by 13 votes. Labour opposed the motion but so did 30 Tory MPs and 9 Lib Dems - who were then part of the coalition. The vote was a political and diplomatic disaster for David Cameron and the US had to shelve its plans for military action. Five years on, there is no chance Theresa May will risk a re-run of that. If she does seek parliamentary approval she will only do so if she knows she can get it. Mrs May might find other votes more encouraging. For instance, in 2011 the Commons voted overwhelmingly in favour of military action in Libya by 557 to 13. Crucially, that vote came soon after UK, US and France carried out air strikes against the Libyan forces to enforce a UN-mandated no-fly zone. MPs are currently away on recess and there is no sign a parliamentary recall is brewing. So if the UK does decide to take part in US-led action in Syria it is possible MPs are asked to vote after the missiles have been launched. Two other votes are relevant. In September 2014 MPs voted by 524 to 43 to sanction UK air strikes against Islamic State forces in Iraq. In December 2015 David Cameron returned to the Commons to seek authorisation to extend the strikes against IS into Syrian territory. Jeremy Corbyn instructed Labour MPs to vote against the motion but 66 of his own MPs, including front benchers, voted with the government and the motion was passed by 397 votes to 223. May: Syria attack 'cannot go unchallenged' James Landale: Syria decision looms for May March 2003: Tony Blair wins backing for Iraq war despite revolt,external So how might House of Commons arithmetic add up if Theresa May took a new motion to MPs asking them to approve military action against President Assad now? Remember, Parliament has never given its backing to military action against the Syrian government, only to air strikes against Islamic State forces based in the country. Clearly a lot would depend on the wording and scope of the motion. While there is cross-party revulsion at the apparent use of chemical weapons in Syria many MPs are likely to have concerns about the ramifications that could follow military action, not least a possible confrontation with Russia. Unlike David Cameron, Theresa May is running a minority government with a working majority of just 13. All votes are potentially dicey. Of those 30 Tory MPs who voted against military action in 2013, 23 are still in the Commons. It is almost impossible to imagine Jeremy Corbyn instructing his MPs to vote for air strikes. But it is also a safe bet a section of the parliamentary Labour Party would ignore him again. These are some of the political considerations Theresa May will be mulling over. Jeremy Corbyn has already said parliament must have a vote. Parliament ""should always be given a say on any military action"", he said on Wednesday. This video can not be played Suspected chemical attack is 'barbaric' - May The Iraq vote in 2003 set a precedent and the UK's experience of the conflict that followed frames this argument. But it is not parliament's right to decide when Britain goes to war. The ability for a prime minister to take military action is one of their royal prerogatives. A government is allowed to use that power on behalf of the Crown. Over the last decade or so ministers have thought about introducing legislation that would enshrine that convention in law but the idea of a War Powers Act has always been abandoned. Governments do not want to surrender their power to deploy Britain's armed forces and they don't want their hands tied by parliament. In the end, Theresa May will have to make a political judgement. One of the hardest a prime minister can face.

Firepower of key countries,"This video can not be played Trump has said ""nothing's off the table"" - so what is on the table? US President Donald Trump has told Russia to ""get ready"" for a missile strike on its ally Syria in response to a recent alleged chemical attack near Damascus. Indications suggest that the type of strike being planned by Washington, with the possible assistance of the UK and France, will involve weapons launched from warships or submarines at long range. Any aircraft used would be either firing weapons from beyond the reach of Syria's surface-to-air defence systems or be drones that can be remote-controlled. Russian officials have warned that missiles will be shot down and their ""launch sites"" targeted. But what weapons - that we know of - do the main players have at their disposal? And how might Russia and Syria respond? What can Western military intervention achieve? Are we heading for a third world war? Syria 'chemical attack': What we know The US, whose guided-missile destroyer the USS Donald Cook is already in the Mediterranean, is likely to target chemical facilities in Syria with its cruise missiles. Such action would avoid the risk of its fighter jets being downed. A year ago, two US Navy destroyers in the eastern Mediterranean Sea launched a total of 59 Tomahawk Land Attack Missiles (TLAMs) at the Shayrat airbase in Syria's Homs province. Washington said the airbase was used to store chemical weapons used in a deadly attack on a rebel-held town just 72 hours before its military response. The Tomahawks used have a small cross-section, fly at low altitudes and are very difficult to detect. They also emit little heat so they cannot be picked up by infrared detection. Why was Shayrat airbase bombed? Israel blamed for latest attack on airfield The US Navy is also carrying a sizeable fleet of fighter jets on carriers in the Gulf, although it is unlikely to risk entering Syrian airspace immediately. The largest US military base in the Middle East is in Qatar, where F-16 and A10 aircraft, also known as Warthogs, are located. These can be scrambled relatively quickly. The F-16 has a reputation as one of the most reliable, manoeuvrable and effective military aircraft in the world. It has a range of about 2,000 miles (3,220km), which allows it to remain in combat zones longer than other aircraft. The Americans also have long-range subsonic B-52 bombers, which they have deployed and used on targets in the region before. In Kobane, a small Kurdish town at the Turkish border in northern Syria, the US has previously used an air base to deliver troops and equipment with C130 and C17 military transport aircraft. The cavernous interior of a US C17 transport aircraft The vehicles are large enough to carry smaller aircraft such as helicopters and can be used to refuel combat jets in the air. The Russian threat to down any US attack has raised questions over whether their advanced, but as yet untested S-400 air defence system would come into play. The multi-layered anti-aircraft system was deployed to the country after a Russian jet was downed there, and has so far only served as a deterrent. It can fire three types of missiles and is said to be able to engage all aerial targets including aircraft and missiles within a 250-mile (400km) range with remarkable speed and efficiency - essentially providing a blanket of coverage for most of Syria. Russia says the system has remarkable counter-stealth capabilities, warning in 2016 that ""any illusions about 'invisible' jets will inevitably be crushed by disappointing reality"", Steps 1- 4 show how the S-400 system's radar tracks objects, assesses potential threats and launches missiles to destroy the targets  It can guide up to 12 missiles simultaneously, engaging up to six targets at once. Dr Martin S Navias, from the Department of War studies at Kings College London, explains that the S-400 capability complicates usual traditional targeting tactics.  Usually air strikes would aim to neutralise a country's surface-to-air capabilities but Russian anti-aircraft capabilities inside Syria would be an obstacle. Its range stretches well outside Syrian airspace, which could mean targets being engaged before they ever reach Syrian territory.  Some analysts have doubted the claims around the S-400's interception capabilities. Russia also reportedly has several types of aircraft in Syria; Sukhoi-24 bombers, Sukhoi-25 warplanes, multi-role fighters, transport planes, spy planes and helicopter gunships. Many of them are - or have been - stationed at Hmeimim air base, which is Russia's main base for air strikes on rebel groups. The Russian military also reportedly began using Shayrat as a forward operating base for its Mi-24 and Mi-35 attack helicopters. Russia is reported to have used Shayrat as a base for its Mil Mi-24 Hind helicopter gunships From the Mediterranean, the Kremlin has said that it has previously used ""Kalibr cruise missiles from the Rostov-on-Don submarine"" to hit targets in Syria. It has also fired rockets from warships in the Caspian Sea, which it said had struck IS targets in the country. Meanwhile, Russia has withdrawn its battleships from its naval base in the Syrian port city of Tartus, according to recent reports. The BBC's James Lansdale says the UK's Ministry of Defence (MoD) is poised and ready to deploy its resources in Syria. These resources include a number combat aircraft based at RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus, which can be called upon for service at any time. The British military has eight supersonic Tornados stationed at the base. While somewhat aged - they were introduced into service in 1982 - the aircraft have more recently been equipped with precision-guided missiles. RAF Typhoons have also been operating in the region and have carried out numerous strikes in Iraq in recent years. The aircraft use Paveway IV laser-guided bombs and Brimstone missiles to target strikes. The Brimstone air-to-ground missiles are radar-guided, they weigh 49kg, are 1.8m long and thought to cost more than $142,000 (Â£100,000) apiece. What is the Brimstone missile? Take a 360 flight in an RAF Tornado,external This video can not be played The RAF Tornado is flying into retirement next year Britain has a fleet of unmanned aircraft in the Middle East, including about 10 Reaper drones, which have been used in missions over Iraq and Syria. The RAF MQ-9 Reaper drone can fly as high as 50,000ft (15,240m) and has a range of 1,150 miles (1,850km). It carries ""tank-busting"" Hellfire missiles, according to the Royal Navy. The UK's Rivet Joint surveillance aircraft, which can operate in any weather, are available and have already been utilised in US-led operations in Iraq. The MQ-9 is remotely controlled from the ground The MoD says the planes are ""highly inter-operable with the US"", making them ideal for joint operations. Britain, however, does not currently have a submarine in the Mediterranean and getting one into position could take days. The French Navy's nuclear-powered Charles de Gaulle aircraft carrier has previously been deployed for operations against the Islamic State group in the region, but is currently undergoing extensive refitting. The 38,000-tonne ship - France's only such vessel - can carry an arsenal of missiles and bombs and a crew of more than 1,900 personnel. For now, France has deployed sailors and aviators on board the US aircraft carrier USS George H.W. Bush for training and joint operations. France's Charles de Gaulle aircraft carrier had been used for operations in Syria before Separately, France has stationed several Mirage and Rafale fighter jets in Jordan and the United Arab Emirates, which it has used to target so-called Islamic State (IS) in Syria and Iraq. The jets can each carry four 250kg laser-guided bombs. French President Emmanuel Macron has said any strikes on Syria in response to the latest alleged chemical attack would ""not target allies of the [Syrian] regime or attack anyone, but rather attack the regime's chemical capabilities"". Although he did not specify what measures would be taken. Syria's air defence system has been heavily damaged by recent Israeli attacks, but it remains a threat to any aircraft as its missiles are still fast enough to strike them down. An anti-aircraft missile fired at an Israeli F-16 in February caused the jet to crash in northern Israel. The system used to be highly capable, consisting largely of missiles like the S-200, known to Nato by the codename SA-5 ""Gammon"". It has more recently been upgraded to include Russian weapons like the SA-22 and SA-17. Syria has a number of Russian SA-22 surface-to-air missile weapons The S-200 missile is liquid fuelled and designed to fly at speeds of up to Mach 8.  It is guided to its target by radar, before detonating a 217kg (478lb) high-explosive warhead. Syria also deploys a variety of sophisticated Chinese-supplied radar systems. Meanwhile, the Shayrat airbase that was previously attacked by the US, has been occupied by the Syrian military throughout the country's civil war. It has two 3km-long (2 mile) runways, as well as dozens of hangars, buildings and storage facilities. Syrian Air Force Su-22 and MiG-23 warplanes fly from there. However, much of the fleet is old or obsolete and requires significant maintenance to remain militarily capable. Why is there a war in Syria? What are Trump's options in Syria?

What we know about attack,"Medical and rescue organisations say most of the victims were children and women Syrian opposition activists, rescue workers and medics say more than 40 people were killed on 7 April in a suspected chemical attack on Douma, which was the last rebel-held town in the Eastern Ghouta region. The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) says initial tests on samples from two sites detected ""various chlorinated organic chemicals"", along with explosive residues. However, no nerve agents were detected. The Syrian government denies ever using chemical weapons, and its ally Russia says it has evidence that the incident was staged with the help of the UK. In February, forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad launched an assault on the Eastern Ghouta that reportedly left more than 1,700 civilians dead. In March, troops split the region into three pockets - the largest of which was around Douma, home to between 80,000 and 150,000 people. Facing defeat, rebel groups in the other two pockets agreed to be evacuated to northern Syria. But the group controlling Douma, Jaysh al-Islam, continued to hold out. On 6 April, after negotiations with the government stalled, air strikes resumed. The bombardment continued for a second day, with dozens of people reportedly killed or injured by conventional munitions before the suspected chemical attack. Activists from the Violations Documentation Center (VDC), which records alleged violations of international law in Syria, reportedtwo separate incidents of bombs believed to contain toxic substances being dropped by the Syrian Air Force,external. The first occurred at approximately 16:00 (13:00 GMT) and saw the Saada bakery on Omar Ibn Al-Khattab street in north-western Douma targeted, the VDC said. Activists say Douma came under intense aerial bombardment on Saturday It cited a member of the Syria Civil Defence, whose rescue workers are widely known as the White Helmets, as saying he smelt chlorine in the air after the strike, but that he could not determine its source. The VDC said the second incident took place not far to the east, near Martyrs' Square, at approximately 19:30. At 19:45, more than 500 patients - most of them women and children - were brought to medical facilities with symptoms indicative of exposure to a chemical agent,external, according to the Syria Civil Defence and the Syrian American Medical Society (SAMS), which supports hospitals in rebel-held areas. This video can not be played Unverified video shows children being treated after the alleged gas attack The patients showed signs of ""respiratory distress, central cyanosis [blue skin or lips], excessive oral foaming, corneal burns, and the emission of chlorine-like odour"", a joint statement issued on Sunday said. One woman who died had convulsions and pinpoint pupils. Rescue workers searching homes in the affected area also found the bodies of people with oral foaming, cyanosis, and corneal burns, the statement added. The Union of Medical Care and Relief Organizations (UOSSM), which supports hospitals in rebel-held Syria, also saidit received reports of two incidents,external. Patients were hosed down with water to remove any chemicals on their skin People were treated for breathing difficulties and irritation of the eyes following the first, the UOSSM said. After the second, patients were brought to hospital smelling strongly of a chlorine-like substance and presenting symptoms that included cyanosis, foaming of the mouth, and cornea irritation, it added. A medical student working at a hospital told the BBC he had treated a man who died,external. ""His pupils were dilated and he had foam in his mouth. His heart was very slow. Then he coughed blood into his mouth as well,"" he said. Two videos circulated by the opposition activist group Douma Revolution showed what it said werethe bodies of children, women and men found in one block of flats,external, which is believed to be located south-west of Martyrs' Square. Some had foam coming out of their mouths and noses. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Activists also posted avideo which they said showed a yellow industrial gas cylinder on the balcony of the same block of flats,external. One end of the cylinder was lying in a crater-like opening in the reinforced concrete floor. A second gas cylinder was filmed on the bed of a top-floor flat,externalto the south-west, below a crater-like opening in the concrete roof. The World Health Organization said on 11 April that it had received reports from its local ""health cluster partners"" of43 deaths related to symptoms consistent with exposure to highly toxic chemicals"",external. The Syria Civil Defence and SAMS said rescue workers found 42 people dead in their homes. One person was declared dead on arrival at a hospital, and another six died while receiving treatment, they added. An earlier, now deleted tweet by the Syria Civil Defence put the number dead at more than 150. The UOSSM initially reported that 70 people were confirmed dead. On 9 April,it revised down the figure to at least 42,external. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group, said air strikes on 6 and 7 April killed almost 100 people. It said they included 21 who died as a result of suffocation, but that it was unable to identify the cause. The British investigative journalism website, Bellingcat, said it had counted at least 34 bodies,externalin the two videos circulated by Douma Revolution. Bellingcat also assessed that the block of flats near Martyrs' Square where the bodies were filmed wasvisited by Russian military personnel on 9 April,external. The Syria Civil Defence and SAMS said the day after the incident that they believed those who died suffocated as a result of exposure to toxic chemicals, most likely an organophosphate - a compound grouping associated with pesticides and nerve agents, such as Sarin. The UOSSM also concluded that the symptoms of the casualties were consistent with exposure to a nerve agent, possibly one mixed with chlorine. On 13 April, the US said itassessed ""with confidence that the Syrian regime used chemical weapons"",external. The conclusion was ""based on descriptions of the attack in multiple media sources, the reported symptoms experienced by victims, videos and images showing two assessed barrel bombs from the attack, and reliable information indicating co-ordination between Syrian military officials before the attack"". It added: ""A significant body of information points to the regime using chlorine in its bombardment of Douma, while some additional information points to the regime also using the nerve agent Sarin."" A fact-finding team from the OPCW has travelled to Damascus to investigate the allegations The OPCW, which oversees the Chemical Weapons Convention, dispatched experts from its Fact-Finding Mission (FFM) to Damascus five days after the attack. But they were unable to visit any of the sites of interest until 21 April because of an attack on a UN security team conducting a reconnaissance mission. The FFM team interviewed witnesses and collected environmental samples and data from three locations:the hospital where victims were allegedly treated for chemical exposure,external;the block of flats with the cylinder on the balcony,external(referred to as ""Location 2"");the flat with the cylinder on the bed,external(""Location 4""). The team also gathered or received samples and interviewed witnesses, including alleged casualties, in a neighbouring country. On 6 July, a preliminary report issued by the OPCW said ""no organophosphorus nerve agents or their degradation products were detected,external, either in the environmental samples or in plasma samples from the alleged casualties"".  However, it added, ""various chlorinated organic chemicals were found in samples from Locations 2 and 4, along with residues of explosive"". The OPCW said the FFM team was now working to establish the significance of the results. It is also assessing the association of the two gas cylinders with the incident, the relative damage to the cylinders and the roofs, and how the cylinders arrived at their respective locations. The chlorinated compounds included those used to treat drinking water, as a disinfectant, a wood preservative, or a flame retardant. However, the same compounds were detected at other sites in Syria where the OPCW has concluded that chlorine was likely used as a weapon, includingSaraqeb,externalandLatamina,external. President Assad has accused the US, UK and France of ""staging"" the incident in Douma,externalwith the help of the Syria Civil Defence, which receives funding from Western governments. ""It was a lie. After we liberated that area our information confirmed the attack did not take place,"" he told the Daily Mail on 9 June. ""The British government should prove with evidence that the attack happened, and then they should prove who is responsible. This did not happen."" Syrian government ground forces advanced towards Douma on Saturday Russian permanent representative to the UN Vassily Nebenzia told the Security Council on 9 April thatRussian military specialists had visited Douma and taken soil samples that showed no presence of nerve agents or substances containing chlorine,external. He also said no-one with symptoms of exposure to sarin or chlorine had been admitted to Douma's hospital, nor any bodies found. Four days later, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Russia had ""irrefutable evidence that this was yet another attack, staged with the participation of special services of one state that is striving to be at the forefront of the Russophobic campaign"". This video can not be played Russia's foreign minister says the only evidence of a chemical attack came from the media A British diplomat called the allegation ""bizarre"" and a ""blatant lie"". On 26 April, Russian and Syrian diplomats presented to a briefing at the OPCW's headquarters in The Hague more than a dozen people from Douma who said they had not seen any evidence of chemical weapons being used there. They included Hasan Diab,an 11-year-old boy who was seen being doused in water,externalin a video widely circulated online after the alleged attack. ""We heard cries on the street that we should go to the hospital. We got scared. We went to the hospital through the tunnel,""he told reporters,external. ""They started pouring water on me at the hospital. I don't know why."" Hasan Diab, 11, appeared at a briefing organised by Russian and Syrian diplomats in The Hague Western nations dismissed the event as ""nothing more than a crude propaganda exercise"",externaland an ""obscene masquerade"". The US said it had no information to suggest Jaysh al-Islam had ever used chemical weapons,external, and that it was unlikely that the opposition could have fabricated the number of reports that came from Douma on 7 April and ""deceived multiple media outlets while evading our detection"". United Nations Secretary General AntÃ³nio Guterres said he was outraged by the reports from Douma,externaland warned that ""any confirmed use of chemical weapons, by any party to the conflict and under any circumstances, is abhorrent and a clear violation of international law"". Hours before the OPCW Fact-Finding Mission team arrived in Damascus on 14 April, the US, UK and France carried out missile strikes on three sites they said were ""specifically associated with the Syrian regime's chemical weapons programme"". This video can not be played How the Western attacks on Syria's suspected chemical weapons sites unfolded The US military said warships and jets launched 105 missiles,externalthat hit a branch of the Scientific Studies and Research Centre (SSRC) in the capital's Barzeh district, the Him Shinshar chemical weapons storage facility west of the city of Homs, and a nearby chemical weapons bunker. US President Donald Trump said he wanted ""to establish a strong deterrent against the production, spread, and use of chemical weapons"",external. The Syrian foreign ministry denounced ""the barbaric aggression"". In August 2013, rockets containing Sarin were fired at several opposition-held suburbs in the Eastern and Western Ghouta, killing hundreds of people.UN experts confirmed that Sarin was used in the attack,external, but they were not asked to ascribe any blame. Western powers said only Syrian government forces could have carried out the attack. President Assad denied the allegation, but he did agree to sign the Chemical Weapons Convention and destroy Syria's declared chemical arsenal. Experts from a joint UN-OPCW mission also said they were confident that government forces used Sarin in an attack in April 2017 on the rebel-held Khan Sheikhoun,external, which reportedly killed more than 80 people. President Assad dismissed the attack as a fabrication, but the US carried a cruise missile strike on a Syrian airbase in retaliation. The UN-OPCW mission also found that government forces used chlorine as a weapon on at least three occasions during the civil war.

Homeless family lived in hotel for years,"This video can not be played Father Luke Burns describes his family's three years living in hotels A homeless family shared a hotel room for more than three years after a council made mistakes with their housing application, an ombudsman said. Luke and Olga Burns rented the rooms without cooking facilities while Bristol City Council repeatedly refused them a place on the housing register. The council has apologised after an investigation criticised its housing and children's services' departments. The ombudsman said the authority should pay the family Â£9,000 in compensation. Mr and Mrs Burns say they rented rooms in 12 different Premier Inns using their housing benefit and money from relatives after they were evicted from their privately-rented flat because of flood damage. An investigation by the Local Government and Social Care Ombudsman said the couple, who then had two children, first asked the city council for help in April 2014. After the birth of their third child, it said the authority still refused to assess their needs. The council deemed the Burns family ""intentionally homeless"" after they refused temporary accommodation The ombudsman also criticised the council for trying to charge the family for storing their belongings. It said the family had found private lets but lost the properties because the council took too long to consider their requests help to pay the deposit. In a joint statement, homes and communities councillor Paul Smith and families councillor Helen Goodwin apologised and said: ""While we recognise that the situation was unacceptable for a family with young children, we do believe that we tried to do our best for the family on a number of occasions."" Speaking to the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme, Mr Smith said: ""The family came from outside Bristol into a hotel and then contacted us. ""At one stage they were deemed to be intentionally homeless because they refused offers of temporary accommodation but we did not act properly, particularly in relation to the children and their needs, and there are real issues there which we have addressed."" The ombudsman said the council had agreed to wipe off the contribution the father agreed to make for storage costs and said the council should pay Â£9,000 for the delay and distress caused.

'Last lion tamer' refused circus licence,"Thomas Chipperfield has said that he is preparing to mount a second appeal against the decision The UK's last lion tamer has been refused a licence to use three big cats in a travelling circus. Thomas Chipperfield's appeal against the decision, made by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs in July, was also dismissed in court. A Defra spokesman said it remained ""absolute"" in its commitment to ban wild animals in circuses. Mr Chipperfield, of Winchester, Hampshire, said no welfare concerns were raised and he plans a new appeal. He has been keeping his animals - two lions and a tiger - in Cannock, Staffordshire. Midlands Live: Hybrid car bursts into flames on drive; Man stabbed in hospital car park A BBC freedom of information request confirmed he initially submitted an application to the government department for his Big Cats Live circus, at Winter Quarters in Staffordshire, in April last year. Mr Chipperfield appealed against Defra's July decision but it was upheld by North Staffordshire Magistrates Court in January. Defra said it was refused because it was not satisfied licensing conditions would be met based on Mr Chipperfield's previous conduct as an operator of a travelling circus and other relevant circumstances. Veterinary checks are made on the animals kept by Thomas Chipperfield The court said it rejected the appeal because although he was very experienced with big cats, along with concerns over licensing conditions not being met it felt he would also be unable to maintain suitable care plans for the animals and to provide written itineraries. Mr Chipperfield told BBC News pursuing a second appeal limited what he could say but he had ""consistently acted in good faith with my team on the advice given by the circus licensing panel and their inspectors. This advice was often conflicting."" The government has said it will not seek to renew regulations allowing animals in travelling circuses once they expire in 2020. A Defra spokesperson said: ""[This is because] we remain absolute in our commitment to banning wild animals in circuses and intend to introduce the ban prior to the regulations expiring in January 2020. ""Until we are able to achieve this, we will impose the strictest possible standards to ensure the welfare needs of these animals are met."" Jan Creamer from Animal Defenders International said it was ""a victory for common sense"", adding that ""travelling shows cannot meet animals' needs"".

Woman jailed for slamming dog on patio,"In video footage shown in court, Joanne Hosking can be seen slamming Edie into the patio A woman who beat her dog and slammed it onto a patio has been jailed for 18 weeks. Joanne Hosking, 41, admitted causing unnecessary suffering to Edie, a terrier-type dog, in July 2017. Hosking and husband Christopher, 45, of St Ives, Cornwall, also admitted failing to provide veterinary care at Bodmin Magistrates' Court. The RSPCA said the ""innocent dog"" was picked up to shoulder height and slammed down twice. There's more on this story on BBC Devon and Cornwall Local Live The Hoskings have been banned from keeping animals for life and ordered to pay Â£1,450. Christopher Hoskings was also electronically tagged and put under a curfew. Christopher and Joanne Hosking admitted failing to provide veterinary care The court was shown footage of Edie being beaten and limping and moaning around the garden. Veterinary evidence showed the dog had a dislocated hip for seven days and would have been in considerable pain. It also needed an operation to remove part of the joint. RSPCA inspector Paul Kempson, said: ""I've been doing this job for 22 years and I honestly thought I'd seen everything that I could possibly see. ""The number of times that I've had to sit through that video and watch it, when I see that little 12-month-old innocent dog being picked up to shoulder height and slammed down onto concrete paving slabs twice and hearing the thud as she makes contact - it actually turns my stomach every time I see it."" The court was told Edie had been re-homed with a veterinary nurse and had now recovered.

Inspectors back UK in spy poisoning row,"In the days after the poisoning, specialist officers wore protective suits at the scene in Salisbury The international chemical weapons watchdog has confirmed the UK's analysis of the type of nerve agent used in the Russian ex-spy poisoning. The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons did not name the nerve agent as Novichok, butsaid it agreed with the UK's findings on its identity.,external Russia, which denies it was behind the attack in Salisbury, called the allegations an ""anti-Russian campaign"". Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said: ""There can be no doubt what was used."" He added: ""There remains no alternative explanation about who was responsible - only Russia has the means, motive and record."" But Maria Zakharova, from the Russian Foreign Ministry, said the allegations in relation to the poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal were a ""clear anti-Russian campaign, the like of which we have not seen in the world for a long time in terms of its scale and lack of principles"". She accused the British authorities of ignoring the ""norms of international law, the principles and laws of diplomacy, the elementary rules of human ethics"". And she claimed no one except for British authorities had seen the Skripals for more than a month. She drew comparisons with the case of Alexander Litvinenko, theex-KGB agent who died in 2006 in London, adding that at least a photograph of Litvinenko had appeared after his poisoning. What happened to Sergei and Yulia Skripal? Yulia Skripal: No-one speaks for me Who is Sergei Skripal? A team from the OPCW visited the UK on 19 March, 15 days after the Skripals were found slumped on a park bench in Salisbury and taken to hospital, along with a police officer who was among the first on the scene. Ms Skripal wasdischarged from hospitalon Monday but the 33-year-old has said her father is ""still seriously ill"". Sergei Skripal remains in hospital but his daughter Yulia has been discharged The OPCW said it received information about the medical conditions of the Skripals and Det Sgt Nick Bailey, it collected their blood samples, and it gathered samples from the site in Salisbury. Mr Johnson said the UK had invited the OPCW to test the samples ""to ensure strict adherence to international chemical weapons protocols"". UK inspectors from the defence research facility at Porton Down in Wiltshire first identified the nerve agent as belonging to the Novichok group. The name Novichok means ""newcomer"" in Russian, and applies to a group of nerve agents developed by the Soviet Union in the 1970s and 1980s. Novichok's existence was revealed by chemist Dr Vil Mirzayanov in the 1990s, via Russian media. He says the nerve agents were designed to escape detection by international inspectors. Novichok agents are liquids, although others are thought to exist in solid form and could be dispersed as an ultra-fine powder. Some of the agents are also said to be ""binary weapons"", meaning the nerve agent is typically stored as two less toxic chemical ingredients that are easier to handle. When these are mixed, they react to produce the active toxic agent which can cause convulsions, shortness of breath, profuse sweating and nausea. The OPCW does identify the toxic chemical by its complex formula but only in the classified report that has not been made public. In its summary, which has been published online, the report notes the toxic chemical was of ""high purity"". The BBC's diplomatic correspondent James Landale said: ""This is understood to strengthen the argument that this substance came from Russia because it is more likely to have been created by a state actor with the capability to make the nerve agent."" The report does not name the source of the nerve agent, a subject which is beyond the remit of the inspectors. The UK has called for a UN Security Council meeting on the OPCW report, likely to be held next week. Russian spy: What happened to the Skripals?

The 10 worst A&Es for waits revealed,"A&E waiting times have reached their highest levels in England - as a BBC analysis indentifies the services with the worst individual waits. Hospitals are meant to see 95% of patients in four hours. But the difficult winter means the NHS has recorded its worst-ever annual performance - at 88.4% - since records began in 2004, NHS England data showed. The single worst service was Princess Alexandra Hospital in Essex, which only saw 70.9% in four hours during 2017-18. This was followed by East Kent Hospitals on 74.3%. The worst performance has been seen at the major units, once NHS trusts exclude the minor injury units and walk-in centres they run. Yearly figures are not in for the rest of the UK yet, although during winter the overall performance was worse in Northern Ireland and Wales. Scotland's A&Es have been at a similar level to England's. Ian Dalton, head of NHS Improvement, which regulates the health service, said hospitals were facing a ""mammoth"" task coping with rising numbers of patients, particularly the sickest that need to be admitted on to wards. But he conceded: ""Nobody working in the NHS will be happy with the effect this has had on how quickly we have seen and treated patients.""

NHS at 70: Share your stories and memories But Dr Nick Scriven, president of the Society for Acute Medicine, said it showed the NHS was facing an ""eternal winter"" and warned it would now be difficult to catch up on the planned operations that were cancelled during the past few months. ""The fear is patients will feel the effects of this year's winter for weeks and months to come so there is a desperate need for much earlier winter planning if we are to avoid a repeat of this nightmare."" Phillippa Hentsch, of NHS Providers, which represents hospital bosses, said the figures ""underlined the urgency of the problems facing the NHS"". She said there were simply not enough ""beds and staff"". A Department of Health and Social Care spokesman praised the ""dedication of staff"", especially over the winter which saw bad weather and high levels of flu. He pointed out the prime minister had committed to coming up with a long-term funding plan - widely assumed to be a 10-year settlement - later this year which would help the health service prepare better for pressures in coming years.

BBC defends Rivers of Blood broadcast,"The BBC has defended a decision to air Enoch Powell's 1968 ""Rivers of Blood"" speech on Radio 4. The Archive on 4 programme, presented by BBC media editor Amol Rajan, will on Saturday broadcast the right-wing MP's anti-immigration speech - voiced by an actor - in full, for the first time. The decision to do so was criticised as an ""incitement to racial hatred"". The BBC said there would be ""rigorous journalistic analysis"" and the show was not endorsing controversial views. Delivered to local Conservative Party members in Birmingham, days before the second reading of the 1968 Race Relations Bill, then MP Powell referenced observations made by his Wolverhampton constituents including ""in 15 or 20 years' time the black man will have the whip hand over the white man"". He ended with a quote from Virgil's Aeneid, when civil war in Italy is predicted with ""the River Tiber foaming with much blood"". The anti-immigration speech ended his career in Edward Heath's shadow cabinet. The Race Relations Act made it illegal to refuse housing, employment or public services to people because of their ethnic background. Allow Twitter content?

Intimidation plea in burglar death row,"Iain Gordon pulled down floral tributes from a fence opposite the home of Richard Osborn-Brooks People laying flowers in tribute to a suspected burglar who was fatally stabbed should not feel intimidated, a senior Met Police officer says. Sir Craig Mackey, Met deputy commissioner, has also urged those placing tributes to Henry Vincent to be ""respectful"" to local people. The tributes have been repeatedly attacked and removed from a fence opposite the home where he was stabbed. Residents have described them as being ""in poor taste"". The row has put a strain on police resources, according to Sir Craig. Flowers left for burglar 'an insult' Hither Green burglary suspect hunted by Met Police What are your rights in tackling burglars? The 37-year-old, along withBill Jeeves is suspected of burgling Richard Osborn-Brooks' home on South Park Crescent- which remains cordoned off by police - on 4 April. Since Mr Vincent's death the floral tributes had been appearing on the fence opposite Mr Osborn-Brooks' home. In the middle of Monday night the flowers and balloons were taken down and placed on the pavement by an unknown man. This video can not be played A man was seen stamping on flowers and balloons left in tribute to Henry Vincent By Tuesday lunchtime the family of Mr Vincent - understood to be part of the travelling community - put them back up on the fence, however 30 minutes later a second man tore them down, put them in a pile and stamped on them. The tributes were reattached for a third time at 17:00 BST, but at 21:30 BST another man turned up and took away half of the bouquets. On Wednesday morning half of the fence was still covered with tributes, but these were stripped down at midday by another man and have been completely removed. The row has put a strain on the Met's resources, Deputy Commissioner Sir Craig Mackey says Speaking on LBC the deputy commissioner said the Met was working with Lewisham Council to work out how to manage the tributes. ""We want those laying flowers to respect the local people and the impact on them,"" he said. ""Those opposed to the flowers should act responsibly, respectfully and reasonably. ""As theborough commander said yesterdaywe don't want anyone - the local people or those visiting the scene - to feel intimidated."" Henry Vincent's family said the fence was ""the best place"" for a tribute His comments come after Lewisham's borough commander, Ch Supt Simon Dobinson, urged members of the public ""to respect the wishes of those who choose to place flowers and other tributes in the area."" Stephen Langley-Hart, 72, a former resident of South Park Crescent, said: ""They have the right to grieve even given the circumstances, but it could be done in a better way. It is really not terribly nice to have this thing opposite the house. It is a provocation. ""The police really have much better things to do than guard a flower display. They should be doing other things but I hope it is not going to escalate. I really hope they're not going to come back.""

Amazon criticised over child sex dolls,"This child sex doll was removed by Amazon but was back on the website days later England's Children's Commissioner says Amazon should ensure ""disgusting"" child sex dolls are not restored for sale on its website, after a BBC investigation found them for sale on its platform. About a dozen child sex dolls were found for sale on Amazon Marketplace. After the BBC contacted Amazon about one doll it was removed, but three days later it was back on the website. Amazon said it had now removed all the specific products which the BBC drew to its attention. In a statement Amazon said: ""All Marketplace sellers must follow our selling guidelines and those who don't will be subject to action including potential removal of their account. The products in question are no longer available."" Anne Longfield, Children's Commissioner for England, said the dolls were a 'clear danger' Responding to the BBC investigation, Anne Longfield, England Children's Commissioner, said: ""These dolls are disgusting and are clearly meant to look like children. ""Not only do I, as Children's Commissioner, but the wider public also, have a right to expect a huge company like Amazon, to not only remove these products from their platform, but to explain why they are on there in the first place and ensure they can't just be reloaded having been taken down. ""Such dolls are clearly built for one purpose and that purpose is a clear danger to the safety of real children,"" she added. The UK Border Force has seized 179 child-like sex dolls since March 2016 as part of Operation Shiraz, a special operation set up in conjunction with the National Crime Agency. In July 2017, a judge ruled child sex dolls were obscene items and therefore covered by the 1979 Customs and Excise Management Act. However, it is not a criminal offence to manufacture or possess a child sex doll: individuals can only be charged for importing them. The 'new phenomenon' of child sex dolls Child sex doll an obscene item, judge rules Ex-school governor who imported child sex doll is jailed Amazon Marketplace is an area of the retailing website where third party businesses can sell products. Amazon does not sell the products itself but instead receives money from the sellers. Dolls found on the website were typically three or four feet tall with waist sizes around 16 inches (41cm). In the accompanying pictures they were placed in sexual poses with descriptions such as ""Mannequin Sexy"" and ""100% mimics girl's body"". Several dolls were described as coming with ""sexy lingerie"". A couple from Durham were horrified to find that a child sex doll came up in the results for their online search for sex toys. ""We felt disgusted and we straight away reported it to Amazon,"" they told the BBC. Twenty four hours later the couple had received no response from the retailer. The NSPCC has warned use of the dolls can lead people to harm children. Designed to be as lifelike as possible, they are made of a silicone type material and weigh as much as a child. The dolls are made in such a way as to enable sex acts to be performed on them. The head of policy at the children's charity NSPCC, Almudena Lara, highlighted the danger child sex dolls can pose to children. She told the BBC: ""We already know that there is a risk that people using these dolls could become desensitised and their behaviour could become normalised to them, so that they go on to harm children, as is often the case with those who view indecent images of children online. ""There is absolutely no evidence that using the dolls stops potential abusers from abusing children. ""Until gaps in the law are addressed to make it illegal to make, sell or distribute them, retailers like Amazon should refuse to sell these vile dolls,"" she said.

Student suicide rates overtake non-students,"The suicide rate among UK students is higher than among the general population of their age group, claim researchers. The study, to be presented next month at the International Suicide Prevention Conference in New Zealand, has analysed figures for student suicides between 2007 and 2016. But the Office for National Statistics cautions that ""year-to-year differences could reflect change in the population of students across time as opposed to change in the risk of suicide"". There has been much concern about mental health worries on university campuses - but it has often been argued that suicide rates for students have been lower than the general population. University reveals suicide attempt call-outs Universities struggle with rising mental health problems Advice and contact information from the Samaritans,external But the Hong Kong-based researchers say there no longer seems to be this ""protective effect against suicide"". Male students have consistently had higher suicide rates, but the research says there has been a particular increase among female students. Dr Raymond Kwok, of the Centre for Suicide Research and Prevention, at Hong Kong University, said, ""between 2012 and 2016, there is a significant trend in rising suicides for UK female students, with the exception of those in Scotland"". Researchers say that between 2007 and 2016, student suicide rates increased by 56% - from 6.6 to 10.3 per 100,000 of the population. The 2016 figures showed 146 student suicides, the highest in records going back to 2001. Between 2001 and 2007, there had been a pattern of falling numbers, but since then numbers have tended to rise. These figures also do not specify the type of ""student"", whether at university or some other form of study. But the Office for National Statistics said that this data ""cannot be used to ascertain the risk of suicide among students"". The ONS says it is currently working on developing ""a robust method for understanding the risk of suicide among certain kinds of students"". ""Concerns about students' mental health have been increasing since the economic recession, but until now there has been no comprehensive analysis of UK student suicide data,"" said Edward Pinkney, who has tracked student suicide data and co-authored the analysis. ""This is the first time we can conclusively say that as far as suicide is concerned, there is a real problem in higher education,"" he said. There have been warnings about anxiety and mental health worries among university students. A report published in autumn showed the numbers ofstudents disclosing mental health problems had increased fivefold in a decade. The analysis - from the Institute of Public Policy Research - showed higher rates of problems among female students. Sir Anthony Seldon, vice-chancellor of the University of Buckingham and a campaigner on student well-being, said: ""Student suicide rates and emotional distress levels could be reduced at university if we acted differently. ""More support in transitions, better tutoring and early warning, more peer to peer support, an enhanced sense of belonging, would all enhance wellbeing and reduce risk. ""We are obsessed by reactive policy once students hit the bottom of the waterfall; we need to be putting preventative policies in place to prevent them ever tipping over the edge,"" said Sir Anthony.

Bolt adds touch of glamour at the Commonwealth Games,"He might not be running but he remains in the limelight - organisers were delighted by Usain Bolt's appearance at the Commonwealth Games 2018 Commonwealth Games Venue: Gold Coast, Australia Dates: 4-15 April Coverage: Watch live on BBC TV and Red Button with extra streams on Connected TVs, BBC Sport website and app; listen on Radio 5 live; follow text updates online.Times and channels The sub-10 second bursts of brilliance are gone but, track exploits apart, Usain Bolt is still living fast. The Jamaican spent the early hours of Thursday morning amid a haze of dry ice, camera phones and free cognac, DJ-ing at a Gold Coast nightclub that skimps only on uniforms for its female waiting staff. Ten hours later though, hiding behind shades from an unsympathetic sun, his endurance was being tested. At a beachfront news conference, many of the cameras had long lenses, those wanting a moment of his time were paid-up media, and the man himself was playing it unusually safe. Who does he expect the void he has left behind in athletics? ""It is a wide open field it is about someone stepping up,"" he answered. What about the possibility of his ninth Olympic gold being returned to him via relay team-mate Nesta Carter's appeal? ""I have moved past that now, just waiting for the verdict"". On the absence of a string of big stars from the Commonwealth Games? ""They were always very important to me, but everyone makes their own decisions for their own reasons."" There were moments where his warmth and wit shone through. Told that the world was still ""obsessed"" with him despite him hanging up his spikes, Bolt silently gripped a fist in celebration. One journalist asked if he was right to think that Bolt could yet return for Tokyo 2020. ""You are very wrong,"" Bolt shot back immediately. Bolt - see here with Hollywood actor Chris Hemsworth - remains very much a star attraction at a Games where he is not even competing But Bolt's appearance at the Games was more about the mere physical fact of him being here. The trademark Cheshire cat grin broke across his face as he posed for photos, there was a flurry of camera shutters, and everyone left happy. Eight months after his retirement,the circus, in thrall to Bolt's class clown-turned-ringmaster magnetism, is still drawn in. Those organising and paying behind the scenes hope that, via the media scrum that surrounds Bolt, some of his carefree charisma radiates out to the causes he is promoting. His groaning sponsorship portfolio includes an Australian telecoms company. He is an ambassador-at-large for Jamaica, promoting his home nation to the world.  Gold Coast 2018 were in talks with his advisors nearly a year ago to make sure that he attended in his new non-competitive capacity. It is unclear quite what the cost of bringing Bolt to the Games came to and how it was shared. Commonwealth Games chief executive David Grevemberg said only that it was ""nothing exorbitant"". Especially considering what Bolt provides. On Monday night at the Carrara Stadium, Cathy Freeman, the centre of Australia's seminal sporting moment when she won 400m gold at the Sydney Olympics, was interviewed on the track. On Tuesday it was the turn of Anna Meares - a local girl, born in Queensland, who left cycling as a multiple world and Olympic champion. Many things might have changed now that Bolt has retired - but the huge smile is still refreshingly present Their reception from the crowd was warm, polite and respectful. For Bolt - whose only Commonwealth Games appearance was as a relay anchor on a rainy evening in Glasgow four years ago - it was something a little closer to mania when he presented the final set of medals at the same venue on Thursday night. IAAF president Seb Coe, speaking earlier this week, was not the first to compare Bolt's human connection to the legendary Muhammad Ali. Ali used his lofty platform differently though. Bolt never strayed into the polemic and political - the difficult, tangled human matter that made Ali a personality that resounded far beyond his days in the ring. Maybe that will come. Bolt is still 31, a young man finding his new niche. For now though, without a chorus line of staggering sporting acts in the background, the Bolt sideshow, at least on this scale, may be on a limited run.

Soldier 'sabotaged wife's parachute',"Sgt Emilie Cilliers was having two affairs and also using prostitutes, the court heard An Army sergeant who was having two affairs tampered with his wife's parachute to try and kill her, a court has heard. Emile Cilliers, 38, of the Royal Army Physical Training Corps, faces two charges of attempted murder. A retrial at Winchester Crown Court heard Mr Cilliers held his wife Victoria ""in contempt"" and ""wanted to get rid of her permanently"". Mr Cilliers denies all the charges against him. Victoria Cilliers was seriously injured when her main and reserve parachutes failed during a jump at the Army Parachute Association at Netheravon, Wiltshire, on Easter Sunday, 5 April 2015. The court heard the victim was a ""highly experienced parachutist and parachute instructor"". Victoria Cilliers almost died in the 2015 parachute jump Prosecutor, Michael Bowes QC, said: ""When she jumped out of the plane at 4,000ft, both her main parachute and her reserve parachute failed, causing her to spiral to the ground. ""Those attending the scene expected to find her dead. ""Although she was badly injured, almost miraculously she survived that fall."" He said that soon after she landed on the ground, people at the scene realised vital pieces of kit were missing. The prosecution told jurors the defendant was having an affair with a woman called Stefanie Goller. Mr Bowes told the court Mr Cilliers was also having a ""sexual relationship"" with his ex-wife Carly Cilliers and had ""contact with a number of prostitutes"". The court heard he lived ""parallel lives"" with his wife, ex-wife and mistress. In a series of WhatsApp messages between him and Ms Goller read to the court, the accused expressed his love for her. He also sent messages to Ms Goller while his pregnant wife was going into labour. Mr Cilliers lied that he was not the baby's father and his wife had an affair, the jury heard. He also claimed he had already left his wife. Mr Bowes said: ""It shows the depth he will sink and manipulate when it suits him."" The 38-year-old Army sergeant was Â£22,000 in debt and believed he was set to receive a Â£120,000 insurance payout in the event of his wife's accidental death, Mr Bowes said. Mr Cilliers also denies a charge of damaging a gas fitting recklessly endangering life. This allegation refers to a gas valve being damaged at the couple's family home in Amesbury, Wiltshire, a few days prior to the near-fatal parachute jump. The trial continues.

Fury to make comeback on 9 June,"This video can not be played Tyson Fury: I'm ready to take back what's mine Former heavyweight champion Tyson Fury will return to boxing on 9 June against an unnamed opponent in Manchester - his first fight since 2015. Fury, 29, has not fought since claiming the IBF, WBA and WBO world titles from Wladimir Klitschko in November 2015. Fury was suspended in 2016 amid ""anti-doping and medical issues"" and accepted a backdated two-year ban in December. ""I can't wait to get in there and prove I am the best even after all this time out,"" Fury said. ""I'm coming into the prime of my life now. I'm stronger, faster, more confident. Looking at the competition out there, it should be relatively easy."" Fury is back - bonus 5 live Boxing with Costello & Bunce podcast Joshua and Fury share more than a rivalry Fury first fought as a professional in December 2008 and has won all 25 of his pro bouts. During his absence, fellow Briton Anthony Joshua has taken the IBF, IBO, WBA and WBO world heavyweight titles, while unbeaten American Deontay Wilder holds the WBC belt. Fury had his licence reinstated this year and has now signed with promoter Frank Warren. Fury said Wilder is ""top of the pile"" in the heavyweight division but added: ""They're all very vulnerable and very beatable too."" Of Joshua's success he said: ""I've got to congratulate the fella, he's done very well. I hope he makes 10 times more money than he's already got."" Promoter Warren said Fury was ""already fit"" but was ""going to be busy"" getting himself ""fighting fit"". ""He needs to get some rounds under his belt,"" Warren added. ""The agenda will be Tyson's agenda."" Afterbeating Joseph Parkerto win the WBO title on 31 March, Joshua said: ""I want Wilder. Or Fury. Get him [Wilder] in the ring and I'll knock him spark out."" The WBA has sinceorderedJoshua to begin negotiations with Russia's mandatory challenger Alexander Povetkin, but the Londoner says he would prefer to fight Wilder next.

Thunderstorm destroys Taj Mahal minarets,"One of the destroyed minarets was located at the royal gate to the Taj Mahal A storm has damaged two minarets located at different entry gates of the iconic Taj Mahal in the northern Indian city of Agra. Officials told the BBC that winds blowing at 130kmh (80mph) caused the 12ft (4m) pillars to collapse. The four longer minarets that surround the main structure remain intact. The 17th Century mausoleum attracts about 12,000 visitors a day and is one of the world's most popular tourist attractions. One of the destroyed minarets was located at the royal gate where tourists often get their first glimpse of the monument. The other was located at the southern gate. Authorities said that work had begun to restore the damaged structures. One of the minarets damaged in the storm No one was injured by the falling pillars India's official recorded history says that Mughal ruler Shah Jahan built the Taj Mahal in memory of his queen, Mumtaj Mahal. The monument's complex structure of white marble domes and minarets inlaid with semi-precious stones and carvings is considered the finest example of Mughal art in India But it has suffered damage due to pollution and construction activity in recent years. The Archaeological Survey of India, the custodian of the country's monuments, said in January thatthe Taj Mahal was at risk of losing its sheen and structure due to increased pollution levels in Agra.

Late risers 'likelier to have early death',"People who go to bed late and struggle to wake in the morning are more likely to die prematurely than early risers, according to new research. Night owls are 10% more likely to have early deaths than morning larks, a study of some 433,000 people found. The research also found late risers were more likely to have a range of mental and physical illnesses. The paper's authors said more should be done to help night owls function in a ""morning lark world"". Scientists asked study participants, who were aged 38 to 73, whether they considered themselves to be a ""definite morning type"", a ""moderate morning type"", a ""moderate evening type"", or a ""definite evening type"". The study,published in the journal Chronobiology International,external, then looked at deaths among these people for up to six and half years later. After adjusting for factors like age, sex, ethnicity, smoking, body mass index and socioeconomic status, researchers found the chance of an early death was lowest in the definite morning types, with the risk going up among each body clock type as they got later. Comparing the definite evening types with definite morning types, night owls were also 90% more likely to have psychological disorders and 30% more likely to have diabetes, as well as being more prone to gastrointestinal and neurological disorders. While the paper's authors did not look at how the health issues were being caused, they said it was likely that people with late body clocks were being harmed by having to adjust their habits to a ""morning lark world"". Night owls should try to limit or eliminate screen time at night, experts say Kristen Knutson, associate professor of neurology at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, said: ""It could be psychological stress, eating at the wrong time for your body, not exercising enough, not sleeping enough, being awake at night by yourself, maybe drug or alcohol use. ""There are a whole variety of unhealthy behaviours related to being up late in the dark by yourself."" Malcolm von Schantz, professor of chronobiology at the University of Surrey, and another author of the paper, said the problems experienced by night owls were a ""public health issue that can no longer be ignored"". ""We should discuss allowing evening types to start and finish work later, where practical,"" he said. ""And we need more research about how we can help evening types cope with the higher effort of keeping their body clock in synchrony with sun time."" But while the study makes less than positive reading for late risers, Prof Knutson said night owls are not ""doomed"". Scientists say that about 40% to 70% of a person's circadian rhythm, or body clock, is genetic, with the rest influenced by environment and age. ""Part of it you don't have any control over and part of it you might,"" Prof Knutson said. Among the tips she and other sleep experts recommend to shift your body clock earlier are: Make sure you are exposed to light early in the morning but not at night Try to keep a regular bedtime and not let yourself drift to later bedtimes Be regimented about adopting healthy lifestyle behaviours and recognise that the timing of when you sleep matters Do things earlier and be less of an evening person as much as you can.

'Don't intimidate' mourners of burglar,"Iain Gordon pulled down floral tributes from a fence opposite the home of Richard Osborn-Brooks People laying flowers in tribute to a suspected burglar who was fatally stabbed should not feel intimidated, a senior Met Police officer says. Sir Craig Mackey, Met deputy commissioner, has also urged those placing tributes to Henry Vincent to be ""respectful"" to local people. The tributes have been repeatedly attacked and removed from a fence opposite the home where he was stabbed. Residents have described them as being ""in poor taste"". The row has put a strain on police resources, according to Sir Craig. Flowers left for burglar 'an insult' Hither Green burglary suspect hunted by Met Police What are your rights in tackling burglars? The 37-year-old, along withBill Jeeves is suspected of burgling Richard Osborn-Brooks' home on South Park Crescent- which remains cordoned off by police - on 4 April. Since Mr Vincent's death the floral tributes had been appearing on the fence opposite Mr Osborn-Brooks' home. In the middle of Monday night the flowers and balloons were taken down and placed on the pavement by an unknown man. This video can not be played A man was seen stamping on flowers and balloons left in tribute to Henry Vincent By Tuesday lunchtime the family of Mr Vincent - understood to be part of the travelling community - put them back up on the fence, however 30 minutes later a second man tore them down, put them in a pile and stamped on them. The tributes were reattached for a third time at 17:00 BST, but at 21:30 BST another man turned up and took away half of the bouquets. On Wednesday morning half of the fence was still covered with tributes, but these were stripped down at midday by another man and have been completely removed. The row has put a strain on the Met's resources, Deputy Commissioner Sir Craig Mackey says Speaking on LBC the deputy commissioner said the Met was working with Lewisham Council to work out how to manage the tributes. ""We want those laying flowers to respect the local people and the impact on them,"" he said. ""Those opposed to the flowers should act responsibly, respectfully and reasonably. ""As theborough commander said yesterdaywe don't want anyone - the local people or those visiting the scene - to feel intimidated."" Henry Vincent's family said the fence was ""the best place"" for a tribute His comments come after Lewisham's borough commander, Ch Supt Simon Dobinson, urged members of the public ""to respect the wishes of those who choose to place flowers and other tributes in the area."" Stephen Langley-Hart, 72, a former resident of South Park Crescent, said: ""They have the right to grieve even given the circumstances, but it could be done in a better way. It is really not terribly nice to have this thing opposite the house. It is a provocation. ""The police really have much better things to do than guard a flower display. They should be doing other things but I hope it is not going to escalate. I really hope they're not going to come back.""

UK launched cyber-attack on Islamic State,"This video can not be played GCHQ director Jeremy Fleming said it was the first time such an attack had been carried out The UK has conducted a ""major offensive cyber-campaign"" against the Islamic State group, the director of the intelligence agency GCHQ has revealed. The operation hindered the group's ability to co-ordinate attacks and suppressed its propaganda, former MI5 agent Jeremy Fleming said. It is the first time the UK has systematically degraded an adversary's online efforts in a military campaign. Mr Fleming made the remarks in his first public speech as GCHQ director. ""The outcomes of these operations are wide-ranging,"" he told the Cyber UK conference in Manchester. ""In 2017 there were times when Daesh [an alternative name for Islamic State] found it almost impossible to spread their hate online, to use their normal channels to spread their rhetoric, or trust their publications."" Islamic State conflict The rise and fall of Islamic State's propaganda machine IS wife: 'I want to stay in Syria' Mr Fleming said much of the cyber-operation was ""too sensitive to talk about"", but had disrupted the group's online activities and even destroyed equipment and networks. ""This campaign shows how targeted and effective offensive cyber can be,"" he added. But Mr Fleming said the fight against IS was not over, because the group continued to ""seek to carry out or inspire further attacks in the UK"" and find new ""ungoverned spaces to base their operations"". Mr Fleming also criticised Russia over what he called ""unacceptable cyber-behaviour"" that was a ""growing threat"" to the UK and its allies. He recalled the NotPetya ransomware attack on Ukraine last year, which eventually spread across the world. The UK and US later said theRussian military were behind the attack,a claim that Moscow denied. ""They're not playing to the same rules,"" Mr Fleming said. ""They're blurring the boundaries between criminal and state activity."" He said the use of anerve agent on Sergei and Yulia Skripalin Salisbury was ""stark and shocking"", and demonstrated ""how reckless Russia is prepared to be"". The UK has said Moscow was ""culpable"" for the attack, but Russia denies any any involvement. ""The robust response from the UK and from the international community shows the Kremlin that illegal acts have consequences. And it looks like our expertise on Russia will be in increasing demand,"" he said. Following the speech, the chief executive of the National Cyber Security Centre, Ciaran Martin,  told the BBC the Notpetya case was also an example of the Russian recklessness mentioned by Mr Fleming. Asked if the disclosures about offensive cyber-actions were a veiled warning to Russia, Mr Martin said sometimes the best form of defence is defence. Inspectors back UK in spy poisoning row What happened to Sergei and Yulia Skripal? Mr Fleming went on to describe some of GCHQ's other goals, which include tracking down people who use the dark web to distribute child sex abuse images. Cyber has created a new landscape for attackers and defenders, he said, and the challenges were ""vast"" but were being met by a strong and lawful GCHQ. On Wednesday, Mr Fleming announceda new GCHQ base is to open in Manchester,hoping to draw ""tech savvy recruits"". GCHQ to open a new Manchester base Rise and fall of IS propaganda machine.

What can Western action achieve?,"President Trump has signalled military intervention is likely in the near future As the US and UK governments continue to discuss their potential response tothe suspected chemical weapons attack in Douma in Syria, what could military intervention achieve? The critical military virtue of surprise has long since disappeared for theUnited States and its allies in the strikes it is planning against Syrianmilitary facilities. Indeed, Syrian forces have had more than two days to move their aircraft and other military assets into Russian bases at Latakia, Tartus and Khmeimim, where they will be within the protective bubbles of Russia's highly capable S-400 surface-to-air missiles. The Syrians have emptied their infantry bases and dispersed as much of their armed forces as possible, in anticipation of incoming Western missiles. The Russians will undoubtedly try to protect their bases, if attacked, so the situation is fraught with superpower brinkmanship and the danger of accidental conflict. For Western military planners the two greatest questions are what can they achieve militarily in this situation, and what strategic difference can it make? Theresa May summons cabinet to discuss Syria action Does Theresa May need MPs to approve UK action in Syria? Syria 'chemical attack': France's President Macron says he has proof Firepower of key countries in Syrian crisis With Syrian forces forewarned, dispersed and under Russian protection, Western strikes will have to concentrate on Syria's fixed military facilities - bombing runways, destroying buildings and capital equipment where it remains in place. This video can not be played The US president has said ""nothing's off the table"" - so what options are on the table? Western attacks will probably try to destroy Syria's military command and control system, possibly with bunker-busting bombs and deep penetration warheads. They are likely to try to dismantle the military infrastructure that Syria has effectively rebuilt since 2015. More ambitiously, and also more risky, the United States might declare a longer-term policy of revisiting these targets to keep them out of use and have Syrian aircraft bottled up inside their Russian bases - in effect trying to operate a quasi ""no-fly zone"" in Syria, at least for a while. In April 2017 the US launched 59 cruise missiles at the Shayrat airbase in response to a previous chemical weapons attack Last year when theUS struck President Assad's Shayrat airbase in retaliation for the use of chemical weapons in Khan Sheikhoun,the Syrian air force made sure it was seen to be back in action within a day. The US will be determined that this does not happen again, which is why we can expect this to be a more prolonged air campaign with repeated attacks on key sites. What strategic purpose can be served by this? It certainly won't make any immediate difference to the civil population of Syria, who have suffered so much at the hands of their own government, and the multitude of rebel, terrorist and guerrilla groups, some of whom have intimidated, as much as they have represented, them. And President Assad is unlikely to relent in his determination to consolidate his hold on the country. Why is there a war in Syria? Experts: Are we heading for a third world war? So why take all the risks of escalation with Russia and the prospects of unintended consequences that normally follow? On its own, military force is meaningless. It has to be part of a political strategy and in this case the strategy is about bigger issues than Syria itself and only offers a long-shot hope for the Syrian population. The first objective is to push back against the increasing ""normalisation"" of chemical weapons being used in wars of any kind. The taboo against them has been surprisingly strong since the end of World War One.The Chemical Weapons Convention of 1993,externalhas been one of the most effective disarmament measures in modern history. Syria is a signatory to it. In2013 President Obama claimed he would uphold that taboo as a ""red line"", but then didn't. And despite firm denials from the Assad government, there is an abundance of evidence that Syrian forces, with Russian connivance, have been using chemical weapons against their own people on a regular basis ever since. Many Western politicians feel that - with all the moral grey areas of this situation - they cannot sell the pass on this issue yet again. It has become a test case for the international rule of law, which is under severe pressure on many fronts. The World Health Organization has demanded ""unhindered access"" to Douma in Syria to verify claims about the attack Beyond that, some argue effective military action would represent an acceptance that Western powers have got to get back into the game of Middle East politics at a time when the region is melting down. The campaign against so-called Islamic State (IS) was always a geopolitical sideshow, and Western influence on what has been happening from Lebanon to the Yemen has been in steep decline. Of course, it is tempting, and understandable, for Western leaders to want to leave it all alone. But while they took their eye off the ball fighting IS, the future of the area was being determined by Iran, Russia and partly also by Turkey. Syria war: Why Turkey's battle for northern Syria matters Syria conflict: Will powers end up in direct war? The calculation is whether long-term Western interests are served better by involvement than indifference to a constellation of powers that is sliding out of control. And the hope for the Syrian population is that an effective military campaign could possibly push President Assad back into negotiations so that the war might end with something more humane than a vicious victory. Using military force is never easy, but it can only be effective if it is part of a coherent and realistic political strategy.

Officer who dragged man from plane sues,"A former Chicago aviation security officer who was fired after dragging a man off a flight last year has filed a lawsuit against the airline and city. James Long is suing Chicago's Department of Aviation (CDA), its commissioner and the city, alleging he was not trained on how to use force. He was sacked after removing David Dao from the plane last April to make room for United Airlines employees. Video footage of the incident sparked international outcry on social media. The ordeal led to demonstrations at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport and turned into a public relations disaster for United Airlines. The 69-year-old Vietnamese-American physician was forcibly removed after refusing to give up his seat to airline employees on a flight from Chicago to Louisville, Kentucky on 9 April last year. United Airlines incident: What went wrong? United Airlines' public relations disaster Dr Dao, who lost two front teeth, suffered a broken nose and a ""significant"" concussion, later reached a settlement with United Airlines for an undisclosed amount of money. The airline also apologised for how he was treated. His lawyer has said that Dr Dao found the experience ""more horrifying and harrowing than what he experienced when leaving Vietnam"". Civil rights leader Reverend Jesse Jackson led a protest at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport over the incident The airline also changed its policy on giving staff last-minute seats on full flights and said future crew members would be allocated seats at least an hour before departure. Mr Long and three other security officers were placed on administration leave after the incident. He was fired by the city in August, the lawsuit claims. According to the complaint, filed in Cook County Circuit Court on Tuesday, Mr Long claims the airline should have been aware that calling security would result in ""the use of physical force"". United blamed the incident on an overbooked flight, but later changed its policy on how to handle such cases He also alleges that although he completed five months of a police recruit training programme, the department did not provide training on the ""level of force continuum"", according to the Chicago Tribune newspaper. ""But for the CDA's negligence and failure to train [Long] how to respond to an escalating situation with an Airline Passenger, [he] would not have acted in the manner he did, which resulted in his termination,"" the complaint says, according to newspaper. This video can not be played Crystal Dao Pepper: ""We were horrified, shocked and sickened to learn what had happened"" The lawsuit also blames CDA Commissioner Ginger Evans, whom Mr Long claims defamed him in statements to US media. The former aviation officer is seeking damages over his sacking, which includes back pay and payment to his retirement plan. Bill McCaffrey, a spokesman for Chicago's department of law, told Reuters news agency he had not received the lawsuit and declined to comment further.

US weighs military response over Syria,"The US Navy guided-missile destroyer, the USS Donald Cook, is in the Mediterranean The US says ""all options are on the table"" in response to a suspected chemical weapons attack in Syria, as Western leaders continue to weigh up military action. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told reporters that a final decision on military strikes had not been taken. But she said the US holds Russia and Syria responsible for the incident. The US National Security Council is to meet on Thursday, while UK PM Theresa May has called a cabinet meeting. Western leaders appear to be gearing up for air strikes, but Russian figures have said they will retaliate against any strikes on their ally Syria. On Thursday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said it was ""very necessary to avoid any steps which could increase tensions in Syria"". Syria 'chemical attack': What we know Viewpoint: 'The world is becoming too passive' Why is there a war in Syria? At the UN Security Council, Russia and the US blocked each other's proposals for investigating claims of a chemical attack, as they disagreed over who should have the right to apportion blame. The internationalOrganisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) has said it will go to Douma,external""shortly"", but it is unclear when it would arrive and how much evidence of any chemical attack might remain. This video can not be played Unverified video shows children being treated after the alleged gas attack The town is being evacuated through a humanitarian corridor, under terms of an agreement between Russia and the rebels. The main leaders of the rebel group Jaish al-Islam have left the town, and the group's weapons have been surrendered, according to UK-based monitor the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Russian claims that the town had been taken over by Syrian forces and a government flag raised on a building could not be independently verified. Major General Yury Yevtushenko said it was a ""significant event in the history of Syria"", and meant the whole Eastern Ghouta area was in government control. ""The president has a number of options at his disposal and a number remain on the table,"" Ms Sanders said during a briefing on Wednesday evening. ""We haven't laid out any specific actions we plan to take,"" she added. The comments appear to row back on President Donald Trump's earlier warning to Russia that it should ""get ready"" for missile strikes in Syria. ""Get ready Russia, because they will be coming, nice and new and 'smart!'"" Mr Trump said in an early morning tweet on Wednesday. He also called the Syrian leader a ""gas killing animal"".

The US, UK and France have agreed to work together and are believed to be preparing for a military strike in response to the alleged chemical attack last Saturday. Defence Secretary James Mattis said the US was still assessing the chemical attack, but added that the military stood ready ""to provide military options if they are appropriate as the president determines"". The White House said the president had not laid down a specific timetable for when military strikes may take place. But a senior source has told the BBC's North America editor Jon Sopel that any military action is likely to happen at the weekend. Are we heading for a third world war? A US Navy guided-missile destroyer, the USS Donald Cook, is in the Mediterranean Sea. In the UK, sources told the BBC thatPrime Minister Theresa May looked ready to join military action in Syriawithout seeking parliamentary consent first, as she is understood to be reluctant to ask the US to hold off any action while she consults MPs. French President Emmanuel Macron will reportedly decide on a response in the coming days. He has said any strikes would target the Syrian government's ""chemical capabilities"". Other key figures have been showing signs that they anticipate strikes to happen soon. Senior US military sources say President Assad's forces have already moved some aircraft in an attempt to protect them from attacks.The New York Times reports Syrian planes have been taken to a Russian base,externalnear Latakia on the country's coast, and that some Russian personnel and equipment have also been moved. Airlines have also taken note of the situation, and no planes are visible over Syria on the commercial flight-tracking website FlightRadar24. Meanwhile, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres has warned of the need to avoid the situation ""spiralling out of control"". Activists, rescue workers and medics say dozens of people died when government aircraft dropped bombs filled with toxic chemicals on the formerly rebel-held town of Douma on Saturday. But President Bashar al-Assad's government - which receives military backing from Russia - denies being behind any chemical attack. The Syrian-American Medical Society (Sams), which operates in rebel-held areas, saidmore than 500 people had been treated for symptoms ""indicative of exposure to a chemical agent"",external. On Wednesday, the UN's World Health Organization demanded access to verify reports from its partners, which include Sams, that 70 people had died - including 43 who showed ""symptoms consistent with exposure to highly toxic chemicals"". It has described the reports of the chemical attack as a ""provocation"" designed to justify Western intervention against its ally, and accused militant rebels of fabricating it. This video can not be played The US president has said ""nothing's off the table"" - so what options are on the table? It said on Wednesday that samples taken from the site had not revealed any chemical substances. Senior Russian figures have warned of a Russian response to a US attack. On Wednesday Alexander Zasypkin, Moscow's ambassador to Lebanon, repeated a warning by the head of the military that missiles would be shot down and their launch sites targeted if they threatened the lives of Russian personnel. And Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova asked whether the aim of Western strikes might be ""to quickly remove the traces of the provocation... [so] international inspectors will have nothing to look for in terms of evidence"". Addressing new ambassadors in Moscow, President Vladimir Putin said he hoped common sense would prevail and that the situation would stabilise.

The 10 'worst' A&Es for waits revealed,"A&E waiting times have reached their highest levels in England - as a BBC analysis indentifies the services with the worst individual waits. Hospitals are meant to see 95% of patients in four hours. But the difficult winter means the NHS has recorded its worst-ever annual performance - at 88.4% - since records began in 2004, NHS England data showed. The single worst service was Princess Alexandra Hospital in Essex, which only saw 70.9% in four hours during 2017-18. This was followed by East Kent Hospitals on 74.3%. The worst performance has been seen at the major units, once NHS trusts exclude the minor injury units and walk-in centres they run. Yearly figures are not in for the rest of the UK yet, although during winter the overall performance was worse in Northern Ireland and Wales. Scotland's A&Es have been at a similar level to England's. Ian Dalton, head of NHS Improvement, which regulates the health service, said hospitals were facing a ""mammoth"" task coping with rising numbers of patients, particularly the sickest that need to be admitted on to wards. But he conceded: ""Nobody working in the NHS will be happy with the effect this has had on how quickly we have seen and treated patients.""

NHS at 70: Share your stories and memories But Dr Nick Scriven, president of the Society for Acute Medicine, said it showed the NHS was facing an ""eternal winter"" and warned it would now be difficult to catch up on the planned operations that were cancelled during the past few months. ""The fear is patients will feel the effects of this year's winter for weeks and months to come so there is a desperate need for much earlier winter planning if we are to avoid a repeat of this nightmare."" Phillippa Hentsch, of NHS Providers, which represents hospital bosses, said the figures ""underlined the urgency of the problems facing the NHS"". She said there were simply not enough ""beds and staff"". A Department of Health and Social Care spokesman praised the ""dedication of staff"", especially over the winter which saw bad weather and high levels of flu. He pointed out the prime minister had committed to coming up with a long-term funding plan - widely assumed to be a 10-year settlement - later this year which would help the health service prepare better for pressures in coming years.

Nine arrested in overnight 'gang' raids,"About 200 officers took part in the raids across west London Eight police raids across west London have struck a ""massive blow to an established gang"", the Metropolitan Police said. A submachine gun, ammunition, cash and suspected Class A drugs were seized in the raids in Northolt, Greenford, Fulham and Brentford. Nine people - including a 14-year-old boy - have been held on suspicion of drug and firearms offences. Det Insp Driss Hayoukane claimed the ""MDP"" gang had ""corrupted children"". During a search in Stephendale Road, Fulham, officers found a Skorpion submachine gun, along with another handgun, 40 rounds of ammunition, and a kilo of suspected Class A drugs, Scotland Yard said. Overall, six males and three females, aged between 14 and 49, were arrested in the early hours of Thursday and are now in custody, according to the Met. The operation was the result of about six months of planning by the Met's anti-gang Trident unit, the force said. Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick had been on patrol in Hackney on Wednesday evening Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick had been on patrol in Hackney on Wednesday evening, where she said gang tensions were high after a spate of stabbings in recent weeks, including thekilling of 18-year-old Israel Ogunsola. She said: ""They are very violent, several of them have a history of serious violence, at least one is suspected of regularly using a firearm. ""They will be arrested - not only have they been, as it appears to us, supplying crack cocaine and heroin, they've been making a huge amount of money. ""They've been exploiting vulnerable people and very young people have been engaged in the drug-dealing operation. So they need to be locked up."" West London properties in Northolt, Greenford, Fulham and Brentford were raided Asked if raids had been stepped up following a recent rise in violent crime, Det Insp Hayoukane said: ""It's business as usual for us, our unit works to capacity all the time. ""What we have taken out is probably a line which has been supplying the Earl's Court and Fulham areas. ""This gang have been running that line for quite a while and making a lot of money. ""These gangs have corrupted children and are using them to ferry drugs. ""If you look across London these are the kids that are getting involved in violence and stabbings because they are generally on the streets while the suppliers are removed from it, collecting the cash.""

Baby born four years after parents' death,"The fertilised eggs had been frozen for years A baby has been born in China to a surrogate mother four years after his parents died in a car crash, Chinese media reported. The couple, who died in 2013, had frozen several embryos hoping to have a child through IVF. After the accident, their parents fought a protracted legal battle to be allowed to use the embryos. The boy was born in December to a surrogate from Laos and The Beijing News first reported the case this week. The newspaper explained how the lack of precedent for a case of this kind had forced the deceased couple's parents through a legal minefield before the surrogacy could proceed. At the time of the accident, the embryos were stored safely in a Nanjing hospital, frozen at minus 196 degrees in a liquid nitrogen tank. A court battle gave the four grandparents-to-be the right over the fertilised eggs. There was no precedent as to whether they could inherit their children's frozen embryos, according to reports. The grandparents say they were thrilled their bloodline would be continued (file photo) They were eventually granted the embryos, but it wasn't long until the next problem occurred. The embryos could only be taken from the Nanjing hospital if there was proof that another hospital would store them. But given the legal uncertainty around untransplanted embryos, it was hard to find another medical institution in China willing to get involved. And with surrogacy illegal in China, the only realistic option was to look beyond the country's borders. Eventually, the future grandparents worked with a surrogacy agency and decided on Laos, where commercial surrogacy was legal. As no airline was willing to accept a thermos-sized bottle of liquid nitrogen, the precious cargo had to be transported by car. In Laos, the embryo was implanted into the womb of the surrogate mother and in December 2017 the boy was born. Citizenship of the child, named Tiantian, was another problem though and so he was born not in Laos but in China - with the surrogate travelling there on a simple tourist visa. With no parents left to prove paternity, all four grandparents had to give blood and take DNA tests to establish that the baby was indeed their grandson and that both parents had been Chinese nationals.

EDF raises electricity prices by 2.7%,"EDF Energy is raising its electricity prices by 2.7%, days after British Gas raised prices for 4.1 million of its customers. EDF's move, which will affect 1.3 million customers, will see electricity prices rise, but gas prices remain unchanged from 7 June. As a result, typical standard dual-fuel customers will see their bill rise by 1.4%, or Â£16 a year. That would bring the typical annual bill for them to Â£1,158 a year. A customer who pays by cash or cheque, rather than by direct debit, will see their typical annual bill rise by Â£28 a year to Â£1,248. BÃ©atrice Bigois, EDF Energy managing director of customers, said: ""We know that price rises are not welcome and we have worked to offset rising energy and policy charges by cutting our own costs. ""We will be writing to affected customers this month to encourage them to choose a fixed-price tariff or to pay by direct debit to save on their bills."" The company said that the price rise ""reflected the increase in some of the fixed costs associated with supplying electricity"". British Gas price rise unjustified, says government Energy bills to rise for five million on price cap The price rise comes after EDF raised electricity prices twice last year, putting them up by 8.4% in March and 9% in June. The latest change has been announced two days after the UK's largest domestic energy supplier, British Gas, said it would raise gas and electricity prices by 5.5%, or Â£60 a year, for customers on default deals from 29 May. That price rise was branded as ""unjustified"" by the government. Stephen Murray, from price comparison website Moneysupermarket, said: ""Clearly the price rise from British Gas earlier this week has opened the floodgates and we are now officially in price rise season. ""It is fair to say the forthcoming energy price cap, even though it is still months from being signed off and introduced, is looking like a key factor in this round of price rises. The big six suppliers know they have a short window to adjust prices upwards before the government starts to enforce pricing legislation.""

Cabinet to discuss Syria military actionMinisters are expected to back her call to join military action by the US and its allies.11m11 minutes agoUK Politics,"In April 2017 the US launched cruise missiles at a Syrian airbase after a chemical weapons attack Cabinet ministers have agreed ""on the need to take action"" in Syria to ""deter the further use of chemical weapons"", Downing Street has said. Ministers at a cabinet meeting said it was ""highly likely"" the Assad regime was responsible for a suspected chemical attack. They agreed that the use of chemical weapons must not ""go unchallenged"". But Transport Minister Jo Johnson later stressed: ""There has been no decision to take military action at this point."" No details of UK involvement in any military action in Syria were mentioned in the Downing Street statement. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has accused the government of ""waiting for instructions"" from US President Donald Trump and said military action was unlikely to solve the situation in Syria. He said: ""More bombing, more killing, more war will not save life. It will just take more lives and spawn the war elsewhere."" Medical sources say dozens of people were killed, including children, during the alleged toxic bombing of the formerly rebel-held town of Douma, in the Eastern Ghouta region. Russia warns of 'dangerous' escalation over Syria What can Western military intervention achieve? Syria 'chemical attack': What we know President Trump spoke to the prime minister on Thursday evening, and the pair agreed that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad had ""established a pattern of dangerous behaviour in relation to the use of chemical weapons"". A statement from Downing Street added: ""They agreed to keep working closely together on the international response."" President Trump is expected to speak to French President Emmanuel Macron about what form action could take, with the White House saying ""no final decision has been made"". BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said it was understood the UK was planning a genuinely joint effort with the US and France, rather than playing a supporting role. Sources say the PM is prepared to take action against the Assad regime without first seeking parliamentary consent. Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson, Home Secretary Amber Rudd and Environment Secretary Michael Gove leave the meeting at No 10 There have been calls from opposition parties and some Conservative MPs for Parliament to have a vote beforehand. Labour's shadow home secretary Diane Abbott told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""It would be outrageous for the government not to bring military action in Syria to Parliament - for Parliament to have a vote... ""The reason they're not doing it is they are frightened they'll lose the vote."" Mrs May has said ""all the indications"" are that the Syrian regime of president Bashar al-Assad, which denies mounting a chemical attack, was responsible for the alleged attack in the formerly rebel-held town of Douma.

This video can not be played Should Parliament have a vote on Syria strikes? By Chris Buckler, BBC US correspondent Theresa May and Donald Trump spoke on the phone late on Thursday The diplomatic discussions are starting to feel like part of a waiting game. The White House insists that final decisions have still to be made. However, in their phone call, President Trump and Mrs May agreed it was vital action was taken to deter President Assad's forces from using chemical weapons. Evidence is still being gathered, but US officials are understood to have results from blood and urine samples that indicate chlorine and a nerve agent were used in the Syrian town of Douma. But they privately admit they can't be 100% sure. And with Russia threatening retaliation - and warning of the risk of some kind of conflict with the US - there is pressure to develop a wider strategy, alongside any plan for military strikes. Downing Street said the cabinet had ""agreed it was vital that the use of chemical weapons did not go unchallenged"" and ""on the need to take action to alleviate humanitarian distress and to deter the further use of chemical weapons by the Assad regime"". ""Cabinet agreed the prime minister should continue to work with allies in the United States and France to coordinate an international response,"" the statement added.

He told BBC's Newsnight: ""A very important red line has been crossed by the use of chemical weapons by the Assad regime, and we, the United Kingdom, have a very strong national interest in defending this rules-based international order.

Homeless family lived for years in hotelA council is told by the ombudsman to pay compensation after refusing their housing applications.9m9 minutes agoBristol,"This video can not be played Father Luke Burns describes his family's three years living in hotels A homeless family shared a hotel room for more than three years after a council made mistakes with their housing application, an ombudsman said. Luke and Olga Burns rented the rooms without cooking facilities while Bristol City Council repeatedly refused them a place on the housing register. The council has apologised after an investigation criticised its housing and children's services' departments. The ombudsman said the authority should pay the family Â£9,000 in compensation. Mr and Mrs Burns say they rented rooms in 12 different Premier Inns using their housing benefit and money from relatives after they were evicted from their privately-rented flat because of flood damage. An investigation by the Local Government and Social Care Ombudsman said the couple, who then had two children, first asked the city council for help in April 2014. After the birth of their third child, it said the authority still refused to assess their needs. The council deemed the Burns family ""intentionally homeless"" after they refused temporary accommodation The ombudsman also criticised the council for trying to charge the family for storing their belongings. It said the family had found private lets but lost the properties because the council took too long to consider their requests help to pay the deposit. In a joint statement, homes and communities councillor Paul Smith and families councillor Helen Goodwin apologised and said: ""While we recognise that the situation was unacceptable for a family with young children, we do believe that we tried to do our best for the family on a number of occasions."" Speaking to the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme, Mr Smith said: ""The family came from outside Bristol into a hotel and then contacted us. ""At one stage they were deemed to be intentionally homeless because they refused offers of temporary accommodation but we did not act properly, particularly in relation to the children and their needs, and there are real issues there which we have addressed."" The ombudsman said the council had agreed to wipe off the contribution the father agreed to make for storage costs and said the council should pay Â£9,000 for the delay and distress caused.

Rebel Wilson to recoup defamation case fees,"Rebel Wilson was awarded Australia's largest defamation payout last year Actress Rebel Wilson will recoup an additional sum for legal costs after being awarded Australia's largest defamation payout, a court has ruled. Ms Wilson successfully sued publisher Bauer Medialast year over magazine articles that she said portrayed her as a serial liar. Bauer has appealed against the A$4.5m (Â£2.5m; $3.5m) payout. On Thursday, the court confirmed the publisher would also have to pay most of the Hollywood actress's legal fees. Australian media reported the costs were likely to exceed A$1m after the Supreme Court of Victoria rejected Ms Wilson's initial bid for A$1.4m. The exact sum will be negotiated in a separate court. The size of the defamation payout has generated debate in Australia over whether it could stifle journalism that is in the public interest. Ms Wilson has said the articles, published in 2015, contained ""grubby and completely false"" allegations that she had lied about her name, age and upbringing in Australia. She said the stories damaged her career in Hollywood, where she has starred in films including Pitch Perfect and Bridesmaids. Bauer had argued the articles were not defamatory, but a jury sided with the actress. She immediately vowed to give her payout to charity. The publisher's appeal is due to be heard next week. Last month, six Australian media firms lost a bidto appeal against the payout on public interest grounds, after a judge ruled it was not sufficiently different to Bauer's appeal.

UK carries out cyber-attack on Islamic State,"This video can not be played GCHQ director Jeremy Fleming said it was the first time such an attack had been carried out The UK has conducted a ""major offensive cyber-campaign"" against the Islamic State group, the director of the intelligence agency GCHQ has revealed. The operation hindered the group's ability to co-ordinate attacks and suppressed its propaganda, former MI5 agent Jeremy Fleming said. It is the first time the UK has systematically degraded an adversary's online efforts in a military campaign. Mr Fleming made the remarks in his first public speech as GCHQ director. ""The outcomes of these operations are wide-ranging,"" he told the Cyber UK conference in Manchester. ""In 2017 there were times when Daesh [an alternative name for Islamic State] found it almost impossible to spread their hate online, to use their normal channels to spread their rhetoric, or trust their publications."" Islamic State conflict The rise and fall of Islamic State's propaganda machine IS wife: 'I want to stay in Syria' Mr Fleming said much of the cyber-operation was ""too sensitive to talk about"", but had disrupted the group's online activities and even destroyed equipment and networks. ""This campaign shows how targeted and effective offensive cyber can be,"" he added. But Mr Fleming said the fight against IS was not over, because the group continued to ""seek to carry out or inspire further attacks in the UK"" and find new ""ungoverned spaces to base their operations"". Mr Fleming also criticised Russia over what he called ""unacceptable cyber-behaviour"" that was a ""growing threat"" to the UK and its allies. He recalled the NotPetya ransomware attack on Ukraine last year, which eventually spread across the world. The UK and US later said theRussian military were behind the attack,a claim that Moscow denied. ""They're not playing to the same rules,"" Mr Fleming said. ""They're blurring the boundaries between criminal and state activity."" He said the use of anerve agent on Sergei and Yulia Skripalin Salisbury was ""stark and shocking"", and demonstrated ""how reckless Russia is prepared to be"". The UK has said Moscow was ""culpable"" for the attack, but Russia denies any any involvement. ""The robust response from the UK and from the international community shows the Kremlin that illegal acts have consequences. And it looks like our expertise on Russia will be in increasing demand,"" he said. Following the speech, the chief executive of the National Cyber Security Centre, Ciaran Martin,  told the BBC the Notpetya case was also an example of the Russian recklessness mentioned by Mr Fleming. Asked if the disclosures about offensive cyber-actions were a veiled warning to Russia, Mr Martin said sometimes the best form of defence is defence. Inspectors back UK in spy poisoning row What happened to Sergei and Yulia Skripal? Mr Fleming went on to describe some of GCHQ's other goals, which include tracking down people who use the dark web to distribute child sex abuse images. Cyber has created a new landscape for attackers and defenders, he said, and the challenges were ""vast"" but were being met by a strong and lawful GCHQ. On Wednesday, Mr Fleming announceda new GCHQ base is to open in Manchester,hoping to draw ""tech savvy recruits"". GCHQ to open a new Manchester base Rise and fall of IS propaganda machine.

Nine arrested in overnight 'gang' raidsA 14-year-old boy was among those arrested by police in the raids across west London.1h40 minutes agoLondon,"About 200 officers took part in the raids across west London Eight police raids across west London have struck a ""massive blow to an established gang"", the Metropolitan Police said. A submachine gun, ammunition, cash and suspected Class A drugs were seized in the raids in Northolt, Greenford, Fulham and Brentford. Nine people - including a 14-year-old boy - have been held on suspicion of drug and firearms offences. Det Insp Driss Hayoukane claimed the ""MDP"" gang had ""corrupted children"". During a search in Stephendale Road, Fulham, officers found a Skorpion submachine gun, along with another handgun, 40 rounds of ammunition, and a kilo of suspected Class A drugs, Scotland Yard said. Overall, six males and three females, aged between 14 and 49, were arrested in the early hours of Thursday and are now in custody, according to the Met. The operation was the result of about six months of planning by the Met's anti-gang Trident unit, the force said. Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick had been on patrol in Hackney on Wednesday evening Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick had been on patrol in Hackney on Wednesday evening, where she said gang tensions were high after a spate of stabbings in recent weeks, including thekilling of 18-year-old Israel Ogunsola. She said: ""They are very violent, several of them have a history of serious violence, at least one is suspected of regularly using a firearm. ""They will be arrested - not only have they been, as it appears to us, supplying crack cocaine and heroin, they've been making a huge amount of money. ""They've been exploiting vulnerable people and very young people have been engaged in the drug-dealing operation. So they need to be locked up."" West London properties in Northolt, Greenford, Fulham and Brentford were raided Asked if raids had been stepped up following a recent rise in violent crime, Det Insp Hayoukane said: ""It's business as usual for us, our unit works to capacity all the time. ""What we have taken out is probably a line which has been supplying the Earl's Court and Fulham areas. ""This gang have been running that line for quite a while and making a lot of money. ""These gangs have corrupted children and are using them to ferry drugs. ""If you look across London these are the kids that are getting involved in violence and stabbings because they are generally on the streets while the suppliers are removed from it, collecting the cash.""

"Burned home's steep cost raises eyebrowsThe home, which was gutted by fire two years ago, is listed on the market for $800,000 (Â£565,000).","The home was gutted by a fire two years ago A Silicon Valley real estate agent is defending the price of a fire-ravaged home that is listed on the market for $800,000 (Â£565,000). The San Jose house, which sits on a 5,800 sq ft lot in California's San Francisco Bay Area, was the site of a major fire two years ago. The listing, announced on the agent's Facebook page, quickly drew criticism. San Francisco housing prices have risen dramatically in recent years due to proximity to nearby technology firms. ""Unchecked free market capitalism,"" one commenter complained. ""Posting a dumpster with a roof in Facebook for 800,000 is begging to get trolled,"" another social media user wrote. But Willow Glen Charm real estate agent Holly Barr said the land is what makes the property so valuable, as well as its proximity to nearby technology companies such as Facebook and Google. ""If you are in the market you know real estate you know that this is what it's worth and the buyers set the price,""Ms Barr told KTVU-TV,external. She added that she has already received several offers, and predicts that a bidding war may break out soon. Rick Smith of Santa Clara County Association of Realtors told the station: ""I'm not surprised at all."" The median price for a single-family home in the area is $1.4 million, he noted. According to NBC News,external, houses in San Jose gain nearly $571 in value every day due to rising costs and fewer homes for sale in the area. Over a year, that equals over $200,000 in new equity, the news outlet reports. Sacred Heart Community Services spokesman Darren Seaton told the network that he fears that the high cost will hurt more than just homeowners' wallets. ""A home looks like it makes more than a schoolteacher here in San Jose,"" Mr Seaton told NBC. ""As housing continues to skyrocket, it's going to make it more difficult to survive in Silicon Valley."" Where house prices rose fastest in 2017 Where can I afford to live?

During Thursday's cabinet meeting called to discuss the UK response, she described it as ""shocking and barbaric"" and said it was a ""further example of the erosion of international law in relation to the use of chemical weapons, which was deeply concerning to us all"". This video can not be played Should Parliament have a vote on Syria strikes? By Chris Buckler, BBC US correspondent Theresa May and Donald Trump spoke on the phone late on Thursday The diplomatic discussions are starting to feel like part of a waiting game. The White House insists that final decisions have still to be made. However, in their phone call, President Trump and Mrs May agreed it was vital action was taken to deter President Assad's forces from using chemical weapons. Evidence is still being gathered, but US officials are understood to have results from blood and urine samples that indicate chlorine and a nerve agent were used in the Syrian town of Douma. But they privately admit they can't be 100% sure. And with Russia threatening retaliation - and warning of the risk of some kind of conflict with the US - there is pressure to develop a wider strategy, alongside any plan for military strikes. Downing Street said the cabinet had ""agreed it was vital that the use of chemical weapons did not go unchallenged"" and ""on the need to take action to alleviate humanitarian distress and to deter the further use of chemical weapons by the Assad regime"". ""Cabinet agreed the prime minister should continue to work with allies in the United States and France to coordinate an international response,"" the statement added.

He told BBC's Newsnight: ""A very important red line has been crossed by the use of chemical weapons by the Assad regime, and we, the United Kingdom, have a very strong national interest in defending this rules-based international order. ""We shouldn't just rely on the Americans to do that for us. We have as strong an interest as they do."" Syria decision looms for May Do MPs need to approve UK action in Syria?

Burned home's steep cost raises eyebrows,"The home was gutted by a fire two years ago A Silicon Valley real estate agent is defending the price of a fire-ravaged home that is listed on the market for $800,000 (Â£565,000). The San Jose house, which sits on a 5,800 sq ft lot in California's San Francisco Bay Area, was the site of a major fire two years ago. The listing, announced on the agent's Facebook page, quickly drew criticism. San Francisco housing prices have risen dramatically in recent years due to proximity to nearby technology firms. ""Unchecked free market capitalism,"" one commenter complained. ""Posting a dumpster with a roof in Facebook for 800,000 is begging to get trolled,"" another social media user wrote. But Willow Glen Charm real estate agent Holly Barr said the land is what makes the property so valuable, as well as its proximity to nearby technology companies such as Facebook and Google. ""If you are in the market you know real estate you know that this is what it's worth and the buyers set the price,""Ms Barr told KTVU-TV,external. She added that she has already received several offers, and predicts that a bidding war may break out soon. Rick Smith of Santa Clara County Association of Realtors told the station: ""I'm not surprised at all."" The median price for a single-family home in the area is $1.4 million, he noted. According to NBC News,external, houses in San Jose gain nearly $571 in value every day due to rising costs and fewer homes for sale in the area. Over a year, that equals over $200,000 in new equity, the news outlet reports. Sacred Heart Community Services spokesman Darren Seaton told the network that he fears that the high cost will hurt more than just homeowners' wallets. ""A home looks like it makes more than a schoolteacher here in San Jose,"" Mr Seaton told NBC. ""As housing continues to skyrocket, it's going to make it more difficult to survive in Silicon Valley."" Where house prices rose fastest in 2017 Where can I afford to live?

"Rebel Wilson to recoup defamation case feesAfter winning Australia's largest payout of its kind, the actress sought to recover her sizeable legal costs.6h6 hours agoAustralia","Rebel Wilson was awarded Australia's largest defamation payout last year Actress Rebel Wilson will recoup an additional sum for legal costs after being awarded Australia's largest defamation payout, a court has ruled. Ms Wilson successfully sued publisher Bauer Medialast year over magazine articles that she said portrayed her as a serial liar. Bauer has appealed against the A$4.5m (Â£2.5m; $3.5m) payout. On Thursday, the court confirmed the publisher would also have to pay most of the Hollywood actress's legal fees. Australian media reported the costs were likely to exceed A$1m after the Supreme Court of Victoria rejected Ms Wilson's initial bid for A$1.4m. The exact sum will be negotiated in a separate court. The size of the defamation payout has generated debate in Australia over whether it could stifle journalism that is in the public interest. Ms Wilson has said the articles, published in 2015, contained ""grubby and completely false"" allegations that she had lied about her name, age and upbringing in Australia. She said the stories damaged her career in Hollywood, where she has starred in films including Pitch Perfect and Bridesmaids. Bauer had argued the articles were not defamatory, but a jury sided with the actress. She immediately vowed to give her payout to charity. The publisher's appeal is due to be heard next week. Last month, six Australian media firms lost a bidto appeal against the payout on public interest grounds, after a judge ruled it was not sufficiently different to Bauer's appeal.

"Rate rise doubts as property demand fallsFewer people moving home means less spending making May's interest rate decision harder, surveyors say.10h10 hours agoBusinessComments","A lack of activity in the UK housing market could make it more difficult for Bank of England policymakers to raise interest rates, surveyors have said. There has been widespread speculation of a potential increase in the Bank rate in May from its level of 0.5%. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) said property buyer demand had fallen for its 12th consecutive month in March. This could mean slower household spending as fewer people move home. Simon Rubinsohn, chief economist at RICS, said that there was little sign of any potential pick-up in buyer demand. ""Apart from the implications this has for the market itself, it also has the potential to impact the wider economy, contributing to a softer trend in household spending,"" he said. ""This could make Bank of England deliberations around a May hike in interest rates, which is pretty much odds-on at the moment, a little more finely balanced than would otherwise be the case."" Interest rates: What would a rise mean for you? Moving home is 'becoming a rarity' How to give your finances a spring clean to save money Your biggest financial decision - in 10 charts Across the UK, 9.2 million households have a mortgage. Of these, about half are on a standard variable rate or a tracker rate, and they would most likely be affected by a rise in the Bank rate. However, these figures, as well as anunexpected 0.2% fall in UK manufacturing outputin February, do mean that the UK economy may not be growing as fast as predicted, making an interest rate rise less inevitable. Demand for property and house price changes vary considerably across the UK. London is seeing the sharpest fall in prices, according to surveyors. Respondents in the South East of England, East Anglia and the North East of England also reported prices to be falling, but to a lesser extent than in London. Prices increased elsewhere in the UK in the last three months. Surveyors predicted that in a year's time, house prices would be higher, particularly in the North West of England, Wales and Scotland. London remained the only region in which surveyors expected prices to be lower in one year's time. This interactive content requires an internet connection and a modern browser.

Carpetright to close a quarter of stores,"Carpetright says it is closing 92 stores and cutting 300 jobs as part of a restructuring plan. The retailer recently started talks with lenders to ensure it does not breach the terms of its bank loans. The chain is planning a company voluntary arrangement (CVA) that will allow it to shut the worst-performing stores and ask for rent concessions on another 113 sites. It is the latest in a long list of businesses to run into trouble. Retailers are being pummelled as fewer people are moving home, which means lower demand for new flooring. Consumers are also having to tighten their belts as inflation has outstripped wage growth. Many retailers are also struggling to adjust to the shift from in-store shopping to buying goods online. Is your Carpetright store closing? Six reasons behind the High Street crisis High Street stores open at lowest rate in seven years Carpetright, which has more than 400 UK shops, has been struggling with underperforming outlets which have made its rental costs harder to shoulder. There have been similar, recent CVA arrangements atfashion retailer New Lookand restaurant chains Jamie's Italian, Prezzo and Byron. Analysis:Kevin Peachey, BBC personal finance reporter The plight of Carpetright is not only a story of the struggling High Street, but also a tale of what is going on in the streets and avenues nearby. TheBBC recently revealedthat homeowners are moving house half as often as they did before the financial crisis. Now,figures from surveyorshave shown 12 consecutive months of falling demand from property buyers, with little sign of a turnaround. So, with fewer people moving in to a new place, there is less demand for new fittings such as carpets and curtains. The squeeze on household finances means many of those staying put are delaying their plans to redecorate. That is why the furniture store sales seem never to end, and why this sector is trying to find new ways to attract customers. As part of its announcement on Thursday, it also said it had identified a ""technical breach"" in its borrowing agreement. The company said it would raise Â£60m through a placing of new shares, which would raise money to cut debt and pay for the restructuring plan. After initially falling by almost a quarter, shares in Carpetright were down 4.4% at 40.1p in morning trading. The CVA needs approval from creditors, which it will seek at a meeting on 26 April, and it will then hold a meeting with shareholders to ask for their approval on 30 April. The company gave a profit warning at the beginning of March. It added that trading conditions had remained difficult since then, but that it still expected to make only a small underlying pre-tax loss for the year. Wilf Walsh, Carpetright chief executive, said: ""These tough but necessary actions will enable us to address the burden of a legacy UK property estate consisting of too many poorly located stores on unsustainable rents and are essential if we are to restore our profitability and deliver a successful turnaround."" In other retail developments: Mothercare said its sales had fallen despite a rise in online sales.The retailer reported like-for-like sales fell 2.8% in the last 12 weeks owing to decreased consumer footfall.

'Big players' invest in UK space engine,"Sabre would work like a jet engine in the lower atmosphere and like a rocket motor in the high atmosphere Reaction Engines Limited (REL), the UK company developing a revolutionary aerospace engine, has announced investments from both Boeing and Rolls-Royce. REL, based at Culham in Oxfordshire, is working on a propulsion system that is part jet engine, part rocket engine. The company believes it will transform the space launch market and usher in hypersonic travel around the Earth. The new investments amount to Â£26.5m. Included in this sum are contributions from Baillie Gifford Asset Management and Woodford Investment Management. It lifts the total capital raised in the past three years to about Â£100m. The British government has already put in Â£60m. BAE Systems initially injected Â£20m in 2015 and has invested new funds in this latest financial round. ""Rolls-Royce and Boeing - these are really big names, and it's fantastic to be in this position,"" said REL CEO Mark Thomas. ""Rolls are super-positive about the technology. They want us to be independent and innovative, and to push our technology as hard as possible. And Boeing - that's amazing. They are the world's biggest aerospace company, have decades of expertise and future plans that, for us I'm sure, will be really exciting,"" he told BBC News. Pre-cooler development was subject to an independent technical audit from the European Space Agency REL is developing what it calls the Sabre engine. This power plant is designed to push a vehicle from a standing start all the way to orbit in a single step. It would work like a conventional jet engine up to about Mach 5.5 (5.5 times the speed of sound) before then transitioning to a rocket mode for the rest of the ascent. Key technologies include a compact pre-cooler heat-exchanger that can take an incoming airstream of over 1,000C and cool it to -150C in less than 1/100th of a second. This would permit Sabre to use oxygen direct from the atmosphere for combustion instead of carrying it in a tank with the weight penalty that implies. Although Sabre is usually talked about in the context of an orbiting spaceplane, it could also be fitted to a vehicle that flies at very high speed from point to point on the Earth's surface. This is an application that clearly interests Boeing, whose investment arm, HorizonX Ventures, is driving the tie-up in what is its first investment in a UK-based company. ""As Reaction Engines unlocks advanced propulsion that could change the future of air and space travel, we expect to leverage their revolutionary technology to support Boeing's pursuit of hypersonic flight,"" said HorizonX vice president, Steve Nordlund. REL should get the keys to its future test facility at Westcott in the summer Those who have followed the REL story over the years will be aware that Rolls-Royce is not really a newcomer to the project. The aero-engine giant was involved in Sabre's precursor years - a spaceplane concept back in the 1980s known as Hotol. When that hit technical difficulties, Rolls-Royce let its interest go, as did British Aerospace. Both are now back, the latter in its current guise as BAE Systems. ""We are delighted to become a strategic investor in Reaction Engines Limited, an innovative UK company that is helping push the boundaries of aviation technology,"" Rolls' CTO Paul Stein said in a statement. ""We look forward to working with REL and assisting with the development of their technology, and we plan to incorporate this technology into our own future products."" REL is approaching important demonstration milestones. In Colorado this summer, it will begin further testing of the pre-cooler technology, confronting it with conditions that simulate the very hot airstreams encountered when vehicles move at hypersonic speeds. This will be done under contract with the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). Sabre engines could be fitted to reusable flight vehicles in the next decade Also this summer, REL should take control of its new test facility in the UK at Westcott in Buckinghamshire. It is here that the company will mount a demonstration in 2020 of the full Sabre cycle. Assuming this goes well, REL would then look to put the technology on some kind of flight vehicle. The company is expanding fast with more than 160 staff at its Culham HQ. The new investments will allow it to continue the recruitment. ""The team here is outstanding. We have some of the most talented engineers I've ever worked with, a high percentage of whom are women engineers; and we have a great apprenticeship programme. It feels like we're a good-news story and I want to keep it that way,"" said Mark Thomas.

Leader Jeremy Corbyn will say ""young people deserve a break"" as he launches the policy in Derby on Thursday. The Conservatives said it was ""another promise from Labour that they have no real ability to deliver"". The policy would also apply for bus services under councils who franchised them out. Providing government funding to councils for free bus travel could help up to 13 million young people save as much as Â£1,000 a year, according to Labour. The proposal only relates to young people in England because bus policy in Scotland and Wales is handled by those nations' respective parliaments. However, the party said it had costed the proposal for the whole of the UK and it would be a decision for the devolved governments if they would follow suit. In his speech, Mr Corbyn will say young people ""tend to be in lower paid, more insecure work, and they spend a higher proportion of their income on travel"". ""Giving them free bus travel will make a huge difference to their lives,"" he will add. Most local bus services were run by council-owned companies until the 1980s when the market was opened up to private competition by the Conservative government. Shadow transport secretary Andy McDonald will repeat Labour's pledge to return to municipal bus companies if it wins power. ""We'll encourage local authorities to take back control of their buses so they can provide a better and more sustainable service to young and old alike, wherever they live,"" he will say. Bus fares in England have risen by an average of 2.9% each year between 2012 and 2017 -  which is higher than the typical rate of inflation (2.3%), Department for Transport figures show. The annual number of passenger journeys fell by 1.5%, or 70 million, in the year ending March 2017 compared with the previous 12 months. Conservative transport minister Nusrat Ghani said: ""Last election Labour promised to pay off student debt if elected and then admitted it would actually cost too much to do. Now they're bribing young people again with yet another empty promise."" The government istrialling railcards for 26-to-30-year-olds""to help with the cost of travel"" but faced some criticism when only 10,000 were released on the launch date last month, equating to just one for every 500 of the eligible population.

Officer who dragged man from plane suesThe ex-officer who was fired after the United Airlines incident alleges he was not properly trained.6h6 hours agoUS & Canada,"A former Chicago aviation security officer who was fired after dragging a man off a flight last year has filed a lawsuit against the airline and city. James Long is suing Chicago's Department of Aviation (CDA), its commissioner and the city, alleging he was not trained on how to use force. He was sacked after removing David Dao from the plane last April to make room for United Airlines employees. Video footage of the incident sparked international outcry on social media. The ordeal led to demonstrations at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport and turned into a public relations disaster for United Airlines. The 69-year-old Vietnamese-American physician was forcibly removed after refusing to give up his seat to airline employees on a flight from Chicago to Louisville, Kentucky on 9 April last year. United Airlines incident: What went wrong? United Airlines' public relations disaster Dr Dao, who lost two front teeth, suffered a broken nose and a ""significant"" concussion, later reached a settlement with United Airlines for an undisclosed amount of money. The airline also apologised for how he was treated. His lawyer has said that Dr Dao found the experience ""more horrifying and harrowing than what he experienced when leaving Vietnam"". Civil rights leader Reverend Jesse Jackson led a protest at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport over the incident The airline also changed its policy on giving staff last-minute seats on full flights and said future crew members would be allocated seats at least an hour before departure. Mr Long and three other security officers were placed on administration leave after the incident. He was fired by the city in August, the lawsuit claims. According to the complaint, filed in Cook County Circuit Court on Tuesday, Mr Long claims the airline should have been aware that calling security would result in ""the use of physical force"". United blamed the incident on an overbooked flight, but later changed its policy on how to handle such cases He also alleges that although he completed five months of a police recruit training programme, the department did not provide training on the ""level of force continuum"", according to the Chicago Tribune newspaper. ""But for the CDA's negligence and failure to train [Long] how to respond to an escalating situation with an Airline Passenger, [he] would not have acted in the manner he did, which resulted in his termination,"" the complaint says, according to newspaper. This video can not be played Crystal Dao Pepper: ""We were horrified, shocked and sickened to learn what had happened"" The lawsuit also blames CDA Commissioner Ginger Evans, whom Mr Long claims defamed him in statements to US media. The former aviation officer is seeking damages over his sacking, which includes back pay and payment to his retirement plan. Bill McCaffrey, a spokesman for Chicago's department of law, told Reuters news agency he had not received the lawsuit and declined to comment further.

"Rebel Wilson to recoup defamation case feesAfter winning Australia's largest payout of its kind, the actress sought to recover her sizeable legal costs.2h2 hours agoAustralia","Rebel Wilson was awarded Australia's largest defamation payout last year Actress Rebel Wilson will recoup an additional sum for legal costs after being awarded Australia's largest defamation payout, a court has ruled. Ms Wilson successfully sued publisher Bauer Medialast year over magazine articles that she said portrayed her as a serial liar. Bauer has appealed against the A$4.5m (Â£2.5m; $3.5m) payout. On Thursday, the court confirmed the publisher would also have to pay most of the Hollywood actress's legal fees. Australian media reported the costs were likely to exceed A$1m after the Supreme Court of Victoria rejected Ms Wilson's initial bid for A$1.4m. The exact sum will be negotiated in a separate court. The size of the defamation payout has generated debate in Australia over whether it could stifle journalism that is in the public interest. Ms Wilson has said the articles, published in 2015, contained ""grubby and completely false"" allegations that she had lied about her name, age and upbringing in Australia. She said the stories damaged her career in Hollywood, where she has starred in films including Pitch Perfect and Bridesmaids. Bauer had argued the articles were not defamatory, but a jury sided with the actress. She immediately vowed to give her payout to charity. The publisher's appeal is due to be heard next week. Last month, six Australian media firms lost a bidto appeal against the payout on public interest grounds, after a judge ruled it was not sufficiently different to Bauer's appeal.

Pienaar: Why May is ready to act,"It's an understatement to say Theresa May tends not to rush into difficult, sensitive decisions. She's spent pretty much her entire premiership living on a diet of awkward dilemmas and tough decisions. In just about every case, the May way has been to chew thoroughly before swallowing. Just now she's having to chew over two tough decisions; will she join military strikes against the forces of the Assad regime in Syria - her first decision to attack another sovereign state - and, secondly, will she seek Parliamentary approval in advance? I'm hearing authoritatively that the answers are yes, and, in all probability, no. The Syria crisis is in some ways as tough as it gets. Does Theresa May need MPs to approve UK action in Syria? Syria 'chemical attack': What we know Why is there a war in Syria? The prime minister's instinct is to chew carefully on the decision of whether and how Britain should support action in response to the apparent chemical attack in Syria. She still speaks of the need to act ""if"" not ""as"" the Assad regime is responsible. But the uncomfortable truth is the form of action is beyond her control. That decision sits in the Oval Office of the White House, and President Trump has already helpfully warned Russia to look out, because the missiles are coming to punish the illegal use of chemical weapons. There's no serious doubt Theresa May wants Britain to be involved in any military action - she as good as said as much today when she spoke about the need to ""prevent and deter"" any future chemical attack in Syria, which clearly implied punishment. And, remember, a lot of British credibility and influence as a global player is seen as being tied up in this. Handling Parliament is a delicate task. Yes,David Cameron tried and conspicuously failedto get the endorsement of the House of Commons for action in response to a chemical strike in 2013. That defeat still burns in Tory memories. Jeremy Corbyn issaying Parliament should always have a say in military action. Not all Tories support British military involvement. But there's no legal or constitutional requirement to seek advance consent at Westminster for a strike. Action can be ordered using prerogative powers. And some in government believe that it will. If the prime minister acts first and consults Parliament later, she can expect a hostile reaction from her opponents. They'll accuse the prime minister of dancing to the President's tune.His latest tweets didn't help, and landed with quite a thud in Whitehall. It's looking harder each day for Mrs May to keep up let alone keep in step with President Trump. Today, Mrs May ducked question of recalling Parliament. But I'm picking up the sense inside government that Mrs May's may just see consulting Parliament, in advance of action, as a luxury she can't afford. A recall of Parliament takes time, usually a couple of days. Mrs May is said to see action as urgent, for the sake of heading off another chemical attack. And, though I doubt she'd put it like this, she's thought by some insiders to be reluctant to ask her ally in the White House to hold off while she squares opinion at Westminster. For a naturally cautious leader like Mrs May this would be difficult at the best of times - and these are far from being the best of times.

Syria 'chemical attack': What we know,"Medical and rescue organisations say most of the victims were children and women Syrian opposition activists, rescue workers and medics say more than 40 people were killed on 7 April in a suspected chemical attack on Douma, which was the last rebel-held town in the Eastern Ghouta region. The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) says initial tests on samples from two sites detected ""various chlorinated organic chemicals"", along with explosive residues. However, no nerve agents were detected. The Syrian government denies ever using chemical weapons, and its ally Russia says it has evidence that the incident was staged with the help of the UK. In February, forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad launched an assault on the Eastern Ghouta that reportedly left more than 1,700 civilians dead. In March, troops split the region into three pockets - the largest of which was around Douma, home to between 80,000 and 150,000 people. Facing defeat, rebel groups in the other two pockets agreed to be evacuated to northern Syria. But the group controlling Douma, Jaysh al-Islam, continued to hold out. On 6 April, after negotiations with the government stalled, air strikes resumed. The bombardment continued for a second day, with dozens of people reportedly killed or injured by conventional munitions before the suspected chemical attack. Activists from the Violations Documentation Center (VDC), which records alleged violations of international law in Syria, reportedtwo separate incidents of bombs believed to contain toxic substances being dropped by the Syrian Air Force,external. The first occurred at approximately 16:00 (13:00 GMT) and saw the Saada bakery on Omar Ibn Al-Khattab street in north-western Douma targeted, the VDC said. Activists say Douma came under intense aerial bombardment on Saturday It cited a member of the Syria Civil Defence, whose rescue workers are widely known as the White Helmets, as saying he smelt chlorine in the air after the strike, but that he could not determine its source. The VDC said the second incident took place not far to the east, near Martyrs' Square, at approximately 19:30. At 19:45, more than 500 patients - most of them women and children - were brought to medical facilities with symptoms indicative of exposure to a chemical agent,external, according to the Syria Civil Defence and the Syrian American Medical Society (SAMS), which supports hospitals in rebel-held areas. This video can not be played Unverified video shows children being treated after the alleged gas attack The patients showed signs of ""respiratory distress, central cyanosis [blue skin or lips], excessive oral foaming, corneal burns, and the emission of chlorine-like odour"", a joint statement issued on Sunday said. One woman who died had convulsions and pinpoint pupils. Rescue workers searching homes in the affected area also found the bodies of people with oral foaming, cyanosis, and corneal burns, the statement added. The Union of Medical Care and Relief Organizations (UOSSM), which supports hospitals in rebel-held Syria, also saidit received reports of two incidents,external. Patients were hosed down with water to remove any chemicals on their skin People were treated for breathing difficulties and irritation of the eyes following the first, the UOSSM said. After the second, patients were brought to hospital smelling strongly of a chlorine-like substance and presenting symptoms that included cyanosis, foaming of the mouth, and cornea irritation, it added. A medical student working at a hospital told the BBC he had treated a man who died,external. ""His pupils were dilated and he had foam in his mouth. His heart was very slow. Then he coughed blood into his mouth as well,"" he said. Two videos circulated by the opposition activist group Douma Revolution showed what it said werethe bodies of children, women and men found in one block of flats,external, which is believed to be located south-west of Martyrs' Square. Some had foam coming out of their mouths and noses. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Activists also posted avideo which they said showed a yellow industrial gas cylinder on the balcony of the same block of flats,external. One end of the cylinder was lying in a crater-like opening in the reinforced concrete floor. A second gas cylinder was filmed on the bed of a top-floor flat,externalto the south-west, below a crater-like opening in the concrete roof. The World Health Organization said on 11 April that it had received reports from its local ""health cluster partners"" of43 deaths related to symptoms consistent with exposure to highly toxic chemicals"",external. The Syria Civil Defence and SAMS said rescue workers found 42 people dead in their homes. One person was declared dead on arrival at a hospital, and another six died while receiving treatment, they added. An earlier, now deleted tweet by the Syria Civil Defence put the number dead at more than 150. The UOSSM initially reported that 70 people were confirmed dead. On 9 April,it revised down the figure to at least 42,external. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group, said air strikes on 6 and 7 April killed almost 100 people. It said they included 21 who died as a result of suffocation, but that it was unable to identify the cause. The British investigative journalism website, Bellingcat, said it had counted at least 34 bodies,externalin the two videos circulated by Douma Revolution. Bellingcat also assessed that the block of flats near Martyrs' Square where the bodies were filmed wasvisited by Russian military personnel on 9 April,external. The Syria Civil Defence and SAMS said the day after the incident that they believed those who died suffocated as a result of exposure to toxic chemicals, most likely an organophosphate - a compound grouping associated with pesticides and nerve agents, such as Sarin. The UOSSM also concluded that the symptoms of the casualties were consistent with exposure to a nerve agent, possibly one mixed with chlorine. On 13 April, the US said itassessed ""with confidence that the Syrian regime used chemical weapons"",external. The conclusion was ""based on descriptions of the attack in multiple media sources, the reported symptoms experienced by victims, videos and images showing two assessed barrel bombs from the attack, and reliable information indicating co-ordination between Syrian military officials before the attack"". It added: ""A significant body of information points to the regime using chlorine in its bombardment of Douma, while some additional information points to the regime also using the nerve agent Sarin."" A fact-finding team from the OPCW has travelled to Damascus to investigate the allegations The OPCW, which oversees the Chemical Weapons Convention, dispatched experts from its Fact-Finding Mission (FFM) to Damascus five days after the attack. But they were unable to visit any of the sites of interest until 21 April because of an attack on a UN security team conducting a reconnaissance mission. The FFM team interviewed witnesses and collected environmental samples and data from three locations:the hospital where victims were allegedly treated for chemical exposure,external;the block of flats with the cylinder on the balcony,external(referred to as ""Location 2"");the flat with the cylinder on the bed,external(""Location 4""). The team also gathered or received samples and interviewed witnesses, including alleged casualties, in a neighbouring country. On 6 July, a preliminary report issued by the OPCW said ""no organophosphorus nerve agents or their degradation products were detected,external, either in the environmental samples or in plasma samples from the alleged casualties"".  However, it added, ""various chlorinated organic chemicals were found in samples from Locations 2 and 4, along with residues of explosive"". The OPCW said the FFM team was now working to establish the significance of the results. It is also assessing the association of the two gas cylinders with the incident, the relative damage to the cylinders and the roofs, and how the cylinders arrived at their respective locations. The chlorinated compounds included those used to treat drinking water, as a disinfectant, a wood preservative, or a flame retardant. However, the same compounds were detected at other sites in Syria where the OPCW has concluded that chlorine was likely used as a weapon, includingSaraqeb,externalandLatamina,external. President Assad has accused the US, UK and France of ""staging"" the incident in Douma,externalwith the help of the Syria Civil Defence, which receives funding from Western governments. ""It was a lie. After we liberated that area our information confirmed the attack did not take place,"" he told the Daily Mail on 9 June. ""The British government should prove with evidence that the attack happened, and then they should prove who is responsible. This did not happen."" Syrian government ground forces advanced towards Douma on Saturday Russian permanent representative to the UN Vassily Nebenzia told the Security Council on 9 April thatRussian military specialists had visited Douma and taken soil samples that showed no presence of nerve agents or substances containing chlorine,external. He also said no-one with symptoms of exposure to sarin or chlorine had been admitted to Douma's hospital, nor any bodies found. Four days later, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Russia had ""irrefutable evidence that this was yet another attack, staged with the participation of special services of one state that is striving to be at the forefront of the Russophobic campaign"". This video can not be played Russia's foreign minister says the only evidence of a chemical attack came from the media A British diplomat called the allegation ""bizarre"" and a ""blatant lie"". On 26 April, Russian and Syrian diplomats presented to a briefing at the OPCW's headquarters in The Hague more than a dozen people from Douma who said they had not seen any evidence of chemical weapons being used there. They included Hasan Diab,an 11-year-old boy who was seen being doused in water,externalin a video widely circulated online after the alleged attack. ""We heard cries on the street that we should go to the hospital. We got scared. We went to the hospital through the tunnel,""he told reporters,external. ""They started pouring water on me at the hospital. I don't know why."" Hasan Diab, 11, appeared at a briefing organised by Russian and Syrian diplomats in The Hague Western nations dismissed the event as ""nothing more than a crude propaganda exercise"",externaland an ""obscene masquerade"". The US said it had no information to suggest Jaysh al-Islam had ever used chemical weapons,external, and that it was unlikely that the opposition could have fabricated the number of reports that came from Douma on 7 April and ""deceived multiple media outlets while evading our detection"". United Nations Secretary General AntÃ³nio Guterres said he was outraged by the reports from Douma,externaland warned that ""any confirmed use of chemical weapons, by any party to the conflict and under any circumstances, is abhorrent and a clear violation of international law"". Hours before the OPCW Fact-Finding Mission team arrived in Damascus on 14 April, the US, UK and France carried out missile strikes on three sites they said were ""specifically associated with the Syrian regime's chemical weapons programme"". This video can not be played How the Western attacks on Syria's suspected chemical weapons sites unfolded The US military said warships and jets launched 105 missiles,externalthat hit a branch of the Scientific Studies and Research Centre (SSRC) in the capital's Barzeh district, the Him Shinshar chemical weapons storage facility west of the city of Homs, and a nearby chemical weapons bunker. US President Donald Trump said he wanted ""to establish a strong deterrent against the production, spread, and use of chemical weapons"",external. The Syrian foreign ministry denounced ""the barbaric aggression"". In August 2013, rockets containing Sarin were fired at several opposition-held suburbs in the Eastern and Western Ghouta, killing hundreds of people.UN experts confirmed that Sarin was used in the attack,external, but they were not asked to ascribe any blame. Western powers said only Syrian government forces could have carried out the attack. President Assad denied the allegation, but he did agree to sign the Chemical Weapons Convention and destroy Syria's declared chemical arsenal. Experts from a joint UN-OPCW mission also said they were confident that government forces used Sarin in an attack in April 2017 on the rebel-held Khan Sheikhoun,external, which reportedly killed more than 80 people. President Assad dismissed the attack as a fabrication, but the US carried a cruise missile strike on a Syrian airbase in retaliation. The UN-OPCW mission also found that government forces used chlorine as a weapon on at least three occasions during the civil war.

'Windrush generation' deportation threatThe Home Office is accused of harassing people from Commonwealth countries who have lived in the UK for decades.9h9 hours agoUK Politics,"This video can not be played ""My whole life sunk down to my feet"" - Windrush migrant Michael Braithwaite Thousands of people who arrived in the UK as children in the first wave of Commonwealth immigration face being threatened with deportation. They have lived and worked in the UK for decades but many are now being told they are here illegally. A new petition on the government's website calling on the Home Office to grant them an amnesty has attracted more than 23,000 signatures. The Home Office said it would handle applications to stay ""sensitively"". A slap in the face for the Windrush generation? The problem arises from the fact that under the 1971 Immigration Act, all Commonwealth citizens already living in the UK were given indefinite leave to remain - but the right to free movement between Commonwealth nations was ended from that date onwards. However, the Home Office did not keep a record of those granted leave to remain or issue any paperwork confirming it, meaning it is difficult for the individuals to now prove they are in the UK legally. The Migration Observatory at Oxford University estimates there are 500,000 people resident in the UK who were born in a Commonwealth country and arrived before 1971. ""This is a slap in the face for the Windrush generation,"" said Patrick Vernon, who started the petition, a reference to the Empire Windrush, which brought workers from the West Indies to Britain in 1948. People who had ""worked hard, paid their taxes, raised children and see Britain as their home"" were being ""threatened and harassed"" by the Home Office in what he described as ""an historic injustice"". It was particularly ironic, he added, because 2018 was the 70th anniversary of the Empire Windrush's arrival at Tilbury docks, in Essex. He said his aim was to gain the 100,000 signatures needed to trigger a debate in Parliament and force the government to stop deportations, establish an amnesty and pay compensation to those who had suffered ""loss and hurt"". Labour MP David Lammy, who is backing the campaign, tweeted: ""We invited people as citizens, Home Office treating them like criminals."" Allow Twitter content?

People born in Jamaica and other Caribbean countries are thought to be more affected than those from other Commonwealth nations, as they were more likely to arrive on their parent's passports without their own ID documents. Many have never applied for a passport in their own name or had their immigration status formalised, as they regarded themselves as British. TheGuardian newspaper has highlighted a number of cases,externalof such people being threatened with deportation. Earlier this year, the Labour peer Lord Faulkner raised the case of Paulette Wilson, a former cook at the House of Commons, who had come to Britain from Jamaica in 1968. One woman was sent to Yarl's Wood immigration removals centre ""(She) had never applied for a passport because she assumed she would not need one if she did not intend to travel abroad,"" he told the House of Lords. ""One day, she got a letter from the Home Office telling her to register each month at the Solihull immigration centre. ""While she was there on a visit, officials declared that she was an illegal immigrant, had her carted off to the appalling Yarl's Wood immigration removal complex and told her that she would be deported - presumably back to Jamaica, which she had not visited since she left as a child almost 50 years before,"" he added. She was saved from deportation by the intervention of her MP, Emma Reynolds, and the Refugee and Migrant Centre in Wolverhampton. She has now been given leave to remain, said Lord Faulkner, ""although she has lost benefits for the past two years, as well as her flat, and has to rely on financial support from her daughter"". He said there were ""many others"" like Mrs Wilson - and he blamed measures introduced by then Home Secretary Theresa May in 2013 to make the UK a ""hostile environment"" for illegal immigrants, restricting access to jobs, driving licences, benefits, health care and accommodation. He said this had ""clearly led to overzealous interventions by officials"". A Home Office spokesperson said: ""We value the contribution made by former Commonwealth citizens who have made a life in the UK. ""We want to assure individuals who have resided in the UK for an extended period but feel they may not have the correct documentation confirming their status that there are existing solutions available. ""They should take legal advice and submit the appropriate application with correct evidence so we can progress the case. ""We have no intention of making people leave who have the right to remain here,"" the Home Office added. The Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants said there were cases of Australian, Canadian and South African, Indian and Pakistan-born citizens facing the same problem. But it was ""not as likely you will be asked to demonstrate your immigration status"" by landlords or officials if you were ""white and of European origin"", JCWI chief executive, Satbir Singh, told BBC News. The JCWI is calling for Commonwealth citizens who arrived before 1971 to be given the same status as EU citizens living in the UK, who will face a much lower burden of proof of residence than the Commonwealth citizens after Brexit. The final details have yet to be confirmed but EU citizens may be able to produce things like school registration paperwork or library cards to prove residence, something that would not be accepted from Commonwealth citizens, the campaign group said.

Facebook chief's data was harvestedThe chief executive also tells Congress that Facebook may take action against Cambridge University.7h7 hours agoTechnology,"In his opening remarks Mr Zuckerberg said that Facebook was an ""idealistic"" company Facebook's chief executive has revealed that his data was among that harvested in a privacy scandal. Mark Zuckerberg made the disclosure during his second day of being questioned in Washington. In a related development, the political consultancy at the heart of the affair has announced its acting chief executive is stepping down. He also revealed that his firm was exploring whether to take action against the University of Cambridge. The institution is where the researcher Aleksandr Kogan, who had collected and sold personal data to Cambridge Analytica, was based. ""What we found now is that there's a whole programme associated with Cambridge University where... there were a number of other researchers building similar apps,"" Mr Zuckerberg said. ""So, we do need to understand whether there was something bad going on at Cambridge University overall that will require a stronger reaction from us."" The university has reacted by saying it would be ""surprised"" if Mr Zuckerberg was only now aware of the work. ""Our researchers have been publishing such research since 2013 in major peer-reviewed scientific journals, and these studies have been reported widely in international media,"" it added. ""These have included one study in 2015 led by Dr Aleksandr Spectre (Kogan) and co-authored by two Facebook employees. ""We have found no evidence that University researchers are improperly gathering personal data."" Zuckerberg: Facebook is in 'arms race' with Russia Facebook and Google 'must be paid for' Facebook: Data contained private messages Mr Zuckerberghad earlier apologised,externalfor having failed to check in 2015 that Cambridge Analytica had deleted information gathered about millions of Facebook users. Instead Facebook let the political consultancy self-certify that it had destroyed the records, which it said had been acquired in violation of the social network's rules. Allow YouTube content?

Mr Zuckerberg's four hour appearance before the House Committee on Energy and Commerce followed a five hour session in front of two Senate committees yesterday. During a testy early exchange, he declined to give a commitment to change all users' default privacy settings to collect the minimum amount of personal information. ""This is a complex issue,"" Mr Zuckerberg said. ""That's disappointing to me,"" responded Democratic congressman Frank Pallone. Elsewhere in the hearing, Mr Zuckerberg acknowledged that he believed it was ""inevitable"" that the internet would need new regulations. ""My position is not that there should be no regulation, but I also think you have to be careful about what regulation you put in place,"" he said. The Facebook chief also faced fresh accusations from Republican congressman Steve Scalise that the News Feed's algorithm was discriminating against conservative news and content in favour of liberal posts. ""There is absolutely no directive in any of the changes that we make to have a bias,"" responded Mr Zuckerberg. ""To the contrary our goal is to be a platform for all ideas."" Another Republican pulled a surprise by displaying photos of illegal adverts for opioid drugs that he said had been live on Facebook yesterday. ""Facebook is actually enabling an illegal activity and in so doing you are hurting people,"" said congressman David McKinley. This screenshot showing adverts for Oxycodone and Buprenorphine was shown to the Facebook chief ""There are a number of areas of content that we need to do a better job of policing,"" Mr Zuckerberg replied, adding that he believed artificial intelligence tools would make this possible in the future. However, several of the politicians urged Facebook to be more proactive about the matter. Mr Zuckerberg also faced questions about the illegal trade of ivory in closed Facebook groups. In another combative exchange, the business leader was questioned about the data his firm collected on people who had never signed up to his service. Mr Zuckerberg said this was done for security purposes. But he professed not to be familiar with the term ""shadow profiles""despite it having been used widely,externalby the media during a past Facebook data privacy controversy. And he was unable to say how many types of data were being gathered about non-members. ""You said everyone controls their data,"" said Democratic congressman Ben Ray Lujan. Congressman Lujan raised the issue of shadow profiles ""But you are collecting data on people that are not even Facebook users, that have never signed a consent or privacy agreement. ""When you go to Facebook's 'I don't have a Facebook account page and would like to request all my personal data stored by Facebook', it takes you to a form that says go to your Facebook page and then on your account settings you can download your data.

Officer who dragged man from plane suesThe ex-officer who was fired after the United Airlines incident alleges he was not properly trained.1h33 minutes agoUS & Canada,"A former Chicago aviation security officer who was fired after dragging a man off a flight last year has filed a lawsuit against the airline and city. James Long is suing Chicago's Department of Aviation (CDA), its commissioner and the city, alleging he was not trained on how to use force. He was sacked after removing David Dao from the plane last April to make room for United Airlines employees. Video footage of the incident sparked international outcry on social media. The ordeal led to demonstrations at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport and turned into a public relations disaster for United Airlines. The 69-year-old Vietnamese-American physician was forcibly removed after refusing to give up his seat to airline employees on a flight from Chicago to Louisville, Kentucky on 9 April last year. United Airlines incident: What went wrong? United Airlines' public relations disaster Dr Dao, who lost two front teeth, suffered a broken nose and a ""significant"" concussion, later reached a settlement with United Airlines for an undisclosed amount of money. The airline also apologised for how he was treated. His lawyer has said that Dr Dao found the experience ""more horrifying and harrowing than what he experienced when leaving Vietnam"". Civil rights leader Reverend Jesse Jackson led a protest at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport over the incident The airline also changed its policy on giving staff last-minute seats on full flights and said future crew members would be allocated seats at least an hour before departure. Mr Long and three other security officers were placed on administration leave after the incident. He was fired by the city in August, the lawsuit claims. According to the complaint, filed in Cook County Circuit Court on Tuesday, Mr Long claims the airline should have been aware that calling security would result in ""the use of physical force"". United blamed the incident on an overbooked flight, but later changed its policy on how to handle such cases He also alleges that although he completed five months of a police recruit training programme, the department did not provide training on the ""level of force continuum"", according to the Chicago Tribune newspaper. ""But for the CDA's negligence and failure to train [Long] how to respond to an escalating situation with an Airline Passenger, [he] would not have acted in the manner he did, which resulted in his termination,"" the complaint says, according to newspaper. This video can not be played Crystal Dao Pepper: ""We were horrified, shocked and sickened to learn what had happened"" The lawsuit also blames CDA Commissioner Ginger Evans, whom Mr Long claims defamed him in statements to US media. The former aviation officer is seeking damages over his sacking, which includes back pay and payment to his retirement plan. Bill McCaffrey, a spokesman for Chicago's department of law, told Reuters news agency he had not received the lawsuit and declined to comment further.
