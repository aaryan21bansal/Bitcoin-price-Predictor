India chase 351 to beat England in Pune,"Virat Kohli averages 95.66 in ODIs since the beginning of 2016 First one-day international, Pune England 350-7 (50 overs):Stokes 62 (40), Root 78 (95), Roy 73 (61) India 356-7 (48.1 overs):Kohli 122 (105), Jadhav 120 (76) India won by three wickets Scorecard A Virat Kohli masterclass helped India complete the highest successful chase in a one-day international against England and seal a three-wicket win. Chasing 351, India were reduced to 63-4 in Pune before Kohli, who made 122, and Kedar Jadhav (120) shared 200. India completed the joint-fourth best run chase of all time in 48.1 overs. Ben Stokes earlier struck a 40-ball 62 as England took 105 from their final eight overs, but they still went behind in the three-match series. It is a demoralising result, coming after a4-0 defeat in the Test series,and extends England's dismal record in India to only three wins in 24 ODIs. Though England racked up their highest score against India, they could arguably have had even more - Jason Roy and Joe Root failed to make really big scores after good starts - and were taught a lesson by chasing specialist Kohli, who somehow overshadowed Jadhav's 65-ball century. Kohli is peerless in the history of ODIs when it comes to run chases. His 17th second-innings ton matches the record of Sachin Tendulkar, in 136 fewer knocks, while his average when India successfully pursue a score is 90.90. This, though, in his first match sincebeing appointed one-day captain,was perhaps his greatest effort, guiding India to their joint-second-highest chase. When England's pace bowlers ran through the top order, he looked to be playing a lone hand, with effortless drives on both sides of the wicket and breathless running. Later, in the company of Jadhav, he found ways to hit some extraordinary sixes over the leg side, the fourth of his five maximums overall bringing up his 27th ODI century. The biggest surprise was that he did not complete the job, miscuing a Stokes slower ball to David Willey at cover and sending a raucous and partisan Pune silent. Kedar Jadhav made his second century in his 13th ODI For all of Kohli's brilliance, this game would not have been won without the efforts of Jadhav, a 31-year-old playing only his 13th ODI, on his home ground. The right-hander's counter-attacking reversed the momentum and he actually contributed 102 of the 200 runs he shared with the skipper for the fifth wicket. They rendered the England attack impotent, only Chris Woakes went for an economy rate of under 6.7 an over, with Adil Rashid and Stokes particularly wayward. Favouring the leg side, Jadav's hundred was the sixth fastest by an India batsman in ODIs, but after Kohli fell he struggled with cramp and pulled Jake Ball to deep square leg. However, a nerveless Hardik Pandya made an unbeaten 40 and Ravichandran Ashwin's six off Moeen Ali sealed only the second chase in excess of 350 to be completed inside 49 overs. Simon Hughes on Test Match Special ""We have just seen the definition of intimidatory batting, the way the batters from both sides demolished the attacks. ""350 should be enough but I've always worried about England's bowling in one-day cricket unless the ball does something. Adil Rashid lacks confidence under pressure. Chris Woakes bowled a superb opening spell but it was almost a licence to print runs on this pitch. ""England have got to set their targets higher - they've got to get to 370, 380 to feel confident of winning."" India pulled off the joint-fourth-highest run chase of all time, their joint second best and the largest by anyone against England. This is the second-fastest successful chase of a total of more than 350 in ODI history. Since the beginning of 2016, Virat Kohli has played 11 ODI innings, scoring four hundreds and four half-centuries, averaging 95.66 with a strike-rate of 102.01. Ben Stokes' 33-ball fifty beat the 35-ball efforts of Andrew Flintoff and Owais Shah to become the fastest by an England batsman against India. The 105 added by England in the final eight overs of the innings is their second highest in an away ODI. Joe Root has passed 50 in six of his past eight ODI innings and has made nine 50-plus scores in his past 15 innings. Ben Stokes struck the fastest half-century by an England batsman in an ODI against India On a brilliant batting surface surrounded by short boundaries, England should have been ahead of their 244-5 when Root fell in the 42nd over. Roy in particular wasted the opportunity of a big score when he ran past the left-arm spin of the excellent Ravindra Jadeja to be stumped for 73, while Root holed out for a relatively pedestrian 95-ball 78 as he looked to accelerate. It was left to Stokes to propel England with some wonderful hitting, helped by some woeful India death bowling that was littered with full-tosses. He struck five sixes - two over long-on, two over long-off and one extraordinary ramp over third man off a pacey Umesh Yadav beamer. The left-hander's 33-ball half-century was the fastest by an England batsman against India and, overall, he took 50 runs from the last 23 balls he faced. Even after the late onslaught, and the four early wickets, India showed that it still was not enough. India captain Virat Kohli:""This one is going to take a while to sink in, conceding 350 runs and being 63-4. ""What a special innings from Jadhav, and Hardik finishing really well at the end with Ashwin. That's a very special win for us. ""The moment he came to the crease, Jadhav started hitting the ball really well and I said, 'if we get to 150 here, they will press the panic button - watch'. ""It was a very, very special partnership that I'll remember for a long time."" England captain Eoin Morgan:""We had the runs on the board. We wanted to bowl first to see what a good score was. You post 350 and you think you're in the game, especially after taking four early wickets, but credit to Virat and Kedar - they didn't give us a chance. ""We didn't play at out best today, we thought we were in the game for most of it so all is not lost. ""The batters did well but we had a tricky period between 35 and 40 overs after we lost Buttler's wicket, but Stokes did well to come in and get us in to the game. Ideally we would have upped the momentum a little earlier.""

Murray & Konta lead GB Aussie Open hopes,"Novak Djokovic has won the Australian Open a record six times with his latest win against Andy Murray in 2016 Australian Open 2017 Venue:Melbourne Park, MelbourneDates:16-29 Jan Coverage:Live commentary on BBC Radio 5 live sports extra plus TV highlights on BBC Two from 21 Jan; live text on selected matches on BBC Sport website. Andy Murray says it feels no different to enter the Australian Open as the world number one. A few players do now address him as 'Sir' - but that, he says, is with tongue firmly in cheek. The challenge, though, remains as tough as ever. Murray has lost five finals in Melbourne in the past seven years, while Novak Djokovic - now the number two - has won the title six times in all. Murray struck an important blow by beating his lifelong rival at the World Tour Finals to end 2016 at the top of the rankings; but earlier this month, the Serb hit back to win the Qatar Open in Doha and halt Murray's winning streak at 28 in a match of nearly three hours. Murray is expecting another gruelling clash should they meet in the final here in Melbourne on 29 January. ""The way that we both play, we can't just hit through each other in one shot,"" the Scot said. Monday's Australian Open order of play How to follow the Australian Open on the BBC ""It takes a few big shots to win points, so if we're playing well they tend to be long, physical matches. ""Doha was good because I was able to see how well I recovered from it: first week of the year, you can be a bit stiff and sore. I pulled up pretty well, so it was positive."" Much may depend on the energy they expend in the early rounds of the competition. The draw does not appear to leave either at a significant advantage, so at 29, Murray has as good a chance as ever of winning his first Australian Open title. This video can not be played In-form Konta 'happy' before Australian Open In the women's draw, there is a real opportunity for a top-20 player without a Grand Slam title to break their duck at this Australian Open. Britain's Johanna Konta is as well equipped as any. The 25-year-old, who will be ninth in Monday's world rankings, is on a high after winningher second WTA title in Sydney on Friday, but it does mean she has had little time to rest before a challenging first week. Her draw appears brutal (although she will not thank you for telling her, as she prefers not to look beyond the first match). If Konta can beat 2013 Wimbledon semi-finalist Kirsten Flipkens of Belgium in the first round, she might then have to face the aggressive talent of Japanese 19-year-old Naomi Osaka in the second round and former world number one Caroline Wozniacki in the third. Konta's decision at the end of last season to part company with coach Esteban Carril, so soon after the sudden death of her mental coach Juan Coto, was a big surprise. The WTA's most improved player of 2016 was 150 in the world when she started working with Carril, but my understanding is the two were unable to agree financial terms for the year ahead. Australian Open draws Serena not thinking about breaking Graf's grand slam record It is a sign of Konta's standing in the game that she has been able to attract one of the best in the business as a replacement. Wim Fissette is just 36 - but already has a sparkling CV. The Belgian was coach to Kim Clijsters when she won three of her Grand Slam titles, and has also coached Sabine Lisicki and Simona Halep to Grand Slam finals. A flourishing partnership with Victoria Azarenka only ended when the Belarusian announced she was taking a break from the sport because she was pregnant. Konta and Fissette agreed to work together after a trial week at Patrick Mouratoglou's Academy in Nice in the week before Christmas. Mouratoglou, the coach of Serena Williams, rates Fissette highly. ""He's worked with some of the best players on tour so he has the experience and I think he's still fresh,"" he said. ""He's young, so he still has the motivation which is something very important because when you get older, a lot of guys don't want to travel that much. He's one of the best on tour, so I think it's a good pick."" Dan Evans reached his first ATP final this month, losing to Luxembourg's Gilles Muller in the final of the Sydney International on Saturday At last year's US Open, Dan Evans made the third round, and fellow Briton Kyle Edmund the fourth. Edmund, 22, is now a top-50 player, and Evans just a single place adrift after he appeared inhis maiden ATP final in Sydneyon Saturday. Evans' creative talents have long been on show, but his consistency is now far greater and even in the defeat by Luxembourg's Gilles Muller the 5ft 9in player showed his serve can still pack a punch. All of the 26-year-old's matches bar the final in Sydney went to three sets, so sustaining his form in the opening week in Melbourne will be tough - especially with a Monday start. Evans, who faces Argentina's Facundo Bagnis in the first round, says it is positive that the matches are coming thick and fast and he was grateful for the private jet laid on by Tennis Australia for the journey to Melbourne on Saturday night. Kyle Edmund lost in the first round in Melbourne last year Edmund, meanwhile, has developed the useful knack of halving his world ranking on an annual basis. Every year, the challenge gets tougher, but he now stands at 46 in the world and in Brisbane earlier this month featured in his fifth ATP quarter-final since the start of last year. His forehand is one of the most powerful in the world, his net game much improved, and the physical problems which have undermined him in five-set matches hopefully now a thing of the past. Cramp proved his undoing in the first round of last year's Australian Open, and Edmund will once again have to deal with temperatures in the mid-30s Celsius for his first-round match against Colombia's Santiago Giraldo on Tuesday. It was not a year to remember in 2016 forAljaz Bedene, who nearly decided to walk away from the sport last summer. His love of tennis deserted him - something he relates directly to the International Tennis Federation's rejection of his appeal against his ineligibility to play Davis Cup for Great Britain. ""I honestly didn't want to play tennis, I didn't want to think about tennis,"" Slovenian-born Bedene, 27, said. With his love of the game seemingly restored, Bedene faces Victor Estrella Burgos in the opening round. There is no finer example of the perils of retiring too young than the man from the Dominican Republic, who cracked the top 100 for the first time at the age of 33. Heather Watson faces 2011 US Open champion and home favourite Sam Stosur in her first-round match The other two British players in the draw face seeded Australians in the opening round. Heather Watson, 24, has fallen to 75 in the world after a promising start to last year, but will be in the Margaret Court Arena for her match against Sam Stosur. Australia's highest women's seed is the 2011 US Open champion, but has a poor record in Melbourne where in 15 years she has reached the fourth round just twice. Naomi Broady, 26, takes on an Australian who made a name for herself here last year. Daria Gavrilova beat two-time Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova en route to the fourth round in the first Australian Open she had contested since switching nationalities from Russia. Broady, at 95 in the world, is competing in her first main draw in Melbourne and can never be discounted given the potency of her serve. The one high profile name missing from the main draw is Laura Robson, whose defeat in the first round of qualifying was her seventh in a row. In truth, it was a hugely erratic performance undermined by a chronic loss of confidence. Robson is still only 22, though, and working seriously for the first time with a sports psychologist. A run of Challenger tournaments in France and Germany will provide a better clue to what 2017 holds in store - and whether she will be part of the debate once the French Open rolls around in four months' time.

'I'll make Brexit great',"President-elect Donald Trump is making the headlines on several of Monday's front pages. His pledge to offer Britain a ""quick"" trade deal dominates the front page ofthe Times,external. The president-elect tells the paper that Brexit will be a ""great thing"" and predicts that other countries will follow Britain's lead in leaving the EU, which he says has been ""deeply damaged"" by the migration crisis. Mr Trump's interview is also the lead story forthe Daily Telegraph,externalwhich sees his remarks as a ""boost"" for Theresa May, ahead of her speech on Tuesday about the government's plans for Brexit. The Guardian,externalsays Mr Trump has been warned that his ""careless"" use of Twitter could cause a security risk. The outgoing director of the CIA, John Brennan, is quoted as saying the president-elect has a ""tremendous responsibility"" to protect the US and its interests. The Daily Telegraph says Mr Brennan has cautioned Mr Trump against forging closer ties with Russia, arguing against the lifting of sanctions. But the Daily Mail suggests the next US leader is planning a summit with Vladimir Putin ""weeks"" after becoming president, ""as he seeks to improve relations with the Kremlin"". Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt is set to pocket Â£15m from the sale of an education website, according tothe Daily Mirror,external. The paper's headline describes the deal as a ""payday sickener"" as the NHS is ""cut to the bone"" while its editorial accuses Mr Hunt of being ""born with a silver thermometer in his mouth"" and calls on him to ""study his conscience"". The Times agrees that the windfall is ""politically embarrassing"" following the government's disputes with junior doctors and GPs.  The Daily Telegraph claims the deal will make Mr Hunt ""the richest member of the cabinet"". Jeremy Hunt set to receive a Â£15m windfall is ""politcally embarrassing"" says the Times Meanwhilethe Daily Mail,external's lead story highlights what it calls ""the scale of abuse of the crumbling NHS by health tourists"". It claims a hospital in Luton is attempting to recoup Â£350,000 from a Nigerian woman, who is said to have flown to Britain to give birth to twins. The cancer specialist, Professor Meirion Thomas, tells the paper that similar, ""staggering"" debts should be investigated by NHS fraud officers, as ""patients don't arrive at specialist hospitals with serious illnesses by chance"". The Sun says the half-brother of Prince Harry's American girlfriend, Meghan Markle, has apologised after he was arrested for alleged gun offences in the US.  Thomas Markle Jr blamed the incident on a drunken argument, prompting the headline ""Soz Sis! I was so sozzled"". The Daily Mail says other members of the family have insisted the arrest will not cause problems for Ms Markle's relationship with Prince Harry, but the Daily Express  claims there is ""some concern"" in royal circles.

Beach leg break man uses Morse code,"Army reservist Tim Robinson used a miniature torch to signal to his wife An army reservist who broke his leg on a Dorset beach used Morse code with his torch to signal for help. Sgt Tim Robinson was walking under Golden Cap, east of Lyme Regis, when he slipped on some seaweed. As it was getting dark, Sgt Robinson, who was visiting from Derbyshire, used his torch to signal ""SOS"" in Morse code to his wife, more than a mile away. The 54-year-old reservist, who has done three tours in the Middle East was taken to Dorset County Hospital. Sgt Robinson was walking on his own on the Jurassic Coast when he slipped, fell and broke his leg on Saturday 7 January. He was two miles away from the nearest town and did not have a mobile phone on him. He said: ""I stepped on some seaweed and slipped, then my leg snapped. ""I fell backwards and I heard it go with a large crack, my foot was at a 45 degree angle. Sgt Robinson was walking near Seatown in Dorset when he broke his leg ""[There's a] moment of disbelief and denial, and then you pull yourself together and think, 'what have I got with me and what am I going to do?'."" He staggered and crawled for about two hours before he took out his miniature torch and began signalling towards his hotel, where he hoped his wife would be looking for him. The reservist regimentally signalled the SOS Morse code and then swung the torch over his head - a technique army officers use to signal helicopters. He then crawled 50 yards. He repeated the process three times before his wife found him by following the signals. She then called the emergency services. He was taken by lifeboat to Lyme Regis before being transferred by ambulance to hospital.

Prince pens Ladybird book on climate change,"The cover of the book was based on an image of flooding in Uckfield, East Sussex Prince Charles has co-authored a Ladybird book on the challenges and possible solutions to climate change. It is part of a series for adults written in the style of the well-known children's books that aims to clearly explain complicated subjects. The 52-page guide has been co-authored by former Friends of the Earth director Tony Juniper and climate scientist Emily Shuckburgh. Mr Juniper said he hoped the book would ""stand the test of time"". Ladybird produced a series of books for children in the 1960s and 1970s and has recently found renewed success with a range of humorous books for adults. Titles include the Ladybird Book of the Mid-Life Crisis and the Ladybird Book of the Hangover. The latest series involves experts explaining complex subjects in simple form. The prince previously co-authored a book with Mr Juniper and Ian Skelly called Harmony: A New Way of Looking at Our World. He also wrote a children's book entitled The Old Man of Lochnagar. The full cover of the climate change book, which goes on sale later in January Mr Juniper told theMail on Sunday,external: ""His royal highness, Emily and I had to work very hard to make sure that each word did its job, while at the same time working with the pictures to deliver the points we needed to make. ""I hope we've managed to paint a vivid picture, and, like those iconic titles from the 60s and 70s, created a title that will stand the test of time."" A publishing director for Penguin, which produces Ladybird books, revealed Clarence House had put the latest idea to the publisher. Rowland White told theSunday Times,external: ""It was a coincidence where we were thinking about a new series for adults after the huge success of the spoof books, but this time wanted some factual books by experts on science, history and arts subjects."" Penguin Books said the title, which will be released on 26 January, had been read and reviewed by figures within the environmental community. The other books in the series are Quantum Mechanics by Jim Al-Khalili, and Evolution by Steve Jones. Asked how the book might be received in the academic community, Dr Phillip Williamson, an associate fellow at the University of East Anglia's School of Environmental Sciences, said: ""There's the obvious danger that this won't be taken seriously. ""But if the style is right, and the information is correct and understandable, the new Ladybird book with royal authorship could be just what is needed to get the message across that everyone needs to take action on climate change.""

Oxford rejection letter turned into art,"Claudia Vulliamy had applied to Wadham College at Oxford University to study Classics; upon receiving her rejection letter she turned it into a piece of art A piece of abstract art made from a student's rejection letter from Oxford University has gone viral on Twitter. Claudia Vulliamy, from London, applied to study classics in September at Wadham College. But when the 18-year-old received her rejection letter, she ""thought it would be funny"" to use it to create a piece of artwork. A picture of the piecepublished on Twitter has been retweeted,external48,000 times. Her mother Louisa Saunders said: ""Between that time [she told me she had been rejected] and when I got back from work, she had made this artwork. ""I thought it was very funny and very spirited, and obviously I was glad she wasn't feeling to sad about it."" The picture has been liked on Twitter 153,000 times and has sparked a lot of reactions from students who were rejected from Oxbridge. Miss Vulliamy said there wasn't a message behind the artwork initially. She added: ""I just thought I had this letter, it's not often that you get a letter dedicated to you from Oxford. ""It's very meaningful, so I thought it would be funny if I made it into something."" Louisa Saunders, left, said she was amazed by the response to her daughter's artwork on social media Ms Saunders said some people on social media were comparing the painting to works by Piet Mondrian. The student, who has been accepted to Durham University, said: ""In retrospect I quite like how it is interpreted as Oxbridge doesn't determine everything, I like that it's cheered people up.

SportMurray & Konta lead GB Aussie Open hopesRussell FullerBBC tennis correspondent15 January 2017 (11:00:20),"Novak Djokovic has won the Australian Open a record six times with his latest win against Andy Murray in 2016 Australian Open 2017 Venue:Melbourne Park, MelbourneDates:16-29 Jan Coverage:Live commentary on BBC Radio 5 live sports extra plus TV highlights on BBC Two from 21 Jan; live text on selected matches on BBC Sport website. Andy Murray says it feels no different to enter the Australian Open as the world number one. A few players do now address him as 'Sir' - but that, he says, is with tongue firmly in cheek. The challenge, though, remains as tough as ever. Murray has lost five finals in Melbourne in the past seven years, while Novak Djokovic - now the number two - has won the title six times in all. Murray struck an important blow by beating his lifelong rival at the World Tour Finals to end 2016 at the top of the rankings; but earlier this month, the Serb hit back to win the Qatar Open in Doha and halt Murray's winning streak at 28 in a match of nearly three hours. Murray is expecting another gruelling clash should they meet in the final here in Melbourne on 29 January. ""The way that we both play, we can't just hit through each other in one shot,"" the Scot said. Monday's Australian Open order of play How to follow the Australian Open on the BBC ""It takes a few big shots to win points, so if we're playing well they tend to be long, physical matches. ""Doha was good because I was able to see how well I recovered from it: first week of the year, you can be a bit stiff and sore. I pulled up pretty well, so it was positive."" Much may depend on the energy they expend in the early rounds of the competition. The draw does not appear to leave either at a significant advantage, so at 29, Murray has as good a chance as ever of winning his first Australian Open title. This video can not be played In-form Konta 'happy' before Australian Open In the women's draw, there is a real opportunity for a top-20 player without a Grand Slam title to break their duck at this Australian Open. Britain's Johanna Konta is as well equipped as any. The 25-year-old, who will be ninth in Monday's world rankings, is on a high after winningher second WTA title in Sydney on Friday, but it does mean she has had little time to rest before a challenging first week. Her draw appears brutal (although she will not thank you for telling her, as she prefers not to look beyond the first match). If Konta can beat 2013 Wimbledon semi-finalist Kirsten Flipkens of Belgium in the first round, she might then have to face the aggressive talent of Japanese 19-year-old Naomi Osaka in the second round and former world number one Caroline Wozniacki in the third. Konta's decision at the end of last season to part company with coach Esteban Carril, so soon after the sudden death of her mental coach Juan Coto, was a big surprise. The WTA's most improved player of 2016 was 150 in the world when she started working with Carril, but my understanding is the two were unable to agree financial terms for the year ahead. Australian Open draws Serena not thinking about breaking Graf's grand slam record It is a sign of Konta's standing in the game that she has been able to attract one of the best in the business as a replacement. Wim Fissette is just 36 - but already has a sparkling CV. The Belgian was coach to Kim Clijsters when she won three of her Grand Slam titles, and has also coached Sabine Lisicki and Simona Halep to Grand Slam finals. A flourishing partnership with Victoria Azarenka only ended when the Belarusian announced she was taking a break from the sport because she was pregnant. Konta and Fissette agreed to work together after a trial week at Patrick Mouratoglou's Academy in Nice in the week before Christmas. Mouratoglou, the coach of Serena Williams, rates Fissette highly. ""He's worked with some of the best players on tour so he has the experience and I think he's still fresh,"" he said. ""He's young, so he still has the motivation which is something very important because when you get older, a lot of guys don't want to travel that much. He's one of the best on tour, so I think it's a good pick."" Dan Evans reached his first ATP final this month, losing to Luxembourg's Gilles Muller in the final of the Sydney International on Saturday At last year's US Open, Dan Evans made the third round, and fellow Briton Kyle Edmund the fourth. Edmund, 22, is now a top-50 player, and Evans just a single place adrift after he appeared inhis maiden ATP final in Sydneyon Saturday. Evans' creative talents have long been on show, but his consistency is now far greater and even in the defeat by Luxembourg's Gilles Muller the 5ft 9in player showed his serve can still pack a punch. All of the 26-year-old's matches bar the final in Sydney went to three sets, so sustaining his form in the opening week in Melbourne will be tough - especially with a Monday start. Evans, who faces Argentina's Facundo Bagnis in the first round, says it is positive that the matches are coming thick and fast and he was grateful for the private jet laid on by Tennis Australia for the journey to Melbourne on Saturday night. Kyle Edmund lost in the first round in Melbourne last year Edmund, meanwhile, has developed the useful knack of halving his world ranking on an annual basis. Every year, the challenge gets tougher, but he now stands at 46 in the world and in Brisbane earlier this month featured in his fifth ATP quarter-final since the start of last year. His forehand is one of the most powerful in the world, his net game much improved, and the physical problems which have undermined him in five-set matches hopefully now a thing of the past. Cramp proved his undoing in the first round of last year's Australian Open, and Edmund will once again have to deal with temperatures in the mid-30s Celsius for his first-round match against Colombia's Santiago Giraldo on Tuesday. It was not a year to remember in 2016 forAljaz Bedene, who nearly decided to walk away from the sport last summer. His love of tennis deserted him - something he relates directly to the International Tennis Federation's rejection of his appeal against his ineligibility to play Davis Cup for Great Britain. ""I honestly didn't want to play tennis, I didn't want to think about tennis,"" Slovenian-born Bedene, 27, said. With his love of the game seemingly restored, Bedene faces Victor Estrella Burgos in the opening round. There is no finer example of the perils of retiring too young than the man from the Dominican Republic, who cracked the top 100 for the first time at the age of 33. Heather Watson faces 2011 US Open champion and home favourite Sam Stosur in her first-round match The other two British players in the draw face seeded Australians in the opening round. Heather Watson, 24, has fallen to 75 in the world after a promising start to last year, but will be in the Margaret Court Arena for her match against Sam Stosur. Australia's highest women's seed is the 2011 US Open champion, but has a poor record in Melbourne where in 15 years she has reached the fourth round just twice. Naomi Broady, 26, takes on an Australian who made a name for herself here last year. Daria Gavrilova beat two-time Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova en route to the fourth round in the first Australian Open she had contested since switching nationalities from Russia. Broady, at 95 in the world, is competing in her first main draw in Melbourne and can never be discounted given the potency of her serve. The one high profile name missing from the main draw is Laura Robson, whose defeat in the first round of qualifying was her seventh in a row. In truth, it was a hugely erratic performance undermined by a chronic loss of confidence. Robson is still only 22, though, and working seriously for the first time with a sports psychologist. A run of Challenger tournaments in France and Germany will provide a better clue to what 2017 holds in store - and whether she will be part of the debate once the French Open rolls around in four months' time.

'May's Brexit battle plan',"Theresa May's Brexit plan ""could see the UK quit the EU single market"", according to many of Sunday's front pages. ""May's big gamble on a clean Brexit,"" is the main headline in theSunday Telegraph,external, which reports the content of the prime minister's much-anticipated speech this week is being ""closely guarded"" by Number 10. But citing ""numerous government sources"", the paper says the prime minister is expected to indicate she is prepared to take Britain out of the single market and the customs union. ""She's gone for the full works,"" a source tells the Sunday Telegraph. ""People will know that when she said 'Brexit means Brexit', she really meant it."" TheSunday Times,externalbelieves Mrs May will try to reassure voters who backed the Remain side, by suggesting that she could strike a transitional deal on Brexit, avoiding ""a cliff-edge"" for British business. TheSunday People,externalhighlights what it says will be an appeal to everyone to unite behind Mrs May's vision for leaving the EU. ""The victors in the EU referendum have a responsibility to act magnanimously,"" the paper quotes pre-released extracts from the speech as saying. ""The losers have a responsibility to respect the result."" The NHS winter crisis features in some of Sunday's newspapers The winter crisis in the NHS receives further coverage with theObserver,externalreporting that ""a large number of hospitals across the UK"" have been cancelling some cancer operations since the start of this year. TheMail on Sunday,externalleads with the results of a Survation poll, which found that more than three-quarters of 12,000 people surveyed believed money from the foreign aid budget should be diverted to the NHS. The Sunday Times leads with a suggestion that Donald Trump is planning to hold asummit with Vladimir Putin,external, within weeks of becoming US President. It says he hopes to emulate Ronald Reagan's Cold-War deal-making with Mikhail Gorbachev. On its front page, the Observer carries a claim by the former Foreign Office minister, Chris Bryant, who says he's ""certain"" Russia istargeting senior British politicians,external, to try to find out potentially compromising details about their private lives. On the letters page of the Sunday Telegraph, 50 Conservative MPsurge the government to bring in tougher strike laws,external. They want walkouts on ""critical public infrastructure"", such as train and bus services, to be banned unless a judge decides the action is proportionate. TheSun on Sunday,externalreports that the rail company Southern is preparing to recruit 200 part-time drivers to keep trains running during strikes. First it was ""trousergate"", in which Theresa May's ""high-end"" wardrobe choices caused a storm, now she is to grace the pages of the world's most influential fashion bible. This is according to the Mail on Sunday, which reveals that the prime minister hasposed for the renowned photographer, Annie Leibovitz,external, in a fashion shoot for American Vogue. TheSun on Sunday,externalsays the aim is to make the Theresa May appear ""more personable"" to British voters. But the Mail on Sunday takes a different view and says it is part of a Downing Street strategy to cosy up to the new administration in the White House, after being ""wrong-footed"" by the presidential election result. ""Theresa knows she needs to raise her profile in the US,"" a source tells the paper. ""The Vogue shoot will form a central part of Operation Trump.""

Toxic air,"China's capital is notorious for its chronic pollution. Even indoors it's a struggle to find clean air, says John Sudworth. Having already taped most of my windows shut, I have now started on the air conditioning vents. The aim is simple - to close off every access point through which the toxic outside air leaks into our Beijing home. Even our double-glazing doesn't keep out the smog. The most dangerous constituent, particulate matter smaller than 2.5 microns in diameter - or PM2.5 as it's known - finds a way through the tiniest of gaps where the windows close. So the only solution there is duct tape. It's like a re-enactment of a 1970s government information film on surviving a nuclear holocaust. Only it's not radiation we're trying to keep at bay, but the fallout from fossil fuels. The most useful device in our armoury is our PM2.5 monitor. We have two, one upstairs and one downstairs, which we glance at frequently, and it was their arrival that prompted the frenzy of taping and draught-excluding that continues to this day. When I first arrived in China, five years ago, there was no way of monitoring the quality of air in our home. Like everyone else, we left it to blind faith that our air purifiers were doing the trick. It now transpires they weren't. Even now on highly polluted days, we struggle to get our PM2.5 count much below 25 micrograms per cubic meter, the World Health Organization's maximum standard for safe air. And that's with multiple purifiers running at full tilt, large box-like machines that sit in the corner of every room - two in some - the combined noise output of which is akin to living in the engine room of an aircraft carrier. Shoppers look at air purifiers in Beijing China's air pollution problem is now so bad that its effects are measured in more than a million premature deaths a year and markedly reduced life expectancy - an average of more than five years or so - in the worst-affected regions. Over the past few weeks, a period of particularly acute and prolonged air pollution, the average air quality in Beijing has been well above 200 micrograms of PM2.5 particles per cubic metre - many times the maximum safe limit. During the worst of it, it's been like living under house arrest, our children confined to the small, deafening but breathable indoor space of our home for days on end. And across China, the smog becomes a dominant topic on social media, with the population tracking the foulness of the air via mobile phone apps. One group of Beijing mothers, armed with their own PM2.5 counters, have even been roaming the city in search of shopping malls or cafes with filtered air - and then sharing their discoveries online. Of course, humanity's dependence on oil and coal long predate China's economic rise. But China offers a vision of environmental degradation far in excess of the pea-souper fogs of 1950s London or Manchester. For much of the past month the cloud of toxic air hanging over this country has extended for thousands of miles, a giant, continent-sized cocktail of soot from coal fired power stations and car exhausts, smothering the lives and filling the lungs of hundreds of millions of people. From Our Own Correspondenthas insight and analysis from BBC journalists, correspondents and writers from around the world Listen on iPlayer, getthe podcastor listen on the BBC World Service or on Radio 4 on Thursdays at 11:00 BST and Saturdays at 11:30 BST While growing awareness means that more of them are now taking action to protect their health, many others are either not fully informed about the danger or don't have the means to do much about it. A set of new filters for a single air purifier can cost Â£100 ($120) or more and needs changing every six months or so. It is, of course, not a problem only of China's making. The smartphones, computers, TV screens, jeans and shoes that have been pouring out of its factories over the past few decades are cheap, in part at least, precisely because they're made without environmental safeguards. The interests of the rich world and an unaccountable Chinese Communist elite have neatly dovetailed. The West gets its cheap consumer desirables and China gets rich without the inconvenience of the independent scrutiny, regulation or democratic oversight of other markets. The true cost is measured by the numbers on my pollution monitors, and it is one being borne disproportionately by ordinary Chinese people. Following a crackdown on a rare protest against pollution in the central city of Chengdu recently, one blogger dared to speak out in favour of the protesters. The police, he suggested, should bear in mind that the elites, whose interests they protect, have sent their families to breathe clean air overseas. He was promptly detained.

Konta plays down Australian Open chance,"This video can not be played In-form Konta 'happy' before Australian Open Australian Open 2017 Venue:Melbourne Park, MelbourneDates:16-29 Jan Coverage:Live commentary on BBC Radio 5 live sports extra plus TV highlights on BBC Two from 21 Jan; live text on selected matches on BBC Sport website British number one Johanna Konta says it is ""not a given"" that she will be a contender for the Australian Open title despite winning the warm-up tournament. Konta, who broke into the world's top 10 last year, beat Agnieszka Radwanska to win hersecond WTA trophyat the Sydney International on Friday. The 25-year-old begins her campaign against Belgium's Kirsten Flipkens on Tuesday (midnight on Monday in the UK). ""I'm very pleased with the level I played,"" said Konta of her Sydney win. Konta & Murray lead Britain's Australian Open hopes Australian Open draws ""But we all know that it's not a given. It doesn't decide how you will do in the next event. ""I'm taking it as a positive from the week itself, but I'm looking to again work hard here and really try to do the best that I can."" Sydney-born Konta reached the semi-finals at the Australian Open last year - the furthest she has ever progressed in a Grand Slam. And despite enjoying her most successful season to date, she chose to split with coach Esteban Carril in December after two-and-a-half years together. Konta is now working under Belgian Wim Fissette, who has previously coached former world number one Kim Clijsters and two-time Australian Open winner Victoria Azarenka. ""My previous situation came to a natural end so I was in the market. It came together nicely for us,"" Konta told BBC Radio 5 live. ""We're doing some great work together. I'm really enjoying learning from him. He's a coach who's been on tour for some time and has worked with some of the best players. ""I'm trying to be a sponge and trying to absorb all the information he's passing on."" Sue Barker, who reached the semi-finals of the women's singles at the Australian Open in 1975 and 1977, believes Johanna Konta is good enough to win this year's competition. ""Last year's Australian Open was her big breakthrough tournament,"" Barker told BBC Radio 5 live's Sportsweek programme. ""We had been seeing her get better and better but at the Australian Open she started to believe in herself. She has not sat back and has improved week after week. ""I watched her final against Radwanska in Sydney last week and it was the best I've seen her play. She looked incredible and doesn't have a weakness. ""She is hitting the ball so hard and she is not just a top-10 player, she is a Grand Slam contender."" Johanna Konta lost to eventual winner Angelique Kerber in the semi-finals of the 2016 Australian Open Konta will return to ninth in the world rankings on Monday following her win in Sydney and Barker thinks Konta can beat the best players. ""Johanna is seeded ninth so has not got the protection of being in the top eight but there is not one person that's just so outstanding in the women's game,"" added Barker. ""Angelique Kerber is a solid world number one but she is beatable and Johanna has the game to beat her. She certainly has a chance to win it.""

'Victims of their time',"In the 19th Century, children were often imprisoned for what now would be considered minor offences. Seven-year-old Julie-Ann Crumpling (pictured) was jailed at Oxford Castle for allegedly stealing a pram. Her mugshot - and those of other inmates at the jail - have now been made available by the National Archives. ""Youâd think she was just playing with the pram,"" says Becky Attrill, duty manager at the castle. ""They say she tried to deny her crime but she was probably terrified. She was sentenced to seven dayâs hard labour in 1870 and is our youngest prisoner [on record]. She probably worked in the prison's laundry, and when she was released the judge said her father had to start sending her to school, so it was probably the best thing that ever happened to her."" Julie-Ann is pictured here with 12-year-old Sarah Church who was jailed for stealing a sable muff. ""It was very common to have children imprisoned,"" Ms Attrill continues. ""They were treated the same as everyone else. Prisoners were there to work."" The children were typically separated from their family when they were imprisoned. But some parents sent to prison would take their children along with them and they would stay there together. ""The prison was eerily silent because they werenât allowed to speak. It was very much about keeping the prisoners isolated - breaking their bodies and their spirits,"" adds Ms Attrill. The prisoners were often photographed posing on a chair in the manner of a formal family photograph. ""There wasnât an official prison photographer because they were hard to come by,"" said Ms Attrill. ""That style was the way the photographer was used to. It means it doesnât look like theyâre in prison, except their expressions aren't very happy."" Children were typically imprisoned alongside adult criminals. ""A lot of our mugshots are of petty criminals who were victims of their time,"" says Ms Attrill. ""They were all very poor and caught stealing things like bread, and then chucked into prison."" The prison was overcrowded and not very clean and the mortality and disease rates were high. Prisoners were given deliberately pointless jobs. ""The men were pumping water up to the top of St George's Tower, then the women would go with two buckets up the spiral staircase, collect the water, and bring it back down again,"" says Ms Attrill. These days much of the 1,000-year-old castle is a tourist destination, where the mugshots are on display at a permanent exhibition.

Rob Young: City grapples with new EU shake-up15 January 2017 (00:10:20),"The City of London is braced for the chill winds of regulation Financial institutions across the UK are gearing up for one of the most far-reaching regulatory shake-ups they have ever faced. There's a five-letter acronym regularly muttered in the City of London, which leads to some rubbing of chins, looks of bewilderment and groans about the workload. The acronym in question is Mifid 2, the name of a rather technical, complex and, yes, dull-sounding piece of financial legislation from the EU. It stands for the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive. Mifid 2 means big changes for banks across Europe over the next year. ""It's a complete system change, very detailed,"" says Anthony Browne, who runs the British Bankers' Association (BBA). ""It is changing their IT systems, changing the way their whole systems operate right from the front end and the information the traders put in to the back end and information they provide to clients; it's also the documentation they provide for their clients, and information they give to regulators themselves."" The rules run to more than 1,000 pages. The new rulebook - or perhaps rule ""tome"", more accurately - is the EU's response to the financial crisis. A decade on from that scarring experience, the European Commission predicts the law will be transformative for markets. Despite the Brexit vote, the City still has to abide by the new EU regulations Many banks back the new rules, saying they will help avoid a rerun of 2007-08 by bringing in more transparency and giving investors greater protection. Some companies, though, say they are too tough and have already led to job losses. ""It is the unintended consequences that could be the problem here,"" says Julian Allen-Ellis from the EFMA financial markets trade body. ""The operational cost of both buy-side and sell-side setting up for this new regulation could mean profitability is impacted and that ultimately impacts the person on the street with their pension and their portfolio."" So why Mifid 2? It's the sequel to Mifid 1, which has been in force since November 2007 That made it easier and cheaper to buy investments across the EU, by allowing investment firms to operate across borders more easily But the financial crash exposed some of its weaknesses So the European Commission now wants to make financial markets ""more efficient, resilient and transparent"" and to ""strengthen the protection of investors"" The new regulations come into force in 2018 A recent survey of the City by PA Consulting suggested two out of five companies were not prepared enough to implement the new rules. They'd better get a move on. The sprawling regulations come into force in January 2018. There are some who argue that these complex EU rules could be a big help to the City after Brexit, because they contain something called ""equivalence"". That allows financial companies from outside the EU to do business inside it, as long as their home country has the same standards of regulation. The City is wary of what Mifid 2 will usher in ""Potentially this could be a way through the mire,"" says David Biggin, an adviser at PA Consulting. ""For a lot of the companies talking about relocating, actually this rule might allow some light at the end of the tunnel. It's a technocratic decision rather than a political decision. It is a way forward."" However, not everyone thinks ""equivalence"" will save the City's bacon if it finds itself with less favourable access to the EU than it has today. ""The main drawback is it can be withdrawn unilaterally at any time,"" warns the BBA's Anthony Browne. He has other concerns too. ""This would be a political process done at a time when the UK is negotiating its divorce arrangements from the EU, and when it's thinking about negotiating a trade deal with the EU. The chance we would get agreement on equivalence, to come in the day the UK leaves the EU, seems hopeful at best."" The experience of some countries already outside the EU seem to bear that fear out. Several have already applied for ""equivalence"" status under previous financial rules. Guernsey is one of them. The Crown dependency has beefed up its laws, and they have been judged as technically the same as the EU's by an EU regulator, no less. Guernsey is now waiting for the European Commission to give it the final nod - and has been for two years. ""The technical decision was made. Now it's become a political decision,"" says Christopher Jehan from the Guernsey Investment Fund Association. ""That political decision is effectively the roadblock for us,"" he says. ""They're using whatever reason they have for anything else going on in the world as a delaying tactic."" Guernsey's experience does not bode well for those in the UK who think these new complex EU rules will help the City after Brexit. But Mifid 2 is already bringing about big regulatory change in the City, the scale of which it has rarely seen.

Theo Leggett: VW papers shed light on emissions scandal12 January 2017 (23:15:47),"US Attorney-General Loretta Lynch said VW denied and then lied in a bid to cover up its actions ""Volkswagen obfuscated, they denied, and they ultimately lied."" These were the words of the US Attorney General Loretta Lynch, as she set out how the German carmaker would be punished for attempting to hoodwink the US authorities over the emissions produced by its diesel cars. It has been a tough week for Volkswagen. It has been fined $4.3bn, agreed to plead guilty to criminal charges - and six executives are facing charges. One of them, Oliver Schmidt, has spent the past few days in a Miami jail. Others may yet find themselves in the firing line. But because of this, we now have a very clear idea not only of what Volkswagen was doing wrong, and how it went about it, but also the measures that were taken to conceal that wrongdoing. As part of its plea bargain with the US authorities Volkswagen signed up to an agreed ""Statement of Facts"". It draws heavily on the results of an investigation by the law firm Jones Day, commissioned by VW itself. The FBI makes further detailed allegations in its criminal complaint against Oliver Schmidt. These have not yet been tested or admitted. According to these documents, the seeds of the scandal were sown in 2006, when VW were designing a new diesel engine for the US market. Supervisors in the engine department realised they had a problem. They could not design an engine that would meet tough emissions standards due to enter into force in 2007, and at the same time give customers the performance that they wanted. Their solution was to ask their engineers to design engine management software which would turn on emissions controls when the car was being tested, and turn them off when it was being driven on the road. This 'defeat device' software was able to recognise the standard testing procedure. It was based on a program developed by VW's subsidiary Audi, which engineers had specifically stated should ""absolutely not be used"" in the US. Not everyone was happy about this, it seems. Engineers ""raised objections to the propriety of the defeat device"" in late 2006. In response, a manager decided that production should continue, still using the device. He also ""instructed those in attendance, in sum and substance, not to get caught"". A similar row broke out the following year, and again, the decision was taken to press on regardless. Subsequently, the use of the defeat device appears to have become routine. The Statement of Facts describes how the software was refined and improved over time. A spate of breakdowns was blamed on the cars remaining in 'test' mode while being driven on the road. Supervisors worked with engineers to solve the problem, and ""encouraged the further concealment of the software"". The engineers were also told to destroy documents relating to the issue. The deception came to a head when, in 2014, the California Air Resources Board approached the company to find out why tests had shown that its cars were emitting up to 40 times the permissible amount of nitrogen oxides when driven on the road. VW supervisors ""determined not to disclose to US regulators that the tested vehicle models operated with a defeat device"". Instead they ""decided to pursue a strategy of concealing the defeat deviceâ¦ while appearing to cooperate"". The FBI claims in its criminal complaint against Mr Schmidt - who was a head of compliance at VW's US division from 2012 to 2015 - that the deception eventually went to the very top of the company. Citing ""co-operative witnesses"" and allegedly corroborating documentation, it claims that the company's executive management in Wolfsburg were briefed on the issue in July 2015. Rather than tell its staff to come clean about the defeat device, it says, ""VW executive management authorized its continued concealment"". There is, however, no mention of this meeting in the statement agreed by Volkswagen. Ultimately, Volkswagen's wrongdoing was confirmed to the authorities by a single employee acting ""in direct contravention of instructions from supervisors at VW"". But the deception did not end there. The Statement of Facts explains how VW staff were warned by an in-house lawyer that the authorities were about to circulate a so-called ""hold notice"", obliging them to retain and preserve documents under their control. Engineers were told to ""check their documents"", which several of those present ""understood to mean that they should delete their documents"". The message was repeated at a number of subsequent meetings, one of them attended by 30-40 people and ultimately thousands of documents were deleted. When the scandal at Volkswagen first came to light, the company's former US chief executive, Michael Horn blamed ""a couple of software engineers"". It is now clear that many more people were involved, at least some of them in positions of authority, and deliberate attempts were made to cover up wrongdoing. It is not hard, then, to see why the US authorities have taken such a tough line with the company. But some questions remain unanswered. We still don't know for certain, for example, whether people at board level knew what was going on. It's also unclear why the same software that was fitted illegally to 600,000 US vehicles was also present on millions of others sold around the world, including eight million in Europe. VW continues to maintain that the systems didn't actually break European law - though it is in the process of repairing those vehicles all the same.

Cast ashore,"Police officers called to a beach in Wapping to investigate a possible 'unexploded device' were surprised to learn that it was in fact... a Christmas bauble. Tower Hamlets Police shared a picture of the bauble on Twitter, saying: ""Officers were called to Wapping to investigate a possible unexploded device that had been washed up on the shore. Luckily, upon closer inspection, it is a giant glittery Christmas bauble! ðð"" People responded by joking about how big the Christmas tree must have been to hold a bauble of that size! In August 2017, two enormous plastic pipes washed up on beaches at Winterton and Sea Palling in Norfolk, England. They were 450 metres long and came loose whilst being transported to North Africa. Ten more pipes were reported to still be out at sea at the time - we hope they found them all! Well this *certainly* isn't a Christmas bauble! In the summer of 2016, a giant oil rig washed up on to a beach on the Isle of Lewis in Scotland. The rig was being transported by sea from Norway to Malta when stormy weather hit and it became separated from the boat that was pulling it along. Also in 2016, thousands of bright pink plastic detergent bottles washed up on beaches in Cornwall. Most of the bottles were sealed closed, but it's thought that some may have leaked so people were told to avoid the beaches until they were cleaned. 2014 saw dozens of huge barrel jellyfish wash up on beaches in Dorset. They are the biggest type of jellyfish found in UK waters. It's believed strong winds had brought the tide high and left some of the strange creatures stranded. In 1997, a goods container filled with millions of Lego pieces fell off a ship and into the sea. Since then hundreds of Lego pieces have been washing up on beaches in Cornwall. For years, blocks of a rubbery material engraved with the word TJIPETIR have been washing up on beaches all over Europe. It's believed the blocks may have originally come from a small Indonesian village that was the site of a Indonesian rubber plantation built in the 19th century.

Lemon-aid,"Various signs of breast cancer, as shown on lemons, to increase awareness We think we know what the signs of breast cancer are, until it comes to checking our own breasts - then we're not so sure. Is that a lump I can feel? Should I be worried about the dimpled skin there? What exactly am I feeling for? Those were the concerns of Corrine Beaumont, a young designer, who created the'Know Your Lemons' campaign,external, which has been shared more than 32,000 times on Facebook in the past few days. She lost both her grandmothers to breast cancer at the ages of 40 and 62 and when she found very little information on the signs of breast cancer to look out for, she felt compelled to come up with a solution. Lemons became her stand-in metaphor for breasts as she tried to create a simple, visual way of showing what breast cancer symptoms can look and feel like. Corrine describes the egg box of lemons as a playful, friendly image which might help women overcome their fear of the disease. ""Some patients don't want to talk about breasts or look at them,"" she says. ""Often women used in campaigns don't look like ordinary women - but even those with little literacy can understand this."" The campaign has been used to educate people in the US, Spain, Turkey and Lebanon - and translated into 16 different languages. Join the debate on ourFacebook page,external. Two years ago Corrine left her job to start her own charity,Worldwide Breast Cancer,external. Although 'Know Your Lemons' has been going since 2003, this year's zesty campaign image has struck a chord, after it was shared on social media byErin Smith Chieze,external. She was diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer after recognising she had an indentation in her breast, all thanks to a similar image detailing what breast cancer could look like. ""Without having seen a picture randomly with real information, I wouldn't have known what to look for,"" Erin posted. Many say 'Know Your Lemons' is clear and colourful - and gets an important message across that is often lost in a mass of words. Breast Cancer Care says women should introduce self-checking as part of a routine And they have a point. A recent survey of 1,000 women by charity Breast Cancer Care found that a third of women don't check their breast regularly for signs and symptoms of cancer. While 96% know that a lump in the breast can be a symptom of cancer, more than a quarter did not know that an inverted nipple can be a symptom. A lump or an area of thickened tissue in their breast is the most common symptom of breast cancer which women notice, NHS Choices says. In 9 out of 10 cases these lumps are not cancer, but it's always a good idea to visit your GP to check. Other common symptoms to look out for are dimpling of the skin, indentations in the breast and a change in the position of the nipple. Prof Jayant Vaidya, professor of surgery and oncology at University College London, says indentation or flattening of the breast, particularly when the arm is lifted or when women lean forward, is an important early sign. ""Apart from bloody or single duct discharge from the nipple, it is the main visible early sign."" But he says that growing veins and inflamed breasts are rare symptoms, and skin erosion, orange peel skin and large bumps are signs of advanced disease. ""Showing lemons in an egg box seems to draw interest and attention to the issue and people may remember the signs better. ""But women will usually find the new 'invisible' lump in their breasts; it is the most common and frequently the only symptom."" In the UK, awareness is already at a pretty high level, so delay is more likely due to fear or denial, he says. ""Modern targeted treatments have a high chance of success and are aimed at reducing the harms of over-treatment,"" Prof Vaidya adds. Breast Cancer Care -how to check your breasts,external Breast Cancer Now -what are the signs and symptoms of breast cancer,external Cancer Research UK -being breast aware,external What is important, breast cancer charities say, is being aware of how your own breasts feel normally and then looking out for any unusual changes. A change in size or shape, a lump or thickening anywhere in the breast should be taken seriously. However, Jane Murphy, clinical nurse specialist at Breast Cancer Care, says she doesn't want people to become paranoid about breast cancer. ""It's about everyone becoming familiar with their own body and knowing what your own breast look like. ""You can introduce self-checking as part of a routine, when you're putting on creams and lotions, for example."" Cancer Research UK points out that spotting a sign doesn't necessarily mean cancer. ""Inverted nipples, fluid leaking from a nipple or a rash can all be due to other medical conditions. ""But if you have any changes to what is normal for you, you should see your GP. ""Seeing your doctor early also means that if it does turn out to be cancer, you give yourself the best chance of successful treatment.""

Coding pioneer,"Joyce Wheeler was one of a select group of scientists who used Edsac in their research Everyone remembers the first computer they ever used. And Joyce Wheeler is no exception. But in her case the situation was a bit different. The first computer she used was one of the first computers anyone used. The machine was Edsac - the Electronic Delay Storage Automatic Calculator - that ran for the first time in 1949 and was built to serve scientists at the University of Cambridge. Joyce Wheeler was one of those scientists who, at the time, was working on her PhD under the supervision of renowned astronomer Fred Hoyle. ""My work was about the reactions inside stars,"" she said. ""I was particularly interested in how long main sequence stars stay on their main sequence. ""I wanted to know how long a star took to fade out,"" she explained. The inner workings of the nuclear furnace that keep stars shining is an understandably knotty problem to solve. And, she said, the maths describing that energetic process were formidable. ""For stars, there's a rather nasty set of differential equations that describe their behaviour and composition,"" she added. Edsac helped Dr Wheeler investigate what processes keep stars burning Completing those calculations manually was futile. ""It was not possible to be really accurate doing it by hand,"" she said. ""The errors just build up too much."" Enter Edsac - a machine created by Prof Maurice Wilkes to do exactly the kind of calculations Ms Wheeler (nee Blackler) needed done to complete her advanced degree. First though, she had to learn to write the programs that would carry out the calculations. Dr Wheeler started her PhD work at Cambridge in 1954 knowing about Edsac thanks to an earlier visit during which the machine had been shown off to her and others. Keen to get on with her research she sat down with the slim booklet that described how to program it and, by working through the exercises in that pioneering programming manual, learned to code. Research students like Joyce Wheeler had to use Edsac at night The little book was called WWG after its three authors Maurice Wilkes, David Wheeler and Stanley Gill. It was through learning programming that Ms Blackler got talking to David Wheeler because one of her programs helped to ensure Edsac was working well. They got to know each other, fell in love and married in 1957. Now, more than 62 years on she is very matter of fact about that time - even though programmers, and especially women programmers, were rare. Perhaps because of that novel situation, a new discipline and a pioneering machine, the atmosphere at Cambridge in the computer lab was not overwhelmingly masculine. ""You could be regarded as a bit of an object, and occasionally it was a bit uncomfortable,"" she said, ""But it was not quite a boys' brigade then in the way that it became later on."" It was an exciting time, she said, because of what the machine could do for her and her work. She took to programming quickly, she said, her strength with maths helping her quickly master the syntax into which she had to translate those ""nasty equations"". ""But it was like maths,"" she said, ""it was one of those things that you knew you should not do for too long. The foundations of programming were laid down by Edsac's creators ""I found I could not work at a certain programming job for more than a certain number of hours per day,"" she said. ""After that you would not make much progress."" Often, she said, the solution to a programming problem she had been worrying away at would strike while she was engaged in something more mundane, like doing the washing or eating lunch. ""Sometimes it's better to leave something alone, to pause, and that's very true of programming."" With the programming done, she could let Edsac do the number crunching. As a research student she had to run her programs during the night. In her case that was Friday. ""That was good because there were no lectures the next day that you had to go to,"" she said. As an operator she was allowed to run Edsac alone, provided she signed in and kept a record of what she did. ""Quite often it would break down during the night, but just occasionally you were lucky enough to keep it running all night,"" she said.  ""If it did crash, there was little that operators were allowed to do to try to fix it. ""They didn't even let any of the cleaners get near it,"" she said. Dr Wheeler had been shown one procedure that recalibrated Edsac's two kilobyte memory but if that did not help, then her work would stop for the night. Despite the regular crashes, Ms Wheeler made steady progress on finding out how long different stars would last before they collapsed. A copy of Edsac is being built at the National Museum of Computing ""I got some estimates of a star's age, how long it was going to last,"" she said. ""One of the nice things was that with programming you could repeat it. Iterate. You could not do that with a hand calculation. ""We could add in sample numbers on programs and it could easily check them,"" she added. ""I could check my results on the machine very rapidly, which was very useful."" Rapidly in the 1950s meant about 30 minutes for the machine to complete one run of a program. Then the results were printed out for researchers to pore over to see what results they had got. Then it was a case of re-programming and perhaps waiting a few days to have a chance to run a slightly modified program on Edsac.
