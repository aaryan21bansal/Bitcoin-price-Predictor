How a razor revolutionised the way we pay for stuff,"The man who founded the Gillette corporation, King Camp Gillette, had some surprising philosophical ideas. In 1894, Gillette published a book arguing that ""our present system of competition"" breeds ""extravagance, poverty, and crime"". He advocated a new system of ""equality, virtue, and happiness"", in which just one corporation - the United Company - would make all of life's necessities, as cost-effectively as possible. Gillette's book called for everyone in North America to live in a single city, called Metropolis. He imagined ""mammoth apartment housesâ¦ upon a scale of magnificence such as no civilization has ever known"", connected by artificial parks with ""domes of coloured glass in beautiful designs"". It would be, he said, ""an endless gallery of loveliness"". His idea didn't take off. But a year later, in 1895, King Camp Gillette had another brainwave that really did change the world. He invented the disposable razor blade. 50 Things That Made the Modern Economyhighlights the inventions, ideas and innovations that helped create the economic world. It is broadcast on the BBC World Service. You can findmore information about the programme's sourcesandlisten onlineorsubscribe to the programme podcast. It revolutionised more than shaving. Gillette's blade led to a business model that has become ubiquitous in the modern economy. That model is called two-part pricing. If you have ever bought replacement cartridges for an inkjet printer, you may well have been annoyed to discover they cost almost as much as you paid for the printer itself. That seems to make no sense. The printer is a reasonably large and complicated piece of technology. How can it possibly add only a negligible amount to the cost of supplying a bit of ink in tiny plastic pots? The answer, of course, is that it doesn't. But for a manufacturer, selling the printer cheaply and the ink expensively is a business model that makes sense. After all, what's the alternative? Buy a whole new printer from a rival manufacturer? As long as that is even slightly more expensive than the new ink for your current printer, you will reluctantly pay up. King Camp Gillette realised he could charge people a premium for the blades for his razor Two-part pricing is also known as the ""razor and blades"" model, because that's where it first drew attention - draw people in with an attractively priced razor, then repeatedly charge them for expensive replacement blades. Before King Camp Gillette, razors were bigger, chunkier affairs - and a significant enough expense that when the blade got dull, you would sharpen - or ""strop"" - it, not chuck it away and buy another. Gillette realised that if he devised a clever holder for the blade, to keep it rigid, he could make the blade much thinner - and hence much cheaper to produce. He did not immediately hit upon the two-part pricing model, though. Initially, he made both parts expensive. Gillette's razor cost $5 (Â£4) - about a third of the average worker's weekly wage. The Gillette razor was so eye-wateringly exorbitant that the 1913 Sears catalogue offered it with an apology that it was not legally allowed to discount the price. It also included an annoyed-sounding disclaimer: ""Gillette safety razors are quoted for the accommodation of some of our customers who want this particular razor. We don't claim that this razor will give better satisfaction than the lower-priced safety razors quoted on this page."" The model of cheap razors and expensive blades evolved only later, as Gillette's patents expired and competitors got in on the act. Nowadays, two-part pricing is everywhere. Consider the PlayStation 4. The Sony PlayStation 4, which went on sale in November 2013, has surpassed 40 million sales worldwide Every time Sony sells one, it loses money: the retail price is less than it costs to manufacture and distribute. But that is OK, because Sony makes its money whenever a PlayStation 4 owner buys a game. Or how about Nespresso? Nestle profits not from selling the machine, but the coffee pods. Obviously, for this model to work you need some way to prevent customers putting cheap, generic blades in your razor. One solution is legal: patent-protect your blades. But patents don't last forever. Patents on coffee pods have started expiring, so brands such as Nespresso now face competitors selling cheap, compatible alternatives. Some are looking for another kind of solution: technological. Just as other people's games don't work on the PlayStation, and non-branded print cartridges may not work in some printers, coffee companies have put chip readers in their machines to stop you sneakily trying to brew up a generic cup. Nespresso makes more money from selling its coffee pods than the coffee machines Two-part pricing models work by imposing what economists call ""switching costs"". Want to brew another brand's coffee? Then buy another machine. They are especially prevalent with digital goods. If you have a huge library of games for your PlayStation, or books for your Kindle, it is a big thing to switch to another platform. Switching costs don't have to be financial. They can come in the form of time, or hassle. If I am already familiar with Adobe's Photoshop software, I might prefer to pay for an expensive upgrade rather than buy a cheaper alternative, which I would then have to learn how to use. That is why software vendors offer free trials, and why banks and utilities offer special ""teaser"" rates to draw people in. When they quietly raise the price, many will not bother to change. Switching costs can be psychological, too - a result of brand loyalty. If Gillette's marketing department persuades me that generic blades give an inferior shave, then I will happily keep paying extra for Gillette-branded blades. That may explain the otherwise curious fact that Gillette's profits increased after his patents expired and competitors could make compatible blades. How Ikea's Billy took over the world How economics killed the antibiotic dream How the invention of paper changed the world What makes gambling wrong but insurance right? Perhaps, by then, customers had got used to thinking of Gillette as a high-end brand, worth paying a premium for. Two-part pricing can be highly inefficient, and economists have puzzled over why consumers stand for it. The most plausible explanation is that they get confused. Either they don't realise they will be exploited later, or they do realise but find it hard to think ahead and pick out the best deal. The irony is that the razors-and-blades model - charging customers a premium for basics such as ink and coffee - is about as far as you can get from King Camp Gillette's vision of a single United Company producing life's necessities as cheaply as possible. Evidently, it's easier to inspire a new model for business than a new model for society.

Decoding Russia's response to Johnson's cancelled trip,"The Russian embassy in London called Mr Johnson's cancellation deplorable and absurd The Russians have reacted with a mixture of contempt and fury to the cancellation of the foreign secretary's trip to Moscow. It suggests they do, perhaps surprisingly, care quite a lot about it. In a series of tweets, the Russian embassy in London mocked the foreign secretary, calling his decision ""deplorable"" and ""absurd"" and linking to an image of the Charge of the Light Brigade and Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture. That was the year that a minor war between Britain and Russia, provoked by a Russian alliance with France, came to an end, when Napoleon invaded Russia. The US was on the French side. The message is a little hard to decode, beyond poking fun at Boris. The Kremlin is less mischievous, and more straightforward. It ""doubts in the presence of added value in speaking to the UK, which does not have its own position on the majority of present-day issues, nor does it have real influence on the course of international affairs, as it remains 'in the shadow' of its strategic partners. We do not feel that we need dialogue with London any more than it does."" One of the Russian embassy's tweets referred to the Charge of the Light Brigade This has both the whiff of wounded pride and the smell of an unpalatable truth. Both interpretations have something in them, but disguise a more profound method in their mockery. Russia's intervention in Syria had many fathers, but no doubt part of President Putin's purpose was to establish that modern Russia, just as much as the old Soviet Union, matters on the world stage - a force to be reckoned with, on a par with China and the US. Boris Johnson calls off Moscow visit over Syria Russia hits out over Boris Johnson's decision to cancel Moscow trip Syria 'chemical attack': What we know Syria 'chemical attack': What now? So a snub from Britain, definitely lower down the league table of powerful nations, stings a little bit. It is also easy to take a tilt at the UK and Boris Johnson. We do, in military, intelligence and diplomatic terms, in that old cliche, punch above our weight. We matter more, in those terms, than Sweden or Brazil, Spain or Italy. But the weight of our history makes many of us think we matter more than we do. We have lost an empire and don't particularly like finding ourselves in a subordinate role, perhaps not always as important as France and Germany. Absurdly, our media and politicians sometimes like to pretend we are almost on a par with the United States, nearly equal partners rather than occasionally useful allies. The Russians are deeply aware of how much power they have lost. We in Britain simply pretend it's not the case. So the Kremlin prodding a finger in this wound makes us shiver a little bit. US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is due to visit Moscow on 12 April I have no idea whether US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson asked tentatively and politely that Boris should call off his visit, virtually ordered it, or whether the proposal came from the Foreign Office. But there's no doubt we are doing what the Americans want, and waiting for them to explain what they want to happen next. This is what the Russians really hate. Like the Chinese, they would rather have one-on-one, bilateral relations, with other smaller nations. It is why they would love to see the European Union collapse, and support parties which wish to see that too. They don't like other countries acting against them in concord, matching their mass. If they don't like the EU, they feel even more strongly about European nations acting together with the US. Bundle in the G7 nations of Japan and Canada, and you have something that amounts to '""the West"" - the Soviet Union's old adversary. Though the faces may change, the G7 group remains, to some, the face of ""the West"" If they had hoped the US would turn inward, not even leading from behind, but wandering off in a disinterested daze, then recent developments seem to suggest they won't get their wish. So Boris Johnson's cancelled trip to Moscow makes diplomatic sense and shows a due sense of proportion about our nation's power. But it is still not great for the man himself. Hanging over all this is the feeling that he's not to be trusted, that he'd somehow make a mess of it all. The Russians keep using the term ""clown"" and hinting that he is out of his depth. Some in the Foreign Office seem to agree. So do opposition politicians. It may be desperately unfair, based on the fact he makes a few broad jokes in a world where many others have carefully crafted pokers inserted somewhere about their person. But Boris has become a politician it is easy not to take seriously, a doddle to ridicule. President Trump's example suggests that's not entirely a bad place to be, but at the moment it has made it easier for people at home and abroad to deride an entirely standard diplomatic response.

Could private investors fund a new wave of hospitals?,"The NHS in England is under financial strain. Keeping control of day-to-day spending has proved immensely challenging. Now its emerged that health service leaders have turned to private sector financiers to fund repairs and modernisation of hospitals. So how realistic is the involvement of private money and could there be a repeat of the mistakes made with the controversial Private Finance Initiative (PFI)? Budgets for investment, known as capital, have been raided in recent years by the Department of Health to help hospitals and other trusts in England cover their running costs. NHS leaders are now pushing for investment to allow them to repair decaying buildings, upgrade facilities and fund new plans to develop care in local communities.  If central government funding is limited, they argue, the alternative is private finance. Jim Mackey who heads the financial regulator NHS Improvement, along with other health service officials, has had discussions with private financial institutions. My understanding is that they are at the conservative end of the spectrum, for example pension funds, rather than the racier speculators seen in dramas like ""Billions"". Pension funds and other long term investors are always looking for secure long term havens with a regular stream of income. They are already pursuing public sector infrastructure schemes and have now expressed a willingness to lend money for health service building projects. Mr Mackey recently told Health Service Journal: ""An NHS Fund could power the improvement needed to sort out problems at our hospitals and to drive the change required to get the NHS ready for future challenges. If we are open to new ideas then we could really be in business."" A leading former hospital chief executive Sir Robert Naylor recently produced a report for the Department of Health which argued that without investment  ""the NHS estate will remain unfit for purpose and will continue to deteriorate"". Sir Robert said that Â£10 billion was required both for backlog maintenance work and transforming services, Â£5 billion of which might be raised by selling off unwanted properties. That leaves a Â£5 billion gap to come from somewhere. It all sounds straightforward but these things often do. The Treasury has to be convinced that the sums add up and to that end are in talks with Mr Mackey and his NHS colleagues. Officials are haunted by the memory of the original PFI which delivered sparkling new hospitals but with numerous strings attached. Taxpayers came out badly from the original PFI deals and the costs will mount up for hospitals over decades. Some will argue that the obvious answer to NHS funding challenges is higher public borrowing. The interest rates which HM Government pays on its debt are at or close to historic low levels. If the Treasury can borrow cheaply to invest in hospitals, why involve the private sector which will need to build a profit margin into any deal with the NHS? Whitehall sources indicate that Mr Mackey's talks are at an early stage and nothing has been approved. They point out that the Chancellor Philip Hammond did announce new capital investment for the NHS in the Budget and has promised more in the Autumn Statement. But at a time when he is trying to keep deficit reduction on track, borrowing a lot more for the NHS may have limited appeal for Mr Hammond. The Â£5 billion investment challenge for England's hospitals is out there. NHS leaders know that it needs to be addressed and that the private sector could help. The question now is whether ministers and Treasury mandarins can trust them to do the right deals and, if not, where the money might come from.

Six key cases Neil Gorsuch could rule on,"Mr Gorsuch will be confirmed as a Supreme Court justice on Monday Neil Gorsuch has been confirmed as a Supreme Court justice, following a bitter and partisan battle over his nomination by President Trump. The conservative judge could be required early on to weigh in on several hot-button issues due before the court, including religious freedoms, gun rights and Mr Trump's travel ban. Other cases which deadlocked between the eight current justices may be reheard now that there is a ninth justice in place to break the tie on America's highest court. Here are some of the key cases he may have a hand in deciding in the coming weeks and months. Trinity Lutheran Church of Columbia v Comer One of the first cases Justice Gorsuch will hear, with oral arguments due to begin next week, concerns separation of church and state. A school run by Trinity Lutheran Church in Missouri sought to take part in a state programme that resurfaces playgrounds with rubber from recycled tires. But the Missouri Department of Natural Resources denied the request, arguing that the state constitution prohibited funding of religious organisations. Representing the church, the Alliance Defending Freedom said the denial infringed the church's First Amendment rights. The case was accepted by the court in January last year but delayed a hearing for 15 months. This video can not be played Neil Gorsuch could influence American policy for decades Masterpiece Cakeshop v Colorado Civil Rights Commission The Supreme Court is due to decide this week whether to accept the case of a baker in Colorado who refused to make a wedding cake for a gay couple, on religious grounds. The lower courts found that the owners of Masterpiece Cakeshop had violated Colorado's Anti-Discrimination Act (CADA), and the decision was upheld by the Colorado Court of Appeals. The case has been under consideration for acceptance by the Supreme Court since January, suggesting that Judge Gorsuch could tip the balance either way. He has previously found in favour of religious freedoms in the workplace, including in two of his most well-known cases. In Burwell v Hobby Lobby and Little Sisters of the Poor v Burwell, Judge Gorsuch ruled that a requirement for employers to cover contraception under their health insurance plans infringed their religious freedoms. Neil Gorsuch: Who is Trump's nominee? Republicans go 'nuclear' to ram through Gorsuch Gorsuch says President Trump not above the law Peruta v San Diego This takes up a lower court ruling that said the second amendment alone did not grant California gun owners the right to carry a concealed weapon in public places. The ruling granted counties the right to apply additional tests before granting a permit, including whether the applicant showed ""good cause"" to require it. The argument essentially boils down to whether the existing right to gun ownership for self defence at home extends to carrying a concealed weapon in public places. ""Any prohibition or restriction a state may choose to impose on concealed carry - including a requirement of 'good cause,' however defined - is necessarily allowed by the [Second] Amendment,"" said the lower court ruling. The ruling led to variation across counties, with some sheriff's offices denying nearly all concealed carry applications. The restrictions are being challenged by a group of Second Amendment campaigners. President Trump's controversial executive order banning travel from six Muslim-majority countries is probably heading to the Supreme Court later this year. Justice Gorsuch repeatedly declined to comment on the issue during his confirmation hearings, but a Supreme Court case would provide a public test of his independence from Mr Trump, who nominated him for the court. The order is due to go before the Fourth Circuit and Ninth Circuit court in May. Another immigration issue which could make its way to the court at some point is Mr Trump's attempt to strip federal funding from so-called ""sanctuary cities"" - cities that refuse to comply with federal orders to detain immigrants. Hernandez v Mesa This is the case of a 15-year-old unarmed Mexican boy who was on the Mexican side of the border when he was shot dead in 2010 by a US border patrol agent, in disputed circumstances. Sergio Hernandez's family want to sue the agent for infringing the boy's constitutional rights. The Supreme Court has already heard oral arguments in the case but the justices did not reach any conclusion. That opens the way for the case to be reheard with Justice Gorsuch on the bench. North Carolina v North Carolina NAACP In July, judges on the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against a North Carolina voting overhaul that they said targeted African Americans ""with almost surgical precision"". The case went to the Supreme Court in August but split the justices 4/4 over whether to prevent the overhaul coming into effect before November's general election. With the case due to go before the court again, Judge Gorsuch could swing the result either way.

Olivier Awards: It wasn't all about Harry Potter,"Harry Potter and the Cursed Child may have cast a spell over the Olivier Awards, but it wasn't the only topic of conversation. Here are a few other things were learned backstage and on the red carpet. Anna Martine Freeman Rotterdam, about a lesbian couple, one of whom wants to start living as a man, won the award for outstanding achievement in an affiliate theatre. ""It's really exciting that trans-narratives are being brought into the mainstream,"" said Anna Martine Freeman, who plays the lead character of Fiona/Adrian. ""As far as we have been made aware, it is the first transgender-themed play to be nominated at an Olivier Awards."" Jon Brittain's comedy started at fringe venue Theatre 503 and transferred to Trafalgar Studios, and will play in New York next month. ""It's come from what feels like humble beginnings and is really flying,"" Anna told the BBC. ""With everything going on, I'd love for Rotterdam to have a larger effect on inclusion and understanding around the world."" John Tiffany (left) shares a joke backstage with Star Wars actor John Boyega Sir Kenneth Branagh and Andrew Lloyd Webber were among those who spoke out on stage in support of arts in education. So too did Cursed Child director John Tiffany who admitted backstage he got angry about cuts to arts subjects in state schools. ""I'm doing what I'm doing because of free guitar lessons, because I had a grant to go to university... and they don't exist anymore,"" he said. ""If I was graduating from high school now I certainly wouldn't be holding this,"" he added, waving his Olivier statuette. ""And I'm not being dramatic!"" More backstage laughs from Tim Minchin Groundhog Day, which won best new musical, is about to open on Broadway after its run last year at the Old Vic. ""The production here was gorgeous and came after thousands of hours of grind and self-doubt,"" songwriter Tim Minchin told us. ""It closed and that was always the plan, but we'll be back here within the year,"" he added. In the West End? ""Certainly that's the plan. It'll come back before you know it."" Which all sounds a bit like the plot of Groundhog Day. Amber Riley stars in Dreamgirls ""I'm in a show where the three leads are three black women - I think that's exceptional,"" said Amber Riley backstage after picking up her award for best actress in a musical. ""In the theatre you want to see people who look like you sometimes,"" the Dreamgirls star said. ""I'm not ashamed to say I'm not necessarily the standard of what the industry may feel is beautiful or could be a star,  but I'm doing it anyway because I'm making my own way."" Denise Gough (left) with best actress winner Billie Piper and Andrew Garfield Last year's best actress winner Denise Gough presented this year's award to Billie Piper. The Irish actress will be back on stage at the National Theatre soon - after her acclaimed performance in People, Places and Things - in the epic Angels in America. Tony Kushner's two-part play is set in mid-1980s New York in the midst of the Aids crisis. Gough plays Harper Pitt in a cast that includes Andrew Garfield (her co-presenter at the Oliviers), Nathan Lane, James McArdle and Russell Tovey. ""It's the hardest job I've ever done,"" Gough confided on the red carpet.  ""There were three rehearsal rooms going at one time. It's been a big gig.""

The bad news that inspired a woman's sparkling success,"Karen Lynch has transformed Belu's fortunes It was the double blow of the death of a best friend and a health problem that made Karen Lynch decide to quit the corporate rat race. ""Losing my close friend made me realise life is too short,"" says Karen, now the boss of bottled water business Belu. ""I wanted to do something more personal."" So in 2008, then aged 38, Karen resigned from her senior role at banking group Barclays. Also learning to live with type 1 diabetes, she and her husband travelled around the Caribbean, Vietnam and Thailand for six months. Upon returning to the UK Karen applied for and got a job as marketing director at Belu, the UK's first carbon-neutral bottled water firm and a social enterprise that gives all its profits to charity. Unfortunately, at the time it wasn't actually making any money. Set up in London in 2004, by 2008 it was saddled with debts of Â£1.9m. Karen realised that Belu needed a major shake-up if it was going to be a success, and after knocking up a business plan outlining her vision, eight months later she was promoted to chief executive. Her plan was to pivot the business away from targeting the supermarkets and their low margins, to instead focus on supplying the more lucrative hotels, restaurants and offices. Belu gives its profits to the charity WaterAid Belu had been founded by filmmaker Reed Paget, who stepped down from the top job for Karen to replace him. ""Clearly it wouldn't have been the easiest time for either of us, but we did lunch and cleared the air. And Reed wanted nothing more than to see Belu become successful in a sustainable way,"" says Karen. ""When I joined Belu it was in debt and it wasn't sustainable. We could have wound up completely - it was time to move on. So we kept the name, but everything changed."" Her business plan was so successful that sales have since soared, with annual revenues of Â£5.9m in 2015. And since 2011 Belu has donated more than Â£1.5m to WaterAid, the global charity that aims to give more people in the developing world access to safe drinking water and good sanitation. Karen decided to move Belu away from supermarkets to restaurants and hotels Karen says that hotels and restaurants were keen to come on board because they welcomed Belu's commitment to environmental best practice, which she decided to strengthen and promote as much as possible. In addition to being carbon neutral, and donating to WaterAid, the company's bottles are made from recycled glass and plastic. ""It was important to demonstrate we're doing this properly. First and foremost about our social and environmental mission, and secondly through building sustainability by giving our profits to WaterAid,"" says Karen. She adds that Belu forms relationships with restaurateurs who ""buy into our mission"", and whose customers are pleased to see the Belu name because they understand and appreciate the work it does. Karen says that this is better than ""fighting for [supermarket] shelf space, and having to fund promotions to move goods from the shelves"". WaterAid works to prevent people from having to drink unclean water While Belu continues to grow, Karen had to deal with another health scare in 2016. ""Last year was the year from hell. I had breast cancer - thankfully I didn't have chemo, and I kept my hair,"" she says. ""I was exhausted and knackered over the summer, but my team really stepped up."" The cancer was successfully removed, and she says her work was a welcome distraction. ""I clearly needed a few days at home, but when your job is your passion and purpose it keeps you going."" She adds that when she was really exhausted during that difficult time, she would remember that life was still worse for a ""six-year-old walking eight hours a day to collect water"". This made her realise that having to deal with her bad news was ""no big deal"". Belu's partnership with WaterAid also aims to provide safe sanitation To help limit Belu's carbon footprint, Karen encourages her 34-strong workforce to work from home when possible, to remove the need to commute. She herself lives in rural Warwickshire, and usually goes into the office in London only two or three days a week. ""The rule is not to go into the office when you can work at home."" Ryan Doherty, an industry analyst at research group IbisWorld, says that Belu has ""garnered a reputation as one of the leading eco-friendly brands among bottled water producers"". He adds: ""Its targeting of the hospitality sector and its innovative approach to reducing the environmental impact of its products has driven demand from clients eager to improve their image through corporate sustainability."" When not leading Belu, which bottles in water in Shropshire, Karen spares the time to help young start-ups who also want to achieve positive social change. She recently took part in a panel discussion for the Chivas Venture, a competition for aspiring social entrepreneurs organised by whisky brand Chivas Regal. Karen works to help young social entrepreneurs ""I love this part of my job,"" says Karen, who is married with two children. ""It reminds me that I'm not a complete disaster, and reminds me of the progress we have made."" She adds that she is keen to educate people about the reality of running a not-for-profit business. ""Launching and running a social enterprise is a wonderful, aspirational thing to do. It's using your skills to do something amazing, but in reality it's harder than you think.""

LiveCounty Championship - Lancs struggle to break Essex resistance,"Essex's Lawrence makes 141* to save game Lawrence shares century stands with Westley & Ten Doeschate Jarvis takes three wickets for Lancs Surrey beat Warwickshire by innings & one run Wins for Notts, Kent, Hants & Northants Gary Smee That's your lot for the opening round of the 2017 County Championship season. It's certainly been four days of drama with brilliant centuries, superb bowling spells and fantastic run chases. Adam Williams and Kalika Mehta will be here on Good Friday (14 April) for the next round of fixtures, when a few more sides including Middlesex and Durham get their season under way. Until then, goodbye. Here's a reminder of what's coming up on Good Friday when reigning champions Middlesex start their 2017 campaign at Hampshire... Division One: Hampshire v Middlesex Somerset v Essex Surrey v Lancashire Warwickshire v Yorkshire Division Two: Derbyshire v Northants Durham v Notts Glamorgan v Worcestershire Gloucestershire v Leicestershire Sussex v Kent Essex draw with Lancashire Dan Lawrence strides off to a standing ovation from the Chelmsford crowd. The 19-year-old batted for 333 balls, and more than seven hours for his unbeaten 141. Essex batted for more than four sessions to save the game with Tom Westley and captain Ryan ten Doeschate also making useful contributions. Essex 159 & 316-6 draw with Lancashire 319 & 317-3 dec That's it, both sets of players are shaking hands. Essex have batted out the day to secure the draw. Essex 159 & 316-6 v Lancashire 319 & 317-3 dec This should be the last over now. All the praise will be rightly heaped on Dan Lawrence, but don't forget Tom Westley and Ryan ten Doeschate who both shared hundred partnerships with him. Essex 159 & 312-6 v Lancashire 319 & 317-3 dec Easy as you like for Essex. Just the single off Kyle Jarvis' over to move Dan Lawrence up to 140. A simply sensational innings from the 19-year-old. Essex 159 & 311-6 v Lancashire 319 & 317-3 dec Another over played out without too much trouble by Simon Harmer off Liam Livingstone, including a second boundary for the South African. A minimum of three overs to go, or about 10 minutes. It's all feeling fairly academic at the moment. Essex 159 & 307-6 v Lancashire 319 & 317-3 dec Simon Harmer is okay and sees out the remaining couple of balls from Kyle Jarvis. Four overs left. Essex 159 & 306-6 v Lancashire 319 & 317-3 dec Simon Harmer is hit on the hand by Kyle Jarvis, after hitting him for four, and out comes the physio. I'm not sure it's all that serious, but crucially wasting a few more seconds for Essex. There are a minimum of 4.2 overs to go, or about 15 minutes if they get through those. Essex 159 & 302-6 v Lancashire 319 & 317-3 dec Liam Livingstone replaces Stephen Parry and ALMOST gets through. The ball keeps low and skids just past Dan Lawrence's stumps. Was that Lancashire's last chance? Essex 159 & 302-6 v Lancashire 319 & 317-3 dec Yep, it's pretty gloomy out there at the moment.Â Simon Harmer does the job for Essex though, seeing out an over from Kyle Jarvis. He's faced 15 balls without scoring, not that it matters. Six to go. Essex 159 & 302-6 v Lancashire 319 & 317-3 dec Dan Lawrence plays out a maiden to the spin of Stephen Parry. The floodlights are on at Chelmsford, conditions aren't easy for batting, but Lancashire are running out of time. Essex 159 & 301-6 v Lancashire 319 & 317-3 dec Ryan ten Doeschate appeared furious when he got out, but I think it was more disappointment than a bad decision. It's all down to young Dan Lawrence and the lower order. Essex 159 & 301-6 v Lancashire 319 & 317-3 dec Dan Lawrence still looks like he's having a net out there.Â 54 more balls for Essex to survive, Lancashire need four wickets. Essex 159 & 300-6 v Lancashire 319 & 317-3 dec Simon Harmer, who has a first-class hundred, is the new man in at eight for Essex. Lancashire are buoyant. The oohs and aahhs after every delivery can be heard once again. Essex 159 & 300-6 v Lancashire 319 & 317-3 dec I told you Kyle Jarvis never gives up! Ryan ten Doeschateis pinned bang in front and up goes the finger. Lancashire still have a glimmer of hope. Essex 159 & 298-5 v Lancashire 319 & 317-3 dec Kyle Jarvis is still giving it his all for Lancashire.Â The skiddy seamer always will, he's a determined fella. But still no way through with about 40 minutes to go. Essex 159 & 298-5 v Lancashire 319 & 317-3 dec That Dan Lawrence cover drive also brought up the 100 partnership with Essex captain Ryan ten Doeschate. You won't see many better under the pressure to save a game. Essex 159 & 298-5 v Lancashire 319 & 317-3 dec Another glorious shot from Dan Lawrence. He strokes Stephen Parry through the covers for his 18th boundary and moves to 136. It's an absolute masterclass from the Essex batsman who has now faced exactly 300 balls. Essex 159 & 294-5 v Lancashire 319 & 317-3 dec It's thirsty work for Dan Lawrence. The 19-year-old has been in the middle for more than six hours playing the innings of his life. Fifty more minutes to survive my friend. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Microdosing: The people taking LSD with breakfast,"This video can not be played Simpa says microdosing helps to alleviate his mental health problems There is a small community of people in the UK who ""microdose"" - or take small amounts of psychedelic drugs as part of their daily lives. They say it boosts creativity and can have medicinal benefits, despite a lack of scientific research. On a table in his house in Durham, Simpa shows me a tab of LSD he has cut into about 10 pieces. The whole thing would be enough for a trip he says, but today he's taking just a tiny dose of it. On the days he does this, Simpa says it's just part of his morning routine. ""I take it with a cup of tea, my toast and my vitamins,"" he tells theBBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme. Simpa's tab of LSD In another part of the UK, ""Dylan"" - whose name we have changed - is going through a similar ritual with some magic mushrooms, weighing out a tiny dose and eating it with his cup of tea. Some people use microdosing simply to ""improve their day"", others to enhance their creativity and some use it in a therapeutic manner - arguing it helps with their mental health problems. Watch Catrin Nye'sfull film on microdosing here,external. Both LSD and magic mushrooms, the drugs most commonly used to microdose, are illegal Class A drugs carrying a maximum sentence of seven years in prison for possession. A small number of people we spoke to had tried it with MDMA, also a Class A drug. Dylan says the law is not much of a deterrent for him. He argues he is ""not hurting anyone or creating a trail of devastation by doing this"". He has a very ordinary, respectable job. The fact that he goes to work having taken illegal drugs is not something his colleagues know, although his friends do. He says the microdoses make him better at his job; more able to concentrate. ""It just gives you that very kind of calm and relaxed sense of being centred,"" he says. Simpa takes LSD with a cup of tea and vitamins in the morning Simpa is one of the people using microdosing for therapeutic purposes. At 28, he is living with quite severe mental health problems - ""depression and anxiety as a result of childhood trauma, that led to borderline personality disorder and PTSD"". He says the prescription medication he has been given results in more side-effects than benefits. ""I've found that these substances, psychedelics, give me the benefits without any of those drawbacks. Me using these substances means I've been able to view my trauma so that it's just an experience, a memory like any other."" Such individual experiences are, of course, anecdotal. There is no scientific proof behind claims of the medicinal benefits of microdosing. James Rucker, a psychiatrist, is one of a number of people carrying out scientific experiments into the potential medical applications of psychedelic drugs. He was recently involved in a trial at Imperial College London looking at the use of magic mushrooms in clinical depression. It did not, however, look at microdosing James Rucker says a lack of research means scientists do not know what the long-term risks of microdosing might be ""Microdosing at a medical level, we know absolutely nothing about,"" he explains. ""The only way that we can sort out whether or not it works is by doing a blinded, placebo-controlled randomised trial."" He says the dangers of people self-medicating like this are currently completely unknown, and that is where the problem lies. ""The definition of a microdose is that you don't notice the subjective effect, but that doesn't mean it's not having any effect on youâ¬. ""We don't know what the risks in the long term might be. ""There was some concern before 1970 - when the drugs were being used clinically - that in people who were liable to develop schizophrenia and psychotic disorders, the drugs might actually uncover those problems in some people. ""Some studies showed that that might be a risk, some studies showed that it wasn't. So again, it's another area where we don't know."" Those who microdose, however, argue its benefits go beyond alleviating mental health issues. In Silicon Valley in the US, home to thousands of start-up businesses and some of the world's largest technology companies, some entrepreneurs have claimed it makes them more creative. Dr James Fadiman, who has been researching psychedelics since the 1960s, runs a website on microdosing where he asks people to report back to him about their experiences. He says more than 900 people have responded so far. ""The most consistent result is people saying, 'My life seems to be working better.' [They are] more effective, their sleeping habits improve, their eating habits improve, they feel better in social situations."" ""Anna"", who lives in the UK, says she has tried microdosing in the past, both with LSD and more recently with magic mushrooms picked from the hills near where she lives with her two children. She says the experience wasn't very dramatic, but on the days she microdosed she felt more productive. ""It's just like having a slightly better quality of life. ""Anna"" used to microdose with both LSD and magic mushrooms ""I would have quite an ordinary day - I just felt quite happy, calm and grounded and I would sleep better."" There is, however, a further danger to microdosing - the risk of taking too much. Psychedelics are very powerful drugs and Dylan admitted accidentally tripping at work when he took too big a microdose. James Rucker says he knows he cannot stop people using drugs recreationally. ""That's something we have to work with,"" he says. He argues it is all the more reason to conduct research into the effects of these drugs.

Why University Challenge contestants go viral,"Seagull (left) and Monkman have been the stars of the Jeremy Paxman-fronted current series University Challenge is, quite simply, the most fiendishly difficult quiz show on TV. Most of us can just about get a few questions right on Eggheads or The Chase - but few of us would have a chance against Jeremy Paxman. With many of its viewers totally flummoxed by the questions - perhaps it's not surprising that the BBC Two quiz show tends to go viral for other reasons. Namely, the quirks of its contestants. Eric Monkman and Bobby Seagull have been the breakout stars of the current series (more on them in a minute), but they're far from the first to find fame on the show. The invention of social media has given the programme a new lease of life and helped many contestants develop their own cult following. Gail Trimble (second right) became a viewer favourite in 2009 ""University Challenge works extremely well for this YouTube generation,"" says Tom Eames, senior TV reporter at Digital Spy. ""One funny moment or question can be so easily shared on Twitter now - it's the same when something rude happens on Countdown or someone makes a fool of themselves on Pointless."" Eames thinks another reason the show has found a new audience is how much more fashionable it has become to be super-smart. ""In the last few years, everyone loves calling themselves a geek or a nerd, even though in the real world they might not be,"" he says. ""Shows like The Big Bang Theory have recently flourished. So when someone genuinely seems to have some geeky superpowers like Monkman, we like to big them up."" Ahead of this season's final on Monday evening, let's take a look back at a few of University Challenge's viral sensations: Monkman and Seagull finally came head-to-head at the semi-final The current series saw two contestants - both captains of rival teams from Cambridge University - find social media fame. As a show which normally features a lot of upper class English voices, Seagull's east London accent caught the attention of viewers, as did his wonderful surname. Monkman, meanwhile,inspireda legion of online fans who identified themselves with the hashtag #monkmania. His facial expressions and tendency to deliver answers with an upward inflection won him a place in the hearts of many viewers. He and Seagull each went viral in their own right before they finally faced each other on screen in the semi-final, where Monkman narrowly edged victory. Monkman and Seagull have become friends since appearing on the show ""I would say Monkman is in the all time top five [contestants],"" The Independent's James Rampton told the BBC. ""There's a tendency in our culture to be very homogeneous, everyone must be cool, be good looking. But Monkman, I hope he wouldn't mind me saying, is a bit of a geek."" Monkman and Seagull, it later transpired, were friends off-air and caught the train down to London together when they appeared on The One Show last month. At this point we'd usually demand they be given their own TV show - but we're pretty sure we'd never understand anything they were saying. Gail Trimble went viral in 2009 after her appearance on the show One of the most memorable University Challenge contestants of recent years was Gail Trimble, of Corpus Christi, Oxford. She answered around two thirds of the questions on her own, winning more points than all three of her teammates combined. Her performances quickly caught the attention of viewers, with many suggesting she was the smartest-ever contestant. She was particularly popular with a certain genre of men's magazines, who at one point asked whether she would ever consider a career change. ""My brother received a Facebook message from Nuts, saying 'Can we have your sister's email address, we want her to do a tasteful shoot,'"" Trimble told BBC Breakfast. ""So he sent them a reply saying 'Seriously mate, would you send your sister's contact details to Nuts?'"" The name might not ring a bell - but Ralph Morley was the bravest contestant of them all: the man who spoke back to Jeremy Paxman. Here's how theglorious exchange,externalwent: Paxman:""During the 20th Century, who held the position of prime minister of the United Kingdom for the..."" Morley:[Buzzing in] ""Margaret Thatcher."" Paxman:[Looking shocked] ""How did you know I was going to ask for the longest period of time?"" Morley:""Well what else was it going to be?"" Audience:""Ooooooh!"" Paxman:""Okay well let's see if you get these bonuses right. They're on French land borders, you smart arses."" We salute you, Ralph. In 2015, Oscar Powell of Peterhouse, Cambridge took the concept of facial expressions to a whole new level. The geological sciences student, who looks a little bit like Michael Gove, had one of the most animated human faces in the history of human faces. If he was struggling to answer a question, his jaw would drop, his face would scrunch up or his tongue would poke out as he tried to arrive at the answer. After huge reaction on social media, Powelltweeted,external: ""Yes, I know I'm odd."" But his fanbase continued to revel in his performances and declare their love for him. Eames says: ""It used to be rare for normal people to become famous off the back of a TV show, but the line between celebrity and non-celebrity is so blurred now. ""Ten years ago, someone could appear on the programme but be forgotten again the next day, but that's not the case anymore. ""As a result, people who appear on shows like this fall under the celebrity bracket, so there's a potential for them to become fair game to viewers."" Stephen Fry, Miriam Margolyes and David Starkey all appeared on University Challenge Long before they were famous, some of Britain's most distinguished brains made their first TV appearances on University Challenge. Downton Abbey creator Julian Fellowes, historian David Starkey, and general national treasure Stephen Fry are among the quiz show's alumni. Actress Miriam Margolyes even claims her appearance on the programme in 1963 marked the first time anybody had ever said the f-word on TV. In 2011, she told Graham Norton: ""I got a question wrong, and I [swore], and they bleeped me out so you saw my face [saying the word], but nothing actually came out."" Had Twitter been around in the 1960s, we're pretty sure that would've gone viral. Follow us onFacebook,external, on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external, or on Instagram atbbcnewsents,external.

Eta's violent campaign ends with hardly a whisper,"Eta still exists even though it has now closed an important chapter of its history In the final days before the Basque separatist group Eta gave up its guns, mediators spoke of  ""jitters"" over whether this long-awaited moment would go according to plan. And as we drove into San Sebastian, in the heart of Spain's Basque region, we were halted by road blocks and stern faced police in black uniforms, guns pressed against their chests. For a moment it felt like days of old when this picturesque town was an epicentre of Eta's bloody campaign for independence. But then cyclists sped past, in a blaze of bright colours, in the warm spring sunshine. It was the Tour of the Basque Country. The traffic jam also held up one of the mediators' Eta contacts for more than a hour. Decades ago, when Spanish and French security forces were locked in a brutal confrontation with Eta fighters, his delay would have been a cause for concern. Irish Methodist preacher Harold Good has played a key role in the peace process Pressure from within Basque society had been instrumental in sketching a new future for a region where there's still a strong yearning for independence But on Saturday morning, just after sunrise, a dark chapter came to an end in a short simple ceremony in Bayonne City Hall in south-west France. As the world confronts a new wave of extreme Islamist violence, the last insurgency in the heart of Europe has effectively ended. Eta's move was largely symbolic since much of its arsenal is obsolete. But symbolism matters in a conflict which has left a deep wound, particularly in Spanish society. I and two other journalists were allowed to sit in on the ceremony. In a statement handed to me through an intermediary two days before, the ""Basque Socialist Revolutionary Organisation for National Liberation"" announced their ""Disarmament Day"". Like so much about this moment, it was a study in contrasts. Shafts of sunlight streamed through the heavy drapes drawn across long windows in an elegant high ceilinged room. History was made around a small square table which brought together international mediators who had worked toward this day for many years, along with members of an association called ""Artisans of Peace"". This video can not be played Ram Manikkalingam  played a key role in mediating the ceasefire ""Very significant"" quantities of explosive materials have been handed over by Eta to the authorities Anger and antagonism over a half a century of Eta car bombings and assassinations haven't gone away Pressure from within Basque society had been instrumental in sketching a new future for a region where there is still a strong yearning for independence. But anger and antagonism over a half a century of Eta car bombings and assassinations haven't gone away either. The Spanish and French governments still refuse to negotiate with a proscribed terrorist group. Eta tried for years to open a secret channel. Sources say that in the past year there were high-level contacts with senior French officials. Spain blocked them on at least three occasions. So unlike in Northern Ireland and Colombia, where governments played a role, Eta's disarmament came about through a unique collaboration between international organisations and an array of civil society actors ranging from churches to trade unions. Eta had warned in their statement, with palpable bitterness, that ""enemies of peace"" could attack their event. But, on the day, Spanish authorities ""looked the other way"", and the French ""actively looked the other way"", in the words of one of the international organisers. French forces discreetly secured Bayonne City Hall on a quiet Saturday morning. It fell to French Basque environmentalist, Txetx Etcheverry, dressed in casual attire, to hand over a black dossier bulging with blue files. Eta's announcement was followed by a mass demonstration in favour of peace This was Eta's inventory with details of their remaining weaponry including locations of their last arms dumps which are all in France. The file then rested for a moment in the hands of two leading men of the cloth: Archbishop Matteo Zuppi of Bologna and The Reverend Harold Good from Northern Ireland who had also witnessed the IRA's weapons decommissioning more than a decade ago. From where I sat, I could see there was text and photographs about what was later described as ""very significant"" quantities of explosive materials - nearly three tons worth - and about 120 guns. The white bearded Reverend Good, who's been visiting this region since 2005, later told me it was a ""wonderful day"". And then, the documents were passed to Ram Manikkalingam, a mediator who decided the occasion merited a suit and tie, who heads the Amsterdam-based Dialogue Advisory Group. ""There were many moments when we doubted this would happen,"" he admitted when we sat down in the same room after he had deposited Eta's file in the French prosecutor's office in City hall. This video can not be played Eta killed hundreds of people over 40 years ""There were steps forward, and steps backward,"" recalls Mr Manikkalingam who, as chair of the International Verification Commission, has also been monitoring Eta's unilateral ceasefire declared in 2011. It has taken since then to convince Eta fighters to give up their weaponry without getting anything in return. Tracking down what's left also took time in a highly secretive organisation with a myriad of small cells. And not everyone is on board. Sources estimate Eta dissidents include about 100 hardline fighters, including prisoners and their family members and gunmen still underground. ""This worried us constantly,"" admits Mr Manikkalingam. ""As we know from the Northern Ireland experience, one of the worst bomb attacks took place after the Good Friday Agreement."" Sources say lessons were drawn from IRA history to try to ensure bomb makers are under control, and any signs of dissatisfaction are addressed. And Eta still exists. Hence, the only reaction from Spain's Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy and his governing People's Party (PP) was to call on ""terrorists"" to ""dissolve... and disappear"" but not before apologising to its many victims. ""As a long-time observer - and I never thought I would say this - I have to say that the PP's hardline, 'no talks, this is a law-and-order matter' has worked,"" remarked journalist and historian Giles Tremlett who also sat in on the handover ceremony. ""Eta has been defeated."" From Eta to Stockholm: Is terror more of a threat to Europe than before? Eta disarms: French police find 3.5 tonnes of weapons Rev Harold Good says Eta disarmament 'hugely important' Timeline: Eta campaign What is Eta? But the mood was still buoyant at a packed ""Peace Rally"" in the Old Town of Bayonne. A video on a big screen showed Eta's arms dumps being guarded by volunteers before French police arrived to carry away their contents. ""There are issues which need to be addressed on the road to peace,"" explained Gorku Elejabarrieta of the pro-independence Basque party Sortu, who was still beaming after attending a rally he said gathered people from all parts of society. ""Every victim has to be acknowledged, including more than 300 Eta prisoners,"" he said, ""But we must work on this together."" The day before, I met his party leader, Arnaldo Otegi, who once headed Eta's political wing. It had earned him the nickname ""Gerry Adams"", in another nod to Northern Ireland. ""The armed conflict should have ended earlier,"" he conceded. ""Our society wanted us to take this step earlier and we should have listened. ""Everyone needs to understand it is not easy to convince militants, after many years of armed struggle, to take this step,"" added the prominent politician who played a key role behind the scenes. ""The past finished late but we want a different future."" As ""Disarmament Day"" drew to a close, a video of the handover ceremony was made available. But all the audio was removed. An armed group which first emerged with a very big bang closed this chapter without even a whisper. Is terror threat to Europe greater today?

'Why I'm crowdfunding to adopt an orphan boy',"When Emilie Larter held a five-day-old orphan in her arms, it set her on a journey to becoming a mum. The 25-year-old was volunteering for a children's charity in Uganda when staff received news that a woman had died - leaving behind seven children. The youngest was a baby boy who didn't even have a name. With no-one to take care of him, he was given over to staff at the charity. Emilie, from Leigh Sinton, Worcestershire, became the baby's sole carer and had sleepless nights looking after the boy, who became known as Adam. Now, she is fundraising to help cover the costs of formally adopting the youngster and bringing him back to live in the UK. She has received more than Â£15,000 in donations, with the majority being raised since her story was shared online on Sunday. Emilie held Adam for the first time when he was just five days old She says the response has been ""amazing"" and it takes her on the next step to finally becoming Adam's mum. Emilie told BBC News: ""I've raised far more than I ever thought I would. ""I thought I'd be pestering family and friends, so it's insane but amazing at the same time. ""I'm so grateful. I've been getting messages from people in China, Australia and Germany. ""People have been telling me how inspiring I am and how it's lovely to read something nice. ""But this is just my life."" Emilie became the sole carer for Adam after his biological mum died Emilie's journey started in September 2014 when the charity she was volunteering for in Uganda received a call about a newborn boy in need. They arrived at the burial of a woman who had died because of excessive bleeding after birth. Her children included baby Adam. ""He had not received any breast milk or formula and there was no one able to care for him. His mum left this world before even giving him a name,"" said Emilie. ""We took him in and I became the little one's sole carer. The sleepless nights were down to me, but they were no bother. I felt privileged to do it. ""I didn't do much but never a day went by where I was bored. I could sit and watch him for hours."" Over the next two years, Emily visited Adam as often as she could while working in a teaching job in the UK. But the short visits were not enough and she moved back to Uganda in August 2016 after finding work at an international school. Now Adam, who is two-and-a-half, lives with her full time while she tries to adopt him. Emilie said: ""I feel like his mum already. We had such a strong bond every time I was coming out but especially now since he's been living with me. ""He calls me mum."" Emilie has been living with Adam full time since August Emilie has to foster Adam until August before she can apply to the Ugandan courts to legally become his parent. She will then need to get permission from the UK to bring the little boy back to Britain. She is hopeful that they will be living together in the UK by the end of the year. Emilie said she had planned to fund the adoption herself until she lost her job in December, prompting her to set up aGo Fund Me,externalcrowdfunding page to pay for the process. Her parents help support her living costs and she has taken another teaching position to cover Adam's school fees. Emilie admits becoming a mum at the age of 25 had not been on her agenda, but she doesn't regret the path she has taken. ""It was not in my plan, but for the last two-and-a-half years Uganda is all I've thought about. I'm either talking about it or thinking about it. ""I imagined I wouldn't have kids for another 10 years but I don't regret it. ""It will be amazing to bring Adam home."" Emilie has raised more than Â£15,000 to help adopt Adam While Emilie has received overwhelming support for her decision, some online comments have questioned why she wants to remove Adam from his home country. ""I've been coming back to Uganda for him and I want to continue to do that,"" she said. ""I've done my best to keep him in touch with the village he came from so he can see his neighbours. ""I do my best. But a mother's love is one of the most important things and he's never going to have that here."" Why do we donate money to strangers?

County Championship - Essex pair frustrating Lancs,"Essex's Lawrence makes 141* to save game Lawrence shares century stands with Westley & Ten Doeschate Jarvis takes three wickets for Lancs Surrey beat Warwickshire by innings & one run Wins for Notts, Kent, Hants & Northants Gary Smee That's your lot for the opening round of the 2017 County Championship season. It's certainly been four days of drama with brilliant centuries, superb bowling spells and fantastic run chases. Adam Williams and Kalika Mehta will be here on Good Friday (14 April) for the next round of fixtures, when a few more sides including Middlesex and Durham get their season under way. Until then, goodbye. Here's a reminder of what's coming up on Good Friday when reigning champions Middlesex start their 2017 campaign at Hampshire... Division One: Hampshire v Middlesex Somerset v Essex Surrey v Lancashire Warwickshire v Yorkshire Division Two: Derbyshire v Northants Durham v Notts Glamorgan v Worcestershire Gloucestershire v Leicestershire Sussex v Kent Essex draw with Lancashire Dan Lawrence strides off to a standing ovation from the Chelmsford crowd. The 19-year-old batted for 333 balls, and more than seven hours for his unbeaten 141. Essex batted for more than four sessions to save the game with Tom Westley and captain Ryan ten Doeschate also making useful contributions. Essex 159 & 316-6 draw with Lancashire 319 & 317-3 dec That's it, both sets of players are shaking hands. Essex have batted out the day to secure the draw. Essex 159 & 316-6 v Lancashire 319 & 317-3 dec This should be the last over now. All the praise will be rightly heaped on Dan Lawrence, but don't forget Tom Westley and Ryan ten Doeschate who both shared hundred partnerships with him. Essex 159 & 312-6 v Lancashire 319 & 317-3 dec Easy as you like for Essex. Just the single off Kyle Jarvis' over to move Dan Lawrence up to 140. A simply sensational innings from the 19-year-old. Essex 159 & 311-6 v Lancashire 319 & 317-3 dec Another over played out without too much trouble by Simon Harmer off Liam Livingstone, including a second boundary for the South African. A minimum of three overs to go, or about 10 minutes. It's all feeling fairly academic at the moment. Essex 159 & 307-6 v Lancashire 319 & 317-3 dec Simon Harmer is okay and sees out the remaining couple of balls from Kyle Jarvis. Four overs left. Essex 159 & 306-6 v Lancashire 319 & 317-3 dec Simon Harmer is hit on the hand by Kyle Jarvis, after hitting him for four, and out comes the physio. I'm not sure it's all that serious, but crucially wasting a few more seconds for Essex. There are a minimum of 4.2 overs to go, or about 15 minutes if they get through those. Essex 159 & 302-6 v Lancashire 319 & 317-3 dec Liam Livingstone replaces Stephen Parry and ALMOST gets through. The ball keeps low and skids just past Dan Lawrence's stumps. Was that Lancashire's last chance? Essex 159 & 302-6 v Lancashire 319 & 317-3 dec Yep, it's pretty gloomy out there at the moment.Â Simon Harmer does the job for Essex though, seeing out an over from Kyle Jarvis. He's faced 15 balls without scoring, not that it matters. Six to go. Essex 159 & 302-6 v Lancashire 319 & 317-3 dec Dan Lawrence plays out a maiden to the spin of Stephen Parry. The floodlights are on at Chelmsford, conditions aren't easy for batting, but Lancashire are running out of time. Essex 159 & 301-6 v Lancashire 319 & 317-3 dec Ryan ten Doeschate appeared furious when he got out, but I think it was more disappointment than a bad decision. It's all down to young Dan Lawrence and the lower order. Essex 159 & 301-6 v Lancashire 319 & 317-3 dec Dan Lawrence still looks like he's having a net out there.Â 54 more balls for Essex to survive, Lancashire need four wickets. Essex 159 & 300-6 v Lancashire 319 & 317-3 dec Simon Harmer, who has a first-class hundred, is the new man in at eight for Essex. Lancashire are buoyant. The oohs and aahhs after every delivery can be heard once again. Essex 159 & 300-6 v Lancashire 319 & 317-3 dec I told you Kyle Jarvis never gives up! Ryan ten Doeschateis pinned bang in front and up goes the finger. Lancashire still have a glimmer of hope. Essex 159 & 298-5 v Lancashire 319 & 317-3 dec Kyle Jarvis is still giving it his all for Lancashire.Â The skiddy seamer always will, he's a determined fella. But still no way through with about 40 minutes to go. Essex 159 & 298-5 v Lancashire 319 & 317-3 dec That Dan Lawrence cover drive also brought up the 100 partnership with Essex captain Ryan ten Doeschate. You won't see many better under the pressure to save a game. Essex 159 & 298-5 v Lancashire 319 & 317-3 dec Another glorious shot from Dan Lawrence. He strokes Stephen Parry through the covers for his 18th boundary and moves to 136. It's an absolute masterclass from the Essex batsman who has now faced exactly 300 balls. Essex 159 & 294-5 v Lancashire 319 & 317-3 dec It's thirsty work for Dan Lawrence. The 19-year-old has been in the middle for more than six hours playing the innings of his life. Fifty more minutes to survive my friend. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Evans trails to dampen Crucible hopes,"Reanne Evans was looking to become the first woman to reach the main draw of the World Championship Reanne Evans said she was ""gutted"" to lose a marathon World Championship second qualifying round tie to Lee Walker. The 11-time women's world champion fought back from 6-1 down to 9-6 before Welshman Walker sealed it. ""I was in control of most of the frames,"" Evans told BBC Sport. ""I think I should have won every frame in the second session. ""It was 3-3 and it should have been 6-0 easily."" See the qualifying draw and results in full,external Evans, bidding to become the first woman to reach the main draw, was five behind when the match resumed on Monday, but only six shared frames were possible until the afternoon session was timed out. When the pair returned in the evening, Evans clawed two more back only for Walker to move within one round of the main draw at the Crucible. ""I think if I'd have pulled one more back I'd have been the favourite,"" added Evans, who beat Robin Hill in the first qualifying round. ""The buzz off winning that was immense and I couldn't wait to play again. Maybe if it was a day later I'd have been more on the ball. I still felt really good out there."" Evans will not be eligible to qualify for the 2018 World Championship because the 2017 women's event was won by Hong Kong's Ng On Yee. ""Being in this environment make you want to play,"" said Evans. ""Hopefully I'll get to play in them a lot more. At least I know I can compete, even if I'm not playing at my best."" Former world champion Peter Ebdon is also through to the final qualifying round after a 10-9 win over Jack Lisowski. Another former champion, Mark Williams, scraped through by the same scoreline against Liam Highfield. However, 1997 winner Ken Doherty was beaten 10-4 by Ben Woollaston and will lose his tour card for next season.

His name was Henry Summers - but who was he?,"Harry (on the left) with workmates at George Brown & Sons When I heard the story of an elderly man who had lain undiscovered in his flat for three years I wanted to know more about who he was. It began with an urban horror story. In June 2015 police in Edinburgh were called by a GP because an elderly patient named Henry Summers had not been seen for several years. The police went to Henry's address in Leith, one of the most densely populated areas in Scotland. Henry lived in a top-floor flat in Leith They went to the door of his top-floor flat on Easter Road and knocked but got no answer. The police called a locksmith but he couldn't open the door because the hinges had fused as it hadn't been opened for years. When the police knocked the door down they found a mountain of mail in the hall andHenry Summers was inside, dead. He had been dead for three years, undiscovered, because all of his bills were paid by direct debit. Police beat down the door to gain entry to Henry's flat A few years before that a woman had been found dead in Edinburgh, undiscovered for five years.,external The media were full of recrimination and finger pointing. I used to work with old people and had seen this before. It's easy to de-personalise older people. We talk about parents and pensioners as if they are conversation-starters about social issues. But the way someone dies isn't a summary of their whole life. A year after his body was found, I wanted to find out who Henry Summers had been during his 80-something years of life. My detective work was for a BBC Radio Scotland documentary and it began with the reports of the incident in the local papers. Journalist John Connell had interviewed neighbours at the time the body was discovered. Denise Mina started her investigations at the home where Henry was found They told him they had last seen Mr Summers three years earlier in 2012. They saw him being stretchered out of his house into an ambulance. He was wearing an oxygen mask and looked very grey. The neighbours didn't know that Henry had been discharged and returned to his home. The nameplate on Henry's front door Later, one of the neighbours knocked on the door. He opened Henry's letterbox and smelled what he assumed was food going bad. They said Henry kept himself to himself but was very dapper, always wore a blue jacket and a flat cap and he used to whistle as he was coming up the stairs. Then a twist: a man came forward and said that the man found dead in the flat in Easter Road could not possibly be Henry Summers. Henry Summers of Easter Road was his father and had died and been cremated in 2012. My Henry was 10 years younger than the man's father. This meant that two men with the exact same name had lived in the same street and died in the same year. It sounds like an unfathomable coincidence - but it wasn't. Later, once we knew who Henry was, it would make perfect sense. Henry lived at 300 Easter Road in Leith I went to Easter Road and asked in the local cafÃ©, the pub, newsagents. The police wouldn't release a photo of Henry so it was difficult to know if they were remembering our Henry. Some people thought they'd seen him but he was variously reported as being in his 60s and his 90s. Some said he stood at the bus stop every morning, caught the number 35 and then came back on it in the afternoon. He bought milk and newspapers every day too but the shopkeepers had changed in the three years since he was last seen. He was a difficult man to find. I had assumed that Henry had been forgotten and would have been buried by the city council. Public health funerals often happen when a person has died alone and impoverished. I was completely wrong. In fact, Henry's funeral had been organised and paid for and an obituary had been printed in the paper. I wrote, via the crematorium, to the person who paid for the funeral but they wanted to remain anonymous. I also assumed that Henry's flat was rented, perhaps the landlord would know him, but Henry owned his flat outright. He had bought it in 1970 and paid his mortgage off completely in just four years. It was Â£1,500. Where on earth did he get that money from? Was he from a rich family? I was stuck so I went on BBC Radio Scotland's Kaye Adams programme to ask for information. The documentary team were contacted on Facebook by people who thought they had seen a man matching his description in the Ocean Terminal Shopping Centre. He was there regularly, reading the paper, quite content, they said. The number 35 stops there so it seemed credible. In the meantime, I tried to trace the person who inherited Henry's flat. In Scotland, any property left intestate is dealt with by the National Ultimus Haeres Unit. DEATHS REPORTED 01 JULY 2015 SUMMERS, Henry, d.o.b: 16/03/1929: place of birth: Leith, who resided at Flat 3F3, 300 Easter Road, Edinburgh , EH6 8JT and who died at Flat 3F3, 300 Easter Road, Edinburgh , EH6 8JT, on 24/06/2015. NUHU/113/15 - POSSIBLE RELATIVES TRACED They list unclaimed property online so that any claims can be filed. Henry's flat had been claimed but they couldn't tell us who the beneficiary was. I contacted expert genealogist Dr Bruce Durie and using the Land Register and the census he solved the mystery of the two Henrys. Our Henry was born in 1929 and had lived and worked in Leith all of his life. He was an only child and lived with his parents, nursing his fragile mum until her death. After that he moved from a flat in Thorntree Street just round the corner to the flat in Easter Road. Henry was said to have taken the 35 bus from his home to Ocean Terminal in Leith Here was the answer: Henry's dad, one of nine children, was brought up at several addresses in Couper Street, Leith. This street was populated almost entirely by households by the name of Summers. Most of those families, probably relations, had children named Henry. The name 'Henry Summers' was as much a part of Leith as rope and drink. The only reason I didn't know that was that Leith has changed so much over the past 40 years. It is gentrified now, the docks have shut, the demographics changed and the vast Summers family have mostly left. My Henry was a ships' carpenter, according to his death certificate. This was an extremely skilled job with a long apprenticeship. Henry's family were labourers, so he had done well for himself. They must have been very proud of him. The mystery of the mortgage remained. Maritime historian Dr Eric Graham speculated that Henry might have been a whaler or worked long haul. Those ships would go around the world for months at a time and ships' carpenters could be paid a lump sum at the end of the voyage. It was all guesswork but then our original radio programme was broadcast and suddenly Henry came alive again. His old pals heard it and contacted us, or the newspapers carrying stories about him. He wasn't even known as Henry, everyone called him Harry. Harry, it turned out, was a great laugh. He was a Hibs fan, a brilliant carpenter and an angler. His old gaffer told us Harry was plagued by a mysteriously intermittent case of lumbago, which only ever flared up when he couldn't be bothered doing a particular job. His work pal, Andy, contacted us. Harry (on the left) with workmates at George Brown & Sons They worked together at George Brown's in Leith all the way through the 1970s. Andy saw the obit in the paper and went to Harry's funeral. He said Harry was a gent. In the 1940s and 1950s, when Harry first started work, men in the high trades would wear a shirt and tie underneath their overalls. Harry still did this in the mid-90s. Henry worked at George Brown and Sons in Leith We heard that Harry was a good guy who didn't like sexist jokes, which was unusual in the docks in the 70s. Another old work pal, Robert, remembered that Harry would pop in to see the guys after he retired to regale them with his latest adventures. Harry was a confirmed bachelor, an only son and came across as bit of a mummy's boy, in a really nice way. He was teetotaller when Robert knew him but their gaffer, Fred, told stories about Harry's wilder days when they would all laugh and Harry would laugh along with them. Fred was a whaler and Robert never heard them speaking about whaling together, so he thought Harry probably hadn't done that. He didn't think he had ever been abroad. Assistant manager at George Brown and Sons, Steve McIntosh, knew him well. Harry had retired in the late 90s and loved river fishing for trout. He was off every weekend to the Tweed and Dalkeith. Harry didn't like drydocking the boats in winter or the rain, Steve said. If Harry knew a boat was coming in and the weather was rotten, he'd call in sick with lumbago, an unusual condition for someone as active as Harry. Very unusual in avid river fishermen. Steve said they wouldn't tell Harry the boat was coming in but Harry would have his revenge: if he knew they'd tricked him he'd call in sick the next day. Despite this Harry was worth keeping on because he was so good at his job, extraordinarily skilled and meticulous. It emerged that as well as the shipyard, he had been part of a team who ""re-roped"" the stage sets at the Churchill and Playhouse theatres in Edinburgh. When Harry retired he used his bus pass to go anywhere - Galashiels, Berwick, Kirkcaldy. The last time Robert saw Harry was in the St James shopping centre in Edinburgh city centre. He was fit and active going for a bus. Robert asked him where he was going and Harry said he didn't know. Harry in the back row of Rona's exercise class (wearing a red T-shirt) He was going to jump on any bus and that would be his destination for the day. Harry's physiotherapist got in touch. Rona ran an exercise group for people with heart conditions and Harry always stood at the back with the other guys. They all started at the same time. The group would go for an annual day out at the Botanic Gardens and she also remembers Harry at their Christmas Ceilidh. Henry (back left) on a trip to the Botanics with Rona's fitness club When he stopped coming they were worried about him but Rona bumped into him and he explained he was having trouble with sore feet. He never returned to the class but was spotted out and about, on the bus and at the bookies. At the physio class Harry and another man would swap stories about the bookies, how lucky or unlucky they had been. The mystery of the mortgage remained until we heard this. Harry was a gambler. Maybe Harry just got lucky. His Name was Henry will be broadcast on BBC Radio Scotland at 13:30 on Wednesday and will beavailable on the iplayer.

Eta's violent campaign ends without hardly a whisper,"Eta still exists even though it has now closed an important chapter of its history In the final days before the Basque separatist group Eta gave up its guns, mediators spoke of  ""jitters"" over whether this long-awaited moment would go according to plan. And as we drove into San Sebastian, in the heart of Spain's Basque region, we were halted by road blocks and stern faced police in black uniforms, guns pressed against their chests. For a moment it felt like days of old when this picturesque town was an epicentre of Eta's bloody campaign for independence. But then cyclists sped past, in a blaze of bright colours, in the warm spring sunshine. It was the Tour of the Basque Country. The traffic jam also held up one of the mediators' Eta contacts for more than a hour. Decades ago, when Spanish and French security forces were locked in a brutal confrontation with Eta fighters, his delay would have been a cause for concern. Irish Methodist preacher Harold Good has played a key role in the peace process Pressure from within Basque society had been instrumental in sketching a new future for a region where there's still a strong yearning for independence But on Saturday morning, just after sunrise, a dark chapter came to an end in a short simple ceremony in Bayonne City Hall in south-west France. As the world confronts a new wave of extreme Islamist violence, the last insurgency in the heart of Europe has effectively ended. Eta's move was largely symbolic since much of its arsenal is obsolete. But symbolism matters in a conflict which has left a deep wound, particularly in Spanish society. I and two other journalists were allowed to sit in on the ceremony. In a statement handed to me through an intermediary two days before, the ""Basque Socialist Revolutionary Organisation for National Liberation"" announced their ""Disarmament Day"". Like so much about this moment, it was a study in contrasts. Shafts of sunlight streamed through the heavy drapes drawn across long windows in an elegant high ceilinged room. History was made around a small square table which brought together international mediators who had worked toward this day for many years, along with members of an association called ""Artisans of Peace"". This video can not be played Ram Manikkalingam  played a key role in mediating the ceasefire ""Very significant"" quantities of explosive materials have been handed over by Eta to the authorities Anger and antagonism over a half a century of Eta car bombings and assassinations haven't gone away Pressure from within Basque society had been instrumental in sketching a new future for a region where there is still a strong yearning for independence. But anger and antagonism over a half a century of Eta car bombings and assassinations haven't gone away either. The Spanish and French governments still refuse to negotiate with a proscribed terrorist group. Eta tried for years to open a secret channel. Sources say that in the past year there were high-level contacts with senior French officials. Spain blocked them on at least three occasions. So unlike in Northern Ireland and Colombia, where governments played a role, Eta's disarmament came about through a unique collaboration between international organisations and an array of civil society actors ranging from churches to trade unions. Eta had warned in their statement, with palpable bitterness, that ""enemies of peace"" could attack their event. But, on the day, Spanish authorities ""looked the other way"", and the French ""actively looked the other way"", in the words of one of the international organisers. French forces discreetly secured Bayonne City Hall on a quiet Saturday morning. It fell to French Basque environmentalist, Txetx Etcheverry, dressed in casual attire, to hand over a black dossier bulging with blue files. Eta's announcement was followed by a mass demonstration in favour of peace This was Eta's inventory with details of their remaining weaponry including locations of their last arms dumps which are all in France. The file then rested for a moment in the hands of two leading men of the cloth: Archbishop Matteo Zuppi of Bologna and The Reverend Harold Good from Northern Ireland who had also witnessed the IRA's weapons decommissioning more than a decade ago. From where I sat, I could see there was text and photographs about what was later described as ""very significant"" quantities of explosive materials - nearly three tons worth - and about 120 guns. The white bearded Reverend Good, who's been visiting this region since 2005, later told me it was a ""wonderful day"". And then, the documents were passed to Ram Manikkalingam, a mediator who decided the occasion merited a suit and tie, who heads the Amsterdam-based Dialogue Advisory Group. ""There were many moments when we doubted this would happen,"" he admitted when we sat down in the same room after he had deposited Eta's file in the French prosecutor's office in City hall. This video can not be played Eta killed hundreds of people over 40 years ""There were steps forward, and steps backward,"" recalls Mr Manikkalingam who, as chair of the International Verification Commission, has also been monitoring Eta's unilateral ceasefire declared in 2011. It has taken since then to convince Eta fighters to give up their weaponry without getting anything in return. Tracking down what's left also took time in a highly secretive organisation with a myriad of small cells. And not everyone is on board. Sources estimate Eta dissidents include about 100 hardline fighters, including prisoners and their family members and gunmen still underground. ""This worried us constantly,"" admits Mr Manikkalingam. ""As we know from the Northern Ireland experience, one of the worst bomb attacks took place after the Good Friday Agreement."" Sources say lessons were drawn from IRA history to try to ensure bomb makers are under control, and any signs of dissatisfaction are addressed. And Eta still exists. Hence, the only reaction from Spain's Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy and his governing People's Party (PP) was to call on ""terrorists"" to ""dissolve... and disappear"" but not before apologising to its many victims. ""As a long-time observer - and I never thought I would say this - I have to say that the PP's hardline, 'no talks, this is a law-and-order matter' has worked,"" remarked journalist and historian Giles Tremlett who also sat in on the handover ceremony.

Maple producers eye global domination,"Martin Picard looks at a test batch of his maple syrup at his sugar shack Maple syrup isn't just for pancakes anymore, thanks to a group of maple syrup producers in Quebec who are trying to turn a cottage industry into a global empire. Montreal chef Martin Picard says maple syrup runs through the veins of Quebecers like the sap that flows from the trees each spring in sugar bushes across the countryside. In an annual communal gastronomic ritual, Quebecers flock to sugar shacks - casual restaurants where maple syrup is also produced - to fill their plates with pea soup, meat pie, baked beans and crispy pork rinds, all served with ample amounts of maple syrup. ""When we taste the maple syrup we taste all our souvenirs (memories)"" says Picard, who opened a sugar shack nine years ago. It remains one of the toughest reservations to get in the region and was voted one of the top 100 restaurants in Canada. Sap being turned into syrup at the Au Pied de Cochon Sugar Shack He says people who have never tasted the golden syrup might be surprised by its unique flavour, which can have hints of toffee and spice, herbs and flowers. ""But this is the best sugar in the world,"" says Picard. Canada's maple syrup 'rebels' How the Instant Pot cooker developed a cult following The idea that maple syrup could indeed be seen as the world's best sugar is the driving ambition of the Federation of Quebec Maple Syrup Producers. The Federation and its efforts have helped turn a provincial cottage industry into big business. Prior to the 1930s, maple syrup was made mostly in the United States, says Michael Farrell, director of Cornell University's maple syrup research centre. It used to be that every farm in the US northeast and Canada would tap their own sugar maples and produce syrup - some to sell, some to keep. Widespread industrialisation in New England and the rise of cheap white sugar meant that maple production in the US fell into decline. Meanwhile in Canada, production stayed relatively stable, in part because of local governmental support of the industry, Mr Farrell said. But things really took off in the 1990s, about the same time that the Federation got the go-ahead from the Quebec government to start selling their syrup together. The decision by Quebec producers to work collectively, and later to establish the global maple reserve, gave them more market power, said Federation spokeswoman Caroline Cyr. ""Since that time they were able to develop new market, to make an industry of maple syrup,"" she says. ""Before that, it was something they did on the side."" Quebec's maple reserve contains thousands of barrels like this one By the end of the millennium, Canada would be the reigning king of maple syrup, producing about 80% of the world's supply. Over the next two decades, Canadian maple syrup production would triple, largely due to the increasing demand worldwide spurred by the Federation's intense marketing efforts. About 85-90% of all maple syrup produced in Canada comes from Quebec, or about 70% of the world's supply, depending on the year. The Federation controls nearly every aspect of maple production in the province, assigning quotas to the province's 13,500 farmers and selling the syrup to licensed wholesalers. It is a fine-tuned machine, with the Federation backed byprovincial legislation,external. Having a lock on the industry in Quebec has allowed the Federation to establish the strategic maple reserve that contains upwards of 78 million pounds of syrup at a time and allows them to prevent production-based annual price fluctuations. The Federation also sets prices and quotas for the product that all commercial Quebec sugar bush owners must follow. Angele Grenier has been fighting the Federation for years to freely sell her syrup Its executive director Simon Trepanier says control over supply is important given that maple production can swing massively from year-to-year, from ""swimming in a big pool of syrup"" to barely meeting market demand. By establishing prices, the Federation helped boost production not only in Quebec, but in the rest of Canada and the US as well, Farrell says. Maple became a more reliable crop, and that encouraged farmers all over to invest in equipment. Not all Quebec producers support the Federation. Some, like maple producer Angele Grenier, see it as a bureaucratic cartel. Grenier is involved in a long-running legal battle with the Federation over whether she can independently sell her syrup to other provinces. Last year was the Quebec maple industry's biggest year on record, producing more than 11.2m gallons of maple syrup worth more than C$435m (US$327m/Â£262m) total. A large portion of that was shipped abroad in 2016, to places like the UK, Germany, and Japan. UK-based marketing firm Liquid is helping push maple in Britain with ""We Love Maple"", a multi-pronged campaign geared towards getting the product in kitchens across the country. The firm's research suggested that older Britons knew little about the product while younger demographics saw it as ""something big fat Americans put over pancakes at breakfast"", says Elisabeth Lewis-Jones, Liquid's chief executive. They decided to rebrand it instead as a healthy and versatile alternative to white sugar. It is natural and, unlike honey, vegan. It contains minerals like manganese and zinc, unlike trendier sugar alternatives like agave. The campaign began sponsoring two women's soccer teams as part of their health and wellness pitch. The maple campaign has also been courting the country's top chefs, and the Federation is the first foreign organisation to be named an associate member of the Royal Academy of Culinary Art.

""We've been really surprised at how the British public has embraced maple,"" says  Lewis-Jones. Quebec is now ramping up production, adding five million taps in the next two years to meet the growing appetite for the syrup worldwide. The Federation has been spending about C$5m (US$3.7m/Â£3m) a year promoting maple in the UK, India, Japan, and the US. And they are preparing for it to continue growing in global popularity. The Federation wants Quebec to study how much maple could be produced in the province if the trees were tapped to capacity. They believe production could be doubled.
