Priti Patel approves extradition of UK tech tycoon,"Home Secretary Priti Patel has approved the extradition of a British tech tycoon to the US to face criminal fraud charges. The decision comes after Mike Lynch, the founder of Autonomy, lost a multibillion-dollar fraud action in London on Friday. His firm was sold to US giant Hewlett Packard for $11bn (Â£8bn) in 2011. He is accused of manipulating its accounts to inflate the value of the company before its sale. In 2012, just over a year after the purchase, HP announced an $8.8bn write-down (reduction in estimated value) of the value of Autonomy. HP sued Autonomy's founder and former chief financial officer, Sushovan Hussain, for about $5bn, claiming they ""artificially inflated Autonomy's reported revenues, revenue growth and gross margins"". Mr Justice Hildyard said HP had ""substantially won"" its case, more than two years after the start of what was believed to be the UK's biggest civil fraud trial - which was heard over nine months in 2019. But he said the company was likely to receive ""substantially less"" than the amount claimed in damages. Mr Lynch always denied the accusations and said on Friday that he would appeal. His former chief financial officer Mr Hussain was convicted in April 2018 in the US of wire fraud and other crimes related to Autonomy's sale and wasjailed for five years. HP wins multibillion-dollar fraud case over UK firm UK tech giant founder arrested over US extradition Autonomy boss in 'deliberate fraud' The decision in court on Friday coincided with a midnight deadline on the same day for the home secretary to decide whether or not Mr Lynch should be extradited to the US to face criminal trial for 14 counts of conspiracy and fraud. A Home Office spokesperson said: ""Under the Extradition Act 2003, the secretary of state must sign an extradition order if there are no grounds to prohibit the order being made. Extradition requests are only sent to the home secretary once a judge decides it can proceed after considering various aspects of the case. ""On 28 January, following consideration by the courts, the extradition of Dr Michael Lynch to the US was ordered."" Kelwin Nicholls, of law firm Clifford Chance, representing Mr Lynch, said in a statement on Friday evening: ""Dr Lynch firmly denies the charges brought against him in the US and will continue to fight to establish his innocence. ""He is a British citizen who ran a British company in Britain subject to British laws and rules and that is where the matter should be resolved. This is not the end of the battle - far from it."" The lawyer also confirmed that Mr Lynch would file an appeal to the High Court in London. The company was founded in 1996by Mr Lynch out of a specialist software research group called Cambridge Neurodynamics. Autonomy developed software that could extract useful information from ""unstructured"" sources such as phone-calls, emails or video. The software could then do things such as suggest answers to a call-centre operator or monitor TV channels for words or subjects. It gained a listing on the US Nasdaq exchange in May 2000 at the height of the technology boom and was listed in London six months later. The company suffered when the technology bubble burst, dropping out of the FTSE 100 and having to issue a profit warning in 2001. But it grew rapidly and opened joint head offices in Cambridge and San Francisco, with other offices worldwide, to serve 65,000 customer companies. Autonomy was sold to Hewlett Packard for $11bn (Â£8bn) in 2011. Mr Lynch left the company in 2012. Cambridge graduateMr Lynch,external, 56, built Autonomy up to be one of the top 100 UK public companies. In 2006, he was awarded an OBE for services to enterprise. A fellow of the Royal Society, Mr Lynch, who lives in Suffolk, previously advised the government and sat on the boards of the British Library and the BBC.

British 'hitman' guilty of plotting to kill activist,"Muhammad Gohir Khan was offered Â£100,000 to carry out the murder A British ""hitman"" has been found guilty of conspiring to kill a Pakistani dissident in the Netherlands. A court in London heard Muhammad Gohir Khan was offered Â£100,000 (about $134,000) to carry out the murder in Rotterdam last year. However he failed to track his target down, and was arrested on his return to the UK. Now a jury has given a unanimous guilty verdict of conspiracy to murder and he is set be sentenced in March. The intended victim, Waqass Goraya, has told the BBC he is sure the Pakistani intelligence services were ultimately behind the plot and that it forms part of a wider crackdown on dissenting voices both inside and outside Pakistan. Pakistani officials would not comment on the case. Gohir Khan, from east London, had racked up debts of more than Â£200,000 whilst running a cargo company. He was working as a delivery driver for a supermarket, but reacted enthusiastically when he was contacted about a ""job"" in Europe by a contact in Pakistan. Khan was captured on CCTV buying a knife in Rotterdam Khan claimed in court that he initially did not know what the job entailed, but he used fishing analogies in a WhatsApp conversation with a middleman man named as Muzzamil who was to take 20% of the fee. ""Is it a deep sea fish or just tuna?"" Khan asked. Muzzamil, who was also known as ""Papa"" because of his resemblance to cartoon character ""Papa Smurf"", replied, ""just tuna, but not uk tuna, european tuna"". Their grim intent was made clear when Khan discussed needing a ""tool"" or gun for the job, whilst at another point Muzzamil wrote about the target: ""It's not a SHARKâ¦ A little fishâ¦ Little knife / hook / worm with a string is enough."" The man they planned on killing was Waqass Goraya, a prominent social media activist and critic of the Pakistani military and government, living in Rotterdam in the Netherlands. He was abducted and tortured whilst visiting Pakistan in January 2017 by suspected members of the intelligence services, and told the BBC he was convinced they had now attempted to have him killed in Europe. Waqass Goraya says someone has to stand up to the military in Pakistan ""They don't like being called out for enforced disappearances or their torture cells,"" he said, adding: ""It shows their cowardice. They are scared of people talking. People who are unarmed, with nothing but a pen or keyboard. They are more scared of them than the people with guns."" Pakistan's powerful military did not respond to requests for comment, whilst the country's information minister refused to discuss the case. Government officials claim there is no clampdown on freedom of speech in Pakistan and the army denies interfering in politics, but human rights groups have repeatedly raised concerns about a series of violent attacks in Pakistan on journalists and activists who accuse the military of manipulating the country's electoral system. The threat to Pakistani dissidents extends to those outside the country too. Ayesha Siddiqa is an academic who has written extensively about the Pakistani military. In January 2019 she received a visit and letter from police in Britain warning of ""credible information"" that her life was in danger if she travelled back to Pakistan. Ayesha Siddiqa says she has a contract on her head, even though she is in the UK Dr Siddiqa shared the letter with the BBC, and said her own inquiries had led her to find out, ""there was a contract on my head given to some Afghan warlords to be eliminated on return to Pakistanâ¦ if the temperature was raised I could be targeted in the UK as well."" Like Mr Goraya, Dr Siddiqa told the BBC she believed the Pakistani intelligence services were behind the threat. ""I have no one else to suspect."" Three other Pakistanis living in the UK confirmed to the BBC they had contact with the police over the possibility of them being targeted in Britain. One of them, Fazal Khan, is a lawyer whose 14 year-old son Sahibzada Umer Khan was amongst the victims of a massacre at a school in the northern Pakistani city of Peshawar by militants in 2014. Since then, he has filed numerous court petitions involving Pakistan's military authorities, most recently criticising them for their soft treatment of one notorious former militant leader, who was kept under ""house arrest"" before mysteriously escaping. As a result of his activism Mr Khan has faced threats from extremists and, he believes, the security services. In July 2020 Mr Khan survived an assassination attempt in Pakistan and later fled to the UK. Last April, British police warned him of a threat to his life, advising him to maintain a ""low profile"" and not to venture into public places. Fazal Khan is now in the UK, saying he lives in fear of his life for speaking out Mr Khan told the BBC two plainclothes officers gave him an ""emergency police number"" and said, ""you are in our system, if you feel anything abnormal then give us a call and an armoured vehicle will arrive to rescue you"". The officers did not specify the exact nature of the threat, but Mr Khan believes it must be linked to the Pakistani security services, describing being forced to live ""a life of fear"". Others elsewhere in Europe have also been warned by Western intelligence agencies, including Taha Siddiqui, ajournalist who escaped an abduction attempt in Islamabadand now lives in France. Activist says Pakistan tortured him Abducted activist points finger at Pakistan security Where reporters face beatings, threats and death At Kingston Crown Court, the jury heard Gohir Khan and the middleman Muzzamil discussed the possibility of further ""jobs"" after killing Mr Goraya. Waqass Goraya had been told in 2018 of threats to his life by the FBI. In February last year, before Gohir Khan had even travelled to the Netherlands, he was rushed out of his home in Rotterdam by Dutch intelligence agents and taken to a secure location. The operation targeting him at times appeared amateur and poorly organised, with Khan bemoaning delays in the process as ""dysfunctional"". Meanwhile, Khan produced fake doctored receipts and invented a fictional ""crew"" accompanying him in order to try to extract more money for the hit. Testifying in court, Khan, who was at times tearful, came across as a bumbling opportunist, describing for example how he crashed a car in Rotterdam within minutes of renting it as he wasn't used to driving on the right hand side of the road. When attempting to bypass Covid travel restrictions in order to travel to the Netherlands in June 2021, Khan asked a contact to pretend to be his brother living there. On arrival, however, he was questioned by a border official who called the ""brother"" on the phone and asked him how old Khan was in order to verify his identity. Unable to answer, Khan's ""brother"" hung up, and Khan was denied entry to the country. A few days later, Khan made the trip for a second time and was finally able to reach Rotterdam. He purchased a 19-inch knife and staked out what he believed was Mr Goraya's home. However, he soon realised the address he had been provided with was wrong. Muzzamil assured him that his ""boss"" had received a video of Mr Goraya at the address around six months earlier, but unable to locate him Khan returned to London. On leaving Rotterdam he was questioned by a Dutch border force officer about his trip. Struggling for an answer, Khan replied that he had been ""touristing"", leading the officer to refer him to police in Britain. They arrested him and eventually found his message history with Muzzamil. In court, Khan insisted he never planned to go ahead with the murder and simply wanted to extract money from Muzammil, telling police he only bought a knife in Rotterdam to cut bread and fruit with. The prosecution argued he fully intended to carry out the killing and the jury agreed, convicting him of conspiracy to murder. The Pakistan-based ""client"" who had ordered the hit was never named in court, though Muzzamil referred to a ""big boss"" who gave a green light to the operation and who he had worked with for around 20 years. Muzzamil's full identity has not been disclosed either, though he appears to be a British national living in Pakistan. Police officials said the case remains an ""active investigation"" and appealed for anyone with information about Muzammil to contact them. Mr Goraya is urging the UK authorities to further investigate the case and all those involved. ""It should not stop hereâ¦ They have to go after the people who transferred the money, who ordered the hit."" He has no doubt that trail will eventually lead to the same Pakistani intelligence services he accuses of torturing him five years ago. He, along with other campaigners, also want Swedish and Canadian officials to re-open investigations into the deaths of two Baloch dissidents in 2021, both of which were found not to be suspicious. Pakistani rights activist found dead in Toronto Swedish police find body of Pakistani journalist Some activists worry Britain's close diplomatic relationship and co-operation with the Pakistani authorities on counter-terrorism will lead them to play down the significance of the episode. Mr Goraya, however, is determined, not to be silenced. ""Threats and intimidation don't work,"" he told the BBC. ""It makes people resilient. It makes their voice louder.""

"Hospital missed sepsis signs before girl, 4, died","The health board has said it has taken action to ensure medics can see if someone has sepsis Opportunities to save a four-year-old girl dying from sepsis were missed by doctors, according to an inquest. Skyla Whiting, of Blaenavon, Torfaen, became ill with an upset stomach in May 2018 and died days later. Assistant coroner Sarah Le-Fevre at Newport Coroner's Court, said Skyla's death was contributed to by neglect. She recorded a narrative conclusion. Health bosses said action has since been taken to improve the diagnosis of sepsis at Nevill Hall Hospital. The coroner said ""sepsis not only remained undiagnosed but unconsidered,"" and that Skyla died as a result of ""inaction, late diagnosis and late administration of treatment"". The court heard sepsis is a rare condition in children but early treatment, including intravenous antibiotics improves outcomes. A diagnosis of septic shock was only considered in Skyla's case when a senior doctor saw her on a ward round on 14 May, one day after she had been re-admitted to Nevill Hall Hospital and days after being initially seen by a GP. Skyla could have survived sepsis, the coroner said At this point she was taken to the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff, where she was found to be desperately ill and died a day later. The court heard that a senior doctor should have been alerted to Skyla's condition earlier, and that low staffing levels at the hospital led to the lack of an earlier intervention. The coroner said ""there was a failure to recognise the nature and severity of Skyla's illness"". She added: ""On the balance of probability Skyla would have survived with earlier intervention."" Reports written by doctors after Skyla's death found sepsis should have been diagnosed, and that Skyla ""would have been saved"" if actions had been taken. Over the course of the inquest doctors told the court that intravenous antibiotics should have been administered sooner, and if they had the outcome would have been different. Giving evidence earlier, consultant paediatrician Dr Nadeem Syed said actions had been taken by Aneurin Bevan Health Board to prevent incidents like this happening again. He said more training to recognise sepsis in children is being provided, staffing levels have been addressed and improved and a policy on patients reattending has been addressed so medical staff investigate further. A spokesperson for Aneurin Bevan University Health Board said: ""Our thoughts remain with the family of Skyla and we're very sorry for the circumstances surrounding the care she received.Â Skyla Whiting was taken to Nevill Hall Hospital twice where doctors failed to diagnose sepsis ""This matter has been fully investigated by the Health Board in accordance with its Serious Incident protocol. The findings have been fully and openly shared with the family and the senior coroner for Gwent. ""The health board has already undertaken actions to address the issues raised through our investigation, with a strong emphasis on the importance of recognising the symptoms of deteriorating Sepsis patients.""

Irish Sea border checks 'not fit for purpose',"Checks on goods from Great Britain take place at Northern Ireland ports to make sure they comply with EU laws The system for checks on agri-foods at Northern Ireland's sea ports is ""not fit for purpose"", according to an audit carried out by the European Commission. Thedraft report,external, based on examinations in June last year, said the processes did not comply with EU rules. It said the root of the problem was inadequate resources. Under the Brexit deal, certain goods need to be checked when they enter Northern Ireland from Great Britain, which is no longer in the EU. As part of that deal - known as the protocol - Northern Ireland remained aligned with the EU single market for goods as a way to ensure the free movement of trade across the Irish border. Checks on GB goods take place at Northern Ireland ports to make sure they comply with EU laws. A simple guide to the Brexit border problem The commission's audit said the checks could not ""provide sufficient assurances that only compliant animals and goods are permitted to enter the EU SPS (Sanitary and Phytosanitary) area through the designated border control posts in Northern Ireland"". It said the main issue was a lack of resources. The report said the UK government had ""failed to ensure that sufficient resources - human and structural - have been made available to the responsible competent authorities in Northern Ireland"". The recommendations include: Introduction of proper facilities Ensuring the authorities have or have access to a sufficient number of suitably-qualified staff Better information sharing Better systems for checking pets and personal agri-food products Foreign SecretaryLiz Truss met business leaders and politicians in Belfaston Thursday to discuss the protocol. The government has been attempting to renegotiate the agreement which it made with the EU in 2019. Ms Truss said her aim was to find ""a deal that works for everyone"". She has previously said she would like to see ""significant progress"" in talks with the EU by February. Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney spoke with Ms Truss on Friday and said there were ""landing zones"" for a deal. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Unionists are strongly opposed to the Irish Sea border checks because they do not want Northern Ireland to be treated differently to the rest of the UK. Earlier this week, Stormont's Agriculture Minister Edwin Poots took the first step in his bid to halt the checks. Hesubmitted a paper to seek executive approval for the border checks to continue. He has threatened to halt the checks if the paper is blocked from the next meeting of ministers, something which Sinn FÃ©in has vowed it will do. It comes ahead of a legal challenge which argues the checks are controversial and cut across various departments, so would need executive approval. What is the new Northern Ireland Brexit trade deal?

Cameron wanted 'no doubt' over Bloody Sunday apology,"This video can not be played What happened on Bloody Sunday was ""wrong, full stop"", David Cameron tells BBC Talkback's William Crawley David Cameron has said his apology for Bloody Sunday made it clear there was no doubt what happened was wrong. When the Saville Inquiry was released in 2010, he apologised for the ""unjustified and unjustifiable"" deaths. Ahead of the 50th anniversary, the ex-prime minister said that was a ""proper apology"" that left no room for doubt. Thirteen people were shot dead when soldiers opened fire on civil rights demonstrators in Londonderry on 30 January 1972. After reading the Saville Inquiry into the day's events, Mr Cameron considered how he felt about what he had read,he told BBC Talkback's William Crawley. ""It seemed to me that those words [unjustified and unjustifiable] best summed it up,"" he said. ""You couldn't leave any doubt. ""Unjustified and unjustifiable means let's not go on arguing about this, what happened was wrong, full stop, end of and let's make a proper apology. ""Sometimes with these sort of events politicians - and I can be guilty of this - qualify the apology or shade around the edges. ""On this occasion it needed to be absolutely direct and clear."" Mr Cameron madethe remarks in the House of Commonsand said he was unsure how they would be received in Derry. He added: ""I remember watching the news later that day and being very moved by the scenes and understanding how much this had meant to people."" The march on Bloody Sunday was in protest against a new law giving the authorities the power to imprison people without trial Mr Cameron said he understood why the Bloody Sunday families continued to seek justice. ""Obviously one feels incredible sympathy for people who have been through that appalling experience,"" he said. ""Then it's really a double jeopardy, of having your relatives suffer in that and for so long not having a faithful account of what actually happened, and taking so long for the truth to come out and of course you understand why those people want not just the truth but the justice that should follow."" What happened on Bloody Sunday? Bloody Sunday: The victims Meanwhile, Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) MicheÃ¡l Martin has said the events of Bloody Sunday were indelibly imprinted on the minds of families across the island of Ireland. On Sunday he will lay a wreath at a memorial service in Derry - the first serving taoiseach to do so. ""It was a huge turning point in some respects and remains on as an enduring injustice at the heart of the Northern Ireland Troubles,"" Mr Martin toldBBC Radio Foyle. He paid tribute to the ""persistence, dignity, and resilience"" of the Bloody Sunday victims' families, some of whom he will meet privately on Sunday. He added: ""The journey of justice was a long one, but I think it now stands as a monument in itself and an inspiration to others around the world. ""They got the truth, they got a state apology from the British prime minister and they got support from subsequent Irish governments but it went on too long"". Politicians, he added, must learn from the past and save future generations from violence. An anniversary mass was held in St Mary's Church in the city on Friday, at which Bishop Donal McKeown said the people of Derry had shown ""great dignity and courage"" in the intervening 50 years. ""The suffering endured has borne the seed of solidarity and not merely of anger,"" he told those gathered. ""It takes a wise heart to look at the rubble ofÂ what has been shattered inÂ the past and to make it into a foundation for the future."" Internment, Protest and Bloody Sunday,external Peter Taylor Analysis: Bloody Sunday 50 years on On Wednesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson alsopaid tribute to the Bloody Sunday victims' familiesduring Prime Minister's Questions. Mr Johnson described it as ""one of the darkest days in our history"" and said in the run up to the anniversary ""we must learn from the past, reconcile and build a shared and prosperous future"". You can hear David Cameron'sfull interview with William Crawley on Talkback here Guildhall Square was packed for David Cameron's apology on behalf of the state in 2010 Two public inquiries have been carried out into the events of Bloody Sunday. The Widgery Tribunal, which was announced shortly after Bloody Sunday, largely cleared the soldiers and British authorities of blame. The Saville Inquiry, published in 2010, found none of the casualties were posing a threat or doing anything that would justify their shooting. The then Prime Minister David Cameron issued an apology on behalf of the state in the House of Commons, sayingthe killings were ""unjustified and unjustifiable"". Following the publication of the Saville Inquiry, the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) began a murder investigation in 2010. It took a number of years to complete and detectives then submitted their files to the Public Prosecution Service (PPS) towards the end of 2016. Having weighed up 125,000 pages of material, prosecutors said on 14 March they would prosecute a soldier, known only as Soldier F, for the murders of James Wray and William McKinney on Bloody Sunday. Soldier F also faced charges for the attempted murders of Patrick O'Donnell, Joseph Friel, Joe Mahon and Michael Quinn. On 2 July 2021, it was announced Soldier F would not face trial following a decision by the PPS. The PPS said after ""careful consideration"" the decision had been taken due to another recent court ruling which found evidence being relied upon in the prosecutionof Soldier A and Soldier C for the killing of Joe McCannwas inadmissible. This was due to the circumstances in which the evidence was obtained. The decision not to proceed with the case is now the subject of live judicial review proceedings following a legal challenge brought by a brother of one of the Bloody Sunday victims.

Nightclubs and restaurants fear New Year losses,"This video can not be played Covid and hospitality: 'It's difficult to stay glass half-full' Nightclub and hospitality workers have slammed new Covid restrictions announced by the Welsh government. Nightclubs will close in Wales after Boxing Dayand social distancing has been brought back in response to the Omicron variant. First Minister Mark Drakeford said the decision was ""about protecting the health of people who otherwise would be putting themselves in harm's way"". But workers face ""tough financial decisions"" as clubs close for New Year. Q&A: What are the new Covid rules for Wales? What does Omicron mean for Christmas in Wales? A self-employed DJ said the closure of nightclubs will leave him without money that ""helps to keep food on the table and a roof over my head"". Hywel Ricketts, who has worked in Cardiff for 30 years, said it meant he would have to take ""tough financial decisions"" ahead of New Year's Eve. The 47-year-old told the PA news agency: ""On one of the busiest nights of the year, this will have a detrimental effect on my cash flow."" Social distancing will be a requirement again in response to Omicron He added the closures are ""nothing more than the Welsh government trying to be different for the sake of it"". Peter Marks, chairman of the board at Rekom UK, which owns Cardiff nightclub PRYZM among others, described the new measures as ""a virtue-signalling political decision"", adding they were ""not based on any semblance of fact"". A Â£60m support package for businesses affected by the new restrictions has been announced, with more detail still to come on how funds can be claimed. But with more decisions on Covid restrictions expected to be made on Monday, workers are worried about a raft of cancellations and how wages will be paid. Beth Johnson, of the Vulcan nightclub in Merthyr Tydfil, told BBC Radio Wales: ""I just hope that it's going to be just until February. Business owner Enzo Nigro said Potters had suffered from cancellations as companies pulled the plug on Christmas parties ""We've been through this before and been through months and months like this and it's really hard. ""The government have encouraged us to take outBounce Back Loans,external, but don't forget all the people who have to close down now still need to pay everything back. ""It's just a really, really worrying time for businesses."" Barbara Jeffries says she is keeping positive despite the challenges to her business Barbara Jeffries, owner of The Star and The Roof in Bridgend, said it would be ""a different ball game altogether"" after 27 December, but was keeping positive. ""I'm a very optimistic person. We spent the last lockdown actually investing in the business hoping that we can move forward. ""We've been there nearly 30 years, so I really want to stay there and hopefully we can stay there for the next 10 years at least."" Nightclub owners and staff are ""frustrated"", said Michael Kill of the Night Time Industries Association The chief executive of the Night Time Industries Association said it was considering taking legal action against the Welsh government. ""We feel very much like we've been targeted and marginalized in terms of a sector within Wales,"" said Michael Kill. ""The sad part about it is to make an informed policy decisions without evidence and consultation, makes it very, very difficult to stomach for a sector which has been really, really placed in in a very, very fragile situation."" Enzo Nigro, the owner of Potters bar and restaurant in Newport, said the industry needs more guidance Enzo Nigro, the owner of Potters bar and restaurant in Newport, said Mr Drakeford's announcement left him ""on tenterhooks"" about what other restrictions may be announced next week. ""He hasn't really said anything to help us to prepare, apart from the 2m rule. He hasn't said anything about live entertainment, about track and trace or passports, people sitting at a table - nothing."" Will people in Wales change Christmas Day plans? Omicron 'storm' warning prompts nightclub closures NHS bosses 'discourage' Christmas parties Mr Nigro said Potters had suffered from cancellations as companies pulled the plug on Christmas parties, and added the uncertainty was ""not fair"" on businesses like his. Asked if Thursday's decision punishes younger people, Mr Drakeford said: ""If you look at London and you look to see where the most rapid growth has been in the Omicron variant, it has been people in their 20s and 30s. ""I think you could say that we are discriminating in favour of younger people by taking action,"" he said. But he was criticised by Mr Marks for targeting an industry and its young customers. ""This damaging decision targets the very people whose wellbeing is affected the least by Covid-19... these are decisions that have destroyed their education and social lives,"" he said. ""Nightclubs are not the super-spreader hotbeds they are reported to be. ""Once again, nightclubs are the most hit, but the least supported. This has to stop."" Ms Johnson said: ""I think the youngsters that I've spoken to are absolutely devastated, because they've been encouraged by the government to have these two jabs. ""They've taken the risk by having this vaccine and now they've been told that they can't go back to normal. It's a bit of a hard one to take."" This video can not be played Covid help should not just be for England, says Mark Drakeford The Welsh government said the Treasury needed to ramp up support for businesses in all the UK nations. A spokesperson said: ""Financial support of up to Â£60m will be available to businesses materially affected by these new restrictions. We are working intensively with partners on how that support can most effectively be delivered, and further details will follow as soon as possible. ""However, as the first minister has made clear, the UK government must now step up and provide the financial firepower only HM Treasury can deploy to help support Welsh businesses and employees impacted by the pandemic.

On Monday, of course, it is transfer deadline day. There will be plenty more coverage then!In the meantime, we will leave you with some of today's top stories.  Jeanette Kwakye is joined by Leon Osman and Miguel Delaney to look at the uncertainty around the managerial situation at Everton. We discuss Vitor Pereiraâs unconventional TV appearance and ask how well Frank Lampard would be equipped to turn Evertonâs form around.
Weâre joined by Daniel Wales from âTrue Faithâ, the Newcastle fanzine and podcast, to chat about why itâs proving so difficult to get new players in at St James Park.
And we reflect on Derby Countyâs administrators being given an extra month to provide proof they can fund the club until the end of the season. Newcastle United Norman Riley, True Faith Fanzine and Podcast. ""The earlyish arrivals of Kieran Trippier and Chris Wood have been very much welcomed by Newcastle fans. ""Trippier in particular is already being spoken of as a future captain and the Bruno Guimaraes deal looks close to completion. ""Around 48 hours ago I barely knew anything of him and I am now convinced weâve signed the equivalent of Patrick Viera in 2003. If Guimaraes comes in along with hopefully a centre back (possibly the left-footed Geordie Dan Burn) I should think most Newcastle fans would be overjoyed with the business done."" The PFA has attracted significant criticism over dementia supportfor former players and their families,externaland chief executive Maheta Molango, addressed that speaking to Sky Sports. ""I feel that the PFA is a great institution but it is
clear having discussed this that a number of families feel let down by the PFA,"" Molango said. ""It is a reality and we have to accept it. We may agree and disagree over the reasons but it is a
priority.  We have met with the families and had those difficult talks, to
hear from them. ""People are frustrated and disappointed. It was our
role to listen and try and learn and to try to understand from them how we can
improve. ""It is a very difficult topic that does not have a
solution overnight. It is a collective effort. ""Our view is that we need to get
our own house in order and be a credible voice for the families but then
everyone needs to be responsible. ""Let's be clear the players have not played
for the PFA, or any specific person at the PFA. The players have played for clubs
and for leagues and for the FA at international level so every single
stakeholder, that may be the Premier League, the EFL and the LMA need to be conscious of their
responsibilities. ""We start first with ours but this is a collective matter
which starts with a collective response.â Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Brentford are hoping to tie up a deal to sign Christian Eriksen in the next 48 hours, according toThe Times,external. The 29-year-old will be subject to medical checks having not played since suffering a cardiac arrest at Euro 2020. He was released by Inter earlier this season. Derby v Birmingham (Sun, 13:30GMT) Simon StoneBBC Sport Derby have sold over 30,000 tickets for Sunday's game against Birmingham, underlining how much the club means to supporters. There is a march from the centre of Derby to Pride Park before the game. Wayne Rooney was asked if he had a message for the supporters. ""I
think the message to the fans is to keep supporting us,"" he said. ""We will keep working to
do our job. Stuff off the field is out of our control."" Jesse Lingard's proposed move to Newcastle would be worth every penny of the Â£12m wanted by Manchester United if the Magpies avoid relegation, according to Miguel Delaney, chief football writer at The Independent. The movelooks set to collapsebecause of the financial demands of the Old Trafford club. When asked if Newcastle's transfer window has been quieter than he expected, Delaney said: ""Iâm not that surprised because one of the issues is they have too much money. ""The Jesse Lingard story is indicative of the whole situation. The reason that deal hasnât happened is because Manchester United have set such a high bonus for that deal to go through. ""So if Newcastle stay up and they sign Lingard, they have to pay Manchester United Â£12m. Thatâs what Manchester United want which is huge. ""Everyone knows how much money Newcastle have and he is a player that is better than a club being involved in a relegation battle. There is a fair chance that if Lingard went there he could keep Newcastle up on his own. ""He could score the goals they need and if thatâs the case then that signing is worth a lot more than Â£12m. Itâs really worth Â£100m. ""Everyone knows what Newcastle can become with this money. Ultimately they are one of Manchester Unitedâs future competitors, so why would Manchester United or any club make it easy for them?""

Ofcom to investigate Channel 4 over subtitle outage,"The Last Leg host Adam Hills addressed the ongoing problems in October Broadcasting watchdog Ofcom is to investigate Channel 4 after an extended outage over its subtitle services. The broadcaster experienced several major outages late last year, caused by issues at the centre which handles its playout services. Its subtitling, signing and audio descriptions were all affected, prompting the National Deaf Children's Society to call for action. Channel 4 told the BBC it was sorry for ""significant impact"" of the outage. A statement from Ofcom said: ""We have found that Channel 4 managed to meet the statutory requirement to subtitle 90% of its programme hours over 2021 on most programmes. ""It also met its requirements for audio description and signing."" But the media watchdog added: ""However, Channel 4 fell short of its subtitling quota on Freesat, a satellite TV platform used by around two million UK homes."" Channel 4 subtitles returning after disruption Channel 4 subtitles not returning for weeks Troubled TV firm sorry to deaf and blind viewers The issues originally arose in September after a fire suppression system was triggered at the broadcast centre of Red Bee Media, causing severe damage. The ""extended outage"" of Channel 4's broadcast channels was not fully resolved until November. In a statement to BBC News on Friday, a Channel 4 spokeswoman said: ""We apologise for the significant impact the Red Bee Media incident had on our access services. ""Channel 4 would like to reassure our audiences that we have thoroughly reviewed the resilience of our systems to ensure that such a catastrophic event cannot harm our ability to deliver these essential services in the future. ""Whilst we have not met our own high standards in 2021, we still delivered all of our overall statutory obligations and we are once again offering market-leading access services,"" she added. Ofcom ""remains very concerned"" about the incident, which it said resulted in a ""lengthy outage to Channel 4's access services provision and also wider disruption to its general broadcasts on all platforms"". The authority is now reviewing Channel 4's transmission arrangements and back-up facilities that were in the place at the time, and what they have done about it since. It noted how the broadcaster's ""access services"" are relied on ""by millions, including deaf, hard-of-hearing, blind and partially-sighted people, to watch and listen to television"". In a statement Red Bee Media said ""all services are now restored"" and that it had taken ""extensive measures to understand the cause of the incident"". The company continued by saying it was now ""evaluating all options to make sure it doesn't happen again"". ""The services most affected were operating on older technology platforms,"" it said. ""Red Bee's new platform is inherently more resilient and customers who were already on this platform experienced minimal disruption as a result of the incident.""

Five years in hospital 'is like dad being stolen',"Donnie Watt, in his bed at a hospital in Fife, has spent just five months of the last five years at home The family of a man who has spent most of the last five years in hospital have spoken of their despair at his plight. Donnie Watt has a range of complex medical problems but his daughter Jane fears her father has become ""invisible"" to the health service. The family want the 85-year-old's diagnosis reassessed. Donnie is part of a small number of patients with complex needs who have been resident in Scotland's hospitals for years. Data on hospital beds being ""blocked"" by delayed discharges shows some patients are waiting more than five years to be discharged despite being fit to leave. A delayed discharge is where a patient continues to occupy a hospital bed despite being clinically able to be discharged. It is not a new problem but one which has worsened in the last year of the Covid pandemic as demand has soared across the NHS. Data from Public Health Scotland shows there were 46,894 days spent in hospital as a result of delayed discharge in November, 2021 - a 40% increase on the same month in the previous year. Donnie's daughter Jane Watt said she was worried that people like her dad who have been on hospital wards for years were being overlooked in a stretched health service. She said: ""Everyone in the family feels helpless. ""It feels like my dad has been stolen in some ways and I don't want him to stay misunderstood or invisible."" Jane Watt has submitted a complaint to NHS Fife about her father's situation Donnie was an intelligence officer for the RAF in Berlin during the Cold War before becoming a languages teacher and then running youth hostels in his retirement. ""He was a very sociable person who liked to help people out and was a good conversationalist,"" explained Jane. ""Before he got ill, there began to be odd fluctuations but nothing you could pin down. Then he started sleeping all the time, repeating words, he wouldn't eat and ended up eventually being admitted to a dementia ward."" Donnie's first admission to hospital in 2017 from his Glenrothes home saw a dementia diagnosis - but new symptoms emerged almost daily at points, including spells of only speaking German, according to Jane. Donnie Watt was a linguist for the RAF in Berlin when the city's infamous wall was being built in the 1960s. He later helped to run youth hostels in Scotland Jane said her mother, Patricia, has struggled with Donnie's extended stay in hospital. ""Sometimes she says, I can't do this, I can't drive to that place again,"" Jane explained. ""But she does go - the impact on her is she is in limbo, she sews all the time to distract herself."" In 2020 - despite family reservations - Donnie was judged fit enough to leave hospital. But despite Jane trying 18 nursing homes in the Fife area, a space could not be found and his condition then worsened. The 85-year-old has not been considered well enough to be discharged since then. Patricia and Donnie Watt in their twenties Donnie's family have now submitted a complaint to NHS Fife about his diagnosis and, as what Jane describes a ""last resort"", it includes video and audio clips taken at his bedside to document what she said were his ""densely packed, frequent and highly unusual symptoms"". ""It took years for the cyclicity to be determined, although it was clear on admission and it took years for his two seizure types to be diagnosed,"" said Jane. ""We're asking questions but they are very valid questions, they are my dad's questions - my dad has the right to answers."" Nicky Connor, director of the Fife Health and Social Care Partnership, said Donnie's situation was a ""highly complex case"" and she was unable to comment further on a particular individual ""for reasons of patient confidentiality"". She added: ""The diagnosis of dementia is incredibly difficult for any individual and their family. The ideal is for those living with dementia to be cared for in homely setting. ""For those individuals who have more complex forms of dementia, and whose needs could not be appropriately and safely met at home or in a care home, we have a number of specialist dementia care units in Fife."" Latest available Public Health Scotland figures on so-called bed blocking show there were 1,500 delays in November last year - up from 1,084 in April. The lack of available social care support in the community was the main driver for this increase in tandem with the NHSfacing the ""biggest crisis"" of its existence. The majority of patients face delays of between one day and four weeks. But 14 people had been waiting 12 months or more to be discharged as of November. Â£300m fund to get NHS through 'challenging' winter NHS Scotland's 'biggest crisis' in five charts Care workers 'not adequately valued or rewarded' Separate figures released to BBC Scotland under freedom of information laws show the longest wait an individual delayed discharge patient has had in each health board area. As of October, 2020, NHS Fife had a delayed discharge patient (not Donnie) who had been waiting just over five years to leave hospital, NHS Forth Valley's longest wait was 4.7 years and it was 1.4 years for Scotland's biggest board, NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde. The Fife Health and Social Care Partnership said a ""small number of patients, often with extremely complex needs"" needed to stay in community hospitals until a specialist social care package is put in place. Dr Marion Slater, a geriatrics consultant and council member at the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh, said that more investment in social care was needed or bigger problems with delayed discharge ""will be inevitable"" across the country. She said: ""The main reason for being delayed in hospital is the social care isn't available when they need it or there isn't the equipment they need to get home. ""Particularly frail older people are at risk in hospital of declining if we can't support them with their mobility, if we can't support them with their independence, then they are more likely to develop greater care needs - which creates a vicious circle."" The Scottish government announced aÂ£300m funding package to help the health services get through the winterwhich included a pay rise for social care workers and Â£60m to maximise the capacity of care at home services.

Government must do more on cost of living - minister,"The government needs to do ""a lot more"" to help people struggling with the cost of living, a minister has said, as some Tory MPs called for a rise in National Insurance to be delayed. Defence Minister James Heappey said people were ""feeling the squeeze"" of rising prices and the government was in ""listening mode"". But he said the tax hike, to fund health and social care, was right. No 10 says the rise, which is due in April, will go ahead. It comes after Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Thursday: ""We have to fund the Covid backlog, we have to fix social care."" But Conservative MP Robert Halfon, chair of the Commons Education Select Committee, said the funds should be raised through other means, telling the government to ""go back to the drawing board"". And senior backbench MPs Robert Jenrick and Mel Stride called for the increase to be delayed, with Mr Jenrick saying 2022 would be ""exceptionally hard"" for families. What will the new Health and Social Care tax cost me? Why are prices rising so quickly? Under the plans, employees, employers and the self-employed will all pay 1.25p more in the pound for National Insurance (NI) from April 2022 for a year - after which the extra tax will be collected as a new Health and Social Care Levy. The changes to National Insurance will see an employee on Â£20,000 a year pay an extra Â£89 in tax. Someone on Â£50,000 will pay Â£464 more. From April, people earning under Â£9,880 a year, or Â£823 a month, won't have to pay National Insurance and won't have to pay the new levy. Critics have said the increase will have a higher impact on the lower-paid and could contribute to inflation at a time when household budgets are under pressure. And business leaders have warned that firms could offset the tax rise by raising prices. Asked on BBC One's Question Time whether the NI rise should be delayed, Mr Heappey acknowledged that ""everybody at home is feeling the squeeze"" in the face of rising food and energy bills, and the government would ""need to do a lot"" over the next few years to help people with this. Mr Heappey said the top of government was in ""listening mode at the moment"", but he defended the planned rise, saying it would ""raise money that is much needed"". Mr Halfon agreed that the funds were needed for the NHS and social care but called for the government to ""look again"" at other ways of raising the funds, including a windfall tax on firms that made big profits during the pandemic or by raising capital gains tax. Capital gains tax is paid on profits made when someone sells, gives away or disposes of something they own, including shares that are not in an ISA. Governments sometimes levy windfall taxes when companies have made large, unexpected profits - especially if they have benefited from economic conditions. Mr Halfon told BBC Radio 4's Today programme a ""cost of living package"" was needed to reduce taxes for the lower paid, which he said could be funded through cuts the government has made to the foreign aid budget and with changes to the green levy. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the planned rise came at a time when inflation was at its highest level in 30 years. Speaking to broadcasters on a visit to Glasgow, he added: ""It was the wrong thing to do and we argued strongly it shouldn't have happened."" This video can not be played Defence minister James Heappey says the government is ""in listening mode"" Mr Jenrick, the former housing secretary, told BBC Two's Newsnight that 2022 was going to be an ""exceptionally hard year"" for families and a delay in rising NI ""looks increasingly like a sensible thing for the government to do"". Mr Stride, chair of the Treasury Select Committee, also told the programme he believed there was ""wiggle room"" in the public finances to allow for a delay in the increase due to lower than expected borrowing. But when asked on Friday if the rise was happening ""no ifs, no buts"", the prime minister's official spokesman said ""yeah"". He added: ""I think the chancellor set out at the time when we announced this policy why it is the right and best way to raise this money."" Mike Padgham, chairman of the Independent Care Group, told BBC 5 Live he supported the idea of extra funding for social care from general taxation rather than from a rise in NI. But he added: ""What is clear is that we have had decades of promises to fund social care properly but it has never come. So I am very worried that if it is scrapped then we will never get the funding."" The government says the changes are expected to raise Â£12bn a year, which will go initially towards easing pressure on the NHS . A proportion will then be moved into social care system over the next three years. Meanwhile, the prime minister continues to wait for senior civil servant Sue Gray's report into parties held at Downing Street during the pandemic. On Friday, theMetropolitan Police said it had asked Ms Gray to make ""minimal reference"" in her report to events the force is lookingat for its investigation into Covid rule breaking.

Ahead of the 50th anniversary, the ex-prime minister said that was a ""proper apology"" that left no room for doubt. Thirteen people were shot dead when soldiers opened fire on civil rights demonstrators in Londonderry on 30 January 1972. After reading the Saville Inquiry into the day's events, Mr Cameron considered how he felt about what he had read,he told BBC Talkback's William Crawley. ""It seemed to me that those words [unjustified and unjustifiable] best summed it up,"" he said. ""You couldn't leave any doubt. ""Unjustified and unjustifiable means let's not go on arguing about this, what happened was wrong, full stop, end of and let's make a proper apology. ""Sometimes with these sort of events politicians - and I can be guilty of this - qualify the apology or shade around the edges. ""On this occasion it needed to be absolutely direct and clear."" Mr Cameron madethe remarks in the House of Commonsand said he was unsure how they would be received in Derry. He added: ""I remember watching the news later that day and being very moved by the scenes and understanding how much this had meant to people."" The march on Bloody Sunday was in protest against a new law giving the authorities the power to imprison people without trial Mr Cameron said he understood why the Bloody Sunday families continued to seek justice. ""Obviously one feels incredible sympathy for people who have been through that appalling experience,"" he said. ""Then it's really a double jeopardy, of having your relatives suffer in that and for so long not having a faithful account of what actually happened, and taking so long for the truth to come out and of course you understand why those people want not just the truth but the justice that should follow."" What happened on Bloody Sunday? Bloody Sunday: The victims Meanwhile, Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) MicheÃ¡l Martin has said the events of Bloody Sunday were indelibly imprinted on the minds of families across the island of Ireland. On Sunday he will lay a wreath at a memorial service in Derry - the first serving taoiseach to do so. ""It was a huge turning point in some respects and remains on as an enduring injustice at the heart of the Northern Ireland Troubles,"" Mr Martin toldBBC Radio Foyle. He paid tribute to the ""persistence, dignity, and resilience"" of the Bloody Sunday victims' families, some of whom he will meet privately on Sunday. He added: ""The journey of justice was a long one, but I think it now stands as a monument in itself and an inspiration to others around the world. ""They got the truth, they got a state apology from the British prime minister and they got support from subsequent Irish governments but it went on too long"". Politicians, he added, must learn from the past and save future generations from violence. An anniversary mass was held in St Mary's Church in the city on Friday, at which Bishop Donal McKeown said the people of Derry had shown ""great dignity and courage"" in the intervening 50 years. ""The suffering endured has borne the seed of solidarity and not merely of anger,"" he told those gathered. ""It takes a wise heart to look at the rubble ofÂ what has been shattered inÂ the past and to make it into a foundation for the future."" Internment, Protest and Bloody Sunday,external Peter Taylor Analysis: Bloody Sunday 50 years on On Wednesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson alsopaid tribute to the Bloody Sunday victims' familiesduring Prime Minister's Questions. Mr Johnson described it as ""one of the darkest days in our history"" and said in the run up to the anniversary ""we must learn from the past, reconcile and build a shared and prosperous future"". You can hear David Cameron'sfull interview with William Crawley on Talkback here Guildhall Square was packed for David Cameron's apology on behalf of the state in 2010 Two public inquiries have been carried out into the events of Bloody Sunday. The Widgery Tribunal, which was announced shortly after Bloody Sunday, largely cleared the soldiers and British authorities of blame. The Saville Inquiry, published in 2010, found none of the casualties were posing a threat or doing anything that would justify their shooting. The then Prime Minister David Cameron issued an apology on behalf of the state in the House of Commons, sayingthe killings were ""unjustified and unjustifiable"". Following the publication of the Saville Inquiry, the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) began a murder investigation in 2010. It took a number of years to complete and detectives then submitted their files to the Public Prosecution Service (PPS) towards the end of 2016. Having weighed up 125,000 pages of material, prosecutors said on 14 March they would prosecute a soldier, known only as Soldier F, for the murders of James Wray and William McKinney on Bloody Sunday. Soldier F also faced charges for the attempted murders of Patrick O'Donnell, Joseph Friel, Joe Mahon and Michael Quinn. On 2 July 2021, it was announced Soldier F would not face trial following a decision by the PPS. The PPS said after ""careful consideration"" the decision had been taken due to another recent court ruling which found evidence being relied upon in the prosecutionof Soldier A and Soldier C for the killing of Joe McCannwas inadmissible. This was due to the circumstances in which the evidence was obtained. The decision not to proceed with the case is now the subject of live judicial review proceedings following a legal challenge brought by a brother of one of the Bloody Sunday victims.

LiveLiveTransfer window latest - three days until deadline dayAll the latest news from the transfer window as clubs look to complete deals before the deadline on Monday.,"Newcastle reportedly agree fee for Lyon midfielder Bruno Guimaraes Barcelona in talks to sign Wolves winger Adama Traore Jesse Lingard appears set to stay at Man Utd Final talks set over Everton manager's job Get involved: #bbcfootball or text 81111 (UK only, standard message rates apply) Steve Sutcliffe and Harry De Cosemo Thanks for joining us today and through all of this week!There may be no Premier League action this weekend, but there is plenty from the EFL. On Monday, of course, it is transfer deadline day. There will be plenty more coverage then!In the meantime, we will leave you with some of today's top stories.  Jeanette Kwakye is joined by Leon Osman and Miguel Delaney to look at the uncertainty around the managerial situation at Everton. We discuss Vitor Pereiraâs unconventional TV appearance and ask how well Frank Lampard would be equipped to turn Evertonâs form around.
Weâre joined by Daniel Wales from âTrue Faithâ, the Newcastle fanzine and podcast, to chat about why itâs proving so difficult to get new players in at St James Park.
And we reflect on Derby Countyâs administrators being given an extra month to provide proof they can fund the club until the end of the season. Newcastle United Norman Riley, True Faith Fanzine and Podcast. ""The earlyish arrivals of Kieran Trippier and Chris Wood have been very much welcomed by Newcastle fans. ""Trippier in particular is already being spoken of as a future captain and the Bruno Guimaraes deal looks close to completion. ""Around 48 hours ago I barely knew anything of him and I am now convinced weâve signed the equivalent of Patrick Viera in 2003. If Guimaraes comes in along with hopefully a centre back (possibly the left-footed Geordie Dan Burn) I should think most Newcastle fans would be overjoyed with the business done."" The PFA has attracted significant criticism over dementia supportfor former players and their families,externaland chief executive Maheta Molango, addressed that speaking to Sky Sports. ""I feel that the PFA is a great institution but it is
clear having discussed this that a number of families feel let down by the PFA,"" Molango said. ""It is a reality and we have to accept it. We may agree and disagree over the reasons but it is a
priority.  We have met with the families and had those difficult talks, to
hear from them. ""People are frustrated and disappointed. It was our
role to listen and try and learn and to try to understand from them how we can
improve. ""It is a very difficult topic that does not have a
solution overnight. It is a collective effort. ""Our view is that we need to get
our own house in order and be a credible voice for the families but then
everyone needs to be responsible. ""Let's be clear the players have not played
for the PFA, or any specific person at the PFA. The players have played for clubs
and for leagues and for the FA at international level so every single
stakeholder, that may be the Premier League, the EFL and the LMA need to be conscious of their
responsibilities. ""We start first with ours but this is a collective matter
which starts with a collective response.â Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

There were some illuminating comments about the how the workload is taking it's toll on players. ""I want my kids to see the best version of their heroes and right now they are not because what they are seeing is a B, C or D version of them because it is just impossible,"" Molango said. ""You cannot be playing in La Paz in Bolivia at 1,000 metres on a Thursday and then be on Saturday playing against Leeds or Burnley or Arsenal and be expected to deliver. It is just impossible. ""Then on Tuesday, you travel away and play a Champions League game and on Saturday you play a cup game. It just doesnât work. âI think what the players are now seeing is that some of the people that they respect a lot, the top professionals are now struggling. There are examples now of players who cannot play 20 games in a season. âTop professionals who really look after themselves and they canât play 20 games."" Allow Twitter content?

The 29-year-old will be subject to medical checks having not played since suffering a cardiac arrest at Euro 2020. He was released by Inter earlier this season. Derby v Birmingham (Sun, 13:30GMT) Simon StoneBBC Sport Derby have sold over 30,000 tickets for Sunday's game against Birmingham, underlining how much the club means to supporters. There is a march from the centre of Derby to Pride Park before the game. Wayne Rooney was asked if he had a message for the supporters. ""I
think the message to the fans is to keep supporting us,"" he said. ""We will keep working to
do our job. Stuff off the field is out of our control."" Jesse Lingard's proposed move to Newcastle would be worth every penny of the Â£12m wanted by Manchester United if the Magpies avoid relegation, according to Miguel Delaney, chief football writer at The Independent. The movelooks set to collapsebecause of the financial demands of the Old Trafford club. When asked if Newcastle's transfer window has been quieter than he expected, Delaney said: ""Iâm not that surprised because one of the issues is they have too much money. ""The Jesse Lingard story is indicative of the whole situation. The reason that deal hasnât happened is because Manchester United have set such a high bonus for that deal to go through. ""So if Newcastle stay up and they sign Lingard, they have to pay Manchester United Â£12m. Thatâs what Manchester United want which is huge. ""Everyone knows how much money Newcastle have and he is a player that is better than a club being involved in a relegation battle. There is a fair chance that if Lingard went there he could keep Newcastle up on his own. ""He could score the goals they need and if thatâs the case then that signing is worth a lot more than Â£12m. Itâs really worth Â£100m. ""Everyone knows what Newcastle can become with this money. Ultimately they are one of Manchester Unitedâs future competitors, so why would Manchester United or any club make it easy for them?""

UK warned to bolster defences against cyber attacks,"UK organisations are being urged to bolster their defences amid fears cyber attacks linked to the conflict in Ukraine could move beyond its borders. The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) has issued new guidance, saying it is vital companies stay ahead of a potential threat. The centre said it was unaware of any specific threats to UK organisations. It follows a series of cyber attacks in Ukraine which are suspected to have involved Russia, which Moscow denies. In December 2015, engineers in Ukrainian power stations saw cursors on their computer screens moving by themselves. They had been hacked. Hundreds of thousands of people lost power for hours. It was the first time a power station had been taken offline, a sign that cyber intrusions were moving beyond stealing information into disrupting the infrastructure on which everyday life depends. Russia was blamed. ""It was a complex operation,"" says John Hultquist, an expert on Russian cyber operations at the US security firm Mandiant. ""They even disrupted the telephone lines so that the engineers couldn't make calls."" Ukraine has been on the front line of a cyber conflict for years. But if Russia does invade the country soon, tanks and troops will still be at the forefront. ""If the aim is to conquer Ukraine, you don't do that with computers,"" says Ciaran Martin, who ran NCSC until 2020 - an arm of the UK's intelligence, security and cyber agency, GCHQ. But cyber attacks are likely to support hard power, disrupting key services like power and communications to sow confusion. And even if the military conflict remains confined within Ukraine's borders, there are fears cyber attacks could spread. In June 2017, Ukraine was the epicentre of an incident with global repercussions. Hackers got inside software used to file tax returns. Companies were then hit with ransomware - a demand they pay money to unlock their computers. Western governments would later say Russian military intelligence was responsible and that the real intent was not to profit but disrupt and blame it on criminals. Russia denied any role in this and other attacks. In that case, the attack spun out of control as the malicious software spread beyond Ukraine's borders.  International companies, including many in the UK, found their operations crippled. ""At one point around a fifth of the world's merchant shipping fleet was being controlled by WhatsApp because their computer systems weren't working,"" recalls Ciaran Martin. The global cost was estimated at $5-10bn. In the last few weeks, Ukrainian institutions - this time largely government - have been hit again. Although there has been no conclusive proof of who was responsible, US authorities issued a sweeping warning because of ""alarming"" similarities to 2017, telling all organisations in the US - regardless of sector or size - to take ""urgent"" steps to reduce the likelihood of a damaging attack, and for anyone working with Ukrainian organisations to take extra care. Cyber attacks affecting communication are expected if Russia invades Ukraine That warning was just one sign of growing concern of spill over. GCHQ and NSA - the US's cyber intelligence agency, have both been closely monitoring Russian cyber plans and working to share information faster, including with Ukraine. In recent weeks, security meetings have taken place looking at the possible domestic impact of events in Ukraine with a series of alerts issued to industry. The most worrying possibility is that Russia goes after Western infrastructure in an echo of the 2015 attack on Ukrainian power stations. ""We've seen them trying to gain access all through Europe and the US for years by targeting those energy systems, water systems, airports,"" says John Hultquist. ""We think that they're dug in already there."" That knowledge has led US and UK security authorities to issue alerts in recent weeks specifically aimed at critical industries. In the US, infrastructure companies have been told to adopt a ""heightened state of awareness"" and search for signs of Russian hackers already on their systems. In the UK in recent weeks, critical national infrastructure - which includes energy supply, water supply, transportation, health and telecommunications - have been warned by the NCSC about specific vulnerabilities known to be exploited by Russian hackers. Based on experience in Ukraine, energy and transport are most likely to be in the cross-hairs if anything were to happen. ""While we are unaware of any specific cyber threats to UK organisations in relation to events in Ukraine, we are monitoring the situation closely and it is vital that organisations follow the guidance to ensure they are resilient,"" Paul Chichester, the NCSC director of operations said in a statement accompanying the latest guidance issued on Friday. Many experts are cautious about the likelihood of attacks on infrastructure actually taking place though. ""It is not impossible. But it is quite unlikely,' says Ciaran Martin. ""It's certainly not a cause for panic."" One reason is that, although the US and UK will not admit it, their own intelligence agencies are also deep inside Russian networks and able to retaliate. Moscow knows this, leading to a recognition of the dangers of escalating towards mutually-assured cyber destruction. ""The Russians will likely initially try hard to keep any of their cyber offensive activity contained to Ukraine - so as not to escalate the conflict with US and Nato at the same time as they are prosecuting a war with Ukraine,"" argues Dmitri Alperovitch, founder of the US-based Silverado Policy Accelerator and an expert on Russian cyber operations ""That calculus may change, however, if they have severe economic sanctions imposed upon them by the West - then the gloves may come off."" Piles of money were seized by the Russian authorities when a criminal group linked to hacking was arrested This is where the risks may lie. If the West does impose significant economic sanctions in response to Russian military action, Moscow could respond by targeting Western economies through cyberspace. And here it may have options beyond a risky full-frontal assault. In recent years, criminal groups based in Russia have been blamed for a growing tide of ransomware attacks, those affected including UK schools and councils and even the Irish health system. An attack on a US energy pipeline led President Biden to call on Russia to clamp down on the hackers. This month, Russia surprised observers by seeming to do just that, publicly arresting members of one group - known as REvil. This could have been a message, Ciaran Martin argues. ""Our basic assumption has to be that these (arrests) are cynically timed and designed to show the West that they can control these people should they choose to. If they don't like certain sanctions or other parts of the Western response, it is possible that some of these criminal gangs get the softer treatment."" Such a scenario is one of those being considered credible by UK security officials. And if they are hit online, the US and UK will have to work out how to respond - all amid fears of a cyber-conflict that could escalate.

"Bankers' rate 'rigging' not criminal, says US","Matthew Connolly said he was ""speechless"" to have won in court A US appeals court has overturned the convictions of two former Deutsche Bank traders who were prosecuted for rigging interest rates. In a legally significant judgment, US judges acquitted Matthew Connolly, 56, from New Jersey and Gavin Black, 52, from Twickenham, Middlesex. The court ruled that their conduct was not against the rules. It means that what has been prosecuted as interest rate rigging in the UK is not regarded as a crime in the US. The US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled that it was not against the rules to seek to influence the estimates a bank submits of the cost of borrowing cash. That directly contradicts a key British appeal court ruling that was used to prosecute 24 traders, nine of whom were jailed between 2015 and 2019. 'They wanted to jail a banker - I was that banker' âIâm being jailed for four emails from 12 years agoâ For Mr Connolly and Mr Black, it's the end of an eight-year struggle to prove that what they were accused of was not criminal. The evidence against Matt Connolly was just four emails from 14 years ago, asking for high or low interest rate estimates to be submitted. Matt Connolly told the BBC on Thursday he was ""speechless"" to have won in court for the first time. ""My family and I are very thankful this ordeal is finally ending, and that the courts have finally recognised once and for all my innocence,"" he said. ""I am hoping the rest of the story emerges so others that have been denied justice get their peace as well."" ""The nine trials on both sides of the Atlantic have been a whole series of miscarriages of justice where innocent people were jailed who had done nothing wrong. ""The only Libor 'rigging' that was really bad was the lowballing. That was ordered from the top - from central banks and governments. And neither the Department of Justice nor the Serious Fraud Office has ever brought that to trial."" The evidence against Mr Connolly was only four emails that he had sent 12 years previously. A BBC investigation in 2019 raised questions about the safety of his convictions. A few weeks later, a judge in the New York court gave them light sentences of home confinement after learning that the Bank of England had been involved in the same conduct on a much larger scale. Judge Colleen McMahon said at the time: ""I'm always uncomfortable when I'm asked in any context - it usually happens in the drug context - to sentence the low man on the totem pole while the big guy goes free."" The evidence against traders, both in the US and the UK, were emails and messages requesting that colleagues publish ""high"" or ""low"" estimates of the cost of borrowing cash. The estimates would be averaged to get a rate called Libor (London Interbank Offered Rate) which is being phased out in favour of other benchmarks. What the FTSE or Nikkei are to share prices, Libor was to interest rates - an index that tracked the cost of borrowing cash between the banks. It was used to set interest rates on millions of residential and commercial loans around the world. To work out Libor each day, 16 banks answered a question - at what interest rate could they borrow money? They submitted their answers and an average was taken. The evidence against Tom Hayes and other traders consisted of messages and emails asking for those interest rates to be submitted ""high"" or ""low"". There were no laws or written regulations about Libor at the time the traders made the requests. In late 2014, lawyers for Tom Hayes, the first trader jailed for rate rigging, argued that because there was no rule against the traders' requests the case should be dismissed. In January 2015, Lord Justice Davies ruled that it was ""self-evident"" that the requests were against the rules. Banks were not allowed to take into account commercial interests, such as trading positions linked to the Libor rate, when making their estimates. That ruling was used to prosecute 24 traders in the UK. Mr Hayes, who got the longest sentence, told the BBC: ""This considered court ruling completely contradicts [UK] Court of Appeal rulings ahead of my trial. ""Those rulings formed the basis of the case in law to prosecute not only myself but every trader subsequently who faced trial. ""Four times, traders have been denied leave by the Court of Appeal to make the case to the Supreme Court, when there is clearly a point of law of significance that needs to be heard at the highest level. ""I hope that the British courts will, in time, reach the same conclusion."" If you want to know more about this story, a BBC Radio 4 investigative podcast, The Lowball Tapes, will contain exclusive revelations. It will be broadcast in five parts, starting on 28 February at 1.45pm.

"Government must do more on cost of living - ministerJames Heappey concedes people are ""feeling the squeeze"", but defends the planned National Insurance rise.","The government needs to do ""a lot more"" to help people struggling with the cost of living, a minister has said, as some Tory MPs called for a rise in National Insurance to be delayed. Defence Minister James Heappey said people were ""feeling the squeeze"" of rising prices and the government was in ""listening mode"". But he said the tax hike, to fund health and social care, was right. No 10 says the rise, which is due in April, will go ahead. It comes after Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Thursday: ""We have to fund the Covid backlog, we have to fix social care."" But Conservative MP Robert Halfon, chair of the Commons Education Select Committee, said the funds should be raised through other means, telling the government to ""go back to the drawing board"". And senior backbench MPs Robert Jenrick and Mel Stride called for the increase to be delayed, with Mr Jenrick saying 2022 would be ""exceptionally hard"" for families. What will the new Health and Social Care tax cost me? Why are prices rising so quickly? Under the plans, employees, employers and the self-employed will all pay 1.25p more in the pound for National Insurance (NI) from April 2022 for a year - after which the extra tax will be collected as a new Health and Social Care Levy. The changes to National Insurance will see an employee on Â£20,000 a year pay an extra Â£89 in tax. Someone on Â£50,000 will pay Â£464 more. From April, people earning under Â£9,880 a year, or Â£823 a month, won't have to pay National Insurance and won't have to pay the new levy. Critics have said the increase will have a higher impact on the lower-paid and could contribute to inflation at a time when household budgets are under pressure. And business leaders have warned that firms could offset the tax rise by raising prices. Asked on BBC One's Question Time whether the NI rise should be delayed, Mr Heappey acknowledged that ""everybody at home is feeling the squeeze"" in the face of rising food and energy bills, and the government would ""need to do a lot"" over the next few years to help people with this. Mr Heappey said the top of government was in ""listening mode at the moment"", but he defended the planned rise, saying it would ""raise money that is much needed"". Mr Halfon agreed that the funds were needed for the NHS and social care but called for the government to ""look again"" at other ways of raising the funds, including a windfall tax on firms that made big profits during the pandemic or by raising capital gains tax. Capital gains tax is paid on profits made when someone sells, gives away or disposes of something they own, including shares that are not in an ISA. Governments sometimes levy windfall taxes when companies have made large, unexpected profits - especially if they have benefited from economic conditions. Mr Halfon told BBC Radio 4's Today programme a ""cost of living package"" was needed to reduce taxes for the lower paid, which he said could be funded through cuts the government has made to the foreign aid budget and with changes to the green levy. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the planned rise came at a time when inflation was at its highest level in 30 years. Speaking to broadcasters on a visit to Glasgow, he added: ""It was the wrong thing to do and we argued strongly it shouldn't have happened."" This video can not be played Defence minister James Heappey says the government is ""in listening mode"" Mr Jenrick, the former housing secretary, told BBC Two's Newsnight that 2022 was going to be an ""exceptionally hard year"" for families and a delay in rising NI ""looks increasingly like a sensible thing for the government to do"". Mr Stride, chair of the Treasury Select Committee, also told the programme he believed there was ""wiggle room"" in the public finances to allow for a delay in the increase due to lower than expected borrowing. But when asked on Friday if the rise was happening ""no ifs, no buts"", the prime minister's official spokesman said ""yeah"". He added: ""I think the chancellor set out at the time when we announced this policy why it is the right and best way to raise this money."" Mike Padgham, chairman of the Independent Care Group, told BBC 5 Live he supported the idea of extra funding for social care from general taxation rather than from a rise in NI. But he added: ""What is clear is that we have had decades of promises to fund social care properly but it has never come. So I am very worried that if it is scrapped then we will never get the funding."" The government says the changes are expected to raise Â£12bn a year, which will go initially towards easing pressure on the NHS . A proportion will then be moved into social care system over the next three years. Meanwhile, the prime minister continues to wait for senior civil servant Sue Gray's report into parties held at Downing Street during the pandemic. On Friday, theMetropolitan Police said it had asked Ms Gray to make ""minimal reference"" in her report to events the force is lookingat for its investigation into Covid rule breaking.

"Bankers rate 'rigging' not criminal, says US","Matthew Connolly said he was ""speechless"" to have won in court A US appeals court has overturned the convictions of two former Deutsche Bank traders who were prosecuted for rigging interest rates. In a legally significant judgment, US judges acquitted Matthew Connolly, 56, from New Jersey and Gavin Black, 52, from Twickenham, Middlesex. The court ruled that their conduct was not against the rules. It means that what has been prosecuted as interest rate rigging in the UK is not regarded as a crime in the US. The US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled that it was not against the rules to seek to influence the estimates a bank submits of the cost of borrowing cash.

What the FTSE or Nikkei are to share prices, Libor was to interest rates - an index that tracked the cost of borrowing cash between the banks. It was used to set interest rates on millions of residential and commercial loans around the world. To work out Libor each day, 16 banks answered a question - at what interest rate could they borrow money? They submitted their answers and an average was taken. The evidence against Tom Hayes and other traders consisted of messages and emails asking for those interest rates to be submitted ""high"" or ""low"". There were no laws or written regulations about Libor at the time the traders made the requests.

In January 2015, Lord Justice Davies ruled that it was ""self-evident"" that the requests were against the rules. Banks were not allowed to take into account commercial interests, such as trading positions linked to the Libor rate, when making their estimates.

"Nord Stream 2 and the Ukraine crisis, explained","Nord Stream 1, Russia's largest gas pipeline to Europe, has been closed indefinitely after a number of leaks were found in it and a parallel pipeline, Nord Stream 2. EU leaders say the leaks were caused deliberately. Russia denies it's to blame. The Nord Stream 1 pipeline normally supplies European Union states with about 35% of all the gas they import from Russia. The undersea pipeline stretches 1,200km (745 miles) under the Baltic Sea from the Russian coast near St Petersburg to north-eastern Germany. It opened in 2011, and can send a maximum of 170m cubic metres of gas per day from Russia to Germany. The pipeline is owned and operated by Nord Stream AG, whose majority shareholder is the Russian state-owned company Gazprom. Gazprom is also behind the building of a parallel gas pipeline, Nord Stream 2, which was due to come on stream this year. Germany postponed granting it an operating licencebecause of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Russia has been reducing gas supplies through Nord Stream 1 for a number of months. In June, it cut deliveries through the pipeline by 75% - from 170m cubic metres of gas a day to roughly 40m cubic metres. In July, Russia shut it down for 10 days,citing the need for maintenance. When it reopened, the flow was halved to 20m cubic metres a day. In late August, it shut down Nord Stream 1 entirely,blaming problems with equipment. The pipeline has not been open since then. In late September, Norway and Denmark reported four leaks in both the Nord Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2 pipelines in the Baltic Sea, near the island of Bornholm. Seismologists say they detected explosions under the sea in the same area. The pipelines were filled with gas at the time, even though the gas was not flowing through them. Huge gas bubbles rose to the surface of the sea, the largest being 1km in diameter. This video can not be played Watch: Footage from the Danish Defence of what it says is a gas leak from the pipelines European Commission head Ursula von der Leyen has saidthe pipelines were probably sabotaged, but both the EU and the US have stopped short of naming Russia as the culprit. Russia has denied responsibility. Gazprom says it is ""impossible"" to say when Nord Stream 1 might reopen. David Fyfe, chief economist with research firm Argus Media, says Russia may use the closure to put political pressure on Europe. ""It may hope Europe might pressure Ukraine to recognise territory annexation, in return for Russia restoring pipeline flows,"" he says. Europe - and in particular Germany - has become increasingly reliant on Russian gas to meet its energy needs. Over the past year, Russia has cut its gas supplies to EU states by 88%, according to Mr Fyfe. Wholesale prices of gas in Europe have more than doubled over the same period, he says. Gas prices have risen by a similar amount in the UK, even though it imports no gas from Russia, because the shortages have severely affected the international gas market. The high price of gas is affecting household budgets across Europe and driving up costs for manufacturing firms, says Carole Nakhle from Crystol Energy. ""This could cause slowdowns in European economies and accelerate the route towards recession,"" she says. Nord Stream 1 previously supplied Germany with the majority of its gas from Russia EU member states have agreed tocut gas usage by 15%. The German government hopes to reduce gas usage by 2%by limiting the use of lighting and heating in public buildings this winter. Spain has already brought in similar measures and Switzerland is considering doing the same. Before Russia invaded Ukraine, Germany relied on Russia for 55% of its gas. It has managed to reduce this to 35% and wants eventually to reduce imports to zero by importing gas from other countries. Germany is also increasing its use of coal and extending the life of power stations which it had been planning to shut down - despite the negative environmental impact. The Brandenburg Gate in Berlin had its lights turned off in July Can the world cope without Russian oil and gas? Many European citizens are also taking steps themselves. ""In Germany,"" says Ms Nakhle, ""people are buying wood stoves and installing solar panels to reduce gas usage. ""We should not underestimate how seriously people are taking the prospect of gas shortages.""

"Kremlin media: Ukraine the aggressor, not Russia","Russian TV accuses Ukraine of preparing to attack separatists Just like in the West, in Russia the media is closely following the chance of further conflict in Ukraine. However, Kremlin-controlled outlets have their own version of who is likely to start it. They portray Ukraine as the aggressor preparing to mount an unprovoked attack on areas controlled by Moscow-backed separatists. Pro-Kremlin media say the government in Kyiv is encouraged by the West, which is driven by a blind hatred of Russia. The likelihood of a Russian invasion of Ukraine is laughed off, but the Kremlin's media messaging seems designed to convince Russians that it would be entirely justified. How will we know if war has started in Ukraine? What is Nato and why doesn't Russia trust it? For the Kremlin's media machine, Ukraine is the source of many evils. For years, it has been accusing the government in Kyiv of Nazi leanings and of waging a campaign of persecution against Russian speakers. So recent accusations that Ukraine is about to mount an unprovoked attack on civilians in rebel-held parts of the Donbas region will come as no surprise to Russian TV viewers. Such claims often come from separatist figures installed in eastern Ukraine with Moscow's backing. For example, the main rebel leader in the so-called Donetsk People's Republic, Denis Pushilin, appeared on Russian state TV to say Kyiv had deployed ""all of the Ukrainian army's strike forces"" to the region in preparation for an attack. Another Donetsk separatist, Eduard Basurin, has been shown alleging that Ukraine was preparing to target civilian infrastructure. In turn, these allegations have led to calls for Russia to intervene. On 26 January, key TV channels aired an appeal by Andrei Turchak, a leading member of the ruling United Russia party. ""Peaceful civilians are being killed while Western patrons are pushing the Ukrainian junta towards a direct invasion of Donbas,"" he said. ""Under these circumstances Russia must provide the necessary assistance to the Luhansk and Donetsk people's republics by supplying certain types of weapons."" Amid Russian media claims of an impending Ukrainian attack, US officials warned that Russia may bepreparing a false-flag operationto justify a new military invasion. Russian media refers to the UK and the US as 'Anglo-Saxons', and sees them as particular adversaries The possibility that Russia may attack Ukraine has been strenuously denied by pro-Kremlin voices. For example, state TV's Channel One has dismissed this threat as ""imaginary"", and the presenter of its daytime political talk show could not suppress a chuckle when talking about allegations of ""ongoing Russian aggression"" against Ukraine. As for the 100,000 Russian troops reportedly massed on the border with Ukraine, they get much less attention. When they do, the message is that Moscow is free to do whatever it likes with its own troops on its own territory. Kremlin-controlled media deny that Russia is involved with the separatist groups in east Ukraine, and present the annexation of the Ukrainian region of Crimea in 2014 as a ""reunification"". For pro-Kremlin media, Ukraine is just a pawn in a wider confrontation between Russia and the West Worrying as tensions with Ukraine are, they are seen by Kremlin-controlled media as part of a wider, more important story - that of a long-running confrontation between Russia and the West. Ukraine itself is portrayed as nothing more than a failing state incapable of pursuing an independent policy, and is therefore manipulated by the Russia-hating West. Russian officials and the media have developed their own vocabulary to present their argument: ""the collective West"" is accused of waging a campaign of ""military assimilation"" of Ukraine and is ""pumping weapons"" into the country. The US and the UK are seen as particularly die-hard adversaries of Russia, and are often referred to as ""the Anglo-Saxons"".

Apple unveils AirTag safety guide amid stalker fearsApple has released an updated safety guide amid ongoing concerns over the company's AirTag device.,"Apple AirTag Apple has released an updated safety guide amid ongoing concerns over the company's AirTag devices. The company quietly released the safety portal on Monday. The Personal User Safety Guide offers advice on how people can keep themselves and their data safe. AirTags are designed to locate lost items using Apple's powerful 'Find My' network. They are small button-shaped items that can be attached to keys or a wallet. However, the BBC and other outlets have previously found evidence that AirTags have been misused to track people. Apple's newPersonal User Safety Guide,externaloffers support for people who are ""concerned about or experiencing technology-enabled abuse, stalking or harassment"". The guide says it offers ""step-by-step"" instructions on how users can protect themselves. Apple AirTags - 'A perfect tool for stalking' Its AirTags section shows users what to do if they are alerted to an unwanted AirTag - a notification that appears on the screen of an iPhone. It also highlights what to do if you hear or find an AirTag that doesn't belong to you. The guide shows Android users how they can download an app that will help alert users to rogue AirTags. Last week the BBC reported that several women had been notified that AirTags were tracking them without their knowledge. One woman said she found an AirTag taped to the inside of her bag. Eva Galperin, director of Cyber-Security at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, told the BBC: ""If you create an item which is useful for tracking stolen items, then you have also created a perfect tool for stalking."" This video can not be played Amber Norsworthy received a phone notification saying an unknown accessory was tracking her Apple had told the BBC it created several safeguards to protect people, but was looking at ways to further secure AirTags over time. Similar tracking products to AirTags, like Tile, do not come with safeguards against tracking people - though Tile told the BBC they were working on an update. When Apple launched AirTag in April 2021, they made clear that they were designed ""to track items not people"". The guide also shows users how Apple products can be used to protect privacy and safety, including: How to remove someone's access to location data, previously shared with them How to automatically let a friend know when you've arrived home safely How to engage an Emergency SOS An Apple spokesperson told the BBC: ""We take customer safety very seriously and are committed to AirTag's privacy and security"".

"Bankers rate 'rigging' not criminal, says USThe decision by a US appeals court directly contradicts a British court ruling on the cases.","Matthew Connolly said he was ""speechless"" to have won in court A US appeals court has overturned the convictions of two former Deutsche Bank traders who were prosecuted for rigging interest rates.

Judge Colleen McMahon said at the time: ""I'm always uncomfortable when I'm asked in any context - it usually happens in the drug context - to sentence the low man on the totem pole while the big guy goes free."" The evidence against traders, both in the US and the UK, were emails and messages requesting that colleagues publish ""high"" or ""low"" estimates of the cost of borrowing cash. The estimates would be averaged to get a rate called Libor (London Interbank Offered Rate) which is being phased out in favour of other benchmarks. What the FTSE or Nikkei are to share prices, Libor was to interest rates - an index that tracked the cost of borrowing cash between the banks. It was used to set interest rates on millions of residential and commercial loans around the world. To work out Libor each day, 16 banks answered a question - at what interest rate could they borrow money? They submitted their answers and an average was taken. The evidence against Tom Hayes and other traders consisted of messages and emails asking for those interest rates to be submitted ""high"" or ""low"". There were no laws or written regulations about Libor at the time the traders made the requests. In late 2014, lawyers for Tom Hayes, the first trader jailed for rate rigging, argued that because there was no rule against the traders' requests the case should be dismissed. In January 2015, Lord Justice Davies ruled that it was ""self-evident"" that the requests were against the rules. Banks were not allowed to take into account commercial interests, such as trading positions linked to the Libor rate, when making their estimates. That ruling was used to prosecute 24 traders in the UK. Mr Hayes, who got the longest sentence, told the BBC: ""This considered court ruling completely contradicts [UK] Court of Appeal rulings ahead of my trial. ""Those rulings formed the basis of the case in law to prosecute not only myself but every trader subsequently who faced trial.

Former traders cleared in US of rate 'rigging',"Matthew Connolly said he was ""speechless"" to have won in court A US appeals court has overturned the convictions of two former Deutsche Bank traders who were prosecuted for rigging interest rates. In a legally significant judgment, US judges acquitted Matthew Connolly, 56, from New Jersey and Gavin Black, 52, from Twickenham, Middlesex. The court ruled that their conduct was not against the rules. It means that what has been prosecuted as interest rate rigging in the UK is not regarded as a crime in the US. The US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled that it was not against the rules to seek to influence the estimates a bank submits of the cost of borrowing cash. That directly contradicts a key British appeal court ruling that was used to prosecute 24 traders, nine of whom were jailed between 2015 and 2019. 'They wanted to jail a banker - I was that banker' âIâm being jailed for four emails from 12 years agoâ For Mr Connolly and Mr Black, it's the end of an eight-year struggle to prove that what they were accused of was not criminal. The evidence against Matt Connolly was just four emails from 14 years ago, asking for high or low interest rate estimates to be submitted. Matt Connolly told the BBC on Thursday he was ""speechless"" to have won in court for the first time. ""My family and I are very thankful this ordeal is finally ending, and that the courts have finally recognised once and for all my innocence,"" he said. ""I am hoping the rest of the story emerges so others that have been denied justice get their peace as well."" ""The nine trials on both sides of the Atlantic have been a whole series of miscarriages of justice where innocent people were jailed who had done nothing wrong. ""The only Libor 'rigging' that was really bad was the lowballing. That was ordered from the top - from central banks and governments. And neither the Department of Justice nor the Serious Fraud Office has ever brought that to trial."" The evidence against Mr Connolly was only four emails that he had sent 12 years previously.

Warning over lack of vaccines for poorer countries,"The World Health Organization wanted 40% of the world fully vaccinated by the end of 2021 Scientists have warned the government that allowing large numbers of people in lower-income countries to go unvaccinated is ""reckless"" and could lead to new Covid variants. More than 320 experts have written,externalto Prime Minister Boris Johnson, calling for urgent action. They say more than three billion people globally have not had a first dose. The government said it was working to tackle underlying issues to ensure developing nations had vaccines. Many in the UK have had three doses and more than 90% of over-12s have had at least one shot. In their letter, the experts argue that the Omicron variant is a stark warning of the dangers posed by global vaccine inequality. Jabs can help keep infections low, giving the virus fewer opportunities to mutate. They are asking ministers to support moves to waive the intellectual property rights on Covid vaccines, so that developing countries can manufacture their own versions. Some 13 scientists who sit on the UK government's scientific advisory committee, Sage, have also signed it. Covid vaccines: How fast is progress around the world? What will tomorrow's Covid vaccines be like? So far the UK and the EU have opposed the temporary lifting of patents on Covid-19 vaccines. The US surprised the world by supporting the move in May 2021 and the World Health Organization (WTO) is also in favour. Former NHS chief executive Lord Crisp was one of the letter's authors and said vaccinating the world was the best way to keep the health service safe. ""The solution is global solidarity - working together and that means partnership,"" he said. ""It means - in the short term - releasing some of these patents in order to deal with this pandemic. I think the UK could take a massive lead on this. It's done very well on vaccination and has the most fantastic science base."" The UK government's main strategy for global vaccine access has been to donate excess doses. Last summer, the UK pledged to give 100 million doses by mid-2022, and so far has donated 23 million to poorer countries. The pharmaceutical industry says it's in favour of equitable access to vaccines, but argues that if patents are lifted it would remove the incentive for the private sector to invest in research and development. Richard Torbett, chief executive of the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry, said: ""A rapid scale up in manufacturing involving 335 global partnerships means production reached 11.2 billion vaccines last year and is now at 1.1 billion vaccines per month. ""As acknowledged by the WHO, the issue is not production constraints, it is how we effectively distribute and administer those doses."" However, groups such as Global Justice Now, which helped organise this letter, argue that vast sums of public money were pumped into the efforts to find Covid vaccines. South Africa and India are among the countries which have been pushing for a change to WTO rules to allow low and middle-income countries to manufacture their own versions of the vaccines, but consensus from all member states is usually required for such amendments. Separately, there are worries that the push to vaccinate the world may lack the necessary funding. Covax - the global programme to distribute vaccines to poorer countries - admitted to the Financial Times earlier this week it was running out of cash. It says it may not be able to administer any more vaccines donated by richer countries if it can't afford to buy vital accessories such as syringes. So far Covax has delivered more than one billion vaccines. A government spokesperson said the UK's ""significant early commitment"" to the Covax programme had helped to deliver these vaccines. The spokesperson added: ""We recognise and share concerns regarding the level of vaccination in some parts of the world, and we are working on tackling the underlying issues including manufacturing and supply constraints, pressure on health systems, and vaccine confidence.""

NI protocol deal 'must work for everyone',"Liz Truss said progress was being made in talks with the EU Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has said she wants to strike a deal on the Brexit Protocol that works for everyone in Northern Ireland. Ms Truss was speaking in Belfast after meeting business and political leaders to discuss the protocol. The DUP has repeated itsthreat to withdraw from Stormontif the UK and EU do not reach a solution in the coming weeks. Ms Truss said she hopes to make ""significant progress"" by February. ""What I want to do is sort out the protocol, working with the EU to protect the Belfast/Good Friday Agreement and that we protect political stability in Northern Ireland as well as making sure we deliver for the people of Northern Ireland,"" she said. ""What I want is a deal that works for everyone. ""We are making progress, we're having constructive talks, I want to make significant progress by February. ""That's important, but it's also important that we secure the support of all of the communities in Northern Ireland, including the unionist community."" The government has been attempting to renegotiate the Northern Ireland Protocol, a deal it made with the EU in 2019. Currently, the protocol keeps Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods, which led to new obligations on businesses when importing goods from Great Britain. Unionist politicians oppose the protocol, saying it undermines Northern Ireland's position within the UK. The foreign secretary said people need to be able to get access to the same goods in Northern Ireland that they can in Great Britain. ""I completely understand the frustration people feel have and the need for rapid progress and that is why we are in intense negotiations with the EU to sort out the very real issues,"" she said. What is the Northern Ireland Protocol? Paul Givan has been first minister of Northern Ireland since June 2021 After speaking to Ms Truss, NI First Minister Paul Givan said he hoped he would still be first minister next week, but warned the DUP would soon have to act over the Northern Ireland Protocol if the government does not. Speaking at Stormont, Mr Givan said his party had made it clear to Ms Truss that it would have to act, if there was no indication of any changes when the UK and EU joint committee meets on 21 February. It is the formal body overseeing the protocol but has not met in more than six months. The first minister said the protocol had caused political and economic instability which needed to be dealt with. ""The UK government wants to get progress by 21 February, they've said that's a significant date for them - what I'm saying is that the executive needs to be here to deliver on a whole range of issues. ""There are consequences the public does not want to see, which is why we need to make progress,"" Mr Givan added. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill, of Sinn FÃ©in who also met Ms Truss on Thursday, said the DUP threat was ""undermining politics"". Ms O'Neill said any concept of a new deadline in the negotiations was a ""moveable feast"". ""What remains consistent is that the DUP is undermining politics and undermining everyone else's ability to deliver a budget, to tackle waiting lists and to bring forward all the other pieces of legislation that are coming to an end point,"" she added. The Northern Ireland Assembly is due to be dissolved at the end of March for the next election in May. There are a number of pieces of legislation which have yet to complete their passage. If the DUP was to withdraw the first minister from the executive, Ms O'Neill would also be removed from her post as deputy first minister as the roles are joint. The executive would be unable to meet, as it is co-chaired by the first and deputy first ministers. The government, however, has almost finished its consideration of a so-called ""safety net bill"" that would prevent an immediate collapse of the assembly and allow outstanding legislation at Stormont to proceed into law, ahead of the election. It is thought it will have received royal assent by mid-February. Talks over the protocol came as a DUP move to force an executive rethink over Irish Sea border checks was blocked by Sinn FÃ©in. New post-Brexit checks at Northern Ireland ports began in January 2021 Agriculture Minister Edwin Poots, from the DUP, submitted documents seeking executive support for the checks on Tuesday, ahead of a legal challenge by loyalist blogger Jamie Bryson. Mr Poots argued the challenge made clear that checks must be approved by all ministers as they are controversial and cut across various departments. Sinn FÃ©in maintained Stormont has a legal obligation to enforce the checks, and that the executive agreed in May 2020 to designate Mr Poots' department to perform the controls. It is thought Mr Poots could next week outline a plan to order his officials to stop the checks. Mr Givan said his party colleague was completely entitled to issue a ministerial instruction to the civil service. ""Politicians have a democratic mandate, civil servants don't and absolutely they would have to follow the democratic instruction of a minister. ""Not to do that would have profound implications in terms of how the civil service operates."" Mr Pootshad threatened to order his officials to stop the checks, if the paper was blocked. Edwin Poots has threatened to halt Irish Sea border checks But Finance Minister Conor Murphy, of Sinn FÃ©in, said discussions were ongoing and would not be resolved ""by bringing down the assembly and executive"". ""If this is an attempt to ratchet up and precipitate a crisis it's reckless behaviour,"" he said. ""We are trying to get a budget together to support health and there is legislation going through the assembly for a whole range of issues. ""This is about the election, make no mistake, but to jeopardise all of that because they want to try and generate some type of electoral advantage for themselves is highly cynical and does a disservice to the public who need our support.""

Australia's A$1bn reef plan draws mixed response,"The Great Barrier Reef is one of the world's most biodiverse ecosystems Australia will spend A$1bn (Â£520m; $700m) over nine years on improving the water quality and other aspects of the ailing Great Barrier Reef, its PM says. Scientists have welcomed the money but warn it does not tackle the reef's overriding threat of climate change. A climate laggard among rich nations, Australia is often criticised for not doing more to prevent coral bleaching caused by warmer seas. PM Scott Morrison argued the new investment would have broad benefits. It will fund projects that reduce erosion and pollutants entering the sea, and other conservation efforts - such as combating illegal fishing and coral-eating starfish. ""There are 64,000 jobs that depend on that reef,"" Mr Morrison said on Friday. ""And so its health is about the economic health of that region, as well as the natural health of that region."" Mr Morrison is expected to call a general election in May and will hope to retain key seats in Queensland, where the reef is located. He said the new money added to A$2bn in existing commitments. But Friday's announcement also comes days before Australia is due to update Unesco on its plans to preserve its natural wonder. Last year the government successfully lobbied to keep the reef off Unesco's official list of World Heritage sites ""in danger"", drawing controversy after unprecedented back-to-back coral bleaching events. Why is the Great Barrier Reef in trouble? Renewed criticism followed Friday's announcement. The Australian Conservation Foundation said improving water quality was important ""but without climate action the reef is doomed"". The Australian Marine Conservation Society said tackling erosion was ""a gap that needed to be addressed"" but called on the government to ""drastically increase their climate ambition"". ""Currently areas of the Great Barrier Reef are on high alert for a major bleaching event, which is unprecedented during the La Nina weather pattern,"" it said in a statement. Bleaching occurs when under-stress corals expel the algae living within them that gives them colour and life. They can recover but only if conditions allow it. Australia has committed to reaching net zero carbon emissions, but its 2030 commitment - a 26% cut on 2005 levels - has been criticised as weak. It has defended itself by arguing it is on track to meet its commitments -a claim previously disputed by the UN- and that climate change is a global issue. Stretching over 2,300km (1,400 miles) off Australia's north-east coast, the Great Barrier Reef is one of the most biodiverse ecosystems in the world.

Apple unveils AirTag safety guide amid stalker fears,"Apple AirTag Apple has released an updated safety guide amid ongoing concerns over the company's AirTag devices. The company quietly released the safety portal on Monday. The Personal User Safety Guide offers advice on how people can keep themselves and their data safe. AirTags are designed to locate lost items using Apple's powerful 'Find My' network. They are small button-shaped items that can be attached to keys or a wallet. However, the BBC and other outlets have previously found evidence that AirTags have been misused to track people. Apple's newPersonal User Safety Guide,externaloffers support for people who are ""concerned about or experiencing technology-enabled abuse, stalking or harassment"". The guide says it offers ""step-by-step"" instructions on how users can protect themselves. Apple AirTags - 'A perfect tool for stalking' Its AirTags section shows users what to do if they are alerted to an unwanted AirTag - a notification that appears on the screen of an iPhone. It also highlights what to do if you hear or find an AirTag that doesn't belong to you. The guide shows Android users how they can download an app that will help alert users to rogue AirTags. Last week the BBC reported that several women had been notified that AirTags were tracking them without their knowledge. One woman said she found an AirTag taped to the inside of her bag.
