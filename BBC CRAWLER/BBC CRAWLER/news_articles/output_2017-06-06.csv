Attacker shot outside Paris's Notre-Dame,"This video can not be played Paris: Inside Notre-Dame during lockdown Police have shot a man who attacked an officer with a hammer outside the Notre-Dame cathedral in Paris. The man shouted ""this is for Syria"" during the attack, the interior minister said. Prosecutors have opened a terrorism investigation. The officer suffered minor injuries. The suspect was wounded in the chest when another policeman opened fire. Tourists fled for cover as the attack unfolded. Hundreds of people were in the cathedral at the time. France is in a state of emergency since attacks by jihadists in Paris killed 130 people in 2015. It is part of the US-led international coalition against IS and has conducted air strikes against militants in Syria. How France is wrestling with jihadist terror Watch:State of emergency explained The assailant on Tuesday afternoon carried kitchen knives and the identity card of an Algerian student, French Interior Minister GÃ©rard Collomb said. This video can not be played Nancy Soderberg describes being trapped inside the cathedral The man, who was being treated in hospital, has not been named. Former White House Deputy National Security Adviser Nancy Soderberg shared this picture from inside the cathedral The terrorist spotlight has swung to Britain, but no-one in France is under the illusion that the country is safe. Squads of soldiers with automatic weapons at the ready are a regular sight on the streets of Paris. France remains a favourite target for the propagandists of so-called Islamic State. What intrigues is the similar character of four recent attacks in Paris: at the Louvre in February, where a man attacked a soldier with a machete; at Orly airport in  March, where an attacker was killed after trying to take a gun from a soldier; on the Champs-ElysÃ©es last month, where a  gunman killed a policeman before himself being killed; and now this. Different from the recent UK atrocities - and the earlier French attacks in Paris and Nice - none of these recent French attacks was against random targets. They were all conducted by lone men. And they were all against clearly identified symbols of the state. As police declared the situation ""under control"", hundreds of people were being allowed to leave the cathedral. Kellyn Gorman, an American tourist, said: ""I was about to come inside [the cathedral] and heard the noise, the gunshots, turned around and saw the assailant on the ground where they had shot him."" Police have closed some streets and have asked people to stay away from the area ""It was very safe, very quickly contained."" Notre-Dame is one of the most visited tourist sites in Paris. Last year,police foiled an attack near the site. The incident comes just three days after militants used a van and knives in an attack in London which left seven dead. 20 Apr 2017- A convicted criminal who was investigated for threatening to kill police opens fire at police on the Champs Elysees in Paris, killing one and wounding two.

Saudi billionaire Adnan Khashoggi dies,"Adnan Khashoggi and his wife Lamia at an Aids research fundraising event in 2005 Saudi arms dealer Adnan Khashoggi, a billionaire businessman known for his lavish lifestyle, has died in London at the age of 82. His family said in statement that he died peacefully while being treated for Parkinson's disease. Mr Khashoggi became one of the world's richest men in the 1970s and '80s by brokering international arms deals. His parties were legendary, often lasting for days, but there was also controversy about his business. A statement from the family on Tuesday said: ""He lived his last days surrounded by his devoted family, children and grandchildren, with the same elegance, strength and dignity that characterised his remarkable life. He is survived by his wife Lamia. ""AK was a pioneer who achieved global recognition in a golden age through his extraordinary business achievements and renowned generosity. Our father understood the art of bringing people together better than anyone. ""He combined commercial acumen with an over-riding loyalty to his country, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. His work always furthered the interests of his country."" He most famously brokered arms deals between US firms and Saudi Arabia in the 1960s and '70s, when he worked closely with the Lockheed Corporation, now Lockheed Martin. Later, Mr Khashoggi represented France in its race against the UK to secure the initial $20bn al-Yamamah weapons-for-oil deal with the Saudis - a contract that still runs today. The nature of his business meant that there was always controversy, and in 1987 he appeared on the front cover of Time magazine under the headline:  ""Those Shadowy Arms Traders: Adnan Khashoggi's High Life and Flashy Deals"". He spent time in a Swiss prison in the 1980s - where he reportedly dined on gourmet food from the Schweizerhof Hotel - fighting extradition to the US after being accused of helping to conceal funds on behalf of former Philippines president Ferdinand Marcos and his shoe-loving wife, Imelda. Donald Trump bought Khashoggi's Nabila yacht and renamed it Trump Princess, seen here in 1991 The charges were reduced, and he and Mrs Marcos were eventually acquitted. Mr Khashoggi once owned one of the world's largest yachts, the 86-metre Nabila, which appeared in the James Bond film Never Say Never Again. When his business empire ran into financial difficulty, he handed the yacht to the Sultan of Brunei who sold it on to Donald Trump, now president of the US, for a reported $29m in the 1980s. In 1997, a Paris court ordered him to pay a $1.6m fine for smuggling 37 paintings into France in 1986, brought in from the US on his private jet. And in 1998, the casino at London's Ritz Hotel settled out of court its lawsuit against Mr Khashoggi for Â£8m of gambling debts. The businessman, whose late sister Samira was married to former Harrods chief Mohamed Al Fayed, was an uncle of Princess Diana's final love, Dodi Fayed. Adnan Khashoggi was the embodiment of the extraordinary riches that the petrodollar brought to his homeland, Saudi Arabia - although his fortune was made in arms deals rather than oil. Khashoggi was born in Mecca. His father's position as personal doctor to King Ibn Saud, the founder of modern Saudi Arabia, brought him into early proximity to the royal court. Through his vast reserve of contacts and a series of massive international arms deals in the 1960s, '70s and '80s, he ended up rivalling the Saudi royal family for glittering wealth and extravagance. His parties were legendary, featuring a cast of celebrities, glamorous women and fellow tycoons. But a series of scandals - political and financial -  not only tarnished his reputation but greatly diminished his fortune. He ended his days as a distant shadow of the flamboyant showman and inveterate dealmaker he once was.

Third London Bridge attacker named,"Khuram Butt, Rachid Redouane and Youssef Zaghba carried out the London Bridge attacks The third London Bridge attacker has been named as 22-year-old Youssef Zaghba, a Moroccan-Italian man. Pakistan-born Khuram Butt, 27, and  Rachid Redouane, 30, both from Barking were the other two attackers. Two more victims have been been named - Australian nurse Kirsty Boden, 28, and French national Alexandre Pigeard, 27, died in Saturday night's attack. They were among seven people killed - 48 were also injured - before the three attackers were shot dead by police. Zaghba, Butt and Redouane drove a hired van into pedestrians on London Bridge at 21:58 BST before stabbing people in the area around Borough Market. Armed officers killed all three within eight minutes of receiving a 999 call. The Metropolitan Police said Butt had been subject to an investigation in 2015, but there had been no suggestion this attack was being planned. This video can not be played Khuram Butt was shown in a documentary about extremists In other developments: Theresa May says she expects a review will be launched by the police and security services following the attack,amid an election row over police numbers The Metropolitan Police said a 27-year-old man had been arrested in Barking on Tuesday in connection with the investigation A property in Ilford, east London, was also searched by police at about 01:30 BST, but no arrests had been made, the Met said A man was arrested in Limerick, Ireland, on Tuesday over the discovery of ID documents in Redouane's name. He was later released without charge. A second man, who is in his 30s, was arrested on Tuesday evening, with the Garda saying it was also related to Redouane. He is being held in Wexford. The Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall visited injured members of the public at the Royal London Hospital NHS England said 32 people remained in hospital, with 15 in a critical condition Anational one-minute silence was held in the UKin memory of those who were killed All 12 people arrested on Sunday after the attack have now been released without charge The so-called Islamic State (IS) group has said its ""fighters"" carried out the attack. An Italian police source has confirmed to the BBC that Zaghba, who lived in east London, had been placed on a watch list, which is shared with many countries including the UK. In March 2016, Italian officers stopped Zaghba at Bologna airport and found IS-related materials on his mobile phone. He was then stopped from continuing his journey to Istanbul. Latest updates In pictures: Tributes to victims How are UK extremists radicalised? London attack: What we know so far Analysis: What new powers could be used? Redouane was a chef who also used the name Rachid Elkhdar and police said he claimed to be Moroccan-Libyan. He married a British woman in Dublin in 2012 and lived in Rathmines in the Irish capital. Butt worked as a customer services assistant at Transport for London Butt featured in a Channel 4 documentary last year about Islamist extremists with links to the jailed preacher Anjem Choudary called The Jihadis Next Door. The married father-of-two, who worked for London Underground as a trainee customer services assistant for nearly six months last year, could be seen in the programme arguing with police officers in the street, after displaying a flag used by IS in a London park. Two people in Barking, east London, had also raised concerns about Butt, BBC home affairs correspondent Dominic Casciani said. Metropolitan Police assistant commissioner Mark Rowley said an investigation into Butt began in 2015, but ""there was no intelligence to suggest that this attack was being planned and the investigation had been prioritised accordingly"". At any one time there are about 500 active counter-terrorism investigations concerning 3,000 people of interest. Who were the attackers? James McMullan, Chrissy Archibald and Kirsty Boden were all killed in the attack So far four of those killed in the attack have been named. Ms Boden worked as a senior staff nurse at Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital in London. Her family have described her in a statement as an ""outgoing, kind and generous person"". ""We are so proud of Kirsty's brave actions which demonstrate how selfless, caring and heroic she was, not only on that night, but throughout all of her life,"" they added. The hospital said that Ms Boden was ""an outstanding nurse and a hugely valued member of the staff team in Theatres Recovery, described by her colleagues as 'one in a million' who always went the extra mile for the patients in her care"". Canadian national Chrissy Archibald, 30, was the first victim to be named. Herfamily said she had died in her fiancÃ©'s armsafter being struck by the attackers' speeding van. The family of 32-year-old James McMullan, from Hackney, east London, say they believe he also died. Mr McMullan's sister said he was believed to be amongthose who died, after his bank card was found on a body at the scene. A French national was also killed in the attack, according to foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian, which the BBC understands to be Mr Pigeard. Manager of the Boro Bistro, Vincent Le Berre told the Brittany news outlet Le Telegramme how his colleague was attacked in a bar near Borough Market.

Human rights won't stop terror fight - May,"This video can not be played Theresa May says Britain's security and intelligence agencies must have the powers they need Theresa May says she will change human rights laws if they ""get in the way"" of tackling terror suspects. She said she wants to do more to restrict the freedom of those posing a threat and to deport foreign suspects. The UK could seek opt-outs from the European Convention on Human Rights, which it has abided by since 1953. Labour said the UK would not defeat terrorism ""by ripping up basic rights"". The Lib Dems said it was a ""cynical"" move ahead of Thursday's election. The Conservatives have faced criticism over police cuts and questions about intelligence failures following the terror attacks in London and Manchester. Live: Follow the latest developments in the campaign Last push for votes in election campaign Manifesto guide: What the parties are promising Speaking after Saturday's London attack, Mrs May said ""enough is enough"" and that ""things need to change"" in the terror fight. This video can not be played Nick Clegg tells Today Theresa May's comments about human rights laws aren't supported by evidence Addressing activists in Slough on Tuesday evening, she did not make any specific new policy proposals but said she envisaged longer prison sentences for those convicted of terrorist offences and making it easier for the authorities to deport foreign terrorist suspects back to their own countries. She added: ""And I mean doing more to restrict the freedom and movements of terrorist suspects when we have enough evidence to know they are a threat, but not enough evidence to prosecute them in full in court. ""And if our human rights laws get in the way of doing it, we will change the law so we can do it."" As a party to the European Convention on Human Rights, the UK is permitted under Article 15 to ""derogate"", or depart from, parts of the Convention in limited circumstances. This can only happen in ""time of emergency"", ie there must be a war or other public emergency ""threatening the life of the nation"". If that is the case, the UK can take measures derogating from its obligations, but only to the extent strictly required by the situation. Any measures must not breach the UK's other obligations under international law. The government must keep the secretary general of the Council of Europe fully informed of the measures and its reasons for imposing them. Derogation can be challenged in domestic courts and the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. The UK derogated from Article 5 of the ECHR - the right to liberty and security - during the troubles in Northern Ireland. In 1979, the European Court of Human Rights found the circumstances of Northern Ireland and the use of preventative detention of terrorist suspects without trial met the criteria for derogation. What are UK's options over human rights laws? Laura Kuenssberg: Upping the ante In an interview withThe Sun,external, Mrs May said she would also consider extending the time suspects could be held without charge to 28 days. The limit was reduced to 14 days in 2011 under the Conservative-Lib Dem coalition government. Mrs May was home secretary at the time. ""We said there may be circumstances where it is necessary to do this,"" she told the newspaper. ""I will listen to what they [the police and security services] think is necessary for us to do."" What powers do the police have? What new anti-terror powers could be used? The Conservative manifesto committed the party to remaining in the European Convention on Human Rights - which is separate to the EU and which the UK helped to establish after World War Two - for the whole of the next Parliament. Conservative sources say they would not withdraw from the ECHR but would seek temporary opt-outs called ""derogations"" from certain aspects. This video can not be played Damian Green tells Today it is possible to have derogations from the European Convention on Human Rights This could possibly include Article 5 - which guarantees individuals' rights to liberty and security and the right to a trial ""within a reasonable time"", while protecting against unlawful arrest and detention. During last year's Conservative leadership campaign, Mrs May said she personally backed leaving the ECHR, saying it made it harder to deport terror suspects and criminals. But she later said she did not believe there was enough support in Parliament for the move. The Conservatives have said they will reconsider the UK's human rights legal framework after leaving the EU but that the 1998 Human Rights Act will remain in place until that time. The party has long proposed replacing it will a British Bill of Rights. Sir Keir Starmer, the former director of public prosecutions who is now Labour's shadow Brexit secretary, told Today the Human Rights Act ""had not got ""in the way of what we were doing"" during his many years prosecuting serious crime. He warned against ""throwing away the very values that are at the heart of our democracy and everything we believe in"". Labour's leader, Jeremy Corbyn, said laws were already in place to deal with people, including foreign nationals, who presented a threat and that the government must always act ""within the law"". What is the European Convention of Human Rights? TheECHR is a treaty between the 47 Council of Europe member states,externaland is intended to protect the human rights of the 822 million people who live in its jurisdiction All European states, except for Belarus, are members of the convention. It includes right to life, prohibition of torture, slavery and forced labour, and the right to a fair trial Cases are heard in theEuropean Court of Human Rights, which was established in 1959 in Strasbourg The cases that European judges rule on include allegations of human rights abuses, discrimination, the improper conduct of trials and the mistreatment of prisoners Former Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg said the PM was making a ""very cynical"" attempt to appeal to UKIP voters, telling the BBC ""attacking the principles of human rights legislation is not the right way to keep us safe"". He denounced the ""explosive claim, free from any evidence, that the problem lies with human rights legislation"", saying the prime minister had a ""track record"" of making ""ludicrous"" claims about the impact of the laws. He said ministers' focus should be on the fact one of the London Bridge attackers had been on a Italian terror watchlist  - and whether this information was properly shared and acted upon. Linking Brexit to security, he added: ""I think we need to enhance our use of those EU-wide databases which are proving to be the most sophisticated pool of information about would-be criminals."" ""It would be illegal for 27 other countries in the European Union to share data with us if we in the future, under Theresa May's plans, rule out abiding by European Union data protection rules."" UKIP has already backed extending pre-charge detention to 28 days. Their immigration spokesman Jon Bickley said the UK had to ""stop being so tolerant of other people's intolerance"".

Dustbin man's library of discarded books,"Jose Alberto Gutierrez has rescued books from the rubbish to create a free library A dustbin man in Bogota in Colombia, who never studied further than primary school, has gathered a library of more than 20,000 thrown away books. The collection began 20 years ago, when Jose Alberto Gutierrez fished out a discarded copy of Tolstoy's novel Anna Karenina. He now offers his books to other people as a free community library. ""I realised that people were throwing books away in the rubbish. I started to rescue them,"" he said. Mr Gutierrez, who has gained the nickname The Lord of the Books, began collecting books that had been dumped in the waste bins in wealthier parts of the city. His home is filled with rescued books with plans to give many of them away He would take them out of the rubbish and retrieve them for families in poorer areas. His collection of chucked away books is now used by families wanting to help their children with their homework, in a free library called the Strength of Words. ""There was a lack of them in our neighbourhood, so we started to help,"" said Mr Gutierrez. Global education Canadian researchers' rescue for roadkill University of Birmingham to open campus in Dubai Apple expands European academy to tackle digital skills gap Get in touch with Sean Coughlan (sean.coughlan@bbc.co.uk) with any ideas. His home has been overfilled with books, so they are now taking books to poor parts of the city or to remote areas without any access to libraries. ""The more books we give away, the more come to us,"" he said. He has also been providing books for fighters being demobilised in Colombia's peace process. Books were taken from the bins of rich families and then rescued for poor families A fighter from the Farc rebel group contacted him about getting books to help them prepare for jobs when they re-enter civilian life. ""Books transformed me, so I think books are a symbol of hope for those places. They are a symbol of peace,"" said Mr Gutierrez.

Over the course of the campaign the gap between the main two parties narrowed but, with one exception, the final polls all suggested a clearer Conservative lead than the actual outcome. Read more from Peter Barnes Nearly all the final polls are now out. Ipsos Mori will publish on Thursday and ICM are expected to update their preliminary figures from earlier today. Apart from that, we're there. What should we take from them? First, it's worth making the obvious point that every single poll throughout the campaign has put the Conservative Party ahead. If Labour receives more votes tomorrow it will be a bigger polling failure than in 2015. Manifesto guide: Where the parties stand How the BBC reports polling day How to follow results night and what to watch for Second, the range of vote shares for the parties in polls published on Tuesday and Wednesday are CON 41-46%, LAB 34-40%, LD 7-10%, and UKIP 2-5%. Not all the polls separate out the SNP, Plaid Cymru or Green Party. We've looked a lot at the gap between the two top parties - arguably too much. But the polls suggest it could be anywhere between a one and 12-point Conservative lead, with Survation suggesting the closest result. That suggests anything from a small swing to Labour to a 2-3% swing to the Conservatives. And it's doubly difficult to estimate how that could play out in terms of the number of seats each party wins. So much will depend on variations in different parts of the country and in different types of constituency. There could be no national swing between Conservatives and Labour but still a significant shift in seats. The BBC/ITV/Sky exit poll will be published at 10pm on Thursday, when polls close. It would be an understatement to say it's eagerly awaited. The final polls in Scotland suggest a fairly settled picture - although there have only been seven of them during the whole campaign so there's not much to go on. The SNP are clearly out in front on 40% or a little higher. The Conservatives and Labour are in a battle for second place at around 25%, perhaps with the Conservatives' ahead by a nose. That would represent a significant shift from the actual 2015 result of SNP 50%, LAB 24%, CON 15%. In Wales, YouGov are the only company to have produced polls throughout the campaign so we have even less evidence. Their last, released on Wednesday, showed little change from the previous two. Labour remain on 46% and the Conservatives fall back one point to 34%. Plaid Cymru are on 9% with both the Lib Dems and UKIP on 5%. That implies a modest swing to Labour with UKIP losing well over half their 2015 votes. Three polls have been published since the weekend - by Opinium, Survation and ICM. None of them showed dramatic changes from what they'd had before. The race is still very close according to Survation - their phone poll showed similar figures to their weekend internet poll - but the Conservatives have a handsome lead according to ICM. Opinium's poll (CON 43, LAB 36, LD 8, UKIP 5, SNP 5, GRN 2) was their last of the campaign. Lots of other polls are expected today. We should have final figures from ComRes, ICM, Kantar Public and YouGov. Others are possible as well. We'll update the poll tracker as they are released. Ipsos Mori are expected to publish their final figures on Thursday. That won't get added to the BBC poll tracker because ofeditorial guidelines,external, which state that no opinion poll on any issue relating to the election can be published on polling day. Get the latest news in your inbox, each weekday morning,external The normal array of Saturday night polls have been published - six in total. All of them still have the Conservatives in the lead but by a widely-varying degree. The gap over Labour ranges from just one point in Survation's poll to 12 points according to ComRes. Clearly, the discrepancies between the polling companies are very large. And that obviously makes it hard to draw firm conclusions. Survation's poll has the narrowest gap of any poll so far during the campaign. It's the only company that has not changed its methodology since 2015. But up to now they've not been especially favourable to Labour. Their poll was conducted today, after last night's Question Time special, where Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn faced questions from a live audience. And they found that more people who watched the programme said it made them more likely to vote Labour than Conservative. It's very unclear whether this could really have caused a significant shift though. A further complication is that most of Survation's polls in this campaign have been conducted by phone. This was an internet poll so it makes comparisons with their previous figures harder. Ipsos MORI also published a poll on Friday with a Conservative lead of 5%. In addition to the voting intention numbers, they reported a dramatic change in attitudes towards the two main party leaders. Since she became Prime Minister, Theresa May has always enjoyed positive approval figures - more people have said that they are satisfied with her performance than dissatisfied. But in their latest poll she has slumped to a negative overall figure of -7% (43% satisfied, 50% dissatisfied). Meanwhile, Jeremy Corbyn's rating has shot up. He's still in negative territory and, on -11%, still behind Theresa May. But that contrasts with -41% in March, before the election was called. Other pollsters have seen a similar trend. ComRes have also reported Theresa May's first negative negative rating (-3%). Opinium put Jeremy Corbyn on -12%, up from -35% at the start of the campaign. Theresa May has fallen to +6%. For ORB tonight's poll will be their last of the campaign. Their final figures are CON 45%, LAB 36%, LD 8% and UKIP 4%. Other companies will be publishing further polls in the final week of the campaign though. YouGov have also been updating their seat projection - that should also continue in the coming days. After their striking seat projection published last night, YouGov has a new poll this evening which has the narrowest gap between the main two parties so far during the campaign. It has the Conservatives on 42% and Labour on 39% - their highest rating in any poll since 2014. It's not all good news for Labour though. Kantar Public also published a poll on Wednesday with a slightly increased Conservative lead compared to their previous poll. They now have the Conservatives on 43% and Labour on 33%. Its not the only company which still shows a large gap. In fact, it's more than 10% according to ICM and ComRes. The main reason for this disparity is the different ways that the pollsters estimate turnout. Polling companies are sometimes accused of ""herding"" - manipulating their figures so they all say the same thing. Nobody could accuse them of that at this election. If anything, the differences have become more stark as we approach election day. Scotland There was also a rare Scottish poll published on Wednesday afternoon. The SNP, on 43%, maintained the commanding lead that they've had throughout the campaign and for a long time before that. More interesting was that Labour and the Conservatives were on level pegging at 25%. That's the first time this year that the Conservatives haven't been in a clear second place. As with the other nations, though, it's hard to draw conclusions when there have been so few polls. The polls covered in the BBC tracker are standard voting intention polls. That is, they try to gauge levels of support for each of the parties across the country. They do not attempt to say how many seats each party would win. There's a good reason for that. The first-past-the-post electoral system means that there is no straightforward relationship between votes and seats won. The 2017 election could be almost a repeat of the 2015 result in terms of vote share but produce a very different outcome in terms of the number of MPs returned for each party. Clearly, though, people are interested in knowing how votes might translate into seats. SoYouGov,externalhave attempted to model how that could work. Their projection of a hung parliament has, understandably, caused a stir. The model used to make this projection is complicated. It's not based on a single poll, but on the responses of 50,000 people who have taken part in other YouGov polls. Nor does it work by just counting up how the respondents in each constituency said they would vote. Even with 50,000 people there wouldn't be nearly enough to have a reliable sample in each of the 650 constituencies in the UK. Instead, it uses demographic information about the people who take part in the polls, as well as information about where they live and how they've voted before, to try to work out how different types of people are likely to vote. Then it looks at the demographic make-up of each constituency and comes up with an estimate of the likely outcome. YouGov themselves have indicated that their projection is subject to quite a lot of uncertainty. And Stefan Shakespeare, the company's Chief Executive, has said that it would only take a small shift in favour of the Conservatives to see them win a healthy Conservative majority. So it should definitely be treated with caution. Wales update There's been no shortage of Britain-wide polls but in the individual nations it's a different story. With so few polls focused on the election in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland it's impossible to identify any well-supported trends. That said, there has been one Welsh poll since I last mentioned them which showed a very different picture from the two that had gone before. YouGov gave Labour a 10 point lead in Wales whereas previously they'd shown a clear Conservative advantage. The direction of shift is consistent with what we've seen in the national polls but it's very difficult to know what to make of the particular numbers. It's a huge turnaround and we really would need more evidence before drawing any firm conclusions. Five polls have been published this evening. Overall, they reinforce Thursday night's polls which suggested that the Conservative lead over Labour has shrunk again since last weekend but there are quite large differences between the pollsters' figures. ICM and ComRes have a larger gap between the two main parties than the other companies. They put it at 14% and 12% respectively but that's still down from what they were showing two weeks ago. The others have it at 6%-10%. There will no doubt be some talk about the fact that Labour has dropped two points in YouGov's poll compared to the one they published on Thursday. But that still means that the gap is narrower than they found last weekend and it would be unwise to read too much into a small change between two individual polls. The general trend is clear. The Conservatives are still ahead but Labour has closed the gap. Is the shift believable? The godfather of psephology or the study of elections, Sir David Butler, said this week that the movement in the polls over this campaign is bigger than in any election he's covered since 1945. But many experts think that election campaigns don't make much difference - voters' views are set years or months before polling day. So does that mean the polls must be wrong? Not necessarily. Voters have become much more volatile than they used to be - much less loyal to a single party. Chris Prosser and Jane Green from theBritish Election Study,externalhave shown that over the last 50 years the proportion of voters who switch parties between elections has risen from around 15% in the 1960s and 1970s to 43% in 2015. We can't be sure that the same will happen this time and many of the people who do switch might have made up their minds before the campaign started. It's also possible that people who said they were going to switch at the start of the campaign have gone back to the party they supported before. But if voters are more likely to change allegiance than in the past then perhaps we shouldn't be too surprised if the polls show large movements. How reliable is Labour's vote? One reason for caution about Labour's advance is that their improved polling numbers are based on very high levels of support among young voters and people who didn't vote in 2015. A big part of the problem with the polls in 2015 was that they failed to estimate accurately the difference in turnout rates among different groups of voters. In particular, they underestimated the turnout gap between young and old voters. As I've mentioned before, many of the pollsters have adjusted their methods to try to overcome this problem. But concerns remain about whether the people who say they'll vote Labour will actually do so on 8 June. If they don't then Labour's vote share could be lower than the polls suggest. Two new polls published on Thursday night suggest a further continuation of the trend we've seen throughout the campaign so far. The gap between the Conservatives and Labour has narrowed again. It's down to eight points in Kantar Public's poll and just five points in YouGov's - smaller than the actual gap between the parties at the 2015 election. The Manchester attack has, rightly, meant that the country's attention has been focused away from the election. But as the campaign resumes, it's inevitable that people will ask whether it's had an effect on how people might vote. So it's important to note that Kantar Public's poll was conducted before the attack, but YouGov's was done afterwards - on Wednesday and Thursday. That doesn't mean we can say that the latest shift is related to the attack. Theresa May has consistently had a strong lead over Jeremy Corbyn on the issues of defence and security. That hasn't changed. YouGov found that 55% of respondents trusted Theresa May to make the right decisions to keep Britain safe from terrorism compared to just 33% who trusted Jeremy Corbyn. It's possible that the polls are still reacting to the fallout of the manifesto launches last week - and the revisions to the Conservatives' social care plans announced on Monday (they denied it was a U-turn). There could also just be an element of natural polling variation. Whatever the cause, the important thing to remember is to look at the general trend rather than concentrating too much on individual polls. The Conservatives retain a clear lead over Labour but the gap has closed significantly. After the week of the manifesto launches for the main GB-wide parties, the trend of Labour improvement that we've seen throughout the campaign is continuing. In fact, four polls released on Saturday, for the Sunday papers, suggest that the Labour advance has strengthened. And, while the Lib Dems and UKIP are still below where they were when the election was announced, for the first time it looks as though the latest Labour rise is coming at the expense of the Conservatives. The Conservative lead was generally around 20 points or a little above in the middle of April. It's down to between 9 and 13 points in today's polls. As ever, the figures should be treated with caution. It's particularly worth noting that none of the most recent polls come from the companies that tend to put Labour on a lower figure. ICM and Kantar Public both make adjustments based on turnout rates for different groups of people at previous elections. They've had Labour at a lower level than some of the other companies throughout the campaign. So it will be interesting to see whether their next polls follow a similar pattern. Looking beneath the voting intention figures there are some clues about what might be causing the shift towards Labour that we've seen. One is voters' responses to the manifestos. For example, Survation found that nearly half of respondents opposed Conservative plans for changes to the system of funding for social care. By contrast, Labour's plan to increase income tax for people earning over Â£80,000 was backed by more than six out of ten people and opposed by under a quarter. Jeremy Corbyn has also seen an improvement in his approval ratings although he still lags a long way behind Theresa May. For example, Opinium have him on a net figure of -18 this week, up from -28 last week. Despite the significant moves we should still remember that the Conservatives retain a large lead by historical standards. If today's polls were repeating on 8 June it would be the biggest gap between the two parties since Tony Blair's landslide in 1997 in terms of share of the vote. There's also some evidence in the polls that the Labour vote is ""softer"" than the Conservative vote. In other words, more Labour voters than Conservative voters say they might change their minds. Four polls over the weekend reinforced the picture of aLabourimprovement during the course of the campaign so far. ORB, Opinium, ComRes and YouGov all had them at 30% or above - clearly above the levels seen at around the time the election was announced. However, this increase has not come at the expense of theConservativeswho remain in the mid-to-high 40s with a commanding lead. The main losers have beenUKIP, who are down in the 3-6% range. If the current polls were reflected in the final result it would mean the two main parties between them capturing a significantly larger share of the vote than at recent elections. In 2015, they received a total of 69%. The polls suggest a joint share of almost 80%. You have to go back to 1992 to find an election where the total Conservative and Labour share was close to that - the figure was 78%. The last time it was above 80% was 1979. All the polls shown in the tracker report vote intention share across Great Britain, but that's not very helpful for working out what's going on in parts of the UK where other parties stand. However as we've only seen two campaign polls in Scotland, two in Wales and one in Northern Ireland so far, there's not very much evidence to go on. Having said that, both of the Scottish polls, conducted by Survation and YouGov, have given theSNPover 40% with a clear lead over the Conservatives on 28% and Labour down in third place on 18%. In Wales, two YouGov polls have put the Conservatives ahead of Labour, but with a smaller gap than across Britain as a whole. Like in the national polls, Labour's share has seen an improvement from the beginning of the campaign.Plaid Cymruare back in third place In Northern Ireland, the single Lucid Talk poll gave theDUPa narrow lead overSinn Feinwith theUUP,SDLPand theAllianceall some way back. As well as asking people which party they intend to vote for, pollsters also ask which issues are the most important. In 2015 the three biggest issues were theNHS,immigrationandthe economy. A significant change at this election is the emergence ofBrexit. Polls conducted since the election was called have put it at the top of the list of important issues ahead of theNHSin second place with the economy and immigration battling it out for third. This may help to explain, at least in part, the Conservatives' lead in the polls. So far as we can tell, they've managed to attract the support of a large number of new voters who backed leave at last year's referendum whilst holding on to most of their own supporters who backed remain - many of whom now think that the Government has a duty to implement the outcome of the referendum. As everybody knows, the polls got the 2015 general election wrong. They suggested that the likely outcome was a hung parliament but, as we know, the Conservatives won an overall majority. So is it worth paying attention to them this time? Well, we certainly shouldn't assume that the result will be exactly what the polls say. But that doesn't mean they're completely useless. For one thing, critics have perhaps exaggerated other polling ""disasters"". The belief that the polls were just as bad at the EU referendum and in the US Presidential election is widely held. However, whilst some polls gave a misleading picture at the referendum, others were pretty close. We reported at the timethat the polls overall indicated a very narrow race in the weeks running up to referendum day. Similarly, at the US election,the national polls weren't that far offin terms of the share of the vote won by Donald Trump and Hilary Clinton - Clinton actually won the popular vote by over 2%. It was state polls that were unreliable and led to a misleading impression as to who would emerge from the Electoral College system as president. In both cases, if all we'd taken from the polls was that the votes would be close, we would have been on the right lines. The polling companies have also made adjustments to try to prevent the problems of 2015 from happening again and to resolve issues that arose at the referendum. These methodological changes vary from pollster to pollster but there are some general trends. Several of them now ask the people who take part about their educational background. The aim, as with questions about class, age, gender and region is to get a sample of people who are representative of the population as a whole. Others have developed more sophisticated ways to estimate how likely it is that somebody who takes part in a poll will actually vote. Just asking people whether they will vote is not a good guide. Of course, we can't be sure whether these adjustments will make the polls more accurate. So some people will no doubt decide to ignore them all together. But there's still clearly an appetite for them. No fewer than 30 have been conducted since the Prime Minister made her surprise announcement on 18 April. That's more than one a day. General election: What you need to know It's now three weeks since the election was announced and the official campaign is well under way. After Theresa May's surprise statement, the Conservatives saw their poll rating jump with several polls suggesting a comfortable 20 point lead. Since then, nothing very dramatic has happened. There has been a modest uptick for Labour, who are generally up to the high 20s or around 30 - up from the mid 20s just after the announcement. But that still leaves a very large gap between the main two parties. UKIP seem to have slipped a little further down and perhaps the Lib Dems have also fallen back a bit, although these trends are not clear. Most opinion polls, and all of the ones covered in the BBC poll tracker, are either conducted by telephone or online. For phone polls the polling company rings up landline and mobile numbers. In principle, anyone with a phone could be asked to participate. For internet polls, the company maintains a panel of people who are prepared to take part. For each poll they will contact the required number of panel members. In both cases the company will aim to survey a sample of people who are representative of the country as a whole - in terms of age, gender, social class, etc. They will generally then apply weighting adjustments if one or other group is over-represented or under-represented in their sample. It's also common to seek a representative sample or apply a weighting based on past-voting behaviour.

New pictures of bloodied Aleppo boy,"Journalist Khaled Iskef took a selfie with Omran Daqneesh (2nd left) and his family New pictures have emerged of Omran Daqneesh, the young Syrian boy who became a symbol of civilian suffering in the city of Aleppo last year. A bloodied Omran was filmed after what activists said was an air strike on a rebel enclave that killed his brother. On Sunday, he was photographed at his new home in the city, which is now under full government control. Ininterviews,externalwith pro-government journalists, Omran's father complained that he had been used as ""propaganda"". The image of Omran sitting in an ambulance sparked international compassion Mohammed Daqneeshtold,externala reporter from Iran's Al-Alam TV that the Syrian opposition and international media had wanted to use Omran to attack President Bashar al-Assad. ""They wanted to trade in his blood and published his photos,"" he added. Outrage at bloodied Aleppo boy photo Mr Daqneesh said he had been sitting with his then five-year-old son when their home was hit on 17 August and that he had not heard a plane overhead. He added that Omran had suffered only minor injuries and that the blood on his son's face had dripped on to him from one of his own wounds. Omran Daqneesh's home was destroyed As he searched for his three other children among the rubble, ""gunmen"" took Omran to an ambulance in the street outside and started filming him, Mr Daqneesh said. They then took him to hospital despite there being no need, he added. Video footageof Omran being carried from a damaged building and being placed on a seat in the back of an ambulance by an unarmed man who appeared to be a rescue worker was filmed by the pro-opposition Aleppo Media Centre (AMC), after what it said was a series of overnight Russian air strikes on the Qaterji district. A doctor at the hospital where Omran was taken told the BBC at the time that he had a head wound that required stitches and was suffering from shock. When troops pushed into eastern Aleppo at the end of last year, Mr Daqneesh and his family reportedly chose to cross into government-controlled territory along with thousands of other civilians, rather than be evacuated to rebel-held Idlib province.

Teacher sought for single-pupil school,"A new head teacher is being sought for a single pupil school on a Scottish island described as being on the edge of the world. Jayne Smith is leaving Foula Primary, in Shetland, after three-and-a-half years in the post. The job is beingadvertised with a salary of Â£49,133,externaland rented three-bedroom accommodation is available. The closing date is Thursday and there has been interest from as far afield as South Africa and Azerbaijan. Foula, about 20 miles west of the Shetland Mainland, is one of the UK's most remote inhabited islands and has a population of just 32. It was the location for the 1937 Michael Powell film The Edge of the World. Departing Jayne Smith, pictured by a pupil The school currently has two pupils but one is leaving for high school in Lerwick at the end of the current term. Ms Smith, 38, told BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland: ""I have loved my time on Foula, it has just been amazing. ""Most of the time I have been there we have actually had just one pupil. ""He has been in the upper stages of primary, so we have been able to go and visit Fair Isle, we have had lots of trips to the Mainland, it has just been brilliant."" Of her decision to leave in October, she said: ""When I came I was initially going to do two years, I thought it would look good on my CV, and then of course I got caught up with being there. ""But I feel it is time to go and get back to the mainland, because I miss the little things like.....roads, proper roads, being able to get the car into fifth gear. If you get it out of second on Foula you're doing really good."" And of the type of person suited to the post, the departing teacher said: ""To be quite honest, the job is only a small part of it, it's got to be someone who's so adaptable and able to live in an isolated area. ""We can be cut off from the mainland for, I think the longest time while I have been there has been three weeks that we have had no ferry and no plane. ""You have to be really resilient. ""We want somebody special who is coming in enthusiastic with new ideas and who is going to love living on Foula.""

Laura KuenssbergBBC political editor Asked about the scale of challenge facing the government, Laura Kuenssberg says: ""It's not a very tempting inbox. ""A lot of people are anxious - living standards, wages are sluggish, there are huge uncertainties around the world, whoever is in charge will have to watch the pennies carefully. ""Above all the other issues, how will they take us out of the EU? Whoever ends up in Number 10 will be the one negotiator up against 27 other countries. ""The deal they get - or don't get - will shape our future for decades."" Laura KuenssbergBBC political editor BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg says: ""In many ways it does remind us of a kind of politics that went some time ago because the gulf between the two main parties - between Labour and the Tories  - is the biggest contrast we have seen for many years. ""It is a wide choice and we've seen people around the country responding to that. Whatever the result, in the last few elections we have seen a splintering of the control of the main two parties. ""But I suspect we will see the biggest share for the two main parties that we've seen for quite some time - a return for the two ""tribes"" is something that has developed over the last couple of weeks. ""There's a sense of something quite retro about this campaign even in this 21st Century volatility. ""Labour have had a better time than was expected. Watching both parties on the road today, the Tories appeared to have recovered some of their sheen of their early self-confidence."" Tim Farron goes on to tell the Oxford rally that if you vote for Theresa May she will assume ""you meant you are OK with the dementia tax, with schools sacking teachers, with cripplingly low police numbers"". He says: ""If you are someone who has traditionally voted Conservative and you're not OK with that, vote Lib Dem.

Mr Corbyn returns to his message that politics is about a choice - to re-elect a Tory government which will continue austerity and continue the tax relief and giveaways to the richest in our society. The Labour government will do things very differently, he says, repeating a pledge that 95% will pay no more in taxes and 5% will be asked to pay a little bit more. Voting Labour tomorrow is voting to look at things the other way round, he continues. For the interests of all of the people, not the very few, he adds, almost drowned out by cheering supporters.

'Significant evidence' in bomber's car,"Pictures of Abedi's Nissan Micra have been released by Greater Manchester Police Manchester suicide bomber Salman Abedi may have used items stored in his car ""to help assemble the device"" he used to kill, police have said. The white Nissan Micra wasseized from Devell Housein Rusholme on Friday. Det Ch Supt Russ Jackson said Abedi made ""repeated trips"" to and from the car between 18 and 22 May, the day of his attack. Meanwhile, police have arrested a man at Heathrow Airport in London in connection with the Manchester bombing. The 38-year-old was apprehended in what police described as a ""planned"" operation on suspicion of ""offences contrary to the Terrorism Act"". Greater Manchester Police said ""there was no direct threat to the airport"". Manchester attack: What we know so far Manchester attack: The victims Police have asked people to try and remember if they saw Abedi with the holdall Abedi's attack at Manchester Arena following an Ariana Grande concert killed 22 people. Greater Manchester Police have released images of the car and a holdall found inside in the hope it will help people recall Abedi's movements between 13 and 15 April, the day he left the UK for Libya, and 18 and 22 May. ""We need to know who was in the car and where the car went,"" Det Ch Supt Jackson said. ""We know Abedi bought some of the parts of the device after landing back in the UK and although his final acts on the night seem to have been alone, this doesn't mean that he did not have support in planning this attack. ""It is vital that we exhaust all our lines of inquiry to establish how this was planned and understand how others might have been involved."" He added forensic examiners had found ""significant evidence"" in the vehicle. Abedi's car was seized during an operation which saw a 100m cordon established in Rusholme Det Ch Supt Jackson said the investigation had made ""significant progress"". ""We have made more arrests and have corroborated the accounts of some people we have released."" However, he said police still wanted to hear from Abedi's ""close associates"" to help ""build a picture of exactly what led to this atrocity"". Nineteen people, including the man held at Heathrow, have been arrested over the bombing - 12 have been released without charge. A 33-year-old man was released earlier after being arrested in Wigan on 24 May, Greater Manchester Police said. An 18-year-old man arrested on the same day in the Fallowfield area was also released on Tuesday. Seven men remain in custody.

'My father was kidnapped yesterday',"Lina spends her days calling contacts in Libya trying to get news about her father Kidnapping has become a growing problem in Libya, where three governments and several militia are vying for power. The BBC's North Africa correspondent Rana Jawad has been talking to people personally affected. ""My father was kidnapped yesterday."" Not quite the text message you expect to get from a close friend on a Friday morning.  I called to confirm that it was not a cruel auto-correction and rushed over to her place. She looked remarkably composed but exhausted. Here, in the comfort and safety of neighbouring Tunisia, the insecurities engulfing Libya seem like a galaxy away. She gets another call, and another, about a dozen in less than an hour. She stands, frowning, and clutching the phone, trying to make sense of what was being communicated to her.  She paces, kicks the kitchen chair, and eventually sits down calmly again. Salem Beitelmal has been missing for more than a month In post-revolution Libya, either armed gangs or semi-official militias kidnap people. The motives vary, from ransom, to revenge, to politics but the devastation and helplessness that the victims' families experience is the same. I saw this first-hand through my friend, Lina (not her real name). Her 68-year-old diabetic father, university professor Salem Beitelmal, was abducted. Six weeks on, the family is still not entirely sure which armed group took him or why.  But they have learned that his car was found abandoned on the side of a road, west of the Libyan capital, Tripoli. Official statistics are not available but many Libyans I know have either first-hand experience of being kidnapped or have had a family member or friend abducted. Most families do not speak out, fearing that if they go public their loved ones will be killed or tortured in captivity. So what happens after a kidnapping? The power vacuum in Libya means that in case of an emergency, you call a friend, a neighbour, and every local militia under the Libyan sun. Numerous rival militia groups are vying for power in Libya Over the past month, I have watched Lina agonize over an investigation that often entails talking to people she mistrusts. The family has a pool of contacts she is calling, but they are strangers. At times, she looked like she was going around in circles and slowly being sucked into a vortex of misinformation. ""You don't have institutions that you can turn to that are there to protect and serve the citizens. So the reality then becomes that it is the citizens who have to take matters into their own hands,"" she tells me. ""But at the same time there's a strong social network that kind of replaces that, and that's how Libyans have been dealing with everything,"" she says. Long-serving ruler Col Muammar Gaddafi was overthrown in October 2011 Since then there has been no central authority Myriad armed militias took control of different parts of the country The UN has backed a government based in Tripoli There are two other rival governments Read more: Why is Libya so lawless? Kidnappings in Libya have been on the rise over the past three years. Current statistics are not available, but in 2015 the Libyan Red Crescent Society reported that more than 600 people had gone missing between February 2014 and April 2015. No-one is immune - the victims range from politicians to activists to businessmen to doctors to children. And the stories are all equally tragic. Abdel-Moez Banoun, a high-profile anti-militia activist, disappeared from Tripoli in the late summer of 2014 and has been deemed untraceable by human rights groups since. Here in Tunis, I met a young Libyan woman whose entire family had fled their home country after a relative was kidnapped and killed. Jabir Zain, a young Sudanese activist who grew up in Libya, was taken by an armed group outside a cafe in Tripoli in late September. It happened after he led a group discussion on women's rights. Human rights groups have described his case as an ""enforced disappearance"". Jabir Zain went missing after leading a discussion on women's rights in Tripoli ""We are like the living dead,"" his brother tells me on the line from Abu Dhabi, where he is currently based. His family is still in Tripoli. Some weeks on, the militia brigade that they thought was holding him denied he was with them. Mr Zain's family believes that he was forcibly disappeared for his activism. ""The longer it tookâ¦ the fewer contacts we started having,"" his brother explains. Even the most well intentioned people often fear that if they help, they will soon be targets of abduction. After numerous promises of help being on the way, phones get switched off and messages stop getting answered. Lina and her family are now familiar with this cycle too. ""We've mobilised practically the entire country. Spoken to everyone who you can possibly think of from the top people in government, to the militias, and we've got promises, empty promises,"" she tells me. Whether it is abductions, enforced disappearances, or human trafficking, these acts have become entrenched in some local communities. Signs of normal life in Libya can disguise a more dangerous reality Hanan Salah, a senior researcher with the Human Rights Watch campaign group, recently visited Libya to document cases of kidnappings. She has been researching issues in the country for several years, but the deteriorating security and the dangers that civilians are exposed to still surprise her. ""I was really shocked at the normalisation of crime, and in particular the soaring numbers of abductions for ransom, and extortions by militias and armed gangs,"" she says. She remembers one victim's story in particular. ""The reason he was kidnapped was because the family he was being held by was trying to pay off the ransom of another kidnapping case,"" she says. What has surprised Lina the most is the realisation of just how bad things are in her country. ""If you go to Libya today, during the dayâ¦ as long as there are no clashes in the streets, life is normal; people are going to school, to work, shopping. Cafes and restaurants are filled. ""It gives you this false sense that there is in fact something that's keeping this country together. ""But then when you're put into this nightmare, you realise that there are no institutions that you can turn to, and that there is a complete breakdown."" I ask her if she is angry. ""I'm very angry.  It angers me that we have three governments - not one - that claim power on the ground, and the reality is that not a single one of them have real control."" * Update 8 June 2017: Mr Beitelmal was later freed and reunited with his family.

10 seats where Brexit could be a factor,"Bristol West - which strongly backed Remain - is one constituency where Brexit could sway voters Many voters say Brexit is an important factor in the election. So which seats could be affected? When Theresa May announced that she wanted to hold an early election, her Downing Street statement focused almost exclusively on Brexit. She said the election was necessary to ""guarantee certainty and stability"" throughout the withdrawal negotiations. Opinion polls suggest that Brexit is also one of the most important issues for voters. So the result of last year's referendum is certain to have an impact on 8 June. Across the UK,52% of people voted for Leave and 48% for Remain. But support for Leave was much stronger than that in some places - whilst in others a large majority of voters backed Remain. Election 2017 poll tracker All you need to know about the UK leaving the EU Guide to the parties taking part in the general election We do not know the precise result in every constituency. Except for Northern Ireland, the referendum results were counted and declared at local council level rather than parliamentary constituency level. Some councils havereleased more localised breakdowns of voteswhich have made it possible to calculate constituency results. Here, Dr Chris Hanretty at the University of East Anglia has used the figures we do have, along with statistics about the demographic make-up of each constituency, to produce estimates of how every constituency voted. These estimates will not be 100% accurate - but they can tell us which constituencies voted decisively for Leave and Remain. Brexit could determine who wins some constituencies. And there will be many other seats where, even if it doesn't tip the overall outcome, it will have an impact on the size of the majority. Estimated votes for Leave: Clwyd South (60%), Morley & Outwood (60%), Torbay (62%), Isle of Wight (62%), Hartlepool (70%) Clwyd South in north Wales is one of a large group of Labour constituencies across Wales, the Midlands and the North of England that voted strongly to leave the EU. If the Conservatives can convince voters they are the best party to deliver Brexit, that could help them win a substantial majority. Other seats in this category include Derbyshire North East, Wakefield, Stoke-on-Trent South, Blackpool South and Scunthorpe. In many places, simply convincing UKIP voters to switch to the Conservatives would be enough. There are 67 Labour constituencies across the country where the majority is smaller than the number of votes received by UKIP in 2015. And in quite a few of those there is no UKIP candidate this time. Mrs May will be targeting Labour-held pro-Brexit constituencies like Stoke-on-Trent South There are also strongly pro-Brexit constituencies in these regions where the Conservatives are defending, such as Morley & Outwood which they took from Labour's Ed Balls in 2015. In those places, the plan will be to shore up their majority with support from Leave voters. Further south, the Conservatives also have to see off challenges from other parties. Torbay is one of the Liberal Democrats' top targets but their demand for a second referendum on the Brexit deal may not go down well in a constituency that voted 62% for Leave. The party faces the same issue in Yeovil and Cornwall North. The Isle of Wight is not a marginal constituency but the Green Party has been talking up its their chances there and hopes to benefit from tactical voting. The Green Party is bidding to gain the Isle of Wight seat They probably won't be helped by the islanders' views on Brexit - 62% voted to Leave. The Greens also want a second referendum on the terms of the Brexit deal with the option to stay in the EU. UKIP is pinning its hopes on winning over voters who backed Brexit. One of its top targets is Labour-held Hartlepool, where support for Leave was 70%. In 2015, it fell short by just over 3,000 votes. A swing of 4% would be enough for UKIP to take it this time. Estimated votes for Remain: Brighton Kemptown (56%), Ealing Central (71%), Oxford West & Abingdon (62%), Aberdeen South (68%), Bristol West (79%) The flipside to the Conservatives' strategy in Leave seats is that voters who backed Remain may not feel comfortable supporting them if they don't like the approach Mrs May has taken. Brighton Kemptown, with a Conservative majority of just 690, is one of Labour's top targets. It also had a clear majority of Remain voters. Furthermore,this is one of the seats where the Greens have said they'll stand aside, specifically with the intention of helping Labour to win. They have taken the same decision in Ealing Central & Acton but this time to help Labour defend the seat. Ealing is second on the Conservative target list with a majority of just 274. But 71% of voters backed Remain which might make their job harder. Other Remain constituencies on the Labour defence list include Hampstead & Kilburn and Hove. The Lib Dems are pitching even more clearly for Remain voters. The Greens and Lib Dems agreed to not stand against each other in two Brighton constituencies Oxford West & Abingdon has a sizeable Conservative majority but with 62% of voters backing Remain the outcome is not a done deal. Again, the Greens are standing aside and the Lib Dems will also be hoping for tactical votes from Labour supporters. Other Conservative-held Remain constituencies in their sights include Bath, Twickenham and Kingston & Surbiton. They will also argue in some Labour constituencies that their position on Brexit is clearer. Targets include Cambridge and Bermondsey & Old Southwark. In Scotland, the Conservatives have enjoyed a significant revival. They doubled their representation in the Scottish Parliament at last year's election. But Brexit could make things harder for them in some constituencies this year. Aberdeen South has been suggested as a potential gain from the SNP, which currently holds all but but three of the seats in Scotland, but it voted 68% for Remain. Finally, Bristol West is one of the most strongly anti-Brexit constituencies in the country, with 79% of voters backing Remain. The Lib Dems lost it to Labour in 2015 and will be seeking to regain it this time. But the Greens start in second place and will argue that they can represent pro-EU voters just as well.

Why Miranda fans won't be disappointed with Annie,"This video can not be played Miranda Hart plays Miss Hannigan in a new production of Annie. Fans of Miranda Hart's clownish TV persona won't be disappointed with her stage performance as the child-hating Miss Hannigan in Annie. The comedian and actress did her trademark gallop during the curtain call at the musical's opening night at London's Piccadilly Theatre. The enthusiastic celebrity-packed audience included her Miranda co-stars Tom Ellis, Patricia Hodge, Sally Phillips and Sarah Hadland. Speaking to the BBC after the show, Miranda said she felt ""exhilarated"" to be making her West End debut as the ""big and brash and clowny"" orphanage owner. ""Despite being grotesque and a drunk and vile, she's also vulnerable and very funny, so it was hard not to bring some of my humour to it,"" she said. ""There's always going to be a bit of me in the performance - and obviously I had to gallop at the end. That was essential!"" The reviews have been largely positive, with The Telegraph saying the role of Miss Hannigan takes Miranda ""outside her plummy-pleasant comfort-zone"". ""Half gorgon, half goofball, all round pleasure, she daftly-deftly combines menace with physical comedy,"" Dominic Cavendish wrotein his four-star review.,external The Guardian's Michael Billington was less convincedin his three-star-review.,external ""She works hard and sings and dances capably, but it's difficult to accept her as an accomplice, as the role demands, to abduction and possible murder,"" he said. ""Hart, I suspect, has too much heart."" Set in 1930s New York during the Great Depression, Annie tells the story of an 11-year-old girl who wants to escape from a life of misery at Miss Hannigan's orphanage and find her parents. Her luck changes when she is taken to spend Christmas at the home of billionaire Oliver Warbucks, but Miss Hannigan hatches a plan to spoil Annie's happiness and her search for her real parents. The musical includes the songs It's A Hard Knock Life, Tomorrow and Easy Street. In Monday's show Annie was played by 12-year-old Ruby Stokes, who shares the role with Madeleine Haynes, 13, and Lola Moxom, 12. They all get to play opposite the scene-stealing Amber, a Labradoodle who plays Annie's dog Sandy. Some reviews have pointed out the West End musical's unashamed optimism is just what London needs after the recent terror attacks. Alex Bourne, who plays Warbucks, said: ""Whatever happens in the world, or in our country, people still come to the theatre. ""I remember 10 years ago when there were the 7/7 bombings and I was in a show in London we all thought people wouldn't come, but they came more because people need cheering up in those times."" Miranda added: ""It's part of why we do it. We remember being Ruby's age and sitting in that magical place in the theatre and being awestruck by musicals in the way that you are at that age."" Read the full reviews inThe Guardian,external,The Telegraph,external,The Mail,external,The Stage,external,Whatsonstage,externaland theEvening Standard.,external Ruby Stokes (Annie) with Amber the Labradoodle Annie is at the Piccadilly Theatre, London, until 6 January 2018.

Does the weather affect election turnout?,"The argument seems to make sense. If on election day the weather is bad, people might well decide to stay at home rather than vote. And with the weather turning wet and windy in the UK this week, it's an argument that you might have heard or read about. But experts say there is no evidence from the UK to suggest that bad weather stops people from voting. ""There's basically no correlation between the weather and turnout,"" says Stephen Fisher an associate professor of political sociology at Oxford University. Mr Fisher's research suggests people are more likely to vote if the election race is close and there is a strong difference between the two leading parties. He points to the 2001 election, where turnout fell to 59%, the lowest since World War Two. A comfortable Labour win had been expected. And, for some, Tony Blair was not sufficiently distinct from his Conservative rivals. ""In 2001 a lot of people saw New Labour as centrist,"" says Mr Fisher. ""They didn't see much difference ideologically, and it didn't really matter who they voted for."" But political parties' efforts to get people to vote can be effective. ""Having being contacted by a party worker makes a difference to turnout,"" says Mr Fisher. Turnout has broadly been on a downward trend since its peak of 84% in 1950. But since 2001, it has perked up a bit, to about 66% in 2010 and 2015. David Cowling, senior visiting fellow at King's College London, says: ""People have turned away from established political parties. That was underlined by last year's referendum on European membership, he says, which attracted almost three million more voters than the general election of 2015. ""What it offered was motivation,"" says Mr Cowling. ""It gave a voice to people that thought they didn't have one."" So are people likely to vote in decent numbers on Thursday? In 30 years of analysing elections, John Curtice, professor of politics at the University of Strathclyde, has learnt it is ""absolutely impossible"" to forecast turnout. But he says the big difference between Labour and the Conservatives policies this time might spur people to vote, as well as the narrowing in the opinion polls as the campaign has developed. Mr Fisher says: ""I suspect turnout is likely to be higher because of the ideological divide."" Mr Cowling is keen to see whether talk of a ""galvanised young electorate is really going to become reality"". That could boost overall turnout, as young people on average have lower turnout rates than older voters. But Mr Cowling also warns that ""for a lot of people this is an important election but an unnecessary one and that may not encourage a bigger turnout than last time"".

16 things we learned from the Rangers fraud trial,"Craig Whyte arrives at the High Court in Glasgow The six weeks of evidence which ended withCraig Whyte being cleared of fraud,externaldid more than shed light on his takeover of one of Scotland's biggest football clubs. The trial also gave a fascinating glimpse behind the scenes at Rangers as the deal was being done. Here are 16 things we learned from the trial: Former Rangers manager Ally McCoist had a clause in his contract saying he should become manager The trial heard that when Rangers legend Ally McCoist became the club's assistant manager under Walter Smith, there was a penalty clause put into his contract that said if he did not become manager when Smith left, the club was going to have to pay him an ""enormous"" amount of money. Smith, McCoist's long-term mentor, only seemed to learn the full extent of the deal when he was given details in the witness box. He told defence lawyer Donald Findlay QC: ""Mr McCoist obviously negotiates his own contracts, so he's possibly a bit brighter than I am."" The financial crisis of 2008 left Sir David Murray ""technically insolvent"" The trial heard that by the end of 2009, the business empire of then Rangers owner, Sir David Murray, was left ""technically insolvent"" after the global economic crash. Sir David said he was simultaneously hit by the collapse of the global steel and property markets and the collapse of the banking sector. Mike McGill said that at the time, the Murray group's liabilities were greater than its assets and that, if asked, would not have been able to pay its debts. A decision was made to sell Rangers as part of the Murray Group restructuring. Former Rangers manager Walter Smith confirmed that the club's finances were in a ""perilous"" state before the takeover Former Rangers manager Walter Smith told the court that the club's finances were in a ""pretty perilous state"" when it was sold to Craig Whyte in 2011. Smith, who left his job three days after the takeover, said the club had a bank overdraft of about Â£18m when he first heard that Whyte would be its new owner. He acknowledged that Rangers' finances were ""distressing"" at the time and said a lack of investment or development in new talent had impacted on the club's performance. When asked if the club had been given an indication from the bank that it ""had had enough of bank-rolling Rangers"", Mr Smith said: ""Yes, we had an indication of that prior to 2011."" Rangers were Scottish champions but had mounting debts The board of Rangers discussed putting the club into administration months before it was bought by Craig Whyte. According to former financial director Donald McIntyre, the size of the club's financial liabilities meant it would have been ""remiss"" not to do so. He said Rangers faced a potential bill from HMRC of about Â£50m, which had been described as the ""Big Tax Case"". Defence QC Donald Findlay called the debt a ""nuclear missile"" that was heading straight for Rangers. He said it was ""like an exocet, nothing could be done to stop it"". Six years later the Big Tax Case is awaiting a Supreme Court ruling. Rangers won the first decision on the case but an appeal by HMRC was successful. Former owner David Murray insisted Rangers' financial woes before Whyte's takeover had been ""grossly exaggerated"". He said administration was never discussed while he was chairman of the club and he believed even by 2011 its debt was ""manageable"". There were two offers to buy Rangers which Sir David Murray did not pursue The trial heard about a fraudulent attempt to buy Rangers before Craig Whyte came on the scene.Two individuals, said to have links to the brother of an English football boss, produced a letter from a Belgian bank stating they had 50m euros (Â£42m) to invest. But one of the pair was found to have the same name as someone banned from being a company director in the UK. The letter was also discovered to be ""fraudulent"". An offer for the Ibrox club, funded by a Lithuanian bank, was rejected because of accusations it was involved in ""organised crime and money laundering"" Mike McGill, former Murray Group finance director, told the court that another offer came in and was to be funded by a Lithuanian bank. The court heard it seemed to have the ""wherewithal"" to complete a sale. But, Mr McGill told the court that the Murray Group became ""extremely uncomfortable"" dealing with the Lithuanian bank because of accusations it was involved in ""organised crime and money laundering"". There were also added concerns about any ""furore"" given the publicity surrounding the Lithuanian owners of another Scottish club. At that time, Heart of Midlothian were owned by Lithuanian tycoon Vladimir Romanov. When he took to the witness box, Craig Whyte's then lawyer, Gary Withey, admitted that he initially thought his client was part of the Whyte and Mackay whisky group. Mr Withey said that Whyte had been portrayed as ""someone with substantial financial wealth"", when he first showed an interest in buying Rangers. He added: ""Most people in the City would have said that."" Craig Whyte during a Scottish Premier League match at Ibrox in Septmber 2011 When asked how much was spent investigating Craig Whyte and his business ahead of the Rangers takeover deal,a key adviser to Sir David Murray admitted it had not been a lot. In referring to the amount spent on due diligence into Craig Whyte, David Horne told the trial: ""Not very much at all. I don't know. Possibly nothing."" Rangers chairman Dave King warned about the sources of funds available to Craig Whyte Two weeks before Craig Whyte took over Rangers, Dave King, then a director at the club, warned of a possible future police investigation into the Whyte takeover. His warning came in a letter in April 2011 to the statutory takeover panel, set up in relation to the deal. Mr King wrote of concerns about the source of Mr Whyte's funds to buy the club. Mr King said he was excluded from involvement in the takeover deal. Sir David Murray said this was not true. Rangers are back in the top flight of Scottish football after working their way up through the leagues Craig Whyte lawyer, Gary Withey, said that before the Rangers takeover, he had told Whyte he would be ""mad"" to do the dealand urged him to walk away. He said he had been ""shocked"" about the lack of financial information that had been provided by the club's sellers. Mr Withey said Whyte responded to his concerns by laughing. Gary Withey said football clubs were ""a complete nightmare"" Gary Withey, who was hired by Craig Whyte to see through the Rangers deal, was unable to tell the court how old he was. Prosecutor Alex Prentice QC asked Mr Withey to state his age - a standard question asked of all witnesses at the start of their evidence. After attempting to recall the year in which he was born, Mr Withey eventually settled on 52. Craig Whyte claimed his firm had Â£60m in assets Craig Whyte said his firm had Â£60m in assets, according to London financier John Newlands, who gave evidence in the trial. Mr Newlands said he had seen documents relating to Whyte's Liberty Capital company and in March 2011 Mr Newlands wrote a letter to the Murray Group stating Whyte could ""comfortably underwrite"" a possible Â£10m ""rights issue"". Mr Newlands also told the court that Whyte - who had been a potential business partner - once stepped in to pay a Â£2,100 rent bill when his own business was struggling. Ian Shanks said Lloyds was keen that the Whyte deal went through Senior Lloyds Banking Group manager Ian Shanks told the trial that it had played a strong role in the Whyte takeover. Lloyds inherited Rangers' multi-million pound debt after it took over the club's long time bank, Bank of Scotland. Mr Shanks said Lloyds was keen that the Whyte deal was seen through. He said Lloyds wanted its money back and wanted to get out of the football sector in general. Mr Shanks said Lloyds had no involvement in running Rangers. However, the Murray group appointed two members to the Rangers board, who were described as having a good working relationship with the bank. Rangers fans display a flag during the Ladbrokes Scottish Premiership match between Rangers and Celtic at Ibrox Stadium on April 29, 2017 Gary Withey, Whyte's lawyer, told the court that Sir David Murray's advisers were ""desperate"" to get the takeover ""over the line""and ""did not seem to care"" how Whyte was financing any deal. Mr Withey told the court: ""This was the only deal I have been involved in where the vendor was pushing more than the purchaser."" A Â£1 coin was flipped across the table to seal the deal The court heard that Craig Whyte's takeover of Rangers in May 2011 was sealed with a Â£1 coin being flipped across a table in Sir David Murray's offices. This symbolised the amount Whyte paid for Sir David Murray's majority shareholding in the club. The fraud case revolved around Whyte's commitment to use his own money to take on millions of pounds of the club's financial obligations, but the agreement put the cost of the Rangers shares at just Â£1. Finance broker Phil Betts, who worked with Mr Whyte on the deal, said the coin-flip took place during a meeting between both sides at the Murray Group offices in Edinburgh, the day after it was signed. Mr Betts said the coin was flipped in the direction of the Murray lawyers in a ""lighthearted"" manner. Mr Betts added that someone then said ""Congratulations, you are now the owner of Glasgow Rangers football club."" Donald Findlay QC is a lifelong Rangers fan The jury was never directly told that the man representing Craig Whyte - Donald Findlay QC - is a lifelong Rangers fan, a former vice-chairman of the club and has a long history with Sir David Murray, although these facts are well known outside the courtroom. One of the most memorable moments of the trial came when Mr Findlay was cross-examining Sir David. Mr Findlay put it to him that, after stepping down as Rangers chairman in 2009, the owner had been let down by people who didn't have a clue what they were doing. He said: ""From you stepping down as chairman and Craig Whyte taking over, what had these men done to your football club, Sir David?"" After a pregnant pause, Mr Findlay added: ""What had they done to OUR club?"" Sir David later replied: ""I think the club was stalling.""

Do mums really need breastfeeding help from technology?,"Ashley Albert used a breastfeeding app to help her keep track when nursing her girls Caring for a new baby can be an overwhelming experience - there's lots to cope with and keep track of. And breastfeeding isn't as easy as it looks. Can technology help new mums or is it just another layer of complexity in an already hectic life? Ashley Albert, 34, from Sacramento, California, is a real estate executive and the proud mother of Kayley and Teagan, both under four years old. She says she found using Baby Connect, an app that helps parents record breastfeeds, nappy changes, sleep times and so on, very useful. ""The newborn days are such a blur - you're in survival mode - so having something to look back to was essential,"" she says. ""It helped me with knowing how long in-between feedings my baby had gone, what side she last fed on - because I could never remember - and for how long she was averaging."" The advantages of breastfeeding are well-known, with medical bodies across the world recommending the practice for the health benefits it provides both babies and mothers. Some mums find breastfeeding difficult - but can tech help? But many mums find it difficult and painful, then struggle with feelings of guilt if they can't feed their baby naturally. So it's no wonder that Baby Connect is just one of scores of breastfeeding tracking and advice apps available for download in a fast-growing market forecast to grow from $36m (Â£28m) in 2015 to nearly $250m (Â£194m) by 2020, according to MarketsandMarkets. In 2016, breastfeeding was the second fastest-growing category on Amazon.com in the baby product sector, behind only portable cribs. And the baby care market generally is forecast to grow from $11bn this year to more than $13bn in 2021, according to research consultancy Trefis.com. One advantage of such apps is that all the recorded data can be automatically synchronised across devices - including those of other carers you authorise - and you can set up alarms to help plan your day. Mind you, babies are pretty good at setting their own ear-splitting alarms to let you know when they need something. Baby care apps can help parents keep track of feeding times ""I used the app to log breastfeeding, pumping, diapers [nappies], growth, milestones, medical information/stats, medicines, and food,"" says Ms Albert. Xavier Launay, a 48-year-old French software engineer now based in the US, says he created Baby Connect in 2008 because he wanted to help his wife manage the breastfeeding of their two kids. Back then, all records were kept on paper at the daycare nursery and Mr Launay was convinced that digital records would be more efficient. Today, the app has attracted 700,000 users - mostly in the US - who have recorded millions of baby interactions. ""When it's time for the paediatrician visit, parents know they can answer any question about the child's daily routine,"" argues Mr Launay. Alex Ooi, creator of the Feed Baby app, says he didn't see it as a business opportunity at first, more as a way of helping his partner. Now the app has been downloaded nearly two million times by users in the US, UK, Australia, Canada and Russia. How has the fitness video adapted to the YouTube age? How Facebook's tentacles reach further than you think Has the time now come for internet voting? Click here for more Technology of Business features,external He thinks that there is an opportunity for such tech to help new parents receive the advice they need. ""From what we've seen there is probably more that could be done to help connect medically certified professionals with new parents via tech,"" says Mr Ooi. But not everyone is convinced of the benefits of such apps. ""One of the major drawbacks of many such consumer apps is that the data collected does not provide meaningful insights,"" says Brahadeesh Chandrasekara, a health industry analyst at research consultancy Frost & Sullivan. ""The data do not guide the mother or families if the numbers are outside the desired range. ""There is a need for apps that can provide meaningful insights to the mother, families and the providers on the data gathered, as such valuable insights can help in identifying the root cause of a problem."" Medela's ""smart"" breast pump aims to mimic a baby's sucking action For decades now, new mums have used breastfeeding pumps to help their babies receive the health benefits of breast milk but delivered from a bottle. But traditional designs often made women feel like ungainly milch cows. About 13 million women use them worldwide, but some analysts are predicting an 11% increase in the market by 2022 as the technology improves. ""Though many women find them convenient,"" says Mr Chandrasekara, ""these devices are known to be noisy and bulky, which can make them uncomfortable. So innovation is focused on reducing their noise and size."" Leading breast pump makers include Philips, Lansinoh, Ardo, and Avent. But one, Medela, a Swiss company founded in 1961, has developed Sonata, a ""smart"" breast pump costing $399.99 (Â£300). ""Based on clinical and academic lactation research, Medela developed a two-phase technology, an advanced algorithm that creates a vacuum pattern which emulates a baby's natural suckling behaviour,"" says Stephen Flint, the firm's chief technology officer. An accompanying app, MyMedela, tracks breastfeeding and pumping sessions, as well as other metrics, such as the baby's height, weight, sleep patterns, and nappy changes. ""Sonata and MyMedela are meant to function as a complete support system that puts a mum in control of her own schedule, so that she can breastfeed, and continue to lead an independent, dynamic life,"" says Mr Flint. ""A mum doesn't just take care of her baby, she has a life to live, and other goals to pursue. If she gets help and support, she can most easily combine breastfeeding with her other goals.""

Pro-Brexit Facebook groups: Conservative converts?,"Brexit has featured heavily throughout the Conservative campaign, but how are staunch online Brexiteers feeling about the general election? To answer this question, BBC Trending delved inside some of the most popular pro-Brexit Facebook groups and found that their members have a new idol: the Conservative Party - which many see as the only effective vehicle to bring about the kind of Brexit they want. Meanwhile, there's bitter hostility towards Remainers, who they think are obstructing the referendum result. And, perhaps surprisingly, enthusiastic support for UKIP in this segment of voters seems to be ebbing away. As part of our effort to track the role of social media in the election, BBC Trending has been investigating the views of ""filter bubbles"" - tight-knit online communities that share common political beliefs. We gained access to some of the most prominent pro-Brexit Facebook groups, including""Brexit HQ"",external(13,000 members),""Britons against the EU"",external(12,000 members),""Brexit needs to happen ASAP"",external(6,000 members) and a range of similar groups. The pro-Brexit bubble is sizeable, though it is markedly smaller than thepro-Remainandpro-Jeremy Corbynbubbles - yet that shouldn't be taken as a measure of the popularity of or enthusiasm for those political viewpoints. It could well be, for instance, that the relative youth of Remain and Corbyn supporters means those groups are more active on social media. More from BBC Trending:How can you burst your filter bubble? Inside the pro-Brexit groups, members avidly discuss British identity and are scathing about those who want Britain to remain in the EU. They are heavily in favour of the Conservative Party in the upcoming general election, and they distrust Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. ""Britons against the EU"" has 12,000 members on Facebook Patriotism is the subject of extensive discussion in these pro-Brexit groups, and the British flag is flown in many posts. Many members call for the return of a more traditional form of national identity, which they believe has been corrupted by the EU: Similarly, the Brexiteers of Facebook are ruthless towards Remainers - particularly those who say that Britain will suffer outside the EU. Yet, whereas UKIP might have been the natural home of these Brexit voters prior to the referendum, many are now cheerleading for the Conservatives. On 31 May, the founder of ""Brexit HQ"" created a general election poll in the group. More than 500 people responded - with 85% saying they would vote for the Conservatives and 13% saying they would vote for UKIP. Three people said they would be voting Liberal Democrat, and only one person backed Labour. Filter Bubble Britain: General Election coverage from BBC Trending Online Remainers: Can't agree who to vote for The secret yearnings of pro-Tory Facebook groups Inside the Corbynista Facebook 'army' Indeed, despite saying that the issue of Brexit is now ""settled"" following the EU referendum, Jeremy Corbyn is widely distrusted by Facebook Brexiteers. One member of ""Britons against the EU"" commented: ""FAKE Corbyn supports a FAKE BREXIT."" But Brexit isn't the only issue on which Corbyn is criticised. His economic policies are also in the firing line, with images such as this widely used: However, despite their condemnation of the Labour leader, group members aren't entirely convinced that Theresa May will steer the Tories to victory. In fact, following arecent slumpin the opinion polls, a handful have come up with their own, original, explanations. One member of ""Britons against the EU"" wildly speculated that the Conservatives were deliberately throwing away the election, ""possibly under the orders of higher authoritiesâ¦ their bosses in the EU.""

US football stars back disqualified girl,"This video can not be played 'They think I'm a boy but I'm really not' Two US women football stars have rushed to defend an eight-year-old girl whose team was disqualified after she was accused of looking like a boy. Short-haired Milagros ""Mili"" Hernandez has been praised on social media by Olympians Mia Hamm and Abby Wambach. Mili's club team was booted from Sunday's final tournament in Omaha, Nebraska, even after her father showed identity documents proving her gender. Tournament officials cite an error on team forms for the disqualification. Their attention was drawn to the issue because someone on a rival team complained, based on her appearance. Officials then checked the forms and contacted the Azzurri Soccer club, where Mili plays for the Achurros team, to say she was listed as a boy. Abby Wambach, who also has short hair, defending 8-year-old Mili Before her team could take the field, they were summarily disqualified. Her father, Gerardo Hernandez, had brought her insurance card and other documentation to Sunday's game, but said that tournament officials were not interested in speaking to him. ""They told us the thing was decided,"" he told the Washington Post, adding that ""that wasn't the right way to treat people"". ""Just because I look like a boy doesn't mean I am a boy. They don't have a reason to kick the whole club out,"" Mili told local station WOWT-TV. Two-time gold medallist and World Cup winner Hamm made an offer to Mili to play at the Team First Soccer Academy camp, which she hosts. Wambach published an Instagram video with the message: ""Mili, don't EVER let anyone tell you that you aren't perfect just as you are. I won championships with short hair."" On Monday, parents met to discuss the incident, with one angry parent demanding ""there needs to be justice"". The Cachorros team have filed a complaint with the Nebraska State Soccer Association alleging both gender and racial discrimination.

May says Trump 'wrong' to criticise Khan,"This is not the first time Donald Trump and Sadiq Khan have argued in public Theresa May has said Donald Trump's criticism of Sadiq Khan in the wake of the London Bridge terror attack was ""wrong"". But the PM said the US president's state visit would still go ahead. Mr Khan, the mayor of London, has called for it to be cancelled - as has Lib Dem leader Tim Farron. Mr Trump attacked Mr Khan on Twitter after the mayor told Londoners not to be alarmed about an increased police presence following Saturday's attack. The London mayor said Mr Trump was wrong about ""many things"" and that his state visit, expected to take place later this year, should not go ahead. London attack updates UK stands in silence after London attack What Trump's latest Twitter tirade tells us Trump antagonises British spymasters Mrs May, who had previously stopped short of criticising the US president's comments, said: ""I think Donald Trump was wrong in the things he has said about Sadiq Khan... we have been working with Sadiq Khan - party politics are put to one side - we work together."" She replied ""yes"" when asked if Mr Trump's official trip to Britain would go ahead. The PM also emphasised the importance to UK security of the special relationship. This video can not be played Sadiq Khan, Mayor of London: ""There aren't words to describe the grief and anger our city will be feeling today"" This video can not be played Trump's son criticises London mayor to ABC News Seven people were killed and 48 injured when three men drove a van into pedestrians and stabbed people in bars in the London Bridge and Borough Market areas of the capital on Saturday night. Speaking in the aftermath of the attack, Mr Khan said there were no words to describe the ""grief and anger"" the city was feeling, before saying: ""Londoners will see an increased police presence today and over the course of the next few days. No reason to be alarmed."" The US president criticised Mr Khan for this on Twitter, saying: ""At least 7 dead and 48 wounded in terror attack and Mayor of London says there is 'no reason to be alarmed!'"" A spokesman for Mr Khan responded, saying he had ""more important things to do"" than respond to Donald Trump's ""ill-informed tweet"" that ""deliberately"" took his remarks ""out of context"". But Mr Trump tweeted again on Monday, saying: ""Pathetic excuse by London Mayor Sadiq Khan who had to think fast on his ""no reason to be alarmed"" statement. MSM [mainstream media] is working hard to sell it!"" Mr Khan said he didn't think the UK should ""roll out the red carpet to the president of the USA in the circumstances where his policies go against everything we stand for"". A skateboard, a crate: How London fought back Third London Bridge attacker named London attack: what we know so far Mr Farron has labelled Mr Trump ""an embarrassment to America"", and his Lib Dem foreign affairs spokesman Tom Brake added: ""Theresa May has allowed Donald Trump 24 hours to bully the mayor of London. It isn't good enough."" Earlier Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who is also a former London mayor - defended Mr Khan, saying he had been ""entirely right to say what he said to reassure people of his city about the presence of armed officers on the streets"". But he told the Today programme the state visit invitation had been issued and accepted and he saw ""no reason to change that"". White House adviser Sebastian Gorka defended the president's comments, saying he was making a ""very valid point"". He told BBC Newsnight: ""We have to jettison political correctness. We have to apply honesty to the threat and saying, 'It's just business as usual, don't worry about a thing', [is] a Pollyannaish attitude to a threat that has killed 170 people in the last two years in Europe alone and maimed more than 700."" He insisted there was no chance the state visit would be cancelled, saying: ""If anybody thinks that a state visit is held hostage to Twitter then they have no understanding of the relationship between London and Washington."" Mr Khan and the US president have clashed several times in the past, with the London mayor criticising Mr Trump's remarks about Muslims and his attempts to bring in a travel ban against people from six mainly-Muslim countries trying to enter the US, and Mr Trump labelling him a ""buffoon"" and challenging him to an IQ test.

How do the parties expect to do on election day?,"Can we learn something about the results we will wake up to on Friday morning by looking at where the party leaders have been campaigning? We have - as an experiment - been trying to see what we can discern about the parties from their movements. Based on their recent visits, I think the party leaders' choices of venue suggest the Conservatives are expecting to pick up a hefty majority. Labour's expectations are much harder to read. To understand the pattern a bit better, let us start with this chart - which is a bit like a swingometer. Each block represents a Tory-facing Labour seat (in red) or a Labour-facing Tory seat (in blue). And each stack of blocks tells you how many seats each party gains if they improve their polling, in two percentage points increments. Seats near the centre line are more marginal. Seats further away are safer. We can then overlay this with black markers, which show all the places that Jeremy Corbyn and Theresa May have visited.  Here, then, is the distribution of trips by the two main parties' leaders since the Conservative manifesto launch in mid-May - for Labour and the Tories. The Tories have dispatched Theresa May fairly consistently to the same sorts of seats since the campaign began: largely Labour-held seats which would require fairly big swings to take. Let us assume that the Conservatives have not sent her to places that are absolutely safe nor dead losses. This pattern can give us an idea about which seats the Tories think are in play. So I've also drawn in a line, which marks a plausible frontier between the two parties. That implied frontier is a guess about how big a swing the Tories think is plausible, based on how far out they've dared to push those campaign visits. Do not read too much into the specifics here: I think reasonable people could draw them into different places. But this approach may help us with a ballpark estimate of broad Tory expectations. (Drawing in a line is of no use for Labour: I have written before about how Labour does not appear to be pursuing a strategy of deploying Mr Corbyn directly into the front line - we will come to them later.) What, then, to make of that Tory frontier line? If you simply assume the Tories were to win up to the line implied by their frontier, they would take around 81 seats. That would imply a tremendous landslide. But that is to miss an important factor about where these visits have arrived.  The Tories have been focused,as I wrote at the start of the campaign, on pro-Leave seats with lots of UKIP voters. So here is the same chart, redrawn with only those seats recording a 60%-plus Leave vote, according to estimates of constituency referendum votes by Dr Chris Hanretty at the University of East Anglia. The Tories have been focusing heavily on this pro-Brexit part of England and Wales - and that frontier I drew on the first graph really reflects the Tories' big ambitions in these sorts of seats. A line in the neighbourhood I've drawn in here would give them around 25 of these sorts of seats.   Conversely, though, the Tories have scarcely bothered with the strongly pro-Remain seats. I have not drawn a frontier on the basis of one dot - but it does not imply great ambitions for these low-UKIP seats. That, of course, leaves the rest of the country - where neither Leave nor Remain got 60%. And you can see that while Mrs May has been campaigning here, she has been a little more modest in her ambitions than in the more strongly pro-Leave areas. My suggested frontier here that would give her around another 20 seats. Another way to consider the question of where you draw these lines is to look at these constituencies on this graph, which shows individual seats as dots. The further left or right they are, the safer they are. The higher they are, the more UKIP voters they have. The blue rings are prime ministerial visits. I have had a go at drawing in a frontier here, too. You get similar sorts of numbers from looking at it this way, too. What about Scotland, though? Theresa May has made few visits north of the Tweed, butRuth Davidson's Conservative and Unionist Party,as they have been branded in lots of places, have another leader. So here is the chart showing her visits, and Nicola Sturgeon's. (You can read more about the geography of the Scottish campaignover here.) The first minister's visits are a bit complicated to read: she is running a defence against three parties. So some of those seats are getting visits because they are under threat from the Liberal Democrats, say. But if I draw in a line for Ms Davidson's visits as I did for Ms May's, it implies hoped-for gains of somewhere around 10 to 15 seats. All in all, these simple exercises give you implied Tory gains of, somewhere between 50 and 60 seats. I might have drawn the lines too far out in some cases, and too close in in others. But the big picture is that the Conservatives believe they are heading to a big win. It is hard to pick frontier lines that do not lead there. Remember, though: this is not a forecast, but an attempt to guess at what the Tories' campaign implies they are aiming for. As I mentioned, the Labour leader's visits are harder to read. If I were to simply draw in a frontier for Labour, based on their most ambitious visits, it would imply they expected to take 40 seats from the Tories - which is definitely not the expectation of people involved in running the campaign inside the Labour party. It is, in particular, hard to make sense of Mr Corbyn's alternating visits to Tory-held marginals and then very safe Labour seats. I have written about this pattern before - but it is possible that Mr Corbyn keeps going to safe seats where he can hold big events, which look much better on television than Ms May's. And remember: local TV news matters. Jeremy Corbyn's campaign stop in Telford Indeed, if, instead of looking at constituencies, we look at the different ITV news regions visited by the two leaders, you can see Mr Corbyn has been going to the same sort of geographical regions as the Tories (with a bit more effort in the Anglia region, where the Tories are defending a lot of marginals). Boiled into TV terms, they are going to similar places. So it is possible that Labour has the same diagnosis about the likely dynamics of this race. They are just choosing to use their leader in a different way to fight it. I will return to this later to see if this experiment has yielded useful information. Maybe the lesson will be that the parties know nothing. Maybe the shape of any swing will fit this rough pattern, but the size will be different. Or vice-versa. Maybe we will learn that parties deploy their leaders over-optimistically or over-pessimistically? Maybe there's evidence in there, but I am missing it. I have no prior example to work from, and have used lots of fairly arbitrary judgment calls here - particularly around where the ""frontier"" line goes on our graphs. Labour's pattern of visits is difficult to make sense of. It is hard to escape the assumption, though, that the Tories are behaving as though they expect to make quite big gains. If we tinker about with those sorts of questions, and polling remains difficult to follow, leader visits may prove to be a useful tool. Maybe not. We will know more on Friday morning.

Harvard bans students for 'obscene' chat,"Harvard administrators asked students to explain their contributions to the chat group ""Obscene"" memes posted on a private Facebook page have cost 10 students their place at Harvard,reports the college's newspaper.,external The students posted messages joking about child abuse, sexual assault, paedophilia and the Holocaust. Members of the group also directed several racial slurs at minorities, said the report. Free speech advocates criticised Harvard's actions saying the punishment was ""draconian"". Information about Harvard's actions was reported by the Crimson - the main student newspaper at the prestigious college. The obscene material was posted to a chat forum on Facebook that grew out of a messaging group set up by students due to start studying at Harvard this year. The offshoot group was formed by prospective students who were interested in memes and who wanted to share more ""adult"" material than was seen in the main chat room. Anyone wanting to join the sub-group had to apply by creating and posting a ""provocative"" meme. Soon after the group was formed, Harvard administrators found out about it and launched an investigation asking students to explain their contributions to the chat group. A week later, said the report, ""at least 10"" members of the group were told that their admission offers to Harvard had been withdrawn. In a statement to the Crimson, a spokeswoman for Harvard said it did ""not comment publicly on the admissions status of individual applicants"". Prof Alan Dershowitz, who lectures at the Harvard Law School, said the college had gone too far in withdrawing the offer of admission.He told the Guardian,externalthat the institution had been ""intruding too deeply"" into the private lives of students by censoring communications protected by free speech laws. The decision could have long-term consequences for the students involved, he warned. ""It may affect them for life,"" he said.

Kuenssberg: Will security be a help or a hindrance?,"The prime minister just about leapt onto the platform in a Staffordshire rugby club this morning. She told the audience that she liked election campaigns - but after what has certainly been a trickier campaign for her than expected, Theresa May seems to be pleased at the prospect that the campaign (although perhaps not the retributions afterwards) is nearly over. Live: Follow the latest developments in the campaign Election battle over police funding Manifesto guide: What the parties are promising What she most certainly did not expect was in the closing days to be having to answer for her record as home secretary, which the attacks in Manchester and London have thrown into sharp relief. Remember she called this election believing she was in a position of strength - hoping her record, and the perceived weakness of Jeremy Corbyn, would see her safely home. Instead, among the dozens of press questions she has taken in the last couple of days she has repeatedly been asked whether the decisions she made as home secretary have left us more at risk of attack - and was even asked today if she should apologise to the grieving families for any security failures on her watch. Certainly, the Labour Party has, to use the terrible jargon, had ""cut through"" with its attempt to tie security and austerity together as one campaign issue - citing police cuts as making us less safe. Labour candidates say there is public awareness and anxiety about this, particularly in the wake of the London Bridge and Manchester attacks. Conversely, while the Tories had been frustrated that Jeremy Corbyn's attitudes on security have played less prominently in the campaign than they had expected, the new focus on security means Theresa May faces increased scrutiny - but it may also, as last week's Question Time suggested, put more seeds of doubt in voters' minds about Mr Corbyn. Senior Tory figures today believe it could help the vote ""crystallise"" back to them in this vital final 48 hours. We'll see - but what has been, at some of the last events of the campaign, a political hindrance might, in the privacy of the polling booth, be a big help.

Trump claims credit for Qatar isolation,"This video can not be played Qatar's foreign minister says there is no evidence of support for radical Islam US President Donald Trump has claimed credit for the pressure being placed on Qatar by Gulf neighbours who accuse it of supporting terrorism in the region. He said his recent visit to Saudi Arabia was ""already paying off"" and the development might mark the ""beginning of the end to the horror of terrorism"". Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the UAE, Yemen, Libya's eastern-based government and the Maldives have all cut diplomatic and other ties with Qatar. Qatar strongly denies the allegations. Mr Trump's recent speech in the capital Riyadh, in which heblamed Iranfor instability in the Middle East and urged Muslim countries to take the lead in combating radicalisation, is seen as likely to have emboldened Gulf allies to act against Qatar. ""During my recent trip to the Middle East I stated that there can no longer be funding of Radical Ideology. Leaders pointed to Qatar - look!"" Mr Trumptweeted,externalon Tuesday. He latertweeted,external: ""So good to see the Saudi Arabia visit with the King and 50 countries already paying off. They said they would take a hard line on funding... extremism, and all reference was pointing to Qatar. Perhaps this will be the beginning of the end to the horror of terrorism!"" The Qatar diplomatic crisis explained Why this row has erupted I'm flying through the Gulf: How will this affect me? Qatar is home to the biggest US military air base in the Middle East, with about 8,000 personnel based at al-Udeid. The official statement from White House spokesman Sean Spicer said the US was in communication with all parties ""to resolve issues and restore co-operation"". ""The US still wants to see this issue de-escalated and resolved immediately, in keeping with the principles that the president laid out in terms of defeating terror financing and extremism,"" he said. In the same week as Mr Trump's Riyadh speech, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and the UAEblocked Qatari news sites, including Al Jazeera. On Monday, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, and the UAE gave Qatari nationals two weeks to leave, banned their own citizens from travelling to Qatar, and cut all transport links. Saudi Arabian Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir said on Tuesday that the economic measures should persuade Qatar to change its policies and behave ""like a normal country"". Speaking in Paris, he called on Qatar's rulers to end their support for the Muslim Brotherhood, the Palestinian militant group Hamas and what he called ""hostile media"". ""We believe that common sense and logic and will convince Qatar to take the right steps,"" he said. The emir of Kuwait - one of the Gulf countries not involved in the dispute - travelled to Saudi Arabia on Tuesday in an attempt to mediate. He later left after a ""brotherly visit"" but there was no word on the outcome of the talks. This video can not be played Qatar Airways passengers in Abu Dhabi vent frustration Qatari Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed Bin Abdulrahman al-Thani told Al Jazeera that his country would not retaliate but was unhappy with regional rivals ""trying to impose their will on Qatar or intervene in its internal affairs"". He told the BBC that Qatar was well prepared to withstand a ""blockade"", but also complained that the people of Qatar were the  victims of ""collective punishment"" by other countries. The foreign minister said his government had told President Trump during his Middle-East trip that there was no evidence that Qatar was supporting radical Islamists, adding that the claims were based on ""fabricated evidence and lies"". To be clear, when it comes to terrorist financing, nobody's hands are clean. The Qataris, Saudis and Kuwaitis have all funded extremists in the Syria conflict. All have pulled back from that under US pressure. But Qatar's dealings are arguably murkier than the others because it likes to see itself as a neutral player that can act as an intermediary, and is thus willing to play both sides - Saudi Arabia and Iran. Whatever the case, the Pentagon doesn't share Mr Trump's tone of triumphalism. Qatar hosts America's biggest Middle East air base, the nerve centre for the air campaigns in Syria and Iraq against the Islamic State group. So far officials say operations have not been affected, but they might be if diplomatic feuding continues amongst US Arab allies. The states that joined Monday's move against Qatar, a tiny but gas-rich peninsula, include some of the biggest powers in the Arab world. Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and the UAE closed all transport links. Food, flights and football at risk Five things you may not know about Qatar Disruption to airspace in the Gulf began on Tuesday morning local time. Doha, Qatar's capital, is a major hub for international flight connections. Airlines affected include Qatar Airways, Etihad Airways and Emirates. Saudi Arabia and Bahrain have revoked the licences of Qatar Airways and ordered its offices to close within 48 hours. When avoiding Saudi Arabia, their massive - and only - neighbour, Qatar's planes are having to take more indirect routes, leading to longer flight times. Saudi pulls Qatar Airways licence In a country reliant on imported food, residents have started to stockpile. Residents were stockpiling water on Monday A substantial amount of Qatar's food is transported across the border from Saudi Arabia, which is being closed.

Qatar is a member of the exporters' group Opec and the dispute could yet undermine the organisation's efforts to raise prices by restricting production.

Broadly, two key factors drove Monday's decision: Qatar's ties to Islamist groups, and to Iran, Saudi Arabia's regional rival.

Johnson rejects calls to halt Trump visit,"This is not the first time Donald Trump and Sadiq Khan have argued in public Theresa May has said Donald Trump's criticism of Sadiq Khan in the wake of the London Bridge terror attack was ""wrong"". But the PM said the US president's state visit would still go ahead. Mr Khan, the mayor of London, has called for it to be cancelled - as has Lib Dem leader Tim Farron. Mr Trump attacked Mr Khan on Twitter after the mayor told Londoners not to be alarmed about an increased police presence following Saturday's attack. The London mayor said Mr Trump was wrong about ""many things"" and that his state visit, expected to take place later this year, should not go ahead. London attack updates UK stands in silence after London attack What Trump's latest Twitter tirade tells us Trump antagonises British spymasters Mrs May, who had previously stopped short of criticising the US president's comments, said: ""I think Donald Trump was wrong in the things he has said about Sadiq Khan... we have been working with Sadiq Khan - party politics are put to one side - we work together."" She replied ""yes"" when asked if Mr Trump's official trip to Britain would go ahead. The PM also emphasised the importance to UK security of the special relationship. This video can not be played Sadiq Khan, Mayor of London: ""There aren't words to describe the grief and anger our city will be feeling today"" This video can not be played Trump's son criticises London mayor to ABC News Seven people were killed and 48 injured when three men drove a van into pedestrians and stabbed people in bars in the London Bridge and Borough Market areas of the capital on Saturday night. Speaking in the aftermath of the attack, Mr Khan said there were no words to describe the ""grief and anger"" the city was feeling, before saying: ""Londoners will see an increased police presence today and over the course of the next few days. No reason to be alarmed."" The US president criticised Mr Khan for this on Twitter, saying: ""At least 7 dead and 48 wounded in terror attack and Mayor of London says there is 'no reason to be alarmed!'"" A spokesman for Mr Khan responded, saying he had ""more important things to do"" than respond to Donald Trump's ""ill-informed tweet"" that ""deliberately"" took his remarks ""out of context"". But Mr Trump tweeted again on Monday, saying: ""Pathetic excuse by London Mayor Sadiq Khan who had to think fast on his ""no reason to be alarmed"" statement. MSM [mainstream media] is working hard to sell it!"" Mr Khan said he didn't think the UK should ""roll out the red carpet to the president of the USA in the circumstances where his policies go against everything we stand for"". A skateboard, a crate: How London fought back Third London Bridge attacker named London attack: what we know so far Mr Farron has labelled Mr Trump ""an embarrassment to America"", and his Lib Dem foreign affairs spokesman Tom Brake added: ""Theresa May has allowed Donald Trump 24 hours to bully the mayor of London. It isn't good enough."" Earlier Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who is also a former London mayor - defended Mr Khan, saying he had been ""entirely right to say what he said to reassure people of his city about the presence of armed officers on the streets"". But he told the Today programme the state visit invitation had been issued and accepted and he saw ""no reason to change that"". White House adviser Sebastian Gorka defended the president's comments, saying he was making a ""very valid point"". He told BBC Newsnight: ""We have to jettison political correctness. We have to apply honesty to the threat and saying, 'It's just business as usual, don't worry about a thing', [is] a Pollyannaish attitude to a threat that has killed 170 people in the last two years in Europe alone and maimed more than 700."" He insisted there was no chance the state visit would be cancelled, saying: ""If anybody thinks that a state visit is held hostage to Twitter then they have no understanding of the relationship between London and Washington."" Mr Khan and the US president have clashed several times in the past, with the London mayor criticising Mr Trump's remarks about Muslims and his attempts to bring in a travel ban against people from six mainly-Muslim countries trying to enter the US, and Mr Trump labelling him a ""buffoon"" and challenging him to an IQ test.

Russian Baltic jet intercepts US bomber,"B-52 bombers have been in service since 1955 Russia scrambled an Su-27 fighter on Tuesday to intercept a US B-52 bomber over the Baltic Sea, the Russian defence ministry said. The B-52 was in international airspace but close to the Russian border, and was escorted away, the ministry said. The Su-27 then returned to its Baltic Fleet airbase. A similar incident happened on 9 May over the Black Sea, involving a US P-8A Poseidon surveillance plane and a Russian Su-30 fighter. Separately on Tuesday, Russian media reported that a Russian fighter jet had been scrambled to intercept a Norwegian patrol plane over the Barents Sea. The Su-27 has served in the Russian air force since 1985 Russia and Nato have boosted their military forces in the Baltic region amid an escalation of tensions over Ukraine. Russia has based nuclear-capable Iskander missiles at its Kaliningrad exclave in the Baltic, and Nato says Russian air patrols have increased in the region. Russia has condemned Nato's military deployments near its Baltic borders, accusing the alliance of aggression. Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the conflict in eastern Ukraine led to the worst political chill in Europe since the Cold War.

Germany sees rise in fake father scams,"A non-German mother can stay if her baby has German citizenship German officials say growing numbers of pregnant immigrant women are paying German men to pose as fathers so that they can qualify for residency. German broadcaster RBB found up to 700 cases in Berlin alone. ""There are many unreported cases,"" said Ole SchrÃ¶der, a top interior ministry official. There has been a rise in asylum requests from pregnant women from Vietnam, Africa and Eastern Europe. A new law is being drafted to tackle the fake paternity racket,RBB reports,external. Some pregnant immigrant women are reported to have paid fake fathers and solicitors as much as â¬5,000 (Â£4,356; $5,628) to get paternity registered. Once that is done, the baby automatically becomes a German citizen and the mother has the right to stay. However, in 2013 a German Constitutional Court ruling said that even in suspicious cases it might not be worth contesting paternity, because the child could end up stateless and left in legal limbo. It is generally easier for refugees fleeing conflict to get residency in Germany than for economic migrants who have escaped poverty in Africa, Asia or Eastern Europe. Germany has moved to tighten asylum rules since the 2015 influx of more than 800,000 migrants, most of them refugees from Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan. Immigration is a major issue ahead of parliamentary elections in September. The influx hit some local authorities especially hard, as they struggled to house and integrate the newcomers. However, there was a sharp drop in the numbers claiming asylum in 2016, after barriers were erected on the Balkan migration route. Massive drop in German asylum seekers Record migrant numbers leave Germany Ten attacks a day on Germany migrants Polls suggest that the nationalist Alternative for Germany (AfD), opposed to mass immigration, has gained support and is on course to enter the federal parliament (Bundestag) for the first time. Mr SchrÃ¶der, a member of Chancellor Angela Merkel's centre-right Christian Democrats (CDU), said ""we have a lot of evidence from the immigration authorities - fake fathers are making money out of this... in other words, this involves a considerable amount of criminality"". In one case reported by RBB, a far-right sympathiser, convicted for sporting neo-Nazi symbols, claimed to be the father of a Vietnamese child. Martin Steltner, a state prosecutor in Berlin,told ARD television,externalthere were signs of widespread abuse involving paternity, for example one man claiming to be the father of 10 children. The fake fathers rarely pay any child support, as many are living off social welfare, ARD reports. A note on terminology: The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum. This group includes people fleeing war-torn countries such as Syria, who are likely to be granted refugee status, as well as people who are seeking jobs and better lives, whom governments are likely to rule are economic migrants.

16 things we learned from the Craig Whyte trial,"Craig Whyte arrives at the High Court in Glasgow The six weeks of evidence which ended withCraig Whyte being cleared of fraud,externaldid more than shed light on his takeover of one of Scotland's biggest football clubs. The trial also gave a fascinating glimpse behind the scenes at Rangers as the deal was being done. Here are 16 things we learned from the trial: Former Rangers manager Ally McCoist had a clause in his contract saying he should become manager The trial heard that when Rangers legend Ally McCoist became the club's assistant manager under Walter Smith, there was a penalty clause put into his contract that said if he did not become manager when Smith left, the club was going to have to pay him an ""enormous"" amount of money. Smith, McCoist's long-term mentor, only seemed to learn the full extent of the deal when he was given details in the witness box. He told defence lawyer Donald Findlay QC: ""Mr McCoist obviously negotiates his own contracts, so he's possibly a bit brighter than I am."" The financial crisis of 2008 left Sir David Murray ""technically insolvent"" The trial heard that by the end of 2009, the business empire of then Rangers owner, Sir David Murray, was left ""technically insolvent"" after the global economic crash. Sir David said he was simultaneously hit by the collapse of the global steel and property markets and the collapse of the banking sector. Mike McGill said that at the time, the Murray group's liabilities were greater than its assets and that, if asked, would not have been able to pay its debts. A decision was made to sell Rangers as part of the Murray Group restructuring. Former Rangers manager Walter Smith confirmed that the club's finances were in a ""perilous"" state before the takeover Former Rangers manager Walter Smith told the court that the club's finances were in a ""pretty perilous state"" when it was sold to Craig Whyte in 2011. Smith, who left his job three days after the takeover, said the club had a bank overdraft of about Â£18m when he first heard that Whyte would be its new owner. He acknowledged that Rangers' finances were ""distressing"" at the time and said a lack of investment or development in new talent had impacted on the club's performance. When asked if the club had been given an indication from the bank that it ""had had enough of bank-rolling Rangers"", Mr Smith said: ""Yes, we had an indication of that prior to 2011."" Rangers were Scottish champions but had mounting debts The board of Rangers discussed putting the club into administration months before it was bought by Craig Whyte. According to former financial director Donald McIntyre, the size of the club's financial liabilities meant it would have been ""remiss"" not to do so. He said Rangers faced a potential bill from HMRC of about Â£50m, which had been described as the ""Big Tax Case"". Defence QC Donald Findlay called the debt a ""nuclear missile"" that was heading straight for Rangers. He said it was ""like an exocet, nothing could be done to stop it"". Six years later the Big Tax Case is awaiting a Supreme Court ruling. Rangers won the first decision on the case but an appeal by HMRC was successful. Former owner David Murray insisted Rangers' financial woes before Whyte's takeover had been ""grossly exaggerated"". He said administration was never discussed while he was chairman of the club and he believed even by 2011 its debt was ""manageable"". There were two offers to buy Rangers which Sir David Murray did not pursue The trial heard about a fraudulent attempt to buy Rangers before Craig Whyte came on the scene.Two individuals, said to have links to the brother of an English football boss, produced a letter from a Belgian bank stating they had 50m euros (Â£42m) to invest. But one of the pair was found to have the same name as someone banned from being a company director in the UK. The letter was also discovered to be ""fraudulent"". An offer for the Ibrox club, funded by a Lithuanian bank, was rejected because of accusations it was involved in ""organised crime and money laundering"" Mike McGill, former Murray Group finance director, told the court that another offer came in and was to be funded by a Lithuanian bank. The court heard it seemed to have the ""wherewithal"" to complete a sale. But, Mr McGill told the court that the Murray Group became ""extremely uncomfortable"" dealing with the Lithuanian bank because of accusations it was involved in ""organised crime and money laundering"". There were also added concerns about any ""furore"" given the publicity surrounding the Lithuanian owners of another Scottish club. At that time, Heart of Midlothian were owned by Lithuanian tycoon Vladimir Romanov. When he took to the witness box, Craig Whyte's then lawyer, Gary Withey, admitted that he initially thought his client was part of the Whyte and Mackay whisky group. Mr Withey said that Whyte had been portrayed as ""someone with substantial financial wealth"", when he first showed an interest in buying Rangers. He added: ""Most people in the City would have said that."" Craig Whyte during a Scottish Premier League match at Ibrox in Septmber 2011 When asked how much was spent investigating Craig Whyte and his business ahead of the Rangers takeover deal,a key adviser to Sir David Murray admitted it had not been a lot. In referring to the amount spent on due diligence into Craig Whyte, David Horne told the trial: ""Not very much at all. I don't know. Possibly nothing."" Rangers chairman Dave King warned about the sources of funds available to Craig Whyte Two weeks before Craig Whyte took over Rangers, Dave King, then a director at the club, warned of a possible future police investigation into the Whyte takeover. His warning came in a letter in April 2011 to the statutory takeover panel, set up in relation to the deal. Mr King wrote of concerns about the source of Mr Whyte's funds to buy the club. Mr King said he was excluded from involvement in the takeover deal. Sir David Murray said this was not true. Rangers are back in the top flight of Scottish football after working their way up through the leagues Craig Whyte lawyer, Gary Withey, said that before the Rangers takeover, he had told Whyte he would be ""mad"" to do the dealand urged him to walk away. He said he had been ""shocked"" about the lack of financial information that had been provided by the club's sellers. Mr Withey said Whyte responded to his concerns by laughing. Gary Withey said football clubs were ""a complete nightmare"" Gary Withey, who was hired by Craig Whyte to see through the Rangers deal, was unable to tell the court how old he was. Prosecutor Alex Prentice QC asked Mr Withey to state his age - a standard question asked of all witnesses at the start of their evidence. After attempting to recall the year in which he was born, Mr Withey eventually settled on 52. Craig Whyte claimed his firm had Â£60m in assets Craig Whyte said his firm had Â£60m in assets, according to London financier John Newlands, who gave evidence in the trial. Mr Newlands said he had seen documents relating to Whyte's Liberty Capital company and in March 2011 Mr Newlands wrote a letter to the Murray Group stating Whyte could ""comfortably underwrite"" a possible Â£10m ""rights issue"". Mr Newlands also told the court that Whyte - who had been a potential business partner - once stepped in to pay a Â£2,100 rent bill when his own business was struggling. Ian Shanks said Lloyds was keen that the Whyte deal went through Senior Lloyds Banking Group manager Ian Shanks told the trial that it had played a strong role in the Whyte takeover. Lloyds inherited Rangers' multi-million pound debt after it took over the club's long time bank, Bank of Scotland. Mr Shanks said Lloyds was keen that the Whyte deal was seen through. He said Lloyds wanted its money back and wanted to get out of the football sector in general. Mr Shanks said Lloyds had no involvement in running Rangers. However, the Murray group appointed two members to the Rangers board, who were described as having a good working relationship with the bank. Rangers fans display a flag during the Ladbrokes Scottish Premiership match between Rangers and Celtic at Ibrox Stadium on April 29, 2017 Gary Withey, Whyte's lawyer, told the court that Sir David Murray's advisers were ""desperate"" to get the takeover ""over the line""and ""did not seem to care"" how Whyte was financing any deal. Mr Withey told the court: ""This was the only deal I have been involved in where the vendor was pushing more than the purchaser."" A Â£1 coin was flipped across the table to seal the deal The court heard that Craig Whyte's takeover of Rangers in May 2011 was sealed with a Â£1 coin being flipped across a table in Sir David Murray's offices. This symbolised the amount Whyte paid for Sir David Murray's majority shareholding in the club. The fraud case revolved around Whyte's commitment to use his own money to take on millions of pounds of the club's financial obligations, but the agreement put the cost of the Rangers shares at just Â£1. Finance broker Phil Betts, who worked with Mr Whyte on the deal, said the coin-flip took place during a meeting between both sides at the Murray Group offices in Edinburgh, the day after it was signed. Mr Betts said the coin was flipped in the direction of the Murray lawyers in a ""lighthearted"" manner. Mr Betts added that someone then said ""Congratulations, you are now the owner of Glasgow Rangers football club."" Donald Findlay QC is a lifelong Rangers fan The jury was never directly told that the man representing Craig Whyte - Donald Findlay QC - is a lifelong Rangers fan, a former vice-chairman of the club and has a long history with Sir David Murray, although these facts are well known outside the courtroom. One of the most memorable moments of the trial came when Mr Findlay was cross-examining Sir David. Mr Findlay put it to him that, after stepping down as Rangers chairman in 2009, the owner had been let down by people who didn't have a clue what they were doing. He said: ""From you stepping down as chairman and Craig Whyte taking over, what had these men done to your football club, Sir David?"" After a pregnant pause, Mr Findlay added: ""What had they done to OUR club?"" Sir David later replied: ""I think the club was stalling.""

Graves dug up in missing mother hunt,"This video can not be played Britain's Got Talent missing mother believed murdered Police investigating the disappearance of a 17-year-old mother 14 years ago are digging up several graves. Acting on new information about Natalie Putt, who disappeared in 2003, West Midlands Police believes it is ""looking at a murder inquiry"". The force said it received a call from a man with ""specific information that has the potential to lead to the person responsible for Natalie's death"". Officers are digging in Ruiton Cemetery in Upper Gornal near Dudley. Family members said in a statement they were ""very upset about the developments and ask that our family is left in peace until such time that we hear definitive news from the police"". Read more news for Birmingham and the Black Country ""In the near 14 years that Natalie has been missing, we have never given up hope of finding her safe and well. Until we know anything to the contrary this remains the case,"" they said. Natalie Putt left her home in Lower Gornal, West Midlands, to go to a shop in September 2003 ""We, her sisters Becky and Lowri, are together, surrounded by pictures of Natalie and have lit candles as a sign of hope."" An image of Ms Putt was broadcast on the ITV show Britain's Got Talent on Friday during a performance by a choir made up of relatives of missing people. Police said while the information prompting the digs predated the broadcast, the programme's timing was ""fortuitous"", with information about Ms Putt coming in as a result. After the show, Rebecca Coggins wrote on Facebook of Ms Putt, her half sister, ""still sad to see you on there but I'm so grateful they featured you tonight"". The operation at Ruiton Cemetery is expected to take several days Ms Putt left her home in Lower Gornal, Dudley, to go to a shop in September 2003, leaving behind her baby son, then aged 11 weeks. An 18-year-old man was arrested in March 2004 in connection with her disappearance, but later released without charge. Since Ms Putt went missing, officers have searched open land close to her home, including underwater searches of rivers and lakes, and farmland in Wombourne, where it is understood she kept horses. Det Insp Ian Iliffe said: ""We have had no positive sightings of Natalie in all these years and there has never been any financial activity connected to her bank accounts or any access to health services across the country, which points to the fact that she is no longer alive."" He said the force also believed at least two people ""know what has led us to this site [the cemetery] and they may have further information which could assist our search"". There are people who know what has led officers to the cemetery, police say He said the specific information the force received came from a man in a telephone box in the Lake Street area of Gornal. ""This crucial information could help us solve this mystery and give Natalie's family the answers they need,"" he added. ""I would urge that person to contact us again and we will ensure the information they have is treated with the strictest confidentiality.""

Qatar travel: What does it mean for me?,"Many airlines have suspended flights to and from Qatar's capital, Doha. The issues arose after the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Bahrain, Libya and Yemenall cut diplomatic ties with Qatar. They say it backs Islamist terror groups, which Qatar denies. Those countries have now closed their airspace to the country's flag carrier, Qatar Airways. So what should passengers do? Anyone who'd planned flying direct between Qatar and the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Bahrain will be impacted. So too are passengers to/from those four countries who were due to be transiting through Qatar, for instance Singapore to Cairo via Doha or London to Riyadh via Doha. Qatar Airways has suspended all flights to those four countries until further notice. Passengers with confirmed bookings with a travel date between 5 June and 6 July 2017, can get a full refund on any unused ticket. This video can not be played Qatar Airways passengers in Abu Dhabi vent frustration You also have the option to rebook up to 30 days after your confirmed departure date. This will be free of charge, but you can only change once. Passengers with existing bookings should call +974 4023 0072 or contact theirnearest Qatar Airways office.,external It won't be possible.  But under the rules of airline industry body IATA, you must be offered the option of being rebooked onto other carriers. So if, for example, you are due to fly from London to Dubai, via Doha, Qatar Airways has to find you an alternative - either a direct or indirect flight. It says it will do that, but it all depends on availability, so potentially you may not travel exactly when planned. Again, to make these arrangements call +974 4023 0072 or contact yournearest Qatar Airways office.,external The airline says things proceed as normal. You can still fly in and out of Qatar's hub in Doha. So a journey from, say, Singapore to London via Doha is unaffected. Qatar Airways has been very restricted in where its planes can fly But because Qatar Airways is not using the airspace of Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain or Egypt it has just a narrow strip to operate in, meaning it is having to take different routes. On some routes this will add to flight times (as well as Qatar's fuel bill) - though the airline has not yet said how much difference it is likely to make to trip durations. It's not just Qatar Airways. If you are due to fly in or out of Qatar from the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Egypt or Bahrain then your flight will not be taking off. Airlines operating these routes include Etihad, Emirates, Flydubai, Air Arabia, Gulf Air, Saudi Arabian Airlines (Saudia) and Egyptair. Etihad is one of the airlines that will not be taking off from Doha All airlines seem to be offering the same options - either a full refund on unused tickets or rebooking onto the nearest alternative destination on its network. Emirates: You can apply online forrefunds,externalor contact your localEmirates office,external. Etihad:  Passengers should call +971 2599 0000 or visitits website,external. FlyDubai: Call +971 600544445, +974 4 4227350/51, contact your travel agent orsend a private message to its Facebook page.,external Air Arabia: The airline - which operates from two of the UAE's northern emirates - says passengers should call +971 6 5580000 or go toits website.,external Gulf Air: Passengers booked on Bahrain's national carrier can call +973 17373737 or visitits website,external. Saudia and Egyptair have not issued specific contact numbers. Given there's no direct travel, you could fly to another location that is not part of the ban, and then go from there. For example Oman Air and Kuwait Airways are still operating Doha flights so passengers could travel via Muscat or Kuwait City. Bear in mind though that if you are a citizen of the UAE, Saudi, Bahrain, Egypt, Yemen or Libya you won't be allowed into Qatar, and vice versa, Qataris are being told to leave countries that have cut ties. There's no fixed end date for this. Nobody appears to be taking any booking on this route for the next month. Of course there's a chance this will be resolved sooner than this. Or, indeed, that it will go on far longer. Qatar backs talks to end Gulf crisis What's behind crisis with Qatar?

Kuenssberg: A help and a hindrance?,"The prime minister just about leapt onto the platform in a Staffordshire rugby club this morning. She told the audience that she liked election campaigns - but after what has certainly been a trickier campaign for her than expected, Theresa May seems to be pleased at the prospect that the campaign (although perhaps not the retributions afterwards) is nearly over. Live: Follow the latest developments in the campaign Election battle over police funding Manifesto guide: What the parties are promising What she most certainly did not expect was in the closing days to be having to answer for her record as home secretary, which the attacks in Manchester and London have thrown into sharp relief. Remember she called this election believing she was in a position of strength - hoping her record, and the perceived weakness of Jeremy Corbyn, would see her safely home. Instead, among the dozens of press questions she has taken in the last couple of days she has repeatedly been asked whether the decisions she made as home secretary have left us more at risk of attack - and was even asked today if she should apologise to the grieving families for any security failures on her watch. Certainly, the Labour Party has, to use the terrible jargon, had ""cut through"" with its attempt to tie security and austerity together as one campaign issue - citing police cuts as making us less safe. Labour candidates say there is public awareness and anxiety about this, particularly in the wake of the London Bridge and Manchester attacks. Conversely, while the Tories had been frustrated that Jeremy Corbyn's attitudes on security have played less prominently in the campaign than they had expected, the new focus on security means Theresa May faces increased scrutiny - but it may also, as last week's Question Time suggested, put more seeds of doubt in voters' minds about Mr Corbyn. Senior Tory figures today believe it could help the vote ""crystallise"" back to them in this vital final 48 hours. We'll see - but what has been, at some of the last events of the campaign, a political hindrance might, in the privacy of the polling booth, be a big help.

Planet is 'hotter than most stars',"Artwork: The planet, named KELT-9b, orbits its star about 650 light-years from us Scientists have found a hellish world where the ""surface"" of the planet is over 4,000C - almost as hot as our Sun. In part, thatâs because KELT-9bâs host star is itself very hot, but also because this alien world resides so close to the furnace. KELT-9b takes just two days to complete one orbit of the star. Being so close means the planet cannot exist for very long - the gases in its atmosphere are being blasted with radiation and lost to space. Researchers say it may look a little like a comet as it circles the star from pole to pole - another strange aspect of this discovery. News of KELT-9b isreported in the journal Nature,external. Its highly unusual properties were also presented on Monday to the spring meeting of theAmerican Astronomical Society,externalin Austin, Texas. ""We found [KELT-9b] back in 2014, if you can believe it; and it took us this long to finally convince ourselves that this truly bizarre and unusual world was in fact a planet orbiting another star,"" Prof Scott Gaudi, from The Ohio State University, told BBC News. ""We know pretty well how big the planet is and how massive it is: it's about three times the mass of Jupiter and twice as big as Jupiter. ""We know the parent star's properties reasonably well: it's about two and a half times more massive than the Sun; it's almost twice as hot as the Sun; and it's rotating very rapidly and so it would appear very flattened to our eyes."" The planet is tidally locked to its star, meaning it always presents the same face - just as our Moon never shows its far side to Earth. This raises the temperature on the ""day side"" of KELT-9b to over 4,300C - hotter than the surface of the average Red Dwarf star, by far the most common type of star in the Milky Way. The host star - known by the simple designation of KELT-9 - is radiating so much ultraviolet light that it may completely erode the planet's atmosphere. Prof Gaudi's team calculates material is being lost at a current rate of perhaps 10 billion or 10 trillion grams per second. If KELT-9b possesses a rocky core, this could be laid bare eventually, but a more likely end scenario is that the planet will be engulfed by the star. This star is what's termed an A-type object. These stars burn brilliant but brief lives. They exist for just millions of years rather than the billions of years that our Sun is expected to persist. So it may not be long before KELT-9 puffs up as it exhausts its fuel and eats the planet. The discovery was made using a robotic telescope system that uses high-end - but standard - camera telephoto lenses attached to scientific grade detectors. The Ohio State University operates the system at two locations, one in the northern hemisphere and one in the southern hemisphere. It is a collaboration with Vanderbilt University, Lehigh University, and the South African Astronomical Observatory. This astronomical facility goes by the name of theKilodegree Extremely Little Telescope,external. ""We named the telescope kind of as a joke; we're poking a little fun at ourselves,"" said Prof Gaudi.

'Gunshots' at Paris's Notre Dame,"This video can not be played Paris: Inside Notre-Dame during lockdown Police have shot a man who attacked an officer with a hammer outside the Notre-Dame cathedral in Paris. The man shouted ""this is for Syria"" during the attack, the interior minister said. Prosecutors have opened a terrorism investigation. The officer suffered minor injuries. The suspect was wounded in the chest when another policeman opened fire. Tourists fled for cover as the attack unfolded. Hundreds of people were in the cathedral at the time. France is in a state of emergency since attacks by jihadists in Paris killed 130 people in 2015. It is part of the US-led international coalition against IS and has conducted air strikes against militants in Syria. How France is wrestling with jihadist terror Watch:State of emergency explained The assailant on Tuesday afternoon carried kitchen knives and the identity card of an Algerian student, French Interior Minister GÃ©rard Collomb said. This video can not be played Nancy Soderberg describes being trapped inside the cathedral The man, who was being treated in hospital, has not been named. Former White House Deputy National Security Adviser Nancy Soderberg shared this picture from inside the cathedral The terrorist spotlight has swung to Britain, but no-one in France is under the illusion that the country is safe. Squads of soldiers with automatic weapons at the ready are a regular sight on the streets of Paris. France remains a favourite target for the propagandists of so-called Islamic State. What intrigues is the similar character of four recent attacks in Paris: at the Louvre in February, where a man attacked a soldier with a machete; at Orly airport in  March, where an attacker was killed after trying to take a gun from a soldier; on the Champs-ElysÃ©es last month, where a  gunman killed a policeman before himself being killed; and now this. Different from the recent UK atrocities - and the earlier French attacks in Paris and Nice - none of these recent French attacks was against random targets. They were all conducted by lone men. And they were all against clearly identified symbols of the state. As police declared the situation ""under control"", hundreds of people were being allowed to leave the cathedral. Kellyn Gorman, an American tourist, said: ""I was about to come inside [the cathedral] and heard the noise, the gunshots, turned around and saw the assailant on the ground where they had shot him."" Police have closed some streets and have asked people to stay away from the area ""It was very safe, very quickly contained."" Notre-Dame is one of the most visited tourist sites in Paris. Last year,police foiled an attack near the site. The incident comes just three days after militants used a van and knives in an attack in London which left seven dead. 20 Apr 2017- A convicted criminal who was investigated for threatening to kill police opens fire at police on the Champs Elysees in Paris, killing one and wounding two. He is shot dead - and the assault is claimed by IS 3 Feb 2017- A machete-wielding Egyptian man shouting ""Allahu akbar"" attacks French soldiers at Paris's Louvre Museum - he is shot and wounded 26 Jul 2016- Two attackers slits the throat of a priest at his church in Saint-Etienne-du-Rouvray, in Normandy. They are shot dead by police 14 Jul 2016- A huge lorry mows down a crowd of people on the Nice beachfront during Bastille Day celebrations, killing 86. IS claims the attack - by a Tunisian-born driver, later shot dead by police 13 Jun 2016-A knife-wielding jihadist kills a police officer and his partner at their home in Magnanville, west of Paris. He declares allegiance to IS, and police later kill him 13 Nov 2015- IS jihadists armed with bombs and assault rifles attack Paris, targeting the national stadium, cafes and Bataclan concert hall. The co-ordinated assault leaves 130 people dead, and more than 350 wounded 7-9 Jan 2015- Two Islamist gunmen storm the Paris offices of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, killing 17 people.

Cosby's diehard fans stick by fallen idol,"A fading mural of Bill Cosby still stands near the Richard Allen homes in North Philadelphia Less than two weeks before Father's Day, the man once affectionately known as America's Dad stepped back into the public spotlight to defend his legacy as he faced one of dozens of sexual assault allegations against him. Dressed in a dark navy suit, the 79-year-old was supported by the use of a cane and Keisha Knight Pulliam, the woman who played his precocious daughter, Rudy Huxtable, on the landmark television series The Cosby Show. But his reputation as a fatherly figure has been overshadowed in recent years by the more than 50 women who have come forward to accuse him of sexual assault. The actor and comedian is facing three counts of felony aggravated indecent assault stemming from a 2004 incident in which former Temple University employee Andrea Constand claims he drugged and molested her. Cosby trial begins in Pennsylvania Cosby sex assault case: Five questions answered He maintains his innocence, though some among the chorus of women who have offered up similar accounts appeared in court in Norristown, Pennsylvania, wearing pins with the words emblazoned: ""We stand in truth."" Though the allegations have tarnished Mr Cosby's reputation, the actor has long been considered a Hollywood trailblazer for African Americans. He rose to fame as the first black actor to star in a major drama series, I Spy, in 1965. The role earned him three of his four Emmy awards before he created several shows including the influential The Cosby Show in 1984. Darnell Hunt, the director of the Ralph J Bunche Center for African American Studies at UCLA, says his depiction of an upwardly mobile African-American family transcended race and broke new ground in an era otherwise criticised for portraying the ""ghetto-centric"" black stereotypes. The US-UK divide on sex case Timeline of Cosby accusations ""It showed that black people were American, too, which was sort of Cosby's political philosophy,"" he said. This video can not be played Cosby was accompanied by Cosby Show co-star Keshia Knight Pulliam on the trial's first day ""It was and is still one of the most talked about TV shows ever and it certainly had a huge impact on this sort of whole discussion of images of black people and media."" In fact, Mr Cosby enlisted Harvard psychiatrist Dr Alvin Poussaint as a consultant to ensure the scripts underscored a genuine family dynamic. Which is why it may be difficult for some Americans to separate the career he has made on promoting family values and education from the man Assistant District Attorney Kristin Feden accused of being a sexual predator in court on Monday. This video can not be played Cosby accuser Lili Bernard speaks out as the trial begins Mr Cosby and one of his daughters have recently suggested race played a role in the allegations against him. The suggestion sparked outrage among some critics who point to previous comments he made in which he criticised single African-American mothers and young black men. ""Many blacks felt it was him talking down to them and blaming them as opposed to the systemic forces that keep black people subordinated,"" says Mr Hunt. ""But the sad reality is race is always a factor in America and that lens will be significant regardless of whether or not the allegations are racially motivated,"" says Mr Hunt, who wrote OJ Simpson Facts and Fictions, a book on the racial divide and perception of the American footballer's famous trial. ""There is probably a lot of ambivalence in the black community with respect to the meaning of all of this,"" he added. ""People are probably waiting to see how all of this works out with the trial."" Some Philadelphia residents like Rickey A Rivera, who lives in Mr Cosby's childhood neighbourhood, remain convinced the case has racial undertones. ""He can never be who he was and that's what's sad to me,"" Mr Rivera says. Other Philadelphia residents have struggled to reconcile how to talk about the local hero and the allegations against him. This video can not be played ""Bill Cosby was like a hawk looking at a little mouse"" A mural that once stood on Broad Street depicting Mr Cosby and other famed fathers has disappeared, but another still stands amid the housing projects where he grew up in North Philadelphia's Poplar neighbourhood. William ""Buddy"" Savin, who owns a funeral home in the area, points out his own partially eroded image on a similar pillar beneath an overpass less than 100ft (30 metres) away from the portrait of Mr Cosby. Mr Cosby is seen flashing his signature grin, holding his fist in what appears to be a nod to black power as children play in the foreground. Mr Savin grew up with Mr Cosby in the Richard Allen housing project and spoke to him as recently as last week about the death of a mutual friend and Philadelphia jazz legend, Mickey Roker. The projects have mostly been torn down and replaced with new rows of town homes, but remnants of a past life - and Mr Cosby's legacy - still exist. ""He was a black person who made it but he never forgot his roots,"" Mr Savin says. ""He always came back to the projects."" Though some residents are cagey when asked about Mr Cosby, everyone seems to have an anecdote about the comedian. A women standing in her front yard not far from where his house stood explains how she once saw Mr Cosby perform at her high school, but demurs when asked about her feelings on him now. ""I have his autograph,"" she tells the BBC. ""That's all I can say about him."" News helicopters hover of the courthouse But Mr Savin is happy to recount Mr Cosby's community work despite the scandal that has engulfed him over the last few years. A bespectacled man dressed in a pinstriped suit, he recalls how Mr Cosby returned to the neighbourhood when the new Richard Allen townhomes opened in 2003. He speaks about Mr Cosby's generous funding for dozens of children's education and his contributions to the nearby Temple University. The Temple ""T"" logo stands tall atop a building visible from the Richard Allen homes. Mr Cosby, one of the Temple's most famous alumni, is often credited with helping to transform Temple from a local school to a nationally recognised university. The school, just blocks away, is where he met Ms Constand while serving on the school's board of trustees. In the wake of the allegations, Temple eventually joined a growing number of colleges and universities that revoked the dozens of honorary degrees he received over the years. He was also removed from the board of trustees. Mr Cosby's presence on campus has mostly been erased, but university students like Olivia Jefferson, 25, remain conflicted. ""He was the ideal black father. He showed this image personally we didn't see in the black community often growing up,"" she says.  ""And all these allegations coming out, it's a betrayal.""

Trump antagonises British spymasters,"President Trump has unleashed another Twitter storm, infuriating officials in London. This has posed special challenges for the US-UK relationship. Trump hurled an insult at London's mayor, Sadiq Khan, shortly after the terrorist attacks in his city. Then Trump went after Khan again on Monday, tweeting that he was offering only a ""pathetic excuse"" for the mayor's earlier statement that Britons should remain calm in the wake of the terror attack. Many British officials are enraged - especially those who work in counterterrorism. Still there's little chance that they'll break up with the Americans. For both sides, there's too much at stake. The relationship has had its ups and downs under the Trump administration. At certain times, the president and his aides have shown their commitment to the relationship - and said that they want things to work. They've shown their concern in different ways. Latest updates: London attack Standing outside Nato's new building in Brussels last month, Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, scrolled impatiently though his phone, looking for my email address. He wanted to send a message, and he was in a hurry. Tapping on the keypad, he told me: ""It's from the president."" It was a presidential statement that condemned leaks in the US media and the way that news outlets had revealed details about a terrorism investigation in Manchester. The UK investigators were angry about the leaks and said that they didn't want to share any more information with the Americans: the Britons didn't want their secrets revealed. The issue of the leaks had reached the highest level of government: UK Prime Minister Theresa May had even complained publicly about them. In the president's statement, the one Spicer emailed to me in Brussels, Trump said he found the leaks in the US media ""deeply troubling"". He also talked about the value that he placed on the partnership between the US and the UK. ""There is no relationship we cherish more than the Special Relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom,"" he said.  The president and his aides seemed to care deeply what Britons thought and wanted the BBC to get their message across - at least on that day. Things changed. On Saturday night three men drove across London Bridge in a van, slamming into pedestrians, then got out and stabbed others. The attack left seven dead and scores wounded, and afterwards European leadersexpressed condolences,externalandsolidarity,externalthrough postings on social media. In contrast Trumptweeted,external, and then headed for a golf course. Sadiq Khan was said to be too busy to respond to Mr Trump's tweets Khan didn't bother to reply. It was an unusual deep rift between officials in the US and the UK. In the realm of counterterrorism, as well as in other realms, officials from the two countries have close ties. Trump renews feud with London Mayor Americans who work in the intelligence community in Washington sometimes joke that Britons have easier access to one of their agencies, the Central Intelligence Agency, than they do. The Americans are exaggerating, but it's true that the Americans at the CIA and their counterparts in the UK have traditionally worked together closely on terrorism cases, attempting to track information about commanders and unravel plots before they are carried out. The US services have vast resources for intelligence gathering and, as Chatham House's Simon Palombi pointed out, they've established a network of informants who report on activities within the al-Qaeda network and the so-called Islamic State group. Meanwhile the British officials ""have front-line experience"", said Paul Pillar, a former CIA analyst and the author of a book entitled Why America Misunderstands the World, referring to the attacks that have been carried out in their country. Working together, the British and US officials are better able to understand the militants and their organisations. They also express solidarity when things are difficult. Those who've worked in the intelligence services said that searching for clues in the hours after a terrorist attack is a challenge - and that leaders can help calm people down or rile them up. The president's jab at the London mayor, they said, made things worse. Sadiq Khan told Londoners not to be alarmed by increased police presence in the days after the attack ""It was just outrageous,"" said Pillar. Pillar said: ""If I were a senior official in British intelligence, my blood pressure would still be high enough to say: 'If we've done any temporary shutting off of sharing, let's just keep it shut off for now.'"" Later on Sunday the president softened his tone towards the Britons. Speaking at a Washington theatre, he said he and other Americans would ""do everything in our power to assist the United Kingdom and its citizens as they work to protect their country"". His remarks underscored the importance of the relationship between the two countries. They also captured a trend in his presidential style: he antagonises other nations and people and then acts friendly. While in Brussels, Spicer had rushed out a conciliatory message from the president, and later the president acted in a less accommodating manner. Veterans of the intelligence world understand the importance of sharing between the US and the UK, however, and say the strengths of each nation improves the overall quality of their work. If the two nations broke up, the quality of their work would deteriorate, said Matthew Olsen, a former director of the US national counterterrorism centre. ""A lot goes back and forth,"" he said. ""Both countries would suffer."" For that reason, Pillar said, he's not worried about a breakup. He believes their relationship - like all relationships - has its ups and downs but will endure. After some time has passed since ""the last insulting tweet from Donald Trump"", as he put it, ""they'll quietly restore relations"". ""I'm not sure when that will happen,"" Pillar said.

Whyte not guilty of Rangers deal fraud,"This video can not be played Craig Whyte: 'I'm just delighted with the outcome' Former Rangers owner Craig Whyte has been cleared of taking over the Glasgow football club by fraud in May 2011. He was acquitted by a jury following a seven-week trial at the High Court in Glasgow. The 46-year-old was also found not guilty of a second charge under the Companies Act. The jury of eight men and seven women took just two hours of deliberations to return not guilty verdicts on both charges. Following the verdict, the SFA said it wouldconsider pursuing Mr Whyte over a Â£200,000 finefor bringing the game into disrepute. The penalty was imposed by the governing body in 2012, but the money was never paid. Mr Whyte took over Sir David Murray's majority shareholding for Â£1 in May 2011, while agreeing to take on obligations, which included paying an Â£18m bank debt and Â£5m for players. 16 things we learned from the trial How the takeover ended up in the dock Craig Whyte's Rangers 'villainy' remains Alastair Johnson rejoins Rangers board He was charged with using the club's own money for the deal while claiming the funds were his. After the verdict, judge Lady Stacey told Mr Whyte: ""You have been acquitted and are free to leave the dock."" He thanked the judge and jury before leaving the courtroom. Questioned by reporters as he left the building, he said: ""I'm just delighted with the outcome."" During the trial, jurors at the High Court of Glasgow were told how Mr Whyte struck a Â£1 deal to purchase Sir David Murray's controlling stake at Ibrox. As well as the Â£18m bank debt and money for players, Whyte had agreed to provide Â£2.8m to settle a ""small tax case"" bill, Â£1.7m for stadium repairs, and Â£5m in working capital. Prosecutors had alleged that Whyte pretended to Sir David, and others, that funds were available to make all required payments. The jury were told Mr Whyte had only Â£4m available from two sources at the time, but took out a Â£24m loan from Ticketus against three years of future Rangers season ticket sales, before he owned the club. The second charge under the Companies Act centred on the Â£18m payment between Mr Whyte's Wavetower company and Rangers to clear a bank debt. Mr Whyte had denied both the charges against him. His defence QC, Donald Findlay, had earlier told the jury that Mr Whyte had been made to look like a ""pantomime villain"". He had said the Murray team had been ""more focused"" on securing a sale than on checking out the source of the money. Mr Findlay said his client had met the conditions of the sale by paying the debt and investing in the club. He blamed Sir David's advisers, saying they ""let him down very badly"" in the deal and did not ask where the takeover money was coming from. Summing up the defence case, Mr Findlay said: ""They were not interested in where the money came from and we know this absolutely categorically."" The defence QC had also pointed out that there had been ""no loss"" to Sir David Murray in the buyout.

Sir David Attenborough's family regrets,"Sir David said he didn't believe in the ""pearly gates"" Sir David Attenborough says his only career regret is missing out on time with his children. The Planet Earth presenter said his work took him away for months at a time when his two children, Susan and Robert, were growing up. Sir David told theRadio Times,external: ""If you have a child of six or eight and you miss three months of his or her life, it's irreplaceable. You miss something. ""Perhaps you can't have your cake and eat it."" Attenborough said his wife, Jane, who died in 1997, had been very ""understanding"", however. A month after celebrating his 91st birthday, Sir David told interviewer Louis Theroux that he thinks about his own mortality ""all the time"", because ""it's more and more likely that I'm going to die tomorrow."" Asked if he expects anything to happen afterwards, he said simply: ""No."" On the subject of global warming, Sir David warned: ""We should be very, very worried about it.... the land is being scorched, deserts are spreading, and the seas are warming - all those factors cause great changes in our fortunes."" When asked which animal he felt a kinship with, Sir David replied: ""That has to be an ape. Because our kinship is a reality. I don't feel it with a mosquito or, indeed, a whale.""

Qatar backs talks to end Gulf crisis,"Flight tracking technology by the FlightRadar24 website shows the limited route being taken by Qatar Airways flights on Tuesday morning Qatar is backing plans for talks with its regional rivals as a diplomatic row gathers pace. Several countries have cut ties with Qatar, accusing it of supporting terrorism in the Gulf region. Neighbours including Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) have closed their airspace to Qatari planes. Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump has said he was told during his recent visit to Saudi Arabia that Qatar was funding ""radical ideology"". ""During my recent trip to the Middle East I stated that there can no longer be funding of Radical Ideology. Leaders pointed to Qatar - look!"" hetweeted,external. Kuwait - one of the Gulf countries not involved in the dispute - has offered to mediate talks, and Qatar said it was receptive to dialogue. In an interview with Qatar's al-Jazeera network, the Qatari foreign minister said Kuwait's emir would travel to Saudi Arabia on Tuesday for talks. Sheikh Mohammed Bin Abdulrahman al-Thani told Al Jazeera that Qatar was seeking ""a dialogue of openness and honesty"". Six countries - Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Yemen, Libya's eastern-based government and the Maldives - cut diplomatic ties with Qatar on Monday. Bahrain, Saudi Arabia and the UAE have given Qatari nationals two weeks to leave, and banned their own citizens from travelling to Qatar. The Qatar diplomatic crisis explained Why this row has erupted I'm flying through the Gulf: How will this affect me? This video can not be played The evidence of the rift is clear at Doha's airport, the BBC's James Robbins reports The states that joined Monday's move against Qatar, a tiny but gas-rich peninsula, include some of the biggest powers in the Arab world. Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and the UAE closed all transport links by air, land and sea. The UAE and Egypt expelled Qatari diplomats, giving them 48 hours to leave, and Saudi Arabia closed down a local office of al-Jazeera. Food, flights and football at risk Five things you may not know about Qatar Disruption to airspace in the Gulf began on Tuesday morning local time. Doha, Qatar's capital, is a major hub for international flight connections. Airlines affected by the airspace restrictions include Qatar Airways, Etihad Airways and Emirates. When avoiding Saudi Arabia, their massive - and only - neighbour, Qatar's planes are having to take more indirect routes, leading to longer flight times. On Tuesday, Saudi Arabia revoked Qatar Airways' licence and ordered the company's Saudi offices to shut within 48 hours. Saudi pulls Qatar Airways licence In a country reliant on imported food, residents have started to stockpile. ""People have stormed into the supermarket hoarding food, especially imported ones,"" one Doha resident, Eva Tobaji, told Reuters. ""It's chaos - I've never seen anything like this before."" Residents were stockpiling water on Monday A substantial amount of Qatar's food is transported across the border from Saudi Arabia, which is being closed. That is also an important route for construction materials - needed for the energy industry and for the preparations for the 2022 football world cup. Qatar's exports are dominated by oil and gas. They are mostly seaborne, so should not be immediately hit, but the general economic disruption could have an impact if the dispute drags on. That possibility pushed the price of crude oil higher, but only briefly. Qatar is a member of the exporters' group Opec and the dispute could yet undermine the organisation's efforts to raise prices by restricting production. 'A Qatarstrophe' - social media reacts All you need to know about Qatar While the severing of ties was sudden, it has not come out of the blue, as tensions have been building for years, and particularly in recent weeks. Broadly, two key factors drove Monday's decision: Qatar's ties to Islamist groups, and to Iran, Saudi Arabia's regional rival. Wealthy individuals in Qatar are believed to have made donations and the government has given money and weapons to hardline Islamist groups in Syria - Qatar says this is not the case. The Financial Timesalso reports,externalthat Gulf allies were angry that Qatar paid a $1bn (Â£773m) ransom to jihadists and Iranian security officials afterQatari nationals were kidnappedin Iraq and Syria. Saudi Arabia, too, has been accused of funding IS, either directly or by failing to prevent private donors from sending money to the group - allegations it denies. Is Saudi to blame for IS? Analysts also say the timing of the diplomatic withdrawal, two weeks after a visit to Riyadh by President Trump, is crucial. Mr Trump's speech in Saudi Arabia, in which heblamed Iranfor instability in the Middle East and urged Muslim countries to take the lead in combating radicalisation, is likely to have emboldened Gulf allies to act against Qatar. Where key countries stand on IS In the same week as Mr Trump's speech, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and the UAEblocked Qatari news sites, including al-Jazeera. Comments purportedly by Qatar's Emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, criticising Saudi Arabia had appeared on Qatari state media. The government in Doha dismissed the comments as fake, attributing the report to a ""shameful cybercrime"". This video can not be played US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson urges Gulf states to ""address differences"" In the interview with al-Jazeera, Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed Bin Abdulrahman al-Thani said Qatar would not retaliate but was unhappy with regional rivals ""trying to impose their will on Qatar or intervene in its internal affairs"" He said Qatar's emir, at the request of his Kuwaiti counterpart, had cancelled a speech scheduled later for Tuesday, to allow negotiations to proceed calmly The Philippines, which has an estimated 200,000 residents in Qatar, said it had stopped the deployment of workers to the Gulf state Philippines labour official Silvestre Bello told a new conference he feared Filipinos in Qatar would ""be the first victims"" in the event of riots over food shortages.

Arundhati Roy's much-awaited second coming,"Arundhati Roy waited for 20 years to write her second novel ""Normality in our part of the world is a bit like a boiled egg: its humdrum surface conceals at its heart a yolk of egregious violence,"" writes Booker Prize-winning author Arundhati Roy in The Ministry Of Utmost Happiness, her whimsically titled second novel. ""It is our constant anxiety about that violence, our memory of its past labours and our dread of its future manifestations, that lays down the rules of how a people as complex, as diverse as we are continue to coexist - continue to live together, tolerate each other and, from time to time, murder one another."" Arundhati Roy: The Ministry of Utmost Happiness Arundhati Roy: India's economic success a 'lie' Roy's new book, which comes out on Tuesday and will be published in 30 countries, is a coruscating and ambitious novel about India. It teems with outcasts - ""mad souls and wicked ones"" - and those on the fringes of an increasingly iniquitous society - a trans woman who survives a religious riot and sets up home in a graveyard is at the centre of the story. It is also a restless novel of loss - and some love - written in prose which is often incandescent and funny. She writes about activists flocking to ""international supermarkets"" of grief and sorrow. She describes the conflict in Kashmir, which is a ""war that can never be won or lost, a war without end"", where ""dying became just another way of living"". And a Billie Holiday-loving intelligence officer and his wife and teenage daughter look ""like a model family of small, soft toys"". This video can not be played Arundhati Roy reads from her new book The Ministry of Utmost Happiness The overlay of non-fiction hangs heavily over the fiction, something many critics have found jarring and which has prompted the question: Is The Ministry really fiction, or an extended polemical essay, a smorgasbord of Roy's favourite causes? Or is it a fabulist novel about a nation of a million mutinies, bounding ambition and bristling frustration? Truth informs fiction, Roy avers, and writers write about societies they live in. Over the past two decades, she wrote eight non-fiction books and and several essays on subjects as diverse as the nuclear bomb, Kashmir, big dams, globalisation, Dalit icon and social reformer BR Ambedkar, her meetings with Maoist rebels andconversations with Edward Snowden and actor John Cusack,external. Roy's new novel will be published in 30 countries So, Roytold BBC Radio 4recently, ""there is a big difference in what I do with fiction, and what I do with non-fiction"". ""In those journeys [over the past 20 years] so much was beginning to accumulate in me which was not possible for me to write in non-fiction. If you take Kashmir, it is not possible to explain to somebody just in terms of human rights reports, the number of people killed and tortured, or incarcerated. ""What does it mean to have your air seeded with terror, what does it mean to people living under the boot for 20 years, what does it do to your cellular structure? In fact, fiction is the truth there, you know."" The reception to her first novel for 20 years has been mixed. TheFinancial Times,externalcalled her the ""mistress of the memorable vignette and the arresting detail"", and said the novel was as ""remarkable as her first"".Time magazine,externalfound it a ""novel of conflict on a grand scale"", blending the personal and political, and ""well worth the 20-year-old wait"".The New Yorker,externallauded Roy for delivering a ""scarring novel of India's modern history"" and compared the scenes of violence in the book to passages in Rushdie's Midnight's Children or Marquez's One Hundred Years of Solitude. Others were more circumspect. The Guardian,externalsaid the ""clashing subplots and whimsical digressions can become rather unwieldy"" in a ""scattershot narrative"", which sometimes ""slips into purple prose"" and feels ""less polished"" than the first novel.The Irish Times,externalcalled it a ""messy and superficial but good-natured narrative"".The Economist,externalwas unimpressed by an ""overlong, unfocused doorstopper, one that would have benefited from a firmer editorial hand"". AndThe Spectator,externalfound the novel excellent in parts, but sometimes descending into ""angry, weepy sentimentality"". In a rare takedown at home,Huffington Post India,externalcalled the novel ""frustratingly rambling, shockingly uneven in its register"", a ""gargantuan handbook to modern India and its injustices"". Her admirers describe her as one of India's leading public intellectuals Roy has always led an unconventional life. She left home at 16, went to an architecture school in Delhi, sold cakes on the beaches of Goa, taught aerobics, acted in an indie film, and wrote screenplays before she penned her first novel over five years. The God of Small Things, a riveting family saga inspired by her family childhood,picked up the Man Booker Prize,external- a ""Tiger Woodesian debut"" gushed John Updike - and made Roy a celebrity writer at 35. ""I was the first aerobics instructor to have won the Booker Prize,"" she once wryly remarked. Since then the book has sold more than eight million copies in more than 40 languages, allowing her to live off its royalties in a quiet, upscale south Delhi neighbourhood. Last year, the writer who has said she doesn't care for fame, posed on thecover of Elle magazine,external, because she liked the ""dark-skinned women"" that the magazine featured prominently on its pages. ""I want the world to know that inside this formidable-grey haired older woman there's a ravishing, raven-haired 22-year-old Object of Desire struggling to get out,"" she mused. At home, Roy is loved and loathed in equal measure. Her admirers call her a leading  voice of India's liberal conscience, a public intellectual who champions the underdog. But opponents have burnt her effigies, and disrupted her book launches. She has faced criminal charges of sedition, andshe was sent to prison for a day,externalfor contempt of court while protesting against big dams. Her critics find a lot of her non-fiction writings shrill, naÃ¯ve, adolescent, self-indulgent and simplistic, peddling ""picturesque poverty"". One critic wrote that so often in her essays Roy ""never really gets to grips with the evidence"". Roy was sent to prison for a day for contempt of court while protesting against big dams Roy has often described writing as akin to ""sculpting smoke"" - first you generate it, and then you script it. She toldThe Hindu,externalthat she began The Ministry by writing a few hours a day, and ""when generating smoke"", would write three sentences and fall asleep out of exhaustion, before eventually working long hours. ""The story,"" she told the interviewer, ""was like a map of a city or map of a building"" and described the writing as ""all instinctive... rhythm"". When she finished the book, she told her literary agent that she had to consult the ""folks in my book"" before choosing its publisher. ""Everyone thinks I live alone, but I don't,"" she toldThe Guardian,external, ""My characters live with me."" Roy surely hopes that her readers take to the tortured, oddball cast of characters in her new novel.

US warning over UN human rights body role,"This video can not be played Nikki Haley addresses the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva The US says it is considering what part it will play on the UN's Human Rights Council, highlighting what it calls a ""biased"" stance on Israel. UN ambassador Nikki Haley said it was ""hard to accept"" that resolutions had been passed against Israel, a US ally, but none were considered on Venezuela. She also said not enough had been done to criticise Iran, a ""country with an abysmal human rights record"". Mrs Haley was making her first address to the council in Geneva. ""The United States is looking carefully at this council and our participation in it. We see some areas for significant strengthening,"" she said. ""Being a member of this council is a privilege and no country who is a human rights violator should be allowed a seat at the table. ""It's hard to accept that this council has never considered a resolution on Venezuela and yet it adopted five biased resolutions, in March, against a single country, Israel. It is essential that this council address its chronic anti-Israel bias if it is to have any credibility."" Venezuela has been in political turmoil for month and dozens of protesters have been killed. Since its formation in 2006, the Human Rights Council has been a flawed body because its membership has included serial human rights violators such as China, Russia, Venezuela and Saudi Arabia. That's been a bugbear of the US for years, and Nikki Haley said she would convene a side-meeting on Venezuela during her visit to Geneva to drive home the point. But what seems to anger the Trump administration most about the 47-member body is what she described as its ""chronic anti-Israel bias"". Writing in the Washington Post,external, she complained that the council had passed more than 70 resolutions against Israel but just seven against Iran. The Bush administration, believing the council would treat Israel unfairly, boycotted the body, a decision reversed by Barack Obama. The message from the Trump administration is reform or we're leaving. Nikki Haley wants more competitive elections to the body rather than the regional blocs nominating candidates that are uncontested. It seems to have decided, for now, that it is better to have a seat at the table and to demand reform, rather than exit the council. Criticism of the 47-member council was repeatedon the Twitter feed,externalof the US mission to the UN on Tuesday. Speaking later at the Graduate Institute of Geneva, Mrs Haley said the US did not seek to leave the council but ""we seek to re-establish the council's legitimacy"". The council is able only to order investigations and record criticism of countries it judges to have violated human rights, but it acts as a crucial diplomatic tool. In recent months, it has issued resolutions on human rights in North Korea, Haiti and Myanmar, among other countries. In March, the UK government accused the UNHRC of an ""unacceptable pattern of bias,external"" by singling Israel out as the only country subject to mandatory discussion at every session. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has previously called the body ""an anti-Israel circus which attacks the only democracy in the Middle East and ignores the blatant violations of Iran, Syria and North Korea"". Israel has faced international criticism for allowing Jewish settlements on the West Bank And in 2013, Israelended its working relationship with the groupafter it decided to investigate Jewish settlements in the West Bank. Mrs Haley's comments came after an opening address in Geneva by UN human rights chief Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein calling on Israel to withdraw from territories it captured in the 1967 war. He condemned what he called ""a half-century of deep suffering under an occupation imposed by military force"". Created in 2006 to replace the UN's Human Rights Commission, which was widely discredited for electing member states with questionable track records on human rights All of the 47 members are elected for three-year terms The council aims to shine a spotlight on rights abuses by adopting resolutions, but has faced similar criticism to the commission In 2013,human rights groups complainedwhen China, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Algeria and Vietnam were elected to the body Israel has occupied the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Syrian Golan Heights since the war, 50 years ago this week. The UN also considers the Gaza Strip, which Israel pulled its troops and settlers out of in 2005, as part of occupied Palestinian territory. Israel and the Palestinians blame each other for the failure to resolve the final status of the occupied territories after years of on-off peace talks. Among the current members of the UNHRC is key US ally Saudi Arabia, which has been accused of rights violations, andwhose accession to the group in 2013was criticised.

Graves exhumed in missing mother hunt,"This video can not be played Britain's Got Talent missing mother believed murdered Police investigating the disappearance of a 17-year-old mother 14 years ago are digging up several graves. Acting on new information about Natalie Putt, who disappeared in 2003, West Midlands Police believes it is ""looking at a murder inquiry"". The force said it received a call from a man with ""specific information that has the potential to lead to the person responsible for Natalie's death"". Officers are digging in Ruiton Cemetery in Upper Gornal near Dudley. Family members said in a statement they were ""very upset about the developments and ask that our family is left in peace until such time that we hear definitive news from the police"". Read more news for Birmingham and the Black Country ""In the near 14 years that Natalie has been missing, we have never given up hope of finding her safe and well. Until we know anything to the contrary this remains the case,"" they said. Natalie Putt left her home in Lower Gornal, West Midlands, to go to a shop in September 2003 ""We, her sisters Becky and Lowri, are together, surrounded by pictures of Natalie and have lit candles as a sign of hope."" An image of Ms Putt was broadcast on the ITV show Britain's Got Talent on Friday during a performance by a choir made up of relatives of missing people. Police said while the information prompting the digs predated the broadcast, the programme's timing was ""fortuitous"", with information about Ms Putt coming in as a result. After the show, Rebecca Coggins wrote on Facebook of Ms Putt, her half sister, ""still sad to see you on there but I'm so grateful they featured you tonight"". The operation at Ruiton Cemetery is expected to take several days Ms Putt left her home in Lower Gornal, Dudley, to go to a shop in September 2003, leaving behind her baby son, then aged 11 weeks. An 18-year-old man was arrested in March 2004 in connection with her disappearance, but later released without charge. Since Ms Putt went missing, officers have searched open land close to her home, including underwater searches of rivers and lakes, and farmland in Wombourne, where it is understood she kept horses. Det Insp Ian Iliffe said: ""We have had no positive sightings of Natalie in all these years and there has never been any financial activity connected to her bank accounts or any access to health services across the country, which points to the fact that she is no longer alive."" He said the force also believed at least two people ""know what has led us to this site [the cemetery] and they may have further information which could assist our search"". There are people who know what has led officers to the cemetery, police say He said the specific information the force received came from a man in a telephone box in the Lake Street area of Gornal. ""This crucial information could help us solve this mystery and give Natalie's family the answers they need,"" he added. ""I would urge that person to contact us again and we will ensure the information they have is treated with the strictest confidentiality.""

US may leave UN human rights body,"This video can not be played Nikki Haley addresses the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva The US says it is considering what part it will play on the UN's Human Rights Council, highlighting what it calls a ""biased"" stance on Israel. UN ambassador Nikki Haley said it was ""hard to accept"" that resolutions had been passed against Israel, a US ally, but none were considered on Venezuela. She also said not enough had been done to criticise Iran, a ""country with an abysmal human rights record"". Mrs Haley was making her first address to the council in Geneva. ""The United States is looking carefully at this council and our participation in it. We see some areas for significant strengthening,"" she said. ""Being a member of this council is a privilege and no country who is a human rights violator should be allowed a seat at the table. ""It's hard to accept that this council has never considered a resolution on Venezuela and yet it adopted five biased resolutions, in March, against a single country, Israel. It is essential that this council address its chronic anti-Israel bias if it is to have any credibility."" Venezuela has been in political turmoil for month and dozens of protesters have been killed. Since its formation in 2006, the Human Rights Council has been a flawed body because its membership has included serial human rights violators such as China, Russia, Venezuela and Saudi Arabia. That's been a bugbear of the US for years, and Nikki Haley said she would convene a side-meeting on Venezuela during her visit to Geneva to drive home the point. But what seems to anger the Trump administration most about the 47-member body is what she described as its ""chronic anti-Israel bias"". Writing in the Washington Post,external, she complained that the council had passed more than 70 resolutions against Israel but just seven against Iran. The Bush administration, believing the council would treat Israel unfairly, boycotted the body, a decision reversed by Barack Obama. The message from the Trump administration is reform or we're leaving. Nikki Haley wants more competitive elections to the body rather than the regional blocs nominating candidates that are uncontested. It seems to have decided, for now, that it is better to have a seat at the table and to demand reform, rather than exit the council. Criticism of the 47-member council was repeatedon the Twitter feed,externalof the US mission to the UN on Tuesday. Speaking later at the Graduate Institute of Geneva, Mrs Haley said the US did not seek to leave the council but ""we seek to re-establish the council's legitimacy"". The council is able only to order investigations and record criticism of countries it judges to have violated human rights, but it acts as a crucial diplomatic tool. In recent months, it has issued resolutions on human rights in North Korea, Haiti and Myanmar, among other countries. In March, the UK government accused the UNHRC of an ""unacceptable pattern of bias,external"" by singling Israel out as the only country subject to mandatory discussion at every session. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has previously called the body ""an anti-Israel circus which attacks the only democracy in the Middle East and ignores the blatant violations of Iran, Syria and North Korea"". Israel has faced international criticism for allowing Jewish settlements on the West Bank And in 2013, Israelended its working relationship with the groupafter it decided to investigate Jewish settlements in the West Bank. Mrs Haley's comments came after an opening address in Geneva by UN human rights chief Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein calling on Israel to withdraw from territories it captured in the 1967 war. He condemned what he called ""a half-century of deep suffering under an occupation imposed by military force"". Created in 2006 to replace the UN's Human Rights Commission, which was widely discredited for electing member states with questionable track records on human rights All of the 47 members are elected for three-year terms The council aims to shine a spotlight on rights abuses by adopting resolutions, but has faced similar criticism to the commission In 2013,human rights groups complainedwhen China, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Algeria and Vietnam were elected to the body Israel has occupied the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Syrian Golan Heights since the war, 50 years ago this week. The UN also considers the Gaza Strip, which Israel pulled its troops and settlers out of in 2005, as part of occupied Palestinian territory. Israel and the Palestinians blame each other for the failure to resolve the final status of the occupied territories after years of on-off peace talks. Among the current members of the UNHRC is key US ally Saudi Arabia, which has been accused of rights violations, andwhose accession to the group in 2013was criticised.

Met defends dropping inquiry into attacker,"Attackers Khuram Butt (left) who was known to police and the security service and Rachid Redouane The Metropolitan Police have defended a decision to downgrade an inquiry into one of the men who carried out Saturday night's terror attack. They said Pakistan-born Khuram Butt, 27, of Barking, London, was known to police and MI5 in 2015, but there had been no evidence of a plot. The two other perpetrators were not known to security services. Latest updates In pictures: Tributes to victims How are UK extremists radicalised? A minute's silence was held at 11:00 BST on Tuesday to remember victims and those who were affected. Seven people were killed and 48 injured in the attack which began at 21:58 BST on Saturday night. NHS England said 36 people remained in hospital, with 18 in a critical condition. All 12 people arrested on Sunday after the London attack have now been released without charge. On Tuesday, counter-terror officers were searching a property in Ilford, east London, after entering the address at around 01:30 BST. No arrests had been made, police said. Butt and his two accomplices drove a hired van into pedestrians on London Bridge before stabbing people in the area around Borough Market. All three men were shot dead by police within eight minutes of receiving a 999 call. Butt had featured in a Channel 4 documentary The Jihadis Next Door, broadcast last year. Another of the attackers has been named by police as Rachid Radouane, 30, from Barking. He was a chef who also used the name Rachid Elkhdar and police said he claimed to be Moroccan-Libyan. London attack: What we know so far This video can not be played Khuram Butt was shown in a documentary about extremists Butt featured in a Channel 4 documentary last year about Islamist extremists with links to the jailed preacher Anjem Choudary. The married father-of-two, who worked for London Underground as a trainee customer services assistant for nearly six months last year, could be seen in the programme arguing with police officers in the street, after displaying a flag used by so-called Islamic State in a London park. Two people in Barking, east London, had also raised concerns about Butt, the BBC's home affairs correspondent Dominic Casciani said. One man called the anti-terrorismhotline in 2015, and a woman went to the local police because she was scared Butt was trying to radicalise her children. Metropolitan Police assistant commissioner Mark Rowley said an investigation into Butt began in 2015, but ""there was no intelligence to suggest that this attack was being planned and the investigation had been prioritised accordingly"". The inquiry was ""prioritised in the lower echelons of our investigative work"", Mr Rowley added. Asked if that had been a poor decision, Mr Rowley said he had seen nothing yet to suggest it, according to the BBC's home affairs correspondent, Danny Shaw. At any one time there are around 500 active counter-terrorism investigations concerning 3,000 people of interest. Mr Rowley said work was continuing to understand more about the attackers, ""their connections and whether they were assisted or supported by anyone else"". By Dominic Casciani, BBC Home Affairs correspondent It's still not clear when Khuram Butt got involved in radical Islamist politics, but there is ample evidence that he was involved in the al-Muhajiroun network - certainly in 2015 and potentially at least two years earlier still. The main evidence comes from his appearance in a Channel 4 documentary, The Jihadis Next Door, broadcast last year. The film was a close encounter with part of the ALM network and one of its subjects was Siddhartha Dhar, one of Anjem Choudary's right-hand men. Dhar later skipped bail for Syria. Once there, he appeared in a black mask in an IS execution video. Butt's links may go back further still. Mohammed Shafiq of the Manchester-based Ramadhan Foundation, an anti-extremism group, says that he believes he was verbally assaulted by Butt in 2013 - the day after another ALM follower killed Fusilier Lee Rigby in Woolwich, south-east London. Read more from Dominic James McMullan's family believe he was among those killed. Chrissy Archibald (right) had come to London to be with her fiance. Canadian national Chrissy Archibald, 30, was the first victim to be named. Herfamily said she had died in her fiancÃ©'s armsafter being struck by the attackers' speeding van. The sister of 32-year-old James McMullan, from Hackney, east London, said he was believed to be amongthose who died, after his bank card was found on a body at the scene. A French national was also killed in the attack, according to foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian. The Met have set up a casualty bureau on0800 096 1233and020 7158 0197for people concerned about friends or relatives. More on the victims Avigil was heldat Potters Field Park by the River Thames on Monday evening to remember the victims. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan led the short ceremony. Addressing the attackers, he said: ""We will defeat you. You will not win."" A book of condolences will open on Tuesday at Southwark Council's headquarters in Tooley Street. Prime Minister Theresa May, who has already signed it, said in her message that British values are ""superior to anything offered by the preachers and supporters of hate"". In the days since the attack, Labour has been targeting cuts to the Home Office's policing budget,accusing Theresa Mayof ""letting austerity damage her ability to keep us safe"". Speaking on Tuesday, Mr Khan warned it could be harder to ""foil future terrorist attacks"" if the Conservatives cut police budgets in London. ""The Conservative plans mean another Â£400m of cuts to the Met,"" he said. ""I'm simply not willing to stand by and let this happen."" Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson insisted police numbers ""remained high"" and that the security services did an ""incredible job at keeping people safe"". Mr Johnson toldBBC Breakfast:""All that argument detracts from the responsibility of those scumbags and what they have done.""

'Pink slime' defamation case seeks $5.7bn,"'Pink slime' had been common in fast food restaurants and grocery stores before the TV reports A trial has begun in South Dakota over a meat processer's claim that it was defamed by ABC News reporting that dubbed its product ""pink slime"". Beef Products Inc (BPI) argues ABC and its journalist ruined its reputation in 2012 reports on ""lean finely textured beef"", as the industry calls it. BPI says ABC's ""disinformation campaign"" caused the meat processer's revenues to drop by 80%. They are suing ABC for up to $5.7bn (Â£4.4bn) in damages. During a hearing in January, a lawyer for BPI told the judge that ABC had engaged in ""fake news"". In the reporting by ABC's Jim Avila, the term ""pink slime"" was used 137 times, as he described the process which creates it. Could 'pink slime' be rebranded? The beef trimmings are placed in a centrifuge in order to separate the lean meat from fat, before it is treated with ammonia to remove bacteria. The term ""pink slime"" was coined by Gerald Zirnstein, a former Agriculture Department scientist, who initially used it in an email to colleagues in 2002. Grocery stores across America dropped products containing ""pink slime"" after the ABC reports aired. The processed trimmings were also once found in fast-food served by McDonald's, Taco Bell and Burger King. BPI, which primarily produces the beef trimmings, shut down three of its four production plants following the reports. ABC lawyers argue they are protected under the US constitution's first amendment, which ensures a free press. The television network, which is owned by Walt Disney Company, argues that BPI must prove ABC's reporters acted with ""actual malice"" to harm the company. ""We believe in the principle that people deserve to know what's in the food they eat and are confident that when all the facts are presented in court, ABC's reporting will be fully vindicated,"" said Kevin Baine, a lawyer representing ABC. The trial in the rural town of Elk Point, population 2,000, just north of BPI's headquarters, is expected to last eight weeks. 'Pink slime' off US school menu Could 'pink slime' be rebranded?

Qatar flight ban begins as crisis grows,"Flight tracking technology by the FlightRadar24 website shows the limited route being taken by Qatar Airways flights on Tuesday morning Qatar is backing plans for talks with its regional rivals as a diplomatic row gathers pace. Several countries have cut ties with Qatar, accusing it of supporting terrorism in the Gulf region. Neighbours including Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) have closed their airspace to Qatari planes. Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump has said he was told during his recent visit to Saudi Arabia that Qatar was funding ""radical ideology"". ""During my recent trip to the Middle East I stated that there can no longer be funding of Radical Ideology. Leaders pointed to Qatar - look!"" hetweeted,external. Kuwait - one of the Gulf countries not involved in the dispute - has offered to mediate talks, and Qatar said it was receptive to dialogue. In an interview with Qatar's al-Jazeera network, the Qatari foreign minister said Kuwait's emir would travel to Saudi Arabia on Tuesday for talks. Sheikh Mohammed Bin Abdulrahman al-Thani told Al Jazeera that Qatar was seeking ""a dialogue of openness and honesty"". Six countries - Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Yemen, Libya's eastern-based government and the Maldives - cut diplomatic ties with Qatar on Monday. Bahrain, Saudi Arabia and the UAE have given Qatari nationals two weeks to leave, and banned their own citizens from travelling to Qatar. The Qatar diplomatic crisis explained Why this row has erupted I'm flying through the Gulf: How will this affect me? This video can not be played The evidence of the rift is clear at Doha's airport, the BBC's James Robbins reports The states that joined Monday's move against Qatar, a tiny but gas-rich peninsula, include some of the biggest powers in the Arab world. Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and the UAE closed all transport links by air, land and sea. The UAE and Egypt expelled Qatari diplomats, giving them 48 hours to leave, and Saudi Arabia closed down a local office of al-Jazeera. Food, flights and football at risk Five things you may not know about Qatar Disruption to airspace in the Gulf began on Tuesday morning local time. Doha, Qatar's capital, is a major hub for international flight connections. Airlines affected by the airspace restrictions include Qatar Airways, Etihad Airways and Emirates. When avoiding Saudi Arabia, their massive - and only - neighbour, Qatar's planes are having to take more indirect routes, leading to longer flight times. On Tuesday, Saudi Arabia revoked Qatar Airways' licence and ordered the company's Saudi offices to shut within 48 hours. Saudi pulls Qatar Airways licence In a country reliant on imported food, residents have started to stockpile. ""People have stormed into the supermarket hoarding food, especially imported ones,"" one Doha resident, Eva Tobaji, told Reuters. ""It's chaos - I've never seen anything like this before."" Residents were stockpiling water on Monday A substantial amount of Qatar's food is transported across the border from Saudi Arabia, which is being closed. That is also an important route for construction materials - needed for the energy industry and for the preparations for the 2022 football world cup. Qatar's exports are dominated by oil and gas. They are mostly seaborne, so should not be immediately hit, but the general economic disruption could have an impact if the dispute drags on. That possibility pushed the price of crude oil higher, but only briefly. Qatar is a member of the exporters' group Opec and the dispute could yet undermine the organisation's efforts to raise prices by restricting production. 'A Qatarstrophe' - social media reacts All you need to know about Qatar While the severing of ties was sudden, it has not come out of the blue, as tensions have been building for years, and particularly in recent weeks. Broadly, two key factors drove Monday's decision: Qatar's ties to Islamist groups, and to Iran, Saudi Arabia's regional rival. Wealthy individuals in Qatar are believed to have made donations and the government has given money and weapons to hardline Islamist groups in Syria - Qatar says this is not the case. The Financial Timesalso reports,externalthat Gulf allies were angry that Qatar paid a $1bn (Â£773m) ransom to jihadists and Iranian security officials afterQatari nationals were kidnappedin Iraq and Syria. Saudi Arabia, too, has been accused of funding IS, either directly or by failing to prevent private donors from sending money to the group - allegations it denies. Is Saudi to blame for IS? Analysts also say the timing of the diplomatic withdrawal, two weeks after a visit to Riyadh by President Trump, is crucial. Mr Trump's speech in Saudi Arabia, in which heblamed Iranfor instability in the Middle East and urged Muslim countries to take the lead in combating radicalisation, is likely to have emboldened Gulf allies to act against Qatar. Where key countries stand on IS In the same week as Mr Trump's speech, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and the UAEblocked Qatari news sites, including al-Jazeera. Comments purportedly by Qatar's Emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, criticising Saudi Arabia had appeared on Qatari state media. The government in Doha dismissed the comments as fake, attributing the report to a ""shameful cybercrime"". This video can not be played US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson urges Gulf states to ""address differences"" In the interview with al-Jazeera, Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed Bin Abdulrahman al-Thani said Qatar would not retaliate but was unhappy with regional rivals ""trying to impose their will on Qatar or intervene in its internal affairs"" He said Qatar's emir, at the request of his Kuwaiti counterpart, had cancelled a speech scheduled later for Tuesday, to allow negotiations to proceed calmly The Philippines, which has an estimated 200,000 residents in Qatar, said it had stopped the deployment of workers to the Gulf state Philippines labour official Silvestre Bello told a new conference he feared Filipinos in Qatar would ""be the first victims"" in the event of riots over food shortages.

Contractor held after leaked NSA report,"Ms Winner was arrested on Saturday A US government contractor has been arrested on suspicion of leaking top-secret information to a news outlet. Reality Leigh Winner, 25, allegedly removed classified material from a federal site in the state of Georgia. The charges were announced shortly after news website The Intercept published a National Security Agency briefing about alleged Russian meddling in last year's election. The Trump administration has been seeking to fight leaks to the media. Ms Winner was arrested on 3 June, the justice department said. Putin: Patriotic Russians may be hacking She is a contractor with Pluribus International Corporation and had been employed at an NSA facility in Georgia since February. The accused faces a count of ""gathering, transmitting or losing defence information"". Ms Winner was vocal in her opposition to President Trump on social media, using the hashtag #NeverMyPresident in one post and an expletive in reference to his plans for a border wall. The National Security Agency is headquartered in Fort Meade, Maryland The Intercept's leaked document,externalalleges that Moscow's military intelligence services attempted cyber-attacks on at least one US voting software supplier days before last November's US presidential election. It also accuses the Russians of sending spear-phishing emails to more than 100 local election officials. However, there is no suggestion in the document that the hackers were successful. Ms Winner, who graduated from basic military training at Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio in 2011, was caught after investigators noticed that the leaked document appeared to have been folded or creased. That suggested it had been ""printed and then carried out of a secured space"", according to an FBIaffidavit in support of the arrest warrant,external. Investigators determined that Ms Winner was one of only six people to have printed the document. Examination of her email on her desk computer further revealed that she had exchanged emails with the news outlet, the indictment said. When confronted, Ms Winner admitted printing the report despite not possessing a ""need-to-know"" about its content and said she was aware that the information ""could be used to the injury of the US and to the advantage of a foreign nation"", the affidavit says. US intelligence agencies say Russia tried to get Mr Trump (L) elected The NSA file in question was apparently marked for declassification not before May 2042. Russia: The scandal Trump can't shake American intelligence agencies have accused the Kremlin of trying to interfere in the election to ensure Donald Trump beat Hillary Clinton. Several congressional committees and the FBI are investigating the matter. The president has repeatedly dismissed the story as ""fake news"", arguing that the real scandal is how the allegations are being leaked to the media.

How are UK extremists radicalised?,"Police have identified the three attackers who killed seven people and injured 48 in London on Saturday. What do we know of how UK extremists become radicalised? In her statement following the attack at London Bridge, Prime Minister Theresa May once againhighlighted the role of the internet as a ""safe space""for terrorist recruitment and radicalisation. Over the past five years, we have tracked the flow of foreign fighters into Syria and Iraq, collecting information on nearly 800 Western recruits - often including their social media footprints. Our experience and research suggests that radicalisation rarely happens exclusively online, and that the role of the internet is complex. What we know of the radicalisation trajectory of one of the alleged attackers in London Bridge demonstrates this. A former friend told the BBC's Asian Network that he had reported the man to the authorities after he had become a follower of Ahmad Musa Jibril through the internet. Mr Jibril is a Palestinian-American radical cleric based in Michigan, who developed a prolific online following among Western recruits to the Syrian jihad. More than half of recruits to the so-called Islamic State who we studied for a 2014 report,externalwere following him on Facebook or Twitter - making him an important figure. We found that he did not openly incite his followers to violence, or explicitly encourage them to join the Syrian jihad. Instead, he adopted the role of ideological cheerleader, supporting the principles of armed opposition to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and making people feel guilty for not joining the fight. What we know so far 'I reported the attacker' How has armed policing changed? Tributes left for victims However, our research suggests that the decisive factor in moving people from being extremists in terms of their thoughts and beliefs to becoming terrorists is not online propaganda but offline social networks. It now seems likely that at least one of the attackers had been part of the extremist network al-Muhajiroun - based around the notorious British extremist Anjem Choudary, who wasconvicted of inviting others to support ISin 2016. Choudary also had a YouTube channel, but practically all of his followers were known to him personally and were recruited face to face. Anjem Choudary was jailed for inviting others to support IS What he offered was a sense of community, belonging, and camaraderie within a circle of peers. This builds strong interpersonal bonds based on what has been called ""in-group love"". The internet plays an important role in terms of disseminating information and building the brand of organisations such as IS, but it is rarely sufficient in replacing the potency and charm of a real-world recruiter. Perhaps more than any other radical cluster, the network around Choudary has been linked to scores of attacks, both at home and abroad, and dozens of foreign fighters joining IS in Syria. It is one thing for the internet companies to pull down radical propaganda.

Obituary: Peter Sallis,"Peter Sallis became a household name in the UK in the comedy Last Of The Summer Wine Peter Sallis was best known as the mild-mannered Norman Clegg in Last of the Summer Wine. By the time he first appeared in the role he had already carved out a distinguished career in the theatre and on television. His role as the  flat-capped philosopher made him the longest-serving cast member of the much-loved series. And he reached an even wider audience as the voice of Wallace, the cheese-loving character in the animated series, Wallace and Gromit. Peter Sallis was born on 1 February 1921 in Twickenham, Middlesex. After attending Minchenden Grammar School in Southgate, north London, where the family had moved, he emulated his father and went to work in a bank. The acting bug first struck during his wartime service in the RAF, when he was asked to play the lead role in an amateur production of Noel Coward's play Hay Fever. ""Acting is a matter of instinct,"" he later said when appearing on Desert Island Discs. ""As soon as I was on the stage I just felt so at home."" Peter Sallis (third from right) as Snug in a 1958 production of A Midsummer Night's Dream When hostilities ceased he enrolled at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (Rada). His first professional appearance came in 1946 and for the next six decades he was rarely out of work. Throughout the 1950s he made a name for himself as a reliable character actor playing everything from Shakespeare to Chekhov. His first play with a star cast was a production of Three Sisters, where he appeared alongside Ralph Richardson and Celia Johnson. He had film roles in Anastasia, The VIPs and Wuthering Heights, but it was for his television work that he was better known. He had already acted in two TV plays by writer Roy Clarke, in one playing a transvestite, before landing the role of Clegg in a Comedy Playhouse episode entitled Of Funerals and Fish. Wallace was modelled on Sallis This was successful enough for the BBC to commission a series with the revised title Last of the Summer Wine. Surprisingly, given its later success, the first series was not well received by either audiences or critics. Sallis recalled that filming of the early episodes was enlivened by off-screen arguments between his fellow actors Michael Bates and Bill Owen. ""Michael Bates was somewhere to the right of Margaret Thatcher,"" he said. ""And Bill Owen was somewhere to the left of Lenin. It was all incomprehensible to me as I'd never had a political thought in my life."" The series sparked an appreciation society and a deluge of tourists to the Yorkshire village where it was filmed. Sallis said, ""You would not find me getting up to anything crazy that Clegg gets up to, but I have been very lucky to be a part of it all."" Peter Sallis, Bill Owen and Michael Bates - the original trio in Last of the Summer Wine As well as Summer Wine, Sallis appeared in the Pallisers and The Diary of Samuel Pepys. In addition, he wrote a stage play, End of Term, and also a handful of radio plays. Despite calling himself ""only mildly well-known"", after 30 years of playing Clegg, Sallis's face was one of the most familiar on British television. And in 1992 his voice became recognisable across the world, when his distinctive tones graced the character of Wallace in Nick Park's celebrated animation films. As one half of Wallace and Gromit, he appeared in such modern classics as The Wrong Trousers and A Close Shave. Asked for the inspiration behind Wallace, Nick Park called Sallis his automatic choice and explained how the actor had even helped influence the character's face. He said: ""There was something about his voice that somehow insisted I make Wallace's mouth really wide to get it around the syllables."" Peter Sallis considered himself very fortunate to be in the hands of talented scriptwriters. But his own gentle manner and natural timing certainly helped create comic characters of enduring and wide-ranging appeal. It was with the mild-mannered Clegg that he felt most at home. ""I am like him in many ways. I am fairly retiring and do not like to be the centre of attention. I think I'm well cast.""

Qatar airspace ban begins as crisis grows,"Flight tracking technology by the FlightRadar24 website shows the limited route being taken by Qatar Airways flights on Tuesday morning Qatar is backing plans for talks with its regional rivals as a diplomatic row gathers pace. Several countries have cut ties with Qatar, accusing it of supporting terrorism in the Gulf region. Neighbours including Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) have closed their airspace to Qatari planes. Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump has said he was told during his recent visit to Saudi Arabia that Qatar was funding ""radical ideology"". ""During my recent trip to the Middle East I stated that there can no longer be funding of Radical Ideology. Leaders pointed to Qatar - look!"" hetweeted,external. Kuwait - one of the Gulf countries not involved in the dispute - has offered to mediate talks, and Qatar said it was receptive to dialogue. In an interview with Qatar's al-Jazeera network, the Qatari foreign minister said Kuwait's emir would travel to Saudi Arabia on Tuesday for talks. Sheikh Mohammed Bin Abdulrahman al-Thani told Al Jazeera that Qatar was seeking ""a dialogue of openness and honesty"". Six countries - Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Yemen, Libya's eastern-based government and the Maldives - cut diplomatic ties with Qatar on Monday. Bahrain, Saudi Arabia and the UAE have given Qatari nationals two weeks to leave, and banned their own citizens from travelling to Qatar. The Qatar diplomatic crisis explained Why this row has erupted I'm flying through the Gulf: How will this affect me? This video can not be played The evidence of the rift is clear at Doha's airport, the BBC's James Robbins reports The states that joined Monday's move against Qatar, a tiny but gas-rich peninsula, include some of the biggest powers in the Arab world. Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and the UAE closed all transport links by air, land and sea. The UAE and Egypt expelled Qatari diplomats, giving them 48 hours to leave, and Saudi Arabia closed down a local office of al-Jazeera. Food, flights and football at risk Five things you may not know about Qatar Disruption to airspace in the Gulf began on Tuesday morning local time. Doha, Qatar's capital, is a major hub for international flight connections. Airlines affected by the airspace restrictions include Qatar Airways, Etihad Airways and Emirates. When avoiding Saudi Arabia, their massive - and only - neighbour, Qatar's planes are having to take more indirect routes, leading to longer flight times. On Tuesday, Saudi Arabia revoked Qatar Airways' licence and ordered the company's Saudi offices to shut within 48 hours. Saudi pulls Qatar Airways licence In a country reliant on imported food, residents have started to stockpile. ""People have stormed into the supermarket hoarding food, especially imported ones,"" one Doha resident, Eva Tobaji, told Reuters. ""It's chaos - I've never seen anything like this before."" Residents were stockpiling water on Monday A substantial amount of Qatar's food is transported across the border from Saudi Arabia, which is being closed. That is also an important route for construction materials - needed for the energy industry and for the preparations for the 2022 football world cup. Qatar's exports are dominated by oil and gas. They are mostly seaborne, so should not be immediately hit, but the general economic disruption could have an impact if the dispute drags on. That possibility pushed the price of crude oil higher, but only briefly. Qatar is a member of the exporters' group Opec and the dispute could yet undermine the organisation's efforts to raise prices by restricting production. 'A Qatarstrophe' - social media reacts All you need to know about Qatar While the severing of ties was sudden, it has not come out of the blue, as tensions have been building for years, and particularly in recent weeks. Broadly, two key factors drove Monday's decision: Qatar's ties to Islamist groups, and to Iran, Saudi Arabia's regional rival. Wealthy individuals in Qatar are believed to have made donations and the government has given money and weapons to hardline Islamist groups in Syria - Qatar says this is not the case. The Financial Timesalso reports,externalthat Gulf allies were angry that Qatar paid a $1bn (Â£773m) ransom to jihadists and Iranian security officials afterQatari nationals were kidnappedin Iraq and Syria. Saudi Arabia, too, has been accused of funding IS, either directly or by failing to prevent private donors from sending money to the group - allegations it denies. Is Saudi to blame for IS? Analysts also say the timing of the diplomatic withdrawal, two weeks after a visit to Riyadh by President Trump, is crucial. Mr Trump's speech in Saudi Arabia, in which heblamed Iranfor instability in the Middle East and urged Muslim countries to take the lead in combating radicalisation, is likely to have emboldened Gulf allies to act against Qatar. Where key countries stand on IS In the same week as Mr Trump's speech, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and the UAEblocked Qatari news sites, including al-Jazeera. Comments purportedly by Qatar's Emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, criticising Saudi Arabia had appeared on Qatari state media.

Qatar row threatens air disruption in Gulf,"Qatar's national carrier may be hit hard by the diplomatic spat Qatari planes are to be banned from Egyptian and Saudi air space, as a growing diplomatic row in the Gulf threatens large-scale air disruption. Several countries have cut ties with the tiny Gulf state over accusations of supporting extremism in the region. Air, land and sea links have been halted to the country from Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Egypt and Bahrain. Qatar denies backing militants, including so-called Islamic State (IS), and said the move was ""unjustified"". Sudan's foreign ministry offered to mediate between all sides ""in order to achieve calm and reconciliation"". This major split between powerful Gulf countries, who are also close US allies, comes amid heightened tensions between Gulf countries and their near-neighbour, Iran. Bahrain, Saudi Arabia and the UAE co-ordinated together to set the diplomatic withdrawal into motion, closing all transport ties by air, land and sea to Qatar, a tiny gas-rich peninsula. They have given all Qatari visitors and residents two weeks to leave their territory. The three countries have also banned their citizens from travelling to Qatar. The UAE and Egypt have given Qatari diplomats 48 hours to leave both countries. Travellers hit by grounded flights Five surprising facts about Qatar Food, flights and football at risk Saudi Arabia took it one step further by closing down a local office of Qatar's influential Al Jazeera TV channel. However, the country says it will still allow Qataris to take part in the annual Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca. Egypt, Yemen, Libya's eastern-based government and the Maldives later followed suit in severing diplomatic ties. Saudi Arabia's civil aviation authorities have banned Qatari planes from landing or stopping at its airports, as well as crossing Saudi airspace. Egypt has also closed off its airspace to flights originating from Qatar, and said all flights between the two countries would be halted from 04:00 GMT on Tuesday and ""continue until further notice"". Airlines from many of the affected countries, including Bahrain's Gulf Air, Etihad Airways and Emirates, say they plan to cancel flights to and from the Qatari capital Doha starting from Tuesday morning. Budget carriers, such as Fly Dubai and Air Arabia, have also cancelled routes to Doha. The diplomatic crisis is likely to disrupt Qatar's food imports from Saudi Arabia The national airline, Qatar Airways, meanwhile has suspended its flights to Saudi Arabia. The BBC's Simon Atkinson says the suspension of flights may cause a major problem for the airline, forcing it to alter flight paths and inevitably add time to some flights. There are reports of residents stockpiling food and water, as Qatar is heavily dependent on Saudi Arabia for its food imports. About 40% of Qatar's food is believed to come by lorry from its Gulf neighbour. An official with Iran's Union of Exporters of Agricultural Products was quoted by Fars news agency as saying Tehran could export food to Qatar by sea within 12 hours. While the severing of ties was sudden, it has not come out of the blue, as tensions have been building for years, and particularly in recent weeks. Two weeks ago, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and the UAEblocked Qatari news sites, including Al Jazeera. Comments purportedly by Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani criticising Saudi Arabia had appeared on Qatari state media. US President Trump met Egyptian President Sisi and Saudi King Salman in Saudi Arabia two weeks ago The government in Doha dismissed the comments as fake, attributing the report to a ""shameful cybercrime"". Back in 2014, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and the UAE withdrew their ambassadors from Qatar for several months in protest over alleged interference in their affairs. Why this row has erupted The story behind Qatar 'hack' 'A Qatarstrophe' - social media reacts More broadly, two key factors drove Monday's decision: Qatar's ties to Islamist groups, and the role of Iran, Saudi Arabia's regional rival. While Qatar has joined the US coalition against IS, the Qatari government has repeatedly denied accusations from Iraq's Shia leaders that it provided financial support to IS. Wealthy individuals in the country are believed to have made donations and the government has given money and weapons to hard line Islamist groups in Syria. Qatar is also accused of having links to a group formerly known as the Nusra Front, an al-Qaeda affiliate. The SPA statement accused Qatar of backing these groups, as well as the Islamist Muslim Brotherhood - banned in Gulf countries as a terrorist organisation - and that it ""promotes the message and schemes of these groups through their media constantly"". Saudi Arabia itself is a key backer of Islamist rebels, including hard line jihadist groups, in Syria, and has even been accused of funding IS. Is Saudi to blame for IS? Where key countries stand on IS While on a visit to Riyadh two weeks ago, US President Donald Trump urged Muslim countries to take the lead in combating radicalisation,and blamed Iranfor instability in the Middle East. Experts say this may have emboldened Gulf states to take action, knowing that they had the backing of the Trump administration. Qatar, which is due to host the football World Cup in 2022, was critical of the decision. The foreign ministry said the decisions would ""not affect the normal lives of citizens and residents"". Iran, Turkey and the US have called on all sides to resolve their differences, with US Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, pressing for dialogue.

Sudan's foreign ministry said the country was ""fully ready to undertake all efforts in order to achieve calm and reconciliation that would help serve the interests of the people of the region"". ""Sudan calls on the region's leaders to work together to overcome this dispute,"" it said. Qatar has hosted successive rounds of peace talks between the Sudanese government and rebels from Darfur.

Leaders: No 'knee-jerk' reaction to terror,"The Liberal Democrat and SNP leaders have said civil liberties should not be sacrificed in the response to the London terror attack. Lib Dem Tim Farron said there was no evidence to support a widening of surveillance powers. And the SNP's Nicola Sturgeon warned against reforms that could ""undermine our own freedoms"". The two leaders both warned against a ""knee-jerk"" reaction during the Question Time special in Edinburgh. They faced questions separately on a range of subjects including Scottish independence and Brexit. BBC Election Live: Rolling updates Guide: Where the parties stand on security Labour: Austerity has damaged safety Following the London terror attack, Prime Minister Theresa May said ""things need to change"" in the fight against terrorism, calling for more to be done about online extremism and for a review into whether security services needed extra powers. Both the SNP and the Lib Dems opposed last year's Investigatory Powers Act, branded a ""snoopers' charter"" by critics, which gives intelligence agencies the power to collect large volumes of data from electronic devices. This video can not be played Tim Farron said he was a political leader not a religious one Ms Sturgeon said she would ""listen very carefully"" to any request for more powers but said these were already ""wide-ranging"". ""What we've got to guard against is the security services having so much data that they can't then make sense of it,"" she said. ""We must make sure that in our determination... to keep the population safe we don't start to undermine our own freedoms and civil liberties, because these are what makes us who we are."" Mr Farron, whose manifesto promises to ""roll back"" surveillance powers, said the ""desire for something to be done is utterly right"". But he said the problem was a lack of resources, not a ""lack of surveillance"". Agencies could already ""follow and track criminals"" he said, but did not have ""sufficient pairs of eyes"". ""The widening of powers is not something that the evidence is there to support,"" he added. The two leaders were also quizzed about their demands for referendums - on the Brexit deal for the Lib Dems, and Scottish independence for the SNP. This video can not be played SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon faced questions about her call for another independence referendum Both argued they were trying to do what was ""right"" rather than making a political calculation when the public demand for the polls was questioned. A woman in the audience asked Mr Farron: ""We're having the general election to decide who's giving us the best (Brexit) deal - why do we need another referendum?"" How terror attack will influence campaign Corbyn and May clash over security ""We had a general election two years ago, we appear to be having another one,"" he answered, arguing the deal would be ""stitched up behind closed doors"" and that voters should get the final say. The Lib Dem leader, who has faced repeated questions during the campaign on his views on homosexuality, was asked whether there was a ""conflict"" between his faith and his politics. ""Not in the slightest,"" he said. ""If you're a liberal you fight for everybody's right to be who they are. I honestly don't understand the conflict that people think is there."" Ms Sturgeon faced some hostile questions from the audience about her call for another independence referendum before the UK leaves the EU. When she lost the last vote on independence, she had not expected to be talking about another referendum, she said - but the alternative was ""we have to put up with Brexit regardless of what it is"". She was also pressed on the SNP's record in government in Scotland - with one man in the audience saying she was good at speaking about independence but ""hopeless"" at actually governing. She defended her record on the NHS and education and said it was ""legitimate"" for such questions to be raised. But she added: ""On Thursday we're not choosing a Scottish government, we're choosing MPs who will go to Westminster to vote on public spending."" Voters should judge her record at the next Scottish Parliament election, she added. The two leaders were also asked about working with other parties after 8 June - Mr Farron ruled out entering a coalition, while Ms Sturgeon said she would ""certainly"" seek to join an alliance to keep the Tories out of power if the Parliamentary numbers made it possible.

Making sense of the final election polls,"Confused about what is likely to happen on Thursday? That would not be surprising. The polls have, after all, produced very divergent results. In the last few days, for example, one has put the Conservative lead over Labour as low as one point and another as high as 12. So how should you try and make sense of the final polls as they appear on Wednesday and Thursday? And what should you look out for as the results themselves are eventually declared on Thursday night? There is one crucial statistic to keep in your mind in the next few days. At the last election in 2015 the Conservatives were seven points ahead of Labour in the national vote and that secured them an overall majority of 12. So, any poll that puts the Conservative lead at six points or less is suggesting that the Conservatives will be less far ahead of Labour than two years ago - and, consequently, could potentially be at risk of losing their overall majority. Conversely, any poll that reckons the Conservatives are ahead by eight points or more implies that the party is likely to make gains from Labour and thus increase its majority. Election 2017 poll tracker: How the parties compare General election: What you need to know Election latest What this means is that, at the moment at least, some polls are pointing towards the Conservative lead narrowing as compared with 2015 while others suggest that it will be bigger. Meanwhile, on average, they point to the same seven-point lead that the Tories won two years ago. Little wonder that the outcome of the election looks uncertain. Also worth keeping an eye on are polls about what will happen in Scotland, where the SNP won 56 out of 59 seats last time. That remarkable feat will be difficult for the nationalists to repeat. Both the polls and recent devolved and local election results suggest there has been something of a Conservative revival north of the border - which could deliver the party potentially vital extra seats at the expense of the SNP. But what about the night itself? What should you look out for then? The first intimation of the result will come from an exit poll jointly commissioned by the BBC, ITV, and Sky. Interviewers from GFK and Ipsos MORI will be approaching voters outside 144 polling stations across the length and breadth of Britain and asking them to indicate on a mock ballot paper which way they have just voted. Analysed by a team of election experts, the data will provide the basis for making an estimate of how many seats each party will win. Do not expect this estimate to be exactly right! However, the record of the exit poll at the last three elections suggests it should give a good indication of what roughly the result will be. Just an hour or so later, we should get the first result - from Houghton and Sunderland South, where the local council prides itself in always being the first to declare. It is a safe Labour seat, and so should not change hands. But it will be the first indication of whether the exit poll is at least roughly right or not. That is because the poll produces an estimate of the likely outcome in every single seat. So in the early part of the night we can compare the actual result with what the exit poll forecast it would be. By 01:00 we should have around a dozen results, and they should give us a good idea of whether the poll is broadly right - or not. If it is not right, expect a new forecast to appear at around this point. Seats that could decide the election Quiz: How well do you know your constituency? How many women might win power? But, of course, the outcome will eventually be settled in the marginal seats, that is the seats where the result last time was close, and which are thus most likely to change hands. So far as Labour-held marginals are concerned, keep an eye out for Tooting and Wrexham, expected to declare at 01:30 or so. If the Conservatives win either of these it could well be an indication that Theresa May is on course to increase her majority quite substantially. If Darlington were to be won by the Conservatives, then her hopes of winning a landslide could be set to be fulfilled. The first Conservative-held marginals - Bury North and Thurrock - are not expected until a little later at around 02:00. If the Conservatives were to lose either of these it could be a sign that the party is at risk of losing its majority. Meanwhile, by this time the first results from Scotland should start to come in, giving us an idea of the likely shape of the very different but potentially important battle there. After that expect a flood of results. The BBC's forecast of the outcome in seats will be periodically updated to help make sense of the direction in which the election is headed. But as to when it will be safe to go to bed clear (rather than confused) about who has won, that depends on whether the result is close - or not!
