Johnson sorry for Iran remarks 'anxiety',"This video can not be played Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe's husband said ""she was just a mum on holiday"" Boris Johnson has said he is sorry if his remarks about a British-Iranian mother caused anxiety to her family. The foreign secretary had been criticised for saying Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who has been jailed in Iran, had been training journalists there. A charity said the remarks could worsen her sentence. She had been in Iran on holiday when she was arrested, it said. Mr Johnson told MPs he was sorry if his words were ""so taken out of context"" as ""to cause any kind of anxiety"". The UK government had ""no doubt"" she was on holiday when she was arrested, he said. This video can not be played Mr Johnson called the Iranian foreign minister, Javad Zarif, about Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's case Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was detained at Tehran Airport in April 2016 and is serving a five-year sentence for allegedly plotting to topple the government in Tehran, although the official charges have never been made public. She has worked for the Thomson Reuters Foundation and BBC Media Action (the corporation's international development charity), but has always said the 2016 visit was so her daughter Gabriella, who is three, could meet her grandparents. She was summoned back to court on 4 November, where Mr Johnson's comment was cited as new evidence as to what she was doing in Iran. Mr Johnson had told the Commons Foreign Affairs Select Committee on 1 November: ""When I look at what Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe was doing, she was simply teaching people journalism, as I understand it. ""[Neither] Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe nor her family has been informed about what crime she has actually committed. And that I find extraordinary, incredible."" Fears after Boris Johnson remark She was 'punished without a crime' Husband's plea for Briton held in Iran Her husband, Richard Ratcliffe, said Mr Johnson had done a ""good thing"" in clarifying his comments, and asked him to try to visit his wife in Iran. ""It's important that the judiciary understands that the British government thinks she is innocent,"" he  said. He said he hoped his wife and daughter, a British citizen - who is with her grandparents in Iran - can return home before Christmas. Monique Villa, chief executive of the Thomson Reuters Foundation, said she saw a ""direct correlation"" between Mr Johnson's original remarks and Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's treatment in Iran. She said Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe had ""never trained journalists"" at the charity. This video can not be played Boris Johnson is asked if he will apologise to Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe's family Mr Johnson told MPs his previous remarks to the foreign affairs committee ""could have been clearer"". He said: ""My point was that I disagreed with the Iranian view that training journalists was a crime - not that I wanted to lend any credence to Iranian allegations that Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe has been engaged in such activity. ""I accept that my remarks could have been clearer in that respect, and I'm glad to provide this clarification."" Later, when MP Layla Moran asked him if he would apologise to Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's family, he said: ""Of course I am sorry if any words of mine have been so taken out of context and so misconstrued as to cause any kind of anxiety for the family."" He said he did not believe his comments had ""had any impact on the judicial process"" in Iran. By Ben Wright, BBC political correspondent: Boris Johnson is in hot water again. It will not, however, result in his dismissal from the cabinet. In an effort to hose the situation down and minimise any damage to Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's case, the foreign secretary told his Iranian counterpart that he accepted his remarks at the committee ""could have been clearer"". He said he was seeking to condemn ""the Iranian view that training journalists was a crime."" But that is not what he said to the Commons committee last week - and Labour MPs are furious at this latest diplomatic fumble by the Foreign Secretary. The foreign secretary said his comments had no impact on the case in Iran, a view echoed by his Iranian counterpart. That certainly helps Mr Johnson weather this latest storm. But more fundamentally, Theresa May does not have the political strength to dismiss one of the Cabinet's big Brexit-supporting beasts. More from Ben: Boris Johnson weathers latest storm This video can not be played Mr Ratcliffe maintains his wife is innocent Mr Johnson had earlier called the Iranian foreign minister, Javad Zarif, to say his remarks provided ""no justifiable basis"" for further legal action and that he intended to visit Iran before the end of the year to discuss the case. Mr Zarif told the foreign secretary the developments in the case over the weekend were ""unrelated"" to Mr Johnson's remarks, a Foreign Office statement added. The Iranian judiciary's High Council for Human Rights said Mr Johnson's comments ""shed new light"" on the charity worker and proved Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe ""had visited the country for anything but a holiday"". Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe denies all the allegations against her, but lost her final appeal in April. She has since faced two more charges relating to an accusation of plotting to topple the government in Tehran. Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe had been eligible for parole under the early release scheme from 23 November. Mr Ratcliffe told the Press Association that his wife could now face a fresh trial before that date to block her chance of freedom. ""I think the one thing the foreign secretary could do to make amends would be if he went to visit her in the next few weeks before her trial,"" he said. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe says she was in Iran so her daughter could meet her grandparents By Rana Rahimpour, BBC Persian Service: The case of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe is first and foremost a story of terrible personal suffering for a young woman, her husband and their baby girl. Eighteen months into a five-year sentence, Ms Zaghari-Ratcliffe faces the prospect of up to 16 years in an Iranian jail. It is also, however, a story of an internal power struggle in Iran, as well as of the nation's deeply difficult relationship with the UK.

Sky threatens to shut down Sky News,"Sky has threatened to shut down Sky News if the news channel proves to be an obstacle in Rupert Murdoch's 21st Century Fox bid. Regulators are investigating the deal amid concerns that Mr Murdoch's media empire could become too powerful. Sky toldthe Competition and Markets Authority (CMA),externalthat the regulator should not assume ""the continued provision"" of Sky News. BBC media editor Amol Rajan said it was a ""credible threat"". Fox owns 39% of Sky but wants full control of the satellite broadcaster. In a submission made to the CMA last month, but published by the regulator on Tuesday, Sky said it ""would likely be prompted to review"" its position if ""the continued provision of Sky News in its current form unduly impeded merger and/or other corporate opportunities available in relation to Sky's broader business"". This would particularly be the case if shareholders objected to the merger not happening, Sky said. Closing Sky News would only be an option of last resort, and the broadcaster would try to find a buyer for the media company before that eventuality, the BBC understands. ""The messaging coming through is alarming for supporters of Sky News but it runs completely counter to all the investment that there has been in the channel in all the recent months and years,"" said Joey Jones, a political correspondent at Sky News for 16 years and now head of public affairs at PR firm Weber Shandwick. But he said the threat was a risky move by Sky: ""Inevitably this will be perceived by those who are already hostile to the proposed takeover, particularly in the political arena, as sabre rattling and as a perceived threat by the company"". Media editor Mr Rajan said that Sky News lost ""an awful lot of money"". ""It loses tens of millions of pounds, and I think the independent directors of Sky are sending a very clear message... that if they had to choose, maybe they'd prefer for commercial reasons to do the deal with 21st Century Fox rather than continue to fund the losses at Sky News."" Probe into Murdoch's Sky bid confirmed What are the issues in Fox's Sky deal? The submission comes a day after reports that Fox has discussed selling ""most"" of its business,including its Sky stake, to Disney. Fox has faced a number of hurdles in its bid to buy Sky, including the CMA investigation and opposition from some politicians. Some fear the deal would give Rupert Murdoch's family too much control over the UK media. The Murdoch family owns controlling stakes in both News Corporation, which owns UK newspapers such as the Sun and the Times, as well as Fox, which operates in film and TV. Fox boosted by reports of Disney talks Sky-Fox deal faces further hurdles At least two killed and 1,000 structures destroyed as wildfires rage in Los Angeles In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Why does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?

Adopted baby murder dad jailed for life,"A jury unanimously found Matthew Scully-Hicks guilty of murdering 18-month-old Elsie A man who murdered his 18-month-old daughter just two weeks after formally adopting her has been handed a life sentence. Matthew Scully-Hicks, 31, of Delabole, Cornwall, was told he must serve at least 18 years in jail before being considered for release. The killer inflicted a catalogue of injuries on Elsie at their Cardiff home in the eight months he had care of her. Elsie's birth family said they had hoped one day to be reunited with her. In a victim impact statement, they said they were ""numb with pain"" and that her birth grandmother had hoped to become her legal guardian before she was put up for adoption. Baby murder 'a rogue' adoption Elsie Scully-Hicks: Dad of adopted baby guilty of murder Baby Elsie's catalogue of injuries 999 call made four days before Elsie died Baby Elsie died four days after being violently shaken in May 2016. A four-week trial heard Elsie's catastrophic injuries included a fractured skull, bruises and a broken leg. Scully-Hicks had denied murder butwas found guilty at Cardiff Crown Court on Monday. Sentencing him, Judge Nicola Davies described the murder as a gross abuse of trust. She said there had been a failure to identify an earlier injury by medical staff in November 2015, which meant child protection measures were not triggered. ""Tragically, it was an opportunity missed,"" said the judge. Achild practice review,externalis now expected to take place which will investigate the role of agencies in the case and look at whether lessons can be learned to prevent future tragedies. This video can not be played Matthew Scully-Hicks made a 999 call two months before Elsie died claiming she fell down stairs Judge Davies told Scully-Hicks that his actions were aggravated by his daughter's vulnerability, age and the position of trust. ""You had, and were aware that you had, a predisposition to injure your adoptive daughter,"" she said. ""You took no steps to prevent a recurrence of the earlier incidents when Elsie suffered injuries as a result of your actions. ""No remorse has been shown. Scully-Hicks said he did not know how Elsie sustained her fatal injuries Judge Davies, when sentencing Scully-Hicks, took into account a victim impact statement - which was not read in court - provided by Elsie's birth family. In the statement, which can now be reported, they said they were ""numb with pain"". Elsie was named Shayla O'Brien by her birth family when she was born in November 2014. Speaking on behalf of the family, Elsie's birth grandmother Sian O'Brien said: ""I accept that at the time of giving birth my daughter was living a chaotic lifestyle and was not in a position to care for Shayla and she was removed from the hospital five days after birth by social services. ""As a family, we continued to have contact with Shayla whilst she was in the care of the foster family."" Ms O'Brien said all of Elsie's family were ""extremely attached to her and loved her very much"". She said: ""In January 2015, I started proceedings in the family court to become the legal guardian for Shayla. ""I wanted to bring her up in a happy, healthy and warm family environment, that was all taken away from me when social services and the family court decided I would not be able to cope."" A decision was made that Elsie, who was renamed by her future adoptive parents, would be put up for adoption in May 2015. Ms O'Brien said the family had been devastated but hoped that one day the little girl would be reunited with them. However they were visited by social services in January 2017 and were told Elsie had died in May the previous year. ""In itself this was devastating news but to then be informed that one of the parents who had adopted her had been charged with murder and was allegedly responsible for her death was completely incomprehensible,"" Ms O'Brien added. ""A person who had been deemed by the authorities to be a fit and proper person to bring up my granddaughter was responsible for her death, and they took her from me telling me I would be unable to cope."" She added:  ""We are numb with pain and hurt deep in the knowledge that Shayla was loved unconditionally by us all as a family and knowing that had she not been taken away from us, she would still be alive today."" During his trial, Scully-Hicks claimed he never harmed Elsie and said she must have suffered her fatal injuries after he changed her for bed at home on May 25 last year. She died at Cardiff's University Hospital of Wales on 29 May 2016 after doctors determined she could not be saved and her ventilator was switched off. A pathologist said her injuries were ""very typical"" of a shaken baby. A CT scan showed she hadbleeding on the brainand a post-mortem examination revealed she had also suffered broken ribs, a fractured left femur and a fractured skull. There was alsohaemorrhaging within both of Elsie's retinas- associated with inflicted trauma or injury.

Sir Alistair Graham says Prince Charles should be accountable to public scrutiny. The committee, which he chaired from 2003 to 2007, advises the prime minister on ethical standards across public life in England. BBC Panorama has found that the Prince of Wales campaigned to alter climate-change agreements without disclosing his private estate had an offshore financial interest in what he was promoting His private estate says the prince had no direct involvement in its investments.
A Clarence House spokesman said the prince had ""certainly never chosen to speak out on a topic simply because of a company that it may have invested in"". The investments of Prince Charles' private estate are the latest to be revealed in the data leak dubbed the Paradise Papers. The financial affairs of hundreds of politicians, multinationals, celebrities and high-net-worth individuals, some of them household names, have been revealed.

Ryan MorrisonBBC News Online John Shenton, a Jersey tax expert, says the Paradise Papers story could harm the island's reputation. ""There is nothing to suggest anybody has done anything wrong, anybody has done anything illegal or Jersey has done anything wrong,"" he said. ""What you have is a perception - it is hard to change perception - that something isn't right here. ""Reputation matters a lot and it is very difficult if somebody sullies your reputation, it is hard to get it back,"" he added. The Paradise Papers contain 13m documents obtained from law firm Appleby and others. Appleby described it as an ""illegal data breach"" and as a hack.

Owner avoided taxes on shopping centre,"The St Enoch Centre is a large mall in the centre of Glasgow Private equity firm Blackstone avoided tens of millions of pounds in UK taxes on property deals in Glasgow and London, the Paradise Papers show. The documents reveal it used offshore companies to purchase and operate the St Enoch Shopping Centre in Glasgow and Chiswick Business Park in London. The papers show how accountancy firms mapped out strategies to minimise or avoid every significant tax. Blackstone said its investments were ""wholly compliant with UK tax laws"". Follow all the latest updates Blackstone avoided UK taxes on St Enoch Centre Celtic shareholder Dermot Desmond's private jet firm used tax haven Apple's secret tax bolthole revealed Mrs Brown's Boys stars 'put money offshore' Blackstone is one of the world's biggest private equity groups and its founder and chief executive Stephen Schwarzman is a close confidant of President Trump. Leaked documents from the offshore law firm Appleby, seen by BBC Scotland, show for the first time how the group structured two major UK property deals. Top accountancy firms issued long documents to Blackstone outlining how it could use trusts in the tax haven of Jersey and a complex structure of companies in Luxembourg for the purchase of both Chiswick Park and the St Enoch Centre. Blackstone's Stephen Schwarzman is a close confidant of President Trump There is no suggestion that the plans were illegal but campaigners the Tax Justice Network described the structures Blackstone used as an ""economic fiction"". They told the BBC it was clear from the data in the papers that the principal purpose of the structures, which are virtually identical, was to avoid tax. The leaked documents show the tax structure was designed to ""minimise"" taxes US tax expert Reuven Avi-Yonah, from the University of Michigan law school, said the documents gave a ""rare"" insight into company structures that even tax authorities did not often see. ""If HMRC becomes aware of the fact that this is a common type of structuring then they are more likely to challenge it because they will be aware they are losing a lot of revenue,"" he said. Chiswick Business Park in west London is host to dozens of companies Blackstone purchased Chiswick Park, a 33-acre office development in west London, in 2011 for Â£480m. The majority of the site, which hosts the UK headquarters of companies such as Pokemon, Avon and shopping channel QVC, was sold to the Chinese government for Â£780m in 2014. The data suggests Blackstone's tax structures allowed it to avoid about Â£19m in stamp duty on the purchase. The tax structure also meant it could avoid tax of up to Â£30m annual rental income and capital gains tax on the sale of the business park, which could have been tens of millions of pounds. Blackstone still owns the St Enoch Centre In 2013, the private equity giant also bought the St Enoch Centre in Glasgow, a large city centre shopping complex housing almost 100 stores, for about Â£190m. Documents show it would have avoided stamp duty of Â£7.6m and corporate tax on up to Â£10m annual rental income. The documents show the Jersey trusts allowed no Stamp Duty Land Tax (SDLT) to be paid on St Enoch Both the St Enoch Centre, which Blackstone still owns, and Chiswick Park were already held in property trusts known as JPUTs, in the tax haven of Jersey, when it bought them. This allowed the firm to purchase the properties without paying millions of pounds in UK stamp duty. George Turner, from the Tax Justice Network, told the BBC: ""What they are doing is buying into the trust so when the original owners sold the property to Blackstone, then they weren't selling the property itself. ""They were selling an interest in the trust that owns the property and because that trust is owned offshore, they can avoid stamp duty."" Paradise Papers: All you need to know Under the tax structure revealed in the leaked documents, the Jersey trusts were owned and funded by a series of companies that Blackstone registered in Luxembourg. Money for the purchase of the properties was filtered through the Luxembourg companies from central Blackstone funds in the form of inter-company loans. The interest payments on these loans, which were effectively passed from one Blackstone company to another, could be written off against the profits of the rental income, meaning that minimal tax was paid in Luxembourg. In the case of Chiswick Park, a 33-page document was provided by accountancy firm PwC outlining the structure to be used. Another of the ""Big Four"" accountancy firms, Deloitte, issued a 67-page document for a similar tax structure for the St Enoch Centre. The job of law firm Appleby, who held the documents seen by the BBC, was to implement the structures outlined by the accountants. The central purpose of which was to avoid: Stamp Duty - by holding the property in an offshore trust in Jersey, and maintain them as collective investment schemes Income Tax - on the rental income, by funding the acquisition through a series of inter-company loans and Profit Participating Loans (PPLs), the interest payments on which can be used to write off against profits Capital Gains Tax - on disposal, thanks again to the Jersey trust George Turner, from the Tax Justice Network, said: ""The language really is quite shocking in places because it's so clear and blatant what the intention is. ""What you have here is a whole myriad of companies being set up, mostly in Luxembourg but also you have this trust structure in Jersey, and it seems to be to all intents and purposes an economic fiction."" Profit from rental income at the St Enoch Centre had normally been about Â£10m a year. The structure advised by Deloitte allowed Blackstone to turn that into tax free income, by writing it off against interest charges generated from the loans its companies had made to each other. In some years, just a few thousand pounds appears to have been paid by the Blackstone Luxembourg companies owning St Enoch and Chiswick. Mr Turner said: ""What appears to be happening is that the rental income which is coming in, the companies receiving that are then borrowing huge amounts of money from other companies which are part of the Blackstone Group. ""Now when they borrow that money, they need to pay interest on it and those interest payments destroy any profitability in those companies. ""They're borrowing money from themselves and they can claim a tax deduction on that."" Blackstone said: ""Blackstone's investments are wholly compliant with UK and international tax laws and regulations. ""The property investment structures in question were acquired from institutional investors and are of a type commonly used for decades for investments in UK real estates, including by listed companies and a variety of institutional investors, and were adopted after appropriate advice was taken from leading tax and legal advisors."" Deloitte, which advised on the St Enoch purchase, declined to comment. PwC, who advised on Chiswick Park, said ""The advice we provide is given in accordance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations, including proper disclosure to tax authorities.""

Isle of Man says tax laws 'transparent',"The island's government has invited the UK Treasury to investigate its aircraft importation practices The Isle of Man has said it does not welcome those ""seeking to evade or aggressively avoid taxes"", following the Paradise Papers revelations. Its tax practices have come under scrutiny after documents showed Formula 1 champion Lewis Hamilton avoided tax on his Â£16.5m luxury jet by importing it via the island in 2013. Chief Minister Howard Quayle said the Isle of Man was ""open and transparent"". The UK Treasury is now investigating the importation of jets to the island. The island that swapped donkey rides for offshore cash Lewis Hamilton 'dodged' VAT on private jet Isle of Man law 'sanctioned' tax dodge On Monday, the BBC's Panorama programme said Hamilton was given a Â£3.3m VAT refund after he imported a Bombardier Challenger 605 into the Isle of Man. While the 32-year-old F1 driver's planned use of the jet was predominantly for business purposes, the programme saw documents which suggested he  intended to make private flights about a third of the time - with his social media accounts showing evidence of this. To try and get round EU and UK rules banning VAT refunds on aircraft used by private individuals, Hamilton's advisers formed a VAT-registered leasing business on the Isle of Man, the leaked documents held by offshore law firm Appleby suggest. The jet was then leased back to Hamilton. This video can not be played Paradise Papers: How Lewis Hamilton got a Â£3.3m VAT refund In an emergency statement to the Isle of Man government, Mr Quayle said an internal review of the practice found no evidence of wrongdoing and he said he had no reason to believe its Customs and Excise Division had been involved in the mistaken refunding of VAT. In October, the Manx government invited the Treasury to conduct an assessment of the practice of importing business jets via the island into the EU, and promised ""all appropriate action"" would be taken against individuals or companies if there was any evidence of wrongdoing. Mr Quayle confirmed that the assessment had begun, with the ""scoping"" of it due to be published this month and work to be completed in 2018. ""The VAT treatment of the importation of aircraft into the EU is a highly technical and complex area in which the Isle of Man follows the same policy, laws and rules as the United Kingdom,"" he said. ""However, we acted swiftly and decisively and have taken action to demonstrate that the Isle of Man is a well-regulated, open and transparent member of the international community."" Panorama also raised questions about a law passed by the Isle of Man government in 2005 - before the European Savings Directive (EUSD) began. The EUSD was introduced to stop people from one part of Europe putting assets in an account in another country without declaring it. Most of the people targeted by EUSD were therefore already evading tax. Tax adviser Mark Morris claimed an Isle of Man regulator was aware the new law would help tax evaders. Paradise Papers: All you need to know Live: Paradise Papers offshore leak Chief Minister Howard Quayle said he was proud of how the island had taken the international tax agenda foward Mr Quayle said the law was never utilised on the island and tried to distance his administration from the decision to enact it. ""It is difficult for any administration today to understand or attempt to justify the thinking made by an administration nearly 13 years ago,"" he said. ""We are considering all the allegations made to determine next steps and what action can be taken in relation to the past."" Mr Quayle added that ""where the Isle of Man's integrity is challenged we will not be complacent"", and he was ""proud of the role"" the island had taken ""in moving the international tax agenda forward"". ""However it cannot - and should not - be overlooked that to truly combat evasion and abuse, action not only needs to be global but it also needs to be implemented consistently and effectively.""

The tax professionals' responsibility,"In the controversy over the Paradise Papers, questions have been raised about the role, responsibilities and liability of professionals in the creation and facilitation of tax avoidance schemes. There are multiple measures in place already to prevent lawyers and accountants establishing and marketing such schemes. But are they making an impact? Paradise Papers: All you need to know Apple's secret tax bolthole revealed The island that swapped donkey rides for offshore cash The disclosure of tax avoidance schemes (DOTAS) regime came into force over a decade ago, which makes anyone marketing a scheme disclose it to HMRC. HMRC then issue a scheme number, which the tax payer has to put on his or her tax return.  When that number is seen, the revenue will raise enquiries. The fine for failing to disclose a scheme is severe - up to Â£1m - for the professional who devises it or advises that is lawful, whilst for users who don't report it, the penalties start at Â£5,000 per offence. HMRC also now has the power to ask for the disputed tax up front under what are known as Accelerated Payment Notices.  This means that the taxpayer has ""skin in the game"" rather than getting an automatic deferral of his tax liability. If a court then rules that the scheme is unlawful, HMRC can attach a ""follower"" notice to it, meaning others in the same scheme receive the same treatment. The Solicitors Regulatory Authority requires solicitors in England and Wales to comply with their principles, meaning they must ""uphold the rule of law and the proper administration of justice"", and ""act with integrity"". It is an ethical foundation of practice as a lawyer that you must uphold the rule of law, rather than tell people how to defeat it, so it goes without saying that solicitors should not give advice to help clients commit crime, such as tax evasion. So far, so obvious. However, solicitors advising people about how to structure their assets to minimise their tax are able to do so, provided they give advice within the law. This means as a lawyer is required to act in the best interest of their client, they must advise on the best way to reduce their tax bill if their client wants to have more money and pay less tax. But acting in the best interest of your client probably now includes providing advice about the moral outrage that comes with reducing a tax bill substantially. A likely question to a client would be: ""How would you feel if this appears on the front page of a national newspaper?"" HMRC are rolling out new criminal offences to target professionals involved in tax evasion There is, or certainly should be, a strict ethical dividing line between tax avoidance and tax evasion. If a client asks a solicitor for advice which involves breaking the law - which amounts to evasion - a solicitor must not give that advice or arrange a transaction which helps the client evade tax. New criminal offences are being rolled out by HMRC which will criminalise professionals involved in tax evasion.  They include the somewhat convoluted ""failure to prevent the facilitation of tax evasion"", which came into force in September. These offences are not retrospective. ""However, that is not to say they won't make a difference,"" says Jessica Parker, a partner at the solicitors Corker Binning. ""They reflect the rising tide of moral opprobrium directed at the offshore tax industry. ""Advisors will now tread extremely carefully so as to avoid falling onto the wrong side of the notoriously blurred line between legitimate tax avoidance and illegitimate tax evasion."" There are a raft of laws to ensure that people or companies who are resident in the UK pay the correct tax. There has been tax information exchange agreements for years, under which, for example, Switzerland and the Channel Islands send information directly to HMRC. That transparency is likely to be increased as the Common Reporting Standard - a multilateral agreement for automatic exchange of financial information to prevent cross border tax evasion and hiding assets - takes effect. According to Clare Munro, a tax partner at accountants Lubbock Fine, things are improving. ""Whilst the global tax system is not perfect, much has been done to provide people with incentives to pay what is due,"" she said. ""There will always be those who push the boundaries, but there's been a sea change in public attitude to tax avoidance similar to public attitudes to smoking which, along with HMRC's greater focus on tackling avoidance, is making artificial and aggressive structures a thing of the past.""

Texas gunman 'escaped mental hospital',"This video can not be played Warning signs of a potential mass shooter The gunman who killed 26 churchgoers in Texas fled from a mental health clinic in 2012, according to a police report. El Paso officers who detained Devin Kelley five years ago were told he was ""a danger to himself and others"". Kelley had been sent to the hospital after he was court-martialled for assaulting his ex-wife and stepson during a stint in the US Air Force. He was ""attempting to carry out death threats"" against ""his military chain of command"", the report states. Officials say the assault charge should have legally barred him from owning guns. El Paso police arrested Kelley at a bus terminal in downtown El Paso in June 2012,according to a police report first reported by KPRC in Houston.,external The small town where everyone knows a victim Trump rejects stricter gun checks Why are US mass shootings getting more deadly?

This video can not be played Texas shooting: How to spot a hoax The person who reported him missing from the facility told police Kelley ""suffered from mental disorders"". Kelley ""had already been caught sneaking firearms onto Holloman Air Force Base"", the report adds. Later that year, Kelley pleaded guilty in a military court to repeatedly assaulting his wife and toddler stepson. Sutherland Springs: The victims America's gun culture in 10 charts He was sentenced to one year in a US Navy prison. FBI investigators said on Tuesday they have been trying to unlock Kelley's mobile phone, to better understand what led him to carry out the mass shooting. According to the Houston Chronicle newspaper, the 26-year-old killer had shown up at the First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs with his children for an annual fall festival five days before the shooting. A friend of Kelley's former mother-in-law Michelle Shields, who officials believe he was targeting on Sunday, said she was glad to see him at last week's event with her grandchildren following past family troubles.

In an interview with San Antonio television station KSAT,external, Rosanne Solis described the terror among congregants. Armed with an assault rifle and 450 rounds of ammunition, the gunman began shooting into the small wooden building from outside. Who was Sutherland Springs gunman? Ms Solis, who was sitting near the entrance, said he stormed through the front of the church, shouting: ""Everybody die!"" ""Everybody was saying, 'Be quiet! it's him, it's him!'"" said Ms Solis. She added: ""Everybody got down, crawling under wherever they could hide. He was shooting hard."" Witnesses said the gunman walked up and down the aisles looking for survivors to shoot. Ms Solis' husband, Joaquin Ramirez, told how he made eye contact with Annabelle Pomeroy - the 14-year-old daughter of the church's pastor. She was crying for help, Mr Ramirez told KSAT. He said he motioned with his finger for her to stay quiet. Annabelle was killed. This video can not be played 'Our kids play together,' says a resident whose neighbours are feared dead Mr Ramirez said the gunman also killed young children who were crying, shooting them at point-blank range. He and his wife survived by playing dead, though she was shot in the arm and he was hit by shrapnel. Another survivor, Farida Brown, 73, had a narrow escape, her son David Browntold KENS-TV,external. ""The shooter was making his rounds, and he ended up there and started shooting this lady multiple times,"" Mr Brown told the station.

You're going to go to heaven.' ""And then she knew it was her turn to be shot, and so she just started praying that God would take her soul to heaven."" But at that moment a neighbour, Stephen Willeford, entered the church and began shooting at Kelley. As Kelley fled in his car, Mr Willeford flagged down a passing motorist, Johnnie Langendorff. The two gave chase in Mr Langendorff's pickup truck until Kelley's vehicle crashed in a ditch. The gunman was found dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head, say police.

""They thought, 'oh this is good. This is progress,'""said the woman,external. Photos of the event on the church's Facebook page show children dressed in Halloween costumes and playing games. Several of the victims are also shown in the images. This video can not be played Johnnie Langendorff: ""I'm just a guy who wanted to do the right thing"" Survivors have been describing how Kelley went pew to pew in the church shooting crying children. In an interview with San Antonio television station KSAT,external, Rosanne Solis described the terror among congregants. Armed with an assault rifle and 450 rounds of ammunition, the gunman began shooting into the small wooden building from outside. Who was Sutherland Springs gunman? Ms Solis, who was sitting near the entrance, said he stormed through the front of the church, shouting: ""Everybody die!"" ""Everybody was saying, 'Be quiet! it's him, it's him!'"" said Ms Solis. She added: ""Everybody got down, crawling under wherever they could hide. He was shooting hard."" Witnesses said the gunman walked up and down the aisles looking for survivors to shoot. Ms Solis' husband, Joaquin Ramirez, told how he made eye contact with Annabelle Pomeroy - the 14-year-old daughter of the church's pastor. She was crying for help, Mr Ramirez told KSAT. He said he motioned with his finger for her to stay quiet. Annabelle was killed. This video can not be played 'Our kids play together,' says a resident whose neighbours are feared dead Mr Ramirez said the gunman also killed young children who were crying, shooting them at point-blank range. He and his wife survived by playing dead, though she was shot in the arm and he was hit by shrapnel. Another survivor, Farida Brown, 73, had a narrow escape, her son David Browntold KENS-TV,external. ""The shooter was making his rounds, and he ended up there and started shooting this lady multiple times,"" Mr Brown told the station. This video can not be played After the Las Vegas attack in October 2017 the BBC looked at how US mass shootings are getting worse ""And the lady looked at my mom the whole time, and my mom was looking at her and telling her, 'It's OK, you're going to go to heaven. You're going to go to heaven.' ""And then she knew it was her turn to be shot, and so she just started praying that God would take her soul to heaven."" But at that moment a neighbour, Stephen Willeford, entered the church and began shooting at Kelley. As Kelley fled in his car, Mr Willeford flagged down a passing motorist, Johnnie Langendorff. The two gave chase in Mr Langendorff's pickup truck until Kelley's vehicle crashed in a ditch. The gunman was found dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head, say police.

How the WhatsApp supermarket scam works,"Scammers have used WhatsApp to trick people into handing over personal information by tempting them with bogus supermarket vouchers. The messenger app was used to send fake vouchers to people, purporting to be from trusted chains such as Asda, Tesco and Aldi. The messages claimed to offer hundreds of pounds in savings so long as the user followed a link to an online survey asking for personal details. The scam is a form of phishing, where fraudsters pose as reputable organisations to gain personal details. Action Fraud, the UK's national reporting centre for fraud and cyber crime, suggests anyone who has fallen victim to this scamto report it online,externalor call 0300 123 2040. So far, 33 people have come forward to report falling victim to the scam, although it is unclear how many people have received the message. Fake WhatsApp fools Android users 'We lost Â£300,000 through payment scam' This message was sent to the WhatsApp number used by the public to contact the BBC The scam works by using a link which appears almost identical to a supermarket chain's legitimate website, but with one small difference. For example, in the screenshot above, the d in Aldi is actually a á¸ - a Latin character with a small dot underneath the recognisable letter. In the tweet below, the d in Asda has been replaced with Ä - another character known as a crossed D. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Attempting to visit the fake 'Alá¸i' homepage sends the user to an error page for this website Meanwhile, at time of writing, attempting to access the misspelled Asda site brings up a warning in some browsers.

BBC sees 'spike' in harassment cases,"Not all cases are thought to relate to current BBC staff The BBC has said it is dealing with a ""spike"" in complaints of sexual harassment. The deputy director general told MPs there had been a recent increase in the number of cases after the BBC encouraged staff to come forward. Anne Bulford said the corporation is currently investigating 25 individuals for alleged sexual harassment. Last year only three cases were investigated, with just one case in each of the two years before that. In a statement, the BBC said: ""Since the Harvey Weinstein revelations, we've been actively encouraging staff to come forward with any concerns. ""We hope other employers are doing the same, and when allegations are made, we have well-established processes to investigate."" Director general Tony Hall said there is a zero tolerance approach to sexual harassment Anne Bulford told the House of Commons Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee that the BBC is looking into ""25 live cases"". However, not all are thought to relate to current staff. A number of the allegations are believed to be historic, involving people who have worked for the BBC or for third parties associated with the BBC in the past. The deputy director general said: ""We have to continue to encourage people to speak. Whether they're current or whether they're historic in relation to sexual harassment, the important thing is people come forward."" Ms Bulford also confirmed that issues raised by staff working with independent production companies and third party suppliers would be supported by the BBC's confidential helpline, which was set up in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal. Director general Tony Hall commented: ""As far as harassment, bullying and... sexual harassment goes, we should have zero tolerance. That means making it as easy as possible to do the very difficult thing of coming forwards and calling out behaviour."" Asked how many staff were currently suspended pending an investigation into sexual harassment, the BBC responded: ""We can't comment on individuals but treat any allegations seriously and have processes in place for investigating them.""

Twitter to expand 280-character tweets,"Twitter plans to increase the number of characters in tweets from 140 to 280 for the majority of users. The new limit will not apply to tweets written in Japanese, Chinese and Korean which can convey more information in a single character. The move follows a trial among a small group of users which started in September in response to criticism that it was not easy enough to tweet. The change is part of Twitter's plan to attract new users and increase growth. During the test, only 5% of tweets sent were longer than 140 characters and only 2% more than 190, the social media site said ina blog post,external. But those who did use the longer tweets, got more followers, more engagement and spent more time on the site, it added. ""During the first few days of the test, many people tweeted the full 280 limit because it was new and novel, but soon after behaviour normalised,"" wrote Aliza Rosen, Twitter's product manager. ""We saw when people needed to use more than 140 characters, they tweeted more easily and more often. But importantly, people tweeted below 140 most of the time and the brevity of Twitter remained."" According to Twitter, 9% of tweets in English hit the character limits. ""This reflects the challenge of fitting a thought into a tweet, often resulting in lots of time spent editing and even at times abandoning tweets before sending,"" Ms Rosen said. Increasing the character limit should not affect people's experience on the site, she added. ""We - and many of you - were concerned that timelines may fill up with 280-character tweets, and people with the new limit would always use up the whole space. But that didn't happen."" When the change was announced, many criticised it, pointing out changes they would rather see, such as a crackdown on hate crime and bots, and the introduction of a chronological timeline and edit function. The site currently has 330 million active users. This compares with 800 million for Instagram and more than 2 billion users for Facebook.

Labour: Patel must face probe or quit,"Priti Patel must be investigated for holding unofficial meetings during a holiday in Israel or ""do the decent thing and resign"", Labour has said. The international development secretary apologised on Tuesday for holding 12 meetings, including one with Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu, on a private trip. In the Commons, Labour's Kate Osamor said it was a ""black and white case"" of the ministerial code being broken. But minister Alistair Burt said policy did not change as a result of the trip. Ms Patel was not in the Commons to face an urgent question about her actions because she is on a pre-arranged visit to Africa, a situation which Labour said was ""simply not acceptable"". The BBC understands Ms Patel suggested some of Britain's aid budget go to the Israeli army, after the visit in August. She asked her officials to see if Britain could support humanitarian operations conducted by the Israeli army in the occupied Golan Heights area. Kuenssberg: A bad day at the office for Theresa May The BBC understands the Foreign Office advised that because Britain did not officially recognise Israel's annexation of the area, it would be hard for the Department for International Development to work there. Speaking in the Commons, Foreign Office minister Alistair Burt defended Ms Patel's ""perfectly legitimate"" right to raise the matter - saying it was within the context of providing medical help for Syrian refugees who could not get assistance in their own country. But he said the idea had been rejected because ministers did not think it would be ""appropriate"". He told MPs that the Foreign Office learned of her visit on 24 August, while she was still in Israel, but after a number of key meetings had already taken place. He said Ms Patel had been ""absolutely contrite"" for ""getting the sequencing wrong"" in terms of informing officials but Mrs May accepted her apology and now regarded the matter ""as closed"". But Labour's Kate Osamor said Ms Patel's actions were covered by the existing code and demanded a probe into what she did during the trip and what action she sought upon her return. The opposition says there are ""strong grounds"" to believe Ms Patel is responsible for ""multiple breaches"" include failing to act in an open and transparent manner, not abiding by the principle of collective responsibility and not being honest about the nature and number of meetings she attended. ""It is hard to think of a more black and white case of breaking the ministerial code,"" Ms Osamor said. ""It is time the secretary of state either faces a Cabinet Office investigation or does the decent thing and just resigns"". The BBC's diplomatic correspondent James Landale said local UK diplomats in Israel probably first became aware of her visit on 24 August because that was when the opposition leader she met, Yair Lapid, first tweeted about their meeting.

The BBC revealed on Friday that Ms Patel held a number of undisclosed meetings with business and political figures, including Mr Lapid, the leader of Israel's centrist Yesh Atid party. No diplomats were present at the meetings, at which the minister was accompanied by an influential pro-Israeli Conservative peer and campaigner, Lord Polak. Ms Patel has admitted how the meetings were set up ""did not accord with the usual procedures"". Former Conservative foreign secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that it was ""extremely unwise"" for Ms Patel to have held secret meetings with Israeli officials. Ms Patel discussed Benjamin Netanyahu's visit to the UK, which took place last week ""Not only did she not tell the Foreign Office directly, so far as I'm aware the British Embassy in Israel wasn't aware that this was happening. Now that just shouldn't be done... it's not just a question of courtesy,"" he said.

Labour: Patel must face probe or quitPriti Patel faces more questions about unofficial Israeli meetings - but No 10 says matter is closed.1han hour agoUK Politics,"Priti Patel must be investigated for holding unofficial meetings during a holiday in Israel or ""do the decent thing and resign"", Labour has said. The international development secretary apologised on Tuesday for holding 12 meetings, including one with Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu, on a private trip. In the Commons, Labour's Kate Osamor said it was a ""black and white case"" of the ministerial code being broken. But minister Alistair Burt said policy did not change as a result of the trip. Ms Patel was not in the Commons to face an urgent question about her actions because she is on a pre-arranged visit to Africa, a situation which Labour said was ""simply not acceptable"". The BBC understands Ms Patel suggested some of Britain's aid budget go to the Israeli army, after the visit in August. She asked her officials to see if Britain could support humanitarian operations conducted by the Israeli army in the occupied Golan Heights area. Kuenssberg: A bad day at the office for Theresa May The BBC understands the Foreign Office advised that because Britain did not officially recognise Israel's annexation of the area, it would be hard for the Department for International Development to work there. Speaking in the Commons, Foreign Office minister Alistair Burt defended Ms Patel's ""perfectly legitimate"" right to raise the matter - saying it was within the context of providing medical help for Syrian refugees who could not get assistance in their own country. But he said the idea had been rejected because ministers did not think it would be ""appropriate"". He told MPs that the Foreign Office learned of her visit on 24 August, while she was still in Israel, but after a number of key meetings had already taken place. He said Ms Patel had been ""absolutely contrite"" for ""getting the sequencing wrong"" in terms of informing officials but Mrs May accepted her apology and now regarded the matter ""as closed"". But Labour's Kate Osamor said Ms Patel's actions were covered by the existing code and demanded a probe into what she did during the trip and what action she sought upon her return. The opposition says there are ""strong grounds"" to believe Ms Patel is responsible for ""multiple breaches"" include failing to act in an open and transparent manner, not abiding by the principle of collective responsibility and not being honest about the nature and number of meetings she attended. ""It is hard to think of a more black and white case of breaking the ministerial code,"" Ms Osamor said. ""It is time the secretary of state either faces a Cabinet Office investigation or does the decent thing and just resigns"". The BBC's diplomatic correspondent James Landale said local UK diplomats in Israel probably first became aware of her visit on 24 August because that was when the opposition leader she met, Yair Lapid, first tweeted about their meeting.

The BBC revealed on Friday that Ms Patel held a number of undisclosed meetings with business and political figures, including Mr Lapid, the leader of Israel's centrist Yesh Atid party. No diplomats were present at the meetings, at which the minister was accompanied by an influential pro-Israeli Conservative peer and campaigner, Lord Polak. Ms Patel has admitted how the meetings were set up ""did not accord with the usual procedures"". Former Conservative foreign secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that it was ""extremely unwise"" for Ms Patel to have held secret meetings with Israeli officials. Ms Patel discussed Benjamin Netanyahu's visit to the UK, which took place last week ""Not only did she not tell the Foreign Office directly, so far as I'm aware the British Embassy in Israel wasn't aware that this was happening. Now that just shouldn't be done... it's not just a question of courtesy,"" he said. Lord Ricketts, former head of the diplomatic service, told BBC Radio 4's World Tonight that he couldn't think of a precedent ""where a senior minister visits a country, has an extensive programme like this without the Foreign Office, the foreign secretary or even the ambassador in the country knowing about it"".

"'We had Â£300,000 taken in payment scam'","This video can not be played Kate Blakeley: 'We lost Â£300,000 through payment scam' People who have been conned into authorising their bank to pay a fraudster could find it easier to get compensation, under plans being put together by the regulator. The Payment Systems Regulator is trying to devise a way to reimburse victims of authorised push payment (APP) scams. In the first half of this year, 19,000 victims lost Â£100m to APP scams. One such, Kate Blakeley, described the ""sheer horror"" of discovering the loss of almost Â£300,000 through such a scam. Ms Blakeley, who was in the process of buying a house with her partner, described her experience. She thought she was transferring money to the right account, but it was in fact one controlled by a fraudster. ""Everything had gone very smoothly,"" she said. ""Our conveyancing solicitor provided details by email of the bank accounts to make the money transfers on the day of completion. ""We transferred just under Â£300,000 on the day and within about three hours, we realised the money had gone missing. ""The moment of realising the money hadn't arrived as intended with the bank account we sent it to, or thought we'd sent it to, was just sheer horror."" Ms Blakeley did get all the money back eventually, but lost thousands in solicitors' fees. The matter is still subject to a legal dispute. The PSR has been investigating APP scams following a super-complaint by consumer body Which?. The regulator said ""good progress"" was being made in a number of areas and it hoped a compensation system would be in place by September 2018. As well as starting to record and understand the scale of APP scams, the PSR will also introduce new standards for banks to follow when a victim reports such a scam, which should improve victims' experience and banks' response times. However, PSR managing director Hannah Nixon warned that not every scam could be prevented. ""There is no silver bullet for APP scams, and some people will still, unfortunately, lose out,"" she said. ""That's why we've continued to look for a solution that could reimburse those who are scammed, and today we begin consulting on an option that we think could work."" She added that account holders also needed to take ""an appropriate level of care"" in protecting themselves. When you transfer money from your bank account, you are asked to enter three pieces of information:  the name of the payee, their account number, and the sort code. However, only the last two are cross-checked by the bank. So putting in the correct name is no guarantee that person will get the money. Financial Fraud Action UK offers the following advice: Never disclose security details, such as your PIN or full banking password Don't assume an email, text or phone call is authentic Don't be rushed - a genuine organisation won't mind waiting Listen to your instincts - you know if something doesn't feel right Stay in control - don't panic and make a decision you'll regret The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has reviewed the way banks handle APP scams. It found banks' procedures were inconsistent, their existing fraud detection systems could not easily detect APP scams, and they did not collect enough data. However, the FCA considers the industry initiatives underway will help to tackle these issues. Peter Vicary-Smith, chief executive of Which?, said: ""It's good to see the regulator coming down on the side of consumers. If this stops the huge amounts of money lost to bank transfer scams, it'll be a significant win. ""To make this a reality, the regulator must now ensure any reimbursement scheme properly compensates victims. Meanwhile, banks must move to quickly put in place better checks and protections to prevent these scams happening in the first place.""

"Double-death driver, 90, spared jail","Philip Bull admitted two counts of causing death by dangerous driving A 90-year-old driver who killed a couple by reversing into them has been given a two-year suspended sentence. Philip Bull made a ""genuine but catastrophic mistake"" when he backed into Clare Haslam, 44, and Deborah Clifton, 49, outside Withington Hospital, a judge said. Manchester Crown Court heard Bull pressed the accelerator instead of the brake in his automatic car. He earlier admitted two counts of causing death by dangerous driving. Bull had been dropping his wife Audrey, 87, at the hospital in Manchester on 7 March when he hit Ms Haslam and Ms Clifton. The pair, from Chorlton-cum-Hardy, were both taken to hospital where they later died. Bull, who served in the Armed Forces, was ""hugely remorseful"", the court heard. ""I cannot think of any way worse to come to the end of my life having now ended the lives of others,"" he told the author of a report. Clare Haslam and Deborah Clifton were described as ""soulmates"" Richard Vardon, defending, had earlier argued the circumstances of the tragic case were ""exceptional"". He said Bull had cared for his wife of 65 years, who suffered from a number of conditions, including Alzheimer's disease, for more than a decade. She could not be cared for at home without her husband, Mr Vardon said. Judge Martin Walsh said he had chosen to suspend the jail term after ""careful and considered reflection"". He said this would be ""difficult to accept by some, if not all, of the family and friends of the deceased"" and ""in the light of their personal grief, such feelings may be understandable."" ""I want to make the obvious point that nothing that this court can do can put right the wrong, or restore the devastating loss that occurred. ""The sentence that this court imposes is not intended to and cannot ever reflect the value of the lives lost."" He told Bull: ""You made a genuine but catastrophic mistake. The consequences were unforeseen and completely unintended. Philip Bull was driving in the Withington Hospital car park when the crash happened The judge said an ""immediate sentence of imprisonment"" would not ""serve as a deterrent"" nor ""put right the harm that has been done"". ""The fact is that you will live for the rest of your life in the knowledge that your unintended actions on this occasion resulted in the deaths of two people. ""That is your burden to bear,"" he said. Bull was also banned from driving for life Outside court, Ms Clifton's sister Julie expressed anger at the sentence. She said: ""His defence barrister said how remorseful he was but he has never once directed that at the family. ""That's the least he could have done, was to address us and apologise but he didn't even do that. It doesn't matter how old you are, if you cause death by dangerous driving. ""He took our sister away, mother and nana away, he's taken everything away and there is still not a day goes by where we don't re-live every single moment of what happened. ""I sit there with the vision of identifying my sister. Seeing her in the chapel of rest and now going through my mind every minute of exactly what happened to her. ""We weren't considered in there, it was all about him. ""I hope he remembers this for the rest of his life and I hope he lives a very long time, I do."" Some family members gasped in the public gallery as the judge announced the sentence was to be suspended, with several leaving the courtroom. After sentencing, one woman turned to Bull's relatives and said: ""I hope your dad lives a long time to regret this. I hope he thinks about them every day."" Ms Haslam and Ms Clifton had a child and were ""blissfully happy soulmates"",their families said. Bull had no pre-existing impairment to his driving and his licence had been repeatedly renewed every three years. The defendant had no previous convictions and could properly be described as a man of hitherto impeccable character, the judge said. Bull was also banned from driving for life.

Firework arson attack victim diesA commercial firework containing 200 tubes of explosives was let off in Anthony Nicholls' home.3h3 hours agoBirmingham & Black Country,"The house in Tile Cross was gutted in the fire A man has died five days after a 200-shot commercial firework was let off inside his Birmingham home. Anthony Nicholls, 56, had been in an induced coma since the attack at 23:00 GMT on Thursday, police said. His 50-year-old wife suffered lower leg fractures when she jumped from a first-floor window of their Tile Cross home. She remains in hospital.

The island that swapped donkey rides for offshore cash," It was still dark when the private jet began its descent. Inside, its decor was sumptuous, the black leather seats piped with red, but outside rain was falling and the temperature on the ground below was a bracing 2C. The date was 21 January 2013, and the island that the plane was heading towards hadn't yet woken up. The candy-red Challenger 605 aircraft carried the registration G-LCDH - the initials of Lewis Carl Davidson Hamilton, the World Championship-winning Formula One driver. The previous month, Hamilton had flown on the jet with his then-girlfriend, the former Pussycat Dolls singer turned X Factor judge Nicole Scherzinger, and their families, to Hawaii for a Christmas holiday. The aircraft’s latest destination wasn’t so celebrated as a hang-out of the rich and famous. It wasn't Monaco or Miami Beach. It wasn’t Dubai. It wasn’t even the Channel Islands. It was the Isle of Man, the Crown Dependency between Ireland and Great Britain best known for its tail-less cats and its motorcycle race. But the plane wasn’t going to stick around for long. At 06:15 it landed. To one side of the runway were the waves of the Irish Sea. To the other was Ronaldsway Airport’s modest cream-and-blue Art Deco terminal building. Despite the early hour, someone was waiting for the jet - an Isle of Man customs official. Hamilton’s advisers had paid a £60 fee for the privilege of getting the official there early to stamp a form that showed VAT had been paid in full. In December 2012, Stealth Aviation Limited - a company of Hamilton’s in the British Virgin Islands - paid $26,817,260 for the jet. Hamilton’s social media accounts show he used it for holidays and other personal jaunts, not only business. On Instagram, he posted several photographs - including one showing his bulldogs, Roscoe and Coco, on board. He was especially proud of its distinctive colour scheme. “Every time I’m at the airport you see these really sad, old white planes, with the saddest stripe down the side,” he told US talk show host Jimmy Kimmell in 2015. “If I get a plane, I’m going to pimp it out.” According to the Sunday Times Rich List, Hamilton has a £131m fortune. Normally, companies that use planes for business reasons are entitled to a VAT refund, but private individuals are not. According to emails held by Appleby, the law firm at the centre of the Paradise Papers leak, Appleby formed a VAT-registered leasing business on the Isle of Man for Lewis Hamilton. The new company, Stealth (IOM) Limited, leased the jet from Hamilton's British Virgin Islands company, Stealth Aviation Limited, and imported it into the Isle of Man. It was then leased again to a UK jet management company that provided Hamilton with a crew and other services - and which leased it back to Lewis Hamilton and his Guernsey company, BRV Limited. Because of these “commercial” transactions, Hamilton’s advisers were able to arrange a 100% VAT refund when the plane landed at Ronaldsway. The £3.3m VAT bill was paid on Hamilton’s behalf by an Isle of Man accountancy firm. So when the aircraft landed, the customs official attending out of hours stamped a VAT-paid form to be kept on board the aircraft. This granted the aircraft “full and free circulation” in the EU. Leasing documents in the Paradise Papers show that Hamilton’s company, BRV Limited, expected to use the plane two-thirds of the time, with him signed up personally to use the other third. EU and UK VAT rules state that refunds should not be granted in relation to private use of aircraft – but Hamilton got a full refund. Hamilton wasn't alone in doing this. More than 50 others have imported planes to the Isle of Man with Appleby’s help. In total, the Isle of Man has refunded more than £790m to 231 aircraft leasing companies that have imported jets. And Paradise Papers documents suggest Lewis Hamilton is far from the only super-rich visitor to get a VAT refund on jets they used for pleasure as well as work. Lawyers acting for Lewis Hamilton say the driver has a “set of professionals in place who run most aspects of his business operations and that no subterfuge or improper levels of secrecy had been put in place"". In a statement, they say Stealth (IOM) Limited was formed to run a leasing business and hire the aircraft on a long-term basis at a commercial rate. They add that the company made all necessary disclosures to Isle of Man officials, who approved the approach. The lawyers said that reducing taxes was not the motive, but even if it had been, it is lawful to lease rather than buy in order to reduce VAT. The Isle of Man has one of the largest private aircraft registries in the world, with about 970 luxury jets officially registered since it began in 2007. In light of the Paradise Papers revelations, the Isle of Man government has invited the UK Treasury to conduct an assessment of the practice of importing aircraft into the EU through the island. It has denied ""mistakenly"" refunding VAT and says it follows the same policies, rules and regulations regarding the treatment of VAT as the UK. Once the form was stamped, Hamilton’s candy-red plane was free to take off again at 08:10. It had spent less than two hours at Ronaldsway, and didn’t even stay long enough to see the sunrise. There’s an old proverb in the Manx language inscribed on the wall of the museum at Douglas, the island’s capital:Nagh insh dou cre va mee, agh insh dou cre tamee. It means: “Don’t tell me what I was, but tell me what I am.” Spend any time on the island, however, and you realise it’s impossible to make sense of its present without grappling with its past. When Phil Craine was growing up there in the 1960s, it very much wasn’t the kind of place racing drivers' private jets dropped by. Phil Craine Instead, his memories are of the promenade in Douglas teeming with working-class holidaymakers from Liverpool, Manchester, Belfast, Glasgow and other industrial cities. He recalls a place of “donkey rides, rowing boats, Punch and Judy, people selling deckchairs and windbreaks - absolutely packed, still, in the 60s”. As a boy, Phil could name each of the eight Steam Packet vessels that brought holidaymakers to and from the Sea Terminal in Douglas. At the Manx tourism industry’s peak, some 600,000 visitors came to the island each year. In the summer months the boarding houses would fill up with tourists, and the industry was the backbone of the Manx economy. It wouldn’t stay that way for long. By the late 1960s, the arrival of the package holiday was starting to hit the island hard. For the price of a week in Douglas or Peel you could fly to Spain and guaranteed sunshine. Average summer visitor numbers were 50,000 fewer in the 60s than in the 50s. Between 1964 and 1970, the number of hotels and guesthouses on the island fell by more than a quarter. When Phil finished school in 1974, it didn’t feel as though there were many prospects for him. Like many others of his generation, he “went across” - the Manx term for travelling to Great Britain - to study and find work. But the Manx people have a habit of coming back from adversity. They had withstood invasion by the Vikings, the Scots and the English, not to mention the decline of the fishing and mining industries. Despite the influence of its larger neighbours, Manx identity remains strong. The most common accent is now a sort of cross between Scouse and Cumbrian, but the native language has undergone something of a revival. Drive around the island, and everywhere, in back gardens and by doorways and infields, you’ll see the Manx triskelion flag - three armoured legs with golden spurs on a red background. Since the 17th Century it has been accompanied by a Latin motto:Quocunque jeceris stabit.It means: “Whichever way you throw me, I shall stand.” The island was able to leverage its unusual constitutional position as a Crown Dependency. Though halfway between Liverpool and Belfast, it isn’t part of the UK or the EU, but has access to both. While the Queen is the head of state and the UK is responsible for the island’s defences, it is self-governing, and sets its own rates of tax. In 1961 the Tynwald, the island’s parliament, began cutting income taxes in order to attract incomers. In the 70s, there was an influx of merchant and commercial banks too. By 1980, the top rate of income tax was set at 20%, where it is still today, and the maximum amount payable remains capped. Currently the corporation tax rate is 0%, compared with 19% in the UK. On the Isle of Man there is no capital gains tax, inheritance tax or stamp duty. The effect of all this was an economic boom on the tiny island. Over the past 30 years, its economic growth has been three times that of the UK’s. Some critics have argued that the island's economy has become too reliant on finance. The Manx government rejects this. ""We have a fully diversified economy,"" says Howard Quayle, the chief minister. ""Our e-business sector is just as big as our financial services."" The government points to a burgeoning space industry, cheese, scallops and films – more than 100 movies and television series have been shot on Man since 1995. While he studied commerce at Liverpool University and, later, trained as an accountant in London, Phil would regularly come home to visit his family and, each time, he noticed its remarkable transformation. I was living off the island and I thought: ‘Good old Isle of Man, it’s doing really well, notching up these double-digit increases in growth.’” He didn’t think too much about where that growth was coming from. That would come later, and it set Phil on a collision course with many of his fellow islanders. In the middle of Douglas, a short walk up the hill from the marina at Douglas Harbour, there’s a thoroughfare of anonymous-looking Georgian terraces called Athol Street. The buildings all look smart, if unassuming. You could be in almost any British town. But if you look closely at the names of the firms operating here, you’ll realise this is no ordinary road. Among the companies along here are KPMG, Zurich International Life and Appleby - the firm at the centre of the Paradise Papers, a huge leak of financial documents that sheds light on how the ultra-wealthy invest their cash. This is the centre of the Isle of Man’s financial district. This island, with its population of less than 85,000, has more than 30,000 registered companies. Some 17% of the island’s income comes from banking, finance and business services and the same proportion comes from insurance. Each lunchtime, office workers in pinstripe suits emerge from Athol Street’s buildings. Many huddle together in Coffee Exchange or the Courthouse bar around a laptop or a sheaf of papers, keeping their voices low as they talk business. There’s the occasional visible indication that this is a place apart, like the sign in the window of The Thirsty Pigeon pub declaring that it accepts Bitcoin. Unlike some once-popular British seaside resorts, the town looks quietly prosperous. For the most part, the former boarding houses along the promenade in Douglas are clean and freshly painted. But for all the money that passes through the island, you don’t see the kind of conspicuous wealth you’d expect in Monaco or even Jersey. On Manx roads you’ll spot the occasional Rolls Royce or Ferrari, but a lot more Hondas and Fords. There are some good restaurants in Douglas, but none have a Michelin Star. On Strand Street, the capital’s main shopping thoroughfare, if you look hard enough you can find Lacoste, Hugo Boss, Vivienne Westwood and other designer brands on the shelves. But there are many more branches of the shops you would find on any British High Street - TK Maxx, River Island, Boots and Dorothy Perkins. In Ramsey, in the north of the island, there’s a “superyacht helicopter consultancy” with frosted-glass windows. Across the street is the Stanley pub, whose chalkboard promises games night on Wednesdays and karaoke at the weekend. A sprinkling of well-known, well-off celebrities have made their homes on the island over the years - Nigel Mansell, Sir Norman Wisdom, Jeremy Clarkson. But in the main it’s the salaries of accountants, lawyers and other facilitators of wealth who have bumped up GDP, says Craine, rather than the super-rich themselves: “We’re not so bothered if they come in person, we want them to put their wealth here.” In 2003, Craine returned to the island. He’d been away for almost three decades. After university he’d trained as an accountant with Peat Marwick (which later merged into KPMG) but quickly tired of it. Then he’d taken a job in London with Christian Aid, where his skills were useful in development work. When a post working for the charity on the Isle of Man opened up, he decided it was time to return home. But quickly he felt troubled by what he saw all around him. His charity had been campaigning against developing country elites moving their money to offshore banks. When he’d get off the plane at Ronaldsway, the first thing he’d see would be adverts for “wealth solutions” and “payroll management”. It unsettled him that the Manx model was, in his opinion, denying other countries revenues that could be spent on hospitals and schools. “I don’t deny the great material benefit that that’s brought to the island, it’s just that it carries ethical problems with it,” he says. Craine became convenor of a group called Taxwatch, whose members meet at each other’s homes to discuss concerns about the Manx financial system. Sometimes they write letters to local papers. When he’s asked how his campaigning against the island’s entire business model goes down with its wider population, Craine pauses. “It’s not well received,” he says eventually. “But it’s not going to be, is it? There’s opposition. People will sometimes say that I’m exaggerating or I haven’t got a full grasp of the facts.” He adds: “I’m never going to earn Brownie points by banging on about this.” It’s a small island. Everyone knows everyone else’s business. And when you’re trying to change things, that can be a problem. As you turn left at the east end of Athol Street and walk up a hill, you soon see a gleaming building that resembles a three-tiered wedding cake. Once it was the Bank of Mona, but after it folded in 1878 it was purchased by the Isle of Man government. Today it houses the House of Keys and the Legislative Council, the lower and upper chambers of the Tynwald, which has a disputed claim to be the world’s oldest continuous parliament. When Peter Karran decided at the age of 15 he wanted to sit on the Keys’Westminster-like green wooden benches, people told him not to be daft. A dyslexic labourer’s son, he wanted to see an end to capital punishment and birching (neither of which were abolished on the island until 1993) and improve social mobility for working-class young people like himself, a joiner by trade. Peter Karran “You could either moan in a pub bar or try and do something about it,” he says. In 1985, at the age of 24, he was elected to the House of Keys. After 31 years as an MHK - including a brief spell as a minister - he stood down in 2016. He isn’t nostalgic about the institution. “Very few members weren’t part of the club, or didn’t become part of the club,” he says, referring to what he sees as the cosy atmosphere in the Tynwald. Part of the problem, he says, is that there is no formal opposition - most candidates are elected as independents, rather than as representatives of a political party (Karran was first elected as a member of the Manx Labour Party before forming the Liberal Vannin Party in 2006). The political system has, however, been praised as good for industry. “Businesses say that government officials are accessible and regulations stable,” the Economist wrote in a 2015 profile of the island. The government makes a virtue of this predictability, even boringness, when attracting investment. “We have had the same government for 600 years and there are no surprises,” Jonathan Mills, director of e-business at the Manx department of economic development, told the German broadcaster NDR. “There is no issue around the court system, there is no issue around corruption.” For Craine, the more significant factor that keeps the Manx economic model in place is apathy. “There are many people working in the offshore industries who are working there as a clerk or indeed as a manager who need that monthly salary to pay the mortgage, to put bread and jam on the table at the end of the month for their family,” he says. “I can’t criticise him or her for doing that but the system is geared so that we are as a society knowingly facilitating tax avoidance. And that’s what troubles me.” Perched above Douglas’s promenade is an estate of grand Edwardian villas known as Little Switzerland. The name long predates the island’s finance boom, but today it feels more appropriate than ever. Drive to the western coast of the island and, against the backdrop of the Irish Sea, you’ll see the occasionaltholtan- the Manx word for an abandoned house, a reminder of the hardship and emigration that characterised so much of the island’s past. Some on the island worry those days could return. Brexit has increased uncertainty, and since the 2008 crash, there has been ever greater scrutiny of offshore finance. In that year the UK’s then-Chancellor of the Exchequer Alistair Darling accused the island of being a “tax haven sitting in the Irish Sea”. Karran, for one, says the Manx government hasn’t done enough to protect the island’s public services from the risk of future economic shocks. “Our next generation should be fiscally secure,” he says. It’s not the banks he blames but the politicians, whom he accuses of “willful neglect”. The government rejects warnings from critics who say the economy needs to diversify. The government also strongly rejects the “tax haven” label. “We're not, you know, a brass plaque in the middle of the Irish sea,” Howard Quayle, the island’s chief minister, told Panorama. “We take our international responsibilities exceedingly seriously.” Quayle also points out that the OECD rates the island “compliant” in terms of transparency standards and that when in 2015 the EU published a list of tax havens, the Isle of Man was not on it. In 2013 the then Prime Minister David Cameron said it was no longer fair to describe any Crown Dependency as a tax haven. The revelations in the Paradise Papers will focus international scrutiny on the way the Isle of Man does business. For now, those like Phil Craine who want to change dramatically the island’s attitude to finance remain in a minority. He accepts the changes he would like to see would hurt. “I don’t know what’s going to come next. But I do know I’m not happy with the current model.” Craine is hopeful that, whatever happens, the Manx economy will end up, as ever, standing on one of its three legs. But no-one can know for sure which way it will land. Built with Shorthand"
Sacked Welsh Labour minister found dead,"An ex-Welsh Labour minister who faced a party investigation into allegations about his personal conduct has taken his own life, it is understood. Carl Sargeant, 49, lost his job as cabinet secretary for communities and children last Friday. He was suspended from Labour after the first minister learned of a number of alleged incidents involving women. A family statement said they were ""devastated beyond words"" at the loss of ""the glue that bound us together"". Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the death was ""deeply shocking news"". Profile of long-serving AM's career Ex-minister 'facing number of claims' Minister removed over conduct claims Reaction to the death of Carl Sargeant Mr Sargeant, who was married and had two children, was found dead at his home in Connah's Quay, Flintshire, on Tuesday morning. He was sacked from his Welsh Government job after allegations about his behaviour were passed to First Minister Carwyn Jones' office. Mr Jones had said on Monday he felt he had no choice but to refer the matter to the party. Mr Sargeant had vowed to clear his name. The Welsh Assembly's business for Tuesday was cancelled as a mark of respect following his death, and meetings on Wednesday and Thursday will also not take place. This video can not be played Welsh Assembly members pay tribute to Carl Sargeant In a statement Mr Sargeant's family said: ""Carl was a much loved husband, father and friend. ""He wasn't simply a part of our family. He was the glue that bound us together. ""He was the most kind and caring husband, father, son and friend. We are devastated beyond words, and we know our grief will be shared by all those who knew and loved him."" Police were called to an address in Connah's Quay on Tuesday The Senedd, in the wake of the death of former Welsh Government minister Carl Sargeant, is a place in shock. I do not remember an atmosphere anything like this. There is, among some senior Labour figures, a growing sense of concern and anger at the process where the government or the Labour Party appear not to have exercised their duty of care over Mr Sargeant after he faced accusations about his behaviour. There are people who spoke to Mr Sargeant on Tuesday morning who were told that he still did not know what the allegations were. Carwyn Jones's future could be on the line here. This is a trauma that could become a political crisis unless he comes up with the answers that Labour AMs in particular want to hear. More from Vaughan Paying tribute, the first minister said: ""Carl was a friend as well as a colleague and I am shocked and deeply saddened by his death. ""He made a big contribution to Welsh public life and fought tirelessly for those he represented both as a minister and as a local assembly member."" The prime minister's spokesman said in relation to the ""sad news"" about the death of Carl Sargeant, that Theresa May's ""heart goes out to Carl Sargeant's friends and family"". Mr Corbyn said the AM was ""somebody who represented our party"" and ""worked hard to represent his communities"". The Labour leader said that all allegations must be examined and pursued but added: ""There must also be great pastoral care and support given to everybody involved in these accusations, and also that we deal with them, all parties, as quickly as possible."" Speaking through tears, former local government minister Leighton Andrews told BBC Radio Wales: ""Carl Sargeant was loved. He was loved across the political divide. He was loved by the people in his own community. ""Carl was a unique politician. He arrived in the assembly from the factory floor. He grew up and still lived in the council estate that helped shape his roots in Connah's Quay - he was still very much part of that community. ""My understanding is that Carl was still not aware of the detail of the allegations against him even though, I'm told, this morning."" This video can not be played Ex-Plaid AM Rhodri Glyn Thomas: ""Carl clearly felt he'd been found guilty"" Former Plaid Cymru AM Rhodri Glyn Thomas said Mr Sargeant ""clearly felt he had been found guilty before he had a chance to defend himself. ""So I think we need to develop a system which is fair to everybody, which defends everybody, but doesn't place people in a position where they feel they have no opportunity whatsoever to fight their cause."" Tributes were paid across the political divide on Tuesday. Conservative Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns said he was ""shocked and saddened"" by the news, adding: ""My heart goes out to his family, friends and colleagues."" Elin Jones, assembly presiding officer, said Mr Sargeant ""served the people of Alyn and Deeside with pride and determination"" and that he had made an ""enormous contribution to the development of this democratic institution"". Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies said: ""Our Parliament has lost a stalwart and many of us have lost a friend."" Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood said: ""Carl Sargeant made a significant contribution to Welsh politics, both as an assembly member and a government minister."" UKIP Wales leader Neil Hamilton described him as a ""gentle giant"" who would be ""missed across the party divide"". Liberal Democrat Kirsty Williams, who was a colleague of Mr Sargeant's in the Welsh Government, said: ""Not only was Carl a dedicated local AM, but he was an effective government minister who had a significant impact across political life at a national and community level."" FC Nomads, the Connah's Quay football team that Mr Sargeant was president of, cancelled all games this weekend in a mark of respect. North Wales Police Supt Mark Pierce said police were called at about 11:30 GMT on Tuesday to a report that a man's body had been found at an address in Connah's Quay. ""The man has been formally identified as local AM Carl Sargeant. His next of kin have been informed and police are supporting the family,"" he said.

Sturgeon makes gay convictions apology,"This video can not be played 'This was a wrong committed by the state' Nicola Sturgeon has offered an unequivocal apology to gay men convicted of sexual offences that are no longer illegal. The first minister's apology coincided withnew legislation that will automatically pardon gay and bisexual men,externalconvicted under historical laws. The bill will also allow the removal of such convictions from criminal records. Consensual homosexual acts between men aged over 21 in Scotland were only decriminalised in 1981. And it was not until 20 years later that the age of consent for gay men was lowered to 16. Speaking in the Scottish Parliament, the first minister said it was ""shocking"" that consenting sexual activity between men in Scotland was still classed as a criminal activity until so recently. She added: ""Before then, hundreds of people in Scotland were liable to be convicted as criminals, simply for loving another adult."" Brian Taylor: Sturgeon's apology greeted by tears of joy Coming Oot: A history of gay Scotland Click here for the Holyrood Live report And the first minister said the simple fact was that parliamentarians in Scotland had, over many decades, supported or at least accepted laws which ""we now recognise to have been completely unjust"". Ms Sturgeon said: ""Those laws criminalised the act of loving another adult; they deterred people from being honest about their identity to family, friends, neighbours and colleagues; and by sending a message from parliament that homosexuality was wrong, they encouraged rather than deterred homophobia and hate. ""Today as first minister I categorically, unequivocally and wholeheartedly apologise for those laws and for the hurt and the harm that they caused to so many. ""Nothing that this parliament does can erase those injustices, but I do hope this apology, alongside our new legislation, can provide some comfort to those who endured those injustices ""And I hope that it provides evidence of this parliament's determination in so far as we can to address the harm that was done."" Two men sitting in the public gallery became visibly emotional as Ms Sturgeon made her apology The apology was made on the same day as the publication of the Historical Sexual Offences (Pardons and Disregards) Bill. The legislation will give an automatic pardon to gay men convicted under historical discriminatory laws - but will not apply to behaviour that is still illegal today. It will also enable men to apply to have convictions for same-sex sexual activity that is now legal removed from central criminal conviction records. Justice Secretary Michael Matheson said the new legislation was an important step towards addressing the injustice faced by many gay men in the past. He added: ""These discriminatory laws, although abolished, continue to have implications for people to this day and it is only right that we address this historic wrong, which criminalised people simply because of who they loved."" The bill would give an automatic formal pardon to people, both living and dead, who were convicted of historical sexual offences where the conviction was for conduct which is now legal. However, the pardon is a purely symbolic acknowledgement that the laws were discriminatory, and it does not reverse the conviction. Anyone with a historical conviction for same-sex sexual activity that is now legal would have to apply for a formal ""disregard"" in order to prevent the information being included in disclosure checks. It would then be up to Scottish ministers to decide, based on the available evidence about the specific case, whether the disregard is granted. A successful disregard application means the conviction will not appear on any background check carried out by Disclosure Scotland, and the person will be treated as not having committed the offence. Derek Ogg, a QC who has campaigned for gay rights for decades, told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme that it was a ""wonderful day"". He added: ""It's Scotland at peace with itself and it is a reconciliation between the people in Scotland who are alive and the families of gay people who are dead, who were prosecuted, convicted, simply because of the gender of the person they loved or fancied. ""You can't underestimate the scars that leaves on people. I've never been convicted of such an offence but the fact is that the law was there and could have been used, I could have been arrested. ""I was at the very beginning of my legal career - my career would have been destroyed. An apology, together with the pardons bill, is appropriate."" As Labour's Kezia Dugdale noted, apologies are rare events in politics and customarily have to be wrung from an unwilling government by the persistence of opposition parties. This, as she also generously noted, was of a very different character. It was a sincere apology from the FM, delivered with power and empathy. Furthermore, Nicola Sturgeon was apologising on behalf of a much wider constituency. By definition, she was not apologising for personal or political failings. Her government had nothing to do with historic laws banning gay sex. Indeed, through such initiatives as gay marriage, their actions have been decidedly in the liberal direction. But Ms Sturgeon explained that she felt the apology was a proper accompaniment to the bill proposing an automatic pardon with a concomitant right to obtain the disregard of convictions in record books. His views were echoed by former Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale, who praised Ms Sturgeon for making the apology on behalf of previous governments. Ms Dugdale told the Holyrood chamber: ""This matters because it effects men who are alive today. But it also matters to those who are no longer here. ""We can not risk complacency, and upholding anti-discriminatory laws is critical. Today is a landmark day in Scotland's LGBT history."" Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson added her ""unequivocal and wholehearted"" apology to that of the first minister. Ms Davidson said: ""My hope for those men and their families is that they now feel a weight lifted and that as well as criminal records formally being wiped clean, any lingering sense of legal stigma, any last shadow of unfair disgrace, is firmly banished."" And Scottish Greens co-convener Patrick harvie said he came out as a teenager when the age of consent was still 21. Gay and bisexual men convicted of now-abolished sexual offences in England and Wales received posthumous pardons in January, with thousands of living men convicted over consensual same-sex relationships also eligible for the pardon. It followed the pardoning of World War Two code-breaker Alan Turing for gross indecency in 2013. Private homosexual acts between men aged over 21 were decriminalised in England and Wales in 1967.

Shopping centre taxes avoided,"The St Enoch Centre is a large mall in the centre of Glasgow Private equity firm Blackstone avoided tens of millions of pounds in UK taxes on property deals in Glasgow and London, the Paradise Papers show. The documents reveal it used offshore companies to purchase and operate the St Enoch Shopping Centre in Glasgow and Chiswick Business Park in London. The papers show how accountancy firms mapped out strategies to minimise or avoid every significant tax. Blackstone said its investments were ""wholly compliant with UK tax laws"". Follow all the latest updates Blackstone avoided UK taxes on St Enoch Centre Celtic shareholder Dermot Desmond's private jet firm used tax haven Apple's secret tax bolthole revealed Mrs Brown's Boys stars 'put money offshore' Blackstone is one of the world's biggest private equity groups and its founder and chief executive Stephen Schwarzman is a close confidant of President Trump. Leaked documents from the offshore law firm Appleby, seen by BBC Scotland, show for the first time how the group structured two major UK property deals. Top accountancy firms issued long documents to Blackstone outlining how it could use trusts in the tax haven of Jersey and a complex structure of companies in Luxembourg for the purchase of both Chiswick Park and the St Enoch Centre. Blackstone's Stephen Schwarzman is a close confidant of President Trump There is no suggestion that the plans were illegal but campaigners the Tax Justice Network described the structures Blackstone used as an ""economic fiction"". They told the BBC it was clear from the data in the papers that the principal purpose of the structures, which are virtually identical, was to avoid tax. The leaked documents show the tax structure was designed to ""minimise"" taxes US tax expert Reuven Avi-Yonah, from the University of Michigan law school, said the documents gave a ""rare"" insight into company structures that even tax authorities did not often see. ""If HMRC becomes aware of the fact that this is a common type of structuring then they are more likely to challenge it because they will be aware they are losing a lot of revenue,"" he said. Chiswick Business Park in west London is host to dozens of companies Blackstone purchased Chiswick Park, a 33-acre office development in west London, in 2011 for Â£480m. The majority of the site, which hosts the UK headquarters of companies such as Pokemon, Avon and shopping channel QVC, was sold to the Chinese government for Â£780m in 2014. The data suggests Blackstone's tax structures allowed it to avoid about Â£19m in stamp duty on the purchase. The tax structure also meant it could avoid tax of up to Â£30m annual rental income and capital gains tax on the sale of the business park, which could have been tens of millions of pounds. Blackstone still owns the St Enoch Centre In 2013, the private equity giant also bought the St Enoch Centre in Glasgow, a large city centre shopping complex housing almost 100 stores, for about Â£190m. Documents show it would have avoided stamp duty of Â£7.6m and corporate tax on up to Â£10m annual rental income. The documents show the Jersey trusts allowed no Stamp Duty Land Tax (SDLT) to be paid on St Enoch Both the St Enoch Centre, which Blackstone still owns, and Chiswick Park were already held in property trusts known as JPUTs, in the tax haven of Jersey, when it bought them. This allowed the firm to purchase the properties without paying millions of pounds in UK stamp duty. George Turner, from the Tax Justice Network, told the BBC: ""What they are doing is buying into the trust so when the original owners sold the property to Blackstone, then they weren't selling the property itself. ""They were selling an interest in the trust that owns the property and because that trust is owned offshore, they can avoid stamp duty."" Paradise Papers: All you need to know Under the tax structure revealed in the leaked documents, the Jersey trusts were owned and funded by a series of companies that Blackstone registered in Luxembourg. Money for the purchase of the properties was filtered through the Luxembourg companies from central Blackstone funds in the form of inter-company loans. The interest payments on these loans, which were effectively passed from one Blackstone company to another, could be written off against the profits of the rental income, meaning that minimal tax was paid in Luxembourg. In the case of Chiswick Park, a 33-page document was provided by accountancy firm PwC outlining the structure to be used. Another of the ""Big Four"" accountancy firms, Deloitte, issued a 67-page document for a similar tax structure for the St Enoch Centre. The job of law firm Appleby, who held the documents seen by the BBC, was to implement the structures outlined by the accountants. The central purpose of which was to avoid: Stamp Duty - by holding the property in an offshore trust in Jersey, and maintain them as collective investment schemes Income Tax - on the rental income, by funding the acquisition through a series of inter-company loans and Profit Participating Loans (PPLs), the interest payments on which can be used to write off against profits Capital Gains Tax - on disposal, thanks again to the Jersey trust George Turner, from the Tax Justice Network, said: ""The language really is quite shocking in places because it's so clear and blatant what the intention is. ""What you have here is a whole myriad of companies being set up, mostly in Luxembourg but also you have this trust structure in Jersey, and it seems to be to all intents and purposes an economic fiction."" Profit from rental income at the St Enoch Centre had normally been about Â£10m a year. The structure advised by Deloitte allowed Blackstone to turn that into tax free income, by writing it off against interest charges generated from the loans its companies had made to each other. In some years, just a few thousand pounds appears to have been paid by the Blackstone Luxembourg companies owning St Enoch and Chiswick. Mr Turner said: ""What appears to be happening is that the rental income which is coming in, the companies receiving that are then borrowing huge amounts of money from other companies which are part of the Blackstone Group. ""Now when they borrow that money, they need to pay interest on it and those interest payments destroy any profitability in those companies. ""They're borrowing money from themselves and they can claim a tax deduction on that."" Blackstone said: ""Blackstone's investments are wholly compliant with UK and international tax laws and regulations. ""The property investment structures in question were acquired from institutional investors and are of a type commonly used for decades for investments in UK real estates, including by listed companies and a variety of institutional investors, and were adopted after appropriate advice was taken from leading tax and legal advisors."" Deloitte, which advised on the St Enoch purchase, declined to comment. PwC, who advised on Chiswick Park, said ""The advice we provide is given in accordance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations, including proper disclosure to tax authorities.""

Saudis accuse Iran of 'direct aggression',"This video can not be played A Yemeni TV station released footage of what it claimed was a Riyadh-bound missile Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has accused Iran of an act of ""direct military aggression"" by supplying missiles to rebels in Yemen. This ""may be considered an act of war"", state media quoted the prince as telling UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson in a telephone conversation. On Saturday, a ballistic missile was intercepted near the Saudi capital. Iran denies arming the Houthi movement, which has fought a Saudi-led coalition backing Yemen's government since 2015. Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said the prince's claim was ""dangerous"". Riyadh's night of long knives and long-range missiles Witnessing Yemen's desperate suffering Yemen conflict: Who is fighting whom? Houthi-aligned media reported that the rebels had fired a Burkan H2 ballistic missile,externalat King Khaled International Airport, which is 850km (530 miles) from the Yemeni border and 11km north-east of Riyadh. Saudi missile defences intercepted the missile in flight, but some fragments fell inside the airport area. Human Rights Watch said the launch of an indiscriminate missile at a predominantly civilian airportwas an apparent war crime,external. The Houthi movement unveiled the Burkan 2 missile in February 2017 The official Saudi Press Agency reported on Tuesday that in his telephone call with Prince Mohammed,Mr Johnson had ""expressed his condemnation of launching a ballistic missile by Houthi coup militias"",external. ""For his part, the crown prince stressed that the involvement of the Iranian regime in supplying its Houthi militias with missiles is considered a direct military aggression by the Iranian regime and may be considered an act of war against the kingdom,"" it added. Mr Zarif condemned Saudi Arabia's ""provocative actions"" in a telephone call with Mr Johnson later on Tuesday, foreign ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi said. ""He dismissed false and dangerous claims made by Saudi officials, and said they are against international law and the UN Charter,"" Mr Qassemi added. By Jonathan Marcus, BBC diplomatic correspondent Iran and Saudi Arabia are engaged in a regional ""Cold War""; a battle for influence and power. And just like the US-Soviet Cold War, while the two main protagonists are not directly involved in fighting each other, they or their proxies are engaged on a number of other battlefields. The Saudis went into Yemen to counter alleged Iranian influence, but the campaign has proved a quagmire for the Saudi forces. Iran is in the ascendant in Iraq, where it is a close ally of the Shia-dominated government. And it is ""winning"" in Syria too, helping to stabilise and consolidate the Assad regime. Saudi support for Syrian rebel factions has achieved nothing. Now the Saudis seem to be focusing on another country where Iran's allies - in this case, Hezbollah - are well entrenched - Lebanon. But tinkering with that country's fragile stability has huge risks - not least the danger of prompting a crisis that could lead to a full-scale war between Israel and Hezbollah. On Monday, Saudi Foreign MinisterAdel al-Jubeir told CNN that members of Lebanon's Hezbollah movement, an Iranian proxy, launched the missile.,external He said the missile was similar to one launched in July that was shot down close to the Saudi city of Mecca, and that it was manufactured in Iran, disassembled and smuggled into Yemen, then reassembled by ""operatives from the Iranian Revolutionary Guards and Hezbollah"". The US permanent representative to the UN,Nikki Haley, said the missile fired in July was an ""Iranian Qaim"",external, which she described as a ""type of weapon that had not been present in Yemen before the conflict"". The missile shot down on Saturday ""may also be of Iranian origin"", she added. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Ms Haley warned that by providing such weapons to the Houthis, the Revolutionary Guards were violating two UN Security Council resolutions. Iran's foreign ministry has said the missile launch was ""an independent action"" by the Houthis in response to Saudi-led coalition ""aggression"". In response to the attack, the coalition announced the ""temporary"" closure of all Yemeni land, sea and air ports,external, tightening an existing blockade, but said humanitarian aid could continue to enter Yemen under strict vetting procedures. Houthi-aligned media reported that the rebels had fired the ballistic missile The United Nations said on Tuesday that all humanitarian flights to Yemen had been grounded and called on the coalition to re-open Yemen's borders. ""The situation is catastrophic in Yemen,"" Jens Laerke, a spokesman for the Office for the Co-ordination for Humanitarian Affairs, told reporters. More than 8,670 people - 60% of them civilians - have been killed,externaland 49,960 injured in air strikes and fighting on the ground since the coalition intervened in Yemen's civil war in March 2015, according to the UN. The conflict has also left 20.7 million people in need of humanitarian assistance, created the world's largest food security emergency, and led to a cholera outbreak that is believed to have affected 902,000 people and caused 2,191 deaths.

Tycoon made $41m from âpeopleâs fundâA fund set up to help a struggling African state has paid tens of millions in fees to a businessman.6m7 minutes agoAfrica,"An entrepreneur charged with managing the oil wealth of the struggling African state of Angola was paid more than $41m in just 20 months, leaked documents reveal. The payments were made via a complex web of companies set up in the offshore jurisdiction of Mauritius. Jean-Claude Bastos also used his position to help set up large investment deals he stands to further profit from, theParadise Papersshow. All sides deny any wrongdoing. Like many oil rich countries, Angola set up a sovereign wealth fund to invest the proceeds of its natural resource wealth. Similar schemes have been used by other countries to help ensure a steady income for future generations. Angola is wracked by corruption, suffers extreme poverty and has one of the highest child mortality rates in the world. The fund, Fundo Soberano De Angola (FSDEA), which began with $5bn (Â£3.75bn) in 2011, was mired in controversy from the start, after the then Angolan President Eduardo dos Santos' son, 39-year-old Jose Filomeno, was appointed to head it up. Jean-Claude Bastos, sometimes also known as Jean-Claude Bastos de Morais, a Swiss-Angolan and close friend of the then president's son, was chosen as the fund's asset manager. Typically, a fund of this size would spread the risk of investment among several asset managers, along with the fees it pays, said one expert. Follow all the latest updates Apple's secret tax bolthole revealed Lewis Hamilton 'dodged' VAT on jet Questions over African mining deal However, Mr Bastos was given responsibility for investing almost all of the fund's money, and was paid accordingly. Today, his company Quantum Global Investments Africa Management, manages about 85% of it. One expert described the situation as ""unusual"". Andrew Bauer, an authority on sovereign wealth funds, told the BBC: ""Funds want to hedge the risk. You don't want to put all your eggs in one basket."" In a statement, the FSDEA told the BBC the appointment of Mr Bastos' company to manage the fund followed ""an objective process"". The firm was selected, it said, because of its ""exemplary performance on previous mandates with the Angolan authorities"". The fund also said giving near total control of investments to one asset manager was part of its policy for the first 18 months only. Documents seen by the BBC as part of the Paradise Papers investigation show the fund paid management fees of more than $90m (Â£67.5m) to Mr Bastos' Mauritius-based QG Investments Africa Management. This occurred over a 20-month period between May 2014 and the end of 2015. The leak offers an unprecedented view into what happened to the management fees after being paid into Mr Bastos' company. This money was split into two main chunks - with $41m declared as dividends, or pure profit, and deposited in a company in the British Virgin Islands, itself owned by a series of secretive offshore companies ultimately owned by Mr Bastos. A further $34m was paid in advisory fees to a Swiss firm majority owned by Mr Bastos. The rest, after minor expenses, was retained in the management company run by Mr Bastos. The BBC asked Mr Bastos whether secrecy was the reason for the series of companies registered offshore. He said it was entirely his personal choice how he receives dividends from his companies. He also said the dividends he receives ""pale in comparison to the long term positive impact my projects will have in Angola"". Both the fund and Mr Bastos said the management fees paid to Quantum Global Investments Africa Management are in line with global industry standards. Mr Bastos added that the level of work provided by the group is considerable to ensure projects are built for future success. Within months of receiving the money, a company in which Mr Bastos is a director purchased a 14-seater jet that had been priced at $31.75m. Mr Bastos told the BBC his is one of ""many businesses that own an aircraft to more efficiently manage their travel requirements"" and that travelling on commercial flights is ""unproductive"". The leaked documents also show Mr Bastos holds a personal stake in investments the fund made on his recommendation. In one, tens of millions were committed to a deal with another of Mr Bastos' companies, Afrique Imo Corporation, to build a hotel, office and a retail complex in the Angolan capital, Luanda. The deal represents a ""very strong conflict of interest"" according to Mr Bauer. ""This absolutely should not be happening."" At the time, it sounded alarm bells in the compliance department of Appleby - the law firm that handled the investment, according to internal emails seen by the BBC. In one, sent from a regional compliance manager, a team member charged with making sure the deal was above board noted: ""this poses issues of conflict of interest between the Manager, Fund and the Investee Company"". However, an email from Appleby's director back to the compliance team notes Mr Bastos had ""disclosed his interest"" and, in a board meeting convened to agree the hotel deal, had ""abstained from voting"". Crucially, though, the director notes Mr Bastos ""was still present in the meeting"", before adding: ""For the purpose of managing the conflict, Mr Bastos should refrain from attending any meeting."" On seeing the confidential emails of the exchange, Tom Keatinge, a specialist in financial crime, told the BBC he was ""sure they are going to come to a conclusion that this is not a transaction that they should be approving"". Appleby ""provide[d] the client with the answer that he wanted"", said Mr Keatinge. ""It's hard to believe that just because he abstained from the voting, his views were not well understood by the meeting. So it's a scurrilous approach in my view."" As well as the Luanda complex, two other investments made for the fund in that period carried similar apparent conflicts of interest for Mr Bastos, according to the Appleby documents. Mr Bastos told the BBC that where he holds a stake in investments, he views these investments as ""having aligned interests"" and not being ""conflicted"". The FSDEA said its investment policy for the first 18 months encourages ""close interrelation and synergies... to increase the speed of portfolio development and boost institutional reach"". There are also questions about whether the hotel project represented a good investment for the fund. A former employee of Quantum Global with a direct knowledge of the Luanda deal said in 2016 the project was assessed as ""economically unviable"" because it would not bring good enough returns for the fund. The investment advisers' recommendation was to drop it. Mr Bastos insisted the investment was viable and said that ""by developing what will become Angola's tallest building his group are demonstrating their belief in the long term potential of the Angolan economy"". In Luanda in 2016, rubbish went uncollected after the refuse company was not paid The web of companies run by Mr Bastos would appear to be designed to ""to enrich a particular individual or... group of people"", said Mr Keatinge. ""Whoever has oversight of this structure... the political elite within Angola, there is either massive incompetence or there is complicity here."" Appleby, which is the focus of much of the Paradise Papers investigation, didn't respond to specific questions about Mr Bastos -  citing client confidentiality. The firm which denies any wrongdoing says it ""advises clients on legitimate and lawful ways to conduct their business"". Another document seen by the BBC raises questions for the authorities in Mauritius, after an internal report by another offshore regulator criticised Mr Bastos. The regulator in Jersey notified Mr Bastos that his application to run the asset management business was likely to be refused because it doubted his independence. It highlighted Mr Bastos' ""close association"" with the fund's chairman, Jose Filomeno Dos Santos, and a conviction in Switzerland for ""qualified cases of misappropriation"". Mr Bastos told the BBC he withdrew the application before any formal decision was made by the Jersey regulator. A little more than a month later Mr Bastos applied successfully in Mauritius. He told the BBC he informed the Mauritian authorities about his conviction which in any case had expired and that his ""criminal record is completely clean"". The BBC asked the Financial Services Commission in Mauritius how it satisfied itself Mr Bastos was a fit and proper person to be licensed. It declined to comment on the case but said where there were ""adverse"" issues disclosed in an application, the handling law firm - in this case Appleby - would be responsible for checking. Again, Appleby declined to comment on individual cases. Additional reporting by Christian Bronnimann Listen to more on this story onFile on 4,on Tuesday 7th November at 20:00 GMT on BBC Radio 4.

"'UK wellbeing rises after Brexit vote'There have been small but significant improvements in people's happiness in the last year, say UK officials.6h6 hours agoHealthComments","In the year after the UK narrowly voted to exit the European Union, there was a small but significant increase in the population's feeling of wellbeing, official statistics show. The improvements in areas such as life satisfaction and happiness were seen only in England, however. Elsewhere, the rates flatlined. People in Northern Ireland continued to report the highest levels of wellbeing. Rates of anxiety increased slightly, but not significantly. To obtain the Office for National Statistics data,external, more than 100,000 adult UK residents were asked to answer the following questions, on a scale of nought to 10, with nought being ""not at all"" and 10 being ""completely"": Overall, how satisfied are you with your life nowadays? Overall, to what extent do you feel the things you do in your life are worthwhile? Overall, how happy did you feel yesterday? Overall, how anxious did you feel yesterday? A higher proportion of people reported very high levels of life satisfaction, happiness and feelings that life was worthwhile in the year ending June 2017 compared with the previous year. The average ratings at the end of June 2017 were: 7.7 out of 10 for life satisfaction 7.9 out of 10 for feeling worthwhile 7.5 out of 10 for happiness 2.9 out of 10 for anxiety The ONS statistical bulletin suggests possible social and economic factors that might help explain the results. ""Employment and job satisfaction, our health, the quality of our relationships and our financial situation are just some of the aspects of our lives shown to have an effect,"" it says. For example, the employment rate is at its highest level since comparable records began in 1971 and the unemployment rate is at its joint lowest since 1975. There have also been improvements is gross domestic product per head and net national disposable income per head. But the ONS points out that real household disposable income per head has fallen for the fourth quarter in a row. Over the year the data covers there have been ""various situations of uncertainty"", says the ONS - a new prime minister, a vote to leave the EU and several terror attacks. ""Considering this, it may be surprising that levels of personal wellbeing are increasing. However, it is important to note these figures are only reported at a country and national level, and are presented over the year. It is therefore possible that any sudden or individual change in personal wellbeing may not be seen in the data,"" it says.

"SSE and Npower in energy merger talksA merger would bring together two of the UK's ""big six"" gas and electricity suppliers.2h2 hours agoBusiness","Energy supplier SSE says it has been in talks with the owner of rival Npower with a view to forming a new UK energy company. SSE said had been in discussions with Germany's Innogy about merging their UK gas and electricity supply businesses into an independent company. Such a merger would bring together two of the UK's ""big six"" gas and electricity suppliers. SSE, the UK's second-largest supplier, said,externalthe talks were ""well-advanced"". SSE, formerly known as Scottish and Southern Energy, supplies energy to 7.77 million households while Npower serves 4.8 million. Any merger - if allowed - would see the new company nipping at the heels of the market leader British Gas, which currently has 27% of the gas and electricity supply market, according to energy consultancy Cornwall Insight. Analysis: BBC personal finance correspondent Simon Gompertz It's well known that Npower has been struggling to make money. And that its German parent, Innogy, is looking for a way to offload the business. Like all the major suppliers, Npower and SSE face growing competition, with hundreds of thousands of people switching suppliers each month. Plus they now have the prospect of the government capping their most important prices, their standard variable tariffs. Combining the two would mean they could cut costs, so there's a danger of job losses. However it's highly likely that the competition watchdog, the CMA, would want to check the deal before letting it through. Together they would have 22% of gas and electricity customers. Add in British Gas and the two biggest suppliers would have nearly half the market. Even so shares in SSE rose by nearly 3%. A combined SSE-Npower company would have a market share of 22.5%, with Germany's E.On trailing on 12%. The other members of the ""big six"" UK suppliers are Scottish Power - which is owned by Spain's Iberdrola - and France's EDF. The merger talks take place against an intensifying debate about how well the big six companies are serving UK customers. Despite years of competition, many households do not switch supplier freely, leaving a large chunk on the most expensive Standard Variable Tariffs (SVTs). About 12 million households are on some form of default tariff, which can cost hundreds of pounds a year more than the cheapest deals. Last month,the government published draft legislationthat would give energy regulator Ofgem the power to cap SVTs. Business Secretary Greg Clark has said Ofgem should use its powers to impose a wider cap on energy bills more quickly. But the watchdog has warned it could be sued by gas and electricity firms if it capped SVTs without the backing of new legislation. Set against this, the established providers are losing market share to a growing band of small suppliers, with even local councils starting to sell their own energy packages. Neil Wilson, analyst at ETX Capital, said: ""The problem - and arguably the rationale - is that the big six are losing customers at a record pace to smaller suppliers. Smaller suppliers now account for more than 8% of market share, up from 1% just three years ago, according to Ofgem data."" Any merger deal between SSE and Innogy's Npower would need approval from competition authorities and shareholders. In a statement, SSE said: ""In discussions, SSE is mindful of the requirements of customers and the concerns of employees.  It will disclose the outcome of the discussions as soon as they are concluded."" Innogy confirmed the two were in ""advanced exclusive discussions"". SSE shares were 3% higher on news of the talks.

'UK wellbeing rises after Brexit vote',"In the year after the UK narrowly voted to exit the European Union, there was a small but significant increase in the population's feeling of wellbeing, official statistics show. The improvements in areas such as life satisfaction and happiness were seen only in England, however. Elsewhere, the rates flatlined. People in Northern Ireland continued to report the highest levels of wellbeing. Rates of anxiety increased slightly, but not significantly. To obtain the Office for National Statistics data,external, more than 100,000 adult UK residents were asked to answer the following questions, on a scale of nought to 10, with nought being ""not at all"" and 10 being ""completely"": Overall, how satisfied are you with your life nowadays?

Census 'could use mobile phone data',"Mobile phone data could be used in place of census questions in the future, a report from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) suggests. The information would allow the ONS to track where people live and work. The ONS tested the idea as part of a government-backed project looking at other data sources for the census. The report said it used commuter flow data from Vodafone users,external, collected over four weeks in March and April 2016, in three London boroughs. Users can opt out of having their data processed through their network, the report said. The UK census, which happens every 10 years, is a count of all people and households. The census is carried out by the ONS in England and Wales. Elsewhere, it is carried out by the National Records of Scotland and the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency. The ONS said it was ""early research"" and said that any intention to use data within the future production of official statistics ""will involve extensive evaluation including privacy impacts"". No personally-identifiable data was provided to the ONS, it said. Is your smartphone listening to you? Commuter flows starting or ending in the south London boroughs of Southwark, Croydon and Lambeth were analysed and compared to data from the last census in 2011. An individual's home location was based on where the phone was located during the night or when switched on in the morning, while a work location was set to where a phone was found between standard working hours, Monday to Friday. The report concluded that the two sets of data had ""good correlation"" and it suggested further research. It said it was hard to detect home workers or commuters who travel very short distances and it could mistake other groups of people for workers. For example, students or people who visit a nearby shopping area twice a week. The next census is in 2021. Is your smartphone listening to you?

Firework arson attack victim dies,"The house in Tile Cross was gutted in the fire A man has died five days after a 200-shot commercial firework was let off inside his Birmingham home. Anthony Nicholls, 56, had been in an induced coma since the attack at 23:00 GMT on Thursday, police said. His 50-year-old wife suffered lower leg fractures when she jumped from a first-floor window of their Tile Cross home. She remains in hospital. Detectives said Mr Nicholls' death ""means that we are now treating this as a murder inquiry"". Police said a large ""commercial-sized firework"" was placed in the house on Birchtrees Drive and set alight. It is thought to have contained 200 tubes of explosives and would have taken about two minutes to fully discharge. Police said a large ""commercial-sized firework"" was placed in the property and set alight Det Insp Paul Joyce said: ""The impact would have been terrifying for the occupants and I would urge anyone who sold or is missing a firework of this size to get in touch. ""This would have been a large heavy firework that would have been difficult to carry some distance, so I would ask anyone who saw someone carrying a large box in the area last Thursday night to contact us.""

"Syria 'to join Paris accord', isolating US","Syria's decision was reported at the Bonn climate conference The US is set to become isolated in its stance on the Paris climate agreement, after Syria said it was preparing to join the deal. The Paris deal unites the world's nations in tackling climate change. Syria and Nicaragua were the only nations outside the deal when it was agreed in 2015. Nicaragua signed in October. In June the US said it would withdraw, but the rules of the agreement state that this cannot be done until 2020. Meanwhile, French officials said US President Donald Trump had not been invited to December's climate summit in Paris. More than 100 countries have been invited to the summit, which is aimed at ""building coalitions"" with finance and business to further the accord, an aide to French President Emmanuel Macron said. What is climate change? Paris climate deal: US denies it will stay in accord US notifies UN of Paris climate deal pullout White House downplays US climate report ""I would like to affirm the Syrian Arab Republic's commitment to the Paris climate change accord,"" Syrian Deputy Environment Minister Wadah Katmawi told delegates of the 196 nations participating in the current climate talks in Bonn, Germany. He said the accord would be signed ""as soon as possible"", adding that Syria would seek foreign aid to help it meet its commitments under the deal. UN spokesman Nick Nuttall, quoted by AFP news agency, confirmed the move, saying that Syria would first have to submit ratification documents at the UN headquarters in New York. Correspondents say Syria was effectively an international pariah when the accord was first signed, and sanctions would have made it difficult for officials to attend the discussions in Paris. Also, the meetings coincided with some of the fiercest fighting in Syria's civil war, meaning the country was in no position to sign. This video can not be played Matt McGrath explains why we should care about climate change Announcing the US decision in June, Mr Trump said it was part of his ""solemn duty to protect America"" and he would seek a new deal that would not disadvantage US businesses. He claimed that the accord would cost the US 6.5 million jobs and $3tn (Â£2.2tn) in lost GDP - while rival economies like China and India were treated more favourably. A US statement issued in October when Nicaragua signed the agreement said the US would withdraw ""unless we can re-enter on terms that are more favourable for our country"". White House spokeswoman Kelly Love said there had been no change in Washington's position since then. Responding to the Syrian move, environmental NGO the Sierra Club issued a statement attacking the US position: ""As if it wasn't already crystal clear, every single other country in the world is moving forward together to tackle the climate crisis, while Donald Trump has isolated the United States on the world stage in an embarrassing and dangerous position."" Scientists dispute Trump climate data Does Trump still think climate change is a hoax? What is in the Paris climate agreement? Scientists point out that work to implement the Paris accord must be stepped up if it is to have any chance of success. Historically, the US, Europe and China account for almost half of the world's carbon emissions. Keep global temperature rises ""well below"" the level of 2C (3.6F) and ""endeavour to limit"" them even more, to 1.5C Limit the amount of greenhouse gases emitted by human activity to the same levels that trees, soil and oceans can absorb naturally, beginning at some point between 2050 and 2100 Review each country's contribution to cutting emissions every five years so they scale up to the challenge Enable rich countries to help poorer nations by providing ""climate finance"" to adapt to climate change and switch to renewable energy US and Syria left alone on climate accord Anger over 'untrue' climate claims US notifies UN of climate deal pullout Why does keeping global warming to 1.5C matter?

"Air Force 'failed' to flag Texas gunmanThe gunman's past criminal conviction was not entered into the US database, officials believe.11h11 hours agoUS & Canada","Kelley is believed to have been in a family row with his ex-wife and in-laws, police say The US Air Force has said it is investigating its apparent failure to enter information about Texas gunman Devin Patrick Kelley's criminal history into the national database. Ex-airman Kelley was court-martialled for domestic violence in 2012, and was barred from owning or buying guns. But last year he was able to purchase a rifle he used in Sunday's attack on a small church outside San Antonio. He killed 26 people and fled the scene. He was later found dead in his car. Police said he died from what appeared to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound after being chased by armed bystanders. Kelley was also shot in his leg and torso by a citizen, the regional director for the Texas Department of Public Safety, Freeman Martin, was quoted as saying by the Associated Press. The small town where everyone knows a victim Why are US mass shootings getting more deadly? In a statement, the Air Force said: ""Initial information indicates that [Devin] Kelley's domestic violence offense was not entered into the National Criminal Information Center database by the Holloman Air Force Base Office of Special Investigations."" This video can not be played How the Texas church mass shooting unfolded It said it was now - together with the Department of Defense - investigating the handling of Kelley's criminal records. Texas Governor Greg Abbott earlier said Kelley, 26, should not legally have been allowed to own a firearm, after having been denied a gun owner's permit by the state. Kelley bought the rifle from the Academy Sports + Outdoors shop in San Antonio. The store issued a statement sending ""deep condolences"" to the victims' families. Kelley was armed with the semi-automatic rifle and two pistols when he attacked the First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs during Sunday services. He had argued with his mother-in-law before the rampage, officials said. Kelley called his father after he was shot by an armed bystander and said he did not think he would survive. This video can not be played 'Our kids play together,' says a resident whose neighbours are feared dead ""This was not racially motivated, it wasn't over religious beliefs,"" said Mr Martin. ""There was a domestic situation going on with the family and in-laws,"" he said, adding that Kelley had sent threatening texts to his mother-in-law. ""We know that he expressed anger towards his mother-in-law, who attends this church,"" Mr Martin added. Twenty-six crosses were put in a field in Sutherland Spring - one cross for each of the victims On Monday evening, a vigil was held in Sutherland Springs. In one corner of the field, music played, people prayed, and hundreds of people held their hands in the air, the BBC's Owen Amos reports. In another, a floodlight illuminated 26 crosses - one for each person shot dead. Johnnie Langendorff (second right) and another man chased the shooter out of town Standing at the back, a feather in his cowboy hat, was Johnnie Langendorff - one of two men who chased the shooter out of town. People queued to shake Mr Langendorff's hand. At one point, a couple embraced him, and they stood in prayer for two or three minutes, our correspondent says. Wilson County Sheriff Joe Tackitt said between 12 and 14 children were among those killed in the attack in Sutherland Springs, a small town 30 miles (50km) south-east of the city of San Antonio. The youngest of those who died was only a year old. This video can not be played 'Belle died with her church family,' her mother said As many as eight members of the Holcombe family were killed in the shooting,the Washington Post reported,external. The BBC spoke to the Holcombes' neighbour Pauline Garza, who said the family did not come back from church. Sutherland Springs: The victims America's gun culture in 10 charts The First Baptist Church's pastor, Frank Pomeroy, told US media his 14-year-old daughter, Annabelle, was among those killed. Twenty people were also wounded. Kelley was court-martialled in 2012 after he was accused of assault against his wife and step-son. He was sentenced to 12 months' confinement. He received a ""bad conduct"" discharge two years later, according to Ann Stefanek, a US Air Force spokeswoman. Who was Sutherland Springs gunman? Gov Abbott said: ""It's clear this is a person who had violent tendencies, who had some challenges, and someone who was a powder keg, seeming waiting to go off.""

Air Force 'failed' to flag Texas gunman,"Kelley is believed to have been in a family row with his ex-wife and in-laws, police say The US Air Force has said it is investigating its apparent failure to enter information about Texas gunman Devin Patrick Kelley's criminal history into the national database. Ex-airman Kelley was court-martialled for domestic violence in 2012, and was barred from owning or buying guns. But last year he was able to purchase a rifle he used in Sunday's attack on a small church outside San Antonio. He killed 26 people and fled the scene. He was later found dead in his car. Police said he died from what appeared to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound after being chased by armed bystanders. Kelley was also shot in his leg and torso by a citizen, the regional director for the Texas Department of Public Safety, Freeman Martin, was quoted as saying by the Associated Press. The small town where everyone knows a victim Why are US mass shootings getting more deadly? In a statement, the Air Force said: ""Initial information indicates that [Devin] Kelley's domestic violence offense was not entered into the National Criminal Information Center database by the Holloman Air Force Base Office of Special Investigations."" This video can not be played How the Texas church mass shooting unfolded It said it was now - together with the Department of Defense - investigating the handling of Kelley's criminal records. Texas Governor Greg Abbott earlier said Kelley, 26, should not legally have been allowed to own a firearm, after having been denied a gun owner's permit by the state. Kelley bought the rifle from the Academy Sports + Outdoors shop in San Antonio. The store issued a statement sending ""deep condolences"" to the victims' families. Kelley was armed with the semi-automatic rifle and two pistols when he attacked the First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs during Sunday services. He had argued with his mother-in-law before the rampage, officials said. Kelley called his father after he was shot by an armed bystander and said he did not think he would survive. This video can not be played 'Our kids play together,' says a resident whose neighbours are feared dead ""This was not racially motivated, it wasn't over religious beliefs,"" said Mr Martin. ""There was a domestic situation going on with the family and in-laws,"" he said, adding that Kelley had sent threatening texts to his mother-in-law. ""We know that he expressed anger towards his mother-in-law, who attends this church,"" Mr Martin added. Twenty-six crosses were put in a field in Sutherland Spring - one cross for each of the victims On Monday evening, a vigil was held in Sutherland Springs. In one corner of the field, music played, people prayed, and hundreds of people held their hands in the air, the BBC's Owen Amos reports. In another, a floodlight illuminated 26 crosses - one for each person shot dead. Johnnie Langendorff (second right) and another man chased the shooter out of town Standing at the back, a feather in his cowboy hat, was Johnnie Langendorff - one of two men who chased the shooter out of town. People queued to shake Mr Langendorff's hand. At one point, a couple embraced him, and they stood in prayer for two or three minutes, our correspondent says. Wilson County Sheriff Joe Tackitt said between 12 and 14 children were among those killed in the attack in Sutherland Springs, a small town 30 miles (50km) south-east of the city of San Antonio. The youngest of those who died was only a year old. This video can not be played 'Belle died with her church family,' her mother said As many as eight members of the Holcombe family were killed in the shooting,the Washington Post reported,external. The BBC spoke to the Holcombes' neighbour Pauline Garza, who said the family did not come back from church. Sutherland Springs: The victims America's gun culture in 10 charts The First Baptist Church's pastor, Frank Pomeroy, told US media his 14-year-old daughter, Annabelle, was among those killed. Twenty people were also wounded. Kelley was court-martialled in 2012 after he was accused of assault against his wife and step-son. He was sentenced to 12 months' confinement. He received a ""bad conduct"" discharge two years later, according to Ann Stefanek, a US Air Force spokeswoman. Who was Sutherland Springs gunman? Gov Abbott said: ""It's clear this is a person who had violent tendencies, who had some challenges, and someone who was a powder keg, seeming waiting to go off."" Kelley worked till last July as a security guard for an amusement park run by the Schlitterbahn company in New Braunfels near Sutherland Springs.

Sturgeon makes gay convictions apologyThe move coincides with new legislation to pardon gay men convicted of offences that are no longer illegal.15m16 minutes agoScotland,"This video can not be played 'This was a wrong committed by the state' Nicola Sturgeon has offered an unequivocal apology to gay men convicted of sexual offences that are no longer illegal. The first minister's apology coincided withnew legislation that will automatically pardon gay and bisexual men,externalconvicted under historical laws. The bill will also allow the removal of such convictions from criminal records. Consensual homosexual acts between men aged over 21 in Scotland were only decriminalised in 1981. And it was not until 20 years later that the age of consent for gay men was lowered to 16. Speaking in the Scottish Parliament, the first minister said it was ""shocking"" that consenting sexual activity between men in Scotland was still classed as a criminal activity until so recently. She added: ""Before then, hundreds of people in Scotland were liable to be convicted as criminals, simply for loving another adult."" Brian Taylor: Sturgeon's apology greeted by tears of joy Coming Oot: A history of gay Scotland Click here for the Holyrood Live report And the first minister said the simple fact was that parliamentarians in Scotland had, over many decades, supported or at least accepted laws which ""we now recognise to have been completely unjust"". Ms Sturgeon said: ""Those laws criminalised the act of loving another adult; they deterred people from being honest about their identity to family, friends, neighbours and colleagues; and by sending a message from parliament that homosexuality was wrong, they encouraged rather than deterred homophobia and hate. ""Today as first minister I categorically, unequivocally and wholeheartedly apologise for those laws and for the hurt and the harm that they caused to so many. ""Nothing that this parliament does can erase those injustices, but I do hope this apology, alongside our new legislation, can provide some comfort to those who endured those injustices ""And I hope that it provides evidence of this parliament's determination in so far as we can to address the harm that was done."" Two men sitting in the public gallery became visibly emotional as Ms Sturgeon made her apology The apology was made on the same day as the publication of the Historical Sexual Offences (Pardons and Disregards) Bill. The legislation will give an automatic pardon to gay men convicted under historical discriminatory laws - but will not apply to behaviour that is still illegal today. It will also enable men to apply to have convictions for same-sex sexual activity that is now legal removed from central criminal conviction records. Justice Secretary Michael Matheson said the new legislation was an important step towards addressing the injustice faced by many gay men in the past. He added: ""These discriminatory laws, although abolished, continue to have implications for people to this day and it is only right that we address this historic wrong, which criminalised people simply because of who they loved."" The bill would give an automatic formal pardon to people, both living and dead, who were convicted of historical sexual offences where the conviction was for conduct which is now legal. However, the pardon is a purely symbolic acknowledgement that the laws were discriminatory, and it does not reverse the conviction. Anyone with a historical conviction for same-sex sexual activity that is now legal would have to apply for a formal ""disregard"" in order to prevent the information being included in disclosure checks. It would then be up to Scottish ministers to decide, based on the available evidence about the specific case, whether the disregard is granted. A successful disregard application means the conviction will not appear on any background check carried out by Disclosure Scotland, and the person will be treated as not having committed the offence. Derek Ogg, a QC who has campaigned for gay rights for decades, told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme that it was a ""wonderful day"". He added: ""It's Scotland at peace with itself and it is a reconciliation between the people in Scotland who are alive and the families of gay people who are dead, who were prosecuted, convicted, simply because of the gender of the person they loved or fancied. ""You can't underestimate the scars that leaves on people. I've never been convicted of such an offence but the fact is that the law was there and could have been used, I could have been arrested. ""I was at the very beginning of my legal career - my career would have been destroyed. An apology, together with the pardons bill, is appropriate."" As Labour's Kezia Dugdale noted, apologies are rare events in politics and customarily have to be wrung from an unwilling government by the persistence of opposition parties. This, as she also generously noted, was of a very different character. It was a sincere apology from the FM, delivered with power and empathy. Furthermore, Nicola Sturgeon was apologising on behalf of a much wider constituency. By definition, she was not apologising for personal or political failings. Her government had nothing to do with historic laws banning gay sex. Indeed, through such initiatives as gay marriage, their actions have been decidedly in the liberal direction. But Ms Sturgeon explained that she felt the apology was a proper accompaniment to the bill proposing an automatic pardon with a concomitant right to obtain the disregard of convictions in record books. His views were echoed by former Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale, who praised Ms Sturgeon for making the apology on behalf of previous governments. Ms Dugdale told the Holyrood chamber: ""This matters because it effects men who are alive today. But it also matters to those who are no longer here. ""We can not risk complacency, and upholding anti-discriminatory laws is critical. Today is a landmark day in Scotland's LGBT history."" Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson added her ""unequivocal and wholehearted"" apology to that of the first minister. Ms Davidson said: ""My hope for those men and their families is that they now feel a weight lifted and that as well as criminal records formally being wiped clean, any lingering sense of legal stigma, any last shadow of unfair disgrace, is firmly banished."" And Scottish Greens co-convener Patrick harvie said he came out as a teenager when the age of consent was still 21. Gay and bisexual men convicted of now-abolished sexual offences in England and Wales received posthumous pardons in January, with thousands of living men convicted over consensual same-sex relationships also eligible for the pardon. It followed the pardoning of World War Two code-breaker Alan Turing for gross indecency in 2013. Private homosexual acts between men aged over 21 were decriminalised in England and Wales in 1967.

The chief minister of Delhi, Arvind Kejriwal, has asked his education minister to consider shutting down schools for a few days. Delhi sees pollution levels soar in winter due to farmers in neighbouring Punjab and Haryana states burning stubble to clear their fields. Activists say very little has been done to stop the practice despite Delhi facing severe pollution for a number of years. Low wind speeds, dust from construction sites, rubbish burning in the capital and firecrackers used in festivals also contribute to increasing pollution levels. The governmentenacted a plan in Octoberto combat some of these problems. The plan includes traffic restrictions and the shutdown of a major power plant.Last year car rationing was trialled in an attempt to curb pollution. But none of the measures seem to have had much impact. Some Twitter users believe that the problem needs a long-term solution instead of a ""piecemeal approach"". Allow Twitter content?

Trump urges N Korea to 'come to table',"Mr Trump said he ""hoped to God"" he would not have to use the US' full military capabilities against Pyongyang US President Donald Trump has urged North Korea to ""come to the table"" and discuss giving up its nuclear weapons. Striking a different tone from previous fiery rhetoric, he said he ""hoped to God"" he did not have to use the US military against Pyongyang. Mr Trump was speaking at a press conference with his South Korean counterpart Moon Jae-in in Seoul, as part of his tour of Asia. The US leader haspreviously threatened ""fire and fury"" against Pyongyang. He is on a five-nation tour of Asia, where North Korea's nuclear ambitions have been high on his agenda. Trump vows to tackle N Korea on Asia trip N Korea: Where is the war of words heading? North Korea crisis explained in 300 words At a press conference, Mr Trump and Mr Moon reiterated their call for the North to denuclearise, with Mr Trump saying it ""makes sense for North Korea to come to the table"", and to ""do the right thing, not only for North Korea but for humanity all over the world"". Though the US had deployed a significant military presence in the region, he said he ""hoped to God"" he would not have to use it against North Korea. The two leaders also called on China and Russia to put pressure on Pyongyang, and said they were lifting the limit on South Korean missile payloads, which they had agreed to do in September. Mr Trump and Mr Moon held talks on Tuesday on trade and North Korea's nuclear programme Mr Trump also said that South Korea would be ordering ""billions of dollars"" in military equipment from the US, which he said would reduce their trade deficit. What has Trump said about your country? It was unclear if a deal was already struck, but Mr Moon said they had agreed to ""begin consultations on acquisitions"" that would enhance South Korea's defence capabilities. Mr Trump had earlier tweeted that""massive military and energy orders"" from Japan were also happening,external, and claimed on Monday thatJapan could shoot down Pyongyang's missiles with US equipment. Japan's leader Shinzo Abe said earlier that he was considering it. This video can not be played How could war with North Korea unfold? Though the US president will only spend about 24 hours in South Korea, it is perhaps the most symbolic stop in his Asian tour, says the BBC's Robin Brant in Seoul. The trip is designed to bolster the military alliance that has long protected South Korea, and strength in unity is the message they want to send to North Korean leader Kim Jong-un just across the border, says our correspondent. But the two leaders also have their differences. Mr Trump haspreviously accused Mr Moon's government of trying to appease the North,external. He has also previously criticised the free trade agreement between the US and South Korea, and has made clear he wants to re-negotiate its terms. Mr Trump, during the press conference, said the deal had been ""quite unsuccessful"" for the US, and that the two countries were going to ""pursue a much better deal"".

Gunmen storm TV station in Kabul,"This video can not be played Afghan security used explosives to reach the TV station attackers An Afghan television station has returned to air just hours after an attack by militants left at least one staff member dead. Gunmen disguised as police officers stormed the Shamshad TV building in the Afghan capital Kabul. So-called Islamic State later said it was behind the attack. But soon after Afghan security forces brought the raid under control, a Shamshad anchor was back on the channel, reporting on the assault. At least three attackers were involved, armed with guns and grenades. The station said one blew himself up at the entrance gate while another went up to the roof to fire at security forces. Staff were trapped inside, with some jumping out of windows and others escaping through a neighbouring building. Normal programmes were replaced with a still image. Special forces had to blast their way through a wall protecting the station to enter. A security guard has been confirmed killed and 20 people wounded. The mother of a female journalist at the station told the BBC she had received no news of her daughter, hours after the attack. One of the news presenters, with his hand bandaged from cutting himself on broken glass, gave details of the assault to viewers. ""We have all come back [to work], all our journalists and colleagues are back on duty,"" he said. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Non-food sales in slowest growth on record,"Sales of non-food items grew at the slowest pace since records began as families chose days out over shopping, the British Retail Consortium has said. Non-food sales rose by just 0.2% in the year to October, the weakest growth since the BRC began measuring the category in January 2011. The retail body said the figures would give retailers ""cause for concern"" in the run up to Christmas. Clothing sales were ""particularly hard hit"", it said. Total retail sales, including food, rose just 0.2% last month, compared with 2.4% last year. On a like-for-like basis, which excludes new store openings, sales were down 1%. The High Street struggling to survive BRC chief executive Helen Dickinson said ""consumers appear to have opted for outdoor experiences and excursions during half term, over visits to the shops"". The figures  - which were compiled with accountancy firm KPMG - come just seven weeks before Christmas, the key trading period for most retailers. Ms Dickinson said that the rise in inflation, which hit its highest for more than five years in September, was making shoppers ""ever more cautious in considering what purchases they can afford"". Several clothing chains have been struggling as the High Street faces tough competition from online retailers such as Asos. On Tuesday, fashion chain New Look reported a loss of Â£10.4m for the six months to 23 September, a marked reversal from the profit of Â£59.3m seen in the same period last year. UK like-for-like sales at the retailer fell 8.4%. Analysis: Emma Simpson, business correspondent It's been a pretty dismal month for non-food retailers, especially fashion. The warm weather won't have helped, but even so, these figures will be a concern as the all-important Christmas trading gets into gear. With prices rising faster than wages, consumers have less money to spend on non-essential items. Retailers are also grappling with the effects of a weaker pound as well as other cost pressures. That's on top of all the structural challenges, with the continuing shift to online. It's clear that the going's really challenging right now for a number of retailers.  Next has already warned of ""extremely volatile"" trading. The first real clue on how Christmas is shaping up will be Black Friday at the end of this month. Are shoppers merely holding back for a splurge and will some retailers now be forced to join the fray in order to shift stock at a discount to generate much-needed sales? ""The results reflect another tough period of trading for the company amid a challenging retail environment on the UK High Street,""said New Look executive chairman Alistair McGeorge,external, adding that ""the retailer is not anticipating a reversal in fortunes overnight."" Last week,Next reported,externalthat sales at its High Street stores had fallen by 7.7% in the year to 29  October, noting that ""sales performance has remained extremely volatile and is highly dependent on the seasonality of the weather"". Paul Martin, head of retail at the accountancy firm KPMG, said that October marked a ""reversal of fortunes for retailers"". He said: ""After a brief uptick, fashion sales reverted back to the dreary theme we have seen for a number of months this year. Unseasonably warm weather last month will not have helped, but this is unlikely to be the only reason the new ranges are proving unpopular."" Mr Martin said that retailers will be hoping that consumers are saving up for Black Friday, the post-Thanksgiving shopping bonanza in the US which has become a key date for retailers in the UK. This year it falls on 24 November, two days after the Budget. Ms Dickinson said that the Chancellor Philip Hammond should reflect on the ""disappointing state of play"" when he gives his speech on 22 November and ""deliver a Budget that allays the risks of a further slowdown in consumer spending, by keeping down the cost of living.  In other words, a shoppers' Budget.""

'Tubby and terrified': How fear puts girls off PE,"Gracie says learning to love PE has transformed her life Gracie Rowe used to be terrified of PE. ""I was on the tubby side. ""My personal self-consciousness was like a devil on my shoulder telling me I couldn't do it. ""It was the fact that I had to move, be active and sweat. ""I would just stand and watch and mope."" Gracie says she had zero self-confidence when she started secondary school. She was so nervous that she tried to persuade her mum she was sick most days and twice-weekly PE lessons were a particular source of stress. ""I was worried that people judged me. It was because I wasn't happy with myself."" The school's PE uniform didn't help: ""It was a 'skort' - sort of shorts and skirt in one - and it was quite tight and short. ""All my friends hated PE just as much as I did."" Hayley Wood-Thompson, Gracie's PE teacher at The John Warner School in Hertfordshire, says about half of the girls feel the same. The school shares its site with a sports centre, so has the use of excellent facilities. ""We offer quite a broad spectrum of activities. There is a dance studio and swimming pool. But lots of the girls are still turned off by it."" Hayley Wood-Thompson is a PE teacher at The John Warner School The UK's chief medical officer recommends school-age children do at least an hour of exercise each day. But new research with 25,000 secondary students in England and Northern Ireland suggests that, at secondary level, only 8% of girls and 16% of boys manage this. Of the teenagers, surveyed by Youth Sport Trust and Women in Sport, more than 80% understood the importance of being active but almost half of boys and nearly two-thirds of girls were less than keen on taking part themselves. The research suggests lack of confidence is key. Among girls over 14, more than a third said they felt insecure, hated other people watching them and were self-conscious about their bodies. Almost two-thirds said they disliked competitive PE lessons. Gracie's mum and her teachers realised they had to boost her confidence to ensure she attended school. Her mum brought her in for meetings with the head of year - and the school enrolled her on to a healthy living project to improve her self-esteem. At the same time, big reforms to the school's PE programme were under way, designed to encourage girls to engage with the subject. First off, skorts were out, replaced by black sports leggings. ""It's the sort of thing you might wear to the gym on a Saturday morning. It feels a bit more adult,"" says Ms Wood-Thompson. The school also now divides its PE programme into pathways, allowing girls and boys to choose how much competitive and outdoors sport to do. ""The girls-only pathway is tailored to boosting levels of confidence. ""There will be a bit more aerobics, dance, being inside in the winter. So they're not turned off by being outside in the rain and cold. ""More sporty girls are offered a mixed programme with the less athletic boys - this might involve dodgeball, football and more competitive games. ""And sporty boys have a boys-only programme."" Gracie's activities include field days and camps with the Combined Cadet Force Gracie Rowe chose the girls-only pathway and liked it. ""It was just the fact that we didn't need to show off to anyone or act like someone we're not."" Gradually her confidence improved. She not only started to join in PE, but began to enjoy it and made friends. ""It helped me forget what other people thought of me and have confidence in myself."" Now 14, she is no longer tubby, plays in the football team for her school year, takes dance classes and is in the gym ""all the time"". She also joined the Combined Cadet Force run at a nearby private school, knows how a rifle works and takes part in field days and camps. Last year the school nominated her as a leader on theYouth Sport Trust's Girls' Active programme,,externalwhich aims to tackle girls' negative body images, improve attitudes to physical activity and to make sport more relevant to them. Girls Active encourages girls who have overcome their fear of PE to help their classmates ""She has made the biggest improvement I have ever seen,"" says her PE teacher. ""I know that not every girl is going to have a fully positive experience in every PE lesson every day but I hope I can enthuse them enough to encourage them to take part. It's all about relationships."" She hopes the young leaders on the programme will help other girls overcome barriers to physical activity. ""They are very keen to improve the mental health and self-esteem of their peers. ""They really care about trying to remove the stigma of being active and getting sweaty and to foster a happy, supportive and relaxed environment for PE."" Gracie says a myriad of factors can stop girls being active ""but you realise you don't have to be like that or think like that"". ""I feel empowered now to influence other girls who were like me by showing them that there is no limit to what you can do. ""It doesn't matter on your size, age or ability level, start with what you are comfortable with and push those boundaries. Don't let anyone hold you back.""

Apple's secret tax bolthole revealedParadise Papers: All you need to knowLewis Hamilton 'dodged' VAT on private jetCorbyn calls for apologies over taxBono linked to tax probe in Lithuania,"This video can not be played Paradise Papers: Appleâs secret tax bolthole revealed The world's most profitable firm has a secretive new structure that would enable it to continue avoiding billions in taxes, the Paradise Papers show. They reveal how Apple sidestepped a 2013 crackdown on its controversial Irish tax practices by actively shopping around for a tax haven. It then moved the firm holding most of its untaxed offshore cash, now $252bn, to the Channel Island of Jersey. Apple said the new structure had not lowered its taxes. It said it remained the world's largest taxpayer, paying about $35bn (Â£26bn) in corporation tax over the past three years, that it had followed the law and its changes ""did not reduce our tax payments in any country"". In a further statement,externalthe company stressed that no operations or investments had been moved from Ireland. TheParadise Papers,externalis the name for a huge leak of financial documents that is throwing light on the world of offshore finance. Follow all the latest updates Lewis Hamilton 'dodged' VAT on jet Questions over African mining deal Mrs Brown's Boys stars 'put money offshore' Up until 2014, the tech company had been exploiting a loophole in tax laws in the US and the Republic of Ireland known as the ""double Irish"". This allowed Apple to funnel all its sales outside of the Americas - currently about 55% of its revenue - through Irish subsidiaries that were effectively stateless for taxation purposes, and so incurred hardly any tax. Instead of paying Irish corporation tax of 12.5%, or the US rate of 35%, Apple's avoidance structure helped it reduce its tax rate on profits outside of the US to the extent that its foreign tax payments rarely amounted to more than 5% of its foreign profits, and in some years dipped below 2%. The European Commission calculated the rate of tax for one of Apple's Irish companies for one year had been just 0.005%. This video can not be played Apple CEO Tim Cook: ""We pay all the taxes we owe. Every single dollar"" Apple came under pressure in 2013 in the US Senate, when CEO Tim Cook was forced to defend its tax system. Angry that the US was missing out on a huge amount of tax, then-Senator Carl Levin told him: ""You shifted that golden goose to Ireland. You shifted it to three companies that do not pay taxes in Ireland. These are the crown jewels of Apple Inc. Folks, it's not right."" Mr Cook responded defiantly: ""We pay all the taxes we owe, every single dollar. We do not depend on tax gimmicks... We do not stash money on some Caribbean island."" After the EU announced in 2013 that it was investigating Apple's Irish arrangement, the Irish government decided that firms incorporated there could no longer be stateless for tax purposes. This video can not be played Panorama's Richard Bilton tries to speak to Appleby about Apple in Jersey In order to keep its tax rates low, Apple needed to find an offshore financial centre that would serve as the tax residency for its Irish subsidiaries. In March 2014, Apple's legal advisers sent a questionnaire to Appleby, a leading offshore finance law firm and source of much of the Paradise Papers leak. It asked what benefits different offshore jurisdictions - the British Virgin Islands, Bermuda, the Cayman Islands, Mauritius, the Isle of Man, Jersey and Guernsey - could offer Apple. The document asked key questions such as was it possible to ""obtain an official assurance of tax exemption"" and could it be confirmed that an Irish company might ""conduct management activitiesâ¦ without being subject to taxation in your jurisdiction"". They also asked whether a change of government was likely, what information would be visible to the public and how easy it would be to exit the jurisdiction. Leaked emails also make it clear that Apple wanted to keep the move secret. One email sent between senior partners at Appleby says: ""For those of you who are not aware, Apple [officials] are extremely sensitive concerning publicity. They also expect the work that is being done for them only to be discussed amongst personnel who need to know."" Apple chose Jersey, a UK Crown dependency that makes its own tax laws and which has a 0% corporate tax rate for foreign companies. Paradise Papers documents show Apple's two key Irish subsidiaries, Apple Operations International (AOI), believed to hold most of Apple's massive $252bn overseas cash hoard, and Apple Sales International (ASI), were managed from Appleby's office in Jersey from the start of 2015 until early 2016. This would have enabled Apple to continue avoiding billions in tax around the world. Paradise Papers: All you need to know Apple's 2017 accounts showed they made $44.7bn outside the US and paid just $1.65bn in taxes to foreign governments, a rate of around 3.7%. That is less than a sixth of the average rate of corporation tax in the world. In August 2016, after a three-year investigation,the European Commission finds that Ireland gave an illegal tax benefit to Apple,external. The EC says Apple must repay Ireland taxes for the period within its remit of investigation, 2003-2013, a total of â¬13bn (Â£11.6bn) plus interest of â¬1bn. Ireland and Applelaunch an appeal. Apple's Tim Cook calls the EC ruling ""total political crap"", with ""no reason for it in fact or in law"". Ireland says the EU is encroaching on sovereign taxation. It fears multinationals will go elsewhere. Ireland agrees to collect the â¬13bn, to be held in a managed escrow account pending the appeal verdict. In October 2017, the EU says it will take Ireland to court as it has not yet collected the money. Ireland says it is complicated and it needs time. Tim Cook's claims examined When the ""double-Irish"" loophole was shut down, Ireland also created new tax regulations that companies like Apple could take advantage of. One of the companies that Apple moved to Jersey, ASI, had rights to some of Apple Inc's hugely valuable intellectual property. If ASI sold the intellectual property back to an Irish company, the Irish company would be able to offset the enormous cost against any future profits. And since the IP holder, ASI, was registered in Jersey, the profits of the sale would not be taxed. It appears Apple has done just that. There was an extraordinary 26% spike in Ireland's GDP in 2015which media reports,externalput down to intellectual property assets moving into Ireland. Intangible assets rose a massive â¬250bn in Ireland that year. Ireland's department of finance denied that the new regulations had been brought in to benefit multinationals. It said Ireland was ""not unique in allowing companies to claim capital allowances on intangible assets"" and had followed ""the international norm"". This video can not be played Investigative journalist Richard Brooks on Appleâs questionnaire and the Isle of Manâs response to it Apple declined to answer questions about its two subsidiaries moving their tax residency to Jersey. It also declined to comment when asked whether one of those companies had helped create a huge tax write-off by selling intellectual property. Apple said: ""When Ireland changed its tax laws in 2015, we complied by changing the residency of our Irish subsidiaries and we informed Ireland, the European Commission and the United States. ""The changes we made did not reduce our tax payments in any country. In fact, our payments to Ireland increased significantly and over the last three years we've paid $1.5bn in tax there.""

A number of stories are appearing in a week-long expose of how politicians, multinationals, celebrities and high-net-worth individuals use complex structures to protect their cash from higher taxes. As with last year's Panama Papers leak, the documents were obtained by the German newspaperSÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung,external, which called in theInternational Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ),externalto oversee the investigation.BBC Panoramaand theGuardian,externalare among the nearly 100 media groups investigating the papers. The Paradise Papers name was chosen because of the idyllic profiles of many of the offshore jurisdictions whose workings are unveiled, including Bermuda, the HQ of the main company involved,Appleby. It also dovetails nicely with the French term for a tax haven - paradis fiscal. Then again, the Isle of Man plays a big part. The offshore financial affairs of hundreds of politicians, multinationals, celebrities and high-net-worth individuals, some of them household names, have been revealed. The papers also throw light on the legal firms, financial institutions and accountants working in the sector and on the jurisdictions that adopt offshore tax rules to attract money. These are the stories so far: Prince Charles campaigned to alter climate-change agreementswithout disclosing his private estate had an offshore financial interest in what he was promoting Apple has protected its low-tax regimeby using the Channel Island of Jersey Formula 1 championLewis Hamilton avoided tax on his Â£16.5m luxury jet, the papers suggest The Queen's private estateinvested about Â£10m offshoreincluding a small amount in the company behind BrightHouse, a chain accused of irresponsible lending One of President Donald Trump's top administration officialskept a financial stake in a firm whose major partners include a Russian companypart-owned by President Vladimir Putin's son-in-law An entrepreneur charged with managing the oil wealth of the struggling African state of Angolawas paid more than $41m in just 20 months A Lithuanian shopping mallpartly owned by U2 star Bonois under investigation for potential tax evasion How three stars of the hit BBC sitcom, Mrs Brown's Boys,diverted more than Â£2m into an offshore tax-avoidance scheme One of the world's largest firmsloaned a businessman previously accused of corruption $45mand asked him to negotiate mining rights in the DR Congo The Isle of Manpassed a law that would help tax evaders, the documents show A key aide of Canada's PM has beenlinked to offshore schemesthat may have cost the nation millions of dollars in taxes, threatening to embarrass Justin Trudeau Lord Ashcroft, a former Conservative party deputy chairman and a significant donor,may have broken the rules around how his offshore investments were managed.

There are more than 1,400GB of data, containing about 13.4 million documents. Some 6.8 million come from the offshore legal service providerAppleby,externaland corporate services provider Estera. The two operated together under the Appleby name until Estera became independent in 2016. Another six million documents come from corporate registries in some 19 jurisdictions, mostly in the Caribbean. A smaller amount comes from the Singapore-based international trust and corporate services provider,Asiaciti Trust,external.  The leaked data covers seven decades, from 1950 to 2016. A law firm that helps corporations, financial institutions and high-net-worth individuals set up and register companies in offshore jurisdictions. Founded in Bermuda and with a history dating back to the 1890s, it has become one of the largest and best known of about 10 major companies involved in the specialist arena. The leak shows the US dominates Appleby's client register, with more than 31,000 US addresses for clients. There were more than 14,000 UK addresses and 12,000 in Bermuda. Who are Appleby? As with 2016'sPanama Papers, German newspaper SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung obtained the original material and was the stepping off point for this investigation. In the case of the Panama Papers, the originator of the leaks, named only as John Doe, issued a manifesto a month after the publication date. A simple statement this time says: ""For their protection, SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung does as a general policy not comment on its sources!"" As with the Panama Papers, theInternational Consortium of Investigative Journalists,external, a global network of investigative journalists, was called in to work on the project. Along with the BBC's flagship Panorama programme, there are nearly 100 media partners involved in 67 countries, including theGuardian,externaland theNew York Times,external. The media partners say the investigation is in the public interest because data leaks from the world of offshore have repeatedly exposed wrongdoing. The leaks have led to hundreds of investigations worldwide, resulting in politicians, ministers and even prime ministers being forced from office. The $64m question, or probably more if you are in a tax haven, or offshore financial centre as the industry  prefers to call it. It is indeed thefifth major leak of financial papers in the past four yearsand, yes, last year's Panama Papers were bigger in size - 2.6TB to 1.4TB - but the scale of the information in the Paradise Papers and how it lifts the lid on sophisticated, upper-end offshore dealings, many linked to the UK, is unprecedented. As Gerard Ryle, who oversees member journalists at the ICIJ, says: ""This leak is important because it's the high end of town. People may have dismissed the Mossack Fonseca leaks as they were rogue players who would take any client. Most of the offshore world is not like that at all. Here you have the gold-plated company."" The documents were tougher than the Panama Papers too. Mr Ryle says: ""They came in different formats and it took us a long time to decipher them. There were nice surprises along the way but it was a much more difficult data set."" It's hard to pin down an exact definition. Tax haven is the term usually used in the media and public, whereas the industry would prefer the term offshore financial centre (OFC). It is essentially a financial jurisdiction outside the regulations of your own nation used by companies and individuals to lower their taxes on profits or assets. They are usually secretive and stable. They are also often small islands, many of them UK Crown Dependencies or Overseas Territories, but not exclusively so. Nations such as Switzerland, Ireland and the Netherlands have similar tax reducing mechanisms, while the UK and the US are leading nations providing services that facilitate the use of OFCs.

Lewis Hamilton 'dodged' VAT on private jetCorbyn calls for apologies over taxBono linked to tax probe in Lithuania,"This video can not be played Paradise Papers: How Lewis Hamilton got a Â£3.3m VAT refund Formula 1 champion Lewis Hamilton avoided tax on his Â£16.5m luxury jet, according toParadise Papersdocuments. They show a Â£3.3m VAT refund was given after the Bombardier Challenger 605 was imported into the Isle of Man in 2013. It appears a leasing deal set up by advisers was artificial and did not comply with an EU and UK ban on refunds for private use - although he may have been entitled to one for business. Hamilton's lawyers say a tax barrister review found the structure was lawful. They added it was not correct to say no VAT had been paid on any of the arrangements. A statement later issued by the racing driver's representative said: ""As a global sportsman who pays tax in a large number of countries, Lewis relies upon a team of professional advisers who manage his affairs. ""Those advisers have assured Lewis that everything is above board and the matter is now in the hands of his lawyers."" At 06:15 on 21 January 2013, Hamilton touched down at Ronaldsway airport on the Isle of Man in his new jet with his then-pop star girlfriend Nicole Scherzinger to finalise the paperwork with customs. While Hamilton's planned use of the jet was predominantly for business purposes, the BBC's Panorama programme has seen documents which suggest the 32-year-old F1 Mercedes driver intended to make private flights about a third of the time. Hamilton's plane carries the private registration G-LCDH (Lewis Carl Davidson Hamilton) Hamilton's social media accounts provide evidence he has used the candy apple red Challenger for holidays and on other personal trips around the world. He has posted a number of photographs of himself on the plane on Instagram - including one showing his bulldogs Roscoe and Coco on board. Allow Instagram content?

""If private usage of the jet is being disguised as business usage of the jet, then what you essentially have is a tax avoidance scheme,"" says Rita De La Feria, professor of tax law at Leeds University. ""You're using it for your own private interests, you're going on holidays, meeting friends. You're supposed to pay the tax on private consumption."" Private jets purchased outside the EU are subject to 20% VAT on importation in order to qualify for free circulation within the bloc. While the Isle of Man is not part of the EU, it is a British Crown Dependency and forms a common area with the UK for VAT purposes. Because of this link, an aircraft imported via the island is granted full access to the EU. To try and get round EU and UK rules banning VAT refunds on aircraft used by private individuals, Hamilton's advisers formed a VAT-registered leasing business on the Isle of Man, the leaked documents held by offshore law firm Appleby suggest. The new company, Stealth (IOM) Limited, leased the jet from Hamilton's British Virgin Islands company, Stealth Aviation Limited, and imported it into the Isle of Man. It was then leased on to a UK jet management company that provided Hamilton with a crew and other services - and which leased it back to Hamilton and his Guernsey company, BRV Limited. Hamilton is described in the documents as the jet's ""ultimate client"". They also suggest he was being kept up to date. In one email sent ahead of the final signing of the charter agreements and the jet's importation into the Isle of Man, an adviser states: ""I would like to email Lewis his agreement this evening and try to reach him on the phone to talk him through it."" Other documents show the hourly rate of the plane's lease was increased from Â£2,000 to Â£5,500 overnight at one stage, so the Isle of Man company turned a profit as a ""commercial"" aircraft leasing business. On the basis of the transactions, Hamilton's advisers were able to claim a 100% VAT refund on the Â£3.3m he was obliged to pay at the point of importation. But the leasing agreements suggest Hamilton was going to be using the plane 80 hours per month, with his company using it for 160 hours. If this estimate had been used for the basis of the VAT refund, under UK and EU VAT rules, only two thirds could have been considered for a refund in relation to business use. The artificiality of the structure raises questions about whether Hamilton should have received a refund at all. Hamilton secured his fourth F1 title at last month's Mexico Grand Prix Lawyers acting for Hamilton said the driver has a ""set of professionals in place who run most aspects of his business operations and that no subterfuge or improper levels of secrecy had been put in place"". In a statement, they said Stealth (IOM) Limited was formed to run a leasing business and hire the aircraft on a long-term basis at a commercial rate. They added that the company made all necessary disclosures to Isle of Man officials, who approved the approach. The lawyers said that reducing taxes was not the motive, but even if it had been, it is lawful to lease rather than buy in order to reduce VAT. There are 50 schemes like Hamilton's in the Paradise Papers. The documents show that Appleby on the Isle of Man has imported luxury jets worth Â£1.25bn. In total, the island has handed out more than Â£790m in VAT refunds to jet leasing companies, involving more than 230 planes.

The Isle of Man says since 2011 more than 30 assessments for under-declared or over-claimed VAT against businesses in the aircraft leasing sector, with a value of about Â£4.7m, have been raised. Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn last weekcalled on the Prime MinisterTheresa May to launch an investigation into VAT avoidance allegations linked with business jets in the Isle of Man.

Corbyn calls for apologies over taxBono linked to tax probe in Lithuania,"This video can not be played 'Queen should apologise,' suggests Corbyn Jeremy Corbyn has suggested the Queen, among others, should apologise for using overseas tax havens if they were used to avoid taxation in the UK. The Labour leader was asked at the CBI conference whether the Queen should say sorry for making overseas investments. He said anyone putting money into tax havens for the purposes of avoidance should ""not just apologise for it, recognise what it does to our society"". The BBC has revealed that the Queen's estate has used overseas tax havens. Paradise Papers: All you need to know Latest reaction to the Paradise Papers leak It comes after a leak of confidential papers from Bermuda revealed the secret offshore investments of the rich and famous, including the Queen. Mr Corbyn's spokesman later clarified his comments, saying the Labour leader did not specifically call on the Queen to apologise but thought ""anyone who puts money into a tax haven to avoid paying tax should acknowledge the damage it does to society"". This video can not be played The Queen's private estate invested Â£10m in offshore funds Mr Corbyn called for a full inquiry, public lists of company ownership, and a new tax enforcement unit to tackle tax evasion. On Sunday,BBC Panorama broadcastthe first results of its year-long investigation into theParadise Papers,external, a massive leak of financial documents from Bermuda-based law firm Appleby. The leaks raised questions overtech firm Apple's tax structures, the investments ofConservative Party donor Lord Ashcroft,Everton FC owner Farhad Moshiri,Formula 1 champion Lewis Hamilton, and offshore investments made on theQueen's behalf by the Duchy of Lancaster. Buckingham Palace has not commented on the revelation that the Duchy of Lancaster, which handles the Queen's private wealth, used offshore investments. A spokesperson for the Duchy of Lancaster said: ""We operate a number of investments and a few of these are with overseas funds. All of our investments are fully audited and legitimate. ""The Queen voluntarily pays tax on any income she receives from the Duchy."" HMRC chief executive Jon Thompson vowed to ""chase down"" anyone trying to hide money offshore and evade tax. He told the Commons Public Accounts Committee that HMRC had asked to see the leaked Paradise Papers in order to ""look at every case of tax evasion very seriously"". Mr Thompson said there were 66 ongoing criminal investigations into thePanama Papers, which in April 2016 exposed tax avoidance and evasion, saying Â£100m could be retrieved. ""That gives you some sense about how long quite complicated tax cases take to bring to some sort of fruition,"" he added. This video can not be played Theresa May: 'UK already acting' on offshore tax havens Theresa May insisted efforts were already under way to obtain revenue from offshore tax vehicles, adding: ""We want people to pay the tax that is due"". At the CBI conference, the prime minister said HMRC had collected Â£160bn by tackling tax avoidance, evasion and non-compliance since 2010. Mrs May's spokesperson said: ""It is important to point out that holding investments offshore is not an automatic sign of wrongdoing, but HMRC has requested to see the papers urgently so it can look into any allegations."" But when asked, Mrs May did not commit to a public inquiry into tax revenue lost through offshore tax avoidance schemes. Among the Paradise Papers documents was evidence that Tory donorLord Ashcroftremained a non-dom and continued to avoid tax despite attempts to make peers pay their full share. Lord Ashcroft has insisted he did not ignore rules in relation to the Punta Gorda offshore trust and said  his tax residency was ""publicly available information"". The leaked documents show that between 2000 and 2010, Lord Ashcroft received payments of around $200m (Â£150m) from his offshore trust in Bermuda. Responding,externalto the programme, Lord Ashcroft wrote: ""At no point has it been suggested directly to me, or through others, that I have taken any inappropriate action."" He also explained why he ran away from a Panorama reporter who approached him for comment, taking refuge in a toilet, saying he was ""determined"" not to ""fall victim to their ambush"". This video can not be played Watch Lord Ashcroft try to avoid Richard Biltonâs questions about his offshore trust The Paradise Papers puts into question the practice of using highly secretive offshore tax havens, which is legal. Bermuda's premier David Burt said the territory has a ""robust regulatory regime"" with the same tax system in place since 1898. He added the UK's tax law allows the use of offshore tax havens. Former Business Secretary, Sir Vince Cable, criticised the government for not clamping down on offshore tax havens trading under the British flag. He said: ""The Paradise Papers suggest that a small number of wealthy individuals have been able, entirely legally, to put their money beyond the reach of the Exchequer.""

Inside, its decor was sumptuous, the black leather seats piped with red, but outside rain was falling and the temperature on the ground below was a bracing 2C. The date was 21 January 2013, and the island that the plane was heading towards hadn't yet woken up. The candy-red Challenger 605 aircraft carried the registration G-LCDH - the initials of Lewis Carl Davidson Hamilton, the World Championship-winning Formula One driver. The previous month, Hamilton had flown on the jet with his then-girlfriend, the former Pussycat Dolls singer turned X Factor judge Nicole Scherzinger, and their families, to Hawaii for a Christmas holiday. The aircraft’s latest destination wasn’t so celebrated as a hang-out of the rich and famous. It wasn't Monaco or Miami Beach. It wasn’t Dubai. It wasn’t even the Channel Islands. It was the Isle of Man, the Crown Dependency between Ireland and Great Britain best known for its tail-less cats and its motorcycle race. But the plane wasn’t going to stick around for long. At 06:15 it landed. To one side of the runway were the waves of the Irish Sea. To the other was Ronaldsway Airport’s modest cream-and-blue Art Deco terminal building. Despite the early hour, someone was waiting for the jet - an Isle of Man customs official. Hamilton’s advisers had paid a £60 fee for the privilege of getting the official there early to stamp a form that showed VAT had been paid in full. In December 2012, Stealth Aviation Limited - a company of Hamilton’s in the British Virgin Islands - paid $26,817,260 for the jet. Hamilton’s social media accounts show he used it for holidays and other personal jaunts, not only business. On Instagram, he posted several photographs - including one showing his bulldogs, Roscoe and Coco, on board. He was especially proud of its distinctive colour scheme. “Every time I’m at the airport you see these really sad, old white planes, with the saddest stripe down the side,” he told US talk show host Jimmy Kimmell in 2015. “If I get a plane, I’m going to pimp it out.” According to the Sunday Times Rich List, Hamilton has a £131m fortune. Normally, companies that use planes for business reasons are entitled to a VAT refund, but private individuals are not. According to emails held by Appleby, the law firm at the centre of the Paradise Papers leak, Appleby formed a VAT-registered leasing business on the Isle of Man for Lewis Hamilton. The new company, Stealth (IOM) Limited, leased the jet from Hamilton's British Virgin Islands company, Stealth Aviation Limited, and imported it into the Isle of Man. It was then leased again to a UK jet management company that provided Hamilton with a crew and other services - and which leased it back to Lewis Hamilton and his Guernsey company, BRV Limited. Because of these “commercial” transactions, Hamilton’s advisers were able to arrange a 100% VAT refund when the plane landed at Ronaldsway. The £3.3m VAT bill was paid on Hamilton’s behalf by an Isle of Man accountancy firm. So when the aircraft landed, the customs official attending out of hours stamped a VAT-paid form to be kept on board the aircraft. This granted the aircraft “full and free circulation” in the EU. Leasing documents in the Paradise Papers show that Hamilton’s company, BRV Limited, expected to use the plane two-thirds of the time, with him signed up personally to use the other third. EU and UK VAT rules state that refunds should not be granted in relation to private use of aircraft – but Hamilton got a full refund. Hamilton wasn't alone in doing this. More than 50 others have imported planes to the Isle of Man with Appleby’s help. In total, the Isle of Man has refunded more than £790m to 231 aircraft leasing companies that have imported jets. And Paradise Papers documents suggest Lewis Hamilton is far from the only super-rich visitor to get a VAT refund on jets they used for pleasure as well as work. Lawyers acting for Lewis Hamilton say the driver has a “set of professionals in place who run most aspects of his business operations and that no subterfuge or improper levels of secrecy had been put in place"". In a statement, they say Stealth (IOM) Limited was formed to run a leasing business and hire the aircraft on a long-term basis at a commercial rate. They add that the company made all necessary disclosures to Isle of Man officials, who approved the approach. The lawyers said that reducing taxes was not the motive, but even if it had been, it is lawful to lease rather than buy in order to reduce VAT. The Isle of Man has one of the largest private aircraft registries in the world, with about 970 luxury jets officially registered since it began in 2007. In light of the Paradise Papers revelations, the Isle of Man government has invited the UK Treasury to conduct an assessment of the practice of importing aircraft into the EU through the island. It has denied ""mistakenly"" refunding VAT and says it follows the same policies, rules and regulations regarding the treatment of VAT as the UK. Once the form was stamped, Hamilton’s candy-red plane was free to take off again at 08:10. It had spent less than two hours at Ronaldsway, and didn’t even stay long enough to see the sunrise. There’s an old proverb in the Manx language inscribed on the wall of the museum at Douglas, the island’s capital:Nagh insh dou cre va mee, agh insh dou cre tamee. It means: “Don’t tell me what I was, but tell me what I am.” Spend any time on the island, however, and you realise it’s impossible to make sense of its present without grappling with its past. When Phil Craine was growing up there in the 1960s, it very much wasn’t the kind of place racing drivers' private jets dropped by. Phil Craine Instead, his memories are of the promenade in Douglas teeming with working-class holidaymakers from Liverpool, Manchester, Belfast, Glasgow and other industrial cities. He recalls a place of “donkey rides, rowing boats, Punch and Judy, people selling deckchairs and windbreaks - absolutely packed, still, in the 60s”. As a boy, Phil could name each of the eight Steam Packet vessels that brought holidaymakers to and from the Sea Terminal in Douglas. At the Manx tourism industry’s peak, some 600,000 visitors came to the island each year. In the summer months the boarding houses would fill up with tourists, and the industry was the backbone of the Manx economy. It wouldn’t stay that way for long. By the late 1960s, the arrival of the package holiday was starting to hit the island hard. For the price of a week in Douglas or Peel you could fly to Spain and guaranteed sunshine. Average summer visitor numbers were 50,000 fewer in the 60s than in the 50s. Between 1964 and 1970, the number of hotels and guesthouses on the island fell by more than a quarter. When Phil finished school in 1974, it didn’t feel as though there were many prospects for him. Like many others of his generation, he “went across” - the Manx term for travelling to Great Britain - to study and find work. But the Manx people have a habit of coming back from adversity. They had withstood invasion by the Vikings, the Scots and the English, not to mention the decline of the fishing and mining industries. Despite the influence of its larger neighbours, Manx identity remains strong. The most common accent is now a sort of cross between Scouse and Cumbrian, but the native language has undergone something of a revival. Drive around the island, and everywhere, in back gardens and by doorways and infields, you’ll see the Manx triskelion flag - three armoured legs with golden spurs on a red background. Since the 17th Century it has been accompanied by a Latin motto:Quocunque jeceris stabit.It means: “Whichever way you throw me, I shall stand.” The island was able to leverage its unusual constitutional position as a Crown Dependency. Though halfway between Liverpool and Belfast, it isn’t part of the UK or the EU, but has access to both. While the Queen is the head of state and the UK is responsible for the island’s defences, it is self-governing, and sets its own rates of tax. In 1961 the Tynwald, the island’s parliament, began cutting income taxes in order to attract incomers. In the 70s, there was an influx of merchant and commercial banks too. By 1980, the top rate of income tax was set at 20%, where it is still today, and the maximum amount payable remains capped. Currently the corporation tax rate is 0%, compared with 19% in the UK. On the Isle of Man there is no capital gains tax, inheritance tax or stamp duty. The effect of all this was an economic boom on the tiny island. Over the past 30 years, its economic growth has been three times that of the UK’s. Some critics have argued that the island's economy has become too reliant on finance. The Manx government rejects this. ""We have a fully diversified economy,"" says Howard Quayle, the chief minister. ""Our e-business sector is just as big as our financial services."" The government points to a burgeoning space industry, cheese, scallops and films – more than 100 movies and television series have been shot on Man since 1995. While he studied commerce at Liverpool University and, later, trained as an accountant in London, Phil would regularly come home to visit his family and, each time, he noticed its remarkable transformation. I was living off the island and I thought: ‘Good old Isle of Man, it’s doing really well, notching up these double-digit increases in growth.’” He didn’t think too much about where that growth was coming from. That would come later, and it set Phil on a collision course with many of his fellow islanders. In the middle of Douglas, a short walk up the hill from the marina at Douglas Harbour, there’s a thoroughfare of anonymous-looking Georgian terraces called Athol Street. The buildings all look smart, if unassuming. You could be in almost any British town. But if you look closely at the names of the firms operating here, you’ll realise this is no ordinary road. Among the companies along here are KPMG, Zurich International Life and Appleby - the firm at the centre of the Paradise Papers, a huge leak of financial documents that sheds light on how the ultra-wealthy invest their cash. This is the centre of the Isle of Man’s financial district. This island, with its population of less than 85,000, has more than 30,000 registered companies. Some 17% of the island’s income comes from banking, finance and business services and the same proportion comes from insurance. Each lunchtime, office workers in pinstripe suits emerge from Athol Street’s buildings. Many huddle together in Coffee Exchange or the Courthouse bar around a laptop or a sheaf of papers, keeping their voices low as they talk business. There’s the occasional visible indication that this is a place apart, like the sign in the window of The Thirsty Pigeon pub declaring that it accepts Bitcoin. Unlike some once-popular British seaside resorts, the town looks quietly prosperous. For the most part, the former boarding houses along the promenade in Douglas are clean and freshly painted. But for all the money that passes through the island, you don’t see the kind of conspicuous wealth you’d expect in Monaco or even Jersey. On Manx roads you’ll spot the occasional Rolls Royce or Ferrari, but a lot more Hondas and Fords. There are some good restaurants in Douglas, but none have a Michelin Star. On Strand Street, the capital’s main shopping thoroughfare, if you look hard enough you can find Lacoste, Hugo Boss, Vivienne Westwood and other designer brands on the shelves. But there are many more branches of the shops you would find on any British High Street - TK Maxx, River Island, Boots and Dorothy Perkins. In Ramsey, in the north of the island, there’s a “superyacht helicopter consultancy” with frosted-glass windows. Across the street is the Stanley pub, whose chalkboard promises games night on Wednesdays and karaoke at the weekend. A sprinkling of well-known, well-off celebrities have made their homes on the island over the years - Nigel Mansell, Sir Norman Wisdom, Jeremy Clarkson. But in the main it’s the salaries of accountants, lawyers and other facilitators of wealth who have bumped up GDP, says Craine, rather than the super-rich themselves: “We’re not so bothered if they come in person, we want them to put their wealth here.” In 2003, Craine returned to the island. He’d been away for almost three decades. After university he’d trained as an accountant with Peat Marwick (which later merged into KPMG) but quickly tired of it. Then he’d taken a job in London with Christian Aid, where his skills were useful in development work. When a post working for the charity on the Isle of Man opened up, he decided it was time to return home. But quickly he felt troubled by what he saw all around him. His charity had been campaigning against developing country elites moving their money to offshore banks. When he’d get off the plane at Ronaldsway, the first thing he’d see would be adverts for “wealth solutions” and “payroll management”. It unsettled him that the Manx model was, in his opinion, denying other countries revenues that could be spent on hospitals and schools. “I don’t deny the great material benefit that that’s brought to the island, it’s just that it carries ethical problems with it,” he says. Craine became convenor of a group called Taxwatch, whose members meet at each other’s homes to discuss concerns about the Manx financial system. Sometimes they write letters to local papers. When he’s asked how his campaigning against the island’s entire business model goes down with its wider population, Craine pauses. “It’s not well received,” he says eventually. “But it’s not going to be, is it? There’s opposition. People will sometimes say that I’m exaggerating or I haven’t got a full grasp of the facts.” He adds: “I’m never going to earn Brownie points by banging on about this.” It’s a small island. Everyone knows everyone else’s business. And when you’re trying to change things, that can be a problem. As you turn left at the east end of Athol Street and walk up a hill, you soon see a gleaming building that resembles a three-tiered wedding cake. Once it was the Bank of Mona, but after it folded in 1878 it was purchased by the Isle of Man government. Today it houses the House of Keys and the Legislative Council, the lower and upper chambers of the Tynwald, which has a disputed claim to be the world’s oldest continuous parliament. When Peter Karran decided at the age of 15 he wanted to sit on the Keys’Westminster-like green wooden benches, people told him not to be daft. A dyslexic labourer’s son, he wanted to see an end to capital punishment and birching (neither of which were abolished on the island until 1993) and improve social mobility for working-class young people like himself, a joiner by trade. Peter Karran “You could either moan in a pub bar or try and do something about it,” he says. In 1985, at the age of 24, he was elected to the House of Keys. After 31 years as an MHK - including a brief spell as a minister - he stood down in 2016. He isn’t nostalgic about the institution. “Very few members weren’t part of the club, or didn’t become part of the club,” he says, referring to what he sees as the cosy atmosphere in the Tynwald. Part of the problem, he says, is that there is no formal opposition - most candidates are elected as independents, rather than as representatives of a political party (Karran was first elected as a member of the Manx Labour Party before forming the Liberal Vannin Party in 2006). The political system has, however, been praised as good for industry. “Businesses say that government officials are accessible and regulations stable,” the Economist wrote in a 2015 profile of the island. The government makes a virtue of this predictability, even boringness, when attracting investment. “We have had the same government for 600 years and there are no surprises,” Jonathan Mills, director of e-business at the Manx department of economic development, told the German broadcaster NDR. “There is no issue around the court system, there is no issue around corruption.” For Craine, the more significant factor that keeps the Manx economic model in place is apathy. “There are many people working in the offshore industries who are working there as a clerk or indeed as a manager who need that monthly salary to pay the mortgage, to put bread and jam on the table at the end of the month for their family,” he says. “I can’t criticise him or her for doing that but the system is geared so that we are as a society knowingly facilitating tax avoidance. And that’s what troubles me.” Perched above Douglas’s promenade is an estate of grand Edwardian villas known as Little Switzerland. The name long predates the island’s finance boom, but today it feels more appropriate than ever. Drive to the western coast of the island and, against the backdrop of the Irish Sea, you’ll see the occasionaltholtan- the Manx word for an abandoned house, a reminder of the hardship and emigration that characterised so much of the island’s past. Some on the island worry those days could return. Brexit has increased uncertainty, and since the 2008 crash, there has been ever greater scrutiny of offshore finance. In that year the UK’s then-Chancellor of the Exchequer Alistair Darling accused the island of being a “tax haven sitting in the Irish Sea”. Karran, for one, says the Manx government hasn’t done enough to protect the island’s public services from the risk of future economic shocks. “Our next generation should be fiscally secure,” he says. It’s not the banks he blames but the politicians, whom he accuses of “willful neglect”. The government rejects warnings from critics who say the economy needs to diversify. The government also strongly rejects the “tax haven” label. “We're not, you know, a brass plaque in the middle of the Irish sea,” Howard Quayle, the island’s chief minister, told Panorama. “We take our international responsibilities exceedingly seriously.” Quayle also points out that the OECD rates the island “compliant” in terms of transparency standards and that when in 2015 the EU published a list of tax havens, the Isle of Man was not on it. In 2013 the then Prime Minister David Cameron said it was no longer fair to describe any Crown Dependency as a tax haven. The revelations in the Paradise Papers will focus international scrutiny on the way the Isle of Man does business. For now, those like Phil Craine who want to change dramatically the island’s attitude to finance remain in a minority. He accepts the changes he would like to see would hurt. “I don’t know what’s going to come next. But I do know I’m not happy with the current model.” Craine is hopeful that, whatever happens, the Manx economy will end up, as ever, standing on one of its three legs.

A bit more on the revelation from the Paradise Papers that Prince Charles campaigned to alter climate-change agreements without disclosing his private estate had an offshore financial interest in what he was promoting. On Tuesday, a spokesman for the Prince denied that Charles had spoken out
on the climate-change deals in order to benefit financially. ""The Prince has never chosen to speak out on a topic simply because of a
company that The Duchy may have invested in,"" he said.
 ""In the case of climate change his views are well-known, indeed he has been
warning of the threat of global warming to our environment for over 30 years."" The spokesman added that carbon markets were just one of many strategies
Charles had championed since the 1990s to try and slow the pace of climate change. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Retract Iran remark, husband tells Johnson","This video can not be played Mr Ratcliffe maintains his wife is innocent The husband of a British-Iranian woman, in prison in Iran, has urged Boris Johnson to retract his remark that she had been training journalists in Iran. Richard Ratcliffe said Iranian officials were using the foreign secretary's statement to justify extending his wife Nazanin's jail term. Mr Johnson has called his Iranian counterpart to clarify the situation. Liam Fox said his cabinet colleague's comment was a ""slip of the tongue"" but Labour said it was ""unacceptable"". Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe is serving a five-year sentence for allegedly plotting to topple the government in Tehran, although the official charges were never made public. Mr Ratcliffe maintains his wife's innocence, saying she was in Iran visiting family when she was arrested in 2016. She was summoned to court on Saturday where Mr Johnson's comment was cited as new evidence as to what she was doing in Iran. The Foreign Office said Mr Johnson now accepted he ""could have been clearer"" with his comments to the Foreign Affairs Committee. In a phone call to Iranian foreign minister Javad Zarif, Mr Johnson said that his remarks provided ""no justifiable basis"" for further legal action and he intended to visit Iran before the end of the year to discuss the case. Mr Zarif told the foreign secretary that the developments in the case over the weekend ""were unrelated"" to Mr Johnson's remarks, a Foreign Office statement added. Fears after Boris Johnson remark She was 'punished without a crime' Husband's plea for Briton held in Iran International Trade Secretary Liam Fox told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""We all make slips of the tongue"", adding on Sky News that it wasn't ""a serious gaffe"". But Labour's Tulip Siddiq, Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's MP, said it was ""unacceptable"" for Mr Johnson to ""lack a basic grasp on this important situation"". ""A slip of the tongue in my books is swearing in front of your child by mistake - it's not condemning a British citizen to an extra five years in prison,"" she said. Mr Ratcliffe told the BBC's Today programme that Mr Johnson should make a statement in the Commons, retracting what he said. He added the ""worst thing"" Mr Johnson could do now was ""suddenly go quiet and to create this problem without making any clarifications"". He said he still hoped his wife and young daughter would be back home in the UK for Christmas. This video can not be played Liam Fox tells BBC's Today that Boris Johnson's comment about Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was a ""slip of the tongue"" Former Conservative foreign secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind told the BBC Mr Johnson needed ""to concentrate more"" and ""get the detail right"". Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was sentenced to jail following a court hearing into whether she was attempting to overthrow the government. She denies all the allegations against her, but lost her final appeal in April. She has since faced two more charges relating to an accusation of plotting to topple the regime in Tehran. Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe has worked for the Thomson Reuters Foundation and the BBC, but insisted the 2016 visit was for her daughter to meet her grandparents. However, appearing before MPs on the House of Commons Foreign Affairs Select Committee last week, Mr Johnson appeared to contradict that. He criticised Iran over the case before saying: ""When I look at what Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe was doing, she was simply teaching people journalism, as I understand it. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe is serving a five-year sentence in Iran ""[Neither] Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe nor her family has been informed about what crime she has actually committed. And that I find extraordinary, incredible."" Four days later, Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was summoned to court where the foreign secretary's comments were cited as fresh evidence against her. At the hearing, she was accused of engaging in ""propaganda against the regime"". The Iranian judiciary's High Council for Human Rights said Mr Johnson's comments ""shed new light"" on the charity worker and proved Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe ""had visited the country for anything but a holiday"". Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe had been eligible for parole under the early release scheme from 23 November. However, Mr Ratcliffe told the Press Association that she could now face a fresh trial before that date to block her chance of freedom. ""I think the one thing the foreign secretary could do to make amends would be if he went to visit her in the next few weeks before her trial,"" he said.

Johnson: Iran remarks 'could be clearer',"This video can not be played Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe's husband said ""she was just a mum on holiday"" Boris Johnson has said he is sorry if his remarks about a British-Iranian mother caused anxiety to her family. The foreign secretary had been criticised for saying Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who has been jailed in Iran, had been training journalists there. A charity said the remarks could worsen her sentence. She had been in Iran on holiday when she was arrested, it said. Mr Johnson told MPs he was sorry if his words were ""so taken out of context"" as ""to cause any kind of anxiety"". The UK government had ""no doubt"" she was on holiday when she was arrested, he said. This video can not be played Mr Johnson called the Iranian foreign minister, Javad Zarif, about Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's case Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was detained at Tehran Airport in April 2016 and is serving a five-year sentence for allegedly plotting to topple the government in Tehran, although the official charges have never been made public. She has worked for the Thomson Reuters Foundation and BBC Media Action (the corporation's international development charity), but has always said the 2016 visit was so her daughter Gabriella, who is three, could meet her grandparents. She was summoned back to court on 4 November, where Mr Johnson's comment was cited as new evidence as to what she was doing in Iran. Mr Johnson had told the Commons Foreign Affairs Select Committee on 1 November: ""When I look at what Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe was doing, she was simply teaching people journalism, as I understand it. ""[Neither] Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe nor her family has been informed about what crime she has actually committed. And that I find extraordinary, incredible."" Fears after Boris Johnson remark She was 'punished without a crime' Husband's plea for Briton held in Iran Her husband, Richard Ratcliffe, said Mr Johnson had done a ""good thing"" in clarifying his comments, and asked him to try to visit his wife in Iran. ""It's important that the judiciary understands that the British government thinks she is innocent,"" he  said. He said he hoped his wife and daughter, a British citizen - who is with her grandparents in Iran - can return home before Christmas. Monique Villa, chief executive of the Thomson Reuters Foundation, said she saw a ""direct correlation"" between Mr Johnson's original remarks and Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's treatment in Iran. She said Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe had ""never trained journalists"" at the charity. This video can not be played Boris Johnson is asked if he will apologise to Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe's family Mr Johnson told MPs his previous remarks to the foreign affairs committee ""could have been clearer"". He said: ""My point was that I disagreed with the Iranian view that training journalists was a crime - not that I wanted to lend any credence to Iranian allegations that Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe has been engaged in such activity. ""I accept that my remarks could have been clearer in that respect, and I'm glad to provide this clarification."" Later, when MP Layla Moran asked him if he would apologise to Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's family, he said: ""Of course I am sorry if any words of mine have been so taken out of context and so misconstrued as to cause any kind of anxiety for the family."" He said he did not believe his comments had ""had any impact on the judicial process"" in Iran. By Ben Wright, BBC political correspondent: Boris Johnson is in hot water again. It will not, however, result in his dismissal from the cabinet. In an effort to hose the situation down and minimise any damage to Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's case, the foreign secretary told his Iranian counterpart that he accepted his remarks at the committee ""could have been clearer"". He said he was seeking to condemn ""the Iranian view that training journalists was a crime."" But that is not what he said to the Commons committee last week - and Labour MPs are furious at this latest diplomatic fumble by the Foreign Secretary. The foreign secretary said his comments had no impact on the case in Iran, a view echoed by his Iranian counterpart. That certainly helps Mr Johnson weather this latest storm. But more fundamentally, Theresa May does not have the political strength to dismiss one of the Cabinet's big Brexit-supporting beasts.

Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe says she was in Iran so her daughter could meet her grandparents By Rana Rahimpour, BBC Persian Service: The case of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe is first and foremost a story of terrible personal suffering for a young woman, her husband and their baby girl. Eighteen months into a five-year sentence, Ms Zaghari-Ratcliffe faces the prospect of up to 16 years in an Iranian jail. It is also, however, a story of an internal power struggle in Iran, as well as of the nation's deeply difficult relationship with the UK.

"'We lost Â£300,000 through payment scam'","This video can not be played Kate Blakeley: 'We lost Â£300,000 through payment scam' People who have been conned into authorising their bank to pay a fraudster could find it easier to get compensation, under plans being put together by the regulator. The Payment Systems Regulator is trying to devise a way to reimburse victims of authorised push payment (APP) scams. In the first half of this year, 19,000 victims lost Â£100m to APP scams. One such, Kate Blakeley, described the ""sheer horror"" of discovering the loss of almost Â£300,000 through such a scam. Ms Blakeley, who was in the process of buying a house with her partner, described her experience. She thought she was transferring money to the right account, but it was in fact one controlled by a fraudster. ""Everything had gone very smoothly,"" she said. ""Our conveyancing solicitor provided details by email of the bank accounts to make the money transfers on the day of completion. ""We transferred just under Â£300,000 on the day and within about three hours, we realised the money had gone missing. ""The moment of realising the money hadn't arrived as intended with the bank account we sent it to, or thought we'd sent it to, was just sheer horror."" Ms Blakeley did get all the money back eventually, but lost thousands in solicitors' fees. The matter is still subject to a legal dispute. The PSR has been investigating APP scams following a super-complaint by consumer body Which?. The regulator said ""good progress"" was being made in a number of areas and it hoped a compensation system would be in place by September 2018. As well as starting to record and understand the scale of APP scams, the PSR will also introduce new standards for banks to follow when a victim reports such a scam, which should improve victims' experience and banks' response times. However, PSR managing director Hannah Nixon warned that not every scam could be prevented. ""There is no silver bullet for APP scams, and some people will still, unfortunately, lose out,"" she said. ""That's why we've continued to look for a solution that could reimburse those who are scammed, and today we begin consulting on an option that we think could work."" She added that account holders also needed to take ""an appropriate level of care"" in protecting themselves. When you transfer money from your bank account, you are asked to enter three pieces of information:  the name of the payee, their account number, and the sort code. However, only the last two are cross-checked by the bank. So putting in the correct name is no guarantee that person will get the money. Financial Fraud Action UK offers the following advice: Never disclose security details, such as your PIN or full banking password Don't assume an email, text or phone call is authentic Don't be rushed - a genuine organisation won't mind waiting Listen to your instincts - you know if something doesn't feel right Stay in control - don't panic and make a decision you'll regret The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has reviewed the way banks handle APP scams. It found banks' procedures were inconsistent, their existing fraud detection systems could not easily detect APP scams, and they did not collect enough data. However, the FCA considers the industry initiatives underway will help to tackle these issues. Peter Vicary-Smith, chief executive of Which?, said: ""It's good to see the regulator coming down on the side of consumers. If this stops the huge amounts of money lost to bank transfer scams, it'll be a significant win. ""To make this a reality, the regulator must now ensure any reimbursement scheme properly compensates victims. Meanwhile, banks must move to quickly put in place better checks and protections to prevent these scams happening in the first place.""

Fossil of 'our earliest ancestors' revealed,"The mammals ventured out at night to hunt insects Fossils of the oldest-known ancestors of most living mammals, including human beings, have been unearthed in southern England. Teeth belonging to the extinct shrew-like creatures, which scampered at the feet of dinosaurs, were discovered in cliffs on the Dorset coast. Scientists who identified the specimens say they are the earliest undisputed fossils of mammals belonging to the line that led to humans. They date back 145 million years. ''Here we have discovered from the Jurassic coast a couple of shrew-like things that are to date unequivocally our earliest ancestors,'' said Dr Steve Sweetman of Portsmouth University, who examined the ancient teeth. The mammals were tiny, furry creatures that probably emerged under the cover of night. One, a possible burrower, dined on insects, while the larger may have eaten plants as well. Their teeth were highly advanced, of a type that can pierce, cut and crush food. ''They are also very worn which suggests the animals to which they belonged lived to a good age for their species,'' said Dr Sweetman. ''No mean feat when you're sharing your habitat with predatory dinosaurs."" The fossils were discovered by Grant Smith, then an undergraduate student. He was sifting through rock samples collected at Durlston Bay near Swanage for his dissertation when he found teeth of a type never before seen in rocks of this age. Researchers from the University of Portsmouth made the discovery ''The Jurassic Coast is always unveiling fresh secrets and I'd like to think that similar discoveries will continue to be made right on our doorstep,"" said Prof Dave Martill of Portsmouth University, who supervised the project. One of the new species has been namedDurlstotherium newmaniafter Charlie Newman, who is the landlord of a pub close to where the fossils were discovered, and is also a keen fossil collector. The second has been namedDulstodon ensomi, after Paul Ensom, a local palaeontologist. The findings, published in the Journal,Acta Palaeontologica Polonica, add new evidence to a hotly-debated field. Recent fossil discoveries from China pushed back the date of the earliest mammals to 160 million years ago. However, this has been disputed, based on data from molecular studies. A separate study revealed this week suggests that the earliest mammals were night creatures that only switched to daytime living after the demise of the dinosaurs. The research, published in the journal,Nature Ecology and Evolution, could explain why many mammals living today are nocturnal. Follow Helen onTwitter,external.

Two boys die after car hits Sydney classroom,"Police investigate the crash in the Sydney suburb of Greenacre Two eight-year-old boys have died after a car crashed into a primary school classroom in Sydney, police have said. The incident at Banksia Road Public School also left three girls in hospital with injuries. Most of the other 19 children in the classroom were assessed at the scene by paramedics, authorities said. The driver of the car, a 52-year-old woman, was taken to a police station. Authorities say they do not believe the crash was intentional. The incident happened at about 09:45 local time on Tuesday (22:45 GMT Monday) in the suburb of Greenacre. Paramedics described the scene as ""pandemonium"". ""Obviously it was a scene of carnage,"" said Supt Stephanie Radnidge, from New South Wales (NSW) Ambulance. ""There were a number of distressed and overwhelmed children and teachers at the scene of a horrible accident."" The two boys were taken to a nearby hospital, where they died from their injuries. A girl, nine, remains in a serious condition, while the two others, both eight, were stable, authorities said. Police said ""a number"" of other children received minor injuries and were treated at the scene. Authorities described the scene as deeply distressing ""It is very, very hard because we are parents ourselves, we are human beings,"" said Supt Radnidge. ""But we are highly trained and the best care was delivered this morning to those injured at this site."" Police said the driver was undergoing mandatory blood and urine tests, and they were investigating how the crash happened. ""We do not believe this was an intentional act,"" said NSW Police Commander Stuart Smith. It is not yet known if the woman had any connection with the school, authorities said. One man at the scene, Khaled Arnaout, said he saw a ""big hole"" in the wall of the portable classroom after being drawn to it by screams. ""Teachers and everyone were just running around,"" he told theSydney Morning Herald,external. ""There was blood and kids on the floor, just lying down and screaming.""

May plans new code after Patel apology,"Priti Patel must be investigated for holding unofficial meetings during a holiday in Israel or ""do the decent thing and resign"", Labour has said. The international development secretary apologised on Tuesday for holding 12 meetings, including one with Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu, on a private trip. In the Commons, Labour's Kate Osamor said it was a ""black and white case"" of the ministerial code being broken. But minister Alistair Burt said policy did not change as a result of the trip. Ms Patel was not in the Commons to face an urgent question about her actions because she is on a pre-arranged visit to Africa, a situation which Labour said was ""simply not acceptable"". The BBC understands Ms Patel suggested some of Britain's aid budget go to the Israeli army, after the visit in August. She asked her officials to see if Britain could support humanitarian operations conducted by the Israeli army in the occupied Golan Heights area. Kuenssberg: A bad day at the office for Theresa May The BBC understands the Foreign Office advised that because Britain did not officially recognise Israel's annexation of the area, it would be hard for the Department for International Development to work there. Speaking in the Commons, Foreign Office minister Alistair Burt defended Ms Patel's ""perfectly legitimate"" right to raise the matter - saying it was within the context of providing medical help for Syrian refugees who could not get assistance in their own country. But he said the idea had been rejected because ministers did not think it would be ""appropriate"". He told MPs that the Foreign Office learned of her visit on 24 August, while she was still in Israel, but after a number of key meetings had already taken place. He said Ms Patel had been ""absolutely contrite"" for ""getting the sequencing wrong"" in terms of informing officials but Mrs May accepted her apology and now regarded the matter ""as closed"". But Labour's Kate Osamor said Ms Patel's actions were covered by the existing code and demanded a probe into what she did during the trip and what action she sought upon her return. The opposition says there are ""strong grounds"" to believe Ms Patel is responsible for ""multiple breaches"" include failing to act in an open and transparent manner, not abiding by the principle of collective responsibility and not being honest about the nature and number of meetings she attended. ""It is hard to think of a more black and white case of breaking the ministerial code,"" Ms Osamor said. ""It is time the secretary of state either faces a Cabinet Office investigation or does the decent thing and just resigns"". The BBC's diplomatic correspondent James Landale said local UK diplomats in Israel probably first became aware of her visit on 24 August because that was when the opposition leader she met, Yair Lapid, first tweeted about their meeting.

The BBC revealed on Friday that Ms Patel held a number of undisclosed meetings with business and political figures, including Mr Lapid, the leader of Israel's centrist Yesh Atid party. No diplomats were present at the meetings, at which the minister was accompanied by an influential pro-Israeli Conservative peer and campaigner, Lord Polak. Ms Patel has admitted how the meetings were set up ""did not accord with the usual procedures"". Former Conservative foreign secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that it was ""extremely unwise"" for Ms Patel to have held secret meetings with Israeli officials. Ms Patel discussed Benjamin Netanyahu's visit to the UK, which took place last week ""Not only did she not tell the Foreign Office directly, so far as I'm aware the British Embassy in Israel wasn't aware that this was happening. Now that just shouldn't be done... it's not just a question of courtesy,"" he said. Lord Ricketts, former head of the diplomatic service, told BBC Radio 4's World Tonight that he couldn't think of a precedent ""where a senior minister visits a country, has an extensive programme like this without the Foreign Office, the foreign secretary or even the ambassador in the country knowing about it"". However International Trade Secretary Liam Fox told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that it was not ""in any way forbidden"" to speak to the prime minister of another country without telling the foreign secretary. He added: ""I find it utterly unsurprising that the international aid secretary would want to talk to charities while she's on holiday in a particular area about whether or not we can use the British aid budget to diminish the humanitarian problems there."" Ms Patel, who is a long-standing supporter of Israel and a former vice-chairman of Conservative Friends of Israel, has admitted a ""lack of precision"" for suggesting last week that Boris Johnson knew about the trip, and that only two meetings had taken place when she attended 12. Downing Street, which has called for the ministerial code to be clarified in this area, said Ms Patel had acknowledged she had behaved in an ""improper way"" and would not do so again.

Saudis accuse Iran of 'direct aggression'Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman says Iran supplied a missile fired at Riyadh by Yemeni rebels.1h42 minutes agoMiddle East,"This video can not be played A Yemeni TV station released footage of what it claimed was a Riyadh-bound missile Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has accused Iran of an act of ""direct military aggression"" by supplying missiles to rebels in Yemen. This ""may be considered an act of war"", state media quoted the prince as telling UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson in a telephone conversation. On Saturday, a ballistic missile was intercepted near the Saudi capital. Iran denies arming the Houthi movement, which has fought a Saudi-led coalition backing Yemen's government since 2015. Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said the prince's claim was ""dangerous"". Riyadh's night of long knives and long-range missiles Witnessing Yemen's desperate suffering Yemen conflict: Who is fighting whom? Houthi-aligned media reported that the rebels had fired a Burkan H2 ballistic missile,externalat King Khaled International Airport, which is 850km (530 miles) from the Yemeni border and 11km north-east of Riyadh. Saudi missile defences intercepted the missile in flight, but some fragments fell inside the airport area. Human Rights Watch said the launch of an indiscriminate missile at a predominantly civilian airportwas an apparent war crime,external. The Houthi movement unveiled the Burkan 2 missile in February 2017 The official Saudi Press Agency reported on Tuesday that in his telephone call with Prince Mohammed,Mr Johnson had ""expressed his condemnation of launching a ballistic missile by Houthi coup militias"",external. ""For his part, the crown prince stressed that the involvement of the Iranian regime in supplying its Houthi militias with missiles is considered a direct military aggression by the Iranian regime and may be considered an act of war against the kingdom,"" it added. Mr Zarif condemned Saudi Arabia's ""provocative actions"" in a telephone call with Mr Johnson later on Tuesday, foreign ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi said. ""He dismissed false and dangerous claims made by Saudi officials, and said they are against international law and the UN Charter,"" Mr Qassemi added. By Jonathan Marcus, BBC diplomatic correspondent Iran and Saudi Arabia are engaged in a regional ""Cold War""; a battle for influence and power. And just like the US-Soviet Cold War, while the two main protagonists are not directly involved in fighting each other, they or their proxies are engaged on a number of other battlefields. The Saudis went into Yemen to counter alleged Iranian influence, but the campaign has proved a quagmire for the Saudi forces. Iran is in the ascendant in Iraq, where it is a close ally of the Shia-dominated government. And it is ""winning"" in Syria too, helping to stabilise and consolidate the Assad regime. Saudi support for Syrian rebel factions has achieved nothing. Now the Saudis seem to be focusing on another country where Iran's allies - in this case, Hezbollah - are well entrenched - Lebanon. But tinkering with that country's fragile stability has huge risks - not least the danger of prompting a crisis that could lead to a full-scale war between Israel and Hezbollah. On Monday, Saudi Foreign MinisterAdel al-Jubeir told CNN that members of Lebanon's Hezbollah movement, an Iranian proxy, launched the missile.,external He said the missile was similar to one launched in July that was shot down close to the Saudi city of Mecca, and that it was manufactured in Iran, disassembled and smuggled into Yemen, then reassembled by ""operatives from the Iranian Revolutionary Guards and Hezbollah"". The US permanent representative to the UN,Nikki Haley, said the missile fired in July was an ""Iranian Qaim"",external, which she described as a ""type of weapon that had not been present in Yemen before the conflict"". The missile shot down on Saturday ""may also be of Iranian origin"", she added. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Ms Haley warned that by providing such weapons to the Houthis, the Revolutionary Guards were violating two UN Security Council resolutions. Iran's foreign ministry has said the missile launch was ""an independent action"" by the Houthis in response to Saudi-led coalition ""aggression"". In response to the attack, the coalition announced the ""temporary"" closure of all Yemeni land, sea and air ports,external, tightening an existing blockade, but said humanitarian aid could continue to enter Yemen under strict vetting procedures. Houthi-aligned media reported that the rebels had fired the ballistic missile The United Nations said on Tuesday that all humanitarian flights to Yemen had been grounded and called on the coalition to re-open Yemen's borders. ""The situation is catastrophic in Yemen,"" Jens Laerke, a spokesman for the Office for the Co-ordination for Humanitarian Affairs, told reporters. More than 8,670 people - 60% of them civilians - have been killed,externaland 49,960 injured in air strikes and fighting on the ground since the coalition intervened in Yemen's civil war in March 2015, according to the UN. The conflict has also left 20.7 million people in need of humanitarian assistance, created the world's largest food security emergency, and led to a cholera outbreak that is believed to have affected 902,000 people and caused 2,191 deaths.

"Endangered apes saved from pet tradeRescued pet apes in Indonesia are being returned to the wild, but traders are still ""flouting the law"".10h10 hours agoScience & Environment","This video can not be played The arrival of the new baby gibbon provides hope for the future of this endangered species Conservationists are celebrating the arrival of a baby Javan gibbon - the first of this species to be born in the wild to parents that were rescued from the pet trade. Conservation International says the birth is a boost for the future of the apes on the Indonesian island of Java. But illegal trade is still a threat, and is increasingly moving online. A UK-based investigation this year,externalrevealed that the law protecting these ape species was being openly ""flouted"". Researchers who carried out the investigation, who are based at Oxford Brookes University, also showed BBC News videos of protected species being advertised by pet traders on social media platforms. The birth of the wild-born Javan gibbon - in a protected forest in West Java - is a breakthrough for a project that has now released 17 of the apes into the area. Conservation International (CI) and the Javan Gibbon Foundation have rehabilitated the animals, and rangers now patrol the site at Mount Malabar daily, monitoring the animals and checking for any poaching activity. It has taken almost 10 years to bring the two adults back to the forest. ""It's a long, long process,"" explained Anton Ario from CI. ""Because the poachers that take gibbons for the trade target the babies - because they're cute and easy to sell - when we find them, they're often living in a cage and cannot move around at all. They need to learn to live in the trees."" To ensure their rereleased animals are able to survive, they introduce them to potential mates while they are still in captivity - ultimately releasing pairs or family groups of the animals. The new birth represents hope for a primate that is rapidly losing its habitat in Java, which has less than 5% of pristine forest left in its steep, tropical mountains. But while programmes like this can get a few animals back to the wild every year, many more are being bought and sold as pets. Young orangutans are targeted by the illegal pet trade A search on social media channels will reveal pet shops and sellers - many based in South East Asia - openly advertising pet baby gibbons for sale. ""They are flouting the law,"" says Prof Vincent Nijman, from Oxford Brookes University, who has carried out investigations of the illegal trade in endangered apes. Researchers monitoring the trade showed us pictures and videos of gibbons being advertised for sale on social media platforms, including Facebook and Instagram ""No-one is being punished. ""So if people [entering the forest] come across a baby gibbon and have the option to capture it, they are motivated to do it. It represents money and doesn't represent any risk."" The trade is not confined to gibbons. Critically endangered orangutans and slow lorises are also being ""plucked"" from the wild. Prof Nijman's recently published investigation revealed that, while more than 400 illegal pet orangutans had been seized by law enforcement in Indonesia in the last two decades, those confiscations had led to only seven prosecutions. Rescued apes have to be rehabilitated by conservationists, who help them learn to return to the trees after life in a cage BBC News reported a post to Facebook that advertised a baby gibbon for sale. In response, the company said it had removed the post and was ""investigating the page where it was posted"". ""We're committed to helping tackle the illegal online trade of protected wildlife and will remove any content that violates our community standards when it is reported to us,"" Facebook said in a statement. Instagram has also responded after the BBC alerted it to the sale of gibbons on the site. In a statement sent to BBC News, the company said that the accounts in question had been removed, adding that the illegal trade or sale of animals was ""prohibited on Instagram"". Prof Nijman pointed out that the numerous threats to endangered apes in Indonesia were not all problems that people had the power to tackle. ""Orangutans in particular face threats left, right and centre,"" he said, ""But curbing the pet trade is within our control. ""It's in human hands to fix this.""

The event that sparked 100 angry years," He is staring at me. I feel it. ­­­ His pale blue eyes are cold and penetrating. But it is his expressionless face that is most unnerving - a face disfigured by bayonets.  Daylight seeps through holes that have been gouged into his cheeks and forehead. This portrait of the Russian Emperor Alexander II transfixes me. The Austrian artist Heinrich von Angeli painted it in 1876. Russian revolutionaries ran their bayonets through it in 1917 when they seized the Winter Palace in Petrograd - as St Petersburg was then known - a sign of their hatred for the old Russia they were sweeping away. Ever since, the painting has been hidden in the vaults of the State Hermitage Museum housed in the Winter Palace. For the 100th anniversary of the revolution, the damaged portrait is being displayed in Russia for the first time. I am given a private viewing. It is only a painting - just oil and canvas. But the pockmarked face of Emperor Alexander conveys the drama and the brutality of Russia’s revolution more powerfully than anything I have seen. There were, in fact, two revolutions in 1917. TheFebruary Revolutiondeposed the monarchy. The imperial Winter Palace became the seat of the Provisional Government. The second revolution imposed Bolshevism on Russia, creating the world’s first communist state. The Great October Socialist Revolution – as it became known – actually took place on 7 November. But in 1917 Russia was using a different calendar from the West, according to which the date was 25 October. Soviet propaganda would portray what happened as a mass uprising of workers, peasants and soldiers who – led by the Bolsheviks – stormed the Winter Palace to seize power for the people. That was the picture dutifully painted by Soviet cinema. A decade later, film-maker Sergei Eisenstein re-enacted the revolution for his epic entitled October. Filmed on location at the Winter Palace, it depicted Red October as Russia’s Bastille moment, with thousands of people breaking down the gates of the palace and pouring inside. The cruiser Aurora was accorded a starring role - firing the shot that signalled the start of the uprising. The Aurora It was a magnificent spectacle. But it wasn’t true. The Winter Palace is widely believed to have suffered more damage from Eisenstein’s film crew than from the actual revolution. In 1917 there was no dramatic storming of the Winter Palace. Most of the Red Guard revolutionaries who had got inside did so through an unlocked door. As for claims of a mass uprising, this was fake news from the Bolsheviks. Red October was a coup. Vladimir Lenin’s party had seized power in Russia. Its slogans, though, were attractive to people trapped in poverty: “Land to the peasants! Factories to the workers!” American journalist John Reed witnessed the Bolshevik takeover of Russia. In his bookTen Days That Shook the Worldhe described the chaos before the coup. “The peasants… were burning manor houses and massacring landowners. Immense strikes and lock-outs convulsed Moscow, Odessa, and the coal mines of the Don. Transport was paralysed; the army was starving, and in the big cities there was no bread.” But the revolution plunged Russia into the bloodiest period of its history. Civil war, world war, famine and Joseph Stalin’s Great Terror would claim tens of millions of lives. “It is our historical fate,” Hermitage director Mikhail Piotrovsky tells me of his country. “We make experiments. We show how things shouldn’t be done. Just having a good goal or a good idea doesn’t mean the results will be good. We gave a lesson to the world.” The Bolsheviks wanted to do more than just teach the world. They wanted to change it. They believed their coup would set the dominoes tumbling and spark a global uprising of workers. “Proletarians of the world, unite!” was the rallying cry of communism. The new world was to look very different. Portraits of tsars gave way toposters of factory workers. Newborn babies were given revolutionary first names, like “Barricade”, “Kim” (short for “Communist International of Youth”) and “Ninel” (“Lenin” backwards). The new world would sound different, too. The Russian inventor, Leon Theremin In a tiny St Petersburg art studio, Petr Theremin demonstrates the exotic instrument his great-grandfather Leon invented soon after the revolution. Without touching it, Petr is producing haunting tones, simply by moving his hands up and down near two antennae. Invisible electromagnetic waves conjure upa sound reminiscent of a lilting voice or violin. The theremin was one of the world’s first electronic instruments. The Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin was captivated by it. He enlisted the machine and its maker in his campaign to spread electricity across Russia. Lenin gave Theremin a free pass for the railways, so the inventor could display his masterpiece - and promote electrification – across the country. Once the Bolshevik leader requested a private demonstration in the Kremlin. “Lenin decided to try out the instrument himself,” Petr tells me. “My great-grandfather took Lenin’s hand and moved it around the theremin. He helped him play The Lark by Glinka. There was a joke at the time that Leon Theremin was the only man in the world who could control Lenin.” By the time Stalin was running the USSR, there was little to joke about.  Lenin’s successor was a paranoid dictator, who unleashed a wave of terror against his own people. In 1939, after returning from a trip to America, Leon Theremin was arrested, accused of being a counter-revolutionary and sent to a labour camp. We needed democracy. What we got was a catastrophe.” Millions of people were arrested in Stalin’s purges and repressions. Hundreds of thousands of innocent Soviet citizens were shot. Leon Theremin survived the gulag. While still a prisoner, he was transferred to a secret research laboratory in Moscow to work with other top scientists plucked from the labour camps. “There were, of course, some positive results from the revolution,” concedes Petr. “Like the spread of literacy and electrification. But the seizure of power by the Bolsheviks was a tragedy for the country. We needed democracy. What we got was a catastrophe.” In St Petersburg a century on there are few banners or advertising hoardings celebrating the anniversary of Red October, and there are no official commemorations on the scale, or style, of a French Bastille Day. For if modern France still identifies with the ideals of its revolution – “liberty, equality, fraternity” - modern Russia, particularly its government, is hesitant about 1917. Like Russia’s national symbol - the double-headed eagle - the Russian authorities are torn two ways over the events of 1917. On the one hand, Red October gave birth to the Soviet Union, a superpower President Putin has often praised. The Kremlin leader once described the collapse of the USSR as “the greatest geo-political catastrophe” of the 20th Century. Yet an armed uprising against the government is not the kind of example the Kremlin wishes to promote - especially in the light of Russia’s economic problems. “The attitude of the authorities to the Russian Revolution is radio silence,” says historian Sergei Podbolotov. “One of the revolution’s main ideas – the abolition of private property - is totally alien to the current regime. So is the idea of taking up arms and attacking police.” But the revolutionary cocktail of a century ago - food shortages, an unpopular war and widespread disillusionment with the government – does not exist today. Despite Western sanctions against Russia, the supermarket shelves of St Petersburg are well-stocked. The coffee shops and trendy bars of Nevsky Prospekt are packed with young Russians chatting on smartphones or glued to their tablets. Many of these people were born after 1991, the year communism collapsed and the Soviet Union crumbled. Nevsky Prospekt Bathed in the sunlight of a late Russian autumn, the “Venice of the North” looks like an oasis of calm. But political discontent still stirs. In a St Petersburg park, named after Mars, the Roman god of war, hundreds of people have gathered foran anti-government protest. Many are supporters of opposition leader and Kremlin criticAlexei Navalny, who wants to run for president next March. But convictions for fraud, which Navalny claims are politically motivated, bar him from the ballot. The suspicion that the Kremlin is not playing fair has brought people out on the streets. “I want to live in a Russia that is fair to all its citizens,” one of the protesters, Olga, tells me. “And I want a leader who listens to his people. Vladimir Putin doesn’t.” “Personally, I don’t think that Navalny would be a good president,” another protester tells me. “But I believe elections should be democratic – not what we have now.” No-one here is calling for a 21st Century Russian revolution. “Revolution means blood and deaths,” Katya tells me. “We want honest elections, not revolution.” The authorities are taking no chances. There is a heavy police presence. Through loudhailers, police are asking the crowd to disperse, declaring this an unsanctioned gathering. The protesters believe they do not require permission to express an opinion. Some of the protesters decide to march off through the city centre. It is Vladimir Putin’s birthday. The crowd is about to spoil the president’s party. “Putin is a thief!” they chant. “Russia without Putin!” “Send the tsar to the labour camp!” Riot police with truncheons line up across the road. Minutes later, they start dragging people from the crowd. Police buses quickly fill up with detained protesters. At night a few dozen protesters appear outside the Winter Palace. They hold up signs with Alexei Navalny’s name and chant sarcastically “Happy birthday!” to the president. Their protest is a faint echo of those 1917 revolutionaries who seized the palace and dug holes in Emperor Alexander’s portrait. Yet these young people are not here to make a revolution. They are making a point - that the government should listen to the people. The Russian authorities often brush off protesters as a tiny minority. But with real incomes falling and 20 million Russians living below the poverty line, any signs of dissent make the Kremlin nervous. I see the ghosts of communism past. Philosopher Karl Marx is here. He looks deep in thought. Dictator Joseph Stalin is here, too. He looks sinister. Once communist idols, these giants of history – or rather their statues – have been put out to grass in a park near Moscow. Here, too, stands the leader of the Russian Revolution,Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov, known to the world as Lenin. Indeed, there are lots of Lenins here. In one pose, he is the great thinker, with hand on chin. In another, he’s chatting to children. A third statue has Lenin toiling away at his desk. A recent study calculated that there aremore than 14,000 Lenin statues across the former Soviet Union. It used to be that wherever you went in the USSR, you could be certain there was at least one Lenin looking your way. In life, Lenin was a charismatic revolutionary. In death he was transformed into communism’s first personality cult. As well as the statues, his face stared down on Soviet citizens from billboards; his portrait was carried at communist parades; he was praised in songs and poems. The cradle of the Russian Revolution, St Petersburg, was renamed Leningrad in his honour. Lenin taught generations of Soviet children to read. On a trip to the USSR, I once bought a reading book for nine-year-old school kids to practise my Russian. Here is my translation of page 149: “Lenin’s name is in everyone’s heart! “We always remember Lenin,We think of him so dear.We consider that his birthday,Is the best day of the year. “We learn to serve the motherland,Just like Lenin would,To love labour and value friendship,Like only Lenin could.” Accompanying the poem is a picture of two children gazing religiously at Lenin’s portrait. It is one of the ironies of the Russian Revolution that the man who led it, who waged war on the Church and declared all religious ideas “an abomination” ended up the closest thing communism had to a god. At the heart of this cult was Lenin’s final resting place - the macabre mausoleum on Red Square, where his embalmed body was displayed and worshipped like a Soviet saint.A whole scientific institute was created to preserve the corpse. To keep Lenin looking like Lenin, the team of scientists has had to replace some skin and flesh over the years with plastics and other materials. In communist times people would queue for up to six hours to see the body of the ""vozhd"", or ""great leader"". Not today. To many in modern Russia, Lenin is more a museum piece than an object of adoration. Curiosity still draws foreign tourists. But the much shorter queues suggest that Russians have lost interest in him. 1950: The queue to see Lenin's body stretches across Red Square Today there is a new cult in town. True, I have yet to see a statue of Vladimir Putin in Moscow. But the souvenir shops here are full of Putin busts. You can also buy Putin mugs, fridge magnets, T-shirts, smartphone covers, even Putin chocolates. You name it, Putin’s face is currently on it. I have counted at least five different Putin 2018 calendars on sale in the newspaper kiosks. They all feature various pin-up poses of Russia’s action-man president. While Brand Putin sells, Bolshevik Lenin is under fire. And it is the Orthodox Church, increasingly influential in Russia, which is leading the charge against him. “One lesson of the revolution is we should not allow society to be shaken by people coming from abroad with a special task,” Metropolitan Hilarion, head of external relations for the Russian Orthodox Church, tells me. Metropolitan Hilarion of the Russian Orthodox Church: The Bolshevik revolution was a “criminal” act “The Bolshevik revolution started with the arrival of Lenin and more than 200 other revolutionaries who came by train through Germany. Their trip was sponsored by Germany, which was at war with Russia. This indicates the whole affair was criminal.” In other words, with Lenin’s help, a foreign power orchestrated regime change in Russia in 1917. The argument has a contemporary ring to it. In recent years Moscow has accused Western governments of plotting social unrest in Russia. The Russian authorities also link the West to the so-called “coloured revolutions” that have deposed pro-Moscow regimes, from Ukraine to Georgia. Russian officials often refer to Red October as “the first coloured revolution.” So, if Vladimir Lenin is a fallen idol, is it time to remove him from the mausoleum and bury his body? Despite Lenin’s declining popularity, it is a controversial question. When debating it earlier this year, a popular Russian TV talk show descended into a shouting match. “Remove Lenin, he’s a criminal,” shouted one nationalist politician. What’s the point?” retorted a communist MP. “Will that make food prices any lower?” A nun chimed in: “Who brought us Lenin? The Germans did in a sealed train. I say put his body back in the same train and send it back to them!” Among the guests taking part in that raucous TV show was businessman Stanislav Svistunov. I visit him at his factory in the north of Moscow. Stanislav’s company decorates plastic products, including funeral accessories. Plastic coffin handles and crucifixes go into the machines and when they emerge they are sparkling with a golden coating. There is an irony to Stanislav being in the business of religious appendages. He shows me a book. It is the family history of Vladimir Lenin - the communist who declared war on the Church. “I am Lenin’s great-great-grandnephew,” declares Stanislav, pointing to a family tree. “My great-great-great-grandmother, Sophia, was the sister of Maria, Lenin’s mother.” Stanislav assures me that only once did his family benefit from their famous relative. One year back in the 1930s winter was so cold that his great-grandfather and great-grandmother had to burn some of their furniture to keep warm. Out of desperation they wrote to the authorities mentioning the family connection. Stanislav Svistunov - related to Lenin “Some people came to check their identity papers. Shortly after, a lorry arrived with firewood. My great-grandfather was sworn to secrecy about it.” As for what to do with Lenin’s body, Stanislav assumes it will be up to the Kremlin to decide. “Only one man can take the decision to bury Lenin - our president,” Stanislav tells me. He raises an interesting point. If Lenin’s body is removed from Red Square, does that meanall the other bodies interred thereshould be taken away, too? There are lots of them. More than 200 revolutionaries lie in a mass grave on Red Square. Also buried beside the Kremlin are dozens of Soviet leaders, scientists, military commanders and cosmonauts. “One idea may be to bury Lenin inside the mausoleum,” suggests Stanislav. “This would partly satisfy those people who say his body should be in the ground, and those who want him to stay on Red Square. I back this option.” The Orthodox Church takes a different view. “He should be buried. Not because he deserves a Christian funeral - he was anti-Christian. But because this symbol of the revolution should find its proper place - not on Red Square and not in a mausoleum,” says Metropolitan Hilarion. “I regret his burial was not conducted in the early 1990s, when it would have been easier to do. It is more difficult now. There will be protests. The Communist Party is strongly against this. But I believe it is only a matter of time before he is buried. This should be done sooner or later.” “Lenin lived! Lenin lives! Lenin will live!” proclaimed a famous Soviet slogan. In a way, he does live on - in the thousands of Lenin statues, Lenin Avenues and Lenin Squares that exist in Russia to this day; in his mausoleum beside the Kremlin; in the hearts of committed communists. But the shadow he casts over Russia is fading. Whether or not his body remains in Red Square, to most Russians now the man who made the revolution is like those statues I saw in the park - a ghost from a lost world. Outside Yekaterinburg, autumn has carpeted the forest with golden leaves. All around me, silver birches seem to be whispering, as their leaves rustle in the breeze. It is so beautiful here - like walking through a Russian fairy tale. Then, through the trees, I spot something that jars with the magical setting - an Orthodox cross. It marks the place of a grim discovery - the remains of Russia’s last tsar, Nicholas II, and his family. The Bolsheviks had murdered them, mutilated their bodies, and disposed of their victims in a shallow grave in the forest. Pensioner Vladimir Kotlyakov is sweeping leaves and twigs away from the cross. He comes every day to keep this place tidy. Vladimir Kotlyakov Nicholas II believed he had a God-given right to rule Russia. But frustrated by food shortages and setbacks in World War One, his subjects reached a different conclusion. Following the February Revolution, Nicholas was forced to abdicate. His brother refused the throne - three centuries of Romanov rule were over. Nicholas, his wife Alexandra and their five children - Olga, Tatiana, Maria, Anastasia and Alexei - were placed under house arrest near St Petersburg. Later they were moved to Siberia and, a few months after the October Revolution, transported to Yekaterinburg in the Ural Mountains. They were locked inside the Ipatiev House. The Bolsheviks referred to it, ominously, as the House of Special Purpose. Around midnight on 17 July 1918, the Romanovs and four of their most loyal servants were taken down to the basement - for their own safety, they were told.There they were shot and bayoneted by a Bolshevik execution squad. It was a brutal, bloody end to the most powerful dynasty in modern European history. The Soviets demolished the Ipatiev House in 1977 - an attempt to erase the memory of the tsar. But on the spot where the house stood, modern Russia has built a church. The tsar’s killers saw themselves as gods. This sickness of the mind became the fever of the 20th Century.” Painted on the walls of the Church on the Blood are scenes from Tsar Nicholas’s life, such as his coronation. At the front of the church an icon bears the faces of the tsar, tsarina and their children. The Orthodox Church has elevated them to sainthood. “The calamities Russia endured, the civil war, the 1930s terror, World War Two, they were all a punishment for what happened here,” Bishop Yevgeny of the Urals diocese tells me. “Emperor Nicholas understood that God was above him. But the tsar’s killers saw themselves as gods. This sickness of the mind became the fever of the 20th Century.” In the 1990s, a Russian government commission concluded that the bones exhumed in the forest belonged to Nicholas, Alexandra and three of their children - Olga, Tatiana and Anastasia. They were laid to rest in St Petersburg. In 2007what were believed to be the remains of Maria and Alexei were found. The Russian Orthodox Church demanded further tests and has yet to recognise these as the remains of the Romanovs. But when I spoke to him in Moscow, Metropolitan Hilarion indicated that there was “a very strong chance” the Church would do so in the near future. In a building next to the Church on the Blood, I attend a children’s choir rehearsal. Looking down from the wall is Nicholas II. His portrait provides inspiration to the young choristers. “The tsar and his family set us a moral example that we try to follow,” Alexandra explains. “They believed in God so much, they suffered for it.” “I always think of him as the captain of a big ship called Russia,” says Anastasiya. “He was on this ship till the very end, till the country ended. He was so brave and I admire him.” Anastasiya: “[Tsar Nicholas] was so brave and I admire him.” It is an idealised and somewhat distorted image of Russia’s last tsar. For, if Nicholas II was the captain, does he not bear some responsibility for the sinking of imperial Russia? It was the tsar’s soldiers who fired on peaceful protesters outside the Winter Palace in 1905. It was Nicholas who brought the mystic and faith-healerGrigory Rasputininto the royal court. As a private adviser to the Romanovs, the renegade monk interfered in matters of state and further damaged the prestige of the monarchy. Illustration portraying Bloody Sunday, January 1905, when tsarist soldiers fired upon unarmed marchers in St Petersburg Nicholas’s decision to take personal command of the tsarist army in World War One proved disastrous. And ever the inflexible autocrat, the tsar was incapable of steering Russia clear of revolution. The Provisional Government that took over from him made mistakes, too. But ultimately, the Bolsheviks seized power in a country that had been weakened by years of imperial mismanagement. In post-communist Russia, it is not only the tsar who is enjoying a revival. So is the Church. In 1989, Russia had 6,000 Orthodox churches. Today there are more than 36,000. Formerly a pillar of tsarist autocracy, Orthodoxy once again enjoys a close connection to the state. As the Kremlin strives to shape a new national ideology around patriotism and ultra-conservative values,the Church is playing a key role. In a school playground on the edge of Yekaterinburg, I watch children practising traditional Cossack sword-spinning. The school, which has built its own church, is one of several in the area where education is centred on piety, patriotism and a glorious past. “We are rediscovering our culture of a century ago, not just with swords, but with songs and dances,” 14-year-old Nikolai tells me. “But for me, faith is the most important thing in life - it is the reason we are here.” I talk to the school director, Alexei Solovyov. He recalls that in Soviet times, when atheism was an official state doctrine, only one church was open in Yekaterinburg, or Sverdlovsk, as it was known under communism. It is a city of more than a million people. “Outside the church there were always police in civilian clothes,” recalls Alexei. “They didn’t harass the old people. But any young people that went up to the door were taken aside for a conversation.” Yet communism failed to replace God in Russians’ hearts. “My great-grandmother was a communist,” Alexei recalls. “She worked as a cook. She even cooked for Tsar Nikolai’s killers in the Ipatiev House. But in the 1930s she was a victim of Stalin’s purges. She spent five years in the gulag for being a ‘Trotskyite’. When she came out, she ditched all that revolutionary hype and turned to religion.” But if Russians are looking to the past to shape their future, might they decide to restore the monarchy? That is unlikely. “Monarchy is a good way of governing,” schoolteacher Olga tells me. “But times have changed. Anyway, our president is a man who kind of governs the way the tsar tried to govern. He is a real ruler, a real patriot. He doesn’t allow other countries to humiliate our citizens.” Back in the forest, where the bones of Nicholas II were found, Vladimir Kotlyakov seems confused. “Russia needs a tsar. I’m fed up with disorder here. ‘President’ isn’t a Russian word. ‘Tsar’ – now that’s a Russian word!  Let the people choose a tsar.” My trip to Yekaterinburg has reminded me that Russia is a country of extremes. It is a country that can leap from “Down with the Tsar!” to “Saint Nicholas”; from destroying churches to building them; from communism to capitalism; from freezing winters to boiling hot summers. It is a country of contradictions. The Russian Revolution hadn’t even happened when Lev Lipovich was born. By the time the Bolsheviks had seized the Winter Palace, Lev was already seven months old. A hundred years of Russian history are etched into his face. Lev Lipovich “I fought in four wars, and I survived three famines,” Lev tells me with a hint of pride. We are sitting in his tiny apartment in the city of Khabarovsk, the capital of the Russian Far East. Out of the window you can see the point where the two great rivers of eastern Russia meet - the Amur and the Ussuri. On the roads here there are few Russian-built cars - it is cheaper for people to buy right-hand drives from Japan. The border with China is just 25km from here. Red Square feels a world away. And we are more than 6,000km (3,700 miles) from the cradle of the October Revolution, St Petersburg. Khabarovsk “I am a son of October,” he explains. “To me, Revolution Day - 7 November - is my second birthday because I see that as the day the USSR was born.” Lev was born in the Crimea in April 1917. When he was 11, his parents sent him to a factory boarding school. “For my first 20 years my motherland fed me, clothed me, put shoes on my feet. It gave me an education. When I joined the army, I started to repay my debt to my country.” At the age of 15, Lev learnt to fly. He became a fighter pilot. His first experience of battle was the Winter War between the Soviet Union and Finland; he fought in World War Two, what Russians refer to as the Great Patriotic War; in 1945 he flew missions against Japan and in North Korea. He concedes he is lucky to be alive. While battling Nazi Germany, he was shot down over the Baltic Sea. “The shell hit my right engine,” he recalls. “No sooner had I catapulted out, the plane burst into flames. For four hours I struggled in the water. Then a Soviet submarine spotted me and pulled me out.” In peacetime Lev switched to civil aviation. In his 47 years as a pilot, he recorded an astonishing 36,000 flight hours - the equivalent of four years in the air. Lev opens a folder and takes out a faded certificate - it is an official letter of thanks to him from Joseph Stalin. He speaks fondly of the Soviet dictator. Lev's letter of thanks from Joseph Stalin “On the side of my warplane were these words: 'For the motherland! For Stalin!' “But what about the repressions?” I ask. “What about Stalin’s terror?” “You don’t understand,” he says dismissively. “Stalin was a patriot. He was an intelligent, modest, iron man.” He tells me how he thinks Russians have survived a century of drama and bloodshed. “Because our people are strong; we are patriotic; we love our land and we are ready to die for it.” Lev talks at length about the USSR’s military encounters with foreign powers. Yet when he was a child, Russians were fighting Russians. The civil war that followed the revolution divided families across the country - it was bloody and brutal. Forces loyal to the Bolsheviks, the Reds, were battling the opponents of communism, the Whites. Not until 1922 did the Bolsheviks finally establish control over the Far East. The decisive battle of the civil war took place near Khabarovsk, on a hill by the village of Volochaevka. When the Reds won, the victors did all they could to make sure that history would record them as the heroes. Soviet artists produced a 43m-long panoramic painting of the battle to proclaim the victory of communism. It was celebrated in song, too. A military march about Volochaevka became one of the most popular numbers in the Red Army Choir’s repertoire. On the battle site, a museum was built to honour the heroism and sacrifice of the pro-Soviet soldiers. A memorial plaque referred to 118 Reds in a communal grave. There was no mention of the Whites who died here. The monument marking the battle at Volochaevka Yet as post-communist Russia begins to look more critically at the revolution, the official interpretation of the civil war, too, is changing. On Volochaevka hill today the museum is closed; the building is crumbling. The Orthodox Church has erected a small chapel here - a sign that this area is no longer a communist shrine. At the local high school, children are taught that the civil war was a tragedy for all Russians, with no “good guys” or “bad guys”. The school museum recounts the battle of Volochaevka in neutral tones. On display here are rusting bayonets, bullet casings and guns from the battle, found by students in the forest. “It would be wrong to show a bias for the Reds or the Whites,” teacher Alexei Zaitsev tells me. “We try to find a middle way and recount this historical event through facts.” The school museum is open to the public. But not all the visitors appreciate the revised history. “It wasn’t that long ago that the Soviet Union disappeared,” Alexei reminds me. “Some of our visitors still support the USSR and don’t like what we say now about the Whites.” Like shifting sands, the past in Russia seems to change right under your feet. One moment Russians are being told to praise “Great October”; the next they are being told the revolution was not so great after all. One day religion is the “opium of the people”; the next it is the life and soul of Russia. So often here the past is rewritten, reinterpreted, reshaped, depending on who is in power. “Every 50 years everything changes here. We cope.” Back in Khabarovsk, I meet three generations of one family strolling in the park: 13-year-old Sofia, her mother, Anna, and grandmother, Nina. “It’s difficult when history changes,” Anna tells me. “It’s hard for youngsters to understand what is good and what is bad. TV says one thing, parents say another and teachers say something else.” “Yes,” says Sofia. “It’s hard to know which opinion is the right one.” “Then again, it’s always been like this in Russia,” reflects Anna. “Every 50 years everything changes here. We cope.” On the banks of the Amur river, I chat to pensioner Alexander Vasilievich. He is clearly struggling to make sense of Russia’s past. Alexander accuses the man who led the October Revolution of hoodwinking the people. “Lenin promised land to the peasants and factories to the workers. But he didn’t deliver.” He remembers how empty the shops were in Khabarovsk in Soviet times. “I used to fly to Moscow to buy shoes,” he admits. And yet Alexander is nostalgic about the communist past. “I want it all back as it was. Back then I always had a job and a decent salary. Workers had more social protection, too, than now.” “Not under Stalin, surely?” I reply. “What about the terror?” “Who on earth knows who was right back then and who was wrong?” he answers. “Who on earth knows…?” is not the kind of question you will hear from 100-year-old Lev Lipovich. I suspect he will always see himself as a “son of October” and retain an iron belief in the revolution and its ideals. But on my journey across Russia I have met many people who feel confused and disoriented by the current reinterpretation of history. For life is not easy in a country where not only the future is unpredictable, but also the past. Built with Shorthand"

Johnson to speak to Iran over jailed mum,"This video can not be played Mr Ratcliffe maintains his wife is innocent The husband of a British-Iranian woman, in prison in Iran, has urged Boris Johnson to retract his remark that she had been training journalists in Iran. Richard Ratcliffe said Iranian officials were using the foreign secretary's statement to justify extending his wife Nazanin's jail term. Mr Johnson has called his Iranian counterpart to clarify the situation. Liam Fox said his cabinet colleague's comment was a ""slip of the tongue"" but Labour said it was ""unacceptable"". Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe is serving a five-year sentence for allegedly plotting to topple the government in Tehran, although the official charges were never made public. Mr Ratcliffe maintains his wife's innocence, saying she was in Iran visiting family when she was arrested in 2016. She was summoned to court on Saturday where Mr Johnson's comment was cited as new evidence as to what she was doing in Iran. The Foreign Office said Mr Johnson now accepted he ""could have been clearer"" with his comments to the Foreign Affairs Committee. In a phone call to Iranian foreign minister Javad Zarif, Mr Johnson said that his remarks provided ""no justifiable basis"" for further legal action and he intended to visit Iran before the end of the year to discuss the case. Mr Zarif told the foreign secretary that the developments in the case over the weekend ""were unrelated"" to Mr Johnson's remarks, a Foreign Office statement added. Fears after Boris Johnson remark She was 'punished without a crime' Husband's plea for Briton held in Iran International Trade Secretary Liam Fox told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""We all make slips of the tongue"", adding on Sky News that it wasn't ""a serious gaffe"". But Labour's Tulip Siddiq, Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's MP, said it was ""unacceptable"" for Mr Johnson to ""lack a basic grasp on this important situation"". ""A slip of the tongue in my books is swearing in front of your child by mistake - it's not condemning a British citizen to an extra five years in prison,"" she said. Mr Ratcliffe told the BBC's Today programme that Mr Johnson should make a statement in the Commons, retracting what he said. He added the ""worst thing"" Mr Johnson could do now was ""suddenly go quiet and to create this problem without making any clarifications"". He said he still hoped his wife and young daughter would be back home in the UK for Christmas. This video can not be played Liam Fox tells BBC's Today that Boris Johnson's comment about Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was a ""slip of the tongue"" Former Conservative foreign secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind told the BBC Mr Johnson needed ""to concentrate more"" and ""get the detail right"". Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was sentenced to jail following a court hearing into whether she was attempting to overthrow the government. She denies all the allegations against her, but lost her final appeal in April. She has since faced two more charges relating to an accusation of plotting to topple the regime in Tehran. Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe has worked for the Thomson Reuters Foundation and the BBC, but insisted the 2016 visit was for her daughter to meet her grandparents. However, appearing before MPs on the House of Commons Foreign Affairs Select Committee last week, Mr Johnson appeared to contradict that. He criticised Iran over the case before saying: ""When I look at what Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe was doing, she was simply teaching people journalism, as I understand it. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe is serving a five-year sentence in Iran ""[Neither] Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe nor her family has been informed about what crime she has actually committed. And that I find extraordinary, incredible."" Four days later, Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was summoned to court where the foreign secretary's comments were cited as fresh evidence against her. At the hearing, she was accused of engaging in ""propaganda against the regime"". The Iranian judiciary's High Council for Human Rights said Mr Johnson's comments ""shed new light"" on the charity worker and proved Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe ""had visited the country for anything but a holiday"". Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe had been eligible for parole under the early release scheme from 23 November. However, Mr Ratcliffe told the Press Association that she could now face a fresh trial before that date to block her chance of freedom. ""I think the one thing the foreign secretary could do to make amends would be if he went to visit her in the next few weeks before her trial,"" he said. ""Careless talk has a cost and there's been a lot of careless talk."" Monique Villa, chief executive of the Thomson Reuters Foundation, called on Mr Johnson to ""immediately correct the serious mistake he made"".

Gibbons saved from pet trade have baby,"This video can not be played The arrival of the new baby gibbon provides hope for the future of this endangered species Conservationists are celebrating the arrival of a baby Javan gibbon - the first of this species to be born in the wild to parents that were rescued from the pet trade. Conservation International says the birth is a boost for the future of the apes on the Indonesian island of Java. But illegal trade is still a threat, and is increasingly moving online. A UK-based investigation this year,externalrevealed that the law protecting these ape species was being openly ""flouted"". Researchers who carried out the investigation, who are based at Oxford Brookes University, also showed BBC News videos of protected species being advertised by pet traders on social media platforms. The birth of the wild-born Javan gibbon - in a protected forest in West Java - is a breakthrough for a project that has now released 17 of the apes into the area. Conservation International (CI) and the Javan Gibbon Foundation have rehabilitated the animals, and rangers now patrol the site at Mount Malabar daily, monitoring the animals and checking for any poaching activity. It has taken almost 10 years to bring the two adults back to the forest. ""It's a long, long process,"" explained Anton Ario from CI. ""Because the poachers that take gibbons for the trade target the babies - because they're cute and easy to sell - when we find them, they're often living in a cage and cannot move around at all. They need to learn to live in the trees."" To ensure their rereleased animals are able to survive, they introduce them to potential mates while they are still in captivity - ultimately releasing pairs or family groups of the animals. The new birth represents hope for a primate that is rapidly losing its habitat in Java, which has less than 5% of pristine forest left in its steep, tropical mountains. But while programmes like this can get a few animals back to the wild every year, many more are being bought and sold as pets. Young orangutans are targeted by the illegal pet trade A search on social media channels will reveal pet shops and sellers - many based in South East Asia - openly advertising pet baby gibbons for sale. ""They are flouting the law,"" says Prof Vincent Nijman, from Oxford Brookes University, who has carried out investigations of the illegal trade in endangered apes. Researchers monitoring the trade showed us pictures and videos of gibbons being advertised for sale on social media platforms, including Facebook and Instagram ""No-one is being punished. ""So if people [entering the forest] come across a baby gibbon and have the option to capture it, they are motivated to do it. It represents money and doesn't represent any risk."" The trade is not confined to gibbons. Critically endangered orangutans and slow lorises are also being ""plucked"" from the wild. Prof Nijman's recently published investigation revealed that, while more than 400 illegal pet orangutans had been seized by law enforcement in Indonesia in the last two decades, those confiscations had led to only seven prosecutions. Rescued apes have to be rehabilitated by conservationists, who help them learn to return to the trees after life in a cage BBC News reported a post to Facebook that advertised a baby gibbon for sale. In response, the company said it had removed the post and was ""investigating the page where it was posted"". ""We're committed to helping tackle the illegal online trade of protected wildlife and will remove any content that violates our community standards when it is reported to us,"" Facebook said in a statement. Instagram has also responded after the BBC alerted it to the sale of gibbons on the site. In a statement sent to BBC News, the company said that the accounts in question had been removed, adding that the illegal trade or sale of animals was ""prohibited on Instagram"". Prof Nijman pointed out that the numerous threats to endangered apes in Indonesia were not all problems that people had the power to tackle. ""Orangutans in particular face threats left, right and centre,"" he said, ""But curbing the pet trade is within our control. ""It's in human hands to fix this.""

NHS staff 'working on edge of safety',"NHS staff in England are working on the ""edge of safety"" as rising demand is outstripping the increasing numbers being employed, health bosses say. There are now 6% more staff than there were three years ago, but demand for services has risen by three times as much in some areas. NHS Providers, which represents health chiefs, said staff shortages was now the number one concern in the NHS. But ministers insisted there were plans in place to tackle the problem. Over the past year, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has announced rises in the number of training places for both doctors and nurses. The Department of Health said this represented the ""biggest ever expansion of training places"" and would help ensure the NHS had the staff it needed.

But Saffron Cordery, of NHS Providers, said there was no guarantee this would work as there was no over-arching ""coherent or credible"" strategy. She said her members were really worried about the shortages on the front line, which was leaving staff with ""undoable"" jobs. ""They are now working on the edge of safe services. We are seeing so much pressure on the front line."" She added the prospect of Brexit was just making things worse, with EU staff facing ""much uncertainty"" about their jobs and future careers in the NHS. Just last week, figures from the Nursing and Midwifery Council showed the number of EU nurses and midwives registered to work in the UK had fallen by 2,700 in the past year, to just over 36,000. The report by NHS Providers found the total number of staff working in the NHS had risen by 6%, to 1 million, between 2013-14 and 2016-17. Bu the same period had also seen the following rises in demand for services: diagnostic tests: 19% visits to accident and emergency units: 7% emergency admissions: 10% ambulance calls: 15% GP referrals: 11% Labour shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said: ""This is a damning report. The staffing crisis facing our NHS reflects a fundamental failure at national level on workforce strategy. ""In the upcoming Budget, the government must fully fund the scrapping of the pay cap for NHS staff and bring forward wider funding to put our NHS on a sustainable footing."" Royal College of Nursing general secretary Janet Davies said: ""Ministers can no longer dismiss warnings of this kind.""

'Tubby and terrified': How fear puts girls off PEGirls are half as likely as boys to be physically active - and lack of confidence is to blame.6h6 hours agoFamily & Education,"Gracie says learning to love PE has transformed her life Gracie Rowe used to be terrified of PE. ""I was on the tubby side. ""My personal self-consciousness was like a devil on my shoulder telling me I couldn't do it. ""It was the fact that I had to move, be active and sweat. ""I would just stand and watch and mope."" Gracie says she had zero self-confidence when she started secondary school. She was so nervous that she tried to persuade her mum she was sick most days and twice-weekly PE lessons were a particular source of stress. ""I was worried that people judged me. It was because I wasn't happy with myself."" The school's PE uniform didn't help: ""It was a 'skort' - sort of shorts and skirt in one - and it was quite tight and short. ""All my friends hated PE just as much as I did."" Hayley Wood-Thompson, Gracie's PE teacher at The John Warner School in Hertfordshire, says about half of the girls feel the same. The school shares its site with a sports centre, so has the use of excellent facilities. ""We offer quite a broad spectrum of activities. There is a dance studio and swimming pool. But lots of the girls are still turned off by it."" Hayley Wood-Thompson is a PE teacher at The John Warner School The UK's chief medical officer recommends school-age children do at least an hour of exercise each day. But new research with 25,000 secondary students in England and Northern Ireland suggests that, at secondary level, only 8% of girls and 16% of boys manage this. Of the teenagers, surveyed by Youth Sport Trust and Women in Sport, more than 80% understood the importance of being active but almost half of boys and nearly two-thirds of girls were less than keen on taking part themselves. The research suggests lack of confidence is key. Among girls over 14, more than a third said they felt insecure, hated other people watching them and were self-conscious about their bodies. Almost two-thirds said they disliked competitive PE lessons. Gracie's mum and her teachers realised they had to boost her confidence to ensure she attended school. Her mum brought her in for meetings with the head of year - and the school enrolled her on to a healthy living project to improve her self-esteem. At the same time, big reforms to the school's PE programme were under way, designed to encourage girls to engage with the subject. First off, skorts were out, replaced by black sports leggings. ""It's the sort of thing you might wear to the gym on a Saturday morning. It feels a bit more adult,"" says Ms Wood-Thompson. The school also now divides its PE programme into pathways, allowing girls and boys to choose how much competitive and outdoors sport to do. ""The girls-only pathway is tailored to boosting levels of confidence. ""There will be a bit more aerobics, dance, being inside in the winter. So they're not turned off by being outside in the rain and cold. ""More sporty girls are offered a mixed programme with the less athletic boys - this might involve dodgeball, football and more competitive games. ""And sporty boys have a boys-only programme."" Gracie's activities include field days and camps with the Combined Cadet Force Gracie Rowe chose the girls-only pathway and liked it. ""It was just the fact that we didn't need to show off to anyone or act like someone we're not."" Gradually her confidence improved. She not only started to join in PE, but began to enjoy it and made friends. ""It helped me forget what other people thought of me and have confidence in myself."" Now 14, she is no longer tubby, plays in the football team for her school year, takes dance classes and is in the gym ""all the time"". She also joined the Combined Cadet Force run at a nearby private school, knows how a rifle works and takes part in field days and camps. Last year the school nominated her as a leader on theYouth Sport Trust's Girls' Active programme,,externalwhich aims to tackle girls' negative body images, improve attitudes to physical activity and to make sport more relevant to them. Girls Active encourages girls who have overcome their fear of PE to help their classmates ""She has made the biggest improvement I have ever seen,"" says her PE teacher. ""I know that not every girl is going to have a fully positive experience in every PE lesson every day but I hope I can enthuse them enough to encourage them to take part. It's all about relationships."" She hopes the young leaders on the programme will help other girls overcome barriers to physical activity. ""They are very keen to improve the mental health and self-esteem of their peers. ""They really care about trying to remove the stigma of being active and getting sweaty and to foster a happy, supportive and relaxed environment for PE."" Gracie says a myriad of factors can stop girls being active ""but you realise you don't have to be like that or think like that"". ""I feel empowered now to influence other girls who were like me by showing them that there is no limit to what you can do. ""It doesn't matter on your size, age or ability level, start with what you are comfortable with and push those boundaries. Don't let anyone hold you back.""

Post-Brexit trade plans to be publishedThe Trade Bill is aimed at helping UK continue to access EU agreements and seek remedies in disputes.5h5 hours agoUK Politics,"Details of the government's post-Brexit trade policy have been published. Ministerssay the Trade Bill,externalincludes provisions for the UK to implement existing EU trade agreements and help ensure firms can still access foreign government contracts worth Â£1.3tn. It will also create a new trade remedies body to defend UK businesses against injurious trade practices. International Trade Secretary Liam Fox said firms needed ""as much stability as possible"" on the day the UK leaves. But Labour questioned why the bill was being published on the day Parliament rises for a week-long recess, suggesting ministers wanted to ""minimise scrutiny"". And unions said workers' rights must not be sacrificed on the altar of doing ""dodgy deals"" with countries with insufficient employment protections. The UK cannot sign or negotiate trade deals before its scheduled departure from the EU in March 2019. However, ministers say they can ""scope"" out future deals with key trade partners, such as the US, Australia and New Zealand. Despite its publication, the Trade Bill, one of nine pieces of new legislation in the pipeline to prepare the ground for Brexit, will not be debated by MPs until a later date. Ross backs post-Brexit UK-US trade deal Brexit studies not what you think - Davis Reality Check: Who does UK trade with on WTO rules? Mr Fox said the point of the bill was to ""provide as much stability as possible"" for businesses on the day Britain leaves the EU and to prevent market instability. But looking beyond that, the UK wanted to negotiate ""more liberal"" trade agreements to ""provide even better market access than we have through our EU membership"". ""One of our worries is that global trade is not opening up,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme, and the UK wanted to ""use its influence to get a more liberal global trading system"" once it had left the EU. But TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said the ""ramshackle bill"" offered no protection for workers' rights and for public services like the NHS from foreign contractors. ""The Trade Bill must guarantee that the price of entry to a trade deal involving Britain is signing up to the strongest protections for workers and public services,"" she said. On the eve of the bill's publication, one of Donald Trump's leading allies said he was optimistic that the UK and US will sign a free trade deal after Brexit. US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross told the BBC there had already been a ""joint scoping exercise"" in Washington in July on a free trade agreement and another similar meeting will be held in London next week. ""We're huge trading partners with each other and our economies are in many ways more similar to each other than either of us is to most of Europe,"" he said. ""So there's all the logic in the world for the US and the UK to be not only good trading partners, but FTA partners,"" he said. Mr Ross, who met Theresa May and other senior ministers during a two-day visit, identified continued ""passporting"" of financial services, compliance with EU food standards on GM crops and chlorine-washed chicken and future trade tariffs as areas that could pose problems in negotiations between the nations.

Berlusconi set for political comebackA coalition backed by the former prime minister wins Sicily elections.7h7 hours agoEurope,"The 81-year-old's long political career has been plagued by scandals Former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi looks set for another political comeback after a coalition he backed won Sicily's regional elections. The result adds momentum to the newly formed centre-right alliance. The vote on the Italian island has been viewed as a crucial test ahead of next year's national election. The 81-year-old billionaire businessman's career has been beset by scandals both in and out of government. The four-time prime minister has been away from the political centre stagesince he was expelled from parliament four years ago after being convicted of tax fraud. Mr Berlusconi is seeking to overturn a ban that bars him from public office ahead of the spring 2018 vote. The European Court of Human Rights is set to review his case later this year. Mr Berlusconi owned football club AC Milan for three decades, but sold it in 2017 ""Sicily, just as I asked, has chosen the path of real, serious, constructive change, based on honesty, competence and experience,"" hesaid in a video posted on Facebook,external. The many trials of Silvio Berlusconi explained Italy's once-untouchable prime minister In pictures: Berlusconi in politics The newly formed coalition brings together Mr Berlusconi's Forza Italia party with right-wing parties Northern League and Brothers of Italy. The Berlusconi-backed candidate Nello Musumeci beat the anti-establishment Five Star Movement candidate, with just under 40% of the vote. However, more than 50% of Sicilians did not cast a vote, according to Italian media. Mr Musumeci said his first task was to try to reach non-voters.

Trump's trip - what's in store?,"US President Donald Trump is on his first official trip to Asia, passing through Japan, South Korea, China, Vietnam and the Philippines. From trade to etiquette, each stop will have its own challenges. So here is a (non-exhaustive) beginner's guide to the issues at stake. Mr Trump starts off by visiting Washington's closest Asian friends: Japan and South Korea. But it's North Korea they will be talking about. Pyongyang has already sent two long range missiles over Japan and conducted its sixth and biggest nuclear test. Despite harsher sanctions, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has shown no sign of slowing down the pace of weapons development. Skittish observers wonder if the visit will prompt Pyongyang to do something rash. But if talks with almost every leader are about how to deal with North Korea, there is unlikely to be any real consensus. Here are some key questions from this leg of the trip: How much reassurance can Trump provide?With Japanese citizens rehearsing drills in case of a nuclear attack, Tokyo will want to know the US will provide military co-operation.  Seoul, literally in the firing line of its northern neighbour with artillery positioned over the border, will want the same. Will Trump tweet while so close to the North?After anunprecedented personal warning to Mr Trump from Kim Jong-un, Seoul will want him to tone down his rhetoric and keep options for dialogue open. Any threats exchanged when he is literally over the border won't go down well. How will he like the viral Pen Pineapple song?In Tokyo he is also set to meet Piko Taro, singer of the Pen-Pineapple-Apple-Penearworm that swept the globe. What about that awkward handshake?Mr Trump and Japan's PM Shinzo Abe are thought to have a strong relationship, but people will watch closely after thepatting and twitching of their last 19-second handshake. 'I have a pen... I have an apple...' China is North Korea's chief economic supporter and Mr Trump is likely to seek continued support for sanctions. But Chinese leader Xi Jinping has just emerged from a Communist Party Congress that saw his power reach unprecedented levels, so he may not feel the need to compromise. Few observers expect radical shifts in the US-China relationship, but they will be watching for any clues to shifts in the global balance of power. China set out its stall earlier this year with a push to its 2013Belt and Road project, a vast global trade network with China at its heart. Here are other things to look out for: Will he assert US military dominance?The South China Sea dispute may have been quiet over the last few months as North Korea rumbled, but nonetheless China is going ahead with development in the disputed sea. Will he talk tough on trade?Mr Trump is known for lambasting China overallegedly unfair trade policies, currency manipulation and stealing US jobs. He has just called the US trade deficit with China ""embarrassing"" but what can he achieve in practice? Will Chinese social media meme the meet?Chinese social media is known for its creative memes (remember theWinnie the Pooh and Tigger memeswhen Mr Xi met President Obama?) Will they move faster than the censors this time? Will the internet rise to the challenge and come up with a new version of this? By the time Mr Trump gets to Vietnam and the Philippines we should know more about how the US is positioning itself in Asia. Trade is likely to be key. Mr Trump pulled out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) free trade deal, frustrating many, including Vietnam, his host at the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) Economic Leaders' meeting. Even Japan and Korea are nervous the US will back off from bilateral trade agreements. His ""America First!"" slogan is aimed at a domestic audience but does not go down well with trade partners abroad.

Post-Brexit trade plans to be published,"Details of the government's post-Brexit trade policy have been published. Ministerssay the Trade Bill,externalincludes provisions for the UK to implement existing EU trade agreements and help ensure firms can still access foreign government contracts worth Â£1.3tn. It will also create a new trade remedies body to defend UK businesses against injurious trade practices. International Trade Secretary Liam Fox said firms needed ""as much stability as possible"" on the day the UK leaves. But Labour questioned why the bill was being published on the day Parliament rises for a week-long recess, suggesting ministers wanted to ""minimise scrutiny"". And unions said workers' rights must not be sacrificed on the altar of doing ""dodgy deals"" with countries with insufficient employment protections. The UK cannot sign or negotiate trade deals before its scheduled departure from the EU in March 2019. However, ministers say they can ""scope"" out future deals with key trade partners, such as the US, Australia and New Zealand. Despite its publication, the Trade Bill, one of nine pieces of new legislation in the pipeline to prepare the ground for Brexit, will not be debated by MPs until a later date. Ross backs post-Brexit UK-US trade deal Brexit studies not what you think - Davis Reality Check: Who does UK trade with on WTO rules? Mr Fox said the point of the bill was to ""provide as much stability as possible"" for businesses on the day Britain leaves the EU and to prevent market instability. But looking beyond that, the UK wanted to negotiate ""more liberal"" trade agreements to ""provide even better market access than we have through our EU membership"". ""One of our worries is that global trade is not opening up,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme, and the UK wanted to ""use its influence to get a more liberal global trading system"" once it had left the EU. But TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said the ""ramshackle bill"" offered no protection for workers' rights and for public services like the NHS from foreign contractors. ""The Trade Bill must guarantee that the price of entry to a trade deal involving Britain is signing up to the strongest protections for workers and public services,"" she said. On the eve of the bill's publication, one of Donald Trump's leading allies said he was optimistic that the UK and US will sign a free trade deal after Brexit. US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross told the BBC there had already been a ""joint scoping exercise"" in Washington in July on a free trade agreement and another similar meeting will be held in London next week. ""We're huge trading partners with each other and our economies are in many ways more similar to each other than either of us is to most of Europe,"" he said. ""So there's all the logic in the world for the US and the UK to be not only good trading partners, but FTA partners,"" he said. Mr Ross, who met Theresa May and other senior ministers during a two-day visit, identified continued ""passporting"" of financial services, compliance with EU food standards on GM crops and chlorine-washed chicken and future trade tariffs as areas that could pose problems in negotiations between the nations.

"End puerile political slogans, says Major","Sir John Major has hit out at the use of ""puerile"" political slogans as he called for more honesty in government about the challenges facing the UK. The ex-prime minister said political leaders should avoid ""deceitful"" sound bites and be more candid about the limitations of what government can do. In a speech in London, he recounted how his use of the phrase ""back to basics"" in 1993 had ended up ""perverting a thoroughly worthwhile social policy"". Sir John was PM between 1990 and 1997. Addressing an audience in Westminster Abbey, Sir John also warned about factionalism in his party and the British political system as a whole and of the risk that ""partisan"" voices ""appealing to the extremes"" posed to democracy. ""The anti-European right wish to control the Conservative Party,"" he said. ""The neo-Marxist left wish to dominate Labour. Both are making headway in a battle for the soul of their respective parties."" In a strong attack on what he suggested was the debasing of modern politics, he called for special advisers to be reined in, saying they were being used as ""attack dogs"", leaking material and usurping civil servants. He suggested the language of politics was being corrupted by the tendency of politicians to fall back on pre-prepared and meaningless sound bites. Sir John, who has called Brexit a historic blunder, cited the Leave campaign's promise during the EU referendum to ""take back control"" as a ""memorable example of pitch-perfect absurdity"". Such slogans, he argued, ""convey nothing, explain nothing and are worth nothing"". ""As voters hear our elected representatives uttering puerile slogans instead of explaining policy, it is no wonder if respect for them melts away. Slogans and sound bites are a deceit. ""Electors deserve the truth in plain English, not in fairy tales."" Sir John conceded his own use of the phrase ""back to basics"" in his 1993 Tory conference speech - in which he called for more emphasis on personal responsibility, respect for law and order and a return to ""the old values of neighbourliness, decency and courtesy"" - was counter-productive. Because it was followed by a string of sex and financial scandals involving ministers, the speech came to be associated with personal morality and probity. ""They [slogans] can mislead,"" he added. ""I once used the phrase back to basics and it was taken up to pervert a thoroughly worthwhile social policy."" Theresa May was criticised for her frequent use of the phrase ""strong and stable"" during the election campaign while Jeremy Corbyn relied heavily on his claim to be ""for the many not the few"". In his speech, Sir John warned that the massive task of extricating the UK from the EU was ""crowding"" out other vital issues and said his party needed to talk more about levels of income disparity and regional imbalances which ""surely cannot be permitted to continue as they are"".

A bit more on the revelation from the Paradise Papers that Prince Charles campaigned to alter climate-change agreements without disclosing his private estate had an offshore financial interest in what he was promoting. On Tuesday, a spokesman for the Prince denied that Charles had spoken out
on the climate-change deals in order to benefit financially. ""The Prince has never chosen to speak out on a topic simply because of a
company that The Duchy may have invested in,"" he said.
 ""In the case of climate change his views are well-known, indeed he has been
warning of the threat of global warming to our environment for over 30 years."" The spokesman added that carbon markets were just one of many strategies

Air Force 'failed' to flag Texas shooter,"Kelley is believed to have been in a family row with his ex-wife and in-laws, police say The US Air Force has said it is investigating its apparent failure to enter information about Texas gunman Devin Patrick Kelley's criminal history into the national database. Ex-airman Kelley was court-martialled for domestic violence in 2012, and was barred from owning or buying guns. But last year he was able to purchase a rifle he used in Sunday's attack on a small church outside San Antonio. He killed 26 people and fled the scene. He was later found dead in his car. Police said he died from what appeared to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound after being chased by armed bystanders. Kelley was also shot in his leg and torso by a citizen, the regional director for the Texas Department of Public Safety, Freeman Martin, was quoted as saying by the Associated Press. The small town where everyone knows a victim Why are US mass shootings getting more deadly? In a statement, the Air Force said: ""Initial information indicates that [Devin] Kelley's domestic violence offense was not entered into the National Criminal Information Center database by the Holloman Air Force Base Office of Special Investigations."" This video can not be played How the Texas church mass shooting unfolded It said it was now - together with the Department of Defense - investigating the handling of Kelley's criminal records. Texas Governor Greg Abbott earlier said Kelley, 26, should not legally have been allowed to own a firearm, after having been denied a gun owner's permit by the state. Kelley bought the rifle from the Academy Sports + Outdoors shop in San Antonio. The store issued a statement sending ""deep condolences"" to the victims' families. Kelley was armed with the semi-automatic rifle and two pistols when he attacked the First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs during Sunday services. He had argued with his mother-in-law before the rampage, officials said. Kelley called his father after he was shot by an armed bystander and said he did not think he would survive. This video can not be played 'Our kids play together,' says a resident whose neighbours are feared dead ""This was not racially motivated, it wasn't over religious beliefs,"" said Mr Martin. ""There was a domestic situation going on with the family and in-laws,"" he said, adding that Kelley had sent threatening texts to his mother-in-law. ""We know that he expressed anger towards his mother-in-law, who attends this church,"" Mr Martin added. Twenty-six crosses were put in a field in Sutherland Spring - one cross for each of the victims On Monday evening, a vigil was held in Sutherland Springs. In one corner of the field, music played, people prayed, and hundreds of people held their hands in the air, the BBC's Owen Amos reports. In another, a floodlight illuminated 26 crosses - one for each person shot dead. Johnnie Langendorff (second right) and another man chased the shooter out of town Standing at the back, a feather in his cowboy hat, was Johnnie Langendorff - one of two men who chased the shooter out of town. People queued to shake Mr Langendorff's hand. At one point, a couple embraced him, and they stood in prayer for two or three minutes, our correspondent says. Wilson County Sheriff Joe Tackitt said between 12 and 14 children were among those killed in the attack in Sutherland Springs, a small town 30 miles (50km) south-east of the city of San Antonio. The youngest of those who died was only a year old. This video can not be played 'Belle died with her church family,' her mother said As many as eight members of the Holcombe family were killed in the shooting,the Washington Post reported,external. The BBC spoke to the Holcombes' neighbour Pauline Garza, who said the family did not come back from church. Sutherland Springs: The victims America's gun culture in 10 charts The First Baptist Church's pastor, Frank Pomeroy, told US media his 14-year-old daughter, Annabelle, was among those killed. Twenty people were also wounded. Kelley was court-martialled in 2012 after he was accused of assault against his wife and step-son. He was sentenced to 12 months' confinement. He received a ""bad conduct"" discharge two years later, according to Ann Stefanek, a US Air Force spokeswoman. Who was Sutherland Springs gunman? Gov Abbott said: ""It's clear this is a person who had violent tendencies, who had some challenges, and someone who was a powder keg, seeming waiting to go off."" Kelley worked till last July as a security guard for an amusement park run by the Schlitterbahn company in New Braunfels near Sutherland Springs. His employment was ""terminated"" after just over five weeks, the company said. He had a licence to work as an unarmed security guard, a job that police described as ""similar to a security guard at a concert-type situation"". ""There were no disqualifiers entered into the national crime information database to preclude him from receiving a private security licence,"" police said.

Robinson: Older stars on TV need to stay thin,"The Weakest Link host Anne Robinson says that older people have to be ""clever and thin"" to be on television. In an interview with the Radio Times, Robinson revealed she is ""permanently on a diet"" and never eats breakfast.

""I have said I will do Children in Need and see how I feel,"" she said. If The Weakest Link did return to TV screens on a regular basis, there would be more celebrities in the firing line, rather than members of the public. Robinson explained: ""They have asked whether I will consider doing celebrity shows, Saturday nights, next year."" In the interview, the presenter remarked that she severely restricts what she eats, and follows an exercise regime with a personal trainer. Robinson made the - possibly tongue-in-cheek - comments, saying: ""I'm like Victoria Beckham - you know, when she's really, really, really hungry, she has a piece of lettuce."" Asked if you have to be a certain size to appear on television, Robinson replied: ""You don't necessarily, but in order to be on television when you're old, you have to be clever and thin."" She said she had cosmetic surgery on her face 14 years ago and now has ""a bit of Botox - not a lot"". She added: ""But to be fair, I don't drink or smoke. I run and do weights."" Robinson presented The Weakest Link until 2011 Robinson recently fronted a BBC Two documentary, Abortion on Trial, and says she'd like to make more documentaries - including ones on sexual harassment and the 100th anniversary of women getting the vote. Seven celebrities are taking part in The Weakest Link special: Strictly star Chizzy Akudolu, Love Island winner Kem Cetinay, Cold Feet's John Thomson, chef Rosemary Shrager, writer and presenter Giles Coren, This Morning's Rylan Clark-Neal and Cannonball presenter Maya Jama. The Weakest Link Celebrity Special for BBC Children in Need will be on BBC Two at 2200 GMT on 17 November.

Retailers see worst ever non-food sales,"Sales of non-food items grew at the slowest pace since records began as families chose days out over shopping, the British Retail Consortium has said. Non-food sales rose by just 0.2% in the year to October, the weakest growth since the BRC began measuring the category in January 2011. The retail body said the figures would give retailers ""cause for concern"" in the run up to Christmas. Clothing sales were ""particularly hard hit"", it said. Total retail sales, including food, rose just 0.2% last month, compared with 2.4% last year. On a like-for-like basis, which excludes new store openings, sales were down 1%. The High Street struggling to survive BRC chief executive Helen Dickinson said ""consumers appear to have opted for outdoor experiences and excursions during half term, over visits to the shops"". The figures  - which were compiled with accountancy firm KPMG - come just seven weeks before Christmas, the key trading period for most retailers. Ms Dickinson said that the rise in inflation, which hit its highest for more than five years in September, was making shoppers ""ever more cautious in considering what purchases they can afford"". Several clothing chains have been struggling as the High Street faces tough competition from online retailers such as Asos. On Tuesday, fashion chain New Look reported a loss of Â£10.4m for the six months to 23 September, a marked reversal from the profit of Â£59.3m seen in the same period last year. UK like-for-like sales at the retailer fell 8.4%. Analysis: Emma Simpson, business correspondent It's been a pretty dismal month for non-food retailers, especially fashion. The warm weather won't have helped, but even so, these figures will be a concern as the all-important Christmas trading gets into gear. With prices rising faster than wages, consumers have less money to spend on non-essential items. Retailers are also grappling with the effects of a weaker pound as well as other cost pressures. That's on top of all the structural challenges, with the continuing shift to online. It's clear that the going's really challenging right now for a number of retailers.  Next has already warned of ""extremely volatile"" trading. The first real clue on how Christmas is shaping up will be Black Friday at the end of this month. Are shoppers merely holding back for a splurge and will some retailers now be forced to join the fray in order to shift stock at a discount to generate much-needed sales? ""The results reflect another tough period of trading for the company amid a challenging retail environment on the UK High Street,""said New Look executive chairman Alistair McGeorge,external, adding that ""the retailer is not anticipating a reversal in fortunes overnight."" Last week,Next reported,externalthat sales at its High Street stores had fallen by 7.7% in the year to 29  October, noting that ""sales performance has remained extremely volatile and is highly dependent on the seasonality of the weather"". Paul Martin, head of retail at the accountancy firm KPMG, said that October marked a ""reversal of fortunes for retailers"". He said: ""After a brief uptick, fashion sales reverted back to the dreary theme we have seen for a number of months this year. Unseasonably warm weather last month will not have helped, but this is unlikely to be the only reason the new ranges are proving unpopular."" Mr Martin said that retailers will be hoping that consumers are saving up for Black Friday, the post-Thanksgiving shopping bonanza in the US which has become a key date for retailers in the UK. This year it falls on 24 November, two days after the Budget. Ms Dickinson said that the Chancellor Philip Hammond should reflect on the ""disappointing state of play"" when he gives his speech on 22 November and ""deliver a Budget that allays the risks of a further slowdown in consumer spending, by keeping down the cost of living.  In other words, a shoppers' Budget.""

Johnson to ring Iran over jailed mum,"This video can not be played Mr Ratcliffe maintains his wife is innocent The husband of a British-Iranian woman, in prison in Iran, has urged Boris Johnson to retract his remark that she had been training journalists in Iran. Richard Ratcliffe said Iranian officials were using the foreign secretary's statement to justify extending his wife Nazanin's jail term. Mr Johnson has called his Iranian counterpart to clarify the situation. Liam Fox said his cabinet colleague's comment was a ""slip of the tongue"" but Labour said it was ""unacceptable"". Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe is serving a five-year sentence for allegedly plotting to topple the government in Tehran, although the official charges were never made public. Mr Ratcliffe maintains his wife's innocence, saying she was in Iran visiting family when she was arrested in 2016. She was summoned to court on Saturday where Mr Johnson's comment was cited as new evidence as to what she was doing in Iran. The Foreign Office said Mr Johnson now accepted he ""could have been clearer"" with his comments to the Foreign Affairs Committee. In a phone call to Iranian foreign minister Javad Zarif, Mr Johnson said that his remarks provided ""no justifiable basis"" for further legal action and he intended to visit Iran before the end of the year to discuss the case. Mr Zarif told the foreign secretary that the developments in the case over the weekend ""were unrelated"" to Mr Johnson's remarks, a Foreign Office statement added. Fears after Boris Johnson remark She was 'punished without a crime' Husband's plea for Briton held in Iran International Trade Secretary Liam Fox told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""We all make slips of the tongue"", adding on Sky News that it wasn't ""a serious gaffe"". But Labour's Tulip Siddiq, Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's MP, said it was ""unacceptable"" for Mr Johnson to ""lack a basic grasp on this important situation"". ""A slip of the tongue in my books is swearing in front of your child by mistake - it's not condemning a British citizen to an extra five years in prison,"" she said. Mr Ratcliffe told the BBC's Today programme that Mr Johnson should make a statement in the Commons, retracting what he said. He added the ""worst thing"" Mr Johnson could do now was ""suddenly go quiet and to create this problem without making any clarifications"". He said he still hoped his wife and young daughter would be back home in the UK for Christmas. This video can not be played Liam Fox tells BBC's Today that Boris Johnson's comment about Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was a ""slip of the tongue"" Former Conservative foreign secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind told the BBC Mr Johnson needed ""to concentrate more"" and ""get the detail right"". Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was sentenced to jail following a court hearing into whether she was attempting to overthrow the government. She denies all the allegations against her, but lost her final appeal in April. She has since faced two more charges relating to an accusation of plotting to topple the regime in Tehran. Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe has worked for the Thomson Reuters Foundation and the BBC, but insisted the 2016 visit was for her daughter to meet her grandparents. However, appearing before MPs on the House of Commons Foreign Affairs Select Committee last week, Mr Johnson appeared to contradict that. He criticised Iran over the case before saying: ""When I look at what Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe was doing, she was simply teaching people journalism, as I understand it. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe is serving a five-year sentence in Iran ""[Neither] Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe nor her family has been informed about what crime she has actually committed. And that I find extraordinary, incredible."" Four days later, Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was summoned to court where the foreign secretary's comments were cited as fresh evidence against her. At the hearing, she was accused of engaging in ""propaganda against the regime"". The Iranian judiciary's High Council for Human Rights said Mr Johnson's comments ""shed new light"" on the charity worker and proved Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe ""had visited the country for anything but a holiday"". Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe had been eligible for parole under the early release scheme from 23 November. However, Mr Ratcliffe told the Press Association that she could now face a fresh trial before that date to block her chance of freedom. ""I think the one thing the foreign secretary could do to make amends would be if he went to visit her in the next few weeks before her trial,"" he said. ""Careless talk has a cost and there's been a lot of careless talk."" Monique Villa, chief executive of the Thomson Reuters Foundation, called on Mr Johnson to ""immediately correct the serious mistake he made"".

Trump S Korea talks to focus on Pyongyang,"Mr Trump said he ""hoped to God"" he would not have to use the US' full military capabilities against Pyongyang US President Donald Trump has urged North Korea to ""come to the table"" and discuss giving up its nuclear weapons. Striking a different tone from previous fiery rhetoric, he said he ""hoped to God"" he did not have to use the US military against Pyongyang. Mr Trump was speaking at a press conference with his South Korean counterpart Moon Jae-in in Seoul, as part of his tour of Asia. The US leader haspreviously threatened ""fire and fury"" against Pyongyang. He is on a five-nation tour of Asia, where North Korea's nuclear ambitions have been high on his agenda. Trump vows to tackle N Korea on Asia trip N Korea: Where is the war of words heading? North Korea crisis explained in 300 words At a press conference, Mr Trump and Mr Moon reiterated their call for the North to denuclearise, with Mr Trump saying it ""makes sense for North Korea to come to the table"", and to ""do the right thing, not only for North Korea but for humanity all over the world"". Though the US had deployed a significant military presence in the region, he said he ""hoped to God"" he would not have to use it against North Korea. The two leaders also called on China and Russia to put pressure on Pyongyang, and said they were lifting the limit on South Korean missile payloads, which they had agreed to do in September. Mr Trump and Mr Moon held talks on Tuesday on trade and North Korea's nuclear programme Mr Trump also said that South Korea would be ordering ""billions of dollars"" in military equipment from the US, which he said would reduce their trade deficit. What has Trump said about your country? It was unclear if a deal was already struck, but Mr Moon said they had agreed to ""begin consultations on acquisitions"" that would enhance South Korea's defence capabilities. Mr Trump had earlier tweeted that""massive military and energy orders"" from Japan were also happening,external, and claimed on Monday thatJapan could shoot down Pyongyang's missiles with US equipment. Japan's leader Shinzo Abe said earlier that he was considering it. This video can not be played How could war with North Korea unfold? Though the US president will only spend about 24 hours in South Korea, it is perhaps the most symbolic stop in his Asian tour, says the BBC's Robin Brant in Seoul. The trip is designed to bolster the military alliance that has long protected South Korea, and strength in unity is the message they want to send to North Korean leader Kim Jong-un just across the border, says our correspondent. But the two leaders also have their differences. Mr Trump haspreviously accused Mr Moon's government of trying to appease the North,external. He has also previously criticised the free trade agreement between the US and South Korea, and has made clear he wants to re-negotiate its terms. Mr Trump, during the press conference, said the deal had been ""quite unsuccessful"" for the US, and that the two countries were going to ""pursue a much better deal"".

Growth up: Now get set for the Budget,"They are not exactly hanging out the bunting at the Treasury, but today's better-than-expected economic growth figures have put a bit of a spring in the step of the chancellor. And that is not just for economic reasons. Philip Hammond is under increasing political pressure from cabinet colleagues to loosen the purse strings in his Budget on 22 November. Sajid Javid, the communities secretary, has gone public, suggesting that the government should borrow more for housebuilding. And another senior cabinet minister I spoke to, with excellent knowledge of the prime minister's thinking, also suggested to me that some fiscal largesse might be just what the country needs. Philip Hammond is not of that view - and the better economic data will give him a little more headroom in the public finances without having to borrow more. His hand has been strengthened. In his interview with me, Mr Hammond made it clear that he remains a fiscal conservative, focused on ""balancing the books"" and bringing the deficit down to zero by the middle of the next decade. I asked him whether he saw any merit in delay. ""Well, we've already moved the target for balancing the books out from 2020 to 2025, but continuing to drive down the deficit in a measured and sensible way over a period of years, so that we are living within our means, and reducing the debt we are passing on to our children, has to be the right way to go,"" Mr Hammond told me. There is certainly a robust argument going on in government. There are those who believe that Mrs May's administration needs some eye-catching initiatives. And given that tax rises are difficult to push through Parliament (just remember what happened to those March plans to increase National Insurance contributions for the self-employed), borrowing more seems the easiest route to paying for popular policies. Should we borrow to build? Many economists believe that the present deficit of 2.6% is low enough to satisfy the markets that the government is fiscally competent and has public debts under a modicum of control. And Mr Javid said that ""taking advantage of record low interest rates can be the right thing if done sensibly"". That does not appear to be the view of Mr Hammond. ""The government's borrowing costs are not at record low levels, they've risen over the last six or eight months,"" he said. That's because higher inflation has increased the cost of servicing the government's debt. ""But the most important point here is that we still have a very large deficit and we have a debt which is 90% of our national income. That leaves us very exposed to any future shocks to the economy. ""So we want to continue to get the deficit down in a measured and sensible way over the medium term, giving ourselves room to support the economy, support our public services, invest in Britain's future through productivity-stimulating investment, but still moving over time to get that deficit down and starting to see our debt shrinking as a share of our GDP, so we don't simply pass on an unsupportable debt to the next generation."" The government's approach to borrowing will be a vital to the tone and feel of the Budget. As far as Mr Hammond is concerned, ""living within our means"" is still the key message he wants to emanate from the Treasury.

"Woman fired for making gesture at TrumpJuli Briskman, 50, showed the president's motorcade the middle finger while cycling in Virginia.12h12 hours agoUS & Canada","Despite losing her job, the 50-year-old says she does not regret ""flipping off"" the motorcade A woman pictured raising her middle finger toward US President Donald Trump's motorcade has reportedly been fired from her job over the photograph. The image went viral after it was taken on 28 October in Virginia, close to a Trump golf resort. Juli Briskman, who was identified as the cyclist in the image, alleges she was fired by employers Akima LLC after she posted it to her online profiles. The company did not respond to the BBC's request for comment. Ms Briskman told US media the firm had called her into a meeting a day after she informed their HR department she was the subject of the widely circulated image. She told the Huffington Post news website that executives had told her they classified the image as ""lewd"" or ""obscene"",external, and therefore deemed that it violated their social media policies after she had posted it to her Twitter and Facebook accounts. However Ms Briskman said she had emphasised to management that she had not been in working hours when the photograph was taken and had not mentioned her employers on the social media pages. A year later: Liberals still haunted by Trump win Twitter employee 'deactivated' Trump account on last day Ms Briskman also alleges that a male colleague was allowed to keep his job after deleting a post deemed as offensive in a separate incident. She therefore questions why she was immediately dismissed from her role. The 50-year-old mother-of-two had reportedly been at the government contractor firm for six months working in communications. Motorcade protests are not uncommon: this was taken by press photographer Brendan Smialowski on the same day Despite losing her job, Ms Briskman said she did not regret making the gesture. 'I lost my job over a Facebook post' ""In some ways, I'm doing better than ever,""she told The Huffington Post,external ""I'm angry about where our country is right now. I am appalled. This was an opportunity for me to say something."" The press photographer,Brendan Smialowski, told the AFP website that it was common to see people protesting or making obscene gestures at presidents,externalas they drove by. He said that he had been struck by the ""tenacity"" of Ms Briskman after she made the gesture several times and made attempts to catch up with the motorcade.

The drone has a specialist night scope and thermal cameras which zoo staff searching for her hope will help pinpoint her location. So far Lilleth has evaded police helicopters, tracking devices and traps. Staff said the lynx's brother Tyrion, who also lives at the zoo, has been pining for her every night and calling out to her. Lynx 'leapt' over electrified zoo fence Call for landowners to host wild lynx in Wales Lynx reintroduction: 'Five sites interested' in Wales The zoo will remain closed while the search continues. Zoo owner Tracy Tweedy, 46, said: ""The hunt for Lilleth continues and every day we are getting closer and closer. ""We have been working day and night towards recovering her safely and we are building up an accurate map of her movements around the zoo. ""We have built lots of large bait traps in situ around the grounds and have spotters out looking for her at all times. ""She is very hard to follow as some of the terrain is almost impassable for people and it's quite easy for her to slip by unseen. ""We have even been following her after dark using night scopes and a thermal imaging camera on a high flying drone."" A photograph taken by a night vision camera showed Lilleth standing next to a cage baited with food Ceredigion council said it was working closely with the Welsh Government and Dyfed-Powys Police and that ""every possible measure is being considered in relation to the capture of the animal"". ""The emphasis has been on inciting it into one of a number of cages and professional advice will be sought to ensure that this is being done in such a manner so as to have maximum effect,"" a council spokesman said. When the animal is recaptured, he said advice will be sought as to ""the most appropriate measures for its future"". He said the council will be carrying out an inspection of the zoo ""in the presence of an approved veterinary surgeon who specialises in the cat family"".

More than 130 Grenfell families in hotels,"More than 130 families left homeless by the Grenfell Tower fire are living in emergency housing, MPs have heard. Communities Secretary Sajid Javid said Kensington and Chelsea Council's response in the aftermath of the fire had been ""sluggish and chaotic"". It comes as the Grenfell taskforce produced a report into the fire, which saidthe council ""failed its community"" on 14 June,external. Council leader Elizabeth Campbell said it had ""huge"" amounts of work to do. Speaking in the Commons, Mr Javid said residents had been ""failed by a system that allowed the fire to happen"" and then failed again in the aftermath. He said efforts to rehouse victims had been ""painfully slow"" - with just 26 out of 204 Grenfell Tower and Grenfell Walk families given permanent accommodation so far. He said 122 households had accepted an offer of temporary or permanent accommodation, and 73 had moved in to new homes. The taskforce said residents were ""hesitating to accept rehousing offers"" because they did not want to lose benefits. Currently, former residents of Grenfell Tower and Grenfell Walk have their rent, utility bills and council tax suspended for the first 12 months of moving into temporary or permanent accommodation. The council said this created a ""financial cliff edge, which the tenants can avoid by remaining in their emergency accommodation"". Some residents see the rent-free period as wasted on temporary homes, it said. It voted to extend the rent-free period until summer 2019 in a bid to remove ""unintended disincentives"". This video can not be played Marcio and Andreia Gomes tell the story of how they managed to escape the fire The Grenfell taskforce,set up in the aftermath of the fire, has spent nine weeks looking at the recovery process run by the council. ""The report pulls no punches about the fact that there is still significant room for improvement,"" Mr Javid said. It said 320 families altogether - including not only former residents but also those living in Grenfell's vicinity - were still living in hotels. The report, written by housing and local government experts appointed by the government, said the council needed to work more quickly, and cited accounts of ""poor treatment"" towards victims. It said many staff did their best to help but there was a leadership vacuum and a distant council that did not know its residents. The report's authors met survivors, concluding that many victims felt no-one was listening to their concerns. It nevertheless praised Kensington and Chelsea for ""working hard to develop effective support and services to victims and survivors"". Since the fire, many of those at the top of the council have quit, includingleader Nick Paget-Brownandchief executive Nicholas Holgate. The Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea said it ""entirely"" accepted all the taskforce's recommendations and would offer new homes to ""all those who want to leave"" emergency accommodation by December. Mrs Campbell said the local authority had ""huge amounts of work to do"" and understood the need to change. But the report criticised its lack of urgency, saying: ""As the council tries to do everything at once, it is doing everything too slowly."" It accused council members of lacking a ""firm grasp"" of the true scale of the recovery operation - saying some believed that ""in a few months' time everything shall return to the way it used to be"". It said it was ""disappointing"" that the tower, which is currently a crime scene,had not yet been covered, urging scaffold work to be completed with ""greater haste"". This video can not be played Why did it take so long to get an aerial platform to the tower block? BBC Newsnight investigates It said visible remains of the burnt-out tower ""cast a shadow"" over the entire area. ""Any extended delays will further add to the ongoing trauma that the community is living with,"" the report said. Mr Javid suggested a number of ways the council could improve - including increasing the pace of their work and the need for ""greater empathy and emotional intelligence"" towards victims.

"Fears for jailed mum after Johnson remarkForeign secretary's comments could double Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe's Iran jail term, says charity.9h9 hours agoUK","Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe is serving a five-year sentence in Iran A charity fears a British-Iranian woman held in Iran could have her prison sentence doubled following remarks made by the foreign secretary. Boris Johnson told a Commons committee that Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who was arrested at Tehran Airport in 2016, was ""teaching people journalism"". The Thomson Reuters Foundation said she was seeing family and urged Mr Johnson to correct his ""serious mistake"". The Foreign Office said the remarks could not justify new charges. Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe is currently serving a five-year sentence after Iran tried her on charges of trying to overthrow the government. She denies all the allegations against her. Shelost her final appeal in April 2017but has since faced two more charges relating to an accusation of plotting to topple the regime in Tehran. Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe has worked for the Thomson Reuters Foundation and BBC Media Action (the corporation's international development charity), but insisted the 2016 visit was for her daughter to meet her grandparents. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson appeared before MPs last Wednesday Mr Johnson was appearing before MPs on the House of Commons Foreign Affairs Select Committee on 1 November, and criticised Iran over the case before saying: ""When I look at what Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe was doing, she was simply teaching people journalism as I understand it. ""[Neither] Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe nor her family has been informed about what crime she has actually committed. And that I find extraordinary, incredible."" Husband's plea for Briton held in Iran 'She was punished without crime' Four days later, Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was summoned to court where the foreign secretary's comments were cited as evidence against her. At this hearing she was accused of engaging in ""propaganda against the regime"". The Iranian judiciary's High Council for Human Rights said Mr Johnson's comments ""shed new light"" on the charity worker and proved Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe ""had visited the country for anything but a holiday"". Monique Villa, chief executive of the Thomson Reuters Foundation,called on Mr Johnson,externalto ""immediately correct the serious mistake he made"". Thomson Reuters Foundation says the comments ""can only worsen her sentence"" Ms Villa said there was a ""direct correlation"" between Mr Johnson's comments and the unscheduled court appearance. ""This accusation from Judge Salavati can only worsen her sentence. She is obviously a bargaining chip between the UK government and Iran and this injustice must stop as soon as possible. ""Whatever is at stake should be paid attention to by the UK government."" Labour's Tulip Siddiq, the MP for Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's constituency, said she is ""furious"" with Mr Johnson and called on him to ""urgently retract"" his remarks. A Foreign Office spokesman said the remarks ""provide no justifiable basis"" to bring further charges against Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe. ""While criticising the Iranian case against Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe, the Foreign Secretary sought to explain that even the most extreme set of unproven Iranian allegations against her were insufficient reason for her detention and treatment. ""The UK will continue to do all it can to secure her release on humanitarian grounds and the foreign secretary will be calling the Iranian foreign minister to raise again his serious concerns about the case and ensure his remarks are not misrepresented.""

Welsh 'Tourette's jibe' worker suspendedA Greggs bakery employee is suspended for allegedly comparing Welsh speech to Tourette syndrome.9h9 hours agoMid Wales,"The shop is on Lampeter's High St A Greggs bakery worker has been suspended after he allegedly told a customer who ordered in Welsh the language sounded ""like Tourette's"". Sioned Howells, 18, reported the incident in Lampeter, Ceredigion, on her Twitter account. She tweeted the employee said: ""That was Welsh?? Sounded more like you had tourettes to me.""

Osian Rhys, vice chairman of the Welsh language campaign group, Cymdeithas yr Iaith, said the incident ""is terrible if true"". ""It's happened, not just because of the attitude of one member of staff, but also partly because the language legislation doesn't cover private businesses,"" he said.

Two boys die after car hits classroomPolice in Sydney say they do not believe the crash was intentional.1h43 minutes agoAustralia,"Police investigate the crash in the Sydney suburb of Greenacre Two eight-year-old boys have died after a car crashed into a primary school classroom in Sydney, police have said. The incident at Banksia Road Public School also left three girls in hospital with injuries. Most of the other 19 children in the classroom were assessed at the scene by paramedics, authorities said.

"Woman fired for making gesture at TrumpJuli Briskman, 50, showed the president's motorcade the middle finger while cycling in Virginia.10h10 hours agoUS & Canada","Despite losing her job, the 50-year-old says she does not regret ""flipping off"" the motorcade A woman pictured raising her middle finger toward US President Donald Trump's motorcade has reportedly been fired from her job over the photograph. The image went viral after it was taken on 28 October in Virginia, close to a Trump golf resort. Juli Briskman, who was identified as the cyclist in the image, alleges she was fired by employers Akima LLC after she posted it to her online profiles. The company did not respond to the BBC's request for comment. Ms Briskman told US media the firm had called her into a meeting a day after she informed their HR department she was the subject of the widely circulated image. She told the Huffington Post news website that executives had told her they classified the image as ""lewd"" or ""obscene"",external, and therefore deemed that it violated their social media policies after she had posted it to her Twitter and Facebook accounts. However Ms Briskman said she had emphasised to management that she had not been in working hours when the photograph was taken and had not mentioned her employers on the social media pages. A year later: Liberals still haunted by Trump win Twitter employee 'deactivated' Trump account on last day Ms Briskman also alleges that a male colleague was allowed to keep his job after deleting a post deemed as offensive in a separate incident. She therefore questions why she was immediately dismissed from her role. The 50-year-old mother-of-two had reportedly been at the government contractor firm for six months working in communications. Motorcade protests are not uncommon: this was taken by press photographer Brendan Smialowski on the same day Despite losing her job, Ms Briskman said she did not regret making the gesture. 'I lost my job over a Facebook post' ""In some ways, I'm doing better than ever,""she told The Huffington Post,external ""I'm angry about where our country is right now. I am appalled. This was an opportunity for me to say something."" The press photographer,Brendan Smialowski, told the AFP website that it was common to see people protesting or making obscene gestures at presidents,externalas they drove by. He said that he had been struck by the ""tenacity"" of Ms Briskman after she made the gesture several times and made attempts to catch up with the motorcade.

Man jailed for 'I've got acid' attackMax Kelly squirted a bottle of cleaning solution at two men following a row near a pub.6h6 hours agoBirmingham & Black Country,"Max Kelly, 23, has been jailed for a total of six months A man has been jailed for a roadside ""acid"" attack when he squirted a bottle of cleaning solution at two others. Max Kelly was a passenger in a BMW being driven by his friend when a row broke out near a pub in Solihull. The 23-year-old, now of Evesham, Worcestershire, got out of the car and shouted ""I've got acid"", before spraying the liquid at the men. He was sentenced to a total of six months in jail and ordered to pay his victims Â£500 compensation. The confrontation was sparked on 18 July after one of the men drinking outside the pub, Robert Robinson, told the driver of the BMW to slow down after he saw the vehicle being driven erratically. At an earlier hearing, Benjamin Prentice admitted a public order offence in connection with the confrontation Kelly, a father-of-one expecting his second child, then asked him: ""What did you say?"" before leaving the car and carrying out the attack. Mr Robinson stripped off in the street after being hit by the liquid, such was his fear of injury after a spate of well-publicised attacks across the UK. The other victim, David Hobson, an off-duty firefighter, described the liquid as smelling like ""ammonia"" and desperately tried to clean it off after he was hit. Jailing Kelly at Birmingham Magistrates' Court, chairman of magistrates Ann Brown told him he had shown little remorse and added his actions ""could not be taken for granted"". Kelly, who had been found guilty of two counts of common assault at an earlier trial, replied: ""I understand."" The car's driver, Benjamin Prentice, of Hexton Close, Solihull, was fined Â£140 at an earlier hearing after admitting a public order offence in connection with the incident.

"Gibbons saved from pet trade have babyRescued pet apes in Indonesia are being returned to the wild, but traders still ""flouting the law"".12m12 minutes agoScience & Environment","This video can not be played The arrival of the new baby gibbon provides hope for the future of this endangered species Conservationists are celebrating the arrival of a baby Javan gibbon - the first of this species to be born in the wild to parents that were rescued from the pet trade. Conservation International says the birth is a boost for the future of the apes on the Indonesian island of Java. But illegal trade is still a threat, and is increasingly moving online. A UK-based investigation this year,externalrevealed that the law protecting these ape species was being openly ""flouted"". Researchers who carried out the investigation, who are based at Oxford Brookes University, also showed BBC News videos of protected species being advertised by pet traders on social media platforms. The birth of the wild-born Javan gibbon - in a protected forest in West Java - is a breakthrough for a project that has now released 17 of the apes into the area. Conservation International (CI) and the Javan Gibbon Foundation have rehabilitated the animals, and rangers now patrol the site at Mount Malabar daily, monitoring the animals and checking for any poaching activity. It has taken almost 10 years to bring the two adults back to the forest. ""It's a long, long process,"" explained Anton Ario from CI. ""Because the poachers that take gibbons for the trade target the babies - because they're cute and easy to sell - when we find them, they're often living in a cage and cannot move around at all. They need to learn to live in the trees."" To ensure their rereleased animals are able to survive, they introduce them to potential mates while they are still in captivity - ultimately releasing pairs or family groups of the animals. The new birth represents hope for a primate that is rapidly losing its habitat in Java, which has less than 5% of pristine forest left in its steep, tropical mountains. But while programmes like this can get a few animals back to the wild every year, many more are being bought and sold as pets. Young orangutans are targeted by the illegal pet trade A search on social media channels will reveal pet shops and sellers - many based in South East Asia - openly advertising pet baby gibbons for sale. ""They are flouting the law,"" says Prof Vincent Nijman, from Oxford Brookes University, who has carried out investigations of the illegal trade in endangered apes. Researchers monitoring the trade showed us pictures and videos of gibbons being advertised for sale on social media platforms, including Facebook and Instagram ""No-one is being punished. ""So if people [entering the forest] come across a baby gibbon and have the option to capture it, they are motivated to do it. It represents money and doesn't represent any risk."" The trade is not confined to gibbons. Critically endangered orangutans and slow lorises are also being ""plucked"" from the wild. Prof Nijman's recently published investigation revealed that, while more than 400 illegal pet orangutans had been seized by law enforcement in Indonesia in the last two decades, those confiscations had led to only seven prosecutions. Rescued apes have to be rehabilitated by conservationists, who help them learn to return to the trees after life in a cage BBC News reported a post to Facebook that advertised a baby gibbon for sale. In response, the company said it had removed the post and was ""investigating the page where it was posted"". ""We're committed to helping tackle the illegal online trade of protected wildlife and will remove any content that violates our community standards when it is reported to us,"" Facebook said in a statement. Instagram has also responded after the BBC alerted it to the sale of gibbons on the site. In a statement sent to BBC News, the company said that the accounts in question had been removed, adding that the illegal trade or sale of animals was ""prohibited on Instagram"". Prof Nijman pointed out that the numerous threats to endangered apes in Indonesia were not all problems that people had the power to tackle. ""Orangutans in particular face threats left, right and centre,"" he said, ""But curbing the pet trade is within our control. ""It's in human hands to fix this.""

Facebook Messenger payments comes to UKUsers will be able to use the popular messaging app to send and receive money.8h8 hours agoTechnology,"A virtual shower of money accompanies successful payments Facebook has chosen the UK as the first country outside the US to get its Messenger payments service. Later on Monday, local users will be able to send each other money in a message. The service was launched in the US in 2015. The social network says it has been widely used to split restaurant bills, pay babysitters and simply send gifts. It says most users send less than $50 (Â£38). The company says the service is coming to the UK because it has so many ""mobile-savvy consumers"". Facebook is collaborating with all the major banks and credit card firms to launch Messenger payments, which will require both the sender and recipient of money to register their payment cards. But three years ago, UK banks launched their own instant payments service - Paym - which has not made a huge impact on the way we pay. So, why should this be any different? Facebook claims Messenger payments will catch on because ""people are looking for simplicity and emotion"". I'm not sure about the emotion, but the Messenger app is certainly a very simple way to send money, especially compared with Paym where you have to log in to your own bank's app. Smartphones have helped to enable quick and easy contactless payments David Marcus, who runs Messenger, says it is obvious from our messages that we need this. ""More and more people are having conversations on Messenger about paying one another,"" he explains. ""As a result it's a very natural place for you to have the most frictionless and secure way of paying each other."" Facebook is also introducing something called M suggestions, a virtual assistant that recognises when you are talking about payments. It will suggest the new service as a quick and easy solution. We'll see how users enjoy being nudged in this manner. But with millions of Messenger users, who will not need to download a separate app to use the service, Facebook is well placed to become major player in the UK payments scene. That begs the question, how did UK banks let this happen? A spokesman for Paym insisted it was growing, with four million people having registered their mobile phone numbers to use the service. But with just Â£400m of payments in three and a half years, it is still a minnow. What's easier? Cash, or a digital payment? In Sweden, by contrast, Swish - a peer-to-peer payments service in a single app - has taken the country by storm with the majority of adults now ""swishing"" money to each other and small businesses. The UK payments industry decided against a Paym app, believing customers would be more likely to trust their own bank's online operation. But it looks as though the lesson from Sweden - and from Facebook - is that simplicity is vital to building the network effect needed to make a new service take off. But perhaps we should be cautious before allowing Facebook into yet another part of our lives. While the Messenger service is free to use, the business model behind it is all about ""engagement"" - keeping users on the platform for longer so that they can be served more advertising. At a time when there is growing alarm over the extraordinary power the social media giant has to mould the way we see the world, letting it peer into our wallets as well may be a step too far for some.

The High Street struggling to survive,"Rotherham town centre's shop vacancy rate stands at about 23% As the latest retail industry figures show a sharp slowdown in non-food retail sales, we take a look at the problems one High Street in Rotherham is facing. There's an early morning bustle at Fitzwilliam & Hughes, a Rotherham cafe overlooking the Minster and its gardens. It's a corner plot in a listed building, it feels like a choice spot, but co-owner Matthew Leather is glum about the town. ""So many businesses have come and gone in the three or four years we've been here. There isn't the footfall or the attractions in Rotherham so they've not been able to last. If I didn't have a business in Rotherham I wouldn't come because there's nothing to attract you."" Rotherham Borough Council says it's working on that. A masterplan includes a new area called Forge Island with bars, restaurants, apartments and a cinema down by the river and construction has started on a new university campus. The council's regeneration director Damien Wilson says it's aiming to bring ""more investment and more people living, working and socialising in the town centre - it's a long-term plan"". Jamie Oliver's Ministry of Food unit closed earlier this year Unemployment is higher than the national average at 5.6% and the town centre's shop vacancy rate stands at about 23% - that's nearly a quarter of the retail space. Non-food sales in slowest growth on record How a family shop has lasted 150 years The main pedestrianised retail area has the usual mix of national names, banks, bookies, vaping shops and ""To Let"" signs. There's even Jamie Oliver's Ministry of Food unit, which launched as a healthy eating project on the back of a TV series, but it closed this year and stands empty, next to another vacant unit. The big retailers are conspicuous in their absence. Primark is leaving the High Street for the out-of-town Parkgate Shopping Park which is also home to M&S and Next. Chris Hamby, who sells shoes and antiques in the High Street and rents several other shops, is enthusiastic about Rotherham's potential but he says the town needs those big retail names. ""People like independent shops but you need a lot of crumbs to make a cake, you need a lot of people to come. ""As towns are evolving and changing you'll see a big store go and a shop will open selling a few candles, or a supermarket will go and someone will come selling dreamcatchers. That's not a town - we need the big retailers back."" Independent shopkeepers have long since complained that pressure from business rates has left them on the edge. A revaluation in April pushed up bills in some parts of the country, but in Rotherham rateable values fell by 2% on average. Andrew Roddison is one of those who's benefitted. His Whistle Stop Sweet Shop and Temperance Bar in the Imperial Buildings now qualifies for full rates relief, and it's made a big difference. ""Some months the money wasn't there so for us - and a lot of businesses locally - it was a head scratching time as to whether you can afford to stay open. Now that pressure's gone it does make a difference, it allows you to invest and bring in new lines that will hopefully attract people."" Yella owner Dannii Paston says some landlords are 'out of touch' with what shops are making Dannii Paston, who runs clothing and gift shop Yella Brick Road on the High Street, doesn't pay rates and is happy with her rent, but she thinks ""ridiculous"" rent demands from some landlords are the fundamental reason behind empty units. ""It's as if they're out of touch with what people are taking through the tills. In general the council-owned buildings are full and the ones that are empty are private landlords. ""A lot of them don't live around here so they've got no idea of the feeling, and the customers. They might live in London and think, 'I'm not reducing it from Â£20,000, that's cheap'."" She's also noticed the impact of the Brexit vote. ""It was strange, like a switch. When Brexit was voted in, it just went down, I can't really explain why that might be. ""We lost a member of staff because of it, and three of our suppliers are in Europe so the exchange rate really affected us. For us it was the pound, I don't know what it could be with the customers. Maybe they were worrying and tightened their belts."" Holy Ghost Tattoo Collective owner Emily Dawson says parking is too expensive It's Friday lunchtime and the Holy Ghost Tattoo Collective is busy with people getting tattoos and piercings. ""We're doing really well, I think we're probably one of the few that are thriving in Rotherham,"" says owner Emily Dawson. But she thinks some of the town's problems are linking to one perennial problem. ""They need to focus on parking, that's a big issue, because it's very expensive to park when there's not a lot to offer other than our independent shops, which are amazing."" Many of the problems Rotherham's shops are facing are mirrored in towns across the UK and the solutions are not immediately obvious. As the council's regeneration director Damien Wilson says ""change will not happen overnight"".

Higher prices drive retail sales growth,"Higher prices for food and clothing prices driven up by the weak pound fuelled retail sales growth last month. British Retail Consortium (BRC) and KPMG figures showed that like-for-like retail sales rose 1.9% in September That was far higher than the 0.4% increase for the same month last year. Total sales climbed 2.3%. Much of this growth was due to price rises filtering through, particularly in food and clothing, said BRC chief executive Helen Dickinson. ""Retailers have worked hard to keep a lid on price rises following the depreciation of the pound, but with a potent mix of more expensive imports and increasing business costs from various government policies, something had to give at some point,"" she said. ""Spending is still being focused towards essential purchases; with consumers buying their winter coats and back to school items, but shying away from big ticket items such as furniture and delaying the renewal of key household electrical goods."" The survey showed that food sales rose by 2.5% on a like-for-like basis over the three months to September and 3.5% in total, while non-food sales rose by just 0.5%, or by 0.9% on a total basis. Non-food sales in stores slumped 2% last month, and slid by 1.5% in total in the three months to September. Yet online sales for non-food surged 10.7% in September - well above the three-month average of 10% - as shoppers responded well to online discounts. Paul Martin, KPMG UK's head of retail, said: ""With potential interest rate rises on the horizon, shaky consumer confidence and ever-increasing levels of household debt, uncertainty remains. ""We're now moving into the final quarter, which will ultimately define whether 2017 has been a good or bad year for retailers.""

"Air Force 'failed' to flag Texas shooterThe gunman's past criminal conviction was not entered into the US database, officials believe.1ma minute agoUS & Canada","Kelley is believed to have been in a family row with his ex-wife and in-laws, police say The US Air Force has said it is investigating its apparent failure to enter information about Texas gunman Devin Patrick Kelley's criminal history into the national database. Ex-airman Kelley was court-martialled for domestic violence in 2012, and was barred from owning or buying guns. But last year he was able to purchase a rifle he used in Sunday's attack on a small church outside San Antonio. He killed 26 people and fled the scene. He was later found dead in his car. Police said he died from what appeared to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound after being chased by armed bystanders. Kelley was also shot in his leg and torso by a citizen, the regional director for the Texas Department of Public Safety, Freeman Martin, was quoted as saying by the Associated Press. The small town where everyone knows a victim Why are US mass shootings getting more deadly? In a statement, the Air Force said: ""Initial information indicates that [Devin] Kelley's domestic violence offense was not entered into the National Criminal Information Center database by the Holloman Air Force Base Office of Special Investigations."" This video can not be played How the Texas church mass shooting unfolded It said it was now - together with the Department of Defense - investigating the handling of Kelley's criminal records. Texas Governor Greg Abbott earlier said Kelley, 26, should not legally have been allowed to own a firearm, after having been denied a gun owner's permit by the state. Kelley bought the rifle from the Academy Sports + Outdoors shop in San Antonio. The store issued a statement sending ""deep condolences"" to the victims' families. Kelley was armed with the semi-automatic rifle and two pistols when he attacked the First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs during Sunday services. He had argued with his mother-in-law before the rampage, officials said. Kelley called his father after he was shot by an armed bystander and said he did not think he would survive. This video can not be played 'Our kids play together,' says a resident whose neighbours are feared dead ""This was not racially motivated, it wasn't over religious beliefs,"" said Mr Martin. ""There was a domestic situation going on with the family and in-laws,"" he said, adding that Kelley had sent threatening texts to his mother-in-law. ""We know that he expressed anger towards his mother-in-law, who attends this church,"" Mr Martin added. Twenty-six crosses were put in a field in Sutherland Spring - one cross for each of the victims On Monday evening, a vigil was held in Sutherland Springs. In one corner of the field, music played, people prayed, and hundreds of people held their hands in the air, the BBC's Owen Amos reports. In another, a floodlight illuminated 26 crosses - one for each person shot dead. Johnnie Langendorff (second right) and another man chased the shooter out of town Standing at the back, a feather in his cowboy hat, was Johnnie Langendorff - one of two men who chased the shooter out of town. People queued to shake Mr Langendorff's hand. At one point, a couple embraced him, and they stood in prayer for two or three minutes, our correspondent says. Wilson County Sheriff Joe Tackitt said between 12 and 14 children were among those killed in the attack in Sutherland Springs, a small town 30 miles (50km) south-east of the city of San Antonio. The youngest of those who died was only a year old. This video can not be played 'Belle died with her church family,' her mother said As many as eight members of the Holcombe family were killed in the shooting,the Washington Post reported,external. The BBC spoke to the Holcombes' neighbour Pauline Garza, who said the family did not come back from church. Sutherland Springs: The victims America's gun culture in 10 charts The First Baptist Church's pastor, Frank Pomeroy, told US media his 14-year-old daughter, Annabelle, was among those killed. Twenty people were also wounded. Kelley was court-martialled in 2012 after he was accused of assault against his wife and step-son. He was sentenced to 12 months' confinement. He received a ""bad conduct"" discharge two years later, according to Ann Stefanek, a US Air Force spokeswoman. Who was Sutherland Springs gunman? Gov Abbott said: ""It's clear this is a person who had violent tendencies, who had some challenges, and someone who was a powder keg, seeming waiting to go off."" Kelley worked till last July as a security guard for an amusement park run by the Schlitterbahn company in New Braunfels near Sutherland Springs. His employment was ""terminated"" after just over five weeks, the company said. He had a licence to work as an unarmed security guard, a job that police described as ""similar to a security guard at a concert-type situation"". ""There were no disqualifiers entered into the national crime information database to preclude him from receiving a private security licence,"" police said.

Patel apologises for Israeli meetingsPriti Patel was on holiday when she met the Israeli PM - but did not tell the Foreign Office.8h8 hours agoUK Politics,"The international development secretary held 12 unofficial meetings in Israel Priti Patel has apologised for holding a series of undisclosed meetings with senior Israeli officials during a private holiday over the summer. The international development secretary met Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other senior figures without ""following the usual procedures"". Ms Patel apologised,externalfor not informing the Foreign Office and suggesting Boris Johnson knew in advance of the visit. Labour said the ""shocking"" admission warranted a Cabinet Office inquiry. Kuenssberg: A bad day at the office for Theresa May Downing Street said it welcomed Ms Patel's ""clarification"" and that at a meeting with Theresa May earlier, the prime minister had ""reminded her of the obligations which exist under the ministerial code"". No 10 said it had not been aware of Ms Patel's meeting with Mr Netanyahu until Friday but insisted that Mrs May still had confidence in the minister. The BBC's diplomatic correspondent James Landale said there were clear rules about what ministers could and could not do and ""in normal circumstances"" Ms Patel would be in ""serious trouble"". But he said the fragility of Mrs May's government and the fact that the PM would not want to lose another cabinet minister after Sir Michael Fallon's recent resignation could help her. The BBC revealed on Friday that Ms Patel held a number of undisclosed meetings with business and political figures during a family holiday in August, including Yair Lapid, the leader of Israel's centrist Yesh Atid party and Jean Judes, executive director of disability charity BIS. No diplomats were present at the meetings, at which the minister was accompanied by an influential pro-Israeli Conservative peer and campaigner Lord Polak. Ms Patel, who is a long-standing supporter of Israel and a former vice-chairman of Conservative Friends of Israel defended her actions, saying she had paid for the holiday herself and while in Israel had taken the opportunity to meet ""people and organisations"" for the purpose of building links between the two countries. She also told the Guardian,externalthat ""Boris [Johnson] knew about the visit, the point is that the Foreign Office did know about this"". Suggesting that the reaction to her visit had been ""extraordinary"", she added that it was ""for the Foreign Office to go away and explain themselves"". But in a statement ""clarifying her position"", Ms Patel said she had in fact attended 12 meetings, not just the handful previously reported, and that her earlier comments may have ""implied"" otherwise. Among meetings that were not previously reported, she said that she had met Mr Netanyahu to discuss his forthcoming visit to the UK as well as the Israeli ""domestic political scene"" and UK-Israeli collaboration. Ms Patel discussed Benjamin Netanyahu's visit to the UK She said she had also met other senior figures in the Israeli government, including security minister Gilad Erdan and foreign ministry official Yuval Rotem. Ms Patel has also set the record straight about when the government was informed about the trip. While the Foreign Office was aware of the visit ""while it was under way"", she said she was wrong to have given the impression that the department and Mr Johnson knew about it in advance. She said she ""regretted the lack of precision in the wording"" of her previous statement about the trip. ""This summer I travelled to Israel, on a family holiday paid for myself,"" she said in a statement. ""While away I had the opportunity to meet a number of people and organisations...In hindsight, I can see how my enthusiasm to engage in this way could be mis-read, and how meetings were set up and reported in a way which did not accord with the usual procedures. I am sorry for this and I apologise for it. ""My first and only aim as the Secretary of State for International Development is to put the interests of British taxpayers and the world's poor at the front of our development work."" In her statement, Ms Patel also said the Foreign Office was clear that the UK's interests were ""not damaged or affected"" by her actions. Labour has called for an inquiry into whether Ms Patel broke the ministerial code or the rules on lobbying. ""Not only does it look like she has broken the ministerial code, she has now been caught misleading the British public,"" shadow international development secretary Kate Osamor said. ""If she does not now resign, then Theresa May must immediately refer the issue to the Cabinet Office for a full investigation."" Downing Street said the ministerial code was ""not explicit"" in this area and Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heyward had been asked to see if it could be made clearer.

Osian Rhys, vice chairman of the Welsh language campaign group, Cymdeithas yr Iaith, said the incident ""is terrible if true"".

Man jailed for 'I've got acid' attackMax Kelly squirted a bottle of cleaning solution at two men following a row near a pub.5h5 hours agoBirmingham & Black Country,"Max Kelly, 23, has been jailed for a total of six months A man has been jailed for a roadside ""acid"" attack when he squirted a bottle of cleaning solution at two others. Max Kelly was a passenger in a BMW being driven by his friend when a row broke out near a pub in Solihull. The 23-year-old, now of Evesham, Worcestershire, got out of the car and shouted ""I've got acid"", before spraying the liquid at the men. He was sentenced to a total of six months in jail and ordered to pay his victims Â£500 compensation. The confrontation was sparked on 18 July after one of the men drinking outside the pub, Robert Robinson, told the driver of the BMW to slow down after he saw the vehicle being driven erratically. At an earlier hearing, Benjamin Prentice admitted a public order offence in connection with the confrontation Kelly, a father-of-one expecting his second child, then asked him: ""What did you say?"" before leaving the car and carrying out the attack. Mr Robinson stripped off in the street after being hit by the liquid, such was his fear of injury after a spate of well-publicised attacks across the UK. The other victim, David Hobson, an off-duty firefighter, described the liquid as smelling like ""ammonia"" and desperately tried to clean it off after he was hit. Jailing Kelly at Birmingham Magistrates' Court, chairman of magistrates Ann Brown told him he had shown little remorse and added his actions ""could not be taken for granted"". Kelly, who had been found guilty of two counts of common assault at an earlier trial, replied: ""I understand.""

Texas gunman 'had row with mother-in-law',"Kelley is believed to have been in a family row with his ex-wife and in-laws, police say Texas church gunman Devin Patrick Kelley was armed with three guns and had argued with his mother-in-law before the rampage, officials say. The attack on the small church outside San Antonio during Sunday services left 26 people dead - half were children. Kelley called his father after he was shot by an armed bystander and said he did not think he would survive. US officials said he was not legally permitted to own the weapons, including a semi-automatic rifle and two pistols. Freeman Martin, the regional director for the Texas Department of Public Safety, told reporters it appeared that Kelley died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound after first being shot by a ""good Samaritan"". This video can not be played 'Our kids play together,' says a resident whose neighbours are feared dead ""This was not racially motivated, it wasn't over religious beliefs,"" Mr Martin said. ""There was a domestic situation going on with the family and in-laws,"" he said, adding that Kelley had sent threatening texts to his mother-in-law. ""We know that he expressed anger towards his mother-in-law, who attends this church,"" Mr Martin added. The small town where everyone knows a victim His mother-in-law, Michelle Schields, was not present during the shooting at the First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs. However, her mother, Lula White, was killed in the hail of bullets, according to relatives' Facebook posts and interviews with the New York Daily News. This video can not be played How the Texas church mass shooting unfolded Kelley fled the scene after exchanging gunfire with a local resident who heard gunshots coming from across the road, Mr Martin said on Monday. Johnnie Langendorff told local media that he picked up the Texas man, identified by US media as Stephen Willeford, and the pair pursued Kelley in a car chase. He said they drove at speeds of up to 95mph (153km/h) until the gunman lost control of his car and crashed. Kelley was later found dead inside his vehicle with what appeared to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound, police said. Wilson County Sheriff Joe Tackitt said between 12 and 14 children were among those killed in the attack in Sutherland Springs, a small town 30 miles (50km) south-east of the city of San Antonio. The youngest of those who died was only a year old. As many as eight members of the Holcombe family were killed in the shooting,the Washington Post reported,external. The BBC spoke to the Holcombes' neighbour Pauline Garza, who said the family did not come back from church. Sutherland Springs: The victims America's gun culture in 10 charts The First Baptist Church's pastor, Frank Pomeroy, told US media his 14-year-old daughter, Annabelle, was among those killed. This video can not be played 'Belle died with her church family,' her mother said Officials said 23 people were found dead inside the church while two people were fatally shot outside. Another died in hospital, authorities said. Of the 20 wounded, 10 are in hospital in a critical condition. Kelley was court-martialled in 2012 after he was accused of assault against his wife and step-son. He was sentenced to 12 months' confinement. He received a ""bad conduct"" discharge two years later, according to Ann Stefanek, a US Air Force spokeswoman. Who was Sutherland Springs gunman? Texas Governor Greg Abbott said: ""It's clear this is a person who had violent tendencies, who had some challenges, and someone who was a powder keg, seeming waiting to go off."" Mr Abbott added that the attacker should not legally have been allowed to own a firearm, after having been denied a gun owner's permit by the state. Kelley worked till last July as a security guard for an amusement park run by the Schlitterbahn company in New Braunfels near Sutherland Springs. His employment was ""terminated"" after just over five weeks, the company said. He had a licence to work as an unarmed security guard, a job that police described as ""similar to a security guard at a concert-type situation"". ""There were no disqualifiers entered into the national crime information database to preclude him from receiving a private security licence,"" police said. Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington He was kicked out of the US Air Force, but how it happened may be important in understanding how he was able to purchase the weapons he used to kill 26 individuals in Sutherland, Texas. Individuals who have been dishonourably discharged from the US military are prohibited from possessing firearms. Kelley had a ""bad conduct"" discharge, which is a level below ""dishonourable"" and didn't automatically qualify for a ban. Kelley received his discharge because he was convicted in a military court of assaulting his wife and child, which - under federal and Texas law - could have been deemed a domestic violence incident that would have prevented him from purchasing a firearm. In addition, if the conviction was classified as a felony, that too would have been an automatic disqualification. The key, it seems, is translating a court martial verdict into its civilian equivalent. A prison sentence of a year or more, which Kelley received from the military court, is also grounds for a gun-ownership prohibition. None of this apparently came up on Kelley's instant background check when he sought to buy firearms from a sporting goods store in Texas, however. Kelley also did not disclose details of his military criminal justice record on his purchase paperwork.

Woman seeks private rape prosecutionEmily Hunt is seeking what is thought to be the UK's first crowdfunded private rape prosecution.7h7 hours agoEngland,"This video can not be played Emily Hunt said she ""had a lightbulb moment"" that she was drugged A woman seeking what is thought to be the UK's first crowdfunded private rape prosecution says she hopes to lead the way for those ""let down"" by the courts. Emily Hunt from London, claims she was drugged and raped in 2015. Police investigated, but the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) felt there was insufficient evidence to proceed with a case. Ms Hunt has hired a barrister who believes there are grounds for a criminal prosecution. Ms Hunt - who has waived her right to anonymity - told theBBC's Victoria Derbyshire programmeon the day of the alleged rape she woke up ""completely naked"" at 22:00 in a hotel room next to a man she had ""never seen"". Her last memory of that day was between 16:00 and 17:00, she said, when she had been having a meal with her father. When she ""finally came to"", she added, she had a ""light-bulb moment"" that she had been drugged. ""I'd never felt like that before. I'd lost five hours of my life and wound up somewhere where I didn't know how I got there."" She said she hid in the bathroom and phoned a friend, who rang the police. With no memory of the encounter Ms Hunt was not aware they had had sex until police informed her they had found used condoms in the hotel room. The man told police they had had sex but insisted it was consensual. Ms Hunt believes it was rape as she would not have been in a state to consent. Police told her the man had also ""filmed her naked and unconscious on the bed"" and carried out a sex act over her body. The police referred her case to the CPS, who upon reviewing CCTV footage and toxicology tests decided there was not enough evidence to proceed. CCTV footage of Ms Hunt and the man showed them kissing and holding hands as they walked to the hotel after leaving a bar. Toxicology tests, taken almost nine hours after her last memory, showed Ms Hunt was at least two times over the drink drive limit, but came back negative for any signs of the date rape drug GHB. Ms Hunt believes the toxicology report was ""flawed"", and that CCTV footage - which she said showed her unable to stand without support - demonstrated how she could not have been in a position to give consent. She estimated the cost of a potential private rape prosecution to be Â£50,000 - a sum she is hoping to crowdfund. ""It is an amazing thing that we as individuals can bring a criminal charge in a case where the system has let us down, that can result in a rapist going to jail,"" she said. The Metropolitan Police said it ""carried out a thorough investigation following [Ms Hunt's] allegations"" and ""will always provide support to anyone who reports a serious sexual offence"". Ms Hunt's complaints over its investigation were ""independently reviewed by the IPCC and not upheld"", it continued. The CPS said ""having looked carefully at all the available evidence, a specialist prosecutor decided there was insufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction in this case"". A further review - conducted at the request of Ms Hunt - ""upheld the original decision"", it added.

"Backlash over 'insulting' attendance driveGet a Grip campaign tells parents to ""be more organised"" by preparing for school the night before.10h10 hours agoSussexComments","The controversial campaign has been labelled ""disgusting"" and ""offensive"" A campaign telling parents to send children to school if they have colds has prompted more than 6,500 signatures to a petition against its ""aggressive, condescending and insulting"" message. Leaflets were sent in East Sussex County Council's Get a Grip drive to parents whose children missed at least three days of the current school year. They also give advice on ""being more organised"" the night before school. The council said it ""won't flinch from this extremely serious issue"". The campaign features the slogan ""good reasons for missing school - there are none"". The petition, set up by Ella Lewis of Seaford, calls for the council to withdraw the campaign and apologise for the ""disgusting and offensive"" alienation of parents, particularly those ""struggling with serious illnesses, traumas and ongoing disabilities and conditions"". Mrs Lewis, 37, who has two children, received the leaflet after her six-year-old daughter had three days off for a chest infection and stomach bug. This equated to 91% attendance over the short autumn half term - below the council's 95% expectation. Ella Lewis said the campaign was offensive rather than productive She said: ""These are unattainable standards. The council says it expects a doctor's note, but even if you could get a GP appointment, people are told not to go to the doctor's with a sickness bug. ""Schools also tell you not to allow your child back to school until you're 48 hours clear of a vomiting bug. In taking that direction, you fall into the 'persistence absence' threshold and are potentially reported to the council by the school. It's nonsensical. ""As parents we need to be able to validate our own child's health and suitability to be in school."" Mrs Lewis, who works in a school, said: ""The council could have been more polite, engaging or creative. ""But they've just offended people who are trying to do their best every day for their children."" The council says headaches, coughs and colds are ""not reasons"" for school absence The leaflet sent out to parents also warns them about fines for unauthorised absences, including holidays during term time, and says children should attend school if they have a cold, headache or minor illness. A council spokesman said the campaign was not aimed at parents of children who had genuine medical reasons for being absent, but for those who regularly have odd days off or holiday in term time. He said: ""We appreciate this campaign has been controversial. ""Missing even one day of school has an impact not just on a child's education but on the rest of the class, as it means the teacher has to spend time helping them catch up - to the detriment of other pupils. Missing days of school reduces children's chances of achieving success.""
