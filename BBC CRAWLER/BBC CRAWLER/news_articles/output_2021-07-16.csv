UK plans biggest flu vaccine rollout this winter,"Free flu vaccines will be offered this winter to children aged two to 16 in England, as well as people aged 50 and over or in ""at-risk"" groups, amid the double threat of Covid and influenza. Experts hope for a record-breaking rollout reaching more than 35 million people, including more teenagers than ever before. Last winter there was a high uptake, with 19 million doses given. Under-16s will be offered the vaccine in nasal spray rather than as a jab. An expanded secondary school programme means, for the first time, pupils up to Year 11 (aged 11 to 16) will be invited, not just those in their first academic year - Year 7 - like last winter. When the programme begins in September, the flu vaccine will be available for free on the NHS to: all children aged two and three on 31 August 2021 all children in primary school and all secondary school pupils aged 11 to 16 those aged six months to under 50 years in clinical risk groups pregnant women those aged 50 years and over unpaid carers close contacts of people with weak immune systems (immunocompromised individuals) front-line health and adult social care staff People who are not in these groups will be able to pay for a flu vaccine at some supermarkets and High Street chemists, once available. Flu levels were lower than expected across the world last winter, which experts attribute to infection control measures introduced to stop Covid, such as mask wearing, social distancing and lockdowns. It is not clear what this winter may hold for flu and Covid. Research from Public Health England,,externalcarried out in the first pandemic wave before any Covid vaccine had been made or given, suggests risk of death is more than doubled for people who catch flu on top of coronavirus, compared to coronavirus alone. Covid symptoms: Is it cold, flu or coronavirus? Flu by itself can also be a serious condition - it kills about 11,000 people in England each year. Alongside the flu drive, the government is preparing for a booster programme of Covid vaccines for those most vulnerable, such as older people and those with underlying health conditions. Dr Yvonne Doyle, medical director at Public Health England, said: ""Last winter, flu activity was extremely low, but this is no reason for complacency as it means less people have built up a defence against the virus. ""Combined with the likelihood that Covid will still be circulating, this makes the coming flu season highly unpredictable."" Health and Social Care Secretary Sajid Javid said: ""We want to build a wall of protection by immunising a record number of people. ""With the nation getting closer to normal life, we must learn to live with Covid-19 alongside other viruses and we're offering the free flu jab to millions more people to help keep them safe this winter.""

Under the skin of OnlyFans,"Victoria-May says she received abuse on her account OnlyFans, a social media platform best known for explicit content, has boomed during the pandemic. But from receiving terrorism videos to racial abuse and rape threats, a BBC investigation based on the experiences of dozens of women reveals concerns about how the British-run site is structured, managed and moderated. Warning: Story contains adult themes and language Tina Bean had been living in her car for two months when she started selling nude photos of herself on OnlyFans. The 22-year-old had been kicked out of home after a ""big fight"" and spent most of last summer sleeping in car parks in the heat of Phoenix, Arizona. Everybody else she knew was making ""a hell of a lot of money"" on the site. ""So, I was like, I might as well just jump on it."" She is one of the million content creators on OnlyFans who share photos and videos with subscribers for a monthly fee. In return, the site takes 20% of their earnings. Creators can post a range of content from beauty to fitness videos, but it's widely known for pornography. Soon Tina was making $2,000 (Â£1,450) a month and able to rent her own flat. But in January, a hacker seized control of her account, blackmailed her for $150 and uploaded streams of IS terror videos. The footage, seen and verified by BBC News, depicts people being held hostage in warehouses, or running in fear, before being shot in the head. ""They seemed terrifying,"" she says. ""I kept deleting them and changing my password but kept getting locked out of my account."" The perpetrator then spammed more than 40 of her fans, calling them the N-word, before stealing all of her photos and posting them on a porn site. Tina says after a tortuous cycle of repeatedly being hacked over a month, she reported this to OnlyFans and temporarily disabled her account. She has now lost nearly all of her subscribers and earns just $100 a week - if she's lucky. In a statement, OnlyFans said the account did not have two-factor authentication, which made it vulnerable. The company said Tina did not report the racial slur and it was not detected by the site's moderation system because it was pluralised. It added that this system has now been upgraded and ""in light of this particular incident"", protocols have been updated to ensure that any hacked account's content is fully reviewed before access is restored. Tina's account was hacked OnlyFans became a cultural phenomenon during the pandemic, as lockdowns pushed people online to make and spend money. Founded by Essex businessman Tim Stokely in 2016, it has become one of the UK's fastest-growing tech platforms, with more than 120 million users worldwide. Celebrity endorsements and articles about ordinary women making life-changing amounts of money from selling nudes has boosted its profile, and last year the site handled payments worth Â£1.7bn. The social media platform allows creators to put content behind a paywall and charge a monthly subscription fee - which ranges from $4.99 to $49.99 - for access. Creators can top up their earnings by sharing exclusive pay-per-view posts and receiving tips. OnlyFans thrives on high engagement, and one of its big appeals is that creators and fans can build relationships through livestreams, personalised messages, and direct requests for custom-made photos and videos. Much of the content is explicit - earning it a reputation as the ""paywall of porn"" - and users must be 18 or over to sign up. But behind the glamour of how it is presented, the reality for some has been very different. Tina's experience highlights what creators and digital experts describe as  systemic problems with how OnlyFans is structured, managed, and moderated. The BBC has interviewed dozens of creators in the UK and US, seen copies of complaints and correspondence with OnlyFans, and found: Terror videos, rape threats and racial abuse have been posted on the site in the past year in violation of its terms of service, as well as explicit photos of a student uploaded without her consent Data protection experts have raised concerns about the security of the website's server after creators were hacked, or affected by glitches resulting in nude photos of others appearing on their accounts OnlyFans' policy of granting automatic refunds to fans who are blocked can perpetuate and incentivise abuse, according to creators The site has now adjusted its processes around closing creators' accounts after the BBC questioned why one had her page shut down without explanation, which resulted in it being restored OnlyFans explicitly states on its website that it is ""not responsible"" for moderating content, or detecting breaches of the law or its policies, which includes bans on harassment and sharing illegal or non-consensual images. But it told the BBC that, while it was not legally obliged to proactively review content on the platform, it goes ""above and beyond"" what current regulations require by using community reporting and artificial intelligence software to help keep users safe. The company says it evaluates over 300,000 media files a day, and has more than 500 agents involved in compliance and moderation. It said that all flagged content is reviewed on a case-by-case basis. Digital experts have told the BBC that artificial intelligence can be unreliable for porn, and OnlyFans needs more human moderators as explicit content is more susceptible to issues of abuse or copyright. ""The difference with OnlyFans is the way it's set up,"" says Matt Navarra, a social media consultant. ""Because of the type of content, and the risk it potentially presents to more vulnerable users, the stakes are higher, and therefore the level of responsibility is greater as well."" Charlie, a care leaver and student, joined OnlyFans two years ago, having had a baby OnlyFans creators sell a fantasy - just like the millions of videos freely available on porn sites. Yet in the media, it has developed a reputation as being home to the naughty girl next door, who is more accessible than professional adult entertainers. Tips for customised content can be lucrative, and one 20-year-old student, Charlie, said she has received requests ranging from $50 for a video of her eating a pizza, to $200 for one of her masturbating with sex toys. ""It's not about someone that's just looking for a quick video, like on Pornhub,"" says Victoria-May, a mother-of-two from Northampton. ""It's about relationship building."" Two years ago, the 31-year-old quit her job as a trainee accountant to sell homemade pornography on the site. She says she has now made more than Â£1m. But this hasn't come without difficulties, and she says setting boundaries with some of her ""fans"", who pay $30 a month to view her triple-X-rated photos and videos, has led to a deluge of abuse, rape and death threats. She says that last summer, a male subscriber threatened violence after she declined to have sex with him - and sent messages to her OnlyFans account, including: ""I know where you live. ""I'm going to hunt you down. ""I'm going to kill your children. ""I'm going to rape you. ""I'm going to make your husband watch me as I hurt you, then I'm going to kill you. ""I hope all of your family get Covid and die."" When Victoria-May reported these threats, OnlyFans said ""rude messages"" did not violate its guidelines and the subscribers' account would not be removed. But as the company takes 20% of earnings, she feels it has a duty to take action. Victoria-May says she is one of more than 300 creators earning more than Â£700,000 The site then took six months to respond to more than 20 successive complaints - which were seen by the BBC - including reports of racial abuse directed at participants in her videos. OnlyFans said it handled Victoria-May's complaints ""in a timely manner"" and that any fan reported and found to have been abusive is immediately removed from the platform. It added that it only began to review and investigate suspicious keywords in direct messages from April this year. Stalking, bullying and harassment is against OnlyFans' guidelines and the site says breaches of this policy may lead to accounts being suspended or terminated. For creators who do receive abuse, the site allows them to mute or block that fan. However, the platform automatically gives anyone who has been blocked - regardless of the reason - a refund of their active subscription. Many creators who spoke to the BBC felt this policy was misused by fans and some said it can incentivise them to be rude or provocative, as their monthly subscriptions come to a close. Others added this made them feel penalised for being mistreated. Bell was stalked online by a fan ""The refunds issued to abusive consumers should be re-evaluated,"" says SkylaRayne, 26, a creator from New York. ""We are the ones putting the food on their tables. So, when I'm being harassed and insulted, I'd expect [OnlyFans] to allow me to block someone without them getting a refund. That's just bare minimum."" But creators say that blocked fans are able to create new accounts and sign-up to their pages again. This was the experience of Bell, a 23-year-old model from Manchester, who says she was harassed by a fan last year who was requesting extreme content in return for tips. ""It got very intense, so I decided to cut it off after six months,"" she recalls. ""And they reacted quite badly to that - it was obsessive, obsessive behaviour. ""They were stalking me over multiple accounts, watching me through my friends' stories on Instagram, they had quite a lot of me, so I was worried that they could use this against me."" Bell reported the fan to OnlyFans three times and she says the site later advised blocking him. But he continued to sign-up to her page using multiple new accounts. She told the BBC her experience could have been better if OnlyFans had a live chat function, which would have enabled her concerns to be responded to immediately. The company says Bell was not willing to provide evidence of any specific abuse. It said that on all the occasions the site was contacted by her, it replied promptly with advice and later blocked the IP address of the alleged abusive fan. OnlyFans added that, as a subscription-based platform where fans pay for access and content, it was ""uniquely geared to dissuade and deter abusive behaviour from users"" because, unlike anonymous social media, it could swiftly identify and remove them. OnlyFans is failing to prevent underage users from selling and appearing in explicit videos, according to a BBC investigation. Under-18s have used fake identification to set up accounts, and police say a 14-year-old used her grandmother's passport. The children selling explicit videos on OnlyFans For most creators, the appeal of the site is that photos and videos are locked behind a paywall. Pirating content is illegal, and against OnlyFans' terms of service. But nearly all of the creators spoken to said their images had been leaked and traded by men in other social media and messaging forums. Some told the BBC their photos had been maliciously sent to family members, or that they had been blackmailed into sharing nudes for free or told they would be made public. ""People are naively lulled into a false sense of security from the paywall, that what's behind it stays behind it,"" says Honza Cervenka, a lawyer in the UK specialising in image-based sexual abuse at McAllister Olivarius. ""Legally, content creators give OnlyFans a licence for their content but they keep the copyright,"" he says. ""That leaves the primary responsibility to remedy a leak on content creators, which can be a hard, long and costly legal process."" Risks of being on OnlyFans can also include data protection breaches and hackings, according to creators who shared screenshots about the security of the site. BBC News found that at different times some creators have faced ""glitches"" that have resulted in other peoples' photos appearing on their accounts. Kandii Kitten, 26, was one of those affected, and said an image of a man holding his penis had been posted on her page when she had attempted to upload a nude photo. Another creator, Katja Miyatovich, was hacked while using the platform in May, despite having two-factor authentication security enabled to prevent this. As she was logged-in when it was happening, the 27-year-old from Canada was able to quickly regain access. She shared the email alerting her to the unidentified access to her account with BBC News. ""That is extremely disturbing and definitely a personal data breach,"" says Rowenna Fielding, a data protection consultant. ""Without a doubt that [hacking] should have been investigated and reported to the Information Commissioner's Office."" Tim Turner, who also specialises in data protection, agrees and said that because Katja was hacked despite having two-factor authentication, and these glitches were not a one-off fault, it raises questions about the security of OnlyFans' server. He added that OnlyFans should consider making two-factor authentication mandatory for creators on the platform given the intimate nature of the content. In response, OnlyFans says Katja's account may have been accessed by someone with access to her linked Twitter account and phone number, and says it advised her to utilise the authenticator app instead of SMS verification. It also said it runs a significant takedown team to help creators remove leaked content, with a 75% success rate, and now works with third-party providers to proactively locate, identify and remove stolen content. The site added it was ""very aware of its obligations under data protection laws"" and as with all online platforms, there are sometimes system issues and incidents, which may or may not be data breaches. It said it investigates and reports them as appropriate. Madison, a 22-year-old student from Texas, discovered that her former roommate had been selling topless photos of her on OnlyFans for nearly four months last year without her knowledge. As images on the site are hidden behind a paywall, she had only found out after her images were cross-promoted on Twitter to drive traffic to the account. What had started as a night of playing around and taking what she describes as ""sexy pictures"" with her friends in their dorm, ended with her being exploited and the Polaroids falsely advertised as lesbian content. Her ""gut sank"" at the realisation as she scanned through the pictures on OnlyFans, which were seen by the BBC. ""I like girls who like girls,"" one post read, while another encouraged $5 tips. ""When I think about what she did, it stays with you, that you got used, that she violated me,"" she said. OnlyFans' guidelines ban creators from sharing intimate photos without permission and requires any users making content featuring other people to have written proof of their consent, or says they must also be registered creators. But the BBC understands proof of consent is only requested if an account is flagged or reported, which relies on people being aware that their images are on the site. ""OnlyFans overnight became one of the biggest cowboys in the wild wild West of the [unregulated] porn industry,"" says Kate Isaacs, who campaigns against image-based sexual abuse, known as revenge porn. ""But unfortunately the lack of moderation on the site and ensuring its technology is robust enough to protect people who choose to put their content on there is just seriously lagging behind."" Digital consultants say OnlyFans could deploy more sophisticated, automated technology whereby creators are required to submit recorded proof of consent at the point of upload to proactively prevent this because of the added difficulties the paywall presents for community moderation. Madison's photos were deleted by her ex-roommate after she reported the incident, last May, to state police, who confirmed an investigation is under way. She is now considering taking legal action against the creator. Despite having breached the company's policies, BBC News found the alleged perpetrator is still using OnlyFans under a different pseudonym. OnlyFans said it uses proprietary software as well as manual reviews within its content moderation system to monitor and manage compliance with its terms and conditions. SkylaRayne says the site has transformed her life, but wants the refund policy re-evaluated OnlyFans' position in the porn world became more prominent after payment providers Mastercard and Visaended their relationshipwith PornHub followingallegationsof unlawful content last year. Many of its performers relocated to OnlyFans. Brian Honigman, a marketing consultant and adjunct professor at New York University, said OnlyFans should over-commit to moderation to safeguard its user base. ""And at the end of the day, this does protect your long-term ability to generate revenue and be a profitable business,"" he says. ""The subscription model is great, and the paywall is great when used correctly, but it's important that platforms like OnlyFans make sure they're being used in a way that leads to positive impacts."" Many of the creators who spoke to BBC News still use OnlyFans and say, financially at least, it has transformed their lives. But they have spoken out in the hope it would lead to them receiving better support. As one said: ""They need to protect the people that made them that platform in the first place."" Creators' names have been used and Madison's name has been changed.

Uber will continue to require riders to wear masks,"Uber has said passengers will still be required to wear a face covering when using its services after Covid restrictions are relaxed across Britain on Monday. Face masks have been required in taxis and on public transport for the past year to reduce the spread of the virus. But Uber has said it will keep its ""no mask, no ride"" policy in place. That's despite rules in England being replaced with guidance advising people to wear masks in enclosed spaces. Uber said the policy was for the safety of both its passengers and drivers, although it will not apply if people are exempt. Firms left to decide own rules on face masks Mayors demand masks remain on public transport ""As cities continue to open up, we will ensure that face coverings or masks continue to be a mandatory requirement, unless exempt, when travelling with Uber across the UK,"" the ride-hailing firm's UK general manager Ash Kebriti said. Uber is the latest transport operator to announce that masks will continue to be mandatory on its services after Monday. London Mayor Sadiq Khan hasdeclared masks mandatoryon public transport in the capital and Greater Anglia has said masks willremain compulsoryon its services. Mayors including Greater Manchester's Andy Burnham and West Midlands' Andy Street have urged passengers to continue wearing face coverings but do not have the power to make it mandatory. The government has previously said masks were still ""expected and recommended"" in crowded indoor areas, but people in England will not be required by law to wear themfrom Monday. Some airlines have confirmed that masks will still be compulsory after 19 July, while other businesses such as shops, restaurants and pubs are still setting out their plans. On Friday, pub chain Wetherspoons said it planned to retain floor screens between tables, one-way systems and limits on the number of people in its pubs. But it said that customers and employees would be able to choose whether they wear a mask. Meanwhile, the Co-op has said face coverings will only be ""strongly encouraged"" in its supermarkets, rather than mandatory. In Scotland, the mandatory use of face coverings will remain in place for ""some time"", First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said, even after the country eases most of its other restrictions on 19 July. In Wales, masks will continue to be required by law in some settings, including public transport.

Family sue officials over murder video of US teen,"The lawsuit accuses prosecutors of breaching federal child pornography laws (Pictured: Bianca with mother) The mother of a 17-year-old girl who was killed in 2019 has filed a lawsuit accusing officials of sharing sex and murder videos with the media. The death of Bianca Devins prompted widespread media attention when images posted by her murderer went viral. Now her family's lawsuit alleges that explicit footage recorded by her killer was given to documentary makers. The family is suing Oneida County in New York State and officials including local District Attorney Scott McNamara. The filing alleges they ""acted unconscionably and lawlessly"" toward the victim with ""reckless dissemination of evidence"" to media producers seeking to cover the case. The lawsuit claims Kimberly Devins, Bianca's mother, was shattered to learn videos taken by Brandon Clark had been shared. She now fears the material of them having sex will also go viral online, like the other images he shared of her daughter's murder. It also accuses officials of breaking federal child pornography laws, because the evidence included video footage of Bianca having sex with Brandon Clark before he killed her. The BBC contacted Oneida County District Attorney's Office and Mr McNamara, but both are yet to respond. Bianca Devins was killed in July 2019 by Clark, 21, who stabbed the teenager in his car as they were driving home from a concert in Queens, a borough of New York City. He documented the attack online - posting graphic images of Bianca's body to platforms like Snapchat and Instagram, as well as a Discord server used by her friends. He attempted to take his own life after the murder, but survived. He was prosecuted and was sentenced to 25 years in prison in March this year. Images Clark posted of Bianca Devins' body spread rapidly on social media in the aftermath of her murder. The public nature of her killing led to rapid growth in both her and her killer's Instagram accounts, with impersonators popping up and reposting the images to take advantage of the morbid interest. Kimberley Devins has said she still receives online abuse and graphic photographs of her daughter's body from trolls. The teenager whose murder was exploited for clicks After his arrest, it emerged that Clark had also recorded videos of the murder. The lawsuit says that dashboard clips showed him having sex with the 17-year-old before stabbing her to death after accusing her of infidelity in a ""jealous rage"". Kimberly Devins long-feared this footage would be made public and, according to her lawsuit, sought assurance from Oneida County prosecutors that the material would be protected. The lawsuit alleges she was later told by two sets of documentary makers that the sex and murder videos had been shared with them by the district attorney's office, along with nude photographs from her daughter's phone. The lawsuit says Bianca Devins' family were told graphic evidence was shared with documentary makers Carrie Goldberg, a lawyer who specialises in sexual exploitation, is representing Kimberly Devins. ""This has been emotionally devastating and fatiguing,"" Ms Goldberg told the BBC. ""The family has not had a day of peace since Bianca died over two years ago."" She described the mother's experience of ""perpetual hell"" as she continues to receive graphic online abuse, including the images of her daughter's body. The lawsuit also alleges that Kimberly Devins has repeatedly been denied access to the evidence that has been shared with the media. It says law enforcement officials previously told Kimberly that New York state's child pornography laws, which have a younger limit, did not apply on the shared material as Bianca was 17. Both she, her legal counsel and the lawsuit say the video and nude photographs are unlawful under federal law and accuse the plaintiffs of disseminating child pornography. The lawsuit is seeking punitive damages and an injunction to stop the material being shared any further. The BBC contacted the documentary producers named on the lawsuit for comment. Kimberly Devins has spoken about wanting to change the laws on graphic content being shared on social media in the aftermath of her daughter's killing. Ms Goldberg says she is also hoping to pursue legal action against social media firms relating to the case.

Sarah Everard's killer sacked from police job,"Wayne Couzens will be sentenced for the murder of Sarah Everard in September The police officer who murdered Sarah Everard has been dismissed from the Metropolitan Police, a week after admitting the crime. Wayne Couzens, 48, pleaded guilty on 9 July to the murder of the 33-year-old marketing executive. The hearing was held as soon as possible afterPC Couzens' guilty plea,the Met Police said. He had previously pleaded guilty at the Old Bailey, on 8 June, to the kidnap and rape of Ms Everard. Assistant Commissioner Helen Ball sacked him with immediate effect. Sarah Everard: Daughter, sister, friend and colleague The disciplinary hearing was held in private after Met bosses ruled that ""the need for transparency was outweighed by the risk of interfering with criminal proceedings"", and the decision was published straight afterwards. Police misconduct hearings wouldÂ normallyÂ be heldÂ in public. The Met said it would not release - until they are heard in open court - any details of the hearing, which involve the events leading up to Ms Everard's death. Sarah Everard was optimistic about her future, friends said Couzens had planned an abduction at least three days in advance, hiring a car and buying carpet protector. He encountered Ms Everard as she walked home to her flat in Brixton from a friend's house in Clapham on 3 March. Investigators are looking into whether he used his police identification to persuade Ms Everard into the car. The firearms officer spent the day he abducted Ms Everard working at the US Embassy. Ms Everard's friends raised the alarm when they were unable to contact her the following day. Her body was found a week later, in an industrial rubble sack, near land Couzens owned in Kent. Ms Everard had been strangled. Wayne Couzens in uniform, holding a breathalyser Ms Ball said: ""Couzens has betrayed everything we, the police, stand for and following his guilty pleas and convictions I have dismissed him today. ""All of us in the Met are horrified, sickened and angered by this man's crimes. Sarah was a young woman who had her life cruelly snatched away from her. I know she is sorely missed by so many people and our thoughts remain with her loved ones. We are so profoundly sorry."" It emerged that the former officer was suspected of indecent exposure at fast-food restaurants in London and Kent, although he was still allowed to remain on active service. Couzens is due to be sentenced at the Old Bailey on 29 September. Met sickened by Couzens' crime - Cressida Dick.

Family sue officials over murder video of US teenBianca Devins' family claim video of her having sex and also her murder were shared with the media.US & Canada,"The lawsuit accuses prosecutors of breaching federal child pornography laws (Pictured: Bianca with mother) The mother of a 17-year-old girl who was killed in 2019 has filed a lawsuit accusing officials of sharing sex and murder videos with the media. The death of Bianca Devins prompted widespread media attention when images posted by her murderer went viral. Now her family's lawsuit alleges that explicit footage recorded by her killer was given to documentary makers. The family is suing Oneida County in New York State and officials including local District Attorney Scott McNamara. The filing alleges they ""acted unconscionably and lawlessly"" toward the victim with ""reckless dissemination of evidence"" to media producers seeking to cover the case. The lawsuit claims Kimberly Devins, Bianca's mother, was shattered to learn videos taken by Brandon Clark had been shared. She now fears the material of them having sex will also go viral online, like the other images he shared of her daughter's murder. It also accuses officials of breaking federal child pornography laws, because the evidence included video footage of Bianca having sex with Brandon Clark before he killed her. The BBC contacted Oneida County District Attorney's Office and Mr McNamara, but both are yet to respond. Bianca Devins was killed in July 2019 by Clark, 21, who stabbed the teenager in his car as they were driving home from a concert in Queens, a borough of New York City. He documented the attack online - posting graphic images of Bianca's body to platforms like Snapchat and Instagram, as well as a Discord server used by her friends. He attempted to take his own life after the murder, but survived. He was prosecuted and was sentenced to 25 years in prison in March this year. Images Clark posted of Bianca Devins' body spread rapidly on social media in the aftermath of her murder. The public nature of her killing led to rapid growth in both her and her killer's Instagram accounts, with impersonators popping up and reposting the images to take advantage of the morbid interest. Kimberley Devins has said she still receives online abuse and graphic photographs of her daughter's body from trolls. The teenager whose murder was exploited for clicks After his arrest, it emerged that Clark had also recorded videos of the murder. The lawsuit says that dashboard clips showed him having sex with the 17-year-old before stabbing her to death after accusing her of infidelity in a ""jealous rage"". Kimberly Devins long-feared this footage would be made public and, according to her lawsuit, sought assurance from Oneida County prosecutors that the material would be protected. The lawsuit alleges she was later told by two sets of documentary makers that the sex and murder videos had been shared with them by the district attorney's office, along with nude photographs from her daughter's phone. The lawsuit says Bianca Devins' family were told graphic evidence was shared with documentary makers Carrie Goldberg, a lawyer who specialises in sexual exploitation, is representing Kimberly Devins. ""This has been emotionally devastating and fatiguing,"" Ms Goldberg told the BBC. ""The family has not had a day of peace since Bianca died over two years ago."" She described the mother's experience of ""perpetual hell"" as she continues to receive graphic online abuse, including the images of her daughter's body. The lawsuit also alleges that Kimberly Devins has repeatedly been denied access to the evidence that has been shared with the media. It says law enforcement officials previously told Kimberly that New York state's child pornography laws, which have a younger limit, did not apply on the shared material as Bianca was 17. Both she, her legal counsel and the lawsuit say the video and nude photographs are unlawful under federal law and accuse the plaintiffs of disseminating child pornography. The lawsuit is seeking punitive damages and an injunction to stop the material being shared any further. The BBC contacted the documentary producers named on the lawsuit for comment. Kimberly Devins has spoken about wanting to change the laws on graphic content being shared on social media in the aftermath of her daughter's killing. Ms Goldberg says she is also hoping to pursue legal action against social media firms relating to the case.

"Mohoric wins as Cavendish denied chanceMatej Mohoric wins stage 19 of the Tour de France, denying Mark Cavendish an opportunity to break the record for stage wins he shares with Eddy Merckx.BBC Sport","Matej Mohoric is the current Slovenian road race champion Bahrain-Victorious' Matej Mohoric won stage 19 of the Tour de France, denying Mark Cavendish an opportunity to break the record for stage wins he shares with Eddy Merckx. Cavendish had hoped to compete for a 35th stage win, but a breakaway of 20 riders left the peloton well behind. Cavendish will get another chance in Sunday's final stage, which finishes on the Champs-Elysees in Paris. Slovenia's Tadej Pogacar remains in the leader's yellow jersey. Mohoric's second win of the Tour comes after his team's hotel wasraided by French police on Wednesday over an allegation of doping. He said after his win: ""I was thinking mostly about what happened two days ago. You feel a bit like a criminal. It's a good thing the police are checking - of course they found nothing, because we have nothing to hide. ""But I'm a bit disappointed with the system - it's not a nice thing when police walk into into your room and start going through all your belongings. ""Even if you have nothing to hide it feels a bit weird when they go through your personal things, photos of your family, your phone and your messages."" The largely flat 207km stage into Libourne was expected to result in a sprint finish, with all eyes on Cavendish, who was warmly embraced by Belgian cycling legend Merckx at the start in Mourenx. However, after a frenetic opening and early crashes involving Geraint Thomas, Rafal Majka, Enric Mas, Sonny Colbrelli and Cavendish, a large breakaway was allowed to escape by a peloton with little appetite to deliver a meaningful chase on the back of several punishing days in the Pyrenees. And Mohoric delivered a replica of the superb solo attack that carried him to victory on stage seven, riding clear with 26km to go and extending his lead as the chasing group failed to organise themselves. The peloton rolled home almost 21 minutes later, and Pogacar will defend a lead of five minutes and 45 seconds over Jonas Vingegaard in Saturday's 30.8km individual time trial from Libourne to Saint Emilion. Cavendish apologised to his mechanics after video emerged of him complaining about his bike before storming off to the team bus. Footage showed the 36-year-old screaming at his team before slamming a bike into the ground at the start of the stage. ""During a day of the Tour de France, as riders we are put in a perilous situation and I wanted my bike to be perfect, in order to help me stay safe,"" he wrote on Instagram. ""My bike had some problems when I got on it this morning. Despite this, I should not have reacted in the way that I did and not so publicly.

Green Man festival to return next month,"The festival is set in the Brecon Beacons National Park One of Wales' largest music festivals has been given the green light to go ahead next month, following a further easing of Covid restrictions. The Green Man festival will welcome people back to the Black Mountains in Powys on 19 August for its 19th year. Tickets have sold out for acts including former Super Furry Animals frontman Gruff Rhys, Charlotte Church and Irish post-punk band Fontaines DC. Local businesses are looking forward to 20,000 people descending on the area. Covid gig experiment brings the good times back Wales' lockdown festival 'to bring much needed joy' Eid marked in first pilot Covid event for crowds Held in the Brecon Beacons National Park, the festival, as its name suggests, prides itself on its green credentials.

These range from using recyclable items such as cups and powering the stages from the sun and other renewable sources. It started off in Hay-on-Wye - another Powys town which is famous for a different type of festival - drawing hundreds of people in over three years from 2003. Charlotte Church is bringing her Late Night Pop Dungeon to the festival However, it was in 2006 when it moved to the Glanusk Estate near Crickhowell that it really took off - with numbers attending growing to 20,000. This year, revellers can experience 10 areas, and as well as the music, there will be stages for comedy, literature, mindfulness, theatre and contemporary dance. One of the more intimate stages at the festival in 2017 It is the only major UK music festival to have a female director - Fiona Stewart -  with controlling ownership, and is estimated to contribute Â£10.4m to the Welsh economy each year. Taking centre stage will be Swedish electronic act Little Dragon, with the quartet from Gothenburg headlining along with Scottish post-rockers Mogwai and Irish post-punk act Fontaines DC. Singer Yukimi Nagano of Little Dragon will take centre stage Formed in Dublin in 2017, the Mercury Prize and Grammy-nominated outfit, who won BBC 6 Music's album of the year in 2019, are set to close the festival on 22 August. The fourth headliner is Caribou - the stage name of Canadian Dan Snaith - who has enjoyed much critical acclaim, including 2014 album Our Love being named the IMPALA album of the year. Other acts that will be more familiar to a Welsh audience include Charlotte Church and Gruff Rhys, who has had a long career both with the Super Furry Animals, as a solo artist and through other collaborations such as Neon Neon. Fontaines DC formed after the band's members bonded over a love of poetry Former Welsh Music Prize winner Gwenno and harpist Catrin Finch will also perform. It is nestled in the the Black Mountains, in the Brecon Beacons National Park. Abergavenny and Crickhowell are nearby, with businesses looking forward to the boost to the local economy usually brought by the festival. The nearby town of Crickhowell is looking forward to welcoming visitors from the festival Buster Grant, head brewer of Brecon Brewing, said the Green Man festival had been ""very important"" over the years to his business. ""Events have a twofold impact - there's the financial gain, so not having those events made a big dent in our sales and turnover,"" he said. ""The other one is public perception - so getting out to those events and we probably see something like 2,000 people. ""We hopefully keep a lot of them very happy with the sales of our beer, so [without the festival] those onward sales weren't happening."" Buster Grant says his brewing business loses out without events Mr Grant said his company lost 90% of its business overnight when the first lockdown happened, and developed 19 new beers and ciders in bottles and cans for people to drink at home. His company has also began working with the Welsh Rugby Union to supply beer and cider, and is in discussions with the Football Association of Wales.

Fully jabbed arrivals from France must still quarantine,"Fully jabbed travellers returning to England and Wales from France will still have to quarantine from Monday. From 19 July, adults who have been double jabbed in the UK arriving from amber list countries will not need to isolate for 10 days. But the government said the easing would not apply to France due to ""persistent"" cases of the Beta variant, first identified in South Africa. There are concerns vaccines may not work as well against the Beta variant. The Beta variant accounts for about 10% of new infections in France, but that includes the Indian Ocean territories of Reunion and Mayotte, where the variant is near-universal. The more infectious Delta variant - first identified in India - accounts for almost all new cases in the UK. Health Secretary Sajid Javid said: ""We have always been clear that we will not hesitate to take rapid action at our borders to stop the spread of Covid-19 and protect the gains made by our successful vaccination programme. ""With restrictions lifting on Monday across the country, we will do everything we can to ensure international travel is conducted as safely as possible, and protect our borders from the threat of variants."" Travel firms have criticised the move, accusing the government of causing confusion. Willie Walsh, the director-general of the International Air Transport Association said ""the UK has no coherent policy on international travel"" and is ""destroying its own travel sector and the thousands of jobs that rely on it"". How are summer holiday rules changing on Monday? How can I prove I'm fully vaccinated? How dangerous are new variants? The government announcement means that anyone who has been in France in the previous 10 days will need to quarantine on arrival to England in their own accommodation and will need a day two and day eight test, regardless of their vaccination status. This includes any fully vaccinated individual who transits through France from either a green or another amber country. But ministers indicated that Eurostar passengers on services travelling through France would not need to quarantine if their train did not stop in the country. Existing amber list exemptions for key workers such as hauliers will remain in place. Meanwhile, France has tightened its rules for UK travellers who are not fully vaccinated, requiring a negative test in the 24 hours before arrival from Sunday, rather than the 48 hours allowed previously. But anyone fully vaccinated with a jab from Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna, AstraZeneca or Johnson & Johnson will be exempt from providing a negative test. French MEP Veronique Trillet-Lenoir told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that it was ""difficult to understand"" the UK rules, as the Beta variant is ""not present at all"" in mainland France, with France's cases mainly being found in its overseas territories. BBC Paris correspondent Hugh Schofield said there had been no official response from the French government yet, but it would be pushing for an explanation from its London counterpart for the toughened policy. Travellers to the UK from France will still have the option of shortening their quarantine period throughthe Test to Release scheme,external- if they pay for a test on day five and are negative. For arrivals from other amber list countries, the requirement to quarantine is being scrapped for the fully vaccinated and under-18s from Monday in all parts of the UK. Each UK nation sets its own travel rules. A Scottish government spokesperson said ministers were ""considering the best approach"" for arrivals from France ""as we look to adopt a four nation approach on international travel, where possible"". Wales said it would be following the change set by England, while Northern Ireland is yet to announce its intention. LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? LOCKDOWN RULES:What are they and when will they end? VACCINE:When will I get the jab? Prof John Edmunds, an epidemiologist from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and a government adviser on the Sage committee, said the Beta variant was at low levels in the UK but, as immunity from vaccines increases, ""conditions are right"" for it to gain an advantage. He told the Today programme that the Beta variant is probably less infectious than the dominant Delta variant, but it appears to be better able to evade the immune response from vaccines - particularly from the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. The UK is currently facing a ""long and drawn out"" wave of infections from the Delta variant, he said, as it will not be brought down by lockdowns as previous peaks were. He said cases are on course to hit 100,000 a day in about two weeks, although school closures may help to bring down the surge or cause it to level off. But high levels of infection were likely throughout the rest of the summer and autumn, he said. Travel trade body Abta said the changes to travel to France will delay ""any meaningful recovery for the industry"", adding that financial support needed to be given to the sector. Tim Alderslade, chief executive of industry group Airlines UK, said: ""These random rule changes make it almost impossible for travellers and industry to plan ahead, and can only further undermine consumer trust at the very peak of the summer season."" Johan Lundgren, chief executive of EasyJet, said the government was ""making it up as they go along and causing confusion and uncertainty"". Labour said the move had created ""complete chaos"". Shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said: ""In effect the government has announced yet another category for travel and they've done it on a Friday evening... It is travellers and the travelling industry that is paying the price."" Georgina Thomas, a nurse from Buckinghamshire, is one of those affected by the change. The 32-year-old has been visiting her parents in the countryside between La Rochelle and Bordeaux for the last three weeks with her baby daughter. ""I'm frustrated with the inconsistent approach the government are taking, it doesn't all appear logical,"" she told the PA news agency. ""If a quarantine is necessary then so be it but I'm confident that my risk will be higher when I return to the UK."" Ms Thomas, who is still on maternity leave, added: ""It will be a long 10 days but we are the fortunate ones, I understand that, plenty will think we shouldn't be travelling anyway."" James Miles from West Sussex said the quarantine requirement had put his plans to visit his girlfriend in France for the first time since 1 January in jeopardy. ""This is really affecting people's lives,"" he said. ""Seven months is a long time not to see your partner. I can't even see the light at the end of the tunnel. Where do we go from here?"" This video can not be played James Miles says his plans to visit his partner in France have been thrown into doubt Anne, a British citizen living in Paris who did not wish to give her second name, has not seen her family in 18 months, with her parents yet to meet their granddaughter, who was born in Paris last autumn. The 31-year-old told the BBC she had booked their trip to London for late August on Friday morning - just hours before the announcement was made. She also suggested most of the Beta variant cases were not found in mainland France. ""How can the government encourage non vaccinated people in the UK to stop wearing masks and start going clubbing, yet oblige fully vaccinated travellers from France to quarantine?"" Anne added. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said: ""Whilst we are committed to continuing to open up international travel safely, our absolute priority is to protect public health here in the UK."" There had been reports the government was considering adding France to the red list for travel. Only UK or Irish nationals or UK residents are allowed to travel from red list countries and they must then quarantine in a government-approved hotel for 10 days, at a cost of Â£1,750 for one adult. It comes just two days after the government announced popular holiday destinations Ibiza, Majorca, Menorca and Formenterawould be moved to the amber list. In other developments: Chairman of the Commons health select committee Jeremy Hunt warned that Covid restrictions may have to be reintroduced if cases are still rising when schools return in September. He also said the ""warning light on the NHS dashboard... is flashing red"" with hospital admissions expected to rise to 10,000 by the end of August The Trades Union Congress has called on the government to ""fix sick pay"" amid rising numbers of people being asked to self-isolate. Deputy general secretary Paul Nowak said many people cannot afford the time off work Bulgaria has announced a ban on UK travellers entering the country amid rising cases On Friday,more than 50,000 daily coronavirus cases were reported in the UKfor the first time since mid-January.

Fully jabbed France arrivals must still quarantineA planned relaxation of England's rules from Monday will not apply due to cases of the Beta variant.UK,"Fully jabbed travellers returning to England and Wales from France will still have to quarantine from Monday. From 19 July, adults who have been double jabbed in the UK arriving from amber list countries will not need to isolate for 10 days. But the government said the easing would not apply to France due to ""persistent"" cases of the Beta variant, first identified in South Africa. There are concerns vaccines may not work as well against the Beta variant. The Beta variant accounts for about 10% of new infections in France, but that includes the Indian Ocean territories of Reunion and Mayotte, where the variant is near-universal. The more infectious Delta variant - first identified in India - accounts for almost all new cases in the UK. Health Secretary Sajid Javid said: ""We have always been clear that we will not hesitate to take rapid action at our borders to stop the spread of Covid-19 and protect the gains made by our successful vaccination programme. ""With restrictions lifting on Monday across the country, we will do everything we can to ensure international travel is conducted as safely as possible, and protect our borders from the threat of variants."" Travel firms have criticised the move, accusing the government of causing confusion. Willie Walsh, the director-general of the International Air Transport Association said ""the UK has no coherent policy on international travel"" and is ""destroying its own travel sector and the thousands of jobs that rely on it"". How are summer holiday rules changing on Monday? How can I prove I'm fully vaccinated? How dangerous are new variants? The government announcement means that anyone who has been in France in the previous 10 days will need to quarantine on arrival to England in their own accommodation and will need a day two and day eight test, regardless of their vaccination status. This includes any fully vaccinated individual who transits through France from either a green or another amber country. But ministers indicated that Eurostar passengers on services travelling through France would not need to quarantine if their train did not stop in the country. Existing amber list exemptions for key workers such as hauliers will remain in place. Meanwhile, France has tightened its rules for UK travellers who are not fully vaccinated, requiring a negative test in the 24 hours before arrival from Sunday, rather than the 48 hours allowed previously. But anyone fully vaccinated with a jab from Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna, AstraZeneca or Johnson & Johnson will be exempt from providing a negative test. French MEP Veronique Trillet-Lenoir told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that it was ""difficult to understand"" the UK rules, as the Beta variant is ""not present at all"" in mainland France, with France's cases mainly being found in its overseas territories. BBC Paris correspondent Hugh Schofield said there had been no official response from the French government yet, but it would be pushing for an explanation from its London counterpart for the toughened policy. Travellers to the UK from France will still have the option of shortening their quarantine period throughthe Test to Release scheme,external- if they pay for a test on day five and are negative. For arrivals from other amber list countries, the requirement to quarantine is being scrapped for the fully vaccinated and under-18s from Monday in all parts of the UK. Each UK nation sets its own travel rules. A Scottish government spokesperson said ministers were ""considering the best approach"" for arrivals from France ""as we look to adopt a four nation approach on international travel, where possible"". Wales said it would be following the change set by England, while Northern Ireland is yet to announce its intention. LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? LOCKDOWN RULES:What are they and when will they end? VACCINE:When will I get the jab? Prof John Edmunds, an epidemiologist from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and a government adviser on the Sage committee, said the Beta variant was at low levels in the UK but, as immunity from vaccines increases, ""conditions are right"" for it to gain an advantage. He told the Today programme that the Beta variant is probably less infectious than the dominant Delta variant, but it appears to be better able to evade the immune response from vaccines - particularly from the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. The UK is currently facing a ""long and drawn out"" wave of infections from the Delta variant, he said, as it will not be brought down by lockdowns as previous peaks were. He said cases are on course to hit 100,000 a day in about two weeks, although school closures may help to bring down the surge or cause it to level off. But high levels of infection were likely throughout the rest of the summer and autumn, he said. Travel trade body Abta said the changes to travel to France will delay ""any meaningful recovery for the industry"", adding that financial support needed to be given to the sector. Tim Alderslade, chief executive of industry group Airlines UK, said: ""These random rule changes make it almost impossible for travellers and industry to plan ahead, and can only further undermine consumer trust at the very peak of the summer season."" Johan Lundgren, chief executive of EasyJet, said the government was ""making it up as they go along and causing confusion and uncertainty"". Labour said the move had created ""complete chaos"". Shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said: ""In effect the government has announced yet another category for travel and they've done it on a Friday evening... It is travellers and the travelling industry that is paying the price."" Georgina Thomas, a nurse from Buckinghamshire, is one of those affected by the change. The 32-year-old has been visiting her parents in the countryside between La Rochelle and Bordeaux for the last three weeks with her baby daughter. ""I'm frustrated with the inconsistent approach the government are taking, it doesn't all appear logical,"" she told the PA news agency. ""If a quarantine is necessary then so be it but I'm confident that my risk will be higher when I return to the UK."" Ms Thomas, who is still on maternity leave, added: ""It will be a long 10 days but we are the fortunate ones, I understand that, plenty will think we shouldn't be travelling anyway."" James Miles from West Sussex said the quarantine requirement had put his plans to visit his girlfriend in France for the first time since 1 January in jeopardy. ""This is really affecting people's lives,"" he said. ""Seven months is a long time not to see your partner. I can't even see the light at the end of the tunnel. Where do we go from here?"" This video can not be played James Miles says his plans to visit his partner in France have been thrown into doubt Anne, a British citizen living in Paris who did not wish to give her second name, has not seen her family in 18 months, with her parents yet to meet their granddaughter, who was born in Paris last autumn. The 31-year-old told the BBC she had booked their trip to London for late August on Friday morning - just hours before the announcement was made. She also suggested most of the Beta variant cases were not found in mainland France. ""How can the government encourage non vaccinated people in the UK to stop wearing masks and start going clubbing, yet oblige fully vaccinated travellers from France to quarantine?"" Anne added. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said: ""Whilst we are committed to continuing to open up international travel safely, our absolute priority is to protect public health here in the UK."" There had been reports the government was considering adding France to the red list for travel. Only UK or Irish nationals or UK residents are allowed to travel from red list countries and they must then quarantine in a government-approved hotel for 10 days, at a cost of Â£1,750 for one adult. It comes just two days after the government announced popular holiday destinations Ibiza, Majorca, Menorca and Formenterawould be moved to the amber list. In other developments: Chairman of the Commons health select committee Jeremy Hunt warned that Covid restrictions may have to be reintroduced if cases are still rising when schools return in September. He also said the ""warning light on the NHS dashboard... is flashing red"" with hospital admissions expected to rise to 10,000 by the end of August The Trades Union Congress has called on the government to ""fix sick pay"" amid rising numbers of people being asked to self-isolate. Deputy general secretary Paul Nowak said many people cannot afford the time off work Bulgaria has announced a ban on UK travellers entering the country amid rising cases On Friday,more than 50,000 daily coronavirus cases were reported in the UKfor the first time since mid-January.

US wants giant radar in UK to track space objects,"The US wants to locate a giant new radar system in the UK to track objects in deep space. The US Space Force is developing the global system to identify potential ""targets"" up to 36,000km away, in areas of deep space where a lot of military satellites are positioned. Other sites would include Texas and Australia. The Ministry of Defence said the new radar capability has the potential to make space ""safer and more secure"". It comes amid growing concerns about congestion, competition and even an arms race in space. Both the US and Britain have accused Russia and China of developing weapons which could be used to take out satellites. Last year alone more than 1,000 new satellites were launched into space - including 10 by the US military. Europe plans sat-nav and telecoms network for Moon UK space race investment 'is heating up' Russia accused of firing satellite weapon in space The plans to develop the Deep Space Advanced Radar Capability - or DARC - are being developed at the US Space and Missile Systems Center. It was one of the sites visited by Defence Secretary Ben Wallace and UK defence chiefs this week on a visit to California. They also held discussions with Elon Musk's SpaceX. Lt Col Jack Walker of the US Space Force told the BBC the US was ""in discussion"" with the UK about putting the radars ""possibly in Scotland or further south"". He said the site would house ""anywhere from 10 to 15 parabolic antenna (large satellite dishes) for tracking and four to six for transmitting"" and cover an area of about 1km square. Each radar dish will be 15 metres in diameter. Col Walker said the purpose of the system would be to ""detect and track targets which could potentially be threats to our high-value assets"". ""It could be from the Chinese, it could be from the Russians, it could be anti-satellite or it could be debris in space,"" he said. The US already operates an early warning system to detect ballistic missiles in space, which includes a service at RAF Fylingdales in North Yorkshire. But the radar systems at the secretive RAF base can only detect objects up to 20,000km (12,400 miles) away. The new DARC system will be able to see much further. Col Walker says it will be able to detect an object the size of a football up to 36,000km (22,400 miles) away. On the US visit, the UK's chief of the air staff, Sir Michael Wigston, said ""right now the UK is focused on understanding what's going on in the dark corners of space"". He said the increasing congestion and competition in space ""all point to needing to rapidly build our understanding of what's going on"". Sir Michael has predicted the next war could be won or lost in space. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said the government would be publishing a space strategy in the autumn. He said space was under threat and the UK needed to protect its key national infrastructure. Mr Wallace said he did not think there was going to be ""moonraker and Star Wars lasers in space"". The UK's military doctrine would not be about ""wrecking space but defending and protecting space"", he added. A Ministry of Defence spokesperson said: ""This new radar capability has the potential to make space safer and more secure, helping to protect our satellite system by tracking and monitoring objects. ""We are exploring our potential partnership with the USA on DARC and discussions so far have been positive.""

At least 120 dead as floods sweep Western Europe,"This video can not be played Drone footage shows flood damage in Germany and Belgium At least 120 people have died and hundreds more in western Europe are unaccounted for after some of the worst flooding in decades. Record rainfall caused rivers to burst their banks, devastating the region. In Germany, where the death toll now stands at over 100, Chancellor Angela Merkel called for a determined battle against climate change. At least 20 people have died in Belgium. The Netherlands, Luxembourg and Switzerland are also affected. Many factors contribute to flooding, but a warming atmosphere caused by climate change makes extreme rainfall more likely. The world has already warmed by about 1.2C since the industrial era began and temperatures will keep rising unless governments around the world make steep cuts to emissions. MAPS: Where are the worst-hit areas? ANALYSIS: How floods caught Germany by surprise PICTURES: Floods kill dozens in western Europe WITNESSES: 'My city looks like a battlefield' Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo declared 20 July a national day of mourning. ""We are still waiting for the final toll, but this could be the most catastrophic flooding our country has ever seen,"" he said. We met an elderly man trying to get into a village which was all but destroyed. His grandchildren were there, he said, but he couldn't get hold of their parents. Even the authorities say they don't know for sure how many people are missing. There is no phone signal in much of the region, making communication all but impossible. But the death toll is expected to rise today and with every hour that passes the magnitude of this disaster becomes ever clearer. All along the River Ahr there are flooded homes, broken bridges, the twisted remains of campsites and caravan parks. For many of the dazed people we met surveying the damage here, it's almost impossible to imagine clearing up and starting again. Some 15,000 police, soldiers and emergency service workers have been deployed in Germany to help with the search and rescue. Entire villages have been destroyed, and officials in the western German district of Ahrweiler say up to 1,300 people are unaccounted for. Gregor Jericho, a resident of Rheinbach in North Rhine-Westphalia, told the BBC: ""It's a very sad scene. Streets, bridges and some buildings are destroyed. There's garbage everywhere. ""Parts of buildings are in the road, people are sitting and crying. It's so sad. People have lost their homes, their cars are in fields flooded. My city looks like a battle has taken place."" As many as 1,300 people are still unaccounted for in the western German district of Ahrweiler In the same town, Ansgar Rehbein told Reuters he saw the river's water level rising so rapidly that he had to immediately get out of his house. ""Once the river started overflowing and the water came down from the hillside, it was a matter of two minutes before the courtyard was flooded with waist-high water,"" he told the news agency. ""We had to get out through the window and uphill in order to save ourselves."" Your device may not support this visualisation In Belgium, dramatic footage of the floods showed cars being swept away along a street in the city of Verviers. A curfew was in place overnight because of the risk of looting. Residents of LiÃ¨ge, Belgium's third-largest urban area after Brussels and Antwerp, were ordered to evacuate on Thursday. Local officials said those unable to leave should move to the upper floors of their buildings. The Meuse river, which flows through the city, stabilised on Friday morning, with small overflows in some areas. Scientists have condemned politicians for failing to protect their citizens from extreme weather events such as the floods in northern Europe and the US heat dome. They have been predicting for years that summer rainfall and heatwaves would become more intense due to human-induced climate change. Hannah Cloke, Professor of Hydrology at the University of Reading, said: ""The deaths and destruction across Europe as a result of flooding is a tragedy that should have been avoided. ""Forecasters issued alerts early in the week, and yet the warnings were not taken seriously enough and preparations were inadequate. ""The fact that other parts of the northern hemisphere are currently suffering record-breaking heatwaves and fires should serve as a reminder of just how much more dangerous our weather could become in an ever-warmer world."" Scientists say governments must both cut the CO2 emissions that are fuelling extreme events, AND prepare for more extreme weather. Yet in the UK - hit by severe flooding on Monday - the government's advisory climate change committee recently told ministers the nation was even worse prepared for extreme weather than it was five years ago. It said the government was keeping only a fifth of its pledges to cut emissions. And only this week the UK government told people that they don't need to reduce flying because technology will solve the emissions problem - a notion that most experts consider a gamble. READ MORE: Science failed to predict flood and heat intensity The Netherlands has reported no casualties but thousands of people in towns and villages along the Meuse river have been urged to leave their houses quickly. The river running through the Swiss capital Bern burst its banks, flowing at a record rate of 560 cubic metres a second on Friday. Lake Lucerne is flooding into the town and people in Basel have been told to keep well away from the River Rhine. There is also the risk of mud and rock slides in the Alps as the flood waters run off. Global heating causes more water to evaporate, which leads to an increase in the amount of annual rain and snow At the same time, a warmer atmosphere means it can hold more moisture - which also increases the intensity of rainfall Rather than gently watering plants, this intense rainfall leads to flooding, like we're seeing in Northern Europe now Have you been affected by the flooding in Germany?

Warnings grow about staff forced to self-isolate,"Retailers have warned about staff shortages because of self-isolation rules Fears are growing of a ""surge"" in workers and medical staff having to self-isolate when most Covid rules end in England and Scotland on Monday. There were new calls for the government to review plans not to ease isolation rules in England before 16 August. Transport unions warned of ""dire consequences"" next week as more staff are being ""pinged"" by the NHS Covid app and told to self-isolate. Nissan, Rolls-Royce, hospitals and schools have all raised concerns. However, the prime minister's spokesman said on Friday that the tracing app was ""one of the best tools we have"" to tackle coronavirus. ""We are asking people contacted by the app to continue to isolate,"" he said. Despite Monday being called ""freedom day"" in England and Scotland, critics say that without bringing forward the relaxation of quarantine rules, companies and institutions face a staff crisis as more people have to self-isolate. Ministers are examining whether to make the NHS app less sensitive, with 530,126 alerts having been sent in England and Wales during the first week of July. Fully-vaccinated individuals in England will be exempt from having to quarantine over close contact with people suffering Covid-19, but this change will not be introduced until mid-August. Rail, Maritime and Transport union general secretary Mick Lynch warned that Monday ""will see a surge in workers pinged with a self-isolation instruction next week"". ""Even at this late stage, the government, the train operators and the bus companies should issue a clear, legally-backed instruction that levels up the rest of the UK to the safety standards that will remain in force in Wales and Scotland,"" he added. Segolen Goodburn runs her florist on her own - a ""ping"" means it would have to close. Pubs and restaurants also issued warnings over possibly having to close their doors because of the level of pings. UK Hospitality chief executive Kate Nicholls said the industry was facing ""significant staffing challenges"", with up to as many as a fifth of staff isolating at any one time. ""Without better intervention, operators will continue to be forced to reduce their operating hours or to close venues completely, missing the opportunity to begin on their road to recovery,"" she said. ""We urge the government to move quicker on this issue to prevent the summer being cancelled, and vast swathes of the population unnecessarily confined to their homes."" Covid staff shortage could shut meat production Nissan and Rolls-Royce hit as staff told to isolate NHS Covid app: Should it stay or should it go? Hugh Osmond, the founder of Punch Taverns, called for those pinged on the NHS app to be allowed to go back to work if they get a PCR test that is negative. ""It is absolute chaos, and clearly the app really isn't fit for purpose because people are getting pinged all over the place, and the vast majority do not ever test positive, let alone be ill,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Small firms feel particularly vulnerable. Segolen Goodburn, who runs Stem Florists, in Ealing, west London, told the BBC: ""If I get pinged, there is only me - so the shop would have to close. There is no one else to take over. That's the biggest worry."" Rachael Hunt, owner of the Cinnamon CafÃ©, also in Ealing, said: ""I'm one of the lucky ones, none of my staff have been pinged so far,"" she says. ""But if my staff got pinged, I'd have to shut down."" Andrew Goodacre, chief executive of the British Independent Retailers Association, told the BBC: ""In a small shop, if one member of staff tests positive, it's likely that nearly all that team will be deemed to be in close contact, including the owner. Most likely, the shop has to close,"" he says. ""That's a tragedy when they're just in the process of rebuilding their business,"" he adds. Car firms Nissan and Rolls-Royce have warned production could be hit because of staff self-isolating Lord Bilimoria, president of the CBI employers' group which represents 190,000 businesses, said on Thursday that the number of people now required to self-isolate came as a ""genuine shock"". ""Staff shortages are being felt acutely across all sectors and in all areas of business particularly hospitality and leisure,"" he said. Lord Bilimoria believes the NHS Test and Trace system needs an ""overhaul"" and wants the government to ""urgently"" bring forward its plans to allow double-jabbed individuals not to self-isolate. Carmakers Nissan and Rolls-Royce have warned that production could be affected by large numbers of staff being told to isolate, and UK Hospitality, the trade body for bars and restaurants, said it was causing ""carnage"" among its members. England's chief medical officer Chris Whitty has warned that the number of people being treated in hospital with Covid-19 could reach ""quite scary"" levels within weeks. The Royal College of Anaesthetists and the Faculty of Intensive Care Medicine issued a joint call on Friday to exempt double-jabbed NHS staff from isolation over close contacts. ""The risk of patients contracting Covid from vaccinated healthcare staff is minimal compared to the damage that patients could suffer by having their treatment delayed,"" a statement said. ""Without this exemption in place, the NHS will not be able to address the waiting lists. We encourage the government to not wait until August to free vaccinated healthcare workers from the isolation rules - we need this to happen now."" Chris Hopson, the chief executive of NHS Providers, said the hospital trusts the organisation represents are increasingly concerned over dealing with the care backlog ""with large numbers of staff unable to work"". ""We know that national leaders are working hard to find a solution to this problem. The key is that this solution is delivered as a matter of urgency,"" he added. Health bosses in Sunderland have asked staff to consider postponing holidays to help the trust as it comes under ""extreme pressure"" because of a surge in coronavirus cases. The Downing Street spokesman said that, as Covid cases go up, it was expected the number of people asked to isolate would increase. He would not be drawn on possible exemptions for specific industries, saying the government wouldn't comment on ""hypotheticals"" - while adding all things are kept ""under review."" Downing Street also downplayed the possibility of being ""pinged"" through a wall shared with a neighbour, following widespread reports on Friday. The spokesman said it was ""highly unlikely"" because the app uses low-energy Bluetooth. The government is therefore ""confident"" that this is not contributing to a ""large number of individuals being asked to self-isolate"", he said.

First cruise ship since Covid set to visit Scotland,"MS Island Sky will be the first cruise ship to visit Scotland since the pandemic The first cruise ship to visit Scotland since the Covid pandemic is set to arrive in Lerwick Harbour next week. It follows the Scottish government's lifting of a virus-related ban and the reopening of the country's ports to cruise ships on UK-only sailings. Domestic voyages to and from English ports have been operating since mid-May. Operated by Noble Caledonia, the MS Island Sky will berth at Victoria Pier on Monday with 66 passengers on board. The vessel, which is operating at half its capacity, will complete a full circumnavigation of the UK, taking in some rarely visited and remote locations. Mike Deegan, head of fleet operations for Noble Caledonia, said: ""We are delighted to be re-affirming our strong connections with our friends in Scotland, a country we have visited regularly over the last 30 years. ""Our strict Covid-safe protocols, both on board and ashore, will ensure we shall visit with safety of local communities and those on-board paramount."" Cruise passengers arriving at Lerwick harbour before the lockdown ban came into force Last year was expected to be a record year for Shetland with about 100 visits booked. But only two cruise ships docked in February before the pandemic forced Scotland into lockdown. In the initial phase of restarting, passengers coming ashore at Lerwick are likely to travel in ""bubbles"" of up to 15. They will also observe all safety protocols, such as using face coverings and hand hygiene. Lerwick Port Authority chief executive, Captain Calum Grains, said: ""We've been working through the many steps required with all interested parties to ensure that Covid measures are in place to protect everyone involved during cruise ship visits. ""These measures meet official requirements and complement the comprehensive steps taken by cruise operators which set some of the highest standards seen in the tourism industry."" Steve Matheson, Shetland Islands manager for VisitScotland, welcomed the return of cruise ships and said they would provide a financial boost for local bus operators, tour guides, attractions and retailers. Last month passengers on a cruise ship touring the UK were told they wouldnot be allowed to disembark in Greenock, Inverclyde. The MSC Virtuosa's operator said Scottish government Covid rules blocked it from entering the port. According toScottish government guidelines,externaldomestic cruises with more than 12 passengers will only be allowed when all of Scotland reaches level one. Some parts of the country are still in level two but, from Monday all, of Scotland will move into level zero. RULES:What are the restrictions in your area? EASING:What rules are changing, and when?

Ironman Wales cancelled for 2021,"Ironman Wales is the biggest event in Pembrokeshire's calendar The Ironman Wales triathlon event due to be held in Pembrokeshire has been cancelled for the second successive year because of Covid-19. The event, which attracts thousands of athletes and spectators to west Wales, was due to take place on 12 September. Organisers accepted Pembrokeshire County Council's recommendation not to hold the event, though they said the decision was made with ""a heavy heart"". Ironman Wales issaid to be worth Â£3.7mto the local economy. The event is now due to return on 11 September, 2022, with Ironman announcing that a new five-year agreement has been reached with Pembrokeshire County Council which means Ironman Wales will happen annually in Tenby until 2026. ""After careful evaluation of the recent government announcement in Wales, we have been working closely with Pembrokeshire County Council to find a way forward for this year's event,"" said an Ironman statement. ""Uncertainties around moving to alert level zero in Wales, the current epidemiological infection rate and the unique event site at Tenby and Pembrokeshire, as well as large crowds [being] expected to gather on race day, were discussed in a meeting with local authorities. ""Due to the unique race site in Tenby, the recommendation has been made not to support the host agreement for this year and to reschedule the event to 2022. ""While we were hoping otherwise, we respect the council's position and will follow its recommendation to reschedule the event to 2022."" Pembrokeshire first hosted the Ironman - which comprises of a 2.4-mile (3.86km) swim, a 112-mile (180km) bike ride and a marathon - a decade ago. Billed as one of the world's toughest endurance events, it has attracted athletes from all over the world. Pembrokeshire County Council cabinet member for major events Phil Baker said the decision to postpone had been taken in the interests of public safety. ""Given the sheer number of spectators that have always supported Ironman, the narrow nature of parts of the course and the uncertainty that remains over the Covid-19 situation, following extensive discussions with organisers, we have reluctantly decided it is not possible for us to support the event this year,"" he said.

Two lorries and four cars were caught up in the crash at Bowburn, County Durham, at about 18:20 BST on Thursday. Durham Police said three people from two of the cars died at the scene.

South African violence pre-planned - president,"More than 2,500 people have been arrested over the deadly unrest South Africa President Cyril Ramaphosa has said the violence that has rocked the country was pre-planned, describing it as an assault on democracy. Riots were sparked by the jailing of former President Jacob Zuma. The death toll has risen to 212, up by almost 100 since Thursday, the government said. Police officers have been protecting deliveries of food to supermarkets after days of widespread looting led to shortages. An estimated $1bn (Â£720m) worth of stock was stolen in KwaZulu-Natal with at least 800 retail shops looted, a mayor in the province said. ""It is quite clear that all these incidents of unrest and looting were instigated - there were people who planned it and co-ordinated it,"" Mr Ramaphosa said in a visit to KwaZulu-Natal, Mr Zuma's home province and the epicentre of the violence. The president said the riots were an attempt to hijack South Africa's democracy. He told supporters that instigators had been identified, but didn't elaborate. ""We are going after them,"" he added. In KwaZulu-Natal, many have been queuing for food, sometimes from the early hours of the morning just to get a few items. People waiting told the BBC that they were concerned about feeding their families, getting formula and nappies for their babies, and even food for their pets. The week of violence in the province has left roads damaged or blocked by rioters and the government wants to make sure the food supply is not disrupted, said Khumbudzo Ntshavheni, an acting minister. Soldiers have been deployed to potential flashpoints and police are providing escorts for the transportation of oxygen, medicines and other key goods, she said. In a 30-minute televised address later on Friday, Mr Ramaphosa said there was no shortage of food or supplies and urged people against panic buying. He said more than 2,500 people had been arrested in connection with the unrest and urged South Africans to come together. ""If we stand together, no insurrection or violence in this country will succeed,"" he said. ""We are engaged in a struggle to defend our democracy, our Constitution, our livelihoods and our safety. ""This is not a battle that we can afford to lose."" Claims about South Africa unrest fact-checked 'I'm struggling to find food after South Africa looting' South Africa mother: Why I threw my baby to strangers Looting and shooting in South Africa 'war zone' Protests began last week after Zuma handed himself in to police to serve a 15-month sentence for contempt of court. Zuma's supporters reacted furiously to his imprisonment, blockading major roads and calling for a shutdown to demand his release. The protests descended into riots on a scale rarely seen in South Africa. Businesses in every sector were looted, burnt and petrol-bombed in cities and towns across KwaZulu-Natal, as well as Gauteng, which surrounds the country's biggest city, Johannesburg.

Scotland saw 1 in 90 people with the virus last week. Northern Ireland had 1 in 290 and Wales 1 in 360 Edited by John Hand and Daniel Coles We're bringing our live page to a close now. We will be back with all the latest reaction as coronavirus restrictions are eased in England and Scotland on Monday. It promises to be a landmark day in this pandemic. Today's coverage has been written by Emma Harrison and Lauren Turner. It was edited by Dan Coles and John Hand. Thanks for joining us this Friday for our coronavirus live page coverage. Here's a reminder of the main headlines from today: Just a reminder that Health Secretary Sajid Javid had previously warned that case numbers could reach 50,000 a day by 19 July - as they now have. Andearlier this week, he said that the daily coronavirus cases in the UK could reach 100,000 later this summer. But he said he did not think this would put ""unsustainable pressure on the NHS"". That's because vaccinations have created a ""protective wall"" meaning we can ""withstand a summer wave"", he added. Central estimates from modellers advising the government also show that Covid deaths are expected to be between 100 and 200 per day at the peak, although there is a large amount of uncertainty over that.   As we mentioned, today's figure of 51,870 cases is the highest since 15 January. On that day - which was also a Friday - there were 55,761 cases reported in the UK. The highest number of cases recorded in the UK since the pandemic started was also in January. It came on 8 January, when there were 68,053 cases. You can use ourlook-up tool hereto find out how many cases there are in your area now.  James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News Passing 50,000 cases a day feels like a worrying landmark - but is it? We were last at those levels around the peak of the second wave in January when it took a tough lockdown to prevent hospitals buckling. But now more fuel is being thrown on the fireas restrictions easein England and Scotland on Monday, and in Wales from Saturday. Cases will go even higher. How high? Nobody knows for sure. Letting this happen is possible only because vaccines have transformed the danger posed by a summer wave. Without them, weâd be debating locking down. Yet vaccines have not eliminated the Covid threat. Letting the virus spread could still put pressure on hospitals, leave people with long Covid and be hugely disruptive as large numbers of people need to isolate. Reaching 50,000 daily cases doesnât mean the same as it did six months ago - but it doesnât mean it will be smooth sailing. A further 61,681 people have had a first coronavirus vaccine, today's figures show. And another 201,893 have now had their second dose. In total, 87.6% of adults in the UK have had one dose and 67.5% have had two. All the latest on the statistics from the government can be foundhere,external. Cases in the UK have been sharply rising, with figures topping 40,000 on Wednesday - having been over 30,000 every day the previous week. One week ago, last Friday, figures were at 35,707. And if we go back just a month ago to 16 June, daily UK cases were 9,055. If youâre interested in seeing how other countries have fared since easing restrictions, weâve got a feature on thathere. The UK has reported more than 50,000 daily coronavirus cases for the first time since mid-January. There were 51,870 cases recorded, the highest since 15 January, and 49 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. The milestone came just days before the easing of restrictions in England and Scotland on Monday. Wales is also making changes to its coronavirus rules as of tomorrow - all the details on what you can do in each nation can be found in our explainerhere. It comes as separate Office for National Statistics data estimates1% of people in the UKhad coronavirus last week. The more infectious Delta variant accounts for almost every case. The British Grand Prix returned today and will see thousands of Formula 1 fans descend on Silverstone over the course of the weekend. Seven-time world champion Lewis Hamilton has posted on his Instagram to urge spectators to wear masks and stay safe. ""It was so nice to see everyone today. So refreshing to see
people and the energy already is so uplifting,"" he wrote. ""Can I please ask you to wear
your masks, be safe. I know of people getting Covid and being ill even with
double jabs. ""So please please stay safe this weekend. Wearing a mask is a small
sacrifice to stay healthy and keep others around us healthy."" Follow the story from BBC Sporthere  Formula 1 fans watching the British Grand Prix at Silverstone Just a reminder about those big changes coming up after the weekend. Easing of restrictions are being made in both England and Scotland on Monday. Wales also sees changes on Saturday and Northern Ireland is set to ease rules on 26 July. Here's some of the things that will be changing inEngland:  Meanwhile, inScotland, all areas will be inCovid protection level 0,externalon 19 July. Here are some of the changes:  For a full list of the changes across the UK,you can read our explainer here. We're expecting the UK's latestdaily coronavirus figures,externalin the next hour or so. Thursday's showed there were 48,553 new cases - the highest reported since 15 January - and 63 deaths. Today's could break the 50,000 case barrier as the numbers have been rising sharply in recent weeks. And that would come just three days before England and Scotland are due to further ease coronavirus restrictions -more on that here. England's chief medical officer has warned that the UK is ""not out of the woods"" yet and people need to act with caution as the restrictions end. He warned that Covid hospitalisations were doubling every three weeks and could hit ""scary numbers"" in future. We'll bring you the latest on the figures when we have them. Health bosses in Sunderland have asked staff to postpone holidays as the local trust is ""under extreme pressure"" due to a surge in coronavirus cases. Staff at South Tyneside and Sunderland NHS Foundation Trust, an area which has one of the highest infection rates in the country, are seeing hospital cases double week-on-week. Bosses told staff earlier this week there were 80 patients receiving treatment - while there were just two exactly a month previously. In the internal memo, they asked for staff to work additional shifts, with a Â£250 bonus for staff who could work an extra week of overtime spread over the next six weeks. Dr Shaz Wahid, medical director at the trust, said: ""We are seeing increasing numbers of patients accessing our services and rising admissions due to the current high numbers of Covid-19 in our local community. ""Understandably, this has had an impact on our workforce as well as the wider public. A woman who travelled to Britain from Australia to see her dying father says she is stuck in the UK. Donna Lewis flew from Queensland to North Lincolnshire in February to help her mother with her father's care. After he died in May, aged 88, she arranged return flights to Australia but these were cancelled when the country imposed new Covid restrictions. Mrs Lewis said she had since been quoted Â£7,500 for a one-way ticket on a September flight. Australia halved the number of international arrivalsit would accept after Covid outbreaks put half the population in lockdown and it is only allowing 3,000 citizens a week to return. Read more The NHS contact tracing app remains ""one of the best tools"" to tackle coronavirus, Downing Street has insisted. The prime minister's spokesman told a press briefing that, as cases go up, you'd expect the number of people asked to isolate to increase as well. But he wouldn't be drawn on possible exemptions for specific industries - adding that everything was kept ""under review"". The government is continuing to look at self-isolation requirements for NHS workers who might get pinged by the app while at work. On the possibility of tweaking the app's sensitivity, the spokesman said that the matter is also being kept under review. And he downplayed the possibility of getting pinged through a wall if one of your neighbours tests positive - as wasreported by the Daily Telegraph,external. He said it was ""highly unlikely"" as the app uses low energy Bluetooth, and the government is confident that that's not contributing to a ""large number of individuals being asked to self-isolate"".  As we've heard, some businesses and unions are concerned there will be a surge in staff having to self-isolate when restrictions in England and Scotland are eased further on Monday. UK Hospitality chief executive Kate Nicholls says the industry is facing ""significant staffing challenges"", with up to as many as a fifth of staff isolating at any one time. ""Without better intervention, operators will continue to be forced to reduce their operating hours or to close venues completely, missing the opportunity to begin on their road to recovery,"" she says. ""We urge the government to move quicker on this issue to prevent the summer being cancelled, and vast swathes of the population unnecessarily confined to their homes."" Hugh Osmond, the founder of Punch Taverns, is calling for those pinged on the NHS app to be allowed to go back to work if they get a PCR test that is negative. ""It is absolute chaos, and clearly the app really isn't fit for purpose because people are getting pinged all over the place, and the vast majority do not ever test positive, let alone be ill,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme earlier. Read more The first cruise ship to visit Scotland since the Covid pandemic began isset to arrive in Lerwick Harbour, Sheltand, next week. It comes after the Scottish government lifted a virus-related ban and the reopening of the country's ports to cruise ships on UK-only sailings. Domestic voyages to and from English ports have been operating since mid-May. Operated by Noble Caledonia, the MS Island Sky will berth at Victoria Pier on Monday with 66 passengers on board. The vessel, which is operating at half its capacity, will complete a full circumnavigation of the UK. Last year was expected to be a record year for Shetland with about 100 visits booked. But only two cruise ships docked in February before the pandemic forced Scotland into lockdown. Steve Matheson, Shetland Islands manager for VisitScotland, welcomed the return of cruise ships and said they would provide a financial boost for local bus operators, tour guides, attractions and retailers. The coronavirus reproduction number - or R number - in England remains unchanged from last week and is between 1.2 and 1.4, latest government figures show. Last week, it was between 1.2 and 1.5. The R number represents the average number of people each person with Covid-19 will go on to infect. If the figure is above 1, it means an outbreak is growing, and when it is below 1, it is shrinking. The current R number means that for every 10 people infected, another 12 to 14 other people will go on to get the virus. As England prepares to ease restrictions on Monday, Covid-19 continues to spread around the world, with about 190 million confirmed cases so far and more than four million deaths. The US, India and Brazil have seen the highest number of confirmed cases, followed by France, Russia, Turkey and the UK. Cases - and deaths - have been rising in many countries as the graph below shows.  The UK currently has the highest number of daily cases in Europe, looking at the weekly average.

His grandmother's face ""lit up"" when he arrived in his Tyrannosaurus rex suit, he says. A video of a supermarket trip he took with his grandmother Mary Jackson, while dressed in the T-rex costume (him not her), has since become a hit on social media - take a look at the video below. This video can not be played Man gives gran post-lockdown surprise with dinosaur outfit Downing Street is refusing to back down amid calls for the relaxation of the self-isolation requirement for the fully-vaccinated to be brought forward. Currently, from 16 August those who have had two vaccines will no longer have to self-isolate if they get notified they've been in close contact with someone who's tested positive for coronavirus. National newspapers, business owners and some MPs have asked why that rule will be suitable in a month's time but not now - but the government has previously explained that its modelling is based on the current wave of infections peaking in the next few weeks, if self-isolation guidelines stay as they are. Asked if the date was unchanged, a No 10 spokesman said: ""It is as the health secretary set out in the House last week."" Â© 2025 BBC.

Scotland saw 1 in 90 people with the virus last week. Northern Ireland had 1 in 290 and Wales 1 in 360 Edited by John Hand and Daniel Coles We're bringing our live page to a close now. We will be back with all the latest reaction as coronavirus restrictions are eased in England and Scotland on Monday. It promises to be a landmark day in this pandemic. Today's coverage has been written by Emma Harrison and Lauren Turner. It was edited by Dan Coles and John Hand. Thanks for joining us this Friday for our coronavirus live page coverage. Here's a reminder of the main headlines from today: Just a reminder that Health Secretary Sajid Javid had previously warned that case numbers could reach 50,000 a day by 19 July - as they now have. Andearlier this week, he said that the daily coronavirus cases in the UK could reach 100,000 later this summer. But he said he did not think this would put ""unsustainable pressure on the NHS"". That's because vaccinations have created a ""protective wall"" meaning we can ""withstand a summer wave"", he added. Central estimates from modellers advising the government also show that Covid deaths are expected to be between 100 and 200 per day at the peak, although there is a large amount of uncertainty over that.   As we mentioned, today's figure of 51,870 cases is the highest since 15 January. On that day - which was also a Friday - there were 55,761 cases reported in the UK. The highest number of cases recorded in the UK since the pandemic started was also in January. It came on 8 January, when there were 68,053 cases. You can use ourlook-up tool hereto find out how many cases there are in your area now.  James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News Passing 50,000 cases a day feels like a worrying landmark - but is it? We were last at those levels around the peak of the second wave in January when it took a tough lockdown to prevent hospitals buckling. But now more fuel is being thrown on the fireas restrictions easein England and Scotland on Monday, and in Wales from Saturday. Cases will go even higher. How high? Nobody knows for sure. Letting this happen is possible only because vaccines have transformed the danger posed by a summer wave. Without them, weâd be debating locking down. Yet vaccines have not eliminated the Covid threat. Letting the virus spread could still put pressure on hospitals, leave people with long Covid and be hugely disruptive as large numbers of people need to isolate. Reaching 50,000 daily cases doesnât mean the same as it did six months ago - but it doesnât mean it will be smooth sailing. A further 61,681 people have had a first coronavirus vaccine, today's figures show. And another 201,893 have now had their second dose. In total, 87.6% of adults in the UK have had one dose and 67.5% have had two. All the latest on the statistics from the government can be foundhere,external. Cases in the UK have been sharply rising, with figures topping 40,000 on Wednesday - having been over 30,000 every day the previous week. One week ago, last Friday, figures were at 35,707. And if we go back just a month ago to 16 June, daily UK cases were 9,055. If youâre interested in seeing how other countries have fared since easing restrictions, weâve got a feature on thathere. The UK has reported more than 50,000 daily coronavirus cases for the first time since mid-January. There were 51,870 cases recorded, the highest since 15 January, and 49 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. The milestone came just days before the easing of restrictions in England and Scotland on Monday. Wales is also making changes to its coronavirus rules as of tomorrow - all the details on what you can do in each nation can be found in our explainerhere. It comes as separate Office for National Statistics data estimates1% of people in the UKhad coronavirus last week. The more infectious Delta variant accounts for almost every case. The British Grand Prix returned today and will see thousands of Formula 1 fans descend on Silverstone over the course of the weekend. Seven-time world champion Lewis Hamilton has posted on his Instagram to urge spectators to wear masks and stay safe. ""It was so nice to see everyone today. So refreshing to see
people and the energy already is so uplifting,"" he wrote. ""Can I please ask you to wear
your masks, be safe. I know of people getting Covid and being ill even with
double jabs. ""So please please stay safe this weekend. Wearing a mask is a small
sacrifice to stay healthy and keep others around us healthy."" Follow the story from BBC Sporthere  Formula 1 fans watching the British Grand Prix at Silverstone Just a reminder about those big changes coming up after the weekend. Easing of restrictions are being made in both England and Scotland on Monday. Wales also sees changes on Saturday and Northern Ireland is set to ease rules on 26 July. Here's some of the things that will be changing inEngland:  Meanwhile, inScotland, all areas will be inCovid protection level 0,externalon 19 July. Here are some of the changes:  For a full list of the changes across the UK,you can read our explainer here. We're expecting the UK's latestdaily coronavirus figures,externalin the next hour or so. Thursday's showed there were 48,553 new cases - the highest reported since 15 January - and 63 deaths. Today's could break the 50,000 case barrier as the numbers have been rising sharply in recent weeks. And that would come just three days before England and Scotland are due to further ease coronavirus restrictions -more on that here. England's chief medical officer has warned that the UK is ""not out of the woods"" yet and people need to act with caution as the restrictions end. He warned that Covid hospitalisations were doubling every three weeks and could hit ""scary numbers"" in future. We'll bring you the latest on the figures when we have them. Health bosses in Sunderland have asked staff to postpone holidays as the local trust is ""under extreme pressure"" due to a surge in coronavirus cases. Staff at South Tyneside and Sunderland NHS Foundation Trust, an area which has one of the highest infection rates in the country, are seeing hospital cases double week-on-week. Bosses told staff earlier this week there were 80 patients receiving treatment - while there were just two exactly a month previously. In the internal memo, they asked for staff to work additional shifts, with a Â£250 bonus for staff who could work an extra week of overtime spread over the next six weeks. Dr Shaz Wahid, medical director at the trust, said: ""We are seeing increasing numbers of patients accessing our services and rising admissions due to the current high numbers of Covid-19 in our local community. ""Understandably, this has had an impact on our workforce as well as the wider public. A woman who travelled to Britain from Australia to see her dying father says she is stuck in the UK. Donna Lewis flew from Queensland to North Lincolnshire in February to help her mother with her father's care. After he died in May, aged 88, she arranged return flights to Australia but these were cancelled when the country imposed new Covid restrictions. Mrs Lewis said she had since been quoted Â£7,500 for a one-way ticket on a September flight. Australia halved the number of international arrivalsit would accept after Covid outbreaks put half the population in lockdown and it is only allowing 3,000 citizens a week to return. Read more The NHS contact tracing app remains ""one of the best tools"" to tackle coronavirus, Downing Street has insisted. The prime minister's spokesman told a press briefing that, as cases go up, you'd expect the number of people asked to isolate to increase as well. But he wouldn't be drawn on possible exemptions for specific industries - adding that everything was kept ""under review"". The government is continuing to look at self-isolation requirements for NHS workers who might get pinged by the app while at work. On the possibility of tweaking the app's sensitivity, the spokesman said that the matter is also being kept under review. And he downplayed the possibility of getting pinged through a wall if one of your neighbours tests positive - as wasreported by the Daily Telegraph,external. He said it was ""highly unlikely"" as the app uses low energy Bluetooth, and the government is confident that that's not contributing to a ""large number of individuals being asked to self-isolate"".  As we've heard, some businesses and unions are concerned there will be a surge in staff having to self-isolate when restrictions in England and Scotland are eased further on Monday. UK Hospitality chief executive Kate Nicholls says the industry is facing ""significant staffing challenges"", with up to as many as a fifth of staff isolating at any one time. ""Without better intervention, operators will continue to be forced to reduce their operating hours or to close venues completely, missing the opportunity to begin on their road to recovery,"" she says. ""We urge the government to move quicker on this issue to prevent the summer being cancelled, and vast swathes of the population unnecessarily confined to their homes."" Hugh Osmond, the founder of Punch Taverns, is calling for those pinged on the NHS app to be allowed to go back to work if they get a PCR test that is negative. ""It is absolute chaos, and clearly the app really isn't fit for purpose because people are getting pinged all over the place, and the vast majority do not ever test positive, let alone be ill,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme earlier. Read more The first cruise ship to visit Scotland since the Covid pandemic began isset to arrive in Lerwick Harbour, Sheltand, next week. It comes after the Scottish government lifted a virus-related ban and the reopening of the country's ports to cruise ships on UK-only sailings. Domestic voyages to and from English ports have been operating since mid-May. Operated by Noble Caledonia, the MS Island Sky will berth at Victoria Pier on Monday with 66 passengers on board. The vessel, which is operating at half its capacity, will complete a full circumnavigation of the UK. Last year was expected to be a record year for Shetland with about 100 visits booked. But only two cruise ships docked in February before the pandemic forced Scotland into lockdown. Steve Matheson, Shetland Islands manager for VisitScotland, welcomed the return of cruise ships and said they would provide a financial boost for local bus operators, tour guides, attractions and retailers. The coronavirus reproduction number - or R number - in England remains unchanged from last week and is between 1.2 and 1.4, latest government figures show. Last week, it was between 1.2 and 1.5. The R number represents the average number of people each person with Covid-19 will go on to infect. If the figure is above 1, it means an outbreak is growing, and when it is below 1, it is shrinking. The current R number means that for every 10 people infected, another 12 to 14 other people will go on to get the virus. As England prepares to ease restrictions on Monday, Covid-19 continues to spread around the world, with about 190 million confirmed cases so far and more than four million deaths. The US, India and Brazil have seen the highest number of confirmed cases, followed by France, Russia, Turkey and the UK. Cases - and deaths - have been rising in many countries as the graph below shows.  The UK currently has the highest number of daily cases in Europe, looking at the weekly average.

Something to make you smile on a Friday lunchtime? Samuel Hutchinson had not seen his grandparents in more than a year because of the pandemic - so he planned an unusual surprise. The 32-year-old, from South Derbyshire, decided to visit his grandparents in Southampton, but dressed as a dinosaur. His grandmother's face ""lit up"" when he arrived in his Tyrannosaurus rex suit, he says. A video of a supermarket trip he took with his grandmother Mary Jackson, while dressed in the T-rex costume (him not her), has since become a hit on social media - take a look at the video below. This video can not be played Man gives gran post-lockdown surprise with dinosaur outfit Downing Street is refusing to back down amid calls for the relaxation of the self-isolation requirement for the fully-vaccinated to be brought forward. Currently, from 16 August those who have had two vaccines will no longer have to self-isolate if they get notified they've been in close contact with someone who's tested positive for coronavirus. National newspapers, business owners and some MPs have asked why that rule will be suitable in a month's time but not now - but the government has previously explained that its modelling is based on the current wave of infections peaking in the next few weeks, if self-isolation guidelines stay as they are. Asked if the date was unchanged, a No 10 spokesman said: ""It is as the health secretary set out in the House last week."" Â© 2025 BBC.

"At least 120 dead as floods sweep Western EuropeAs many as 1,300 people are still unaccounted for after the worst flooding in decades.Europe","This video can not be played Drone footage shows flood damage in Germany and Belgium At least 120 people have died and hundreds more in western Europe are unaccounted for after some of the worst flooding in decades. Record rainfall caused rivers to burst their banks, devastating the region. In Germany, where the death toll now stands at over 100, Chancellor Angela Merkel called for a determined battle against climate change. At least 20 people have died in Belgium. The Netherlands, Luxembourg and Switzerland are also affected. Many factors contribute to flooding, but a warming atmosphere caused by climate change makes extreme rainfall more likely. The world has already warmed by about 1.2C since the industrial era began and temperatures will keep rising unless governments around the world make steep cuts to emissions. MAPS: Where are the worst-hit areas? ANALYSIS: How floods caught Germany by surprise PICTURES: Floods kill dozens in western Europe WITNESSES: 'My city looks like a battlefield' Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo declared 20 July a national day of mourning. ""We are still waiting for the final toll, but this could be the most catastrophic flooding our country has ever seen,"" he said. We met an elderly man trying to get into a village which was all but destroyed. His grandchildren were there, he said, but he couldn't get hold of their parents. Even the authorities say they don't know for sure how many people are missing. There is no phone signal in much of the region, making communication all but impossible. But the death toll is expected to rise today and with every hour that passes the magnitude of this disaster becomes ever clearer. All along the River Ahr there are flooded homes, broken bridges, the twisted remains of campsites and caravan parks. For many of the dazed people we met surveying the damage here, it's almost impossible to imagine clearing up and starting again. Some 15,000 police, soldiers and emergency service workers have been deployed in Germany to help with the search and rescue. Entire villages have been destroyed, and officials in the western German district of Ahrweiler say up to 1,300 people are unaccounted for. Gregor Jericho, a resident of Rheinbach in North Rhine-Westphalia, told the BBC: ""It's a very sad scene. Streets, bridges and some buildings are destroyed. There's garbage everywhere. ""Parts of buildings are in the road, people are sitting and crying. It's so sad. People have lost their homes, their cars are in fields flooded. My city looks like a battle has taken place."" As many as 1,300 people are still unaccounted for in the western German district of Ahrweiler In the same town, Ansgar Rehbein told Reuters he saw the river's water level rising so rapidly that he had to immediately get out of his house. ""Once the river started overflowing and the water came down from the hillside, it was a matter of two minutes before the courtyard was flooded with waist-high water,"" he told the news agency. ""We had to get out through the window and uphill in order to save ourselves."" Your device may not support this visualisation In Belgium, dramatic footage of the floods showed cars being swept away along a street in the city of Verviers. A curfew was in place overnight because of the risk of looting. Residents of LiÃ¨ge, Belgium's third-largest urban area after Brussels and Antwerp, were ordered to evacuate on Thursday. Local officials said those unable to leave should move to the upper floors of their buildings. The Meuse river, which flows through the city, stabilised on Friday morning, with small overflows in some areas. Scientists have condemned politicians for failing to protect their citizens from extreme weather events such as the floods in northern Europe and the US heat dome. They have been predicting for years that summer rainfall and heatwaves would become more intense due to human-induced climate change. Hannah Cloke, Professor of Hydrology at the University of Reading, said: ""The deaths and destruction across Europe as a result of flooding is a tragedy that should have been avoided. ""Forecasters issued alerts early in the week, and yet the warnings were not taken seriously enough and preparations were inadequate. ""The fact that other parts of the northern hemisphere are currently suffering record-breaking heatwaves and fires should serve as a reminder of just how much more dangerous our weather could become in an ever-warmer world."" Scientists say governments must both cut the CO2 emissions that are fuelling extreme events, AND prepare for more extreme weather. Yet in the UK - hit by severe flooding on Monday - the government's advisory climate change committee recently told ministers the nation was even worse prepared for extreme weather than it was five years ago. It said the government was keeping only a fifth of its pledges to cut emissions. And only this week the UK government told people that they don't need to reduce flying because technology will solve the emissions problem - a notion that most experts consider a gamble. READ MORE: Science failed to predict flood and heat intensity The Netherlands has reported no casualties but thousands of people in towns and villages along the Meuse river have been urged to leave their houses quickly. The river running through the Swiss capital Bern burst its banks, flowing at a record rate of 560 cubic metres a second on Friday. Lake Lucerne is flooding into the town and people in Basel have been told to keep well away from the River Rhine. There is also the risk of mud and rock slides in the Alps as the flood waters run off. Global heating causes more water to evaporate, which leads to an increase in the amount of annual rain and snow At the same time, a warmer atmosphere means it can hold more moisture - which also increases the intensity of rainfall Rather than gently watering plants, this intense rainfall leads to flooding, like we're seeing in Northern Europe now Have you been affected by the flooding in Germany?

Armed police protect food after South Africa riots,"More than 2,500 people have been arrested over the deadly unrest South Africa President Cyril Ramaphosa has said the violence that has rocked the country was pre-planned, describing it as an assault on democracy. Riots were sparked by the jailing of former President Jacob Zuma. The death toll has risen to 212, up by almost 100 since Thursday, the government said. Police officers have been protecting deliveries of food to supermarkets after days of widespread looting led to shortages. An estimated $1bn (Â£720m) worth of stock was stolen in KwaZulu-Natal with at least 800 retail shops looted, a mayor in the province said. ""It is quite clear that all these incidents of unrest and looting were instigated - there were people who planned it and co-ordinated it,"" Mr Ramaphosa said in a visit to KwaZulu-Natal, Mr Zuma's home province and the epicentre of the violence. The president said the riots were an attempt to hijack South Africa's democracy. He told supporters that instigators had been identified, but didn't elaborate. ""We are going after them,"" he added. In KwaZulu-Natal, many have been queuing for food, sometimes from the early hours of the morning just to get a few items. People waiting told the BBC that they were concerned about feeding their families, getting formula and nappies for their babies, and even food for their pets. The week of violence in the province has left roads damaged or blocked by rioters and the government wants to make sure the food supply is not disrupted, said Khumbudzo Ntshavheni, an acting minister. Soldiers have been deployed to potential flashpoints and police are providing escorts for the transportation of oxygen, medicines and other key goods, she said. In a 30-minute televised address later on Friday, Mr Ramaphosa said there was no shortage of food or supplies and urged people against panic buying. He said more than 2,500 people had been arrested in connection with the unrest and urged South Africans to come together. ""If we stand together, no insurrection or violence in this country will succeed,"" he said. ""We are engaged in a struggle to defend our democracy, our Constitution, our livelihoods and our safety. ""This is not a battle that we can afford to lose."" Claims about South Africa unrest fact-checked 'I'm struggling to find food after South Africa looting' South Africa mother: Why I threw my baby to strangers Looting and shooting in South Africa 'war zone' Protests began last week after Zuma handed himself in to police to serve a 15-month sentence for contempt of court. Zuma's supporters reacted furiously to his imprisonment, blockading major roads and calling for a shutdown to demand his release. The protests descended into riots on a scale rarely seen in South Africa. Businesses in every sector were looted, burnt and petrol-bombed in cities and towns across KwaZulu-Natal, as well as Gauteng, which surrounds the country's biggest city, Johannesburg.

Activists from the Fridays for Future group in Germany have gone on strike in response to the floods in Europe. The group was set up by the climate activist Greta Thunberg. A post on Twitter announced the strike and said it was to ""fight the climate crisis"". ""Our sympathy and solidarity goes out to all of those affected by the flood
disaster,â the post said. It comes after German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier urged a more ""determined"" action on climate change, following the floods. He said it was the only way to keep that type of extreme weather within limits. This video can not be played What is climate change? German troops have been sent troops to affected areas The floods in the German state of
North-Rhine-Westphalia have been described as a ""disaster of historic
dimensions"" by the state leader. Armin Lachet told reporters that in
some parts the floods had caused ""damage of
unprecedented dimension"". A total of 23 cities and districts in the region have been affected. ""We'll repair houses, rebuild bridges,
repair traffic routes. But the lives lost in the floods are irreplaceable,"" he said. At least 42 deaths have been confirmed in North Rhine-Westphalia. But Lachet said the number was likely to rise. Much of Schuld has been reduced to debris Germans have shared their horror at the speed with which floodwaters engulfed their homes and businesses, devastating many areas near the River Rhine. Some compare the scale of devastation with the pounding that Germany endured in World War Two. And in a reminder of the war, the army is using armoured vehicles to help clear away debris. In the village of Schuld, in the Eifel region, the flash flood ripped buildings apart and tossed cars over, filling the streets with piles of debris and thick layers of mud. Towns near the old West German capital Bonn are among the worst hit Tearful 76-year-old resident Marlene Wiechmann said the last time Schuld experienced such catastrophic flooding was in 1910. It was such a shock to the community that it became part of local folklore for generations. ""Everything broken, swept away, it's a catastrophe,"" she told the public broadcaster SWR. ""Our tennis courts were over there, the house of Stanni from Poland was over there,"" she said, pointing to a tangle of mud, smashed trees and wreckage. Read our full story. If youâre just joining us, here are
the latest headlines as several European countries respond to the worst flooding in decades: Hundreds of people have been urged to
leave their homes in and around the town of Meerssen in the Netherlands after
flood waters broke through a dyke on Friday. Emergency services warned that flood
waters were approaching surrounding villages and urged people to turn off their
electricity and gas and leave their homes. An online alert told people that there was a ""large hole in the dyke"". It's thought 3,000 people have been affected, Reuters news agency reports. Hundreds of firefighters have been
deployed in Limburg province to help evacuate residents and reinforce buildings. Some houses in the worst-hit areas of the Netherlands have been completely flooded Germans are continuing to assess the damage left in the wake of the deadly flooding. The latest images from the clean-up operation show the ease by which even heavy vehicles were carried and crushed by floodwaters in the town of Bad Neuenahr-Ahrweiler. Vehicles were thrown around like toys in the town A drone shot showed a destroyed car amid muddy graves in the town The clear-up operation could take days - if not weeks The town's main bridge was destroyed by the flooding Bad Neuenahr-Ahrweiler residents have been left stunned by the sheer devastation to their town The number of people killed from the floods in Belgium has risen to 20, with at least another 20 people still missing, Interior Minister Annelies Verlinden says. Prime Minister Alexander De Croo has declared next Tuesday, 20 July, a day of national mourning. ""We're still waiting for the final toll, but this could be the most catastrophic flooding our country has ever seen,"" he said. Earlier, media reports suggested that 23 people had already been confirmed dead. Roger HarrabinBBC environment analyst Top climate scientists have admitted they failed to predictthe intensity of the German floods and the North American heat dome. They've correctly warned over decades that a fast-warming climate would bring worse bursts of rain and more damaging heatwaves. But they say their computers are not powerful enough to accurately project the severity of those extremes. They want governments to spend big on a shared climate super-computer. Computers are fundamental to weather forecasting and climate change, and computing will underpin the new climate science ""Bible"", from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) next month. But former Met Office chief scientist Prof Dame Julia Slingo told the BBC: ""We should be alarmed because the IPCC [climate computer] models are just not good enough. ""[We need] an international centre to deliver the quantum leap to climate models that capture the fundamental physics that drive extremes. ""Unless we do that we will continue to underestimate the intensity/frequency of extremes and the increasingly unprecedented nature of them."" The German military has now deployed about 850 troops to help in flood-impacted areas in the south-west of the country. A defence ministry spokesman said the number was ""rising significantly because the need is growing"". Arne Collatz said officials had triggered a ""military disaster alarm"", a move that decentralises decisions on using equipment to individual commanders on the ground. Kaan Polat was staying with family in Poulseur, Germany, when the floods hit overnight Wednesday. He told the BBC how they woke up at 04:00 yesterday to find the local river had risen in heavy rains and completely submerged their home's ground floor. My family have lived there since 1984 and they have never seen anything like that - the intensity, the speed, they were caught completely off guard.  Polat said he and neighbours tried to help each other - including by kayaking with food - as they waited for emergency service help. He was eventually rescued along with his family last night, as he told us in a phone interview today. For some people, the current was so strong only helicopters could get to them - so some people had to spend another night there, but I'm not sure what happened after.  BBC Weather It has been reported that some parts of south-west Germany recorded in excess of 150mm of rain in 24 hours, most of which fell in just a 12-hour time frame. To give an idea of how much that is, the city of Mannheim usually receives close to 70mm in an average July. The worst of the rain has now eased. However, the weather system responsible is now drifting its way southwards and
eastwards, threatening some heavy downpours and thunderstorms to other parts of
Europe. The focus on Friday will be across
parts of the Alps, southern Germany, Italy and across into the Balkans and
Poland. Similar areas will see bouts of heavy rain and thunderstorms heading
into Saturday whilst the emphasis shifts that little bit further south and east
on Sunday. With such intense rainfall, there will be the threat of some flash
flooding locally, although it is unlikely to be on the scale of the flooding we
have seen this week. This video can not be played More now from Rhineland-Palatinate, where the state leader has warned that the death toll linked to the floods is expected to rise. ""Numerous people are still considered missing,"" Malu Dreyer said. ""We
have 60 dead to mourn at the moment and it's feared that the number will
rise even further. We're not giving up hope, of
course"". She added that the heavy rain hit regions where
typical flood protection is not required. She said that developing new flood
protection concepts would be a priority. ""Yet I would like to say that these floods were so
severe that at some point there were limits to how much protection we could
actually provide,"" she said. Parts of the municipality of Schuld have been devastated One of the worst-hit areas in Germany's Rhineland-Palatinate is the municipality of Schuld, where about 700 people live. Local residents say they have been stunned by the force of the water. Frank Thel told Reuters news agency: There wasn't anything left that could be broken. Half the town is destroyed. It was terrible not to be able to help people. They were waving at us out of the windows.  Houses were collapsing to the left and right of them and in the house in between they were waving and luckily they survived.  Another local resident, who identified himself simply as Larscheid, said: The water came so fast, I've never seen anything like that. We were on the bridge down there and I thought, this might be getting tight, and then it was over, the water rose and rose continually, and I realised, it's useless now to try save anything. Car, gone, all gone, digger, gone, it was all gone.  The water had such enormous power! We were in the house, it blew the door open and I was thrown against the chimney-stove. That's how much pressure the water had when filling the house.  This video can not be played German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier has urged a more ""determined"" action on climate change, following the deadly flooding in the western states of his country. He said that was the only way to keep that type of extreme weather within limits. Steinmeier also said he was stunned by the suffering and damage caused by the floods, and warned that many people would need help long after the floodwaters had gone. ""The water is receding. The full extent of the disaster is only now becoming clear,"" the president said. ""Perhaps, in a few days' time, the terrible pictures of the flooding will not dominate the news - but that is exactly when people in the flooded areas will most need our continued support. We must not disappoint them."" Roads have been left completely destroyed by the floods in Schuld, Germany Flood damage in Schuld, Germany A mobile flood barrier has been installed in Lucern, Switzerland The Belgian city of LiÃ¨ge has also been hit by heavy flooding with the mayor telling people to leave if they can Flash floods in Germany have destroyed buildings and swept away cars Welcome to our coverage of the extreme weather disaster in Europe: Ursula von der Leyen (left) was speaking during a visit to Dublin European Commission President Ursula
von der Leyen has become the latest politician from Germany to call for urgent action to tackle global warming in the wake of the deadly flooding in western Europe. ""It is the intensity and the length of the events that
science tells us this is a clear indication of climate change
and that this is something that really, really shows the urgency
to act,"" she told reporters during a visit to Dublin, the capital of the Republic of Ireland. We reported earlier that similar appeals were made by the leaders of the two German states worst hit by the flooding(see our 10:47 post). Â© 2025 BBC.

Science failed to predict flood and heat intensity,"Germany has taken the brunt of the flooding across central Europe Top climate scientists have admitted they failed to predict the intensity of the German floods and the North American heat dome. They've correctly warned over decades that a fast-warming climate would bring worse bursts of rain and more damaging heatwaves. But they say their computers are not powerful enough to accurately project the severity of those extremes. They want governments to spend big on a shared climate super-computer. Computers are fundamental to weather forecasting and climate change, and computing will underpin the new climate science âBibleâ, from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) next month. More than 100 confirmed dead in German floods Why North America's killer heat scares me Record heat points to 'extraordinary' extremes But former Met Office chief scientist Prof Dame Julia Slingo told BBC News: ""We should be alarmed because the IPCC (climate computer) models are just not good enough. ""(We need) an international centre to deliver the quantum leap to climate models that capture the fundamental physics that drive extremes. ""Unless we do that we will continue to underestimate the intensity/frequency of extremes and the increasingly unprecedented nature of them."" She said the costs of the computer, which would be in the hundreds of millions of pounds, would ""pale into insignificance"" compared with the costs of extreme events for which society is unprepared. Dame Julia is striving to promote this initiative at the COP26 climate summit in November. She, and other scientists, agree climate change is an emergency. But Oxford Prof Tim Palmer told me: ""Itâs is impossible to say how much of an emergency we are in because we donât have the tools to answer the question. ""We need a commitment and vision with the magnitude of CERN (Europe's major physics research centre) if we are to build climate models that can accurately simulate the extremes of climate like the Canadian heatwave."" Canada's heatwave has been accompanied by the inevitable wildfires Most importantly researchers need to assess whether places such as North America or Germany will face extremes like the heat dome and the floods every 20 years, 10 years, five years â or maybe even every year. This level of accuracy currently isnât possible. Some scientists argue that it's futile to wait for the IPCC to say how bad climate change will be. That's partly because the panel's ""Bible"", which is supposed to gather in one place the sum of knowledge on climate change, will actually already be out of date when itâs published because review deadlines closed before the German and American extreme extremes (sic). Prof Bill McGuire, for instance, from UCL, told me: ""The obvious acceleration of the breakdown of our stable climate simply confirms that - when it comes to the climate emergency - we are in deep, deep s***! ""Many in the climate science community would agree, in private if not in public. ""The IPCC's reports tend to be both conservative and consensus. Theyâre conservative, because insufficient attention has been given to the importance of tipping points, feedback loops and outlier predictions; consensus, because more extreme scenarios have tended to be marginalised. ""Plenty of peer-reviewed papers not addressed in IPCC documentation present far more pessimistic scenarios. There is no reason why a consensus viewpoint should be right, and we need to be preparing for the worst, even if we still hope for the best."" Cows cool off in a pond to beat the heat wave in Larkana, Pakistan, in June Cambridge Prof Mike Hulme is worried by this tone. He told me: ""It's well known that the IPCC works on a slower timescale than does the weather - and for good reason. ""Science takes time to mature, and for uncertainties to be properly contextualised. I think it is dangerous if people start trying to undermine IPCC reports before they are even published,"" he told me. ""Yes, there are weather extremes and some of them â like heatwaves and some hurricane intensities - are getting more extreme, but this is all predictable according to IPCC models. ""I think it is dangerous to start banging the drum for more and more emergency talk. ""We have seen the damage emergencies can do with the pandemic, fuelled by the psychology of fear throughthe social amplification of risk,external. ""It's a politically dangerous game to start playing."" Meanwhile, the former UK government chief scientist, Prof Sir David King, recently set up the Climate Change Advisory Group to fill the gaps he believes are left by IPCC science. One group member, Prof Mark Maslin from UCL, said of the IPCC: ""The executive summary has to be agreed and signed off by 193 countries; reports are every 6-7 years and because of the time they take to write they are usually 1-2 years behind the literature. ""Are they still fit for purpose - yes, as they provide an essential service linking scientists, social scientists and economists all around the world and provide the baseline estimates of what will happen to governments and companies. ""Are they fit for dealing with a rapidly evolving climate and political landscape - No!â Follow Roger on Twitter @rharrabin,external LA officials giving update on wildfires as firefighters struggle to contain blazes Powerful images of loss and heroism from LA Donald Trump spared prison or fine as judge sentences him in historic NY case What's the latest on the Los Angeles wildfires and what caused them?

Green Man festival to return next monthThe sold-out festival will welcome back revellers to the Black Mountains from 19 to 22 August.Wales,"The festival is set in the Brecon Beacons National Park One of Wales' largest music festivals has been given the green light to go ahead next month, following a further easing of Covid restrictions. The Green Man festival will welcome people back to the Black Mountains in Powys on 19 August for its 19th year. Tickets have sold out for acts including former Super Furry Animals frontman Gruff Rhys, Charlotte Church and Irish post-punk band Fontaines DC. Local businesses are looking forward to 20,000 people descending on the area. Covid gig experiment brings the good times back Wales' lockdown festival 'to bring much needed joy' Eid marked in first pilot Covid event for crowds Held in the Brecon Beacons National Park, the festival, as its name suggests, prides itself on its green credentials.

These range from using recyclable items such as cups and powering the stages from the sun and other renewable sources. It started off in Hay-on-Wye - another Powys town which is famous for a different type of festival - drawing hundreds of people in over three years from 2003. Charlotte Church is bringing her Late Night Pop Dungeon to the festival However, it was in 2006 when it moved to the Glanusk Estate near Crickhowell that it really took off - with numbers attending growing to 20,000. This year, revellers can experience 10 areas, and as well as the music, there will be stages for comedy, literature, mindfulness, theatre and contemporary dance. One of the more intimate stages at the festival in 2017 It is the only major UK music festival to have a female director - Fiona Stewart -  with controlling ownership, and is estimated to contribute Â£10.4m to the Welsh economy each year. Taking centre stage will be Swedish electronic act Little Dragon, with the quartet from Gothenburg headlining along with Scottish post-rockers Mogwai and Irish post-punk act Fontaines DC. Singer Yukimi Nagano of Little Dragon will take centre stage Formed in Dublin in 2017, the Mercury Prize and Grammy-nominated outfit, who won BBC 6 Music's album of the year in 2019, are set to close the festival on 22 August. The fourth headliner is Caribou - the stage name of Canadian Dan Snaith - who has enjoyed much critical acclaim, including 2014 album Our Love being named the IMPALA album of the year. Other acts that will be more familiar to a Welsh audience include Charlotte Church and Gruff Rhys, who has had a long career both with the Super Furry Animals, as a solo artist and through other collaborations such as Neon Neon. Fontaines DC formed after the band's members bonded over a love of poetry Former Welsh Music Prize winner Gwenno and harpist Catrin Finch will also perform. It is nestled in the the Black Mountains, in the Brecon Beacons National Park. Abergavenny and Crickhowell are nearby, with businesses looking forward to the boost to the local economy usually brought by the festival. The nearby town of Crickhowell is looking forward to welcoming visitors from the festival Buster Grant, head brewer of Brecon Brewing, said the Green Man festival had been ""very important"" over the years to his business. ""Events have a twofold impact - there's the financial gain, so not having those events made a big dent in our sales and turnover,"" he said. ""The other one is public perception - so getting out to those events and we probably see something like 2,000 people. ""We hopefully keep a lot of them very happy with the sales of our beer, so [without the festival] those onward sales weren't happening."" Buster Grant says his brewing business loses out without events Mr Grant said his company lost 90% of its business overnight when the first lockdown happened, and developed 19 new beers and ciders in bottles and cans for people to drink at home. His company has also began working with the Welsh Rugby Union to supply beer and cider, and is in discussions with the Football Association of Wales.

Baby injured in Asda ceiling collapse,"Scarlett Phillips says there was a ""horrendous noise"" when the ceiling caved in A baby has been taken to hospital after part of the ceiling collapsed at an Asda supermarket. Emergency services were called to the store on Cavendish Street in Ashton-Under-Lyne, Greater Manchester at about 16:35 BST on Thursday. ""The noise was horrendous, there was dust everywhere,"" said witness Scarlett Phillips. ""A baby was screaming."" A woman and two young children were taken to hospital, Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service confirmed. An Asda spokesman said the family had gone to hospital as a precaution, adding: ""We are pleased to hear they are all ok."" Ms Phillips, 31, from Dukinfield in Tameside said: ""The roof started peeling towards us, the noise was horrendous. ""Then there was dust everywhere and a baby screaming... It shook everyone up but we've peeled the plaster off and been back this morning."" She praised Asda staff who had been ""fantastic and checking how everyone was"". North West Ambulance Service (NWAS) said an infant was treated at the scene before being taken to hospital. A fire service spokeswoman said firefighters were at the scene for about two hours. ""A full evacuation of the store took place while fire crews made the scene safe,"" she said. ""Three casualties - a woman and two young children - were transferred to the care of colleagues from NWAS and conveyed to hospital."" The supermarket said it was ""continuing to work with the relevant authorities"" as an investigation continued into how ""a small section of the ceiling"" had collapsed.

Covid hospital numbers could get scary - Whitty,"The UK is ""not out of the woods yet"" and people should act with caution as Covid restrictions in England end on Monday, Prof Chris Whitty has said. England's chief medical officer warned that Covid hospitalisations were doubling every three weeks and could hit ""scary numbers"" in future. Prof Whitty said the pandemic still had a ""long way to run in the UK"". Solicitor General Lucy Frazer said while cases will rise, there were ""consequences for not opening up"". But she warned: ""Of course, if we get into a situation where it is unacceptable and we do need to put back further restrictions, then that of course is something the government will look at."" It comes as: the Office for National Statistics (ONS) estimated 577,700 people in the community had Covid in Englandin the week ending 10 July - equal to one in 95 people the UK recorded almost 50,000 new cases on Thursday - the highest daily number since January more than half a million self-isolation alertswere sent to people using the NHS Covid-19 app in England and Wales during the first week of July - a rise of 46% on the previous week Meat processorswarned of product shortages due to staff absences, driven by ""pings"" sent from the app The ONS figures for England represent a rise on the previous week, when one in 160 people were estimated to have the virus. Prof Whitty told an online seminar hosted by the Science Museum on Thursday evening that the situation in the UK could become very dangerous for individual hospitals. He said: ""I don't think we should underestimate the fact that we could get into trouble again surprisingly fast. ""I think saying the numbers in hospital are low now, that does not mean the numbers will be low in hospital in five, six, seven, eight weeks' time. ""They could actually be really quite serious."" Where will I need to keep wearing a mask... and why? How are Covid rules changing on Monday? Sainsbury's and Tesco to encourage mask-wearing He added: ""We've still got 2,000 people in hospital and that number is increasing. If we double from 2,000 to 4,000 from 4,000 to 8,000, 8,000 and so on it doesn't take many doubling times until you're in very, very large numbers indeed."" While Prof Whitty cautioned ""we are not by any means out of the woods yet"", he added that ""we are in much better shape due to the vaccine programme, and drugs, and a variety of other things"". ""But this has got a long way to run in the UK, and it's got even further to run globally,"" he said. Prof Whitty warned the doubling rate could see the situation become dangerous for individual hospitals But Prof Whitty said it was crucial that from 19 July in England, people ""take things incredibly slowly"" - adding that he anticipated most people would still take precautions. ""If you look over what people have done, and in fact if you look at what people intend to do now, people have been incredibly good at saying, 'I may be a relatively low risk, but people around me are at high risk, and I'm going to modify my behaviours, I'm going to reduce my contacts, I'm going to improve ventilation...',"" he said. From 19 July,almost all legal restrictions on social contact will be removed in England, but some guidance will remain. Different rules apply in the the rest of the UK. Nightclubs will be allowed to reopen for the first time since March last year and capacity limits will be removed for all venues and events. There will no longer be any limits on how many people can meet and the 1m-plus distancing rule will also end. The legal requirement to wear face coverings in some enclosed public places will expire, but Health Secretary Sajid Javid has previously said masks would still be ""expected and recommended"" in crowded indoor areas.

NHS Covid app pings more than 500,000 in a week Covid staff shortage could shut meat production Should I be working at home or going to the office? Prof Whitty predicted that in the medium term, coronavirus could mutate into a ""vaccine escape variant"" that could take the UK ""some of the way backwards"" into the worst days of the pandemic. ""The further out in time we go, the more tools we have at our disposal from science, the less likely that is but you can never take that possibility completely off the table,"" he said. ""But you know, science has done a phenomenal job so far and it will continue to do so."" Prof Whitty's comments echo his statements at Monday's Downing Street coronavirus briefing where Prime Minister Boris Johnson confirmed the final stage of unlocking in England would take place on 19 July. The chief medical officer said the ""overwhelming view"" of the scientific community was that moving ""slowly"" through the next step of easing restrictions was ""essential"". He added that while the numbers of people being admitted to hospital with Covid were ""not trivial"", they were rising at a much lower rate than previous waves. Explaining the government's approach, Ms Frazer told Sky News: ""It is really important that we get the balance right between ensuring that we keep this virus under control and we take the necessary clinical measures to do that, but that we also recognise that there are consequences of not opening up and not allowing people to go about their daily lives.""

"Covid hospital numbers could get scary - WhittyIt comes as the UK recorded almost 50,000 new cases on Thursday - the highest number since January.UKComments","The UK is ""not out of the woods yet"" and people should act with caution as Covid restrictions in England end on Monday, Prof Chris Whitty has said. England's chief medical officer warned that Covid hospitalisations were doubling every three weeks and could hit ""scary numbers"" in future. Prof Whitty said the pandemic still had a ""long way to run in the UK"". Solicitor General Lucy Frazer said while cases will rise, there were ""consequences for not opening up"". But she warned: ""Of course, if we get into a situation where it is unacceptable and we do need to put back further restrictions, then that of course is something the government will look at."" It comes as: the Office for National Statistics (ONS) estimated 577,700 people in the community had Covid in Englandin the week ending 10 July - equal to one in 95 people the UK recorded almost 50,000 new cases on Thursday - the highest daily number since January more than half a million self-isolation alertswere sent to people using the NHS Covid-19 app in England and Wales during the first week of July - a rise of 46% on the previous week Meat processorswarned of product shortages due to staff absences, driven by ""pings"" sent from the app The ONS figures for England represent a rise on the previous week, when one in 160 people were estimated to have the virus. Prof Whitty told an online seminar hosted by the Science Museum on Thursday evening that the situation in the UK could become very dangerous for individual hospitals. He said: ""I don't think we should underestimate the fact that we could get into trouble again surprisingly fast. ""I think saying the numbers in hospital are low now, that does not mean the numbers will be low in hospital in five, six, seven, eight weeks' time. ""They could actually be really quite serious."" Where will I need to keep wearing a mask... and why? How are Covid rules changing on Monday? Sainsbury's and Tesco to encourage mask-wearing He added: ""We've still got 2,000 people in hospital and that number is increasing. If we double from 2,000 to 4,000 from 4,000 to 8,000, 8,000 and so on it doesn't take many doubling times until you're in very, very large numbers indeed.""

Motorway to stay closed as crash fatalities fearedPeople are feared dead after a lorry caught fire and cars crashed in County Durham on Thursday.Tyne & Wear,"Police crash investigators have been at the scene of the crash on the A1(M) in County Durham throughout Friday Three people have died in a crash on the A1(M) which involved six vehicles, police said. Two lorries and four cars were caught up in the crash at Bowburn, County Durham, at about 18:20 BST on Thursday. Durham Police said three people from two of the cars died at the scene. A man, 41, who was driving one of the lorries has been arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving, the force said. A man who was driving a Toyota Hilux and a man and woman from a Vauxhall Crossland all died at the scene. A police spokeswoman said formal identification was expected ""to take some time"" but families had been informed. Several others were injured in the collision, with two people requiring hospital treatment, she said. The spokeswoman said: ""Due to the complexity of the scene, there is ongoing work to safely recover evidence and remove vehicles which will take some time."" Det Supt Dave Ashton said it was a ""harrowing incident"" and has been ""incredibly upsetting and distressing for those who witnessed the collision, and for the emergency responders, including police officers, firefighters and paramedics, who attended the scene"". ""Our thoughts are with the family and friends of those who have lost their loved ones,"" Mr Ashton said. He also urged members of the public not to share pictures or videos of the crash online ""out of dignity and respect for those who have lost their lives"". The Great North Air Ambulance was called to the scene, as well as police, paramedics and firefighters Mr Ashton said the road would stay shut for the rest of the day and would need to be assessed for damage before it could be opened. ""Motorists should avoid the area and plan ahead if they need to travel,"" he said. ""We understand the significant disruption that this incident has caused, and would like to thank people for their patience, understanding and co-operation while we work at the scene.""

Activists from the Fridays for Future group in Germany have gone on strike in response to the floods in Europe. The group was set up by the climate activist Greta Thunberg. A post on Twitter announced the strike and said it was to ""fight the climate crisis"". ""Our sympathy and solidarity goes out to all of those affected by the flood
disaster,â the post said. It comes after German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier urged a more ""determined"" action on climate change, following the floods. He said it was the only way to keep that type of extreme weather within limits. This video can not be played What is climate change? German troops have been sent troops to affected areas The floods in the German state of
North-Rhine-Westphalia have been described as a ""disaster of historic
dimensions"" by the state leader. Armin Lachet told reporters that in
some parts the floods had caused ""damage of
unprecedented dimension"". A total of 23 cities and districts in the region have been affected. ""We'll repair houses, rebuild bridges,
repair traffic routes. But the lives lost in the floods are irreplaceable,"" he said. At least 42 deaths have been confirmed in North Rhine-Westphalia. But Lachet said the number was likely to rise. Much of Schuld has been reduced to debris Germans have shared their horror at the speed with which floodwaters engulfed their homes and businesses, devastating many areas near the River Rhine. Some compare the scale of devastation with the pounding that Germany endured in World War Two. And in a reminder of the war, the army is using armoured vehicles to help clear away debris. In the village of Schuld, in the Eifel region, the flash flood ripped buildings apart and tossed cars over, filling the streets with piles of debris and thick layers of mud. Towns near the old West German capital Bonn are among the worst hit Tearful 76-year-old resident Marlene Wiechmann said the last time Schuld experienced such catastrophic flooding was in 1910. It was such a shock to the community that it became part of local folklore for generations. ""Everything broken, swept away, it's a catastrophe,"" she told the public broadcaster SWR. ""Our tennis courts were over there, the house of Stanni from Poland was over there,"" she said, pointing to a tangle of mud, smashed trees and wreckage. Read our full story. If youâre just joining us, here are
the latest headlines as several European countries respond to the worst flooding in decades: Hundreds of people have been urged to
leave their homes in and around the town of Meerssen in the Netherlands after
flood waters broke through a dyke on Friday. Emergency services warned that flood
waters were approaching surrounding villages and urged people to turn off their
electricity and gas and leave their homes. An online alert told people that there was a ""large hole in the dyke"". It's thought 3,000 people have been affected, Reuters news agency reports. Hundreds of firefighters have been
deployed in Limburg province to help evacuate residents and reinforce buildings. Some houses in the worst-hit areas of the Netherlands have been completely flooded Germans are continuing to assess the damage left in the wake of the deadly flooding. The latest images from the clean-up operation show the ease by which even heavy vehicles were carried and crushed by floodwaters in the town of Bad Neuenahr-Ahrweiler. Vehicles were thrown around like toys in the town A drone shot showed a destroyed car amid muddy graves in the town The clear-up operation could take days - if not weeks The town's main bridge was destroyed by the flooding Bad Neuenahr-Ahrweiler residents have been left stunned by the sheer devastation to their town The number of people killed from the floods in Belgium has risen to 20, with at least another 20 people still missing, Interior Minister Annelies Verlinden says. Prime Minister Alexander De Croo has declared next Tuesday, 20 July, a day of national mourning. ""We're still waiting for the final toll, but this could be the most catastrophic flooding our country has ever seen,"" he said. Earlier, media reports suggested that 23 people had already been confirmed dead. Roger HarrabinBBC environment analyst Top climate scientists have admitted they failed to predictthe intensity of the German floods and the North American heat dome. They've correctly warned over decades that a fast-warming climate would bring worse bursts of rain and more damaging heatwaves. But they say their computers are not powerful enough to accurately project the severity of those extremes. They want governments to spend big on a shared climate super-computer. Computers are fundamental to weather forecasting and climate change, and computing will underpin the new climate science ""Bible"", from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) next month. But former Met Office chief scientist Prof Dame Julia Slingo told the BBC: ""We should be alarmed because the IPCC [climate computer] models are just not good enough. ""[We need] an international centre to deliver the quantum leap to climate models that capture the fundamental physics that drive extremes. ""Unless we do that we will continue to underestimate the intensity/frequency of extremes and the increasingly unprecedented nature of them."" The German military has now deployed about 850 troops to help in flood-impacted areas in the south-west of the country. A defence ministry spokesman said the number was ""rising significantly because the need is growing"". Arne Collatz said officials had triggered a ""military disaster alarm"", a move that decentralises decisions on using equipment to individual commanders on the ground. Kaan Polat was staying with family in Poulseur, Germany, when the floods hit overnight Wednesday. He told the BBC how they woke up at 04:00 yesterday to find the local river had risen in heavy rains and completely submerged their home's ground floor. My family have lived there since 1984 and they have never seen anything like that - the intensity, the speed, they were caught completely off guard.  Polat said he and neighbours tried to help each other - including by kayaking with food - as they waited for emergency service help. He was eventually rescued along with his family last night, as he told us in a phone interview today. For some people, the current was so strong only helicopters could get to them - so some people had to spend another night there, but I'm not sure what happened after.  BBC Weather It has been reported that some parts of south-west Germany recorded in excess of 150mm of rain in 24 hours, most of which fell in just a 12-hour time frame. To give an idea of how much that is, the city of Mannheim usually receives close to 70mm in an average July. The worst of the rain has now eased. However, the weather system responsible is now drifting its way southwards and
eastwards, threatening some heavy downpours and thunderstorms to other parts of
Europe. The focus on Friday will be across
parts of the Alps, southern Germany, Italy and across into the Balkans and
Poland. Similar areas will see bouts of heavy rain and thunderstorms heading
into Saturday whilst the emphasis shifts that little bit further south and east
on Sunday. With such intense rainfall, there will be the threat of some flash
flooding locally, although it is unlikely to be on the scale of the flooding we
have seen this week. This video can not be played More now from Rhineland-Palatinate, where the state leader has warned that the death toll linked to the floods is expected to rise. ""Numerous people are still considered missing,"" Malu Dreyer said. ""We
have 60 dead to mourn at the moment and it's feared that the number will
rise even further. We're not giving up hope, of
course"". She added that the heavy rain hit regions where
typical flood protection is not required. She said that developing new flood
protection concepts would be a priority. ""Yet I would like to say that these floods were so
severe that at some point there were limits to how much protection we could
actually provide,"" she said. Parts of the municipality of Schuld have been devastated One of the worst-hit areas in Germany's Rhineland-Palatinate is the municipality of Schuld, where about 700 people live. Local residents say they have been stunned by the force of the water. Frank Thel told Reuters news agency: There wasn't anything left that could be broken. Half the town is destroyed. It was terrible not to be able to help people. They were waving at us out of the windows.  Houses were collapsing to the left and right of them and in the house in between they were waving and luckily they survived.  Another local resident, who identified himself simply as Larscheid, said: The water came so fast, I've never seen anything like that. We were on the bridge down there and I thought, this might be getting tight, and then it was over, the water rose and rose continually, and I realised, it's useless now to try save anything. Car, gone, all gone, digger, gone, it was all gone.  The water had such enormous power! We were in the house, it blew the door open and I was thrown against the chimney-stove. That's how much pressure the water had when filling the house.  This video can not be played German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier has urged a more ""determined"" action on climate change, following the deadly flooding in the western states of his country. He said that was the only way to keep that type of extreme weather within limits. Steinmeier also said he was stunned by the suffering and damage caused by the floods, and warned that many people would need help long after the floodwaters had gone. ""The water is receding. The full extent of the disaster is only now becoming clear,"" the president said. ""Perhaps, in a few days' time, the terrible pictures of the flooding will not dominate the news - but that is exactly when people in the flooded areas will most need our continued support. We must not disappoint them."" Roads have been left completely destroyed by the floods in Schuld, Germany Flood damage in Schuld, Germany A mobile flood barrier has been installed in Lucern, Switzerland The Belgian city of LiÃ¨ge has also been hit by heavy flooding with the mayor telling people to leave if they can Flash floods in Germany have destroyed buildings and swept away cars Welcome to our coverage of the extreme weather disaster in Europe: Ursula von der Leyen (left) was speaking during a visit to Dublin European Commission President Ursula
von der Leyen has become the latest politician from Germany to call for urgent action to tackle global warming in the wake of the deadly flooding in western Europe. ""It is the intensity and the length of the events that
science tells us this is a clear indication of climate change
and that this is something that really, really shows the urgency
to act,"" she told reporters during a visit to Dublin, the capital of the Republic of Ireland. We reported earlier that similar appeals were made by the leaders of the two German states worst hit by the flooding(see our 10:47 post). Â© 2025 BBC.

Towns near the old West German capital Bonn are among the worst hit Tearful 76-year-old resident Marlene Wiechmann said the last time Schuld experienced such catastrophic flooding was in 1910. It was such a shock to the community that it became part of local folklore for generations. ""Everything broken, swept away, it's a catastrophe,"" she told the public broadcaster SWR. ""Our tennis courts were over there, the house of Stanni from Poland was over there,"" she said, pointing to a tangle of mud, smashed trees and wreckage. Read our full story. If youâre just joining us, here are
the latest headlines as several European countries respond to the worst flooding in decades: Hundreds of people have been urged to
leave their homes in and around the town of Meerssen in the Netherlands after
flood waters broke through a dyke on Friday. Emergency services warned that flood
waters were approaching surrounding villages and urged people to turn off their
electricity and gas and leave their homes. An online alert told people that there was a ""large hole in the dyke"". It's thought 3,000 people have been affected, Reuters news agency reports. Hundreds of firefighters have been
deployed in Limburg province to help evacuate residents and reinforce buildings. Some houses in the worst-hit areas of the Netherlands have been completely flooded Germans are continuing to assess the damage left in the wake of the deadly flooding. The latest images from the clean-up operation show the ease by which even heavy vehicles were carried and crushed by floodwaters in the town of Bad Neuenahr-Ahrweiler. Vehicles were thrown around like toys in the town A drone shot showed a destroyed car amid muddy graves in the town The clear-up operation could take days - if not weeks The town's main bridge was destroyed by the flooding Bad Neuenahr-Ahrweiler residents have been left stunned by the sheer devastation to their town The number of people killed from the floods in Belgium has risen to 20, with at least another 20 people still missing, Interior Minister Annelies Verlinden says. Prime Minister Alexander De Croo has declared next Tuesday, 20 July, a day of national mourning. ""We're still waiting for the final toll, but this could be the most catastrophic flooding our country has ever seen,"" he said. Earlier, media reports suggested that 23 people had already been confirmed dead. Roger HarrabinBBC environment analyst Top climate scientists have admitted they failed to predictthe intensity of the German floods and the North American heat dome. They've correctly warned over decades that a fast-warming climate would bring worse bursts of rain and more damaging heatwaves. But they say their computers are not powerful enough to accurately project the severity of those extremes. They want governments to spend big on a shared climate super-computer. Computers are fundamental to weather forecasting and climate change, and computing will underpin the new climate science ""Bible"", from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) next month. But former Met Office chief scientist Prof Dame Julia Slingo told the BBC: ""We should be alarmed because the IPCC [climate computer] models are just not good enough. ""[We need] an international centre to deliver the quantum leap to climate models that capture the fundamental physics that drive extremes. ""Unless we do that we will continue to underestimate the intensity/frequency of extremes and the increasingly unprecedented nature of them."" The German military has now deployed about 850 troops to help in flood-impacted areas in the south-west of the country. A defence ministry spokesman said the number was ""rising significantly because the need is growing"". Arne Collatz said officials had triggered a ""military disaster alarm"", a move that decentralises decisions on using equipment to individual commanders on the ground. Kaan Polat was staying with family in Poulseur, Germany, when the floods hit overnight Wednesday. He told the BBC how they woke up at 04:00 yesterday to find the local river had risen in heavy rains and completely submerged their home's ground floor. My family have lived there since 1984 and they have never seen anything like that - the intensity, the speed, they were caught completely off guard.  Polat said he and neighbours tried to help each other - including by kayaking with food - as they waited for emergency service help. He was eventually rescued along with his family last night, as he told us in a phone interview today. For some people, the current was so strong only helicopters could get to them - so some people had to spend another night there, but I'm not sure what happened after.  BBC Weather It has been reported that some parts of south-west Germany recorded in excess of 150mm of rain in 24 hours, most of which fell in just a 12-hour time frame. To give an idea of how much that is, the city of Mannheim usually receives close to 70mm in an average July. The worst of the rain has now eased. However, the weather system responsible is now drifting its way southwards and
eastwards, threatening some heavy downpours and thunderstorms to other parts of
Europe. The focus on Friday will be across
parts of the Alps, southern Germany, Italy and across into the Balkans and
Poland. Similar areas will see bouts of heavy rain and thunderstorms heading
into Saturday whilst the emphasis shifts that little bit further south and east
on Sunday. With such intense rainfall, there will be the threat of some flash
flooding locally, although it is unlikely to be on the scale of the flooding we
have seen this week. This video can not be played More now from Rhineland-Palatinate, where the state leader has warned that the death toll linked to the floods is expected to rise. ""Numerous people are still considered missing,"" Malu Dreyer said. ""We
have 60 dead to mourn at the moment and it's feared that the number will
rise even further. We're not giving up hope, of
course"". She added that the heavy rain hit regions where
typical flood protection is not required. She said that developing new flood
protection concepts would be a priority. ""Yet I would like to say that these floods were so
severe that at some point there were limits to how much protection we could
actually provide,"" she said. Parts of the municipality of Schuld have been devastated One of the worst-hit areas in Germany's Rhineland-Palatinate is the municipality of Schuld, where about 700 people live. Local residents say they have been stunned by the force of the water. Frank Thel told Reuters news agency: There wasn't anything left that could be broken. Half the town is destroyed. It was terrible not to be able to help people. They were waving at us out of the windows.  Houses were collapsing to the left and right of them and in the house in between they were waving and luckily they survived.  Another local resident, who identified himself simply as Larscheid, said: The water came so fast, I've never seen anything like that. We were on the bridge down there and I thought, this might be getting tight, and then it was over, the water rose and rose continually, and I realised, it's useless now to try save anything. Car, gone, all gone, digger, gone, it was all gone.  The water had such enormous power! We were in the house, it blew the door open and I was thrown against the chimney-stove. That's how much pressure the water had when filling the house.  This video can not be played German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier has urged a more ""determined"" action on climate change, following the deadly flooding in the western states of his country. He said that was the only way to keep that type of extreme weather within limits. Steinmeier also said he was stunned by the suffering and damage caused by the floods, and warned that many people would need help long after the floodwaters had gone. ""The water is receding. The full extent of the disaster is only now becoming clear,"" the president said. ""Perhaps, in a few days' time, the terrible pictures of the flooding will not dominate the news - but that is exactly when people in the flooded areas will most need our continued support. We must not disappoint them."" Roads have been left completely destroyed by the floods in Schuld, Germany Flood damage in Schuld, Germany A mobile flood barrier has been installed in Lucern, Switzerland The Belgian city of LiÃ¨ge has also been hit by heavy flooding with the mayor telling people to leave if they can Flash floods in Germany have destroyed buildings and swept away cars Welcome to our coverage of the extreme weather disaster in Europe: Ursula von der Leyen (left) was speaking during a visit to Dublin European Commission President Ursula
von der Leyen has become the latest politician from Germany to call for urgent action to tackle global warming in the wake of the deadly flooding in western Europe. ""It is the intensity and the length of the events that
science tells us this is a clear indication of climate change
and that this is something that really, really shows the urgency
to act,"" she told reporters during a visit to Dublin, the capital of the Republic of Ireland. We reported earlier that similar appeals were made by the leaders of the two German states worst hit by the flooding(see our 10:47 post). Â© 2025 BBC.

Scotland saw 1 in 90 people with the virus last week. Northern Ireland had 1 in 290 and Wales 1 in 360 Edited by John Hand and Daniel Coles We're bringing our live page to a close now. We will be back with all the latest reaction as coronavirus restrictions are eased in England and Scotland on Monday. It promises to be a landmark day in this pandemic. Today's coverage has been written by Emma Harrison and Lauren Turner. It was edited by Dan Coles and John Hand. Thanks for joining us this Friday for our coronavirus live page coverage. Here's a reminder of the main headlines from today: Just a reminder that Health Secretary Sajid Javid had previously warned that case numbers could reach 50,000 a day by 19 July - as they now have. Andearlier this week, he said that the daily coronavirus cases in the UK could reach 100,000 later this summer. But he said he did not think this would put ""unsustainable pressure on the NHS"". That's because vaccinations have created a ""protective wall"" meaning we can ""withstand a summer wave"", he added. Central estimates from modellers advising the government also show that Covid deaths are expected to be between 100 and 200 per day at the peak, although there is a large amount of uncertainty over that.   As we mentioned, today's figure of 51,870 cases is the highest since 15 January. On that day - which was also a Friday - there were 55,761 cases reported in the UK. The highest number of cases recorded in the UK since the pandemic started was also in January. It came on 8 January, when there were 68,053 cases. You can use ourlook-up tool hereto find out how many cases there are in your area now.  James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News Passing 50,000 cases a day feels like a worrying landmark - but is it? We were last at those levels around the peak of the second wave in January when it took a tough lockdown to prevent hospitals buckling. But now more fuel is being thrown on the fireas restrictions easein England and Scotland on Monday, and in Wales from Saturday. Cases will go even higher. How high? Nobody knows for sure. Letting this happen is possible only because vaccines have transformed the danger posed by a summer wave. Without them, weâd be debating locking down. Yet vaccines have not eliminated the Covid threat. Letting the virus spread could still put pressure on hospitals, leave people with long Covid and be hugely disruptive as large numbers of people need to isolate. Reaching 50,000 daily cases doesnât mean the same as it did six months ago - but it doesnât mean it will be smooth sailing. A further 61,681 people have had a first coronavirus vaccine, today's figures show. And another 201,893 have now had their second dose. In total, 87.6% of adults in the UK have had one dose and 67.5% have had two. All the latest on the statistics from the government can be foundhere,external. Cases in the UK have been sharply rising, with figures topping 40,000 on Wednesday - having been over 30,000 every day the previous week. One week ago, last Friday, figures were at 35,707. And if we go back just a month ago to 16 June, daily UK cases were 9,055. If youâre interested in seeing how other countries have fared since easing restrictions, weâve got a feature on thathere. The UK has reported more than 50,000 daily coronavirus cases for the first time since mid-January. There were 51,870 cases recorded, the highest since 15 January, and 49 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. The milestone came just days before the easing of restrictions in England and Scotland on Monday.

It comes as separate Office for National Statistics data estimates1% of people in the UKhad coronavirus last week. The more infectious Delta variant accounts for almost every case. The British Grand Prix returned today and will see thousands of Formula 1 fans descend on Silverstone over the course of the weekend. Seven-time world champion Lewis Hamilton has posted on his Instagram to urge spectators to wear masks and stay safe. ""It was so nice to see everyone today. So refreshing to see
people and the energy already is so uplifting,"" he wrote. ""Can I please ask you to wear
your masks, be safe. I know of people getting Covid and being ill even with

Easing of restrictions are being made in both England and Scotland on Monday. Wales also sees changes on Saturday and Northern Ireland is set to ease rules on 26 July. Here's some of the things that will be changing inEngland:  Meanwhile, inScotland, all areas will be inCovid protection level 0,externalon 19 July. Here are some of the changes:  For a full list of the changes across the UK,you can read our explainer here. We're expecting the UK's latestdaily coronavirus figures,externalin the next hour or so. Thursday's showed there were 48,553 new cases - the highest reported since 15 January - and 63 deaths. Today's could break the 50,000 case barrier as the numbers have been rising sharply in recent weeks. And that would come just three days before England and Scotland are due to further ease coronavirus restrictions -more on that here. England's chief medical officer has warned that the UK is ""not out of the woods"" yet and people need to act with caution as the restrictions end. He warned that Covid hospitalisations were doubling every three weeks and could hit ""scary numbers"" in future. We'll bring you the latest on the figures when we have them. Health bosses in Sunderland have asked staff to postpone holidays as the local trust is ""under extreme pressure"" due to a surge in coronavirus cases. Staff at South Tyneside and Sunderland NHS Foundation Trust, an area which has one of the highest infection rates in the country, are seeing hospital cases double week-on-week. Bosses told staff earlier this week there were 80 patients receiving treatment - while there were just two exactly a month previously. In the internal memo, they asked for staff to work additional shifts, with a Â£250 bonus for staff who could work an extra week of overtime spread over the next six weeks. Dr Shaz Wahid, medical director at the trust, said: ""We are seeing increasing numbers of patients accessing our services and rising admissions due to the current high numbers of Covid-19 in our local community. ""Understandably, this has had an impact on our workforce as well as the wider public. A woman who travelled to Britain from Australia to see her dying father says she is stuck in the UK. Donna Lewis flew from Queensland to North Lincolnshire in February to help her mother with her father's care. After he died in May, aged 88, she arranged return flights to Australia but these were cancelled when the country imposed new Covid restrictions. Mrs Lewis said she had since been quoted Â£7,500 for a one-way ticket on a September flight. Australia halved the number of international arrivalsit would accept after Covid outbreaks put half the population in lockdown and it is only allowing 3,000 citizens a week to return. Read more The NHS contact tracing app remains ""one of the best tools"" to tackle coronavirus, Downing Street has insisted. The prime minister's spokesman told a press briefing that, as cases go up, you'd expect the number of people asked to isolate to increase as well. But he wouldn't be drawn on possible exemptions for specific industries - adding that everything was kept ""under review"". The government is continuing to look at self-isolation requirements for NHS workers who might get pinged by the app while at work. On the possibility of tweaking the app's sensitivity, the spokesman said that the matter is also being kept under review. And he downplayed the possibility of getting pinged through a wall if one of your neighbours tests positive - as wasreported by the Daily Telegraph,external. He said it was ""highly unlikely"" as the app uses low energy Bluetooth, and the government is confident that that's not contributing to a ""large number of individuals being asked to self-isolate"".  As we've heard, some businesses and unions are concerned there will be a surge in staff having to self-isolate when restrictions in England and Scotland are eased further on Monday. UK Hospitality chief executive Kate Nicholls says the industry is facing ""significant staffing challenges"", with up to as many as a fifth of staff isolating at any one time. ""Without better intervention, operators will continue to be forced to reduce their operating hours or to close venues completely, missing the opportunity to begin on their road to recovery,"" she says. ""We urge the government to move quicker on this issue to prevent the summer being cancelled, and vast swathes of the population unnecessarily confined to their homes."" Hugh Osmond, the founder of Punch Taverns, is calling for those pinged on the NHS app to be allowed to go back to work if they get a PCR test that is negative. ""It is absolute chaos, and clearly the app really isn't fit for purpose because people are getting pinged all over the place, and the vast majority do not ever test positive, let alone be ill,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme earlier. Read more The first cruise ship to visit Scotland since the Covid pandemic began isset to arrive in Lerwick Harbour, Sheltand, next week. It comes after the Scottish government lifted a virus-related ban and the reopening of the country's ports to cruise ships on UK-only sailings. Domestic voyages to and from English ports have been operating since mid-May. Operated by Noble Caledonia, the MS Island Sky will berth at Victoria Pier on Monday with 66 passengers on board. The vessel, which is operating at half its capacity, will complete a full circumnavigation of the UK. Last year was expected to be a record year for Shetland with about 100 visits booked. But only two cruise ships docked in February before the pandemic forced Scotland into lockdown. Steve Matheson, Shetland Islands manager for VisitScotland, welcomed the return of cruise ships and said they would provide a financial boost for local bus operators, tour guides, attractions and retailers. The coronavirus reproduction number - or R number - in England remains unchanged from last week and is between 1.2 and 1.4, latest government figures show. Last week, it was between 1.2 and 1.5. The R number represents the average number of people each person with Covid-19 will go on to infect. If the figure is above 1, it means an outbreak is growing, and when it is below 1, it is shrinking. The current R number means that for every 10 people infected, another 12 to 14 other people will go on to get the virus. As England prepares to ease restrictions on Monday, Covid-19 continues to spread around the world, with about 190 million confirmed cases so far and more than four million deaths. The US, India and Brazil have seen the highest number of confirmed cases, followed by France, Russia, Turkey and the UK. Cases - and deaths - have been rising in many countries as the graph below shows.  The UK currently has the highest number of daily cases in Europe, looking at the weekly average.

Currently, from 16 August those who have had two vaccines will no longer have to self-isolate if they get notified they've been in close contact with someone who's tested positive for coronavirus. National newspapers, business owners and some MPs have asked why that rule will be suitable in a month's time but not now - but the government has previously explained that its modelling is based on the current wave of infections peaking in the next few weeks, if self-isolation guidelines stay as they are. Asked if the date was unchanged, a No 10 spokesman said: ""It is as the health secretary set out in the House last week."" Â© 2025 BBC.

In the internal memo, they asked for staff to work additional shifts, with a Â£250 bonus for staff who could work an extra week of overtime spread over the next six weeks. Dr Shaz Wahid, medical director at the trust, said: ""We are seeing increasing numbers of patients accessing our services and rising admissions due to the current high numbers of Covid-19 in our local community. ""Understandably, this has had an impact on our workforce as well as the wider public. A woman who travelled to Britain from Australia to see her dying father says she is stuck in the UK. Donna Lewis flew from Queensland to North Lincolnshire in February to help her mother with her father's care. After he died in May, aged 88, she arranged return flights to Australia but these were cancelled when the country imposed new Covid restrictions. Mrs Lewis said she had since been quoted Â£7,500 for a one-way ticket on a September flight. Australia halved the number of international arrivalsit would accept after Covid outbreaks put half the population in lockdown and it is only allowing 3,000 citizens a week to return.

The prime minister's spokesman told a press briefing that, as cases go up, you'd expect the number of people asked to isolate to increase as well. But he wouldn't be drawn on possible exemptions for specific industries - adding that everything was kept ""under review"". The government is continuing to look at self-isolation requirements for NHS workers who might get pinged by the app while at work. On the possibility of tweaking the app's sensitivity, the spokesman said that the matter is also being kept under review. And he downplayed the possibility of getting pinged through a wall if one of your neighbours tests positive - as wasreported by the Daily Telegraph,external. He said it was ""highly unlikely"" as the app uses low energy Bluetooth, and the government is confident that that's not contributing to a ""large number of individuals being asked to self-isolate"".  As we've heard, some businesses and unions are concerned there will be a surge in staff having to self-isolate when restrictions in England and Scotland are eased further on Monday. UK Hospitality chief executive Kate Nicholls says the industry is facing ""significant staffing challenges"", with up to as many as a fifth of staff isolating at any one time. ""Without better intervention, operators will continue to be forced to reduce their operating hours or to close venues completely, missing the opportunity to begin on their road to recovery,"" she says. ""We urge the government to move quicker on this issue to prevent the summer being cancelled, and vast swathes of the population unnecessarily confined to their homes."" Hugh Osmond, the founder of Punch Taverns, is calling for those pinged on the NHS app to be allowed to go back to work if they get a PCR test that is negative. ""It is absolute chaos, and clearly the app really isn't fit for purpose because people are getting pinged all over the place, and the vast majority do not ever test positive, let alone be ill,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme earlier. Read more The first cruise ship to visit Scotland since the Covid pandemic began isset to arrive in Lerwick Harbour, Sheltand, next week. It comes after the Scottish government lifted a virus-related ban and the reopening of the country's ports to cruise ships on UK-only sailings. Domestic voyages to and from English ports have been operating since mid-May. Operated by Noble Caledonia, the MS Island Sky will berth at Victoria Pier on Monday with 66 passengers on board. The vessel, which is operating at half its capacity, will complete a full circumnavigation of the UK. Last year was expected to be a record year for Shetland with about 100 visits booked. But only two cruise ships docked in February before the pandemic forced Scotland into lockdown. Steve Matheson, Shetland Islands manager for VisitScotland, welcomed the return of cruise ships and said they would provide a financial boost for local bus operators, tour guides, attractions and retailers. The coronavirus reproduction number - or R number - in England remains unchanged from last week and is between 1.2 and 1.4, latest government figures show. Last week, it was between 1.2 and 1.5. The R number represents the average number of people each person with Covid-19 will go on to infect. If the figure is above 1, it means an outbreak is growing, and when it is below 1, it is shrinking. The current R number means that for every 10 people infected, another 12 to 14 other people will go on to get the virus. As England prepares to ease restrictions on Monday, Covid-19 continues to spread around the world, with about 190 million confirmed cases so far and more than four million deaths. The US, India and Brazil have seen the highest number of confirmed cases, followed by France, Russia, Turkey and the UK. Cases - and deaths - have been rising in many countries as the graph below shows.  The UK currently has the highest number of daily cases in Europe, looking at the weekly average.

Currently, from 16 August those who have had two vaccines will no longer have to self-isolate if they get notified they've been in close contact with someone who's tested positive for coronavirus. National newspapers, business owners and some MPs have asked why that rule will be suitable in a month's time but not now - but the government has previously explained that its modelling is based on the current wave of infections peaking in the next few weeks, if self-isolation guidelines stay as they are. Asked if the date was unchanged, a No 10 spokesman said: ""It is as the health secretary set out in the House last week."" Â© 2025 BBC.

We will be back with all the latest reaction as coronavirus restrictions are eased in England and Scotland on Monday. It promises to be a landmark day in this pandemic. Today's coverage has been written by Emma Harrison and Lauren Turner. It was edited by Dan Coles and John Hand. Thanks for joining us this Friday for our coronavirus live page coverage. Here's a reminder of the main headlines from today: Just a reminder that Health Secretary Sajid Javid had previously warned that case numbers could reach 50,000 a day by 19 July - as they now have. Andearlier this week, he said that the daily coronavirus cases in the UK could reach 100,000 later this summer. But he said he did not think this would put ""unsustainable pressure on the NHS"". That's because vaccinations have created a ""protective wall"" meaning we can ""withstand a summer wave"", he added. Central estimates from modellers advising the government also show that Covid deaths are expected to be between 100 and 200 per day at the peak, although there is a large amount of uncertainty over that.   As we mentioned, today's figure of 51,870 cases is the highest since 15 January. On that day - which was also a Friday - there were 55,761 cases reported in the UK. The highest number of cases recorded in the UK since the pandemic started was also in January. It came on 8 January, when there were 68,053 cases. You can use ourlook-up tool hereto find out how many cases there are in your area now.  James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News Passing 50,000 cases a day feels like a worrying landmark - but is it? We were last at those levels around the peak of the second wave in January when it took a tough lockdown to prevent hospitals buckling. But now more fuel is being thrown on the fireas restrictions easein England and Scotland on Monday, and in Wales from Saturday. Cases will go even higher. How high? Nobody knows for sure. Letting this happen is possible only because vaccines have transformed the danger posed by a summer wave. Without them, weâd be debating locking down. Yet vaccines have not eliminated the Covid threat. Letting the virus spread could still put pressure on hospitals, leave people with long Covid and be hugely disruptive as large numbers of people need to isolate. Reaching 50,000 daily cases doesnât mean the same as it did six months ago - but it doesnât mean it will be smooth sailing. A further 61,681 people have had a first coronavirus vaccine, today's figures show. And another 201,893 have now had their second dose. In total, 87.6% of adults in the UK have had one dose and 67.5% have had two. All the latest on the statistics from the government can be foundhere,external. Cases in the UK have been sharply rising, with figures topping 40,000 on Wednesday - having been over 30,000 every day the previous week. One week ago, last Friday, figures were at 35,707. And if we go back just a month ago to 16 June, daily UK cases were 9,055. If youâre interested in seeing how other countries have fared since easing restrictions, weâve got a feature on thathere. The UK has reported more than 50,000 daily coronavirus cases for the first time since mid-January. There were 51,870 cases recorded, the highest since 15 January, and 49 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. The milestone came just days before the easing of restrictions in England and Scotland on Monday. Wales is also making changes to its coronavirus rules as of tomorrow - all the details on what you can do in each nation can be found in our explainerhere. It comes as separate Office for National Statistics data estimates1% of people in the UKhad coronavirus last week. The more infectious Delta variant accounts for almost every case. The British Grand Prix returned today and will see thousands of Formula 1 fans descend on Silverstone over the course of the weekend. Seven-time world champion Lewis Hamilton has posted on his Instagram to urge spectators to wear masks and stay safe. ""It was so nice to see everyone today. So refreshing to see
people and the energy already is so uplifting,"" he wrote. ""Can I please ask you to wear
your masks, be safe. I know of people getting Covid and being ill even with

Follow the story from BBC Sporthere  Formula 1 fans watching the British Grand Prix at Silverstone Just a reminder about those big changes coming up after the weekend. Easing of restrictions are being made in both England and Scotland on Monday. Wales also sees changes on Saturday and Northern Ireland is set to ease rules on 26 July.

Thursday's showed there were 48,553 new cases - the highest reported since 15 January - and 63 deaths. Today's could break the 50,000 case barrier as the numbers have been rising sharply in recent weeks. And that would come just three days before England and Scotland are due to further ease coronavirus restrictions -more on that here. England's chief medical officer has warned that the UK is ""not out of the woods"" yet and people need to act with caution as the restrictions end. He warned that Covid hospitalisations were doubling every three weeks and could hit ""scary numbers"" in future. We'll bring you the latest on the figures when we have them.

Motorway shut for 12 hours as fatalities feared,"Police crash investigators have been at the scene of the crash on the A1(M) in County Durham throughout Friday Three people have died in a crash on the A1(M) which involved six vehicles, police said. Two lorries and four cars were caught up in the crash at Bowburn, County Durham, at about 18:20 BST on Thursday. Durham Police said three people from two of the cars died at the scene. A man, 41, who was driving one of the lorries has been arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving, the force said. A man who was driving a Toyota Hilux and a man and woman from a Vauxhall Crossland all died at the scene. A police spokeswoman said formal identification was expected ""to take some time"" but families had been informed. Several others were injured in the collision, with two people requiring hospital treatment, she said. The spokeswoman said: ""Due to the complexity of the scene, there is ongoing work to safely recover evidence and remove vehicles which will take some time."" Det Supt Dave Ashton said it was a ""harrowing incident"" and has been ""incredibly upsetting and distressing for those who witnessed the collision, and for the emergency responders, including police officers, firefighters and paramedics, who attended the scene"". ""Our thoughts are with the family and friends of those who have lost their loved ones,"" Mr Ashton said. He also urged members of the public not to share pictures or videos of the crash online ""out of dignity and respect for those who have lost their lives"". The Great North Air Ambulance was called to the scene, as well as police, paramedics and firefighters Mr Ashton said the road would stay shut for the rest of the day and would need to be assessed for damage before it could be opened. ""Motorists should avoid the area and plan ahead if they need to travel,"" he said.

These men are seen carrying cat boxes in Pepinster, Belgium While the main focus has been on helping those in danger, many people have also been seen rescuing their pets and other animals from the devastation. German Uwe GÃ¶decke told Deutsche Welle that he was able to flee out of his kitchen window with his wife and their dog Kuno, before being rescued by a German Red Cross motor boat. This man managed to carry his dog to safety in Ensival, Belgium But these two dogs in a house in Trooz in Belgium were still waiting to be rescued...

Activists from the Fridays for Future group in Germany have gone on strike in response to the floods in Europe. The group was set up by the climate activist Greta Thunberg. A post on Twitter announced the strike and said it was to ""fight the climate crisis"". ""Our sympathy and solidarity goes out to all of those affected by the flood
disaster,â the post said. It comes after German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier urged a more ""determined"" action on climate change, following the floods. He said it was the only way to keep that type of extreme weather within limits. This video can not be played What is climate change? German troops have been sent troops to affected areas The floods in the German state of
North-Rhine-Westphalia have been described as a ""disaster of historic
dimensions"" by the state leader. Armin Lachet told reporters that in
some parts the floods had caused ""damage of
unprecedented dimension"". A total of 23 cities and districts in the region have been affected. ""We'll repair houses, rebuild bridges,
repair traffic routes. But the lives lost in the floods are irreplaceable,"" he said. At least 42 deaths have been confirmed in North Rhine-Westphalia. But Lachet said the number was likely to rise. Much of Schuld has been reduced to debris Germans have shared their horror at the speed with which floodwaters engulfed their homes and businesses, devastating many areas near the River Rhine. Some compare the scale of devastation with the pounding that Germany endured in World War Two. And in a reminder of the war, the army is using armoured vehicles to help clear away debris. In the village of Schuld, in the Eifel region, the flash flood ripped buildings apart and tossed cars over, filling the streets with piles of debris and thick layers of mud. Towns near the old West German capital Bonn are among the worst hit Tearful 76-year-old resident Marlene Wiechmann said the last time Schuld experienced such catastrophic flooding was in 1910. It was such a shock to the community that it became part of local folklore for generations. ""Everything broken, swept away, it's a catastrophe,"" she told the public broadcaster SWR. ""Our tennis courts were over there, the house of Stanni from Poland was over there,"" she said, pointing to a tangle of mud, smashed trees and wreckage. Read our full story. If youâre just joining us, here are
the latest headlines as several European countries respond to the worst flooding in decades: Hundreds of people have been urged to
leave their homes in and around the town of Meerssen in the Netherlands after
flood waters broke through a dyke on Friday. Emergency services warned that flood
waters were approaching surrounding villages and urged people to turn off their
electricity and gas and leave their homes. An online alert told people that there was a ""large hole in the dyke"". It's thought 3,000 people have been affected, Reuters news agency reports. Hundreds of firefighters have been
deployed in Limburg province to help evacuate residents and reinforce buildings. Some houses in the worst-hit areas of the Netherlands have been completely flooded Germans are continuing to assess the damage left in the wake of the deadly flooding. The latest images from the clean-up operation show the ease by which even heavy vehicles were carried and crushed by floodwaters in the town of Bad Neuenahr-Ahrweiler. Vehicles were thrown around like toys in the town A drone shot showed a destroyed car amid muddy graves in the town The clear-up operation could take days - if not weeks The town's main bridge was destroyed by the flooding Bad Neuenahr-Ahrweiler residents have been left stunned by the sheer devastation to their town The number of people killed from the floods in Belgium has risen to 20, with at least another 20 people still missing, Interior Minister Annelies Verlinden says. Prime Minister Alexander De Croo has declared next Tuesday, 20 July, a day of national mourning. ""We're still waiting for the final toll, but this could be the most catastrophic flooding our country has ever seen,"" he said. Earlier, media reports suggested that 23 people had already been confirmed dead. Roger HarrabinBBC environment analyst Top climate scientists have admitted they failed to predictthe intensity of the German floods and the North American heat dome. They've correctly warned over decades that a fast-warming climate would bring worse bursts of rain and more damaging heatwaves. But they say their computers are not powerful enough to accurately project the severity of those extremes. They want governments to spend big on a shared climate super-computer. Computers are fundamental to weather forecasting and climate change, and computing will underpin the new climate science ""Bible"", from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) next month. But former Met Office chief scientist Prof Dame Julia Slingo told the BBC: ""We should be alarmed because the IPCC [climate computer] models are just not good enough. ""[We need] an international centre to deliver the quantum leap to climate models that capture the fundamental physics that drive extremes. ""Unless we do that we will continue to underestimate the intensity/frequency of extremes and the increasingly unprecedented nature of them."" The German military has now deployed about 850 troops to help in flood-impacted areas in the south-west of the country. A defence ministry spokesman said the number was ""rising significantly because the need is growing"". Arne Collatz said officials had triggered a ""military disaster alarm"", a move that decentralises decisions on using equipment to individual commanders on the ground. Kaan Polat was staying with family in Poulseur, Germany, when the floods hit overnight Wednesday. He told the BBC how they woke up at 04:00 yesterday to find the local river had risen in heavy rains and completely submerged their home's ground floor. My family have lived there since 1984 and they have never seen anything like that - the intensity, the speed, they were caught completely off guard.  Polat said he and neighbours tried to help each other - including by kayaking with food - as they waited for emergency service help. He was eventually rescued along with his family last night, as he told us in a phone interview today. For some people, the current was so strong only helicopters could get to them - so some people had to spend another night there, but I'm not sure what happened after.  BBC Weather It has been reported that some parts of south-west Germany recorded in excess of 150mm of rain in 24 hours, most of which fell in just a 12-hour time frame. To give an idea of how much that is, the city of Mannheim usually receives close to 70mm in an average July. The worst of the rain has now eased. However, the weather system responsible is now drifting its way southwards and
eastwards, threatening some heavy downpours and thunderstorms to other parts of
Europe. The focus on Friday will be across
parts of the Alps, southern Germany, Italy and across into the Balkans and
Poland. Similar areas will see bouts of heavy rain and thunderstorms heading
into Saturday whilst the emphasis shifts that little bit further south and east
on Sunday. With such intense rainfall, there will be the threat of some flash
flooding locally, although it is unlikely to be on the scale of the flooding we
have seen this week. This video can not be played More now from Rhineland-Palatinate, where the state leader has warned that the death toll linked to the floods is expected to rise. ""Numerous people are still considered missing,"" Malu Dreyer said. ""We
have 60 dead to mourn at the moment and it's feared that the number will
rise even further. We're not giving up hope, of
course"". She added that the heavy rain hit regions where
typical flood protection is not required. She said that developing new flood
protection concepts would be a priority. ""Yet I would like to say that these floods were so
severe that at some point there were limits to how much protection we could
actually provide,"" she said. Parts of the municipality of Schuld have been devastated One of the worst-hit areas in Germany's Rhineland-Palatinate is the municipality of Schuld, where about 700 people live. Local residents say they have been stunned by the force of the water. Frank Thel told Reuters news agency: There wasn't anything left that could be broken. Half the town is destroyed. It was terrible not to be able to help people. They were waving at us out of the windows.  Houses were collapsing to the left and right of them and in the house in between they were waving and luckily they survived.  Another local resident, who identified himself simply as Larscheid, said: The water came so fast, I've never seen anything like that. We were on the bridge down there and I thought, this might be getting tight, and then it was over, the water rose and rose continually, and I realised, it's useless now to try save anything. Car, gone, all gone, digger, gone, it was all gone.  The water had such enormous power! We were in the house, it blew the door open and I was thrown against the chimney-stove. That's how much pressure the water had when filling the house.  This video can not be played German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier has urged a more ""determined"" action on climate change, following the deadly flooding in the western states of his country. He said that was the only way to keep that type of extreme weather within limits. Steinmeier also said he was stunned by the suffering and damage caused by the floods, and warned that many people would need help long after the floodwaters had gone. ""The water is receding. The full extent of the disaster is only now becoming clear,"" the president said. ""Perhaps, in a few days' time, the terrible pictures of the flooding will not dominate the news - but that is exactly when people in the flooded areas will most need our continued support. We must not disappoint them."" Roads have been left completely destroyed by the floods in Schuld, Germany Flood damage in Schuld, Germany A mobile flood barrier has been installed in Lucern, Switzerland The Belgian city of LiÃ¨ge has also been hit by heavy flooding with the mayor telling people to leave if they can Flash floods in Germany have destroyed buildings and swept away cars Welcome to our coverage of the extreme weather disaster in Europe: Ursula von der Leyen (left) was speaking during a visit to Dublin European Commission President Ursula
von der Leyen has become the latest politician from Germany to call for urgent action to tackle global warming in the wake of the deadly flooding in western Europe. ""It is the intensity and the length of the events that
science tells us this is a clear indication of climate change
and that this is something that really, really shows the urgency
to act,"" she told reporters during a visit to Dublin, the capital of the Republic of Ireland. We reported earlier that similar appeals were made by the leaders of the two German states worst hit by the flooding(see our 10:47 post). Â© 2025 BBC.

Goldman to require staff to wear masks from MondayThe banking giant hopes 70% of UK staff will return to its London office in the coming weeks.Business,"This video can not be played Richard Gnodde is the boss of Goldman Sachs International Bankers returning on Monday to Goldman Sachs' Â£1bn London head office will be required to wear masks in the building despite the easing of government rules. However, unlike some competitors, Goldman will not require staff to be vaccinated to come into work. It hopes 70% of UK staff will return to the office in the coming weeks. The boss of Goldman Sachs International Richard Gnodde said the company remained as committed to its London head office as ever. Mr Gnodde told the BBC: ""The centre of gravity for our workforce is going to be in our buildings and it will be in this building. ""Our focus is very much on securing a safe workplace. People will still be wearing masks in the building."" He said the bank would not insist on people being vaccinated in order to come in, nor would they force people to return if they felt uncomfortable doing so: ""[We will] continue to manage our exit from this in a cautious and appropriate way to make sure that our people feel comfortable."" Goldman bankers ordered to disclose vaccine status Firms don't plan to rush back to offices on Monday Financial services is a crown jewel in the UK economy and contributes 12% of all taxes paid in the UK. Since the Brexit vote, more than Â£1tn of customer and company money, trillions more in transaction volumes and an estimated 8,000 jobs have left the capital. This has left some questioning whether that crown was in danger of slipping. On the day real royalty in the shape of Prince Charles visited Goldman's offices, Mr Gnodde told the BBC that the future for London remains bright. ""We put this building in place through the Brexit period and it really underscores our confidence that London will remain one of the world's leading financial centres,"" Mr Gnodde said. ""There has been some movement of assets. So you know, that has gone. And our access to the European market is not as free as it used to be. We have to build and create new opportunities."" Richard Gnodde said the company remained committed to its London head office But there was also a thinly disguised warning. Creating those opportunities will need the help of the government and regulators to keep London competitive with other international centres. Mr Gnodde thinks that lessons can be learnt from the big bank deregulation of financial services in 1985. ""The UK was unambiguously supportive of financial services - it was crystal clear. I really want to stress this point - certainty -  in terms of support for business is absolutely key. ""And it has to be consistent. You can't support business on Monday and Tuesday, and then criticise it on a Wednesday and Thursdayâ¦ that sends a confusing message. Certainty is critical."" When City bosses talk about competitiveness, it's often code for lighter regulation. Outside the EU, many have called for a bonfire of regulation. If Mr Gnodde had the match which bits would he burn? ""Eliminate duplication and unnecessary excessive reporting. Let's do what we have to do to have effective regulation. But let's cut out some of the bureaucratic elements to enable firms to use their capital resources efficiently."" Some traders have been working in Canary Wharf during the pandemic Doing more business with the fastest growing parts of the globe means grappling with the economic might of China. How complicated could that be when Chinese firms are being booted out of telecoms infrastructure, democracy in Hong Kong is under assault and China is facing allegations of using forced labour of the Uyghur population? ""I think this this is a multifaceted relationship,"" he answered. ""I think our relationship with China, in many ways will be as a partner. If we're going to tackle climate change, we're going to have to do this together. We live on the same planet. They will be a customer and a client of many of our businesses. And then absolutely, we should have the right appropriate conversations on the political arena in the areas where we compete."" It's a big world out there with plenty of opportunity - and while Mr Gnodde accepts the UK outside the EU is arguably a smaller fish, that's not necessarily an bad thing. ""Sometimes being a smaller fish is an advantage. Your level of paranoia goes up - you need to move to innovate, to create. Look over the last century and the issues that this country has been through and we're absolutely confident that the people of Britain will take it forward again."" Statements like that will be sure to help mend a sometime fractious relationship between the City and the government over the past few years.

Flooding kills dozens in Germany and Belgium,"This video can not be played The deadly floods have left homes and cars destroyed At least 70 people have died in Germany and Belgium after record rainfall caused rivers to burst their banks. Most of the victims were in Germany, but at least 11 have died in Belgium, with more reported missing. The German states of Rhineland-Palatinate and North Rhine-Westphalia were worst hit, but the Netherlands is also badly affected. More heavy rain is forecastacross the region on Friday, while local officials have blamed climate change. Armin Laschet, the premier of North Rhine-Westphalia, blamed the extreme weather on global warming during a visit to a hard-hit area. ""We will be faced with such events over and over, and that means we need to speed up climate protection measures... because climate change isn't confined to one state,"" he said. Experts say that climate change is expected to increase the frequency of extreme weather events, but linking any single event to global warming is complicated. PICTURES: Deadly floods hit Germany and Belgium German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is in the US ahead of a meeting with President Joe Biden, called the flooding a ""catastrophe"" and said she was ""grieving those who have lost their lives"". ""My thoughts are with you, and you can trust that all forces of our government - federal, regional and community - collectively will do everything under the most difficult conditions to save lives, alleviate dangers and to relieve distress."" Your device may not support this visualisation In Germany, police helicopters and hundreds of soldiers have been deployed to affected areas to help stranded residents. Dozens of people waited on rooftops to be rescued. Schools have been closed around the west of Germany, while transport links have been severely disrupted. About 25 houses are in danger of collapsing in the district of Schuld bei Adenau in the mountainous Eifel region, where a state of emergency has been declared, according to German broadcaster SWR. It said some houses had been completely cut-off and could no longer be reached by boat. The army has been deployed to help people in affected areas Residents in the region told AFP news agency they were stunned by the disaster. ""Nobody was expecting this - where did all this rain come from? It's crazy,"" Annemarie Mueller, a 65-year-old resident of Mayen, said. ""It made such a loud noise and given how fast it came down we thought it would break the door down."" Local teacher Ortrud Meyer, 36, said she had ""never seen anything like this"". ""My father-in-law is almost 80, he's from Mayen, and he says he's never experienced anything like this,"" she said. In Belgium, dramatic footage of the floods showed cars being swept away along a street in the city of Verviers. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Residents of LiÃ¨ge, Belgium's third-largest urban area after Brussels and Antwerp, were ordered to evacuate. Those unable to leave should move to the upper floors of their buildings, local officials said. The Meuse river which flows through the city is expected to rise by another 1.5 metres, despite being on the verge of overflowing already. Officials are also concerned that a dam bridge in the area may collapse and urged people to help each other. ""The crisis situation is exceptional and solidarity must prevail,"" the local authority said in a statement. Residents of the Belgian town of Pepinster, which lies at the confluence of two rivers in LiÃ¨ge province, were evacuated in a large truck on Thursday, but conditions in the municipality of Trooz are so bad that evacuation efforts have been halted. In the Netherlands, there have been no casualties reported but thousands of people in towns and villages along the Meuse river have been urged to leave their houses quickly. In the Dutch city of Maastricht, 10,000 people have been ordered to evacuate. And flooding in Valkenburg, close to the Belgian and German borders, engulfed the town centre and forced the evacuation of several nursing homes. Have you been affected by the flooding?

Merkel vows support after dozens killed in floods,"This video can not be played Drone footage shows flood damage in Germany and Belgium At least 120 people have died and hundreds more in western Europe are unaccounted for after some of the worst flooding in decades. Record rainfall caused rivers to burst their banks, devastating the region. In Germany, where the death toll now stands at over 100, Chancellor Angela Merkel called for a determined battle against climate change. At least 20 people have died in Belgium. The Netherlands, Luxembourg and Switzerland are also affected. Many factors contribute to flooding, but a warming atmosphere caused by climate change makes extreme rainfall more likely. The world has already warmed by about 1.2C since the industrial era began and temperatures will keep rising unless governments around the world make steep cuts to emissions. MAPS: Where are the worst-hit areas? ANALYSIS: How floods caught Germany by surprise PICTURES: Floods kill dozens in western Europe WITNESSES: 'My city looks like a battlefield' Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo declared 20 July a national day of mourning. ""We are still waiting for the final toll, but this could be the most catastrophic flooding our country has ever seen,"" he said. We met an elderly man trying to get into a village which was all but destroyed. His grandchildren were there, he said, but he couldn't get hold of their parents. Even the authorities say they don't know for sure how many people are missing. There is no phone signal in much of the region, making communication all but impossible. But the death toll is expected to rise today and with every hour that passes the magnitude of this disaster becomes ever clearer. All along the River Ahr there are flooded homes, broken bridges, the twisted remains of campsites and caravan parks. For many of the dazed people we met surveying the damage here, it's almost impossible to imagine clearing up and starting again. Some 15,000 police, soldiers and emergency service workers have been deployed in Germany to help with the search and rescue. Entire villages have been destroyed, and officials in the western German district of Ahrweiler say up to 1,300 people are unaccounted for. Gregor Jericho, a resident of Rheinbach in North Rhine-Westphalia, told the BBC: ""It's a very sad scene. Streets, bridges and some buildings are destroyed. There's garbage everywhere. ""Parts of buildings are in the road, people are sitting and crying. It's so sad. People have lost their homes, their cars are in fields flooded. My city looks like a battle has taken place."" As many as 1,300 people are still unaccounted for in the western German district of Ahrweiler In the same town, Ansgar Rehbein told Reuters he saw the river's water level rising so rapidly that he had to immediately get out of his house. ""Once the river started overflowing and the water came down from the hillside, it was a matter of two minutes before the courtyard was flooded with waist-high water,"" he told the news agency. ""We had to get out through the window and uphill in order to save ourselves."" Your device may not support this visualisation In Belgium, dramatic footage of the floods showed cars being swept away along a street in the city of Verviers. A curfew was in place overnight because of the risk of looting. Residents of LiÃ¨ge, Belgium's third-largest urban area after Brussels and Antwerp, were ordered to evacuate on Thursday. Local officials said those unable to leave should move to the upper floors of their buildings. The Meuse river, which flows through the city, stabilised on Friday morning, with small overflows in some areas. Scientists have condemned politicians for failing to protect their citizens from extreme weather events such as the floods in northern Europe and the US heat dome. They have been predicting for years that summer rainfall and heatwaves would become more intense due to human-induced climate change. Hannah Cloke, Professor of Hydrology at the University of Reading, said: ""The deaths and destruction across Europe as a result of flooding is a tragedy that should have been avoided. ""Forecasters issued alerts early in the week, and yet the warnings were not taken seriously enough and preparations were inadequate. ""The fact that other parts of the northern hemisphere are currently suffering record-breaking heatwaves and fires should serve as a reminder of just how much more dangerous our weather could become in an ever-warmer world."" Scientists say governments must both cut the CO2 emissions that are fuelling extreme events, AND prepare for more extreme weather. Yet in the UK - hit by severe flooding on Monday - the government's advisory climate change committee recently told ministers the nation was even worse prepared for extreme weather than it was five years ago. It said the government was keeping only a fifth of its pledges to cut emissions. And only this week the UK government told people that they don't need to reduce flying because technology will solve the emissions problem - a notion that most experts consider a gamble. READ MORE: Science failed to predict flood and heat intensity The Netherlands has reported no casualties but thousands of people in towns and villages along the Meuse river have been urged to leave their houses quickly. The river running through the Swiss capital Bern burst its banks, flowing at a record rate of 560 cubic metres a second on Friday. Lake Lucerne is flooding into the town and people in Basel have been told to keep well away from the River Rhine. There is also the risk of mud and rock slides in the Alps as the flood waters run off. Global heating causes more water to evaporate, which leads to an increase in the amount of annual rain and snow At the same time, a warmer atmosphere means it can hold more moisture - which also increases the intensity of rainfall Rather than gently watering plants, this intense rainfall leads to flooding, like we're seeing in Northern Europe now Have you been affected by the flooding in Germany?
