'Huge gaps' in draft coronavirus workplace rules,"Draft guidance for getting people back to work during the coronavirus pandemic could compromise worker safety, the head of the TUC has warned. Frances O'Grady, who leads the group representing UK unions, said it cannot back the advice in its ""current form"". She said there were ""huge gaps"" over protective kit and testing. Reduced hot-desking and alternatives to social distancing where it is not possible are among measures being considered by the government. The document, seen by the BBC, is one of seven draft plans to ease anti-virus restrictions. It also urges employers to minimise numbers using equipment, stagger shift times and maximise home-working. The guidance covers the whole of the UK - but the devolved governments have the power to make their own decisions on how businesses can get back to work.

Meanwhile, the number of coronavirus-related deaths in the UK stands at 28,734, an increase of 288, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said at the Downing Street briefing. The health secretary outlined the coronavirus contact-tracing app at the Downing Street briefing The daily increase in deaths is lower than at any point since the end of March, but the figures reported at the weekend tend to be lower and are expected to rise, Mr Hancock said. A total of 13,258 people are currently being treated in hospital, while 85,186 coronavirus tests took place on Sunday. However, hospital admissions have fallen, along with the number of critical care beds being used. A coronavirus contact-tracing app aimed at limiting a second wave of coronavirus willbe trialled on the Isle of Wight this week, before being rolled out more widely in the UK, as part of the government's test, track and trace effort. Mr Hancock said creating the system was a ""huge national undertaking"" and would allow the UK to take a ""more targeted approach to lockdown while still safely containing the disease"".

TESTING:Can I get tested for coronavirus? Buzzfeed has seenall seven draft documents,externalon getting people back to work. Ms O'Grady said the Trades Union Congress had seen some of the documents on Sunday. She said workers' safety must not be compromised and called for ""robust direction and enforcement"" so employers can ""do the right thing"" and action can be taken against those who do not. Frances O'Grady is general secretary of the TUC which represents many UK trade unions She told BBC Radio 4's The World at One: ""The problem is the government is asking us to trust to employer discretion, use words like 'consider social distancing', 'consider having hand sanitiser or soap available', and frankly that's just not good enough."" Asked whether the government's current advice will compromise worker safety, Ms O'Grady said No 10 has time to ""get this right"" and it should work with unions to ensure ""a proper job"" and ""not a botched job"". According to one of the seven draft documents seen by the BBC, firms are told to enact additional hygiene procedures, as well as physical screens, and protective equipment should be considered where maintaining distancing of 2m (6ft) between workers is impossible. However, the section marked personal protective equipment (PPE) contains only a promise that ""more detail"" will follow. During the Downing Street briefing, BBC health editor Hugh Pym asked where those businesses required to have PPE for their staff would source it, and whether they would be in competition with the NHS. Mr Hancock said the ""first call"" on PPE must be for NHS and social care staff, as well as those ""essential services who need it to keep the people delivering those services safe"". He reiterated PPE was one of the government's five tests for adjusting the lockdown. The BBC has also seen a second document with advice for the hospitality industry, which says bar areas, seated restaurants and cafe areas must be closed, with all food and drink outlets serving takeaway food only. It adds hotels should consider ""room occupancy levels to maintain social distancing, especially in multi-occupancy dormitories"". It also says ""guidance to follow"" on the use of PPE and face masks. Some of the other guidance featured in the document includes: Allowing access to as few people as possible into kitchens Spacing workstations 2m apart as much as possible Minimising contact between kitchen and food preparation workers and delivery drivers or riders for example by having zones from which delivery drivers can collect packaged food items Using front of house staff to serve customers in walk-in takeaways, with tills 2m away from the kitchen and ideally separated by a wall or partition Creating a physical barrier, such as a screen, between front of house workers and customers where possible Asking customers to order online, on apps or over the telephone to reduce queues and stagger pick-up times Providing handwashing and hand sanitisers and encourage visitors to wash their hands regularly Considering room occupancy levels to maintain social distancing, especially in multi-occupancy dormitories. Taking measures to avoid crowded reception areas, staggering check-in and check-out times Boris Johnson is to reveal a ""roadmap"" out of lockdown on Sunday, but in a video message on Monday he said the the UK must not lift restrictions too soon. In the video,posted on Twitter,external, Mr Johnson said: ""The worst thing we could do now is ease up too soon and allow a second peak of coronavirus."" Mr Johnson said the UK would only be able to move on to ""the second phase of this conflict"" when the government'sfive testshad been met, including a sustained and consistent fall in daily deaths and being confident any adjustments would not risk a second peak which could overwhelm the health service. Many companies have been shut since widespread limits on everyday life were imposed on 23 March, in a bid to limit the effects of the virus's spread on the NHS. Ministers are obliged to review those restrictions by Thursday. London's NHS Nightingale was built in just nine days Meanwhile, London's NHS Nightingale hospitalis expected not to admit any new patients and be placed on standby in the coming days. The ExCel Centre was turned into a 4,000-bed facility to increase the NHS's capacity for treating patients with Covid-19. In a briefing to staff, the hospital's chief executive said it was ""likely"" the hospital would not need to admit patients in the coming days while the virus remained under control in London. The BBC understands fewer than 20 people are currently being treated there.

France's first coronavirus case 'was in December',"A doctor suggests the virus arrived in France almost a month earlier than previously thought A patient treated in a hospital near Paris on 27 December for suspected pneumonia actually had the coronavirus, his doctor has said. This means the virus may have arrived in Europe almost a month earlier than previously thought. Dr Yves Cohen said a swab taken at the time was recently tested, and came back positive for Covid-19. The patient, who has since recovered, said he had no idea where he caught the virus as he had not travelled abroad. Knowing who was the first case is key to understanding how the virus spread. The World Health Organization (WHO) says it is possible more early cases will come to light, and spokesman Christian Lindmeier urged countries to check records for similar cases in order to gain a clearer picture of the outbreak. The French health ministry told the BBC that the government was obtaining confirmation on the case and that it would consider further investigations if they proved necessary. France is not the only country where subsequent testing points to earlier cases. Two weeks ago,a post-mortem examination carried out in Californiarevealed that the first coronavirus-related death in the US was almost a month earlier than previously thought. Dr Cohen, head of emergency medicine at Avicenne and Jean-Verdier hospitals near Paris, said the patient was a 43-year-old man from Bobigny, north-east of Paris. He told the BBC's Newsday programme that the patient must have been infected between 14 and 22 December, as coronavirus symptoms take between five and 14 days to appear. Listen to the interview The patient, Amirouche Hammar was admitted to hospital on 27 December exhibiting a dry cough, a fever and trouble breathing - symptoms which would later become known as main indications of coronavirus. This was four days before the WHO's China country office was informed of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause being detected in the Chinese city of Wuhan. Mr Hammartold French broadcaster BFMTV,externalthat he had not left France before falling sick. Dr Cohen said while two of the patient's children had also fallen ill, his wife had not shown any symptoms. But Dr Cohen pointed out that the patient's wife worked at a supermarket near Charles de Gaulle airport and could have come into contact with people who had recently arrived from China. The patient's wife said that ""often customers would come directly from the airport, still carrying their suitcases"". ""We're wondering whether she was asymptomatic,"" Dr Cohen said. Could coronavirus have been circulating in Europe in late 2019, many weeks before it was officially recognised and declared a threat there? That is the suggestion being made after a French doctor has revealed that he treated a patient in Paris with all of the symptoms of coronavirus just after Christmas. How does this change what we know about the pandemic? It might be that the test result is an error and so does not change a thing. But it if is correct, it could mean spread of the disease was going unchecked in Europe while all eyes were on the East in Wuhan. Certainly, any laboratories in Europe with samples from patients sick with similar symptoms around that time might want to run a test for coronavirus to see what it reveals so that we can learn more about this new disease. Until now, what were thought to have been the France's first three cases of coronavirus were confirmed on 24 January. Of those, two had been to Wuhan - where the outbreak was first detected - and the third was a close family member. Mr Hammar's positive test result suggests the virus was present in France much earlier. The first human-to-human transmission within Europe had until now thought to have been a German man who was infected by a Chinese colleague who visited Germany between 19 and 22 January. Rowland Kao, a professor of veterinary epidemiology and data science at the University of Edinburgh, said that if confirmed, Mr Hammar's case highlighted the speed at which an infection starting in a seemingly remote part of the world could quickly seed infections elsewhere. ""It means that the lead time we have for assessment and decision-making can be very short,"" Prof Kao said. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? WHAT DOES IT DO TO THE BODY?Doctors on the front line explain HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories HOW A VIRUS SPREADS:An explanation TESTING:Can I get tested for coronavirus? Dr Cohen told  the BBC that he had the idea to look back at all patients who had been in intensive care units with suspected pneumonia between 2 December and 16 January. He found 14 patients who had tested negative for pneumonia. He defrosted their samples and tested them for traces of Covid-19. This video can not be played Coronavirus vaccine: How close are you to getting one? He said that out of the 14 samples, one tested positive for traces of Covid-19. A second test on that same sample also came back positive. He added that the patient's chest scan was also compatible with the symptoms of Covid-19. A full report was due later this week, and would be published by the International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents, Dr Cohen added.

"US to borrow record $3tn in pandemic spendingThe sum is more than five times the previous quarterly record, in the 2008 financial crisis.Business","The US has said it wants to borrow a record $3tn (Â£2.4tn) in the second quarter, as coronavirus-related rescue packages blow up the budget. The sum is more than five times the previous quarterly record, set at the height of the 2008 financial crisis. In all of 2019, the country borrowed $1.28tn. The US has approved about $3tn in virus-related relief, including health funding and direct payouts. Total US government debt is now near $25tn. This video can not be played 'We used to donate to this food bank, now we rely on it' The latest spending packages are estimated to be worth about 14% of the country's economy. The government has also extended the annual 15 April deadline for tax payments, adding to the cash crunch. The new borrowing estimate is more than $3tn above the government's previous estimate, a sign of the impact of the new programmes. The Fed's four radical moves to save the economy Does the US debt of $20tn matter? Discussions are under way over further assistance, though some Republicans have expressed concerns about the impact of more spending on the country's skyrocketing national debt. The US borrows by selling government bonds. It has historically enjoyed relatively low interest rates since its debt is viewed as relatively low-risk by investors around the world. But even before the coronavirus, the country's debt load had been climbing toward levels many economists consider risky for long-term growth, as the country spent more than it took in. This video can not be played Coronavirus: When might Hollywood reopen for business? The US Congressional Budget Office last month predicted the budget deficit would hit $3.7tn this year, while the national debt soared above 100% of GDP. Last week, the chair of America's central bank, Jerome Powell, said he would have liked to see the US government's books be in better shape before the pandemic. Coronavirus: Tracking the global outbreak Wristbands, colour-coding - inventive ways out of lockdown The people spending lockdown up a 30ft tree However, he said spending now was essential to cushion the economic blow, as orders to shut businesses to slow the spread of the virus cost at least 30 million people their jobs. ""It may well be that the economy will need more help from all of us if the recovery is to be a robust one,"" he said. This video can not be played Armel Omatoko has moved his dance classes online so people can stay involved during lockdown. As part of its own relief efforts, the Federal Reserve has bought more than $1tn in treasuries in recent weeks. Investors from foreign countries are also historically significant holders of US debt, with Japan, China and the UK at the top of the pack as of February. Increased tensions between the US and China in recent years have renewed scrutiny of America's debt position. According to the Washington Post last week, Trump administration officials had discussed cancelling debt obligations to China, but US President Donald Trump reportedly played down the idea, saying ""you start playing those games and it's tough"". For now, continued low rates suggest investor appetite for US debt remains, allowing for a borrowing increase, Alan Blinder, a professor of economics and public affairs at Princeton University, told the BBC last month. ""So far, the answer has been everything is fine, as to how much borrowing the United States government can do before investors start to feel satiated with US debt,"" he said.

World leaders pledge billions for vaccine fight,"Scientists in Beijing carrying out one of dozens of research projects into potential vaccines More than $8bn (Â£6.5bn) has been pledged to help develop a coronavirus vaccine and fund research into the diagnosis and treatment of the disease. Some 40 countries and donors took part in an online summit hosted by the EU. EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the money would help kickstart unprecedented global co-operation. She said it showed the true value of unity and humanity, but warned much more would be needed in the days ahead. In total, more than 30 countries, along with UN and philanthropic bodies and research institutes, made donations. Donors also included pop singer Madonna, who pledged â¬1m ($1.1m), said Ms von der Leyen, who set outthe Brussels-led initiative,externalon Friday. The European Commission pledged $1bn to fund research on a vaccine.  Norway matched the European Commission's contribution, and France has pledged â¬500m, as have Saudi Arabia and Germany.  Japan pledged more than $800m. The US and Russia did not take part.  China, where the virus originated in December, was represented by its ambassador to the European Union. Of the money raised, $4.4bn will go on vaccine development, some $2bn on the search for a treatment and $1.6bn for producing tests, the EU said. In her opening remarks at the summit, Ms von der Leyen said everyone must chip in to finance ""a truly global endeavour"". ""I believe 4 May will mark a turning point in our fight against coronavirus because today the world is coming together,"" she said. ""The partners are many, the goal is one: to defeat this virus."" UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, another co-host of the conference, said the ""more we pull together"" in sharing expertise, ""the faster our scientists will succeed"" in developing a vaccine. Mr Johnson, who spent three nights in intensive care with Covid-19, was to confirm the UK's pledge of Â£388m for vaccine research, testing and treatment during the conference. Along with the European Commission, the conference is being co-hosted by the UK, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Norway and Saudi Arabia. Emmanuel Macron and Angela Merkel, pictured last year, are among the world leaders who signed the letter Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel are also among those who have signed up to the initiative. In the open letter published in weekend newspapers, the leaders said the funds raised would ""kickstart an unprecedented global co-operation between scientists and regulators, industry and governments, international organisations, foundations and healthcare professionals"". ""If we can develop a vaccine that is produced by the world, for the whole world, this will be a unique global public good of the 21st Century,"" they added. At the same time, the signatories gave their backing to the World Health Organization in the face of US criticism of its handling of the outbreak. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself?

With more than one million cases, the US has the highest number of confirmed infections in the world. The country has also recorded more than 68,000 deaths - and on MondayPresident Trump warned that the death toll may reach 100,000. New York State remains the epicentre, as shown in the chart below.

Cagil KasapogluBBC News, Turkish Turkey's coronavirus containment restrictions will be eased by mid-May, including reopening of shopping centres, hair saloons and some stores, President Tayyip Erdogan said on Monday. Turkey has been imposing blanket curfews over the last few weekends in 31 cities. Over-65s will be allowed to go out ""only within walking distance"" for a few hours a day from 10 May. Similar rules will apply to children. Erdogan said shopping malls, barber shops and some stores will be allowed to reopen on 11 May. Universities will return on 15 June. But Erdogan warned that much stricter measures would be put in place if the public does not abide by the rules. âThis normalisation plan does not mean weâll be back to our days as of the first days of March,â he said. According to Turkeyâs Ministry of Health, the death toll in the country has risen to 3,461. The National Rifle Association (NRA) - the largest pro-gun lobbying group in the US - has furloughed workers (given them temporary leave) and cut salaries due to the coronavirus pandemic. The group's annual convention - which probably would have drawn a visit from President Trump - has also been cancelled. ""The cancellation of the annual meeting had a significant financial impact but, beyond that, the health crisis has caused us to postpone countless fundraising and membership events,"" said NRA spokesman Andrew Arulanandam. The virus has caused a record spike in US gun sales, according to the FBI. How the coronavirus led to the highest-ever spike in US gun sales The number of people who have died with coronavirus around the world has passed a quarter of a million - rising to 250,134, according to figures published by Johns Hopkins University. A music shop prepares to open in Colorado At least six more US states are loosening social distancing measures starting on Monday. Gyms in Arkansas can resume operation, as long as clients have their temperatures screened before entering. Florida beaches and parks can reopen, but not in the Miami area. Missouri businesses can open, but customers must keep six feet (two metres) apart. Nonessential businesses in Colorado are also permitted to reopen, but with limited capacity. Ohioâs governor is allowing manufacturing, construction and office work to resume starting on Monday. Retail shops are expected to reopen on 12 May. Indiana is moving towards its second stage of reopening and is allowing social gatherings of up to 25 people. But residents over 65 are encouraged to remain at home. Around half of US states have begun taking steps to reopen, even as health officials warn that the pandemic is not yet under control. The number of unemployed Austrians reached a record high in April, the country's news agency ANA reports. Figures showed 571,477 people, or 12.8% of the population, were unemployed - up more than 210,000 from the same time last year. Austria, which has 15,621 coronavirus cases and 600 deaths according to Johns Hopkins University, began relaxing its restrictions and allowing some shops to reopen in mid-April. Football matches in the UK are likely to be played behind closed doors for an extended period because of bans on mass gatherings amid the coronavirus pandemic. FA chairman Greg Clarke has saidit is hard to see fans returning ""any time soon"" and the Premier League is preparing for the possibility of playing next season without fans. So what would be the impact of a season without fans on the Premier League clubs? BBC Sport and football finance lecturer Kieran Maguire has taken a look. Research suggests Arsenal generated nearly a quarter of their total income from matchday last season, making them vulnerable financially. Read more here Players in the top two flights of football in Spain will return to training this week with the hope of the leagues restarting in June. They will initially train alone but a ""staggered return to training"" will be implemented with players training together at a later date. Football in Spain was suspended indefinitely in March because of the coronavirus pandemic. In the UK, the Premier League hopes to resume on 8 June but there isdisagreement between the clubs on how to move forward. In Germany, clubs have been training in groups before a planned return to training as teams. The German league could restart on 16 or 23 May. It has already been announced that the top leagues in France and the Netherlands will not resume. UK officials said on Monday it was ""perfectly reasonable"" to look at how guidance about the next
stage of coronavirus restrictions could apply to different age groups. The prime ministerâs spokesman pointed to the fact that over-70s had already been
advised to take particular care and minimise contact with others outside their
households, due to the fact they were classed as a clinically vulnerable group. He
said: âAs we go forward itâs perfectly reasonable we look at how the guidance
will apply for different age bands and we will continue to be guided by the
science.â People over 70 are more likely to have serious symptoms of the virus, but they are not automatically in the ""extremely vulnerable"" group of people who have been asked to ""shield"". Over the weekend, several public figures, including actor Michael Palin, called on the government to ensure older people were not unfairly separated from society as lockdown was lifted. Prime Minister Edouard Philippe spoke about religious services at a news conference on Monday France could allow religious services to resume earlier than planned if the easing of the lockdown this month does not result in an increase in the infection rate of coronavirus. France is set to ease its lockdown on 11 May but it had been indicated that religious ceremonies would still be banned until at least 2 June. The Christian holy day of Pentecost, celebrated 50 days after Easter Sunday, falls on 1 June. Nick Thorpe, BBC News Exams at Szerb Antal secondary school in Budapest In Hungary 84,000 pupils were back in classrooms on Monday to
sit their high school exams, despite the country's lockdown. Most appeared relieved that the
exams were not postponed,
but teachersâ unions and parents voiced concerns that pupils and staff might
spread coronavirus. Written exams have been condensed into two weeks, and no oral
exams will be held. The mood was festive outside the Bela
Bartok music gymnasium in central Budapest. Pupils who hadnât seen
each other for six weeks gathered in their best clothes, bumping elbows or
knuckles in greeting, but there was no hugging or kissing. They filed into classrooms one by one, and about half wore face
masks. At some schools police patrolled to enforce social distancing, but
not here. Inside, seven students sat in each classroom. Masks were not
compulsory during the exam, although supervisors kept theirs on. The main teachersâ union was not consulted by the government, and opposed
the decision to go ahead with the exams. With 3,000 known coronavirus infections and 350 deaths, the peak
has still not been reached in Hungary. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said in his Monday briefing that current data showed that no region of the state - which remains the epicentre of the pandemic in the US - is yet ready to reopen. There were 226 deaths in New York state on Sunday, down from 280 in the previous 24-hour period. But Cuomo said that new cases and deaths were not dropping as quickly as they first rose in the earliest days of the outbreak. ""Unfortunately we were hoping a quick up, plateau and a fast decline,"" Cuomo said. ""The decline is not as steep as the incline."" A British headteacher says he has spent Â£2,000 of his own money buying food for vulnerable families who are waiting to receive an alternative to free school meal vouchers. Lloyd Mason-Edwards, from Bradford in Yorkshire, said only about half the families eligible at his school had received them. The UK government has in England been converting free school meals for poorer children into supermarket vouchers since closing schools in March. He said the system was a ""shambles"" and was failing those in need. Read more. David ShukmanScience editor, BBC News Every time people cough, sneeze, talk or even breathe they
can spread droplets containing the virus. Thatâs the rather graphic conclusion of the Royal Society,
Britainâs oldest and most prestigious scientific academy. It highlights the risk of the virus being spread by people
who donât realise they have it - either because theyâve yet to develop symptoms
or because they never show symptoms at all. This is how an estimated 40-80% of coronavirus infections
happen and thatâs why the panel recommends face masks. The report stresses that high-quality masks should be
reserved for medical and care workers. But it says homemade face coverings can be effective, not at
protecting the wearer but at preventing the wearer from infecting others where
social distancing isnât possible, on public transport and in shops and
workplaces. The issue has become highly divisive. Some researchers say the Royal Societyâs report has ignored the risk to the public, for example, of contaminating themselves when handling masks. The UK government is still considering the evidence. It's hay fever season in some parts of the world, and the symptoms can be similar to those of coronavirus - so the UK's Royal College of General Practitioners is warning people not to
mix them up. It says it's concerned people may go outside thinking
they've just got the seasonal illness, when actually they have contracted the virus and should stay at home. Our health
correspondent Laura Foster explains how to tell the difference. This video can not be played Hay fever or coronavirus: The symptoms compared Philippa RoxbyHealth reporter, BBC News Whether people who are infected by the virus could catch it
for a second time is a question no-one yet knows the answer to. The key is whether antibodies build up in the bloodstream
when the body fights off this coronavirus, and how long they last afterwards to
protect people from further infections. Early research suggests good news. Most people do appear to develop
antibodies but how long they stick around for is still a mystery. Regularly following up people whoâve tested positive for a
number of years is the only way to find out how long immunity might last. The UK's health secretary himself is participating in a study
after contracting the virus several weeks ago. Are the antibodies still present? Are they at the same
level? Only time will tellâ¦ Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor We are, declared the prime minister at the end of last week, past the peak of the coronavirus pandemic in the UK. But he said we'd have to wait until this week to learn more about how we'll start to move out of the lockdown that has changed the country so dramatically in the past six weeks. Given that the crisis has affected pretty much everyone in one way or another, there is a fevered guessing game well under way about what moving out of the lockdown might look like - and it involves huge dilemmas for the government. With another six days to go before the prime minister is expected to spell out those choices, some things are clear. First and foremost, the government is not about to throw the country's doors open. Read more here on what easing lockdown could look like from our political editor Laura Kuenssberg. A view of the Finnish parliament in Helsinki Finland is going to allow restaurants, public services including libraries and sports facilities to reopen on 1 June. A ban on public meetings will also be eased from a maximum of 10 people to 50 people on the same day, the government said on Monday. Fewer Americans are remaining at home each day,according to a new study of mobile phone tracking data,externalfrom the University of Maryland. The anonymous location tracking data indicate a growing level of ""social distancing fatigue"", say the researchers at the Maryland Institute of Transportation. The researchers created a software code that creates a score for each state, called the Social Distancing Index, to determine how many residents are travelling away from their homes. Across the nation scores are dropping, indicating that gradually more and more Americans are venturing into public. Washington DC, where the rate of new cases is still growing, has the best social distancing score. Wyoming has the worst. Â© 2025 BBC.

World leaders pledge billions for vaccine fightMore than $8bn (Â£6.5bn) are pledged to help develop a vaccine and fund research into treatments.EuropeComments,"Scientists in Beijing carrying out one of dozens of research projects into potential vaccines More than $8bn (Â£6.5bn) has been pledged to help develop a coronavirus vaccine and fund research into the diagnosis and treatment of the disease. Some 40 countries and donors took part in an online summit hosted by the EU. EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the money would help kickstart unprecedented global co-operation. She said it showed the true value of unity and humanity, but warned much more would be needed in the days ahead. In total, more than 30 countries, along with UN and philanthropic bodies and research institutes, made donations. Donors also included pop singer Madonna, who pledged â¬1m ($1.1m), said Ms von der Leyen, who set outthe Brussels-led initiative,externalon Friday. The European Commission pledged $1bn to fund research on a vaccine.  Norway matched the European Commission's contribution, and France has pledged â¬500m, as have Saudi Arabia and Germany.  Japan pledged more than $800m. The US and Russia did not take part.  China, where the virus originated in December, was represented by its ambassador to the European Union. Of the money raised, $4.4bn will go on vaccine development, some $2bn on the search for a treatment and $1.6bn for producing tests, the EU said. In her opening remarks at the summit, Ms von der Leyen said everyone must chip in to finance ""a truly global endeavour"". ""I believe 4 May will mark a turning point in our fight against coronavirus because today the world is coming together,"" she said. ""The partners are many, the goal is one: to defeat this virus."" UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, another co-host of the conference, said the ""more we pull together"" in sharing expertise, ""the faster our scientists will succeed"" in developing a vaccine. Mr Johnson, who spent three nights in intensive care with Covid-19, was to confirm the UK's pledge of Â£388m for vaccine research, testing and treatment during the conference. Along with the European Commission, the conference is being co-hosted by the UK, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Norway and Saudi Arabia. Emmanuel Macron and Angela Merkel, pictured last year, are among the world leaders who signed the letter Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel are also among those who have signed up to the initiative. In the open letter published in weekend newspapers, the leaders said the funds raised would ""kickstart an unprecedented global co-operation between scientists and regulators, industry and governments, international organisations, foundations and healthcare professionals"". ""If we can develop a vaccine that is produced by the world, for the whole world, this will be a unique global public good of the 21st Century,"" they added. At the same time, the signatories gave their backing to the World Health Organization in the face of US criticism of its handling of the outbreak. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself?

The UN says a return to normal life will only be possible with a vaccine. Dozens of research projects trying to find a vaccine are currently under way across the world. Even with more financial commitment, it will take time to know which ones might work and how well.

What is UK's new contact tracing app?,"Self-isolation rules are changing in some parts of the UK for fully vaccinated adults and children under 18. If they are identified as a close contact of someone who's tested positive for Covid, they may soon be able to take a PCR test rather than self-isolate for 10 days. You mustself-isolate for 10 daysif you: test positive for Covid-19 live with someone who tests positive are approached by text, email or phone by contact tracers who identify you as a close contact of someone who has tested positive arrive in the UK from ared list country,external arrive in the UK from France arrive from any otheramber list country,externaland you are 18 or over, and have not been vaccinated You must also self-isolate if you or someone you live with hasCovid symptoms. You can stop self-isolating if the person with symptoms gets a negative PCR result. Each UK nation has its own contact-tracing service: England -NHS Test and Trace,external Scotland -Test and Protect,external Wales -Test, Trace, Protect,external Northern Ireland -Contact tracing service,external When peopletest positive,externalfor coronavirus, they are asked to provide details of their close contacts. These include: people they've spent at least 15 minutes with, at a distance of less than 2m (6ft) sexual partners, people they live with or have had face-to-face conversations with, at a distance of less than 1m (3ft) If you are deemed a close contact, other people in your household don't have to self-isolate unless you or they develop symptoms. Scotland From 9 August, fully vaccinated adults identified as close contacts of someone who tested positive for Covid will no longer have to self-isolate for 10 days. Instead, if they have no symptoms and at least two weeks have passed since the second dose, they can get a PCR test. If the result is negative, self-isolation can then be ended. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced a similar change - with a negative PCR result - for people aged 17 or under. Children under the age of five will be encouraged, but not required, to take a PCR test. England From 16 August,external, fully vaccinated adults and all under-18s contacted by NHS Test and Trace (not the app) will be advisedto take one PCR testas soon as possible. As long as that is negative, and they don't develop symptoms, they won't need to take further action. Wales Similar changes will happen in Walesfrom 7 August,external. However, people will be also advised to take PCR test on day two and day eight, whether they are fully vaccinated or not. Northern Ireland Ministers in Northern Ireland are expectedto discuss changes on 12 August. Any adult not fully vaccinated will still need to isolate if they are identified as contacts. Anyone who tests positive - regardless of age, vaccination status, or whether or not they have symptoms - will also still need to self-isolate. TheNHS Covid app,externalis available to download in England and Wales. If you have the app, and you spend enough time close to another person using it, you will receive a ""ping"" alert if they later test positive for Covid. You need to be within 2m (6ft) of them for 15 minutes to trigger the alert. Northern IrelandandScotlandhave separate apps. If you are ""pinged"" you're advised - but not legally obliged -to self-isolate for 10 days. Government ministers have said it is ""crucial""  that people self-isolate when sent an alert. However, it's feared that the large number of people being alerted has led tomany users deleting the app. Currently, when someone tested positive but had no symptoms, the NHS Covid app went back five days before the test, and alerted any close contacts during that time. However, the app will soon only alert close contactsfrom the previous two days before the positive test. The sensitivity of the app itself has not changed, and anyone testing positive will still have to self-isolate. In the week to 28 July, nearly 396,000 people in England and Wales received alerts from the app, a sharp drop from 690,000 the week before. In England, employers providing critical services can now request an exemption for named employees who are fully vaccinated.Sectors include energy and emergency services,external. Supermarket depot workers and food manufacturers are among those exempt from quarantine rules whatever their vaccination status. A similar system is being launched in Scotland. AÂ£500 grant is available,externalin England to people on low incomes who have to self-isolate. This includes parents who can't work because their child has to self-isolate. However, manyapplications have been turned down. In Scotland people can apply for theSelf-Isolation Support Grant,external, worth Â£500, and there isa similar scheme in Wales,external. In Northern Irelanda discretionary payment is available.,external You may also be entitled toStatutory Sick Pay,external, which is worth Â£96.35 a week, or more if your employer has a sick pay scheme.

App stores approve UK contact-tracing app for test,"A test version of the NHS's coronavirus contact-tracing app has been published to Apple and Google's app stores. Council staff and healthcare workers on the Isle of Wight will be invited to install it on Tuesday, ahead of a wider roll-out on the island on Thursday. Project chiefs have said their so-called ""centralised"" approach gives them advantages over a rival scheme advocated by the US tech giants and some privacy experts. But fresh concerns have been raised. The Information Commissioner's Office has declared that ""as a general rule, a decentralised approach"" would better follow its principle that organisations should minimise the amount of personal data they collect. The House of Commons' Human Rights Select Committee also discussed fears about plans to extend the app to record location data. ""There is an inherent risk that if you create a system that can be added to incrementally, you could do so in a way that is very privacy invasive,"" cautioned law professor Orla Lynskey. This video can not be played Matt Hancock said Isle of Wight residents using the app ""will be saving lives"" But NHSX - the health service's digital innovation unit - has stressed that: use of the app will be voluntary the only personal data stored by the app at the start will be the first part of the user's postcode additional location data will only be recorded if users agree to a further opt-in request ""Please download the app to protect the NHS and save lives,"" Health Secretary Matt Hancock urged Isle of Wight residents. ""By downloading the app, you're protecting your own health, you're protecting the health of your loved ones, and the health of the community."" The NHS Covid-19 app is intended to supplement medical tests and contact-tracing interviews carried out by humans, in order to prevent a resurgence of Covid-19 when lockdown measures are eased. This video can not be played WATCH: What is contact tracing and how does it work? It works by using Bluetooth signals to detect when two people's smartphones are close to each other. If one person later registers themselves as being infected, an alert can be sent to others judged to be at high risk of contagion. This might be based on the fact they were exposed to the same person for a long period of time or that there had been multiple instances of them being in the vicinity of different people. The trial on the Isle of Wight will help NHSX test how well the system works in practice, as well as judge how willing a population is to install and use the software. It follows a smaller experiment on an RAF base. Although the app is live, it is effectively hidden on the iOS and Android marketplaces, and residents will need to follow a set of instructions to install it. Users will be asked to enter the first part of their postcode but not their name or other personal details While in theory there is nothing to prevent the details being shared and used by others elsewhere, NHSX hopes this will not happen as it could confuse the feedback it receives. Ahead of the trial, NHSX chief Matthew Gould acknowledged that there would ""inevitably be unintended consequences"" and that ""if we think there is a better way of doing what we need to do, we won't hesitate to change"". But he added that if citizens ""want to carry on saving lives, protecting the NHS and get the country back on its feet, then downloading the app is one way they can do that"". NHSX's app will send back details of the logged Bluetooth ""handshakes"" to a UK-based computer server to do the contact matching, rather carrying out the process on the handsets themselves. Apple, Google and hundreds of privacy advocates have raised concerns that this risks hackers or even the state itself being able to re-identify anonymised users, and thus learn details about their social circles. But NHSX has consulted ethicists andGCHQ's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC),externalon the matter, and believes safeguards are in place to minimise the risk of this happening. Furthermore, it believes any such concerns are outweighed by the benefits of adopting a centralised approach. It says a centralised app will let it: spot geographical hotspots where the disease is spreading work out how to optimise the app's algorithms to make its risk-model as accurate as possible, which in turn should help it decide who needs to be told to self-isolate or request a test gain fresh insights into how the virus spreads, such as the degree to which transmission becomes less likely the more time passes since first symptoms NHSX believes another major benefit is that its app can make use of people self-diagnosing themselves before they obtain test results. The app will allow people to self-diagnose themselves by answering a series of questions This would only be possible, Mr Gould explained, because NHSX could spot ""anomalous patterns of activity"" indicating that people were lying to the app for malicious reasons. But the DP3T group - which promotes the decentralised approach - believes this claim is misleading. ""I have not seen any evidence that this would do anything but spot very large-scale and quite clumsy attacks,"" explained Prof Michael Veale. ""The only way to make sure that people can be held to account for submitting false reports is to identify them [which takes you down] a slippery slope."" What is the UK's new contact tracing plan? NHS rejects Apple-Google coronavirus app plan Apple and Google accelerate coronavirus contact tracing apps plan Another criticism of NHSX's approach is that it puts the UK at odds with Ireland, Germany, Switzerland and a growing list of other nations, which are pursuing decentralised apps. The fear is that UK citizens may face tougher restrictions on international travel if its system is not interoperable with others. Mr Gould said that NHSX was ""talking to a range of countries [to] make sure that systems can talk to each other,"" adding that France and Japan were among others developing centralised apps. But Prof Veale warned that any attempt to try to join up the two systems risked ""the worst of both worlds"". ""I don't think it's just a mater of political will. It would be a matter of sacrificing the privacy-by-design within both systems."" A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise WILL I GET PAID IF I CAN'T WORK?Rules on sick pay, wages and time off PUBLIC TRANSPORT:Is it safe to travel? TESTING:Can I get tested for coronavirus? The Isle of Wight's Green Party - which has nine locally-elected councillors - has also expressed its doubts. ""The Isle of Wight has a significantly older and more vulnerable population [and] the island's one hospital could be overwhelmed if... people feel they do no need to stick to lockdown measures due to the rolling out of this app,"" it said. But the government's coordinator for testing said the island was ""well-equipped"" to cope. ""It's quite a large population and there is a benefit in the fact that travel on and off the island is relatively restricted - the ferries are there, but they're running relatively infrequently,"" added Public Health England's Prof John Newton.

Government pays nearly quarter of worker wages,"The government is now paying the wages for nearly a quarter of UK jobs under a programme aimed at helping people put on leave due to the virus pandemic. About 2.5 million people registered last week for the scheme, bringing the total claims to 6.3 million - 23% of the employed workforce.

"'Huge gaps' in draft coronavirus workplace rulesThe leader of the TUC says she cannot recommend the government's draft advice ""in its current form"".","Draft guidance for getting people back to work during the coronavirus pandemic could compromise worker safety, the head of the TUC has warned. Frances O'Grady, who leads the group representing UK unions, said it cannot back the advice in its ""current form"". She said there were ""huge gaps"" over protective kit and testing. Reduced hot-desking and alternatives to social distancing where it is not possible are among measures being considered by the government. The document, seen by the BBC, is one of seven draft plans to ease anti-virus restrictions. It also urges employers to minimise numbers using equipment, stagger shift times and maximise home-working. The guidance covers the whole of the UK - but the devolved governments have the power to make their own decisions on how businesses can get back to work. LIVE: Latest updates from around the world How many confirmed cases are there in your area? Wristbands, colour-coding - inventive ways out of lockdown What is the UK's new contact tracing plan? Meanwhile, the number of coronavirus-related deaths in the UK stands at 28,734, an increase of 288, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said at the Downing Street briefing. The health secretary outlined the coronavirus contact-tracing app at the Downing Street briefing The daily increase in deaths is lower than at any point since the end of March, but the figures reported at the weekend tend to be lower and are expected to rise, Mr Hancock said. A total of 13,258 people are currently being treated in hospital, while 85,186 coronavirus tests took place on Sunday. However, hospital admissions have fallen, along with the number of critical care beds being used. A coronavirus contact-tracing app aimed at limiting a second wave of coronavirus willbe trialled on the Isle of Wight this week, before being rolled out more widely in the UK, as part of the government's test, track and trace effort. Mr Hancock said creating the system was a ""huge national undertaking"" and would allow the UK to take a ""more targeted approach to lockdown while still safely containing the disease"". A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise WILL I GET PAID IF I CAN'T WORK?Rules on sick pay, wages and time off PUBLIC TRANSPORT:Is it safe to travel? TESTING:Can I get tested for coronavirus? Buzzfeed has seenall seven draft documents,externalon getting people back to work. Ms O'Grady said the Trades Union Congress had seen some of the documents on Sunday. She said workers' safety must not be compromised and called for ""robust direction and enforcement"" so employers can ""do the right thing"" and action can be taken against those who do not. Frances O'Grady is general secretary of the TUC which represents many UK trade unions She told BBC Radio 4's The World at One: ""The problem is the government is asking us to trust to employer discretion, use words like 'consider social distancing', 'consider having hand sanitiser or soap available', and frankly that's just not good enough."" Asked whether the government's current advice will compromise worker safety, Ms O'Grady said No 10 has time to ""get this right"" and it should work with unions to ensure ""a proper job"" and ""not a botched job"". According to one of the seven draft documents seen by the BBC, firms are told to enact additional hygiene procedures, as well as physical screens, and protective equipment should be considered where maintaining distancing of 2m (6ft) between workers is impossible. However, the section marked personal protective equipment (PPE) contains only a promise that ""more detail"" will follow. During the Downing Street briefing, BBC health editor Hugh Pym asked where those businesses required to have PPE for their staff would source it, and whether they would be in competition with the NHS. Mr Hancock said the ""first call"" on PPE must be for NHS and social care staff, as well as those ""essential services who need it to keep the people delivering those services safe"". He reiterated PPE was one of the government's five tests for adjusting the lockdown. The BBC has also seen a second document with advice for the hospitality industry, which says bar areas, seated restaurants and cafe areas must be closed, with all food and drink outlets serving takeaway food only. It adds hotels should consider ""room occupancy levels to maintain social distancing, especially in multi-occupancy dormitories"". It also says ""guidance to follow"" on the use of PPE and face masks. Some of the other guidance featured in the document includes: Allowing access to as few people as possible into kitchens Spacing workstations 2m apart as much as possible Minimising contact between kitchen and food preparation workers and delivery drivers or riders for example by having zones from which delivery drivers can collect packaged food items Using front of house staff to serve customers in walk-in takeaways, with tills 2m away from the kitchen and ideally separated by a wall or partition Creating a physical barrier, such as a screen, between front of house workers and customers where possible Asking customers to order online, on apps or over the telephone to reduce queues and stagger pick-up times Providing handwashing and hand sanitisers and encourage visitors to wash their hands regularly Considering room occupancy levels to maintain social distancing, especially in multi-occupancy dormitories. Taking measures to avoid crowded reception areas, staggering check-in and check-out times Boris Johnson is to reveal a ""roadmap"" out of lockdown on Sunday, but in a video message on Monday he said the the UK must not lift restrictions too soon. In the video,posted on Twitter,external, Mr Johnson said: ""The worst thing we could do now is ease up too soon and allow a second peak of coronavirus."" Mr Johnson said the UK would only be able to move on to ""the second phase of this conflict"" when the government'sfive testshad been met, including a sustained and consistent fall in daily deaths and being confident any adjustments would not risk a second peak which could overwhelm the health service. Many companies have been shut since widespread limits on everyday life were imposed on 23 March, in a bid to limit the effects of the virus's spread on the NHS. Ministers are obliged to review those restrictions by Thursday. London's NHS Nightingale was built in just nine days Meanwhile, London's NHS Nightingale hospitalis expected not to admit any new patients and be placed on standby in the coming days. The ExCel Centre was turned into a 4,000-bed facility to increase the NHS's capacity for treating patients with Covid-19. In a briefing to staff, the hospital's chief executive said it was ""likely"" the hospital would not need to admit patients in the coming days while the virus remained under control in London. The BBC understands fewer than 20 people are currently being treated there.

With more than one million cases, the US has the highest number of confirmed infections in the world. The country has also recorded more than 68,000 deaths - and on MondayPresident Trump warned that the death toll may reach 100,000. New York State remains the epicentre, as shown in the chart below. View that and more charts tracking the global pandemic in thelatest guide from BBC News' Visual and Data Journalism Team. Cagil KasapogluBBC News, Turkish Turkey's coronavirus containment restrictions will be eased by mid-May, including reopening of shopping centres, hair saloons and some stores, President Tayyip Erdogan said on Monday. Turkey has been imposing blanket curfews over the last few weekends in 31 cities. Over-65s will be allowed to go out ""only within walking distance"" for a few hours a day from 10 May. Similar rules will apply to children. Erdogan said shopping malls, barber shops and some stores will be allowed to reopen on 11 May. Universities will return on 15 June. But Erdogan warned that much stricter measures would be put in place if the public does not abide by the rules. âThis normalisation plan does not mean weâll be back to our days as of the first days of March,â he said. According to Turkeyâs Ministry of Health, the death toll in the country has risen to 3,461. The National Rifle Association (NRA) - the largest pro-gun lobbying group in the US - has furloughed workers (given them temporary leave) and cut salaries due to the coronavirus pandemic. The group's annual convention - which probably would have drawn a visit from President Trump - has also been cancelled. ""The cancellation of the annual meeting had a significant financial impact but, beyond that, the health crisis has caused us to postpone countless fundraising and membership events,"" said NRA spokesman Andrew Arulanandam. The virus has caused a record spike in US gun sales, according to the FBI. How the coronavirus led to the highest-ever spike in US gun sales The number of people who have died with coronavirus around the world has passed a quarter of a million - rising to 250,134, according to figures published by Johns Hopkins University. A music shop prepares to open in Colorado At least six more US states are loosening social distancing measures starting on Monday. Gyms in Arkansas can resume operation, as long as clients have their temperatures screened before entering. Florida beaches and parks can reopen, but not in the Miami area. Missouri businesses can open, but customers must keep six feet (two metres) apart. Nonessential businesses in Colorado are also permitted to reopen, but with limited capacity. Ohioâs governor is allowing manufacturing, construction and office work to resume starting on Monday. Retail shops are expected to reopen on 12 May. Indiana is moving towards its second stage of reopening and is allowing social gatherings of up to 25 people. But residents over 65 are encouraged to remain at home. Around half of US states have begun taking steps to reopen, even as health officials warn that the pandemic is not yet under control. The number of unemployed Austrians reached a record high in April, the country's news agency ANA reports. Figures showed 571,477 people, or 12.8% of the population, were unemployed - up more than 210,000 from the same time last year. Austria, which has 15,621 coronavirus cases and 600 deaths according to Johns Hopkins University, began relaxing its restrictions and allowing some shops to reopen in mid-April. Football matches in the UK are likely to be played behind closed doors for an extended period because of bans on mass gatherings amid the coronavirus pandemic. FA chairman Greg Clarke has saidit is hard to see fans returning ""any time soon"" and the Premier League is preparing for the possibility of playing next season without fans. So what would be the impact of a season without fans on the Premier League clubs? BBC Sport and football finance lecturer Kieran Maguire has taken a look. Research suggests Arsenal generated nearly a quarter of their total income from matchday last season, making them vulnerable financially. Read more here Players in the top two flights of football in Spain will return to training this week with the hope of the leagues restarting in June. They will initially train alone but a ""staggered return to training"" will be implemented with players training together at a later date. Football in Spain was suspended indefinitely in March because of the coronavirus pandemic. In the UK, the Premier League hopes to resume on 8 June but there isdisagreement between the clubs on how to move forward. In Germany, clubs have been training in groups before a planned return to training as teams. The German league could restart on 16 or 23 May. It has already been announced that the top leagues in France and the Netherlands will not resume. UK officials said on Monday it was ""perfectly reasonable"" to look at how guidance about the next
stage of coronavirus restrictions could apply to different age groups. The prime ministerâs spokesman pointed to the fact that over-70s had already been
advised to take particular care and minimise contact with others outside their
households, due to the fact they were classed as a clinically vulnerable group. He
said: âAs we go forward itâs perfectly reasonable we look at how the guidance
will apply for different age bands and we will continue to be guided by the
science.â People over 70 are more likely to have serious symptoms of the virus, but they are not automatically in the ""extremely vulnerable"" group of people who have been asked to ""shield"". Over the weekend, several public figures, including actor Michael Palin, called on the government to ensure older people were not unfairly separated from society as lockdown was lifted. Prime Minister Edouard Philippe spoke about religious services at a news conference on Monday France could allow religious services to resume earlier than planned if the easing of the lockdown this month does not result in an increase in the infection rate of coronavirus. France is set to ease its lockdown on 11 May but it had been indicated that religious ceremonies would still be banned until at least 2 June. The Christian holy day of Pentecost, celebrated 50 days after Easter Sunday, falls on 1 June. Nick Thorpe, BBC News Exams at Szerb Antal secondary school in Budapest In Hungary 84,000 pupils were back in classrooms on Monday to
sit their high school exams, despite the country's lockdown. Most appeared relieved that the
exams were not postponed,
but teachersâ unions and parents voiced concerns that pupils and staff might
spread coronavirus. Written exams have been condensed into two weeks, and no oral
exams will be held. The mood was festive outside the Bela
Bartok music gymnasium in central Budapest. Pupils who hadnât seen
each other for six weeks gathered in their best clothes, bumping elbows or
knuckles in greeting, but there was no hugging or kissing. They filed into classrooms one by one, and about half wore face
masks. At some schools police patrolled to enforce social distancing, but
not here. Inside, seven students sat in each classroom. Masks were not
compulsory during the exam, although supervisors kept theirs on. The main teachersâ union was not consulted by the government, and opposed
the decision to go ahead with the exams. With 3,000 known coronavirus infections and 350 deaths, the peak
has still not been reached in Hungary. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said in his Monday briefing that current data showed that no region of the state - which remains the epicentre of the pandemic in the US - is yet ready to reopen. There were 226 deaths in New York state on Sunday, down from 280 in the previous 24-hour period. But Cuomo said that new cases and deaths were not dropping as quickly as they first rose in the earliest days of the outbreak. ""Unfortunately we were hoping a quick up, plateau and a fast decline,"" Cuomo said. ""The decline is not as steep as the incline."" A British headteacher says he has spent Â£2,000 of his own money buying food for vulnerable families who are waiting to receive an alternative to free school meal vouchers. Lloyd Mason-Edwards, from Bradford in Yorkshire, said only about half the families eligible at his school had received them. The UK government has in England been converting free school meals for poorer children into supermarket vouchers since closing schools in March. He said the system was a ""shambles"" and was failing those in need. Read more. David ShukmanScience editor, BBC News Every time people cough, sneeze, talk or even breathe they
can spread droplets containing the virus. Thatâs the rather graphic conclusion of the Royal Society,
Britainâs oldest and most prestigious scientific academy. It highlights the risk of the virus being spread by people
who donât realise they have it - either because theyâve yet to develop symptoms
or because they never show symptoms at all. This is how an estimated 40-80% of coronavirus infections
happen and thatâs why the panel recommends face masks. The report stresses that high-quality masks should be
reserved for medical and care workers. But it says homemade face coverings can be effective, not at
protecting the wearer but at preventing the wearer from infecting others where
social distancing isnât possible, on public transport and in shops and
workplaces. The issue has become highly divisive. Some researchers say the Royal Societyâs report has ignored the risk to the public, for example, of contaminating themselves when handling masks. The UK government is still considering the evidence. It's hay fever season in some parts of the world, and the symptoms can be similar to those of coronavirus - so the UK's Royal College of General Practitioners is warning people not to
mix them up. It says it's concerned people may go outside thinking
they've just got the seasonal illness, when actually they have contracted the virus and should stay at home. Our health
correspondent Laura Foster explains how to tell the difference. This video can not be played Hay fever or coronavirus: The symptoms compared Philippa RoxbyHealth reporter, BBC News Whether people who are infected by the virus could catch it
for a second time is a question no-one yet knows the answer to. The key is whether antibodies build up in the bloodstream
when the body fights off this coronavirus, and how long they last afterwards to
protect people from further infections. Early research suggests good news. Most people do appear to develop
antibodies but how long they stick around for is still a mystery. Regularly following up people whoâve tested positive for a
number of years is the only way to find out how long immunity might last. The UK's health secretary himself is participating in a study
after contracting the virus several weeks ago. Are the antibodies still present? Are they at the same
level? Only time will tellâ¦ Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor We are, declared the prime minister at the end of last week, past the peak of the coronavirus pandemic in the UK. But he said we'd have to wait until this week to learn more about how we'll start to move out of the lockdown that has changed the country so dramatically in the past six weeks. Given that the crisis has affected pretty much everyone in one way or another, there is a fevered guessing game well under way about what moving out of the lockdown might look like - and it involves huge dilemmas for the government. With another six days to go before the prime minister is expected to spell out those choices, some things are clear. First and foremost, the government is not about to throw the country's doors open. Read more here on what easing lockdown could look like from our political editor Laura Kuenssberg. A view of the Finnish parliament in Helsinki Finland is going to allow restaurants, public services including libraries and sports facilities to reopen on 1 June. A ban on public meetings will also be eased from a maximum of 10 people to 50 people on the same day, the government said on Monday. Fewer Americans are remaining at home each day,according to a new study of mobile phone tracking data,externalfrom the University of Maryland. The anonymous location tracking data indicate a growing level of ""social distancing fatigue"", say the researchers at the Maryland Institute of Transportation. The researchers created a software code that creates a score for each state, called the Social Distancing Index, to determine how many residents are travelling away from their homes. Across the nation scores are dropping, indicating that gradually more and more Americans are venturing into public. Washington DC, where the rate of new cases is still growing, has the best social distancing score. Wyoming has the worst. Â© 2025 BBC.

NFL scraps all four 2020 London fixturesThe NFL decides to scrap the four games scheduled to take place in London later this year.,"The Oakland Raiders played the Chicago Bears at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium last year The NFL has cancelled the four games scheduled to take place in London later this year. Two fixtures involving the Jacksonville Jaguars were scheduled for Wembley, with two more matches due to be played at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. They will now be held in the US after organisers decided it was impossible to arrange games in a different continent because of the coronavirus pandemic. The London games were set for autumn 2020, but no firm dates had been set. It will be the first time an NFL regular season game has not been played in London since 2006. NFL commissioner Roger Goodell made the decision after consultation with a number of stakeholders including clubs, local governments and medical authorities. The Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said it was ""absolutely the right decision to ensure the safety of everyone involved in the sport"", while Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy said they ""fully appreciate the difficult decision that the NFL has had to make"". The NFL had also been planning to play one game at the Azteca Stadium in Mexico, but that too will now take place in the USA. NFL UK managing director Alistair Kirkwood added: ""The NFL's London Games have become a major part of the NFL season and the UK sports calendar. ""But the uncertainty in the current sporting landscape and the tremendous amount of long-term travel and planning required to stage successful London games mean this is the sensible decision to make."" BBC Sport's Simon Stone: This news is hardly unexpected given no-one knows when top-level sport will be played in the United Kingdom - and when it is, it will almost certainly be behind closed doors for the remainder of 2020 at least. However, it is another financial blow to both Tottenham and the Football Association, given the games have proved themselves to be useful money-spinners over the years. The company responsible for the technology that allows beer to be filled from the bottom of the glass upwards at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium posted on social media that they had taken Â£1m for the first of the two games last year - and with the club netting most of the profits from merchandise sales as well, it is fair to assume they have missed out on about Â£4m in income. It is yet another example of the financial pain Covid-19 is causing sport and underlines why Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy said in March he was facing the biggest problems he has encountered in 20 years at the club.

Amazon vice-president quits over virus firings,"A vice-president at Amazon has quit ""in dismay"" at the internet giant's crackdown on workers who criticised it over coronavirus safety measures. Tim Bray described the firing of protesters as ""evidence of a vein of toxicity running through the company culture"". Workers have criticised Amazon for not doing enough to protect warehouse staff against the virus. Amazon declined to comment, but has previously defended its actions. Mr Bray, who was a senior engineer at Amazon Web Services,set out in a blog why he had left the company,externalwhere he had worked for five years. The firm faces possible investigation of worker rights violations in New York, where the company fired the organiser of a small protest about safety conditions at a warehouse. Amazon boss Jeff Bezos adds $24bn to fortune Amazon workers strike over virus protection 'Not smart' memo shows Amazon's union stance Mr Bray said Amazon also fired office staff who had been organising another protest and had spoken out against the company on climate issues. ""At that point, I snapped,"" he wrote, adding that he raised his concerns internally first. ""That done, remaining an Amazon [vice-president] would have meant, in effect, signing off on actions I despised. So I resigned,"" he wrote. Allow Twitter content?

Mr Bray said working at the firm had been ""rewarding fun"" and his decision would cost him financially. ""What with big-tech salaries and share vestings, this will probably cost me over a million (pre-tax) dollars, not to mention the best job I've ever had, working with awfully good people. So I'm pretty blue,"" he wrote. However, he said: ""Firing whistleblowers isn't just a side-effect of macroeconomic forces, nor is it intrinsic to the function of free markets. ""It's evidence of a vein of toxicity running through the company culture. I choose neither to serve nor drink that poison."" By business reporter Zoe Thomas in New York Amazon had an image problem before the Covid-19 pandemic. The company has taken aggressive steps to stop unionisation in its warehouse. Its vast collection of personal data on users raised concerns about privacy. Its tax avoidance tactics had politicians across the globe asking why such a prosperous company led by the world's richest man shouldn't be paying more to public coffers. But these concerns dogged other big tech firms (Google, Facebook, Apple) as well. The coronavirus pandemic has given these companies a way to redeem their image. Tech giants are helping develop programs to track the virus, making it possible for other business to work remotely and keeping people connected to friends and family. Amazon should be at the head of this pack for image improvement. By keeping its delivery business going, Amazon has allowed millions of people to stay home. Instead, the treatment of its workers has become the story. The company has arguably tried to brush it under the rug, blaming the firing of workers who spoke up about warehouse conditions on other factors. Mr Bray's resignation may be a sign that won't be enough to appease senior staff within Amazon's ranks and, down the line, even shareholders. Shareholders were told Amazon wouldn't make a profit in the second quarter, because the firm would be spending more on warehouse safety and cleanliness. But if workers are still raising concerns, investors may question if the company is getting it right. This should be Amazon's moment to show shoppers, investors and government officials just how useful it can be, and that mammoth size is a helpful thing in a crisis like this. Instead, the conversation is being steered away from it, and if Amazon doesn't resolve these issues with the workforce, it may never have a chance to redeem its image. Amazon declined to comment on Mr Bray's characterisation. When asked previously about the firing of office staff, it has said it supports its staff's right to speak out, but added, ""That does not come with blanket immunity."" The firm has been facing renewed scrutiny over its business practices as the pandemic pushes the company into overdrive to fill online orders from people in lockdown. The e-commerce giant temporarily shut its six warehouses in France after a court ordered it to stop all but essential deliveries. Amazon's chief executive, Jeff Bezos -one of the world's richest people, with a fortune of $138bn - has also been asked to speak before the US Congress as part of a broader investigation of monopoly power. Amazon last week warned investors that the pandemic had forced costly changes to the business, including spending on protective gear and adjustments to operations that make its warehouses less efficient. It said it expected to spend $4bn (Â£3.2bn) - its anticipated quarterly profit - on coronavirus measures in the three months through June. Sales are booming, however, and it expects sales to rise as high as 28% in the current quarter.

Minister resigns over 'veiled threats' in letter,"Conor Burns with Boris Johnson at the 2018 Tory conference Conor Burns has resigned as a trade minister after a report found he used his position as an MP to intimidate a member of the public. TheCommons standards watchdog,externalsaid he made ""veiled threats"" to use parliamentary privilege to ""further his family's interests"" in a financial dispute involving his father. It had called for him to be suspended from Parliament for seven days. Mr Burns said he accepted the sanction ""unreservedly and without rancour"". In a letter to Prime Minister Boris Johnson after his resignation, he said the recommendation for a suspension made his decision to quit his post ""inevitable"". In February, Mr Burns wrote to a member of the public connected to a company with whom his father was in dispute over the repayment of a loan. He had written: ""I am acutely aware that my role in the public eye could well attract interest especially if I were to use parliamentary privilege to raise the case."" Parliamentary privilege protects MPs from being sued for defamation for speeches made in Parliament. What are the limits to parliamentary free speech? The Committee on Standards concluded Mr Burns had tried to intimidate the member of the public, and it was an abuse of his position as an MP which required a ""sanction more severe than apology"". It added that the dispute related purely to ""private family interests"" and had ""no connection"" with Mr Burns's duties as a Member of Parliament. Apologising to the committee in March, the Conservative MP for Bournemouth West said he should not have written to the member of the public ""in the terms I did"" using Commons-headed notepaper. He said he had been motivated by a desire to resolve the ""long-running"" dispute, which he said had a ""significant"" impact on his father's health. But in its report, the committee accused Mr Burns of being ""driven by a sense of anger which, in our view, has affected his judgement in this matter"". First elected to Parliament in 2010, Mr Burns was made a trade minister by Boris Johnson shortly after the prime minister entered Downing Street in July last year. He was a campaigner for Brexit during the EU referendum in 2016 and was a close friend of former Conservative Prime Minister Lady Thatcher, in her final years. Writing to Mr Burns after his resignation, Mr Johnson thanked him for his ""unstinting loyalty over recent years"" and said he would ""continue to add much from the backbenches"". Separately, another trade minister, Greg Hands, has been ordered to apologise to MPs for sending a Commons-headed letter to around 7,000 constituents in April 2019. The standards committee said the mailshot had breached rules which say MPs should not use Parliamentary stationery to their political advantage. It concluded that the letter, on topics including policing and transport, was ""unlikely"" to have been sent without regard to its ""political impact on potential voters"". It also accused the Conservative MP for Chelsea and Fulham of dragging the process out until after the 2019 general election, after initially offering to resolve the case in October.

Pandemic money worries drive surge in anxiety,"People who have lost income from shuttered businesses are feeling the most anxiety Nearly half of people in Britain experienced ""high anxiety"" as the country's lockdown began, an Office for National Statistics survey suggests. Anxiety levels were highest among an estimated 8.6 million people whose income fell, according to the weekly survey on the impact of coronavirus. Renters and the self-employed were also particularly affected. Measures of well-being were at their lowest levels since records began in 2011, the ONS said. The survey's finding suggested that more than 25 million people - 49.6% of over-16s in Britain - rated their anxiety as ""high"", more than double the amount who did so at the end of 2019. Those suffering the greatest level of worry were an estimated 2.6 million people who said they were struggling to pay bills. How to protect your mental health 'Following coronavirus news gave me a panic attack' Coronavirus: âItâs just anxiety, anxiety, anxietyâ The survey data suggested that 8.6 million people had seen their income fall, with this group also reporting anxiety levels 16% higher than average. Women reported anxiety levels 24% higher than men on average, with the ONS saying the difference might be because a larger proportion of women were either economically inactive, in lower paid jobs or working part time. David Shaw, who has been signed off work with anxiety, is trying to juggle providing for his family with the care of his severely disabled 16-year-old daughter, who has scoliosis. Mr Shaw, who manages a supermarket in Brandon, Suffolk, said: ""My daughter would be extremely vulnerable to the virus and I can't risk bringing the virus home to her."" The 43-year-old said his employer was a good company and gave him two weeks carers' leave, but he added he was no longer being paid. David Shaw said he did not feel safe going to work in case the virus infected his daughter Mr Shaw said: ""I can get a mortgage holiday but that is just one bill. I am not sure if the doctor will keep signing me off so I don't know what I will do."" He added he felt guilty that his colleagues were working while he was not but that he had to put his daughter's safety first. Lucy Tinkler, head of the quality of life team at the ONS, said: ""All measures of personal well-being, which include anxiety and happiness, are at their worst levels since we began collecting data in 2011."" ""The most recent data showed a slight improvement in anxiety compared to previous weeks, but remained much higher than before the pandemic."" A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise WILL I GET PAID IF I CAN'T WORK?Rules on sick pay, wages and time off PUBLIC TRANSPORT:Is it safe to travel? TESTING:Can I get tested for coronavirus? The ONS is carrying out a weekly opinions and lifestyle survey of about 1,500 people to understand the impact of the coronavirus on Britain, and comparing it with the results of a similar survey it normally carries out monthly. It found the average reported anxiety level rose from 2.97 out of 10 at the end of 2019 to 5.18 at the end of March as the lockdown was beginning. In the most recent survey, from 9 April to 20 April, that fell slightly to 4.2. Am I experiencing anxiety? Most people feel anxious from time to time but if it is affecting your life then there are things you can do to help yourself and ways to seek help. Symptoms of anxiety can include headaches, a faster heartbeat, feeling tense, difficulty sleeping, problems concentrating and not being able to enjoy leisure time. TheNHS suggests ways to manage,externalanxiety including breathing exercises, eating healthily and exercising. More advice is available from mental health charity Mind which has publishedwellbeing advice for the coronavirus pandemic,external. The proportion of Britons reporting low happiness also rose sharply from 8.4% at the end of 2019 to 20.7% at the end of March. Finances were the biggest worry for an estimated 5.3 million people, while 6.2 million were most concerned about their work and 8.5 million most concerned about their well-being, the survey suggested. Lucretia Thomas, a project adviser at Citizens Advice Enfield, said it had had a ""spike"" in people asking for advice about employment, benefits and debt issues as the pandemic prevented many people from working. ""The loss of income has really had a devastating effect on families, because their normal household expenses have increased,"" she said, explaining that families were often missing out on free school meals. People were also reporting that landlords had been issuing notices in preparation for when evictions might resume in June, she said, adding to the stress for some families. Others are saying that their employers are preparing to make them redundant once the furlough period is over. ""People are ringing us for reassurance, thinking that we might have a timeline for when this is over. A client asked me, 'When do you think my husband might be able to go back to work?' I'm not able to answer that question,"" Ms Thomas said.

World must 'pull together' to back vaccine,"Scientists in Beijing carrying out one of dozens of research projects into potential vaccines More than $8bn (Â£6.5bn) has been pledged to help develop a coronavirus vaccine and fund research into the diagnosis and treatment of the disease. Some 40 countries and donors took part in an online summit hosted by the EU. EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the money would help kickstart unprecedented global co-operation. She said it showed the true value of unity and humanity, but warned much more would be needed in the days ahead. In total, more than 30 countries, along with UN and philanthropic bodies and research institutes, made donations. Donors also included pop singer Madonna, who pledged â¬1m ($1.1m), said Ms von der Leyen, who set outthe Brussels-led initiative,externalon Friday. The European Commission pledged $1bn to fund research on a vaccine.  Norway matched the European Commission's contribution, and France has pledged â¬500m, as have Saudi Arabia and Germany.  Japan pledged more than $800m. The US and Russia did not take part.  China, where the virus originated in December, was represented by its ambassador to the European Union. Of the money raised, $4.4bn will go on vaccine development, some $2bn on the search for a treatment and $1.6bn for producing tests, the EU said. In her opening remarks at the summit, Ms von der Leyen said everyone must chip in to finance ""a truly global endeavour"". ""I believe 4 May will mark a turning point in our fight against coronavirus because today the world is coming together,"" she said. ""The partners are many, the goal is one: to defeat this virus."" UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, another co-host of the conference, said the ""more we pull together"" in sharing expertise, ""the faster our scientists will succeed"" in developing a vaccine. Mr Johnson, who spent three nights in intensive care with Covid-19, was to confirm the UK's pledge of Â£388m for vaccine research, testing and treatment during the conference. Along with the European Commission, the conference is being co-hosted by the UK, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Norway and Saudi Arabia. Emmanuel Macron and Angela Merkel, pictured last year, are among the world leaders who signed the letter Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel are also among those who have signed up to the initiative. In the open letter published in weekend newspapers, the leaders said the funds raised would ""kickstart an unprecedented global co-operation between scientists and regulators, industry and governments, international organisations, foundations and healthcare professionals"". ""If we can develop a vaccine that is produced by the world, for the whole world, this will be a unique global public good of the 21st Century,"" they added.

"UK banks get 45,000 loan applications on first day","Big UK banks received around 100,000 applications in a single day for a new loan scheme for small businesses. The Bounce Back Loans scheme went live on Monday, with Barclays seeing 200 applications in the first minute and Lloyds 5,000 within three hours. It offers loans up to Â£50,000 and is designed to be simpler and quicker than the existing Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme (CBILS). Barclays said its first bounce back loans will be awarded within 24 hours. CBILS offer loans of up to Â£5m and are available for companies with a turnover of less than Â£45m. However, the loans have come in for criticism by some businesses, especially smaller ones. Banks can often apply their usual lending criteria, which makes it harder for smaller enterprises to qualify while locked down. On Thursday, the number of CBILS loans agreed was 8,638, down from more than 9,000 the previous week. Of 52,807 loans applied for, almost 28,000 have still to be approved. Banks have been criticised for delays in handing out loans but have blamed the heavy workload, the need to complete the necessary credit checks and a shortage of staff. The government insists the new bounce back loans will be easier to apply for. However, UK Finance, which represents banks, emphasised that firms should ""think very carefully before taking on new debt"". Of the UK's largest banks, Lloyds Banking Group said it received the most with 17,000 applications so far, while HSBC received 12,830 and 10,000 applied to NatWest. Barclays said it was ready to approve 6,000. Barclays denied its online system failed, but said that some customers may have to wait. ""Due to the extremely high level of demand, some customers will see availability later on today,"" it said. There are about 5.8 million firms in the UK with fewer than 50 staff While the loans are aimed at smaller businesses and sole traders, with Â£2,000 to Â£50,000 on offer, there is no limit on the size of business that can apply. To qualify, a firm must have been trading on 1 March this year and not have been in financial difficulty. In other words, the loans are not intended to bail out failing businesses. While these are early days, business leaders have been generally positive about the bounce-back scheme. It ""offers real hope"" for small firms, says Mike Cherry, head of the Federation of Small Businesses. Empty High Streets have become symbolic of the crisis facing small traders Businesses should apply through the bank with which they have a business account. The Treasury says funds should then be available ""within days"". Borrowers answer seven questions on an online form including information about turnover, tax details, bank account and how the lockdown and Covid-19 has impacted your business. Applicants do not have to provide security and personal guarantees. Ten banks have been accredited to provide the loans. However, the expectation is that because of the simplicity of the process, banks will transfer the money far quicker than CBIL loans. The lockdown hit just as Rachel Sweet's one-year-old business was entering its busiest trading period. She also had expansion plans. The bounce-back loans could prove a lifeline, she says, and her application has already gone in, via HSBC. Bath-based Sweet Drinks sells, promotes and organises tastings based on produce from the West Country. With the summer season and big outdoor events approaching, ""we were thinking about taking the business to the next level"". She estimates she lost 60% of her business when lockdown effectively closed the events season. Rachel says: ""Given all the hurdles and rejections we were reading about with the business interruption scheme, we decided to wait a little. ""This new scheme looks much more suitable for us. We've got enough money to cover our costs for a while,"" she said. ""We had hoped sales over the next few months would generate enough money to launch a new website and a mail order business."" Six months ago she was thinking of taking out a big bank loan to fund expansion, financing that would have come with a hefty interest rate. That could have made the current situation worse. The stress levels are high, she says. ""But luckily I'm a glass-half-full person, so I'm staying positive and just trying to do my best given the business environment."" The loan application took no time at all, requiring some basic business details, she says. ""It was a very straightforward process. I hope to hear by the end of the week. Fingers crossed."" The government will cover the cost of fees and interest for the first year. Businesses will only begin repaying the loan after 12 months. All lenders will charge a flat rate of 2.5% and the loans will last up to six years. This bounce-back rate is likely to be lower than most CBILS as they are less risky. The government is guaranteeing 100% of the loan from lenders if the firm defaults. With CBILS, the guarantee is 80% of the money. Both the Treasury and banks are keen to emphasise that they are loans that need to be repaid. The tax authorities have promised close inspection of all loans given. Chancellor Rishi Sunak came under strong pressure to introduce loans that were 100% government-backed You can still apply for one of these new loans. You can switch your CBILS application to a bounce back one if it was under Â£50,000. Or, if you already have a CBIL you can convert it, the Treasury says. Applicants do not have to stay with existing lenders. The major High Street banks are currently offering the bulk of the loans, although accreditation could be expanded to include other specialist small business backers and financial firms. Stephen Jones, chief executive of UK Finance, told the BBC the affordability checks would ""be lighter"", but firms should still ""think very carefully about their ability to repay the loan"". Despite the government guarantee, banks are required to first chase firms for money if they do not repay the loan. That means seizing assets and pursuing business owners through the courts. Mr Jones said: ""These are loans, not grants, so if a business is already indebted and taking on further debt, they should think carefully before making an application."" The British Chambers of Commerce has said that about 30% of its members say they cannot afford to take on more debt.

NFL scraps all four 2020 London fixtures,"The Oakland Raiders played the Chicago Bears at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium last year The NFL has cancelled the four games scheduled to take place in London later this year. Two fixtures involving the Jacksonville Jaguars were scheduled for Wembley, with two more matches due to be played at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. They will now be held in the US after organisers decided it was impossible to arrange games in a different continent because of the coronavirus pandemic. The London games were set for autumn 2020, but no firm dates had been set. It will be the first time an NFL regular season game has not been played in London since 2006. NFL commissioner Roger Goodell made the decision after consultation with a number of stakeholders including clubs, local governments and medical authorities. The Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said it was ""absolutely the right decision to ensure the safety of everyone involved in the sport"", while Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy said they ""fully appreciate the difficult decision that the NFL has had to make"". The NFL had also been planning to play one game at the Azteca Stadium in Mexico, but that too will now take place in the USA. NFL UK managing director Alistair Kirkwood added: ""The NFL's London Games have become a major part of the NFL season and the UK sports calendar. ""But the uncertainty in the current sporting landscape and the tremendous amount of long-term travel and planning required to stage successful London games mean this is the sensible decision to make."" BBC Sport's Simon Stone: This news is hardly unexpected given no-one knows when top-level sport will be played in the United Kingdom - and when it is, it will almost certainly be behind closed doors for the remainder of 2020 at least. However, it is another financial blow to both Tottenham and the Football Association, given the games have proved themselves to be useful money-spinners over the years. The company responsible for the technology that allows beer to be filled from the bottom of the glass upwards at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium posted on social media that they had taken Â£1m for the first of the two games last year - and with the club netting most of the profits from merchandise sales as well, it is fair to assume they have missed out on about Â£4m in income. It is yet another example of the financial pain Covid-19 is causing sport and underlines why Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy said in March he was facing the biggest problems he has encountered in 20 years at the club.

Coronavirus: 'Missing link' species may never be found,"A number of early cases in the pandemic were linked to the Wuhan Seafood Market It was a matter of ""when not if"" an animal passed the coronavirus from wild bats to humans, scientists say. But it remains unclear whether that animal was sold in the now infamous Wuhan wildlife market in China. The World Health Organization says that all evidence points to the virus's natural origin, but some scientists now say it might never be known how the first person was infected. Trade in wild animals is under scrutiny as source of this ""spillover"". But when wildlife is bought and sold in almost every country in the world, controlling it - let alone banning it - is far from straightforward. Tackling it on a global scale could be the route to stopping a future pandemic before it starts. Is there any evidence for coronavirus lab release idea? The race to find the source of coronavirus in wildlife Coronavirus: 'Pets no risk to owners' vets stress The virus originated in bats and was probably passed to humans via an 'intermediate host' Global health researchers have, for many years, understood how the trade in wild animals provides a source of species-to-species disease transmission. As life-changing as this particular outbreak has been for so much of the global population, it is actually one of many that the trade has been linked to. As the WHO's technical lead on Covid-19, Dr Maria Van Kerkhove, told the BBC: ""We were preparing for something like this as it's not a matter of if, it is a matter of when."" Infectious disease experts agree that, like most emerging human disease, this virus initially jumped undetected across the species barrier. Prof Andrew Cunningham, from the Zoological Society of London, explained: ""We've actually been expecting something like this to happen for a while. ""These diseases are emerging more frequently in recent years as a result of human encroachment into wild habitat and increased contact and use of wild animals by people."" Officials seize civet cats in Xinyuan wildlife market in Guangzhou to prevent the spread of Sars The virus that causes Covid-19 joins a murky list of household name viruses - including Ebola, rabies, Sars and Mers - that have originated in wild bat populations. Some of the now extensive body of evidence about bat viruses, and their ability to infect humans, comes from seeking the source of the 2003 outbreak of Sars, a very closely related coronavirus.It was only in 2017 though that scientists pinned down the ""rich gene pool of bat Sars-related coronaviruses"" in a single cave in China.,external- the possible source of the pandemic. These viruses have resided in the bodies of bats for millennia, but are pre-programmed with the ability to infect a humans; the key that unlocks some of our cells, where they can replicate. ""In the case of Sars-CoV-2 the key is a virus protein called Spike and the main lock to enter a cell is a receptor called ACE2,"" explained Prof David Robertson, a virologist from the University of Glasgow. ""The coronavirus is not only able to fit that ACE2 lock, ""it's actually doing this many times better than Sars-1 [the virus that caused the 2003 outbreak] does"", he said. Coronaviruses under the microscope That perfect fit could explain why the coronavirus is so easily transmitted from person to person; its contagiousness has outpaced our efforts to contain it. But bringing the bat virus to the door of a human cell is where the trade in wildlife plays an important role. Most of us have heard that this virus ""started"" in a wildlife market in Wuhan. But the source of the virus - an animal with this pathogen in its body - was not found in the market. ""The initial cluster of infections was associated with the market - that is circumstantial evidence,"" explained Prof James Wood from the University of Cambridge. ""The infection could have come from somewhere else and just, by chance, clustered around people there. But given that it is an animal virus, the market association is highly suggestive."" Prof Cunningham agreed; wildlife markets, he explained, are hotspots for animal diseases to find new hosts. ""Mixing large numbers of species under poor hygienic and welfare conditions, and species that wouldn't normally come close together gives opportunities for pathogens to jump species to species,"" he explained. Animals rescued from the exotic pet trade often have to be protected from human disease Many wildlife viruses in the past have come into humans via a second species - one that is farmed, or hunted and sold on a market. Prof Woods explained: ""The original Sars virus was transmitted into the human population via an epidemic in Palm civets, which were being traded around southern China to be eaten. ""That was very important to know because there was an epidemic in the Palm civets themselves, which had to be controlled to stop an ongoing spillover into humans."" In the search for the missing link in this particular transmission chain, scientists found clues pointing to mink, ferrets and even turtles as a host.Similar viruses were found in the bodies of rare and widely trafficked pangolins, but none of these suspect species has been shown to be involved in this outbreak. What we do know is that our contact with, and trading of, wild animals puts us in the path of new diseases that are silently seeking a host. Camels can harbour the novel coronavirus, Mers ""Trying to make sure that we are not bringing wildlife into direct contact with ourselves or with other domestic animals is a very important part of this equation,"" said Prof Wood. ""And there have been various campaigns to ban all trade in animals and all contact with wildlife,"" he added, ""but what you do then is penalise some of the poorest people in the world. In many cases, by introducing measures like that you drive trade underground, which makes it far harder to do anything about."" The WHO has already called for stricter hygiene and safety standards for so-called wet markets in China. But in many cases - such as the trade in bush meat in Sub-Saharan Africa, which was linked with the Ebola outbreak - markets are informal and therefore very difficult to regulate. ""You can't do it from an office in London or in Geneva; you have to do that locally on the ground in every country,"" added Prof Wood. Dr Maria Van Kerkhove agreed: ""It's very important we work with population and people who are working at the animal/human interface - people who work with wildlife."" What that will be is a truly global and highly complicated effort. But the Covid-19 outbreak appears to have shown us the cost of the alternative.

Amazon vice president quits at virus firings,"A vice-president at Amazon has quit ""in dismay"" at the internet giant's crackdown on workers who criticised it over coronavirus safety measures. Tim Bray described the firing of protesters as ""evidence of a vein of toxicity running through the company culture"". Workers have criticised Amazon for not doing enough to protect warehouse staff against the virus. Amazon declined to comment, but has previously defended its actions. Mr Bray, who was a senior engineer at Amazon Web Services,set out in a blog why he had left the company,externalwhere he had worked for five years. The firm faces possible investigation of worker rights violations in New York, where the company fired the organiser of a small protest about safety conditions at a warehouse. Amazon boss Jeff Bezos adds $24bn to fortune Amazon workers strike over virus protection 'Not smart' memo shows Amazon's union stance Mr Bray said Amazon also fired office staff who had been organising another protest and had spoken out against the company on climate issues. ""At that point, I snapped,"" he wrote, adding that he raised his concerns internally first. ""That done, remaining an Amazon [vice-president] would have meant, in effect, signing off on actions I despised. So I resigned,"" he wrote. Allow Twitter content?

Mr Bray said working at the firm had been ""rewarding fun"" and his decision would cost him financially. ""What with big-tech salaries and share vestings, this will probably cost me over a million (pre-tax) dollars, not to mention the best job I've ever had, working with awfully good people. So I'm pretty blue,"" he wrote. However, he said: ""Firing whistleblowers isn't just a side-effect of macroeconomic forces, nor is it intrinsic to the function of free markets. ""It's evidence of a vein of toxicity running through the company culture. I choose neither to serve nor drink that poison."" By business reporter Zoe Thomas in New York Amazon had an image problem before the Covid-19 pandemic. The company has taken aggressive steps to stop unionisation in its warehouse. Its vast collection of personal data on users raised concerns about privacy. Its tax avoidance tactics had politicians across the globe asking why such a prosperous company led by the world's richest man shouldn't be paying more to public coffers. But these concerns dogged other big tech firms (Google, Facebook, Apple) as well. The coronavirus pandemic has given these companies a way to redeem their image. Tech giants are helping develop programs to track the virus, making it possible for other business to work remotely and keeping people connected to friends and family. Amazon should be at the head of this pack for image improvement. By keeping its delivery business going, Amazon has allowed millions of people to stay home. Instead, the treatment of its workers has become the story. The company has arguably tried to brush it under the rug, blaming the firing of workers who spoke up about warehouse conditions on other factors. Mr Bray's resignation may be a sign that won't be enough to appease senior staff within Amazon's ranks and, down the line, even shareholders. Shareholders were told Amazon wouldn't make a profit in the second quarter, because the firm would be spending more on warehouse safety and cleanliness. But if workers are still raising concerns, investors may question if the company is getting it right. This should be Amazon's moment to show shoppers, investors and government officials just how useful it can be, and that mammoth size is a helpful thing in a crisis like this. Instead, the conversation is being steered away from it, and if Amazon doesn't resolve these issues with the workforce, it may never have a chance to redeem its image. Amazon declined to comment on Mr Bray's characterisation. When asked previously about the firing of office staff, it has said it supports its staff's right to speak out, but added, ""That does not come with blanket immunity."" The firm has been facing renewed scrutiny over its business practices as the pandemic pushes the company into overdrive to fill online orders from people in lockdown. The e-commerce giant temporarily shut its six warehouses in France after a court ordered it to stop all but essential deliveries. Amazon's chief executive, Jeff Bezos -one of the world's richest people, with a fortune of $138bn - has also been asked to speak before the US Congress as part of a broader investigation of monopoly power. Amazon last week warned investors that the pandemic had forced costly changes to the business, including spending on protective gear and adjustments to operations that make its warehouses less efficient. It said it expected to spend $4bn (Â£3.2bn) - its anticipated quarterly profit - on coronavirus measures in the three months through June. Sales are booming, however, and it expects sales to rise as high as 28% in the current quarter.

App stores approve UK contact-tracing app for testIsle of Wight council staff and healthcare workers will be invited to start testing app on Tuesday.Technology,"A test version of the NHS's coronavirus contact-tracing app has been published to Apple and Google's app stores. Council staff and healthcare workers on the Isle of Wight will be invited to install it on Tuesday, ahead of a wider roll-out on the island on Thursday. Project chiefs have said their so-called ""centralised"" approach gives them advantages over a rival scheme advocated by the US tech giants and some privacy experts. But fresh concerns have been raised. The Information Commissioner's Office has declared that ""as a general rule, a decentralised approach"" would better follow its principle that organisations should minimise the amount of personal data they collect. The House of Commons' Human Rights Select Committee also discussed fears about plans to extend the app to record location data. ""There is an inherent risk that if you create a system that can be added to incrementally, you could do so in a way that is very privacy invasive,"" cautioned law professor Orla Lynskey. This video can not be played Matt Hancock said Isle of Wight residents using the app ""will be saving lives"" But NHSX - the health service's digital innovation unit - has stressed that: use of the app will be voluntary the only personal data stored by the app at the start will be the first part of the user's postcode additional location data will only be recorded if users agree to a further opt-in request ""Please download the app to protect the NHS and save lives,"" Health Secretary Matt Hancock urged Isle of Wight residents. ""By downloading the app, you're protecting your own health, you're protecting the health of your loved ones, and the health of the community."" The NHS Covid-19 app is intended to supplement medical tests and contact-tracing interviews carried out by humans, in order to prevent a resurgence of Covid-19 when lockdown measures are eased. This video can not be played WATCH: What is contact tracing and how does it work? It works by using Bluetooth signals to detect when two people's smartphones are close to each other. If one person later registers themselves as being infected, an alert can be sent to others judged to be at high risk of contagion. This might be based on the fact they were exposed to the same person for a long period of time or that there had been multiple instances of them being in the vicinity of different people. The trial on the Isle of Wight will help NHSX test how well the system works in practice, as well as judge how willing a population is to install and use the software. It follows a smaller experiment on an RAF base. Although the app is live, it is effectively hidden on the iOS and Android marketplaces, and residents will need to follow a set of instructions to install it. Users will be asked to enter the first part of their postcode but not their name or other personal details While in theory there is nothing to prevent the details being shared and used by others elsewhere, NHSX hopes this will not happen as it could confuse the feedback it receives. Ahead of the trial, NHSX chief Matthew Gould acknowledged that there would ""inevitably be unintended consequences"" and that ""if we think there is a better way of doing what we need to do, we won't hesitate to change"". But he added that if citizens ""want to carry on saving lives, protecting the NHS and get the country back on its feet, then downloading the app is one way they can do that"". NHSX's app will send back details of the logged Bluetooth ""handshakes"" to a UK-based computer server to do the contact matching, rather carrying out the process on the handsets themselves. Apple, Google and hundreds of privacy advocates have raised concerns that this risks hackers or even the state itself being able to re-identify anonymised users, and thus learn details about their social circles. But NHSX has consulted ethicists andGCHQ's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC),externalon the matter, and believes safeguards are in place to minimise the risk of this happening. Furthermore, it believes any such concerns are outweighed by the benefits of adopting a centralised approach. It says a centralised app will let it: spot geographical hotspots where the disease is spreading work out how to optimise the app's algorithms to make its risk-model as accurate as possible, which in turn should help it decide who needs to be told to self-isolate or request a test gain fresh insights into how the virus spreads, such as the degree to which transmission becomes less likely the more time passes since first symptoms NHSX believes another major benefit is that its app can make use of people self-diagnosing themselves before they obtain test results. The app will allow people to self-diagnose themselves by answering a series of questions This would only be possible, Mr Gould explained, because NHSX could spot ""anomalous patterns of activity"" indicating that people were lying to the app for malicious reasons. But the DP3T group - which promotes the decentralised approach - believes this claim is misleading. ""I have not seen any evidence that this would do anything but spot very large-scale and quite clumsy attacks,"" explained Prof Michael Veale. ""The only way to make sure that people can be held to account for submitting false reports is to identify them [which takes you down] a slippery slope."" What is the UK's new contact tracing plan? NHS rejects Apple-Google coronavirus app plan Apple and Google accelerate coronavirus contact tracing apps plan Another criticism of NHSX's approach is that it puts the UK at odds with Ireland, Germany, Switzerland and a growing list of other nations, which are pursuing decentralised apps. The fear is that UK citizens may face tougher restrictions on international travel if its system is not interoperable with others. Mr Gould said that NHSX was ""talking to a range of countries [to] make sure that systems can talk to each other,"" adding that France and Japan were among others developing centralised apps. But Prof Veale warned that any attempt to try to join up the two systems risked ""the worst of both worlds"". ""I don't think it's just a mater of political will. It would be a matter of sacrificing the privacy-by-design within both systems."" A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise WILL I GET PAID IF I CAN'T WORK?Rules on sick pay, wages and time off PUBLIC TRANSPORT:Is it safe to travel? TESTING:Can I get tested for coronavirus? The Isle of Wight's Green Party - which has nine locally-elected councillors - has also expressed its doubts. ""The Isle of Wight has a significantly older and more vulnerable population [and] the island's one hospital could be overwhelmed if... people feel they do no need to stick to lockdown measures due to the rolling out of this app,"" it said. But the government's coordinator for testing said the island was ""well-equipped"" to cope. ""It's quite a large population and there is a benefit in the fact that travel on and off the island is relatively restricted - the ferries are there, but they're running relatively infrequently,"" added Public Health England's Prof John Newton.

"Pandemic money worries drive surge in anxietyAlmost half of Britons have suffered ""high anxiety"", with millions losing income, an ONS survey suggests.","People who have lost income from shuttered businesses are feeling the most anxiety Nearly half of people in Britain experienced ""high anxiety"" as the country's lockdown began, an Office for National Statistics survey suggests. Anxiety levels were highest among an estimated 8.6 million people whose income fell, according to the weekly survey on the impact of coronavirus. Renters and the self-employed were also particularly affected. Measures of well-being were at their lowest levels since records began in 2011, the ONS said. The survey's finding suggested that more than 25 million people - 49.6% of over-16s in Britain - rated their anxiety as ""high"", more than double the amount who did so at the end of 2019. Those suffering the greatest level of worry were an estimated 2.6 million people who said they were struggling to pay bills. How to protect your mental health 'Following coronavirus news gave me a panic attack' Coronavirus: âItâs just anxiety, anxiety, anxietyâ The survey data suggested that 8.6 million people had seen their income fall, with this group also reporting anxiety levels 16% higher than average. Women reported anxiety levels 24% higher than men on average, with the ONS saying the difference might be because a larger proportion of women were either economically inactive, in lower paid jobs or working part time. David Shaw, who has been signed off work with anxiety, is trying to juggle providing for his family with the care of his severely disabled 16-year-old daughter, who has scoliosis. Mr Shaw, who manages a supermarket in Brandon, Suffolk, said: ""My daughter would be extremely vulnerable to the virus and I can't risk bringing the virus home to her."" The 43-year-old said his employer was a good company and gave him two weeks carers' leave, but he added he was no longer being paid. David Shaw said he did not feel safe going to work in case the virus infected his daughter Mr Shaw said: ""I can get a mortgage holiday but that is just one bill. I am not sure if the doctor will keep signing me off so I don't know what I will do."" He added he felt guilty that his colleagues were working while he was not but that he had to put his daughter's safety first. Lucy Tinkler, head of the quality of life team at the ONS, said: ""All measures of personal well-being, which include anxiety and happiness, are at their worst levels since we began collecting data in 2011."" ""The most recent data showed a slight improvement in anxiety compared to previous weeks, but remained much higher than before the pandemic."" A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise WILL I GET PAID IF I CAN'T WORK?Rules on sick pay, wages and time off PUBLIC TRANSPORT:Is it safe to travel? TESTING:Can I get tested for coronavirus? The ONS is carrying out a weekly opinions and lifestyle survey of about 1,500 people to understand the impact of the coronavirus on Britain, and comparing it with the results of a similar survey it normally carries out monthly. It found the average reported anxiety level rose from 2.97 out of 10 at the end of 2019 to 5.18 at the end of March as the lockdown was beginning. In the most recent survey, from 9 April to 20 April, that fell slightly to 4.2. Am I experiencing anxiety? Most people feel anxious from time to time but if it is affecting your life then there are things you can do to help yourself and ways to seek help. Symptoms of anxiety can include headaches, a faster heartbeat, feeling tense, difficulty sleeping, problems concentrating and not being able to enjoy leisure time. TheNHS suggests ways to manage,externalanxiety including breathing exercises, eating healthily and exercising. More advice is available from mental health charity Mind which has publishedwellbeing advice for the coronavirus pandemic,external. The proportion of Britons reporting low happiness also rose sharply from 8.4% at the end of 2019 to 20.7% at the end of March. Finances were the biggest worry for an estimated 5.3 million people, while 6.2 million were most concerned about their work and 8.5 million most concerned about their well-being, the survey suggested. Lucretia Thomas, a project adviser at Citizens Advice Enfield, said it had had a ""spike"" in people asking for advice about employment, benefits and debt issues as the pandemic prevented many people from working. ""The loss of income has really had a devastating effect on families, because their normal household expenses have increased,"" she said, explaining that families were often missing out on free school meals. People were also reporting that landlords had been issuing notices in preparation for when evictions might resume in June, she said, adding to the stress for some families. Others are saying that their employers are preparing to make them redundant once the furlough period is over. ""People are ringing us for reassurance, thinking that we might have a timeline for when this is over. A client asked me, 'When do you think my husband might be able to go back to work?' I'm not able to answer that question,"" Ms Thomas said.

With more than one million cases, the US has the highest number of confirmed infections in the world. The country has also recorded more than 68,000 deaths - and on MondayPresident Trump warned that the death toll may reach 100,000. New York State remains the epicentre, as shown in the chart below. View that and more charts tracking the global pandemic in thelatest guide from BBC News' Visual and Data Journalism Team. Cagil KasapogluBBC News, Turkish Turkey's coronavirus containment restrictions will be eased by mid-May, including reopening of shopping centres, hair saloons and some stores, President Tayyip Erdogan said on Monday. Turkey has been imposing blanket curfews over the last few weekends in 31 cities. Over-65s will be allowed to go out ""only within walking distance"" for a few hours a day from 10 May. Similar rules will apply to children. Erdogan said shopping malls, barber shops and some stores will be allowed to reopen on 11 May. Universities will return on 15 June. But Erdogan warned that much stricter measures would be put in place if the public does not abide by the rules. âThis normalisation plan does not mean weâll be back to our days as of the first days of March,â he said. According to Turkeyâs Ministry of Health, the death toll in the country has risen to 3,461. The National Rifle Association (NRA) - the largest pro-gun lobbying group in the US - has furloughed workers (given them temporary leave) and cut salaries due to the coronavirus pandemic. The group's annual convention - which probably would have drawn a visit from President Trump - has also been cancelled. ""The cancellation of the annual meeting had a significant financial impact but, beyond that, the health crisis has caused us to postpone countless fundraising and membership events,"" said NRA spokesman Andrew Arulanandam. The virus has caused a record spike in US gun sales, according to the FBI. How the coronavirus led to the highest-ever spike in US gun sales The number of people who have died with coronavirus around the world has passed a quarter of a million - rising to 250,134, according to figures published by Johns Hopkins University. A music shop prepares to open in Colorado At least six more US states are loosening social distancing measures starting on Monday. Gyms in Arkansas can resume operation, as long as clients have their temperatures screened before entering. Florida beaches and parks can reopen, but not in the Miami area. Missouri businesses can open, but customers must keep six feet (two metres) apart. Nonessential businesses in Colorado are also permitted to reopen, but with limited capacity. Ohioâs governor is allowing manufacturing, construction and office work to resume starting on Monday. Retail shops are expected to reopen on 12 May. Indiana is moving towards its second stage of reopening and is allowing social gatherings of up to 25 people. But residents over 65 are encouraged to remain at home. Around half of US states have begun taking steps to reopen, even as health officials warn that the pandemic is not yet under control. The number of unemployed Austrians reached a record high in April, the country's news agency ANA reports. Figures showed 571,477 people, or 12.8% of the population, were unemployed - up more than 210,000 from the same time last year. Austria, which has 15,621 coronavirus cases and 600 deaths according to Johns Hopkins University, began relaxing its restrictions and allowing some shops to reopen in mid-April. Football matches in the UK are likely to be played behind closed doors for an extended period because of bans on mass gatherings amid the coronavirus pandemic. FA chairman Greg Clarke has saidit is hard to see fans returning ""any time soon"" and the Premier League is preparing for the possibility of playing next season without fans. So what would be the impact of a season without fans on the Premier League clubs? BBC Sport and football finance lecturer Kieran Maguire has taken a look. Research suggests Arsenal generated nearly a quarter of their total income from matchday last season, making them vulnerable financially. Read more here Players in the top two flights of football in Spain will return to training this week with the hope of the leagues restarting in June. They will initially train alone but a ""staggered return to training"" will be implemented with players training together at a later date. Football in Spain was suspended indefinitely in March because of the coronavirus pandemic. In the UK, the Premier League hopes to resume on 8 June but there isdisagreement between the clubs on how to move forward. In Germany, clubs have been training in groups before a planned return to training as teams. The German league could restart on 16 or 23 May. It has already been announced that the top leagues in France and the Netherlands will not resume. UK officials said on Monday it was ""perfectly reasonable"" to look at how guidance about the next
stage of coronavirus restrictions could apply to different age groups. The prime ministerâs spokesman pointed to the fact that over-70s had already been
advised to take particular care and minimise contact with others outside their
households, due to the fact they were classed as a clinically vulnerable group. He
said: âAs we go forward itâs perfectly reasonable we look at how the guidance
will apply for different age bands and we will continue to be guided by the
science.â People over 70 are more likely to have serious symptoms of the virus, but they are not automatically in the ""extremely vulnerable"" group of people who have been asked to ""shield"". Over the weekend, several public figures, including actor Michael Palin, called on the government to ensure older people were not unfairly separated from society as lockdown was lifted. Prime Minister Edouard Philippe spoke about religious services at a news conference on Monday France could allow religious services to resume earlier than planned if the easing of the lockdown this month does not result in an increase in the infection rate of coronavirus. France is set to ease its lockdown on 11 May but it had been indicated that religious ceremonies would still be banned until at least 2 June. The Christian holy day of Pentecost, celebrated 50 days after Easter Sunday, falls on 1 June. Nick Thorpe, BBC News Exams at Szerb Antal secondary school in Budapest In Hungary 84,000 pupils were back in classrooms on Monday to
sit their high school exams, despite the country's lockdown. Most appeared relieved that the
exams were not postponed,
but teachersâ unions and parents voiced concerns that pupils and staff might
spread coronavirus. Written exams have been condensed into two weeks, and no oral
exams will be held. The mood was festive outside the Bela
Bartok music gymnasium in central Budapest. Pupils who hadnât seen
each other for six weeks gathered in their best clothes, bumping elbows or
knuckles in greeting, but there was no hugging or kissing. They filed into classrooms one by one, and about half wore face
masks. At some schools police patrolled to enforce social distancing, but
not here. Inside, seven students sat in each classroom. Masks were not
compulsory during the exam, although supervisors kept theirs on. The main teachersâ union was not consulted by the government, and opposed
the decision to go ahead with the exams. With 3,000 known coronavirus infections and 350 deaths, the peak
has still not been reached in Hungary. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said in his Monday briefing that current data showed that no region of the state - which remains the epicentre of the pandemic in the US - is yet ready to reopen. There were 226 deaths in New York state on Sunday, down from 280 in the previous 24-hour period. But Cuomo said that new cases and deaths were not dropping as quickly as they first rose in the earliest days of the outbreak. ""Unfortunately we were hoping a quick up, plateau and a fast decline,"" Cuomo said. ""The decline is not as steep as the incline."" A British headteacher says he has spent Â£2,000 of his own money buying food for vulnerable families who are waiting to receive an alternative to free school meal vouchers. Lloyd Mason-Edwards, from Bradford in Yorkshire, said only about half the families eligible at his school had received them. The UK government has in England been converting free school meals for poorer children into supermarket vouchers since closing schools in March. He said the system was a ""shambles"" and was failing those in need. Read more. David ShukmanScience editor, BBC News Every time people cough, sneeze, talk or even breathe they
can spread droplets containing the virus. Thatâs the rather graphic conclusion of the Royal Society,
Britainâs oldest and most prestigious scientific academy. It highlights the risk of the virus being spread by people
who donât realise they have it - either because theyâve yet to develop symptoms
or because they never show symptoms at all. This is how an estimated 40-80% of coronavirus infections
happen and thatâs why the panel recommends face masks. The report stresses that high-quality masks should be
reserved for medical and care workers. But it says homemade face coverings can be effective, not at
protecting the wearer but at preventing the wearer from infecting others where
social distancing isnât possible, on public transport and in shops and
workplaces. The issue has become highly divisive. Some researchers say the Royal Societyâs report has ignored the risk to the public, for example, of contaminating themselves when handling masks. The UK government is still considering the evidence. It's hay fever season in some parts of the world, and the symptoms can be similar to those of coronavirus - so the UK's Royal College of General Practitioners is warning people not to
mix them up. It says it's concerned people may go outside thinking
they've just got the seasonal illness, when actually they have contracted the virus and should stay at home. Our health
correspondent Laura Foster explains how to tell the difference. This video can not be played Hay fever or coronavirus: The symptoms compared Philippa RoxbyHealth reporter, BBC News Whether people who are infected by the virus could catch it
for a second time is a question no-one yet knows the answer to. The key is whether antibodies build up in the bloodstream
when the body fights off this coronavirus, and how long they last afterwards to
protect people from further infections. Early research suggests good news. Most people do appear to develop
antibodies but how long they stick around for is still a mystery. Regularly following up people whoâve tested positive for a
number of years is the only way to find out how long immunity might last. The UK's health secretary himself is participating in a study
after contracting the virus several weeks ago. Are the antibodies still present? Are they at the same
level? Only time will tellâ¦ Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor We are, declared the prime minister at the end of last week, past the peak of the coronavirus pandemic in the UK. But he said we'd have to wait until this week to learn more about how we'll start to move out of the lockdown that has changed the country so dramatically in the past six weeks. Given that the crisis has affected pretty much everyone in one way or another, there is a fevered guessing game well under way about what moving out of the lockdown might look like - and it involves huge dilemmas for the government. With another six days to go before the prime minister is expected to spell out those choices, some things are clear. First and foremost, the government is not about to throw the country's doors open. Read more here on what easing lockdown could look like from our political editor Laura Kuenssberg. A view of the Finnish parliament in Helsinki Finland is going to allow restaurants, public services including libraries and sports facilities to reopen on 1 June. A ban on public meetings will also be eased from a maximum of 10 people to 50 people on the same day, the government said on Monday. Fewer Americans are remaining at home each day,according to a new study of mobile phone tracking data,externalfrom the University of Maryland. The anonymous location tracking data indicate a growing level of ""social distancing fatigue"", say the researchers at the Maryland Institute of Transportation. The researchers created a software code that creates a score for each state, called the Social Distancing Index, to determine how many residents are travelling away from their homes. Across the nation scores are dropping, indicating that gradually more and more Americans are venturing into public. Washington DC, where the rate of new cases is still growing, has the best social distancing score. Wyoming has the worst. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Minister resigns over 'veiled threats' in letterConor Burns used his position as an MP to intimidate a member of the public, standards watchdog finds.UK Politics","Conor Burns with Boris Johnson at the 2018 Tory conference Conor Burns has resigned as a trade minister after a report found he used his position as an MP to intimidate a member of the public. TheCommons standards watchdog,externalsaid he made ""veiled threats"" to use parliamentary privilege to ""further his family's interests"" in a financial dispute involving his father. It had called for him to be suspended from Parliament for seven days. Mr Burns said he accepted the sanction ""unreservedly and without rancour"". In a letter to Prime Minister Boris Johnson after his resignation, he said the recommendation for a suspension made his decision to quit his post ""inevitable"". In February, Mr Burns wrote to a member of the public connected to a company with whom his father was in dispute over the repayment of a loan. He had written: ""I am acutely aware that my role in the public eye could well attract interest especially if I were to use parliamentary privilege to raise the case."" Parliamentary privilege protects MPs from being sued for defamation for speeches made in Parliament. What are the limits to parliamentary free speech? The Committee on Standards concluded Mr Burns had tried to intimidate the member of the public, and it was an abuse of his position as an MP which required a ""sanction more severe than apology"". It added that the dispute related purely to ""private family interests"" and had ""no connection"" with Mr Burns's duties as a Member of Parliament. Apologising to the committee in March, the Conservative MP for Bournemouth West said he should not have written to the member of the public ""in the terms I did"" using Commons-headed notepaper. He said he had been motivated by a desire to resolve the ""long-running"" dispute, which he said had a ""significant"" impact on his father's health. But in its report, the committee accused Mr Burns of being ""driven by a sense of anger which, in our view, has affected his judgement in this matter"". First elected to Parliament in 2010, Mr Burns was made a trade minister by Boris Johnson shortly after the prime minister entered Downing Street in July last year. He was a campaigner for Brexit during the EU referendum in 2016 and was a close friend of former Conservative Prime Minister Lady Thatcher, in her final years. Writing to Mr Burns after his resignation, Mr Johnson thanked him for his ""unstinting loyalty over recent years"" and said he would ""continue to add much from the backbenches"". Separately, another trade minister, Greg Hands, has been ordered to apologise to MPs for sending a Commons-headed letter to around 7,000 constituents in April 2019. The standards committee said the mailshot had breached rules which say MPs should not use Parliamentary stationery to their political advantage. It concluded that the letter, on topics including policing and transport, was ""unlikely"" to have been sent without regard to its ""political impact on potential voters"". It also accused the Conservative MP for Chelsea and Fulham of dragging the process out until after the 2019 general election, after initially offering to resolve the case in October.

Firms rush to secure new lockdown survival loans,"Big UK banks received around 100,000 applications in a single day for a new loan scheme for small businesses. The Bounce Back Loans scheme went live on Monday, with Barclays seeing 200 applications in the first minute and Lloyds 5,000 within three hours. It offers loans up to Â£50,000 and is designed to be simpler and quicker than the existing Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme (CBILS). Barclays said its first bounce back loans will be awarded within 24 hours. CBILS offer loans of up to Â£5m and are available for companies with a turnover of less than Â£45m. However, the loans have come in for criticism by some businesses, especially smaller ones. Banks can often apply their usual lending criteria, which makes it harder for smaller enterprises to qualify while locked down. On Thursday, the number of CBILS loans agreed was 8,638, down from more than 9,000 the previous week. Of 52,807 loans applied for, almost 28,000 have still to be approved. Banks have been criticised for delays in handing out loans but have blamed the heavy workload, the need to complete the necessary credit checks and a shortage of staff. The government insists the new bounce back loans will be easier to apply for. However, UK Finance, which represents banks, emphasised that firms should ""think very carefully before taking on new debt"". Of the UK's largest banks, Lloyds Banking Group said it received the most with 17,000 applications so far, while HSBC received 12,830 and 10,000 applied to NatWest. Barclays said it was ready to approve 6,000. Barclays denied its online system failed, but said that some customers may have to wait. ""Due to the extremely high level of demand, some customers will see availability later on today,"" it said. There are about 5.8 million firms in the UK with fewer than 50 staff While the loans are aimed at smaller businesses and sole traders, with Â£2,000 to Â£50,000 on offer, there is no limit on the size of business that can apply. To qualify, a firm must have been trading on 1 March this year and not have been in financial difficulty. In other words, the loans are not intended to bail out failing businesses. While these are early days, business leaders have been generally positive about the bounce-back scheme. It ""offers real hope"" for small firms, says Mike Cherry, head of the Federation of Small Businesses. Empty High Streets have become symbolic of the crisis facing small traders Businesses should apply through the bank with which they have a business account. The Treasury says funds should then be available ""within days"". Borrowers answer seven questions on an online form including information about turnover, tax details, bank account and how the lockdown and Covid-19 has impacted your business. Applicants do not have to provide security and personal guarantees. Ten banks have been accredited to provide the loans. However, the expectation is that because of the simplicity of the process, banks will transfer the money far quicker than CBIL loans. The lockdown hit just as Rachel Sweet's one-year-old business was entering its busiest trading period. She also had expansion plans. The bounce-back loans could prove a lifeline, she says, and her application has already gone in, via HSBC. Bath-based Sweet Drinks sells, promotes and organises tastings based on produce from the West Country. With the summer season and big outdoor events approaching, ""we were thinking about taking the business to the next level"". She estimates she lost 60% of her business when lockdown effectively closed the events season. Rachel says: ""Given all the hurdles and rejections we were reading about with the business interruption scheme, we decided to wait a little. ""This new scheme looks much more suitable for us. We've got enough money to cover our costs for a while,"" she said. ""We had hoped sales over the next few months would generate enough money to launch a new website and a mail order business."" Six months ago she was thinking of taking out a big bank loan to fund expansion, financing that would have come with a hefty interest rate. That could have made the current situation worse. The stress levels are high, she says. ""But luckily I'm a glass-half-full person, so I'm staying positive and just trying to do my best given the business environment."" The loan application took no time at all, requiring some basic business details, she says. ""It was a very straightforward process. I hope to hear by the end of the week. Fingers crossed."" The government will cover the cost of fees and interest for the first year. Businesses will only begin repaying the loan after 12 months. All lenders will charge a flat rate of 2.5% and the loans will last up to six years. This bounce-back rate is likely to be lower than most CBILS as they are less risky. The government is guaranteeing 100% of the loan from lenders if the firm defaults. With CBILS, the guarantee is 80% of the money. Both the Treasury and banks are keen to emphasise that they are loans that need to be repaid. The tax authorities have promised close inspection of all loans given. Chancellor Rishi Sunak came under strong pressure to introduce loans that were 100% government-backed You can still apply for one of these new loans. You can switch your CBILS application to a bounce back one if it was under Â£50,000. Or, if you already have a CBIL you can convert it, the Treasury says. Applicants do not have to stay with existing lenders. The major High Street banks are currently offering the bulk of the loans, although accreditation could be expanded to include other specialist small business backers and financial firms. Stephen Jones, chief executive of UK Finance, told the BBC the affordability checks would ""be lighter"", but firms should still ""think very carefully about their ability to repay the loan"". Despite the government guarantee, banks are required to first chase firms for money if they do not repay the loan. That means seizing assets and pursuing business owners through the courts. Mr Jones said: ""These are loans, not grants, so if a business is already indebted and taking on further debt, they should think carefully before making an application."" The British Chambers of Commerce has said that about 30% of its members say they cannot afford to take on more debt.

Possible post-lockdown workplace rules revealed,"Protective screens are among alternatives to social distancing suggested in a draft document Reduced hot-desking and alternatives to social distancing where it is not possible are among measures being considered to let workplaces reopen. One of seven draft plans to ease anti-coronavirus restrictions, seen by the BBC, also urges employers to minimise numbers using equipment, stagger shift times and maximise home-working. PM Boris Johnson is to reveal a ""roadmap"" out of lockdown on Sunday. But the UK must not lift restrictions too soon, he said in a video message. In the video,posted on Twitter,external, Mr Johnson said: ""The worst thing we could do now is ease up too soon and allow a second peak of coronavirus."" Mr Johnson said the UK would only be able to move on to ""the second phase of this conflict"" when the government'sfive testshad been met, including a sustained and consistent fall in daily deaths and being confident any adjustments would not risk a second peak which could overwhelm the health service. LIVE: Latest updates from around the world What is a safe distance in social distancing? Wristbands, colour-coding - inventive ways out of lockdown The BBC has seen one of seven draft documents which says additional hygiene procedures, physical screens and the use of protective equipment should be considered where maintaining distancing of 2m (6ft) between workers is impossible. However, the section marked PPE contains only a promise that ""more detail"" will follow. The guidance covers the whole of the UK - but devolved governments have the power to make their own decisions on how businesses get back to work. The other draft documents,which have been seen by BuzzFeed News,external, cover guidance for workplace settings including hotels and restaurants. Under the guidelines bar areas and seated restaurants and cafes must be closed, according to BuzzFeed. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace told BBC Breakfast protective screens, like those used at some supermarket checkouts, PPE and coronavirus testing could be used to make people feel safe in workplaces if it was ""vital"" they worked close to each other. Many companies have been shut since widespread limits on everyday life were imposed on 23 March, in a bid to limit the effects of the virus's spread on the NHS. Ministers are obliged to review those restrictions by Thursday. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said it is ""very likely"" the Scottish government will continue lockdown measures beyond a scheduled review on Thursday. Speaking at her daily briefing, Ms Sturgeon said the infection rate is still too high to make ""any meaningful change"". She added that while work would be done to ensure there is alignment with the rest of the UK, divergence in measures could still be possible. Finnebrogue Artisan, which makes sausages and bacon in Downpatrick, Northern Ireland, has kept operating throughout the pandemic. Director Declan Ferguson told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it was ""totally doable"" for other companies to reopen. He said they had introduced physical markers to keep staff 2m apart, take workers' temperatures when they arrive, and issue them with masks and visors on the factory floor. Doors are kept open wherever possible to reduce the number of things staff need to touch, and social distancing marshals ensure the rules are being followed. It is not yet clear when schools could return to help more parents go back to work. However,the Guardian reports,externalthat government scientific advisers are examining the impact of letting children in their final year of primary school return to classrooms from 1 June, as part of a phased reopening of schools.

The number of coronavirus-related deaths in the UK stands at 28,446 - an increase of 315 on Saturday's figure - with 14,248 people currently being treated in hospital. However, admissions have fallen, along with the number of critical care beds being used. On Monday, a further 204 deaths were announced in England, along with five more in Scotland and 14 more in Wales. The latest UK-wide figures - which use a different timeframe to those of individual nations - will be published later. The prime minister will examine data, take advice on how much the virus has been suppressed and assess the potential consequences on infection rates of changes to rules, before setting out plans next Sunday. Responses received last night to the draft workplace guidelines from companies, business groups and unions will also be taken into account. Rail unions have written to Boris Johnsonexpressing concerns about plans by operators to increase the number of trains in service as more people potentially return to work. ""We will not accept new working patterns that put the lives of railway workers and passengers at risk,"" says the joint letter from ASLEF, RMT and TSSA. London's NHS Nightingale was built in just nine days Meanwhile, London's NHS Nightingale hospitalis expected to take no new patients and be placed on standby in the coming days. The ExCel Centre was turned into a 4,000-bed facility to increase the NHS's capacity for treating patients with Covid-19. In a briefing to staff, the hospital's chief executive said it was ""likely"" the hospital would not need to admit patients in the coming days while the virus remained under control in London.

'Huge gaps' in draft post-lockdown workplace rules,"Draft guidance for getting people back to work during the coronavirus pandemic could compromise worker safety, the head of the TUC has warned. Frances O'Grady, who leads the group representing UK unions, said it cannot back the advice in its ""current form"". She said there were ""huge gaps"" over protective kit and testing. Reduced hot-desking and alternatives to social distancing where it is not possible are among measures being considered by the government. The document, seen by the BBC, is one of seven draft plans to ease anti-virus restrictions. It also urges employers to minimise numbers using equipment, stagger shift times and maximise home-working. The guidance covers the whole of the UK - but the devolved governments have the power to make their own decisions on how businesses can get back to work. LIVE: Latest updates from around the world How many confirmed cases are there in your area? Wristbands, colour-coding - inventive ways out of lockdown What is the UK's new contact tracing plan? Meanwhile, the number of coronavirus-related deaths in the UK stands at 28,734, an increase of 288, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said at the Downing Street briefing. The health secretary outlined the coronavirus contact-tracing app at the Downing Street briefing The daily increase in deaths is lower than at any point since the end of March, but the figures reported at the weekend tend to be lower and are expected to rise, Mr Hancock said. A total of 13,258 people are currently being treated in hospital, while 85,186 coronavirus tests took place on Sunday. However, hospital admissions have fallen, along with the number of critical care beds being used. A coronavirus contact-tracing app aimed at limiting a second wave of coronavirus willbe trialled on the Isle of Wight this week, before being rolled out more widely in the UK, as part of the government's test, track and trace effort. Mr Hancock said creating the system was a ""huge national undertaking"" and would allow the UK to take a ""more targeted approach to lockdown while still safely containing the disease"". A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself?

TESTING:Can I get tested for coronavirus? Buzzfeed has seenall seven draft documents,externalon getting people back to work. Ms O'Grady said the Trades Union Congress had seen some of the documents on Sunday. She said workers' safety must not be compromised and called for ""robust direction and enforcement"" so employers can ""do the right thing"" and action can be taken against those who do not. Frances O'Grady is general secretary of the TUC which represents many UK trade unions She told BBC Radio 4's The World at One: ""The problem is the government is asking us to trust to employer discretion, use words like 'consider social distancing', 'consider having hand sanitiser or soap available', and frankly that's just not good enough."" Asked whether the government's current advice will compromise worker safety, Ms O'Grady said No 10 has time to ""get this right"" and it should work with unions to ensure ""a proper job"" and ""not a botched job"". According to one of the seven draft documents seen by the BBC, firms are told to enact additional hygiene procedures, as well as physical screens, and protective equipment should be considered where maintaining distancing of 2m (6ft) between workers is impossible. However, the section marked personal protective equipment (PPE) contains only a promise that ""more detail"" will follow. During the Downing Street briefing, BBC health editor Hugh Pym asked where those businesses required to have PPE for their staff would source it, and whether they would be in competition with the NHS. Mr Hancock said the ""first call"" on PPE must be for NHS and social care staff, as well as those ""essential services who need it to keep the people delivering those services safe"". He reiterated PPE was one of the government's five tests for adjusting the lockdown. The BBC has also seen a second document with advice for the hospitality industry, which says bar areas, seated restaurants and cafe areas must be closed, with all food and drink outlets serving takeaway food only. It adds hotels should consider ""room occupancy levels to maintain social distancing, especially in multi-occupancy dormitories"". It also says ""guidance to follow"" on the use of PPE and face masks. Some of the other guidance featured in the document includes: Allowing access to as few people as possible into kitchens Spacing workstations 2m apart as much as possible Minimising contact between kitchen and food preparation workers and delivery drivers or riders for example by having zones from which delivery drivers can collect packaged food items Using front of house staff to serve customers in walk-in takeaways, with tills 2m away from the kitchen and ideally separated by a wall or partition Creating a physical barrier, such as a screen, between front of house workers and customers where possible Asking customers to order online, on apps or over the telephone to reduce queues and stagger pick-up times Providing handwashing and hand sanitisers and encourage visitors to wash their hands regularly Considering room occupancy levels to maintain social distancing, especially in multi-occupancy dormitories.

"Love Island summer series cancelled, ITV confirms","Amber Gill, Tommy Fury and Molly-Mae Hague starred in the 2019 series of Love Island Love Island will not broadcast a summer series this year due to the coronavirus pandemic. The reality show will instead return in 2021, ITV confirmed on Monday. Kevin Lygo, director of television at ITV said: ""We have tried every which way to make Love Island this summer. ""But logistically it's just not possible to produce it in a way that safeguards the wellbeing of everyone involved and that for us is the priority."" Gaslighting to girl code: How Love Island reflects society Amber and Greg crowned winners of Love Island 2019 He added: ""In normal circumstances we would be preparing very soon to travel out to the location in Mallorca to get the villa ready but clearly that's now out of the question. ""We are very sorry for fans of the show but making it safely is our prime concern and Love Island will be back stronger than ever in 2021. In the meantime Love Island fans can still enjoy all six series of Love Island on BritBox."" The cancellation of this year's summer edition of Love Island will be a big disappointment to its viewers. The programme is TV's most popular show for younger adults. The loss of that audience will also be a huge financial blow to ITV. The show's ability to deliver those younger viewers has made it immensely valuable to advertisers. And that financial loss, estimated at tens of millions of pounds, will extend to the other lucrative deals it usually strikes with around a dozen other commercial partners for everything from programme sponsorship to product placement. But perhaps the most significant impact will be the loss of such a popular piece of escapism at a time that many will feel that they need it the most. Love Island is the most successful programme in ITV2's history. More thansix million viewers watched the launchof last summer's series, which was eventually won by Amber Gill and Greg O'Shea. Paige Turley and Finley Tapp won the first winter series of Love Island earlier this year The dating show sees contestants secluded in a villa in Spain, hoping to find romance. The winning couple receives Â£50,000. The show, a revival of an earlier series of the same name which aired for two series back in 2005 and 2006, has been broadcast every summer since 2015. Earlier this year it launched an additional winter series, which was won by Finley Tapp and Paige Turley. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Coronavirus: 'Missing link' species may never be foundThe ""intermediate host"" animal that passed the coronavirus from bats to humans may never be found, say scientists.Science & Environment","A number of early cases in the pandemic were linked to the Wuhan Seafood Market It was a matter of ""when not if"" an animal passed the coronavirus from wild bats to humans, scientists say. But it remains unclear whether that animal was sold in the now infamous Wuhan wildlife market in China. The World Health Organization says that all evidence points to the virus's natural origin, but some scientists now say it might never be known how the first person was infected. Trade in wild animals is under scrutiny as source of this ""spillover"". But when wildlife is bought and sold in almost every country in the world, controlling it - let alone banning it - is far from straightforward. Tackling it on a global scale could be the route to stopping a future pandemic before it starts. Is there any evidence for coronavirus lab release idea? The race to find the source of coronavirus in wildlife Coronavirus: 'Pets no risk to owners' vets stress The virus originated in bats and was probably passed to humans via an 'intermediate host' Global health researchers have, for many years, understood how the trade in wild animals provides a source of species-to-species disease transmission. As life-changing as this particular outbreak has been for so much of the global population, it is actually one of many that the trade has been linked to. As the WHO's technical lead on Covid-19, Dr Maria Van Kerkhove, told the BBC: ""We were preparing for something like this as it's not a matter of if, it is a matter of when."" Infectious disease experts agree that, like most emerging human disease, this virus initially jumped undetected across the species barrier. Prof Andrew Cunningham, from the Zoological Society of London, explained: ""We've actually been expecting something like this to happen for a while. ""These diseases are emerging more frequently in recent years as a result of human encroachment into wild habitat and increased contact and use of wild animals by people."" Officials seize civet cats in Xinyuan wildlife market in Guangzhou to prevent the spread of Sars The virus that causes Covid-19 joins a murky list of household name viruses - including Ebola, rabies, Sars and Mers - that have originated in wild bat populations. Some of the now extensive body of evidence about bat viruses, and their ability to infect humans, comes from seeking the source of the 2003 outbreak of Sars, a very closely related coronavirus.It was only in 2017 though that scientists pinned down the ""rich gene pool of bat Sars-related coronaviruses"" in a single cave in China.,external- the possible source of the pandemic. These viruses have resided in the bodies of bats for millennia, but are pre-programmed with the ability to infect a humans; the key that unlocks some of our cells, where they can replicate. ""In the case of Sars-CoV-2 the key is a virus protein called Spike and the main lock to enter a cell is a receptor called ACE2,"" explained Prof David Robertson, a virologist from the University of Glasgow. ""The coronavirus is not only able to fit that ACE2 lock, ""it's actually doing this many times better than Sars-1 [the virus that caused the 2003 outbreak] does"", he said. Coronaviruses under the microscope That perfect fit could explain why the coronavirus is so easily transmitted from person to person; its contagiousness has outpaced our efforts to contain it. But bringing the bat virus to the door of a human cell is where the trade in wildlife plays an important role. Most of us have heard that this virus ""started"" in a wildlife market in Wuhan. But the source of the virus - an animal with this pathogen in its body - was not found in the market. ""The initial cluster of infections was associated with the market - that is circumstantial evidence,"" explained Prof James Wood from the University of Cambridge. ""The infection could have come from somewhere else and just, by chance, clustered around people there. But given that it is an animal virus, the market association is highly suggestive."" Prof Cunningham agreed; wildlife markets, he explained, are hotspots for animal diseases to find new hosts. ""Mixing large numbers of species under poor hygienic and welfare conditions, and species that wouldn't normally come close together gives opportunities for pathogens to jump species to species,"" he explained. Animals rescued from the exotic pet trade often have to be protected from human disease Many wildlife viruses in the past have come into humans via a second species - one that is farmed, or hunted and sold on a market. Prof Woods explained: ""The original Sars virus was transmitted into the human population via an epidemic in Palm civets, which were being traded around southern China to be eaten. ""That was very important to know because there was an epidemic in the Palm civets themselves, which had to be controlled to stop an ongoing spillover into humans."" In the search for the missing link in this particular transmission chain, scientists found clues pointing to mink, ferrets and even turtles as a host.Similar viruses were found in the bodies of rare and widely trafficked pangolins, but none of these suspect species has been shown to be involved in this outbreak. What we do know is that our contact with, and trading of, wild animals puts us in the path of new diseases that are silently seeking a host. Camels can harbour the novel coronavirus, Mers ""Trying to make sure that we are not bringing wildlife into direct contact with ourselves or with other domestic animals is a very important part of this equation,"" said Prof Wood. ""And there have been various campaigns to ban all trade in animals and all contact with wildlife,"" he added, ""but what you do then is penalise some of the poorest people in the world. In many cases, by introducing measures like that you drive trade underground, which makes it far harder to do anything about."" The WHO has already called for stricter hygiene and safety standards for so-called wet markets in China. But in many cases - such as the trade in bush meat in Sub-Saharan Africa, which was linked with the Ebola outbreak - markets are informal and therefore very difficult to regulate. ""You can't do it from an office in London or in Geneva; you have to do that locally on the ground in every country,"" added Prof Wood. Dr Maria Van Kerkhove agreed: ""It's very important we work with population and people who are working at the animal/human interface - people who work with wildlife."" What that will be is a truly global and highly complicated effort. But the Covid-19 outbreak appears to have shown us the cost of the alternative.

Resident Val Shadrick said she put out a call on Facebook for locals to make the effigies to keep the village entertained. Ms Shadrick said she expected about 30 to be put up, but more than 150 have appeared. She said initially she thought making the straw sentinels would be ""something that the children and bigger kids could get involved with, should they be bored"" as well as livening up the villager's daily walks. But as more and more people got involved, Ms Shadrick said it had reached the point where she'd coined the phrase ""scarecrow-navirus"". An 11-year-old girl has turned her sewing skills to making face masks, raising money for a food bank. Matilda, from Lancaster, was due to see Mamma Mia! at the theatre and had started work sewing an Abba costume when schools were closed.

"World must 'pull together' to back vaccine, PM says","Scientists in Beijing carrying out one of dozens of research projects into potential vaccines More than $8bn (Â£6.5bn) has been pledged to help develop a coronavirus vaccine and fund research into the diagnosis and treatment of the disease. Some 40 countries and donors took part in an online summit hosted by the EU. EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the money would help kickstart unprecedented global co-operation. She said it showed the true value of unity and humanity, but warned much more would be needed in the days ahead. In total, more than 30 countries, along with UN and philanthropic bodies and research institutes, made donations. Donors also included pop singer Madonna, who pledged â¬1m ($1.1m), said Ms von der Leyen, who set outthe Brussels-led initiative,externalon Friday. The European Commission pledged $1bn to fund research on a vaccine.  Norway matched the European Commission's contribution, and France has pledged â¬500m, as have Saudi Arabia and Germany.  Japan pledged more than $800m. The US and Russia did not take part.  China, where the virus originated in December, was represented by its ambassador to the European Union. Of the money raised, $4.4bn will go on vaccine development, some $2bn on the search for a treatment and $1.6bn for producing tests, the EU said. In her opening remarks at the summit, Ms von der Leyen said everyone must chip in to finance ""a truly global endeavour"". ""I believe 4 May will mark a turning point in our fight against coronavirus because today the world is coming together,"" she said. ""The partners are many, the goal is one: to defeat this virus."" UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, another co-host of the conference, said the ""more we pull together"" in sharing expertise, ""the faster our scientists will succeed"" in developing a vaccine. Mr Johnson, who spent three nights in intensive care with Covid-19, was to confirm the UK's pledge of Â£388m for vaccine research, testing and treatment during the conference. Along with the European Commission, the conference is being co-hosted by the UK, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Norway and Saudi Arabia. Emmanuel Macron and Angela Merkel, pictured last year, are among the world leaders who signed the letter Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel are also among those who have signed up to the initiative. In the open letter published in weekend newspapers, the leaders said the funds raised would ""kickstart an unprecedented global co-operation between scientists and regulators, industry and governments, international organisations, foundations and healthcare professionals"". ""If we can develop a vaccine that is produced by the world, for the whole world, this will be a unique global public good of the 21st Century,"" they added.

The UN says a return to normal life will only be possible with a vaccine. Dozens of research projects trying to find a vaccine are currently under way across the world. Even with more financial commitment, it will take time to know which ones might work and how well.

Online students would still face full tuition feesIf universities are teaching online next term students will still have to pay full tuition fees.,"Universities have warned of financial collapse if some institutions cannot recruit enough students this year University students in England will still have to pay full tuition fees even if their courses are taught online in the autumn, the government has said. ""We don't believe students will be entitled to reimbursement if the quality is there,"" universities minister Michelle Donelan said. But the university sector's request for a Â£2bn bail-out has been rejected. Universities had warned of financial danger from a reduction in overseas students because of coronavirus. University campuses have been closed by the pandemic - and there is uncertainty for students whether there will be in-person teaching in the autumn or whether courses will be taught fully or partly online. The universities minister said no formal decision had been taken on the next academic year, but if courses are taught online and ""students are really getting the quality, and they're getting a course which is fit for purpose"", they would not get a discount on fees. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise HOW A VIRUS SPREADS:An explanation LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area TESTING:Can I get tested for coronavirus? ""Universities are still continuing with their overheads and their expenses during this time, and it's no fault of their own,"" she said. If students were not getting adequate teaching online, she said there were processes for them to complain. Jake, an accountancy student in Leeds, told the BBC that charging full fees for online courses was so unfair that it made him want to drop out. ""There has clearly been no consideration of students with this decision. I pay tuition fees to go to my university in person, to be taught at my university in person, to access the facilities of the university - libraries, societies, sports facilities - in person. ""Expecting students to pay full fees for a service that they aren't receiving is frankly insulting,"" he said. Rose, an international student from India studying in Manchester, said getting lessons online was not an adequate alternative - and regretted paying so much for her course. ""It's been a nightmare. First of all we had two strikes which lasted three to four weeks at a time and now this. ""I paid Â£19,000 for my course. We're not a rich family. That's all the money my family have. I feel so guilty for using it all up for this."" Isobel, another student in Manchester, contacted the BBC to say: ""There has been no talk about a refund for the lack of lectures. ""I am finding it difficult not being able to access libraries, and ask questions. Yes, I know you can email stuff to lecturers but they're swamped."" An unimpressed student, Livi, posted on Twitter: ""So by September I'll have lost almost Â£3,000 to rent a house I'm not even living in, and tuition fees will still be max even if it's online - something about this seems unfair."" Tom Kendall, a member of the UK Youth Parliament, said: ""If we have to stay home and complete online lectures what about the students who are less fortunate and don't have a laptop or access to wi-fi?"" As well as weighing up whether they want to study online, applicants will be waiting for information on how a reopened campus might function, in terms of social distancing, social activities and student accommodation. The National Union of Students has highlighted how difficult it can be for current students to study online, with some struggling with a lack of computer equipment and broadband access and not having enough space in which to work. What would a university experience be like with social distancing? A study from the Sutton Trust suggests some applicants are reconsidering their university plans, in a year group that has already seen exams cancelled and replaced by estimated grades. There is a ""huge degree of worry and uncertainty,"" says trust founder, Sir Peter Lampl. There are particular financial worries for universities about an expected drop in overseas students, who pay a higher level of fees. Last month, Universities UK called for at least Â£2bn inemergency funding, saying that otherwise some institutions could go bust. Ms Donelan has announced measures to stabilise university finances, but without the extra cash requested. To help with cash flow, Â£2.6bn of tuition fee income and Â£100m of research funding will be brought forward and universities will be able to access the Treasury's support for businesses disrupted by coronavirus, worth another Â£700m. ""Should providers require further support the government will continue to review their financial circumstances,"" said the universities minister. There will also be more flexibility in the clearing system, which matches applicants to empty places after results are issued. Universities have been worried about ""volatility"" in applications and that some universities could be so short of recruits they would be financially unviable. Students angry at having to pay rent on empty rooms Universities warn of going bust without emergency funds University admissions could face student number controls To stop such fluctuations, there will be controls on student numbers, designed to stop some universities adding many more students, while others could be be left with too few. The higher education watchdog, the Office for Students, said it would impose financial penalties on universities using pressure selling tactics ""to increase student intake beyond normal levels"". The Russell Group of leading universities said the ""big remaining challenge"" was funding for research. ""Universities face significant shortfalls in international students and other sources of income that we need to underpin vital work that otherwise goes under-funded,"" said chief executive, Tim Bradshaw. Universities UK said the stability measures were a recognition of the important part universities would play in the ""recovery of the economy and communities"" in the wake of the pandemic and the ""severe financial storm"" it had created. The universities body has said that in the forthcoming weeks current students and applicants will be given a clearer idea of arrangements for opening in the autumn.

"Love Island 2020 series cancelled, ITV confirms","Amber Gill, Tommy Fury and Molly-Mae Hague starred in the 2019 series of Love Island Love Island will not broadcast a summer series this year due to the coronavirus pandemic. The reality show will instead return in 2021, ITV confirmed on Monday. Kevin Lygo, director of television at ITV said: ""We have tried every which way to make Love Island this summer. ""But logistically it's just not possible to produce it in a way that safeguards the wellbeing of everyone involved and that for us is the priority."" Gaslighting to girl code: How Love Island reflects society Amber and Greg crowned winners of Love Island 2019 He added: ""In normal circumstances we would be preparing very soon to travel out to the location in Mallorca to get the villa ready but clearly that's now out of the question. ""We are very sorry for fans of the show but making it safely is our prime concern and Love Island will be back stronger than ever in 2021. In the meantime Love Island fans can still enjoy all six series of Love Island on BritBox."" The cancellation of this year's summer edition of Love Island will be a big disappointment to its viewers. The programme is TV's most popular show for younger adults. The loss of that audience will also be a huge financial blow to ITV. The show's ability to deliver those younger viewers has made it immensely valuable to advertisers. And that financial loss, estimated at tens of millions of pounds, will extend to the other lucrative deals it usually strikes with around a dozen other commercial partners for everything from programme sponsorship to product placement. But perhaps the most significant impact will be the loss of such a popular piece of escapism at a time that many will feel that they need it the most. Love Island is the most successful programme in ITV2's history. More thansix million viewers watched the launchof last summer's series, which was eventually won by Amber Gill and Greg O'Shea. Paige Turley and Finley Tapp won the first winter series of Love Island earlier this year The dating show sees contestants secluded in a villa in Spain, hoping to find romance. The winning couple receives Â£50,000. The show, a revival of an earlier series of the same name which aired for two series back in 2005 and 2006, has been broadcast every summer since 2015. Earlier this year it launched an additional winter series, which was won by Finley Tapp and Paige Turley. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Minister resigns after probe into letter,"Conor Burns with Boris Johnson at the 2018 Tory conference Conor Burns has resigned as a trade minister after a report found he used his position as an MP to intimidate a member of the public. TheCommons standards watchdog,externalsaid he made ""veiled threats"" to use parliamentary privilege to ""further his family's interests"" in a financial dispute involving his father. It had called for him to be suspended from Parliament for seven days. Mr Burns said he accepted the sanction ""unreservedly and without rancour"". In a letter to Prime Minister Boris Johnson after his resignation, he said the recommendation for a suspension made his decision to quit his post ""inevitable"". In February, Mr Burns wrote to a member of the public connected to a company with whom his father was in dispute over the repayment of a loan.

Parliamentary privilege protects MPs from being sued for defamation for speeches made in Parliament. What are the limits to parliamentary free speech? The Committee on Standards concluded Mr Burns had tried to intimidate the member of the public, and it was an abuse of his position as an MP which required a ""sanction more severe than apology"". It added that the dispute related purely to ""private family interests"" and had ""no connection"" with Mr Burns's duties as a Member of Parliament. Apologising to the committee in March, the Conservative MP for Bournemouth West said he should not have written to the member of the public ""in the terms I did"" using Commons-headed notepaper. He said he had been motivated by a desire to resolve the ""long-running"" dispute, which he said had a ""significant"" impact on his father's health. But in its report, the committee accused Mr Burns of being ""driven by a sense of anger which, in our view, has affected his judgement in this matter"". First elected to Parliament in 2010, Mr Burns was made a trade minister by Boris Johnson shortly after the prime minister entered Downing Street in July last year. He was a campaigner for Brexit during the EU referendum in 2016 and was a close friend of former Conservative Prime Minister Lady Thatcher, in her final years. Writing to Mr Burns after his resignation, Mr Johnson thanked him for his ""unstinting loyalty over recent years"" and said he would ""continue to add much from the backbenches"".

The standards committee said the mailshot had breached rules which say MPs should not use Parliamentary stationery to their political advantage. It concluded that the letter, on topics including policing and transport, was ""unlikely"" to have been sent without regard to its ""political impact on potential voters"".

"Love Island cancels 2020 seriesThe ITV2 reality show will not go ahead with this summer's series, but it will return in 2021.Entertainment & Arts","Amber Gill, Tommy Fury and Molly-Mae Hague starred in the 2019 series of Love Island Love Island will not broadcast a summer series this year due to the coronavirus pandemic. The reality show will instead return in 2021, ITV confirmed on Monday. Kevin Lygo, director of television at ITV said: ""We have tried every which way to make Love Island this summer. ""But logistically it's just not possible to produce it in a way that safeguards the wellbeing of everyone involved and that for us is the priority."" Gaslighting to girl code: How Love Island reflects society Amber and Greg crowned winners of Love Island 2019 He added: ""In normal circumstances we would be preparing very soon to travel out to the location in Mallorca to get the villa ready but clearly that's now out of the question. ""We are very sorry for fans of the show but making it safely is our prime concern and Love Island will be back stronger than ever in 2021. In the meantime Love Island fans can still enjoy all six series of Love Island on BritBox."" The cancellation of this year's summer edition of Love Island will be a big disappointment to its viewers. The programme is TV's most popular show for younger adults. The loss of that audience will also be a huge financial blow to ITV. The show's ability to deliver those younger viewers has made it immensely valuable to advertisers. And that financial loss, estimated at tens of millions of pounds, will extend to the other lucrative deals it usually strikes with around a dozen other commercial partners for everything from programme sponsorship to product placement. But perhaps the most significant impact will be the loss of such a popular piece of escapism at a time that many will feel that they need it the most. Love Island is the most successful programme in ITV2's history. More thansix million viewers watched the launchof last summer's series, which was eventually won by Amber Gill and Greg O'Shea. Paige Turley and Finley Tapp won the first winter series of Love Island earlier this year The dating show sees contestants secluded in a villa in Spain, hoping to find romance. The winning couple receives Â£50,000. The show, a revival of an earlier series of the same name which aired for two series back in 2005 and 2006, has been broadcast every summer since 2015. Earlier this year it launched an additional winter series, which was won by Finley Tapp and Paige Turley. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

BBC Radio Cornwall Politicians, police, postal workers and paramedics...are just a few of the key workers on show in scarecrow form around the village of Kilkhampton in Cornwall. Resident Val Shadrick said she put out a call on Facebook for locals to make the effigies to keep the village entertained. Ms Shadrick said she expected about 30 to be put up, but more than 150 have appeared. She said initially she thought making the straw sentinels would be ""something that the children and bigger kids could get involved with, should they be bored"" as well as livening up the villager's daily walks. But as more and more people got involved, Ms Shadrick said it had reached the point where she'd coined the phrase ""scarecrow-navirus"". An 11-year-old girl has turned her sewing skills to making face masks, raising money for a food bank.

Here's a reminder of today's developments in Wales:  We'll be back on Tuesday morning to bring you the latest on coronavirus throughout Wales. Welsh politicians have held
discussions with General Electric about the future of its south Wales plant after
the company announced plans to cut 13,000 jobs globally. Mick Antoniw, the Welsh Assembly member for Pontypridd, said the company
would be looking for voluntary redundancies at the Nantgarw site, rather than
compulsory ones, and will also safeguard its apprenticeship scheme GE had been forced to take action
because of the ""unique economic circumstances"" facing it, with the
air industry in particular suffering a ""massive impact"" from
coronavirus, Mr Antoniw said. ""It could be a lot worse because,
at the moment, three-quarters of the air industry is shut down,"" he added. GE said on Monday it was planning to
cut 25% of its worldwide workforce as part of $3bn savings.  It employs about 1,400 people at Nantgarw. The mounting woes for the aviation sector
are now expected to last into 2021 following a dramatic fall in passenger air
travel demand. Pontypridd MP Alex Davies-Jones said:

Glastonbarry festival has been cancelled due to the ongoing situation surrounding the Covid-19 outbreak.

Organisers Mack Events said: ""The priority must be the health and safety of our customers, event staff, volunteers and the wider public.""

The Welsh Government wants a system of surveillance to help ease Wales out of lockdown. But a Public Health Wales plan has revealed the potential scale of the task ahead. Plaid Cymru said the document contains ""as many questions as answers"". The Welsh Government was asked for comment. The report says the contact tracing operation will be led by 94 teamsspread across the country, with each team responsible for an area with a population of roughly 30,000. A total workforce of between 1,400 and 1,600 full-time employees will be needed across the country, seven days per week.

Five things you need to knowabout the coronavirus outbreak this evening. The Evening Standard asks whether those recovered from Covid-19 are expected to catch the virus again, and for an update on the development of antibody tests. Matt Hancock says the automatic response tests the government looked into had not been effective enough, but were able to be used for surveys. He says the government will get estimates ""soon"" of the proportion of the population who have antibodies. Hancock says he is taking part in regular testing for antibodies and to monitor if he gets the virus again. England's deputy chief medical officer Jonathan Van Tam says there are suggestions that those who have tested positive for coronavirus do develop antibodies. On whether this will protect from further infections, he says the disease has not been around long enough ""to know the answers with any surety"". Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Plenty of questions about contact tracing at Monday's briefing. This is understandable - it will be crucial in helping UK to move out of lockdown. If people are going to be able to return to some level of normality, there needs to be a way of quickly identifying new infections and preventing them becoming major outbreaks. The increase in testing that has been seen is part of this. But so is finding the people who have had close contact with the infected person. To do that, the government is piloting an app in the Isle of Wight that will alert users if they are one of those close contacts. A team of contact tracers will also be put in place to manually trace people because not everyone will sign up for the app. But some element of social distancing and shielding the vulnerable will still be needed in a post-lockdown world. A journalist from the Isle of Wight asks why the island has been chosen for the trial of the NHS Covid-19 tracing app. Health Secretary Matt Hancock says the elderly population on the island - and projected lower number of smartphone users - was a factor in choosing it. He says this means the trial will therefore address ""as many of the challenges"" as possible in rolling out the app nationwide. John Newton, the UK governmentâs testing co-ordinator, says that relatively restricted travel to the island makes it an ""ideal place"" to study the spread of a virus. Health Secretary Matt Hancock says the UK government hopes to roll out its contact tracing programme across the nation in the ""middle of this month"". Asked how many of the 18,000 tracers had so far been recruited, he says ""thousands"" have joined but does not give a precise figure. He says the 18,000 target is only an ""initial goal"" and could be modified if new data shows it is justified. An ITV reporter points out that the most successful contact tracing efforts have been reliant on volunteers to track down cases, and asks whether this capacity is in place in the UK. Mr Hancock says he agrees it is not ""just about the technology"" but also about ""citizens acting in the right way"" - like downloading the app - but he doesn't answer the question directly. The body which represents trade unions in Wales has said that there needs to be a ""gradual"" and ""sectoral approach"" to reopening the economy. Shavanah Taj, general secretary of the Wales Trades Union Congress (TUC) told BBC Wales that it would not be possible for everything to be reopened at once âwith no real plan and no staggered approachâ. She added that employers will need to conduct ""appropriate risk assessments"" to protect specific groups and specific people when returning to work and ""ensure that they work in practice"". Earlier today, First Minister, Mark Drakeford said that employers in Wales were in a ""better position"" because rules requiring firms to allow two metres between employees had already been introduced in Wales. However, Ms Taj said the Wales TUC continues to receive ""a number"" of complaints about the observance of social distancing at workplaces. In response to another question from a member of the public on the aim of ""test, track and trace"" app, Health Secretary Matt Hancock says it will ""help us to keep the R number down"", referring to the rate of infection. But he added that the primary goal was to ""keep the number of new infections down"". ""Our goal is not simply to flatten the curve - it is to get the occurrence of infections very low,"" Mr Hancock says. Taking a question from the member of the public about support for people from ethnic minorities, Health Secretary Matt Hancock agreed the number of deaths in this group had been ""disproportionately high,"" particularly among NHS workers. Professor Jonathan Van Tam says the matter is being taken ""incredibly seriously,"" pledging: ""We will get to the bottom of this."" But it is a ""complicated picture"", he argues, as the effect of other factors such as age, deprivation and underlying conditions on the data will need to be understood. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Lots of positive signs in the latest figures released by the government. Another 288 deaths have been announced - the lowest 24-hour toll reported in a month. Reporting numbers do fall at the weekend - these figures relate to Sunday - but England's deputy chief medical officer Jonathan Van Tam says it is ânow very clear we are past the peakâ. When you look at hospital deaths by date, that peak seems to have happened in the second week of April. The numbers are now around a third of what they were then. Numbers in hospital are down as well - to below 14,000, down from over 20,000 at the peak. A coronavirus patient has said he was ""brought back from the brink of death"" after eight weeks in hospital. Scott Howell, 48, from Wyllie, near Blackwood, was the first Covid-19 patient in the intensive care unit at the Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport in March. The civil servant, who has diabetes and asthma, initially became ill with pneumonia in early March, but things took a drastic turn for the worse after it spread to both lungs. He was put into an induced coma for more than two weeks during whichhis heart stopped - twice. It was only when he later read the his medical notes that he realised just how close he came to dying. A video of Scott being clapped by NHS staff as he left hospital on Thursday has been watched more than 235,000 times on social media. ""They brought me back from the brink of death. They are wonderful, fantastic people and I'll remember them forever,"" he said. Health Secretary Matt Hancock says the NHS ""track and trace"" app for Covid-19 being trialled on the Isle of Wight will take âfull consideration"" of privacy concerns raised in connection with the scheme. He says ""proximity information"" will be logged securely on people's mobile phones, and adds that the Bluetooth signal used to register people's interactions is designed to conserve battery life. Tweaking the now-familiar slogan, Hancock urges Isle of Wight residents to ""stay at home, install the app, protect the NHS and save lives"". A doctor, a vicar and a lawyer who all did amateur dramatics in their youth are among those who have relived those days  by performing an extract of Dylan Thomas's Under Milk Wood online. Key workers were among those taking part alongside stars including actor Michael Sheen, comedian Lloyd Langford and writer/producer Russell T Davies in a YouTube tribute to the power of the arts. All involved had been members of the Swansea-based West Glamorgan Youth Theatre Company, founded in 1975. Allow YouTube content? This article contains content provided by Google YouTube.

Russell T Davies, BAFTA-winning writer Health Secretary Matt Hancock says the UK is now in a position to carry out a ""test, track and trace"" programme to identify and track those with symptoms, adding that a trial of the scheme will start on the Isle of Wight on Tuesday. An NHS app used in the scheme is already being trialled on the island. Mr Hancock says all residents will be asked to download it. He says the programme will allow the government to take a ""more targeted"" approach to the lockdown while containing the virus. Â© 2025 BBC.

"World must 'pull together' to back vaccineWorld leaders sign up to a fundraising drive, which aims to raise $8.3bn over the next month.Europe","Scientists in Beijing carrying out one of dozens of research projects into potential vaccines More than $8bn (Â£6.5bn) has been pledged to help develop a coronavirus vaccine and fund research into the diagnosis and treatment of the disease. Some 40 countries and donors took part in an online summit hosted by the EU. EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the money would help kickstart unprecedented global co-operation. She said it showed the true value of unity and humanity, but warned much more would be needed in the days ahead. In total, more than 30 countries, along with UN and philanthropic bodies and research institutes, made donations. Donors also included pop singer Madonna, who pledged â¬1m ($1.1m), said Ms von der Leyen, who set outthe Brussels-led initiative,externalon Friday. The European Commission pledged $1bn to fund research on a vaccine.  Norway matched the European Commission's contribution, and France has pledged â¬500m, as have Saudi Arabia and Germany.  Japan pledged more than $800m. The US and Russia did not take part.  China, where the virus originated in December, was represented by its ambassador to the European Union. Of the money raised, $4.4bn will go on vaccine development, some $2bn on the search for a treatment and $1.6bn for producing tests, the EU said. In her opening remarks at the summit, Ms von der Leyen said everyone must chip in to finance ""a truly global endeavour"". ""I believe 4 May will mark a turning point in our fight against coronavirus because today the world is coming together,"" she said. ""The partners are many, the goal is one: to defeat this virus."" UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, another co-host of the conference, said the ""more we pull together"" in sharing expertise, ""the faster our scientists will succeed"" in developing a vaccine. Mr Johnson, who spent three nights in intensive care with Covid-19, was to confirm the UK's pledge of Â£388m for vaccine research, testing and treatment during the conference. Along with the European Commission, the conference is being co-hosted by the UK, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Norway and Saudi Arabia. Emmanuel Macron and Angela Merkel, pictured last year, are among the world leaders who signed the letter Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel are also among those who have signed up to the initiative. In the open letter published in weekend newspapers, the leaders said the funds raised would ""kickstart an unprecedented global co-operation between scientists and regulators, industry and governments, international organisations, foundations and healthcare professionals"". ""If we can develop a vaccine that is produced by the world, for the whole world, this will be a unique global public good of the 21st Century,"" they added. At the same time, the signatories gave their backing to the World Health Organization in the face of US criticism of its handling of the outbreak. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? VACCINE:How close are we to finding one? HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area TESTING:Can I get tested for coronavirus? The UN says a return to normal life will only be possible with a vaccine. Dozens of research projects trying to find a vaccine are currently under way across the world. Even with more financial commitment, it will take time to know which ones might work and how well. Most experts think it could take until mid-2021, about 12-18 months after the new virus first emerged, for a vaccine to become available.

With more than one million cases, the US has the highest number of confirmed infections in the world. The country has also recorded more than 68,000 deaths - and on MondayPresident Trump warned that the death toll may reach 100,000. New York State remains the epicentre, as shown in the chart below. View that and more charts tracking the global pandemic in thelatest guide from BBC News' Visual and Data Journalism Team. Cagil KasapogluBBC News, Turkish Turkey's coronavirus containment restrictions will be eased by mid-May, including reopening of shopping centres, hair saloons and some stores, President Tayyip Erdogan said on Monday. Turkey has been imposing blanket curfews over the last few weekends in 31 cities. Over-65s will be allowed to go out ""only within walking distance"" for a few hours a day from 10 May. Similar rules will apply to children. Erdogan said shopping malls, barber shops and some stores will be allowed to reopen on 11 May. Universities will return on 15 June. But Erdogan warned that much stricter measures would be put in place if the public does not abide by the rules. âThis normalisation plan does not mean weâll be back to our days as of the first days of March,â he said. According to Turkeyâs Ministry of Health, the death toll in the country has risen to 3,461. The National Rifle Association (NRA) - the largest pro-gun lobbying group in the US - has furloughed workers (given them temporary leave) and cut salaries due to the coronavirus pandemic. The group's annual convention - which probably would have drawn a visit from President Trump - has also been cancelled. ""The cancellation of the annual meeting had a significant financial impact but, beyond that, the health crisis has caused us to postpone countless fundraising and membership events,"" said NRA spokesman Andrew Arulanandam. The virus has caused a record spike in US gun sales, according to the FBI. How the coronavirus led to the highest-ever spike in US gun sales The number of people who have died with coronavirus around the world has passed a quarter of a million - rising to 250,134, according to figures published by Johns Hopkins University. A music shop prepares to open in Colorado At least six more US states are loosening social distancing measures starting on Monday. Gyms in Arkansas can resume operation, as long as clients have their temperatures screened before entering. Florida beaches and parks can reopen, but not in the Miami area. Missouri businesses can open, but customers must keep six feet (two metres) apart. Nonessential businesses in Colorado are also permitted to reopen, but with limited capacity. Ohioâs governor is allowing manufacturing, construction and office work to resume starting on Monday. Retail shops are expected to reopen on 12 May. Indiana is moving towards its second stage of reopening and is allowing social gatherings of up to 25 people. But residents over 65 are encouraged to remain at home. Around half of US states have begun taking steps to reopen, even as health officials warn that the pandemic is not yet under control. The number of unemployed Austrians reached a record high in April, the country's news agency ANA reports. Figures showed 571,477 people, or 12.8% of the population, were unemployed - up more than 210,000 from the same time last year. Austria, which has 15,621 coronavirus cases and 600 deaths according to Johns Hopkins University, began relaxing its restrictions and allowing some shops to reopen in mid-April. Football matches in the UK are likely to be played behind closed doors for an extended period because of bans on mass gatherings amid the coronavirus pandemic. FA chairman Greg Clarke has saidit is hard to see fans returning ""any time soon"" and the Premier League is preparing for the possibility of playing next season without fans. So what would be the impact of a season without fans on the Premier League clubs? BBC Sport and football finance lecturer Kieran Maguire has taken a look. Research suggests Arsenal generated nearly a quarter of their total income from matchday last season, making them vulnerable financially. Read more here Players in the top two flights of football in Spain will return to training this week with the hope of the leagues restarting in June. They will initially train alone but a ""staggered return to training"" will be implemented with players training together at a later date. Football in Spain was suspended indefinitely in March because of the coronavirus pandemic. In the UK, the Premier League hopes to resume on 8 June but there isdisagreement between the clubs on how to move forward. In Germany, clubs have been training in groups before a planned return to training as teams. The German league could restart on 16 or 23 May. It has already been announced that the top leagues in France and the Netherlands will not resume. UK officials said on Monday it was ""perfectly reasonable"" to look at how guidance about the next
stage of coronavirus restrictions could apply to different age groups. The prime ministerâs spokesman pointed to the fact that over-70s had already been
advised to take particular care and minimise contact with others outside their
households, due to the fact they were classed as a clinically vulnerable group. He
said: âAs we go forward itâs perfectly reasonable we look at how the guidance
will apply for different age bands and we will continue to be guided by the
science.â People over 70 are more likely to have serious symptoms of the virus, but they are not automatically in the ""extremely vulnerable"" group of people who have been asked to ""shield"". Over the weekend, several public figures, including actor Michael Palin, called on the government to ensure older people were not unfairly separated from society as lockdown was lifted. Prime Minister Edouard Philippe spoke about religious services at a news conference on Monday France could allow religious services to resume earlier than planned if the easing of the lockdown this month does not result in an increase in the infection rate of coronavirus. France is set to ease its lockdown on 11 May but it had been indicated that religious ceremonies would still be banned until at least 2 June. The Christian holy day of Pentecost, celebrated 50 days after Easter Sunday, falls on 1 June. Nick Thorpe, BBC News Exams at Szerb Antal secondary school in Budapest In Hungary 84,000 pupils were back in classrooms on Monday to
sit their high school exams, despite the country's lockdown. Most appeared relieved that the
exams were not postponed,
but teachersâ unions and parents voiced concerns that pupils and staff might
spread coronavirus. Written exams have been condensed into two weeks, and no oral
exams will be held. The mood was festive outside the Bela
Bartok music gymnasium in central Budapest. Pupils who hadnât seen
each other for six weeks gathered in their best clothes, bumping elbows or
knuckles in greeting, but there was no hugging or kissing. They filed into classrooms one by one, and about half wore face
masks. At some schools police patrolled to enforce social distancing, but
not here. Inside, seven students sat in each classroom. Masks were not
compulsory during the exam, although supervisors kept theirs on. The main teachersâ union was not consulted by the government, and opposed
the decision to go ahead with the exams. With 3,000 known coronavirus infections and 350 deaths, the peak
has still not been reached in Hungary. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said in his Monday briefing that current data showed that no region of the state - which remains the epicentre of the pandemic in the US - is yet ready to reopen. There were 226 deaths in New York state on Sunday, down from 280 in the previous 24-hour period. But Cuomo said that new cases and deaths were not dropping as quickly as they first rose in the earliest days of the outbreak. ""Unfortunately we were hoping a quick up, plateau and a fast decline,"" Cuomo said. ""The decline is not as steep as the incline."" A British headteacher says he has spent Â£2,000 of his own money buying food for vulnerable families who are waiting to receive an alternative to free school meal vouchers. Lloyd Mason-Edwards, from Bradford in Yorkshire, said only about half the families eligible at his school had received them. The UK government has in England been converting free school meals for poorer children into supermarket vouchers since closing schools in March. He said the system was a ""shambles"" and was failing those in need. Read more. David ShukmanScience editor, BBC News Every time people cough, sneeze, talk or even breathe they
can spread droplets containing the virus. Thatâs the rather graphic conclusion of the Royal Society,
Britainâs oldest and most prestigious scientific academy. It highlights the risk of the virus being spread by people
who donât realise they have it - either because theyâve yet to develop symptoms
or because they never show symptoms at all. This is how an estimated 40-80% of coronavirus infections
happen and thatâs why the panel recommends face masks. The report stresses that high-quality masks should be
reserved for medical and care workers. But it says homemade face coverings can be effective, not at
protecting the wearer but at preventing the wearer from infecting others where
social distancing isnât possible, on public transport and in shops and
workplaces. The issue has become highly divisive. Some researchers say the Royal Societyâs report has ignored the risk to the public, for example, of contaminating themselves when handling masks. The UK government is still considering the evidence. It's hay fever season in some parts of the world, and the symptoms can be similar to those of coronavirus - so the UK's Royal College of General Practitioners is warning people not to
mix them up. It says it's concerned people may go outside thinking
they've just got the seasonal illness, when actually they have contracted the virus and should stay at home. Our health
correspondent Laura Foster explains how to tell the difference. This video can not be played Hay fever or coronavirus: The symptoms compared Philippa RoxbyHealth reporter, BBC News Whether people who are infected by the virus could catch it
for a second time is a question no-one yet knows the answer to. The key is whether antibodies build up in the bloodstream
when the body fights off this coronavirus, and how long they last afterwards to
protect people from further infections. Early research suggests good news. Most people do appear to develop
antibodies but how long they stick around for is still a mystery. Regularly following up people whoâve tested positive for a
number of years is the only way to find out how long immunity might last. The UK's health secretary himself is participating in a study
after contracting the virus several weeks ago. Are the antibodies still present? Are they at the same
level? Only time will tellâ¦ Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor We are, declared the prime minister at the end of last week, past the peak of the coronavirus pandemic in the UK. But he said we'd have to wait until this week to learn more about how we'll start to move out of the lockdown that has changed the country so dramatically in the past six weeks. Given that the crisis has affected pretty much everyone in one way or another, there is a fevered guessing game well under way about what moving out of the lockdown might look like - and it involves huge dilemmas for the government. With another six days to go before the prime minister is expected to spell out those choices, some things are clear. First and foremost, the government is not about to throw the country's doors open. Read more here on what easing lockdown could look like from our political editor Laura Kuenssberg. A view of the Finnish parliament in Helsinki Finland is going to allow restaurants, public services including libraries and sports facilities to reopen on 1 June. A ban on public meetings will also be eased from a maximum of 10 people to 50 people on the same day, the government said on Monday. Fewer Americans are remaining at home each day,according to a new study of mobile phone tracking data,externalfrom the University of Maryland. The anonymous location tracking data indicate a growing level of ""social distancing fatigue"", say the researchers at the Maryland Institute of Transportation. The researchers created a software code that creates a score for each state, called the Social Distancing Index, to determine how many residents are travelling away from their homes. Across the nation scores are dropping, indicating that gradually more and more Americans are venturing into public. Washington DC, where the rate of new cases is still growing, has the best social distancing score. Wyoming has the worst. Â© 2025 BBC.

McDonald's seeks rent cut from UK landlordsThe fast food chain is in talks with property firms as it prepares to reopen some sites.Business,"McDonald's has closed all its outlets in the UK McDonald's is in talks with some of its landlords in the UK about cutting rent payments as the fast food chain prepares to reopen some of its sites. Businesses face their next quarterly rent bill on 24 June when they are due to pay for the next three months. McDonald's said it has paid in full for the current quarter. However, it said that ""given the unprecedented situation"", it was in talks with landlords about how they could ""offer support"" on rent. McDonald's has closed all its outlets in the UK because of the coronavirus pandemic. A spokesman for the company said: ""We have opened dialogue with some of our landlords to discuss how they might offer support on rent and service charges for a short period due to our restaurants not trading."" Coronavirus: Shopping centre giant threatens brands over rent Coronavirus: Pub sector faces 'bloodbath' over rents McDonald's plans to reopen 15 outlets in the UK for delivery only services on 13 May. Other food chains such as Burger King and Yo! Sushi did not pay rent to landlords in the UK when it fell due in March. The government hasimplemented some measuresto help businesses who are struggling to pay their rent. But shopping centre-owner Intu said recently that it was considering legal action against some big brands who have money but are ""not engaging"" in rent negotiations. Intu, which owns Manchester's Trafford Centre and the Lakeside in Essex, declined to name the brands. In April, the British Retail Consortium and the British Property Federation both wrote to Chancellor Rishi Sunak seeking more support for shops and landlords. McDonald's plans to reopen some UK sites in May for delivery-only orders They want the government to support a ""furloughed space grant scheme"" where businesses would pay some rent, landlords would agree to a reduction and the state would make-up the shortfall. A spokesman for the Treasury said: ""We recognise the current challenges facing commercial landlords and the significant impact recent changes are having on their business models. We also recognise that many landlords are working closely with tenants to find solutions that work for both parties."" ""Our package of support for businesses currently includes our new bounce back loans, which provide quick and easy support for eligible companies that is interest-free for the first 12 months, our job retention scheme and other measures such as protecting commercial tenants from eviction."" Last week, McDonald's revealed that the coronavirus outbreak had sent first quarter like-for-like sales down 3.4%. It said around three quarters of its outlets across the world remained opened and were serving people via drive-throughs, delivery or takeaway services. But the UK is among a few of its markets where it has temporarily closed all of its sites. Others include France, Italy and Spain.
