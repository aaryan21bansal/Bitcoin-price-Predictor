UK ships prepare to leave Jersey after fishing row,"Two Royal Navy ships are preparing to return home after a protest by French fishermen over post-Brexit rights in Jersey's territorial waters ended. The UK government said ""the situation is resolved for now"" but ""we remain on standby"" to assist Jersey. French fishermen say their rights are unfairly restricted by licences issued under the Channel Island's new system. Jersey's External Relations Minister Ian Gorst said discussions with the French crews had been ""positive"". The UK said it had agreed with Jersey's government that one of the Royal Navy offshore patrol vessels will return to its home port on Thursday night while the other will leave on Friday morning. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was ""pleased the situation in Jersey has been resolved."" ""The UK will always stand resolutely by the people of Jersey,"" he said. What's the fishing row about? Who really owns UK fishing rights? What does the Brexit trade deal mean for fishing? About 60 boats took part in a protest at St Helier, Jersey's capital and main port, prompting the dispatch of two Royal Navy ships - HMS Severn and HMS Tamar - and two French vessels to the area. The French government said it was acting ""in a spirit of responsibility"" after the ""British failure"" to abide by the trade deal. It said it hoped the situation would be ""swiftly resolved by the full and total implementation"" of the deal, which France said allowed continued access to British waters for fishermen who worked in them prior to Brexit. ""We want to use all the leverage at our disposal to protect the fishing industry and enable it to continue its activities,"" a spokesman for France's ministry for Europe and foreign affairs said. By Jean Mackenzie, BBC Europe correspondent, in Carteret port on the Normandy coast As the boats pulled out of this harbour at 02:30 on Thursday morning, the fishermen were prepared for this 15-hour stand-off in the cold and rain. This protest was their plan to get noticed and it worked. Yes they are angry, but they are also shaken by these unexpected restrictions and worried about their livelihoods. Some fishermen have only been given permission to fish for a handful of days a year. One fisherman, who catches half his whelks and lobsters along Jersey's shores, told me if he can't get full access to Jersey's waters he will have to sell his boat and change his job. When they returned to the French coast this evening, drenched and exhausted, they were surprisingly upbeat. Talks with Jersey's government did not go well, they said, but they know they have been heard. They are now hopeful their government and Brussels will step in to resolve the issue. They feel their part is done, for now. A spokesman for fishermen from France's Normandy region suggested the situation was still in ""deadlock"". Hugo Lehuby told Reuters news agency: ""Either this gets resolved, or retaliatory measures are taken."" And a European Commission spokeswoman said ""additional conditions"" attached to the new fishing licences were a breach of the Brexit trade deal. France has threatened to cut off electricity to Jersey, the largest Channel Island and a Crown dependency, located 14 miles (22km) off France. Crown dependencies are not part of the UK, but are defended and represented internationally by the British government. The boats were protesting against new fishing rules - introduced last week by the Jersey government under the UK-EU Trade and Co-operation Agreement (TCA) - which require French boats to show they have a history of fishing in Jersey's waters. But it has been claimed additional requirements were added without notice. French authorities say ""new technical measures"" had not been communicated to the EU, rendering them ""null and void"". Jersey's Senator Gorst said after Thursday's talks ""all sides remain committed"" to resolving the concerns that led to the fisherman's protest. HMS Tamar is one of two Royal Navy ships sent to Jersey The Royal Navy ships sent to Jersey, HMS Severn and HMS Tamar, are based in Portsmouth and are routinely used for fisheries protection - with sailors able to board other boats for spot checks. They are both 90.5m in length, have two large guns, including a short-range anti-aircraft weapon, and are crewed by 45 sailors and up to 50 Royal Marines. France said its two vessels were not on military missions and were told to stay in French waters and to be near the French fishermen to ensure safety.

"Holiday costs to jump this summer, warns travel boss","Tel Aviv's beaches have been busy again as coronavirus restrictions have eased Prices for international travel are set to rise this year due to pent-up demand and fewer aeroplanes in service, a travel boss has warned. Booking.com's chief executive Glenn Fogel told the BBC that holiday ""prices are already going up"". Many airlines have significantly reduced the number of flights they operate due to travel restrictions. However, Tui's UK boss Andrew Flintham said it would be ""a long time"" before holiday firms try to boost profits. Mr Fogel said that despite huge demand, uncertainty makes it hard for airlines to plan bringing more planes back into service. ""There's so much pent-up demand,"" said Mr Fogel. ""Everybody wants to go travelling, but we all want to do it safely."" EU unveils plans for overseas tourists to return When can I holiday abroad and how will the green list work? Airlines' Covid travel pass ready 'within weeks' John Grant, an aviation analyst with global travel data provider OAG said this will have a knock-on impact on air fares as travel restrictions are eased. ""That will, in the short term, create a rush of pent-up demand and revenge spending,"" he said. ""In turn, the airline algorithms will detect an uptick in demand and move prices up accordingly"". Airlines have reduced capacity by putting aeroplanes into storage, such as these in France The government will shortly announce which foreign destinations holidaymakers from England can visit from 17 May without needing to quarantine on their return. Air fares to Portugal - which is expected to be on the green list - have already started to rise as airlines respond to higher demand. According to PA, British Airways is charging Â£530 for a flight from Heathrow to the Algarve on 17 May, compared with Â£276 two days earlier. A Ryanair flight from Stansted to Lisbon costs Â£262 on 19 May, PA found, more than double the price of Â£128 on 14 May. But Tui's managing director for the UK and Ireland, Andrew Flintham, told BBC Breakfast travel firms were unlikely to push up prices anytime soon. ""Our prices are very, very stable. They're pretty much like for like, flat, year over year. There isn't a big increase in there. ""We've got plenty of holidays to sell. I think everybody in the industry has. ""It'll be a long time before the idea of trying to increase prices to make more money. We want to get people away on holiday, having a great time, because we think they genuinely all deserve it."" A lack of clarity about how governments will go about recognising vaccine and testing statuses from other countries is troubling the travel industry, which has been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic. Mr Fogel believes a single system would be helpful: ""So many different people in so many different governments are talking about different programmes, but right now, there is nothing out there that is unified, so it's very confusing. ""I listened to the prime minister of Italy saying how they want to let people into Italy soon and you just have to prove that you have a vaccine and it'd be great. ""And my thinking is, well, I have my vaccine myself, but how do I prove it? Do I just bring my little white card that I got in the US that said I got it, is that going to be good enough? We need some clarifications."" Several systems are being explored, including the International Air Transport Association (IATA)'s travel pass, which is being trialled by a number of airlines. Meanwhile, theEuropean Union is working on having a digital passready in time for the summer holidays. The idea of a scheme that allows passengers who have had the vaccine to travel has proved divisive. The UK equality watchdog recently warned it could create a ""two-tier society, whereby only certain groups are able to fully enjoy their rights"". That's a view supported by the World Health Organization (WHO) but Mr Fogel disagrees. ""It's true that if you're not vaccinated, you may not be able to enter a country under this type of a system,"" he said. ""But I'm okay with that. Because the alternative is what - nobody gets to go in? That doesn't make a lot of sense to me."" He added that there are countries that people cannot go into if they don't have proof of vaccination against yellow fever, for example. ""There's nothing wrong with using technology to prove you are a safe traveller that can help get the industry up faster,"" said Mr Fogel. How to verify the coronavirus vaccine and test status of travellers like this man at Milan's Malpensa Airport has become a divisive issue The lack of clarity has hurt the finances of Booking.com's US owner Booking Holdings, which also owns Kayak and rentalcars.com. Revenues for the three months to the end of March fell to $1.1bn (Â£790m) - 50% lower than the same period a year ago. Figures from the World Travel & Tourism Council (WTTC) reflect a similar picture across the industry, showing tourism's value to the global economy fell from nearly $9.2tn in 2019 to $4.7tn in 2020. As a share of the global economy that equates to a fall from 10.4% to just 5.5%. But Mr Fogel, who is chief executive of both the Dutch-based Booking.com and its parent firm Booking Holdings, told investors that there is still reason to be optimistic things will improve. ""While the pace of vaccine distribution remains frustratingly slow in most places around the world, Israel, the UK and the US are benefiting from successful vaccine distribution programs,"" he said. ""In each of these countries, we have seen encouraging booking trends, which supports our view that vaccine distribution is key to unlocking pent-up travel demand.""

The sepia-toned picture, taken on Thursday, shows the toddler standing in a garden with his back to the camera, holding a large bunch of balloons. It was shared on theirArchewell website,external, along with a plea for donations to a fund for Covid vaccinations in poor nations. The Queen and other members of the Royal Family sent birthday messages. A message from the Royal Family's official Twitter account,externalsaid: ""Wishing Archie Mountbatten-Windsor a very happy 2nd birthday today."" The post was shared alongside a picture of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex with their son days after he was born. Royal Family tree and line of succession William and Harry seen chatting after funeral Ina statement on their Archewell foundation website,external, Prince Harry and Meghan - who are expecting their second child - said they were ""deeply touched"" by people who had donated to charities in honour of Archie's birthday in previous years. They urged people to support GAVI, the global vaccine alliance, saying: ""We will not be able to truly recover until everyone, everywhere, has equal access to the vaccine. ""We cannot think of a more resonant way to honour our son's birthday. If we all show up, with compassion for those we both know and don't know, we can have a profound impact."" Meanwhile, the duke and duchess also wrote an open letter to major Covid vaccine manufacturers such as Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca, urging them to redouble support for the UN-sponsored Covax programme distributing doses in poorer parts of the world. And asmomentum builds around a US-backed proposal to waive vaccine patents, Harry and Meghan called on the firms to temporarily suspend intellectual property rights on Covid-19 vaccines. Archie lives with his parents in California, following Prince Harry and Meghan's decision to step back as senior royals and move to the US. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, Archie's uncle and aunt, along with his grandparents the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall, also posted birthday messages from their Twitter accounts. Alongside their message, Charles and his wife shared a photo of the Prince of Wales with Harry and Archie at his christening. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Germany opposes waiving Covid vaccine patents,"Germany has voiced opposition to a US-backed proposal to waive patents on Covid-19 vaccines, saying they were not hindering production of the jabs. Its government said ""the protection of intellectual property is a source of innovation and must remain so"". The European Union earlier said it was ready to talk about the proposal, and some states gave it their full backing. Supporters of the plan say it will allow more manufactures to produce the life-saving vaccines. They argue that this will increase access to jabs in poorer countries. But opponents, including drug makers, say it may not have the desired effect. Could lifting patents mean Covid vaccines for all? How will we know Covid vaccines are safe? Covid map: Where are cases the highest? The idea was originally proposed by India and South Africa, who have been leading a group of about 60 countries at the World Trade Organization (WTO) -an intergovernmental body that promotes global commerce. The group is pushing for the temporary removal of intellectual property protections on vaccines. The proposal was met with strong opposition from the previous US administration of Donald Trump, as well as the UK and the EU. But it gained momentum this week afterthe US backed it. WTO head Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala told the BBC's Newshour programme that she welcomed US support for the waiver. She said members should negotiate a pragmatic agreement over vaccine production because the current inequity was ""not right"". Ms Okonjo-Iweala acknowledged the shortage of raw materials and technical expertise required on the ground, but said they would need to start somewhere to boost global supplies. Meanwhile in Germany, Health Minister Jens Spahn said the country would allow the AstraZeneca vaccine to be administered to all adults, reversing aprevious decision to restrict the shot to people over the age of 60 because of concerns over rare blood clotsseen in a tiny number of recipients.Â In a statement on Thursday, the German government said the US-backed proposal would have ""significant implications for vaccine production as a whole"". ""The limiting factors in the production of vaccines are the production capacities and the high quality standards and not patents,"" it said, adding that pharmaceutical companies were already working with partners to ramp up manufacturing. Germany is the EU's biggest economic power and home to a major pharmaceutical sector, including BioNTech which developed one of the most widely-used coronavirus vaccines. The remarks by the German government came after European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the bloc was ""ready to discuss"" the proposal on waiving patents. Ms von der Leyen has previously spoken about her opposition to lifting intellectual property rights, telling the New York Times just weeks ago that she was ""not at all a friend of releasing patents"". Ursula von der Leyen said the EU was ""ready to discuss any proposals that address the crisis in an effective and pragmatic manner"" Meanwhile, officials in other member states such as France and Italy gave the proposal their full backing. The issue is reportedly set to be on the agenda at a two-day EU meeting this week. Outside of the EU, Russian President Vladimir Putin said he supported the idea of a waiver. The UK government said it was ""working with WTO members to resolve this issue"" and was ""in discussions with the US and WTO members to facilitate increased production and supply of Covid-19 vaccines"". Intellectual property describes creations, such as inventions, which are protected by patents, copyrights and trademarks. These prevent copying and allow the originator to be financially rewarded. Patents give innovating firms a short-term monopoly on production to cover the costs of development and encourage investment. Biotech firms argue that such protection has provided incentives to produce Covid vaccines in record times. Many developing countries have argued that rules requiring countries to protect patents and other forms of intellectual property are an obstacle to increasing the production of vaccines and other products needed to tackle the pandemic. Calls for a vaccine patent waiver come as lower income countries face acute vaccine shortages. This video can not be played How to tell a Covid-19 vaccine sceptic the facts But opponents, particularly from the industry, have said it will not solve the problem. The head of the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations, Thomas Cueni, told the BBC's Today programme he was ""deeply concerned"" that ""you could compromise the quality and safety of vaccines which we see now"". ""It is shortages and scarcity in the supply chains, which need to be addressed. And it is also right now the disappointing unwillingness of rich countries to early share doses with the poor countries,"" he said. Some experts say pharmaceutical companies would also need to share know-how, such as production techniques, with poorer countries to have any real beneficial effect. Nobody is protected until everyone's protected: on that world and business leaders are agreed. But pharmaceutical companies have called the decision by the US to back the sharing of secret recipes for vaccinations shortsighted, claiming it is understanding the production process that is the real challenge. It is, they say, akin to handing out a recipe without sharing the method or the ingredients, and could lead to quality issues and less efficient production Instead, the UK and the EU have favoured a system of licensing, whereby knowhow is shared and there is more oversight. It is already being done on some cases on a voluntary basis - such as the tie up between Oxford-AstraZeneca and the Serum Institute of India. And that licensing can be made compulsory, although the pharmaceutical companies could then be eligible for compensation. Some trade specialists have speculated that the US might be hoping that, by backing a lifting of patents, manufacturers might be more open to sharing expertise voluntarily - or at least, for a reduced charge.

Plastic bag charge to double to 10p in all shops,"The single-use carrier bag charge will rise from 5p to 10p and be extended to all businesses in England from 21 May. The government said all stores, including corner shops, will now have to apply the charge from that date. The 5p levy on plastic bags was introduced in England in 2015. Since then their use has fallen by over 95%. The average person in England now buys just four single-use carrier bags a year from the main supermarkets, compared with 140 in 2014. ""The introduction of the 5p charge has been a phenomenal success,"" said Environment Minister Rebecca Pow. Co-op to scrap plastic 'bags for life' Morrisons to stop selling plastic carrier bags By extending the charge to all retailers, the government hopes the use of single-use carrier bags will fall by 70-80% in small and medium-sized businesses. ""We know we must go further to protect our natural environment and oceans, which is why we are now extending this charge to all businesses,"" said Ms Pow. ""Over the next couple of weeks I urge all retailers of all sizes to make sure they are ready for the changes, as we work together to build back greener and strengthen our world-leading action to combat the scourge of plastic waste."" Morrisons has switched from offering plastic ""bags for life to paper bags Association of Convenience Stores chief executive, James Lowman, said: ""We strongly welcome the inclusion of local shops and other small businesses into the successful plastic bag charging scheme, which not only helps the environment, but is also a great way for retailers to raise money for local and national charities."" John Lewis said it was trialling the removal of single-use bags from its Cheltenham, Kingston and Leeds stores from 21 May. Customers will be asked to bring their own bags or buy a reusable bag made from 100% recyclable material costing 50p for a medium size and 75p for a large size. Marija Rompani, director of ethics and sustainability for the John Lewis Partnership, said: ""It has become the norm to take our own bags when we go food shopping but we have a different mindset when shopping for clothes, beauty and home products. ""We expect our customers will be supportive of this change and will be listening to their feedback."" ""Plastic pollution is one of the most visible symptoms of the environmental crisis, damaging natural habitats and putting precious wildlife at risk,"" sasid Paula Chin, sustainable materials specialist at the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF). ""Measures to reduce plastics consumption need to go much further. The UK government must consider a complete ban on single-use bags and make sure this is not undermined by the sale of 'bags for life', which are currently cheaply available and all too often end up as single-use items."" This video can not be played How plastic bags were supposed to help the planet The Co-op became the latest supermarket chain to say it will stop selling plastic ""bags for life"" last month. The retailer, which has 2,600 shops, said many people only used the 10p bags once before throwing them away. The Co-op said its move would take 29.5 million bags for life, or about 870 tonnes of plastic, out of circulation every year. Earlier last month Morrisons said it would switch from offering plastic ""bags for life"" to a paper alternative. In recent years, all supermarkets have tried to cut plastics use. Waitrose is currently trialling the removal of its 10p bags for life from several of its stores. Sainsbury's has said its bags for life cost 20p to encourage customers to re-use them and are made from 100% recycled plastic. Tesco increased the price of its bags for life to 20p in September 2020 and doesn't sell single-use bags.

Cutting methane gas 'crucial for climate fight',"Methane gas bubbles trapped in a frozen Alaskan lake Reducing emissions of methane gas is vital for tackling climate change in the short-term, a major UN report says. Methane is produced when living things decompose; it's also in natural gas. It persists for just a short time in the atmosphere - unlike carbon dioxide - but methane is a much more potent global warming gas than CO2. The report says ""urgent steps"" are necessary in order to reduce methane if global warming is to be kept within a limit laid down in the Paris deal. This agreement, signed by 200 countries, aims to keep the global temperature rise to within 1.5C above pre-industrial levels by the end of this century. The 1.5C target is regarded as the gateway to ""dangerous"" warming, where the planet could experience serious adverse effects of climate change. Satellites picture methane across the globe Methane pulse detected from South Sudan wetlands Satellite achieves sharp-eyed view of methane The report comes as data showed both CO2 and methane (CH4) in the atmospherereached record highs last year,external. This happened despite pandemic lockdowns, which massively reduced economic activity. The good news is that the UN report says rapid and significant reductions in the greenhouse gas are possible using existing technologies and a very low cost. Methane is also a source for another gas - ozone - in the lowest layer of the Earth's atmosphere (known as the troposphere) In addition to saving money, cutting methane would yield significant health benefits by reducing the amount of ground-level ozone - a pollutant that's harmful to the human body. The recommendations come from an international team of scientists, who have produced the Global Methane Assessment for the UN Environment Programme (Unep). Methane is the major component of natural gas Drew Shindell, the study's lead author, and a professor of Earth science at Duke University in Durham, US, agrees CO2 is the number one target in the fight against climate change, but says cutting methane will have a more rapid impact. ""So many aspects of climate change are happening faster than expected"", he said. ""We see more fires, more of the strongest hurricanes, more heatwaves, and methane is the best lever we have to reduce the growth in those over the next 30 years."" Scientists regard a temperature rise of 1.5C above pre-industrial levels as a gateway to ""dangerous"" warming of the planet. The Paris agreement, signed by nearly 200 countries, aims to keep the increase to within the 1.5C target. The new report says measures available now could reduce emissions from human activities by as much as 180 million tonnes a year by 2030 - 45% of the total per year. The main sources of human-related methane are the fossil fuel industry, which accounts for 34% of total emissions, agriculture which contributes another 40% and the waste sector 20%. One of the difficulties in tackling the methane problem has been knowing precisely where the gas is coming from. But this is changing thanks to an emerging satellite capability that can pinpoint sources. The Canadian company GHGSat has the highest-resolution instrument in orbit currently, able to detect plumes of CH4 down to about 25m across. In the example above, the technology is tracking emissions from a giant landfill area serving the Indonesian capital, Jakarta. The area is outputting 16 tonnes of CH4 every hour, equivalent to nearly 400 tonnes/hr of CO2. On an annualised basis, this is like the greenhouse gas output of 750,000 cars driving for a year. GHGSat's spacecraft are being followed by a fleet of other methane-detecting satellites this decade. Identifying super-emitters is about to get a lot easier. The Unep report says the fossil fuel industry has the greatest potential for low-cost methane cuts. Plugging leaks in oil and gas wells and along production and transmission lines would significantly cut methane emissions at little to no cost, it concludes. Many of the reductions could quickly pay for themselves because reducing leaks means more gas available for sale. But the report warns the continued expansion of the use of natural gas is not compatible with keeping warming to 1.5C without what it calls ""massive-scale deployment of unproven carbon removal technologies"". The waste sector could cut its methane emissions by improving the disposal of sewage around the world. Improving the management of rice paddies has the potential to reduce emissions from agriculture but the report says the biggest generators of agricultural methane - livestock - are harder to abate. This video can not be played Gases produced by livestock are a major factor in global warming, so should we change our eating habits? There is little scope for technical solutions, it concludes, so the effort needs to be focused on reducing food waste and loss, improving livestock management and encouraging consumers to adopt what the report calls ""healthier diets"" - those with a lower meat and dairy content. If a concerted effort managed to achieve that 45% cut in methane emissions, it would help avoid nearly 0.3C of global warming as early as the 2040s, the report claims. Because of methane's contribution to the formation of ozone, up to a quarter of a million premature deaths could be avoided worldwide under the most aggressive emission abatement efforts. This attempt to focus on the issue of methane is very welcome, said Myles Allen, professor of geosystem science at Oxford University, provided it does not distract from the need to reduce CO2 emissions to net zero as soon as possible. Prof Euan Nisbet, from the greenhouse gas group at Royal Holloway, University of London, said: ""The actions it suggests, like cutting gas leaks and landfill emissions, are sensible, cost-effective and economically realistic. If fully implemented, these relatively inexpensive measures will help avoid nearly 0.3C of warming by mid-century.""

Rio de Janeiro drugs raid shoot-out leaves 25 dead,"This video can not be played Aerial footage shows suspects of a wanted drug gang trying to escape police At least 25 people including a police officer have been killed in a shootout in Rio de Janeiro, according to local media. The shootout took place during a police operation in a favela in the Jacarezinho area of the city. Police launched the operation after receiving reports that drug traffickers were recruiting children for their gang. Two passengers on a metro train were hit by bullets but survived. Police in the Brazilian city confirmed the death of one of their officers, Inspector Andre Leonardo de Mello Frias. A statement on Facebook said""he honoured the profession he loved and will be missed"".,external Police Chief Ronaldo Oliveira told Reuters news agency that Thursday's raid was ""the largest number of deaths in a police operation in Rio"". From 2019: A 'policy of massacre' in Rio's favelas? Listen to the documentary Lethal force in Rio's favelas Brazil's racial reckoning: 'Black lives matter here, too' According to local news, the gang targeted in this raid engages in drug trafficking, mugging, murders and kidnappings. Television images showed suspects trying to escape across rooftops as police entered the favela. Civil Police showed off weapons and drugs seized during the raid Meanwhile, residents of Jacarezinho have shared accounts of what they witnessed on social media. One resident posted a photo of his blood-covered floor and said two people had died in his house as police chased the criminals. The man, who did not want to give his name, said he would try to move out of the area as soon as possible. ""We're trying to sell the house as fast as possible, we can't continue to live here,"" he said. Other residents said officers had seized their phones, accusing them of warning gang members of the raid. Sociology professor Ignacio Cano from the Laboratory for the Analysis of Violence at Rio State University dismissed the reasons the police gave for the raid: ""To say that drug traffickers recruit children and teenagers to deal drugs is almost laughable because everyone knows that these gangs have minors who work for them. ""To say that you're going to launch a massive raid because you've discovered that traffickers recruit children is a joke,"" he told O Dia newspaper. Rio de Janeiro is one of Brazil's most violent states Rio de Janeiro is one of Brazil's most violent states and vast areas are under the control of criminals, many of them linked to powerful drug-trafficking gangs. Security forces in Brazil have often been accused of excessive use of force against the civilian population during anti-crime operations in major cities. A court ruling last June restricted police action in poor neighbourhoods of Rio during the pandemic unless it was deemed essential. Rio de Janeiro is the city with the biggest percentage of people living in shanty towns in Brazil - 22%. It's a population of 1,3 million, 70% of which are black. Analysis by Camilla Motta, BBC Brasil reporter, Sao Paulo Police operations targeting favelas controlled by drug traffickers are quite common in Rio. This, however, is the deadliest operation since 2016. Since a court ruling last June restricted police action in poor neighbourhoods in Rio, the number of deaths in shootouts in favelas has fallen. In the first month alone, deaths plummeted 70% when compared to the average recorded since 2007, according to the research group Grupo de Estudos dos Novos Ilegalismos, from Universidade Federal Fluminense. The drop was not followed by a rise in crime. In fact, property crimes were down by 40% and homicides by 48%. Researchers argue this shows that police operations are not the best strategy to tackle crime.

Sturgeon clashes with right-wing candidate,"Nicola Sturgeon was involved in a tense confrontation with a far-right candidate as she visited a polling station in the south of Glasgow. The SNP leader was praised on social media for how she handled an approach from a former deputy leader of Britain First. Jayda Fransen accused Ms Sturgeon of ""flooding"" the country with immigrants. Footage posted online showed the first minister call Ms Fransen ""a fascist and a racist"". Ms Fransen, who has convictions for religiously aggravated harassment, is an independent candidate in Glasgow Southside, the same constituency  as Nicola Sturgeon. On Thursday evening, a video was widely shared on social media showing Ms Fransen approach Ms Sturgeon in the street. She said: ""What are you sorry for? Mass immigration, Marxism?

Ms Fransen said: ""The locals, what the ones you have flooded from other countries? ""The decent people of Scotland don't want it flooded with immigrants."" Ms Sturgeon then told her: ""You are a fascist, you are a racist and the southside of Glasgow will reject you."" The first minister then walked away with party members as Ms Fransen pursued her, talking about ""mass immigration"" and ""Marxism"". Ms Fransen later told an SNP supporter who asked her who she was: ""I'm not fascist, just a normal, decent unionist patriot. My grandfather fought the Nazis."" In a piece to camera uploaded afterwards by the British Freedom Party, she accused Ms Sturgeon of ""running away like a coward"", adding: ""Of course if you flood a constituency with foreigners and hardline republicans who absolutely hate Britain, hate the Union, they are going to secure their votes. ""The unionist community are no longer unrepresented and we are coming for you."" Jayda Fransen, pictured outside court in 2018, was convicted for comments made in Northern Ireland in 2017 Ms Fransen has previously been pictured outside the constituency office of Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf holding a sign saying ""it's okay to be white"" and has said she is running against the ""SNP commie, Marxists, naughty people"". She has previously been convicted of a number of religiously aggravated crimes, including harassment in both 2016 and 2018 - the latter of which saw her sentenced to 36 weeks in prison. Although a member of the British Freedom Party, documents from Glasgow City Council show Ms Fransen is running as an independent.

US sends reinforcements for Afghan withdrawal,"The US and Nato have had a presence in Afghanistan for almost 20 years The United States has deployed extra military resources to protect American and coalition forces withdrawing from Afghanistan. Heavy bombers and fighter jets will be deployed to safeguard troops and civilian contractors. The US and Nato have had a presence in Afghanistan for almost 20 years. US President Joe Biden has set the withdrawal deadline for 11 September - the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks that sparked the war. But the withdrawal comes amid escalating violence, with Afghan security forces on high alert for reprisal attacks. The Taliban have warned they are no longer bound by an agreement not to target international troops. Under a deal signed last year between the militants and then-President Donald Trump, foreign forces were to have left by 1 May while the Taliban held off attacking international troops. What do US veterans think of Afghan War? 20 years in Afghanistan: Was it worth it? 'We have won the war, America has lost' Six B-52 long range bombers and 12 F-18 fighters have been deployed to protect the departing contingents of 2,500 US service members and 16,000 civilian contractors, said Mark Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. General Milley added that while Taliban insurgents were launching between 80 and 120 attacks every day against Afghan government targets, there had been no attacks against US and coalition forces since the withdrawal began on 1 May. ""Less than one week in, the drawdown is going according to plan,"" Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin told reporters. On 11 September 2001, attacks in America killed nearly 3,000 people. Osama Bin Laden, the head of Islamist militant group al-Qaeda, was quickly identified as the man responsible. The Taliban, radical Islamists who ran Afghanistan and protected Bin Laden, refused to hand him over. So, a month after 9/11, the US launched air strikes against Afghanistan. This video can not be played Tens of thousands of Afghan soldiers have been killed and injured. This 2019 video tells their story. As other countries joined the war, the Taliban were quickly removed from power. But they didn't just disappear - their influence grew back and they dug in. Since then, the US and its allies have struggled to stop Afghanistan's government collapsing, and to end deadly attacks by the Taliban. The withdrawal of US troops begins against a backdrop of fierce clashes between the Taliban and government forces, in the absence of a peace deal. Last week, a car bombing in Pul-e-Alam, Logar province,killed up to 30 people and wounded 110- mostly school pupils. President Biden says the US pull-out is justified as US forces have made sure the country cannot again become a base for foreign jihadists to plot against the West. Hillary Clinton warns of 'huge consequences' in Afghan withdrawal Afghan President Ashraf Ghani says government forces are fully capable of keeping insurgents at bay. But many do not share the optimism, believing the withdrawal could plunge the country back to the dark days of the Taliban era.

Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor The national polling puts Conservatives ahead most of the time, but there are matters that exist in local communities which can't be accounted for in national polling. The parties are flying blind this time around. They haven't been able to campaign on the doorstep due to the pandemic. Whether it's Hartlepool's MP or Wakefield's council, the Conservatives are hoping to show they can dig further into territory which would have been alien to them a decade ago. Labour is under pressure to show that under Sir Keir Starmer, they're able to stop the rot. Whether Nicola Sturgeon can achieve an overall majority in Holyrood, then the UK could be headed for another couple of years of very intense constitutional debate. It could very quickly become Boris Johnson's biggest headache. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Two voters in Glasgow North West have said they were temporarily turned away from a polling station because ballot boxes were ""too full"". Nadeem and Joanna Basharat were turned away from Jordanhill Parish Church polling station at 8:30pm, and told to come back later. A steward said ballot box 52 was too full and they were told to come back by 10pm. When they went back to vote, they said the box was still very full. It looked like the papers inside had just been ""pushed down"". A spokesman for Glasgow's Returning Officer said: ""The sheer size of the regional paper meant some ballot boxes became full. We were able to deliver replacement boxes, but in this case some voters were asked to wait outside before voting. ""The presiding officer is confident that all voters who were asked to wait were ultimately able to vote."" Labour and the Conservatives have both sought to play down expectations as the votes begin to be counted. Labour acknowledged the elections would be ""tough"", with a Labour source saying: ""Keir has always been honest about the mountain we must climb to rebuild trust to win the next general election. ""Labour is listening and we will continue to change in order to win back the trust of working people in Britain and their communities."" It's a similar story from the Conservatives. A Tory source said it was ""looking tough in Hartlepool"" as ""Labour have flooded the area with activists"". Conservative staff had been encouraged to use spare time on Thursday evening to make calls for the candidate Jill Mortimer. It was also suggested it was a ""mixed picture"" across the country. Young people aged 16 and 17-years-old could vote in today's Scottish and Welsh elections - but not in England. We spoke to some teenagers in Leeds to see what they thought - and what policies they cared about. This video can not be played Alex ForsythPolitical correspondent The amount of journalists descending on the town of Hartlepool in the past few weeks shows the level of interest in how this town will vote in their by-election. It's a crucial test for Boris Johnson's Conservatives, whether the support they won at the general election in 2019 was a one-off, or if it's something they can sustain. If Labour lose here, a seat they've held for decades, then it will cause questions for Sir Keir Starmer, as well as deeper questions for the party itself. The ballot boxes are coming in now, and we should know the result in the morning. We will soon know if traditional party allegiances are starting to fray. Ballot papers are arriving at the Mill House Leisure Centre in Hartlepool for the counting overnight. We're hoping to be able to report a result at about 04:00 BST. Heavy snowfall reopened the Lake District Ski Club today For pretty obvious reasons, weather can affect turnout on polling day. In 2019,researchers from the University of Reading,externalanalysed turnout for the constituency of Wokingham since 1945. They found:  Scotland has reported wet, cold, windy weather today. Across the highlands of Scotland, there's been heavy snowfall. BBC Weather has reported that in the whole of April, 3mm of rain fell in Leuchars in Scotland, but in the past six days there has been more than 10 times that. And it's been a pretty wet day across much of England, and particularly cold for this time of year. Hywel GriffithBBC News' Wales Correspondent The question in any Welsh election is not if Labour will hold on to power in the Welsh Government, it's more how many seats they will secure. Out of 22 years in power, they've never had an overall majority of the 60 seats in the Senedd. They won 29 seats last time, and the overall assumption this time is that their seats will be decreased a bit, potentially to the low 20s. The Conservatives are feeling pretty confident that they might have secured second place in polling, particularly through Labour-held seats in north east Wales. It's been harder for Plaid Cymru to break through during the pandemic, they've been largely in agreement with Labour's policies over the past year. Their leader, Adam Price, may yet find himself in power if Labour need help to govern during the next Senedd session. Counting won't start until tomorrow. Results should be known by tomorrow night. The polls in the Scottish election have closed and counting will begin from 09:00 GMT on Friday. You can find resultsas they come in here.

been a big set of elections that will take a while to digest. Not least of all
because the counts are going to go on for days. Overnight, the immediate focus
will likely be what's happened in the Hartlepool by-election; it's one of the
few counts taking place in the wee hours. Has Labour held on or will Boris
Johnson have taken another bite out of that so-called ""red wall""? While by-elections aren't exact litmus tests of public opinion, leaders will
inevitably be judged by their party's performance in such a contest. However
given the sheer number of polls in play there will be plenty else to chew over
- locally and nationally - across England, Wales and Scotland. And, of course, the future of the United Kingdom itself has again been up for discussion with
the SNP hoping this election can bolster its case for a further independence
referendum. Unlike a general election tonight there will no big, instantaneous
exit poll. This bumper set of elections is going to require a bit of patience
as we wait for results to roll in. It's 22:00 BST - and that means the polls are closed. The last of the votes have been cast and the counting (in some places) can now begin. Some contests will declare overnight - including the Hartlepool by-election, while the outcome of Welsh elections should be known by the end ofFriday. The West Midlands mayoral results are expected onSaturdayafternoon and the outcome of the Scottish Parliament results could arrive later that evening. Sunday, at the latest, will bring us London and West Yorkshire mayoral results - as well as more news from the English councils. The final results for police and crime commissioners should arrive byMonday. It's been a challenge for officials and volunteers to get polling stations ready for a safe vote amid the pandemic. Measures have included perspex screens and sanitary wipes for booths. The BBC put together a list ofdos, don'ts and coronavirus safety measures here.

Whether Nicola Sturgeon can achieve an overall majority in Holyrood, then the UK could be headed for another couple of years of very intense constitutional debate. It could very quickly become Boris Johnson's biggest headache. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Two voters in Glasgow North West have said they were temporarily turned away from a polling station because ballot boxes were ""too full"". Nadeem and Joanna Basharat were turned away from Jordanhill Parish Church polling station at 8:30pm, and told to come back later. A steward said ballot box 52 was too full and they were told to come back by 10pm. When they went back to vote, they said the box was still very full. It looked like the papers inside had just been ""pushed down"". A spokesman for Glasgow's Returning Officer said: ""The sheer size of the regional paper meant some ballot boxes became full. We were able to deliver replacement boxes, but in this case some voters were asked to wait outside before voting. ""The presiding officer is confident that all voters who were asked to wait were ultimately able to vote."" Labour and the Conservatives have both sought to play down expectations as the votes begin to be counted. Labour acknowledged the elections would be ""tough"", with a Labour source saying: ""Keir has always been honest about the mountain we must climb to rebuild trust to win the next general election. ""Labour is listening and we will continue to change in order to win back the trust of working people in Britain and their communities."" It's a similar story from the Conservatives. A Tory source said it was ""looking tough in Hartlepool"" as ""Labour have flooded the area with activists"". Conservative staff had been encouraged to use spare time on Thursday evening to make calls for the candidate Jill Mortimer. It was also suggested it was a ""mixed picture"" across the country. Young people aged 16 and 17-years-old could vote in today's Scottish and Welsh elections - but not in England. We spoke to some teenagers in Leeds to see what they thought - and what policies they cared about. This video can not be played Alex ForsythPolitical correspondent The amount of journalists descending on the town of Hartlepool in the past few weeks shows the level of interest in how this town will vote in their by-election. It's a crucial test for Boris Johnson's Conservatives, whether the support they won at the general election in 2019 was a one-off, or if it's something they can sustain. If Labour lose here, a seat they've held for decades, then it will cause questions for Sir Keir Starmer, as well as deeper questions for the party itself. The ballot boxes are coming in now, and we should know the result in the morning. We will soon know if traditional party allegiances are starting to fray. Ballot papers are arriving at the Mill House Leisure Centre in Hartlepool for the counting overnight. We're hoping to be able to report a result at about 04:00 BST. Heavy snowfall reopened the Lake District Ski Club today For pretty obvious reasons, weather can affect turnout on polling day. In 2019,researchers from the University of Reading,externalanalysed turnout for the constituency of Wokingham since 1945. They found:  Scotland has reported wet, cold, windy weather today. Across the highlands of Scotland, there's been heavy snowfall. BBC Weather has reported that in the whole of April, 3mm of rain fell in Leuchars in Scotland, but in the past six days there has been more than 10 times that. And it's been a pretty wet day across much of England, and particularly cold for this time of year. Hywel GriffithBBC News' Wales Correspondent The question in any Welsh election is not if Labour will hold on to power in the Welsh Government, it's more how many seats they will secure. Out of 22 years in power, they've never had an overall majority of the 60 seats in the Senedd. They won 29 seats last time, and the overall assumption this time is that their seats will be decreased a bit, potentially to the low 20s. The Conservatives are feeling pretty confident that they might have secured second place in polling, particularly through Labour-held seats in north east Wales. It's been harder for Plaid Cymru to break through during the pandemic, they've been largely in agreement with Labour's policies over the past year. Their leader, Adam Price, may yet find himself in power if Labour need help to govern during the next Senedd session. Counting won't start until tomorrow. Results should be known by tomorrow night. The polls in the Scottish election have closed and counting will begin from 09:00 GMT on Friday. You can find resultsas they come in here.

been a big set of elections that will take a while to digest. Not least of all
because the counts are going to go on for days. Overnight, the immediate focus
will likely be what's happened in the Hartlepool by-election; it's one of the
few counts taking place in the wee hours. Has Labour held on or will Boris
Johnson have taken another bite out of that so-called ""red wall""? While by-elections aren't exact litmus tests of public opinion, leaders will
inevitably be judged by their party's performance in such a contest. However
given the sheer number of polls in play there will be plenty else to chew over
- locally and nationally - across England, Wales and Scotland. And, of course, the future of the United Kingdom itself has again been up for discussion with
the SNP hoping this election can bolster its case for a further independence
referendum. Unlike a general election tonight there will no big, instantaneous
exit poll. This bumper set of elections is going to require a bit of patience
as we wait for results to roll in. It's 22:00 BST - and that means the polls are closed. The last of the votes have been cast and the counting (in some places) can now begin. Some contests will declare overnight - including the Hartlepool by-election, while the outcome of Welsh elections should be known by the end ofFriday. The West Midlands mayoral results are expected onSaturdayafternoon and the outcome of the Scottish Parliament results could arrive later that evening. Sunday, at the latest, will bring us London and West Yorkshire mayoral results - as well as more news from the English councils. The final results for police and crime commissioners should arrive byMonday. It's been a challenge for officials and volunteers to get polling stations ready for a safe vote amid the pandemic. Measures have included perspex screens and sanitary wipes for booths. The BBC put together a list ofdos, don'ts and coronavirus safety measures here.

Childish Gambino sued over This Is America,"This Is America topped the US chart and won the Grammys for both record and song of the year Childish Gambino is being sued for copyright infringement over his Grammy Award-winning rap song This Is America. Emelike Nwosuocha, a rapper who performs as Kidd Wes, claims the song copied his trackMade In America,external, which was released two years earlier. The ""lyrical theme, content and structure"" of the two songs' choruses are ""glaringly similar"", he said in court documents filed in New York. Childish Gambino, aka Donald Glover, has yet to respond to the claims. In 2019,This Is America,externalmade history by becoming the first rap track to win song of the year at the Grammy Awards. One of the most-discussed and powerful songs of the year, it delivered a scathing message about racial inequality, police brutality and gun violence, which was amplified by its provocative music video. However, in court documents, Nwosuocha said there was a ""substantial similarity"" between Glover's track and his own. He claimed the songs shared a ""distinct and unique vocal cadence, delivery, rhythm, timing [and] phrasing"", and noted how the choruses of Made In America and This Is America were written in the same metre. Nwosuocha alleged that the similarity in lyrical content and delivery was ""striking to an extent beyond coincidence"" and ""audible to the average lay person"". The rapper also employed a musicologist to compare the two tracks, who concluded that ""these similarities are likely not coincidences"", the court documents said. This video can not be played 'I choreographed This is America, and this is my story' Nwosuocha is demanding a trial and is seeking damages including lost profits and opportunities. While no sum is mentioned, he claimed that Glover and his co-writers made ""hundreds of millions of dollars"" from This Is America. His legal case also named Childish Gambino's record label, RCA, Roc Nation and Young Thug, who performed backing vocals on the track. Review: Childish Gambino's This is America âââââ Childish Gambino makes Grammys history However, it is not the first time that Glover has been accused of plagiarising This Is America. In 2018, a hip-hop blogger named Akademiks noted a similarity between the song and American Pharaoh by New York rapper Jase Harley. However, Harley said he had no interest in pursuing legal action. ""I feel extremely humbled to be recognised and labelled as one of, or the original inspiration, for one of the most important pieces of music and visual art of our time,"" he posted on Instagram. ""I appreciate all the love and support! But please don't let this controversy dilute the message me and Childish Gambino are trying to convey."" Childish Gambino's manager Fam Udeorji rejected the claims of plagiarism, saying his client's song actually dated back to 2015, ""and we have the Pro Tools [computer] files to prove it"". If so, the song would also pre-date Nwosuocha's Made In America, which he first posted on SoundCloud in September 2016. The BBC has contacted Childish Gambino's team for a response.

"Boy, 16, charged with murder of father of four","James Gibbons had just celebrated his two-year-old twin daughters' birthday A 16-year-old boy has been charged with the murder of a father of four who was stabbed to death in the street where he lived. James Gibbons, 34, was attacked at Iris Mews, Laindon, Basildon in Essex, at about 21:30 BST on Sunday. Police believe the self-employed plumber had gone to the aid of another man and died during an argument that followed. The teenager will appear at Chelmsford Magistrates' Court on Friday. Essex Police said it had arrested six teenagers as part of the investigation. A 13-year-old boy arrested on suspicion of murder and a 14-year-old boy held in connection with Mr Gibbons' death have been released on bail. Another 13-year-old boy has been released on bail in connection with an assault, while two girls, aged 15 and 16, arrested on suspicion of murder will not face charges, officers said. Flowers have been left near where James Gibbons was attacked Earlier on Sunday Mr Gibbons had celebrated his two-year-old twin daughters' birthday at home, his family said. In a statement released through Essex Police, they said: ""We are absolutely broken beyond belief at this pointless loss which has had a devastating effect on us all. ""James was the kind of person who would always be prepared to help anyone less fortunate than himself, which is what he was doing on Sunday night.""

When will we know the result of the Scottish election?,"As always, one of the biggest counts will be at the Emirates Arena in Glasgow - but it will be staggered over two days Scots have cast their ballots in the Holyrood election, but don't need to stay up all night as Covid-19 restrictions have put paid to the usual overnight count. With votes to be tallied across Friday and Saturday, when will you know theresult in your local area- and when will the overall winners be declared? Counting will kick off from 09:00 on Friday morning, with the Electoral Management Board projecting 48 of the 73 constituencies to be tallied that day. The full lists can be foundhere, or you can look up your local results here: A modern browser with JavaScript and a stable internet connection is required to view this interactive.More information about these elections Enter your postcode, or the name of your English council or Scottish or Welsh constituency to find out. Eg 'W1A 1AA' or 'Westminster'   Friday's constituencies include both the most marginal and safest seats from 2016, and eight of the SNP's top 10 target seats. These include the Labour defences ofDumbarton, Edinburgh SouthernandEast Lothian, none of which have a majority exceeding 3%, and the Conservative seats inAyr, Edinburgh Central,DumfriesshireandEastwood. If the SNP manage to pick off the lion's share of these seats, they will feel good about going into Saturday and winning a majority. As always, one of the biggest counts will be at the Emirates Arena in Glasgow - but it will be staggered over two days This will particularly be the case if they can gain ground without suffering defeats in any of their own more marginal seats -Angus North & Mearns, MorayandPerthshire Northare those with single-digit majorities. The reverse is also true of course - if the SNP struggle to gain many of these marginal seats or lose some of their own, the path to a majority narrows. By the end of Friday, it should be fairly clear which way the wind is blowing - but there will still be plenty to play for on Saturday. If all goes well on Friday, the remaining 25 constituencies will count on Saturday - with the most marginal contests being between the SNP and Conservatives. The most marginal constituencies to count on Saturday are again SNP-Tory contests, with the SNP hoping to pick offAberdeenshire WestandGalloway&West Dumfries, both with majorities under 5%. It is not yet clear how Covid-safe protocols will affect the speed of counting There are a few chances for the Tories to fight back too, with the SNP defences ofPerthshire South& Kinross-shire,Edinburgh PentlandsandAberdeen SouthandNorth Kincardineall having single-digit majorities. Once each region has declared all of its constituencies, we will also start to get results from the regional lists - which could be pivotal for the overall result, as well as questions over who claims second place and the fate of smaller parties. Before we turn to the regional results, a quick note on how they are worked out. Scotland is divided into eight electoral regions, with the 73 constituency seats scattered across them. Each region elects an extra seven MSPs from lists submitted by the parties - voted for via the peach ballot paper - giving a total of 129. This video can not be played Election 2021: How does Scotland's voting system work? The idea of the list system is to make the outcome of the election more proportional. Once the constituency results have been declared, you divide the number of list votes each party has won by the number of seats they have already won in that region, plus one. So if a party has won nine seats in an area already, their list vote tally is divided by 10 - making it 10 times harder for them to win a seat from the lists. There has been particular focus on the list system in 2021 thanks to the emergence of some list-only parties which encourage tactical voting, leading to a debate over whether this is ""gaming the system"" or simply testing the limits of the rules. Timings for the counts remain very much up in the air, given we don't yet know how difficult it will prove to stack up ballots in line with Covid-19 restrictions. But under current plans, with the exception of the big centres of Glasgow and Edinburgh, most of the count centres only have one constituency to finish off on the Saturday. This means they could well finish up quickly - and indeed simultaneously, if there are similar numbers of ballots to count in each constituency. Which regions will declare first? It is hard to say, but theHighlands and Islands- normally one of the last regions to come back in an overnight count due to the vast and varied geography of the area - only has one seat to count on Saturday. Similarly there will only be one seat left to count from theWest Scotlandregion - so it is possible these two will be able to declare their full regional lists first. Other regions have at least a couple of constituencies still to polish off before they can run the equations and calculate list seats.Mid Scotland and Fifecould be next in line with three seats to count, all at separate locations. However, this is largely guesswork, and a lot will depend on how the Covid-safe procedures play out at count centres. There will be four constituencies counting at the Emirates Area in Glasgow on Saturday, and three at Ingliston for the Lothian region. South Scotlandalso has four counts still to run on Saturday, as doesNorth East Scotland- with two of the latter at P&J Live in Aberdeen, which may delay matters from a logistical standpoint.

Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor The national polling puts Conservatives ahead most of the time, but there are matters that exist in local communities which can't be accounted for in national polling. The parties are flying blind this time around. They haven't been able to campaign on the doorstep due to the pandemic. Whether it's Hartlepool's MP or Wakefield's council, the Conservatives are hoping to show they can dig further into territory which would have been alien to them a decade ago. Labour is under pressure to show that under Sir Keir Starmer, they're able to stop the rot. Whether Nicola Sturgeon can achieve an overall majority in Holyrood, then the UK could be headed for another couple of years of very intense constitutional debate. It could very quickly become Boris Johnson's biggest headache. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Two voters in Glasgow North West have said they were temporarily turned away from a polling station because ballot boxes were ""too full"". Nadeem and Joanna Basharat were turned away from Jordanhill Parish Church polling station at 8:30pm, and told to come back later. A steward said ballot box 52 was too full and they were told to come back by 10pm. When they went back to vote, they said the box was still very full. It looked like the papers inside had just been ""pushed down"". A spokesman for Glasgow's Returning Officer said: ""The sheer size of the regional paper meant some ballot boxes became full. We were able to deliver replacement boxes, but in this case some voters were asked to wait outside before voting. ""The presiding officer is confident that all voters who were asked to wait were ultimately able to vote."" Labour and the Conservatives have both sought to play down expectations as the votes begin to be counted. Labour acknowledged the elections would be ""tough"", with a Labour source saying: ""Keir has always been honest about the mountain we must climb to rebuild trust to win the next general election. ""Labour is listening and we will continue to change in order to win back the trust of working people in Britain and their communities."" It's a similar story from the Conservatives. A Tory source said it was ""looking tough in Hartlepool"" as ""Labour have flooded the area with activists"". Conservative staff had been encouraged to use spare time on Thursday evening to make calls for the candidate Jill Mortimer. It was also suggested it was a ""mixed picture"" across the country. Young people aged 16 and 17-years-old could vote in today's Scottish and Welsh elections - but not in England. We spoke to some teenagers in Leeds to see what they thought - and what policies they cared about. This video can not be played Alex ForsythPolitical correspondent The amount of journalists descending on the town of Hartlepool in the past few weeks shows the level of interest in how this town will vote in their by-election. It's a crucial test for Boris Johnson's Conservatives, whether the support they won at the general election in 2019 was a one-off, or if it's something they can sustain. If Labour lose here, a seat they've held for decades, then it will cause questions for Sir Keir Starmer, as well as deeper questions for the party itself. The ballot boxes are coming in now, and we should know the result in the morning. We will soon know if traditional party allegiances are starting to fray. Ballot papers are arriving at the Mill House Leisure Centre in Hartlepool for the counting overnight. We're hoping to be able to report a result at about 04:00 BST. Heavy snowfall reopened the Lake District Ski Club today For pretty obvious reasons, weather can affect turnout on polling day. In 2019,researchers from the University of Reading,externalanalysed turnout for the constituency of Wokingham since 1945. They found:  Scotland has reported wet, cold, windy weather today. Across the highlands of Scotland, there's been heavy snowfall. BBC Weather has reported that in the whole of April, 3mm of rain fell in Leuchars in Scotland, but in the past six days there has been more than 10 times that. And it's been a pretty wet day across much of England, and particularly cold for this time of year. Hywel GriffithBBC News' Wales Correspondent The question in any Welsh election is not if Labour will hold on to power in the Welsh Government, it's more how many seats they will secure. Out of 22 years in power, they've never had an overall majority of the 60 seats in the Senedd. They won 29 seats last time, and the overall assumption this time is that their seats will be decreased a bit, potentially to the low 20s. The Conservatives are feeling pretty confident that they might have secured second place in polling, particularly through Labour-held seats in north east Wales. It's been harder for Plaid Cymru to break through during the pandemic, they've been largely in agreement with Labour's policies over the past year. Their leader, Adam Price, may yet find himself in power if Labour need help to govern during the next Senedd session. Counting won't start until tomorrow. Results should be known by tomorrow night. The polls in the Scottish election have closed and counting will begin from 09:00 GMT on Friday. You can find resultsas they come in here.

been a big set of elections that will take a while to digest. Not least of all
because the counts are going to go on for days. Overnight, the immediate focus
will likely be what's happened in the Hartlepool by-election; it's one of the
few counts taking place in the wee hours. Has Labour held on or will Boris
Johnson have taken another bite out of that so-called ""red wall""? While by-elections aren't exact litmus tests of public opinion, leaders will
inevitably be judged by their party's performance in such a contest. However
given the sheer number of polls in play there will be plenty else to chew over
- locally and nationally - across England, Wales and Scotland. And, of course, the future of the United Kingdom itself has again been up for discussion with
the SNP hoping this election can bolster its case for a further independence
referendum. Unlike a general election tonight there will no big, instantaneous
exit poll. This bumper set of elections is going to require a bit of patience
as we wait for results to roll in. It's 22:00 BST - and that means the polls are closed. The last of the votes have been cast and the counting (in some places) can now begin. Some contests will declare overnight - including the Hartlepool by-election, while the outcome of Welsh elections should be known by the end ofFriday. The West Midlands mayoral results are expected onSaturdayafternoon and the outcome of the Scottish Parliament results could arrive later that evening. Sunday, at the latest, will bring us London and West Yorkshire mayoral results - as well as more news from the English councils. The final results for police and crime commissioners should arrive byMonday. It's been a challenge for officials and volunteers to get polling stations ready for a safe vote amid the pandemic.

Covid spread in Moray is 'uncontrolled',"NHS Grampian is urging people in Moray to get tested, even if they do not have symptoms Moray is experiencing ""uncontrolled, sustained community transmission"" of Covid-19, public health officials have warned. Chris Littlejohn, deputy director of public health at NHS Grampian, said the situation was ""rapidly deteriorating"". The region currently has an infection rate of more than 81 cases per 100,000 - four times the Scotland-wide level. Mr Littlejohn said there would be deaths if the outbreak could not be controlled. Covid hospital admissions in NHS Grampian have been mainly rising since mid-April. ""We are urging everyone to protect Moray and get tested, even if they have no symptoms,"" Mr Littlejohn said. ""We hope that by intervening further now we can avoid the possibility of further restrictions or a continuation of level three in Moray - but we need to act now and we need the people of Moray to act with us."" Mr Littlejohn said the current Covid restrictions in Moray were not working to contain the number of cases. ""We are seeing hospitalisations from this - including in the under 50s - and we will see deaths, if the situation is not brought under control,"" he said. All of Scotland is due to move to level two on 17 May, but Moraycould remain in level three if cases do not begin to go down. The situation in Moray is a test of Scotland's much enhanced Test and Protect system.  Mobile units and surge testing have been used in other areas but here they are dealing with a series of unrelated clusters and community transmission. Actively encouraging people to come forward will root out cases in asymptomatic people that may previously have gone undetected. It does mean the numbers in Moray are likely to remain higher for a while longer. The key will be how much pressure does it put on hospitals? The vaccine has proven to be effective but there are still many people to get either a first or second dose. Officials will be watching carefully. On Wednesday there were 17 Covid patients in NHS Grampian hospitals - higher than any other health board - though this figure dropped to 11 on Thursday. Health officials have pinpointed Elgin as the ""epicentre"" of the outbreak, but rising levels are also being seen in Lossiemouth, Buckie and Keith. Mobile testing units are being sent to the area and door-to-door testing is being considered in Elgin. Mr Littlejohn added: ""Since 10 April we have seen 210 cases in Moray. More than half of those have come in the last eight days alone. This is a rapidly accelerating situation. ""Test positivity in Moray is at 3.2% - across Scotland that figure is close to just 1% - and the R-rate in Moray is at 1.8, so every person in Moray that becomes infected is, on average, passing it on to two other people."" ""Analytics have shown us many people in the region have returned to their workplaces, rather than working from home. It remains the advice people should work from home where possible and we really need people to do that, where they can."" On Wednesday, NHS Grampian announced that 48 Covid caseswere being linked to Elgin Academy, but parents were assured that it was still safe to send their children there. Jillian Evans, the head of health intelligence at NHS Grampian, said the health board was expecting cases to rise still further in the coming days. She toldBBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programmethat the cases were not the result of just ""one or two people"" not following the guidelines. ""This is something much more widespread in the community which is why we need such targeted action and people to really to take up their guard, to try to do their best particularly as we start to think about easing restrictions further,"" she said. ""When you see a big drop in infection rates it's usually the result of a lockdown situation. We're not talking about doing that, of course not, but we are thinking very carefully about what this means for easing restrictions further. ""It would seem wrong to consider moving down a level while you've got infection rates that continue to rise."" Dr Evans also confirmed that a number of the recent NHS Grampian hospital admissions were Moray residents and that the increase in admissions was ""more than we would expect"". The Moray Chamber of Commerce said the rise in Covid cases was ""worrying"" as businesses in the area were looking forward to a further easing of restrictions. In a statement, the chamber added: ""It is crucial that everyone follows the guidelines to protect the NHS and help to contain and bring the case numbers down so we can move to level two along with the rest of Scotland. ""Being able to trade brings a glimmer of hope that together we can push through this towards something resembling normality."" RULES:What are the restrictions in your area?

Cutting methane gas 'crucial for climate fight'Reducing methane emissions needs to play a much more important role in tackling global warming.,"Methane gas bubbles trapped in a frozen Alaskan lake Reducing emissions of methane gas is vital for tackling climate change in the short-term, a major UN report says. Methane is produced when living things decompose; it's also in natural gas. It persists for just a short time in the atmosphere - unlike carbon dioxide - but methane is a much more potent global warming gas than CO2. The report says ""urgent steps"" are necessary in order to reduce methane if global warming is to be kept within a limit laid down in the Paris deal. This agreement, signed by 200 countries, aims to keep the global temperature rise to within 1.5C above pre-industrial levels by the end of this century. The 1.5C target is regarded as the gateway to ""dangerous"" warming, where the planet could experience serious adverse effects of climate change. Satellites picture methane across the globe Methane pulse detected from South Sudan wetlands Satellite achieves sharp-eyed view of methane The report comes as data showed both CO2 and methane (CH4) in the atmospherereached record highs last year,external. This happened despite pandemic lockdowns, which massively reduced economic activity. The good news is that the UN report says rapid and significant reductions in the greenhouse gas are possible using existing technologies and a very low cost. Methane is also a source for another gas - ozone - in the lowest layer of the Earth's atmosphere (known as the troposphere) In addition to saving money, cutting methane would yield significant health benefits by reducing the amount of ground-level ozone - a pollutant that's harmful to the human body. The recommendations come from an international team of scientists, who have produced the Global Methane Assessment for the UN Environment Programme (Unep). Methane is the major component of natural gas Drew Shindell, the study's lead author, and a professor of Earth science at Duke University in Durham, US, agrees CO2 is the number one target in the fight against climate change, but says cutting methane will have a more rapid impact. ""So many aspects of climate change are happening faster than expected"", he said. ""We see more fires, more of the strongest hurricanes, more heatwaves, and methane is the best lever we have to reduce the growth in those over the next 30 years."" Scientists regard a temperature rise of 1.5C above pre-industrial levels as a gateway to ""dangerous"" warming of the planet. The Paris agreement, signed by nearly 200 countries, aims to keep the increase to within the 1.5C target. The new report says measures available now could reduce emissions from human activities by as much as 180 million tonnes a year by 2030 - 45% of the total per year. The main sources of human-related methane are the fossil fuel industry, which accounts for 34% of total emissions, agriculture which contributes another 40% and the waste sector 20%. One of the difficulties in tackling the methane problem has been knowing precisely where the gas is coming from. But this is changing thanks to an emerging satellite capability that can pinpoint sources. The Canadian company GHGSat has the highest-resolution instrument in orbit currently, able to detect plumes of CH4 down to about 25m across. In the example above, the technology is tracking emissions from a giant landfill area serving the Indonesian capital, Jakarta. The area is outputting 16 tonnes of CH4 every hour, equivalent to nearly 400 tonnes/hr of CO2. On an annualised basis, this is like the greenhouse gas output of 750,000 cars driving for a year. GHGSat's spacecraft are being followed by a fleet of other methane-detecting satellites this decade. Identifying super-emitters is about to get a lot easier. The Unep report says the fossil fuel industry has the greatest potential for low-cost methane cuts. Plugging leaks in oil and gas wells and along production and transmission lines would significantly cut methane emissions at little to no cost, it concludes. Many of the reductions could quickly pay for themselves because reducing leaks means more gas available for sale. But the report warns the continued expansion of the use of natural gas is not compatible with keeping warming to 1.5C without what it calls ""massive-scale deployment of unproven carbon removal technologies"". The waste sector could cut its methane emissions by improving the disposal of sewage around the world. Improving the management of rice paddies has the potential to reduce emissions from agriculture but the report says the biggest generators of agricultural methane - livestock - are harder to abate. This video can not be played Gases produced by livestock are a major factor in global warming, so should we change our eating habits? There is little scope for technical solutions, it concludes, so the effort needs to be focused on reducing food waste and loss, improving livestock management and encouraging consumers to adopt what the report calls ""healthier diets"" - those with a lower meat and dairy content. If a concerted effort managed to achieve that 45% cut in methane emissions, it would help avoid nearly 0.3C of global warming as early as the 2040s, the report claims. Because of methane's contribution to the formation of ozone, up to a quarter of a million premature deaths could be avoided worldwide under the most aggressive emission abatement efforts. This attempt to focus on the issue of methane is very welcome, said Myles Allen, professor of geosystem science at Oxford University, provided it does not distract from the need to reduce CO2 emissions to net zero as soon as possible. Prof Euan Nisbet, from the greenhouse gas group at Royal Holloway, University of London, said: ""The actions it suggests, like cutting gas leaks and landfill emissions, are sensible, cost-effective and economically realistic. If fully implemented, these relatively inexpensive measures will help avoid nearly 0.3C of warming by mid-century.""

UK economy set to grow at fastest rate in 70 years,"The UK economy will enjoy its fastest growth in more than 70 years in 2021 as Covid-19 restrictions are lifted, according to the Bank of England. The economy is expected to expand by 7.25% this year, with extra government spending helping to limit job losses. However, it follows a contraction of 9.9% in 2020, thebiggest in 300 years. Andrew Bailey, the governor of the Bank of England, said the recovery was ""strong"" but likened it to ""more of a bounce back"" than a boom. He added that the surge in growth, while ""good news"", would only return the UK economy back to its 2019 size. Mr Bailey told the BBC: ""We're going to see a continued strong recovery this year, but let's put that into perspective. ""That's two years passed with no growth in the economy."" His comments came as Bank policymakers held interest rates at a record low of 0.1%. The Bank expects the recovery to gather pace as the reopening of high streets paves the way for a mini-spending boom. The UK's rapid vaccine rollout is also expected to boost consumer confidence. Growth of more than 7% this year would represent the strongest expansion since official records began in 1949. Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced in the March Budget that the furlough scheme, which subsidises employees' wages, would beextended until the end of September. Mr Bailey said the extension would limit the rise in unemployment ""significantly"" by providing a ""bridge of support that will last until the recovery is underway"". The Bank now expects the unemployment rate to peak at 5.5% later this year. This is far below the 7.75% it predicted in February. Mr Bailey added: ""Longer term unemployment is one of the most difficult things to deal with. And we think that will be substantially reduced."" The number of people on furlough is expected to fall to 2.75 million in the three months to June, from just under five million at the start of this year. ""Given the expected nearâterm recovery in activity, unemployment is projected to increase only slightly,"" policymakers said in the Bank's latestMonetary Policy Report,external. The Bank of England is trying to play down the idea that there is a post pandemic boom, but nonetheless these are very significant increases to the forecast for economic growth this year, and a substantial cut to predicted peak unemployment. Much of this is ""rebound"" - the natural and obvious result of large swathes of the economy reopening. But the changes indicate the underpinning of a more sustained recovery too. The peak in unemployment has been sharply downgraded, from close to 8% to 5.5%, thanks to the furlough scheme extension, a stronger recovery, and an assumption that the long-term damage from the pandemic will be smaller than previously expected. That means about 700,000 expected job losses not materialising. If this does come to pass, it will far exceed even the most optimistic assumptions from the start of the pandemic crisis. The Bank also assumes that vaccinated Britons feel safer, more confident and are now spending more of the savings arising from a year of lockdowns. There are clear uncertainties, relating to virus variants. But the Bank is at least pointing to a summer recovery, with the economic damage from the pandemic repaired by the end of this year. Households have squirrelled away more than Â£150bn in extra savings over the past year as more people have worked from home, particularly higher earners. The Bank expects them to spend about 10% of this extra cash as the economy returns to normal. However, more than half of those surveyed by the Bank said they would keep the money in savings, suggesting that many households remain cautious about the economic outlook. Policymakers stressed that the outlook ""remains uncertain"" and ""continues to depend on the evolution of the pandemic"". Non-essential shops, pubs and restaurants started reopening last monthas part of a phased easing of restrictionsacross the UK. The Bank's survey of businesses showed that ""footfall increased rapidly in the first few days of trading"", with hairdressers, pubs and restaurants all reporting a surge in bookings. Anecdotal evidence suggested that many people were also opting to take holidays in the UK instead of overseas, with demand ""much higher"" than pre-Covid levels. The Bank also suggested that pay rises were likely to remain subdued this year. While fewer businesses are freezing pay, the Bank said most were awarding increases of between 1.5% and 2%. It added: ""Where bonuses were being paid, these were generally lower than a year ago."" Recent increases in commodity and factory gate prices, combined with record low interest rates, have raised fears of a bigger rise in the price of goods and services. Inflation, as measured by the consumer prices index (CPI),currently stands at 0.7%. However, this is expected to increase sharply towards the Bank's target of 2% in the next few months amid a rise in energy prices. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) that sets interest rates was split on Thursday over the size of its latest round of bond buying, as it announced it will slow the pace of purchases. What is quantitative easing? What does the governor of the Bank of England do? Outgoing chief economist Andy Haldane voted for a reduction in theBank's quantitative easing programmeto guard against the risk of the economy overheating. However, the MPC stressed it would not raise interest rates until there was ""clear evidence"" that the recovery was sustainable.

"Harry and Meghan share birthday picture of ArchieThe son of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, who live in California, turns two today.","The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have shared a picture of their son Archie to mark his second birthday. The sepia-toned picture, taken on Thursday, shows the toddler standing in a garden with his back to the camera, holding a large bunch of balloons. It was shared on theirArchewell website,external, along with a plea for donations to a fund for Covid vaccinations in poor nations. The Queen and other members of the Royal Family sent birthday messages. A message from the Royal Family's official Twitter account,externalsaid: ""Wishing Archie Mountbatten-Windsor a very happy 2nd birthday today."" The post was shared alongside a picture of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex with their son days after he was born. Royal Family tree and line of succession William and Harry seen chatting after funeral Ina statement on their Archewell foundation website,external, Prince Harry and Meghan - who are expecting their second child - said they were ""deeply touched"" by people who had donated to charities in honour of Archie's birthday in previous years. They urged people to support GAVI, the global vaccine alliance, saying: ""We will not be able to truly recover until everyone, everywhere, has equal access to the vaccine. ""We cannot think of a more resonant way to honour our son's birthday. If we all show up, with compassion for those we both know and don't know, we can have a profound impact."" Meanwhile, the duke and duchess also wrote an open letter to major Covid vaccine manufacturers such as Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca, urging them to redouble support for the UN-sponsored Covax programme distributing doses in poorer parts of the world. And asmomentum builds around a US-backed proposal to waive vaccine patents, Harry and Meghan called on the firms to temporarily suspend intellectual property rights on Covid-19 vaccines. Archie lives with his parents in California, following Prince Harry and Meghan's decision to step back as senior royals and move to the US. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, Archie's uncle and aunt, along with his grandparents the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall, also posted birthday messages from their Twitter accounts. Alongside their message, Charles and his wife shared a photo of the Prince of Wales with Harry and Archie at his christening. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Childish Gambino sued over This Is AmericaThe Grammy Award-winning song was copied from an unknown US rapper, he claims in court documents.","This Is America topped the US chart and won the Grammys for both record and song of the year Childish Gambino is being sued for copyright infringement over his Grammy Award-winning rap song This Is America. Emelike Nwosuocha, a rapper who performs as Kidd Wes, claims the song copied his trackMade In America,external, which was released two years earlier. The ""lyrical theme, content and structure"" of the two songs' choruses are ""glaringly similar"", he said in court documents filed in New York. Childish Gambino, aka Donald Glover, has yet to respond to the claims. In 2019,This Is America,externalmade history by becoming the first rap track to win song of the year at the Grammy Awards. One of the most-discussed and powerful songs of the year, it delivered a scathing message about racial inequality, police brutality and gun violence, which was amplified by its provocative music video. However, in court documents, Nwosuocha said there was a ""substantial similarity"" between Glover's track and his own. He claimed the songs shared a ""distinct and unique vocal cadence, delivery, rhythm, timing [and] phrasing"", and noted how the choruses of Made In America and This Is America were written in the same metre. Nwosuocha alleged that the similarity in lyrical content and delivery was ""striking to an extent beyond coincidence"" and ""audible to the average lay person"". The rapper also employed a musicologist to compare the two tracks, who concluded that ""these similarities are likely not coincidences"", the court documents said. This video can not be played 'I choreographed This is America, and this is my story' Nwosuocha is demanding a trial and is seeking damages including lost profits and opportunities. While no sum is mentioned, he claimed that Glover and his co-writers made ""hundreds of millions of dollars"" from This Is America. His legal case also named Childish Gambino's record label, RCA, Roc Nation and Young Thug, who performed backing vocals on the track. Review: Childish Gambino's This is America âââââ Childish Gambino makes Grammys history However, it is not the first time that Glover has been accused of plagiarising This Is America. In 2018, a hip-hop blogger named Akademiks noted a similarity between the song and American Pharaoh by New York rapper Jase Harley. However, Harley said he had no interest in pursuing legal action. ""I feel extremely humbled to be recognised and labelled as one of, or the original inspiration, for one of the most important pieces of music and visual art of our time,"" he posted on Instagram. ""I appreciate all the love and support! But please don't let this controversy dilute the message me and Childish Gambino are trying to convey."" Childish Gambino's manager Fam Udeorji rejected the claims of plagiarism, saying his client's song actually dated back to 2015, ""and we have the Pro Tools [computer] files to prove it"". If so, the song would also pre-date Nwosuocha's Made In America, which he first posted on SoundCloud in September 2016. The BBC has contacted Childish Gambino's team for a response.

Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor The national polling puts Conservatives ahead most of the time, but there are matters that exist in local communities which can't be accounted for in national polling. The parties are flying blind this time around. They haven't been able to campaign on the doorstep due to the pandemic. Whether it's Hartlepool's MP or Wakefield's council, the Conservatives are hoping to show they can dig further into territory which would have been alien to them a decade ago. Labour is under pressure to show that under Sir Keir Starmer, they're able to stop the rot. Whether Nicola Sturgeon can achieve an overall majority in Holyrood, then the UK could be headed for another couple of years of very intense constitutional debate. It could very quickly become Boris Johnson's biggest headache. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Two voters in Glasgow North West have said they were temporarily turned away from a polling station because ballot boxes were ""too full"". Nadeem and Joanna Basharat were turned away from Jordanhill Parish Church polling station at 8:30pm, and told to come back later. A steward said ballot box 52 was too full and they were told to come back by 10pm. When they went back to vote, they said the box was still very full. It looked like the papers inside had just been ""pushed down"". A spokesman for Glasgow's Returning Officer said: ""The sheer size of the regional paper meant some ballot boxes became full. We were able to deliver replacement boxes, but in this case some voters were asked to wait outside before voting. ""The presiding officer is confident that all voters who were asked to wait were ultimately able to vote."" Labour and the Conservatives have both sought to play down expectations as the votes begin to be counted. Labour acknowledged the elections would be ""tough"", with a Labour source saying: ""Keir has always been honest about the mountain we must climb to rebuild trust to win the next general election. ""Labour is listening and we will continue to change in order to win back the trust of working people in Britain and their communities."" It's a similar story from the Conservatives. A Tory source said it was ""looking tough in Hartlepool"" as ""Labour have flooded the area with activists"". Conservative staff had been encouraged to use spare time on Thursday evening to make calls for the candidate Jill Mortimer. It was also suggested it was a ""mixed picture"" across the country. Young people aged 16 and 17-years-old could vote in today's Scottish and Welsh elections - but not in England. We spoke to some teenagers in Leeds to see what they thought - and what policies they cared about. This video can not be played Alex ForsythPolitical correspondent The amount of journalists descending on the town of Hartlepool in the past few weeks shows the level of interest in how this town will vote in their by-election. It's a crucial test for Boris Johnson's Conservatives, whether the support they won at the general election in 2019 was a one-off, or if it's something they can sustain. If Labour lose here, a seat they've held for decades, then it will cause questions for Sir Keir Starmer, as well as deeper questions for the party itself. The ballot boxes are coming in now, and we should know the result in the morning. We will soon know if traditional party allegiances are starting to fray. Ballot papers are arriving at the Mill House Leisure Centre in Hartlepool for the counting overnight. We're hoping to be able to report a result at about 04:00 BST. Heavy snowfall reopened the Lake District Ski Club today For pretty obvious reasons, weather can affect turnout on polling day. In 2019,researchers from the University of Reading,externalanalysed turnout for the constituency of Wokingham since 1945. They found:  Scotland has reported wet, cold, windy weather today. Across the highlands of Scotland, there's been heavy snowfall. BBC Weather has reported that in the whole of April, 3mm of rain fell in Leuchars in Scotland, but in the past six days there has been more than 10 times that. And it's been a pretty wet day across much of England, and particularly cold for this time of year. Hywel GriffithBBC News' Wales Correspondent The question in any Welsh election is not if Labour will hold on to power in the Welsh Government, it's more how many seats they will secure. Out of 22 years in power, they've never had an overall majority of the 60 seats in the Senedd. They won 29 seats last time, and the overall assumption this time is that their seats will be decreased a bit, potentially to the low 20s. The Conservatives are feeling pretty confident that they might have secured second place in polling, particularly through Labour-held seats in north east Wales. It's been harder for Plaid Cymru to break through during the pandemic, they've been largely in agreement with Labour's policies over the past year. Their leader, Adam Price, may yet find himself in power if Labour need help to govern during the next Senedd session. Counting won't start until tomorrow. Results should be known by tomorrow night. The polls in the Scottish election have closed and counting will begin from 09:00 GMT on Friday. You can find resultsas they come in here.

been a big set of elections that will take a while to digest. Not least of all
because the counts are going to go on for days. Overnight, the immediate focus
will likely be what's happened in the Hartlepool by-election; it's one of the
few counts taking place in the wee hours. Has Labour held on or will Boris
Johnson have taken another bite out of that so-called ""red wall""? While by-elections aren't exact litmus tests of public opinion, leaders will
inevitably be judged by their party's performance in such a contest. However
given the sheer number of polls in play there will be plenty else to chew over
- locally and nationally - across England, Wales and Scotland. And, of course, the future of the United Kingdom itself has again been up for discussion with
the SNP hoping this election can bolster its case for a further independence
referendum. Unlike a general election tonight there will no big, instantaneous
exit poll. This bumper set of elections is going to require a bit of patience
as we wait for results to roll in. It's 22:00 BST - and that means the polls are closed. The last of the votes have been cast and the counting (in some places) can now begin. Some contests will declare overnight - including the Hartlepool by-election, while the outcome of Welsh elections should be known by the end ofFriday. The West Midlands mayoral results are expected onSaturdayafternoon and the outcome of the Scottish Parliament results could arrive later that evening. Sunday, at the latest, will bring us London and West Yorkshire mayoral results - as well as more news from the English councils. The final results for police and crime commissioners should arrive byMonday. It's been a challenge for officials and volunteers to get polling stations ready for a safe vote amid the pandemic. Measures have included perspex screens and sanitary wipes for booths. The BBC put together a list ofdos, don'ts and coronavirus safety measures here.

At least 25 killed in Rio de Janeiro shootout,"This video can not be played Aerial footage shows suspects of a wanted drug gang trying to escape police At least 25 people including a police officer have been killed in a shootout in Rio de Janeiro, according to local media. The shootout took place during a police operation in a favela in the Jacarezinho area of the city. Police launched the operation after receiving reports that drug traffickers were recruiting children for their gang. Two passengers on a metro train were hit by bullets but survived. Police in the Brazilian city confirmed the death of one of their officers, Inspector Andre Leonardo de Mello Frias. A statement on Facebook said""he honoured the profession he loved and will be missed"".,external Police Chief Ronaldo Oliveira told Reuters news agency that Thursday's raid was ""the largest number of deaths in a police operation in Rio"". From 2019: A 'policy of massacre' in Rio's favelas? Listen to the documentary Lethal force in Rio's favelas Brazil's racial reckoning: 'Black lives matter here, too' According to local news, the gang targeted in this raid engages in drug trafficking, mugging, murders and kidnappings. Television images showed suspects trying to escape across rooftops as police entered the favela. Civil Police showed off weapons and drugs seized during the raid Meanwhile, residents of Jacarezinho have shared accounts of what they witnessed on social media. One resident posted a photo of his blood-covered floor and said two people had died in his house as police chased the criminals. The man, who did not want to give his name, said he would try to move out of the area as soon as possible. ""We're trying to sell the house as fast as possible, we can't continue to live here,"" he said. Other residents said officers had seized their phones, accusing them of warning gang members of the raid. Sociology professor Ignacio Cano from the Laboratory for the Analysis of Violence at Rio State University dismissed the reasons the police gave for the raid: ""To say that drug traffickers recruit children and teenagers to deal drugs is almost laughable because everyone knows that these gangs have minors who work for them. ""To say that you're going to launch a massive raid because you've discovered that traffickers recruit children is a joke,"" he told O Dia newspaper. Rio de Janeiro is one of Brazil's most violent states Rio de Janeiro is one of Brazil's most violent states and vast areas are under the control of criminals, many of them linked to powerful drug-trafficking gangs. Security forces in Brazil have often been accused of excessive use of force against the civilian population during anti-crime operations in major cities. A court ruling last June restricted police action in poor neighbourhoods of Rio during the pandemic unless it was deemed essential. Rio de Janeiro is the city with the biggest percentage of people living in shanty towns in Brazil - 22%. It's a population of 1,3 million, 70% of which are black. Analysis by Camilla Motta, BBC Brasil reporter, Sao Paulo Police operations targeting favelas controlled by drug traffickers are quite common in Rio. This, however, is the deadliest operation since 2016. Since a court ruling last June restricted police action in poor neighbourhoods in Rio, the number of deaths in shootouts in favelas has fallen. In the first month alone, deaths plummeted 70% when compared to the average recorded since 2007, according to the research group Grupo de Estudos dos Novos Ilegalismos, from Universidade Federal Fluminense. The drop was not followed by a rise in crime. In fact, property crimes were down by 40% and homicides by 48%. Researchers argue this shows that police operations are not the best strategy to tackle crime.

EU willing to discuss waiving vaccine patents,"Germany has voiced opposition to a US-backed proposal to waive patents on Covid-19 vaccines, saying they were not hindering production of the jabs. Its government said ""the protection of intellectual property is a source of innovation and must remain so"". The European Union earlier said it was ready to talk about the proposal, and some states gave it their full backing. Supporters of the plan say it will allow more manufactures to produce the life-saving vaccines. They argue that this will increase access to jabs in poorer countries. But opponents, including drug makers, say it may not have the desired effect. Could lifting patents mean Covid vaccines for all? How will we know Covid vaccines are safe? Covid map: Where are cases the highest? The idea was originally proposed by India and South Africa, who have been leading a group of about 60 countries at the World Trade Organization (WTO) -an intergovernmental body that promotes global commerce. The group is pushing for the temporary removal of intellectual property protections on vaccines. The proposal was met with strong opposition from the previous US administration of Donald Trump, as well as the UK and the EU. But it gained momentum this week afterthe US backed it. WTO head Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala told the BBC's Newshour programme that she welcomed US support for the waiver. She said members should negotiate a pragmatic agreement over vaccine production because the current inequity was ""not right"". Ms Okonjo-Iweala acknowledged the shortage of raw materials and technical expertise required on the ground, but said they would need to start somewhere to boost global supplies. Meanwhile in Germany, Health Minister Jens Spahn said the country would allow the AstraZeneca vaccine to be administered to all adults, reversing aprevious decision to restrict the shot to people over the age of 60 because of concerns over rare blood clotsseen in a tiny number of recipients.Â In a statement on Thursday, the German government said the US-backed proposal would have ""significant implications for vaccine production as a whole"". ""The limiting factors in the production of vaccines are the production capacities and the high quality standards and not patents,"" it said, adding that pharmaceutical companies were already working with partners to ramp up manufacturing. Germany is the EU's biggest economic power and home to a major pharmaceutical sector, including BioNTech which developed one of the most widely-used coronavirus vaccines. The remarks by the German government came after European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the bloc was ""ready to discuss"" the proposal on waiving patents. Ms von der Leyen has previously spoken about her opposition to lifting intellectual property rights, telling the New York Times just weeks ago that she was ""not at all a friend of releasing patents"". Ursula von der Leyen said the EU was ""ready to discuss any proposals that address the crisis in an effective and pragmatic manner"" Meanwhile, officials in other member states such as France and Italy gave the proposal their full backing. The issue is reportedly set to be on the agenda at a two-day EU meeting this week. Outside of the EU, Russian President Vladimir Putin said he supported the idea of a waiver. The UK government said it was ""working with WTO members to resolve this issue"" and was ""in discussions with the US and WTO members to facilitate increased production and supply of Covid-19 vaccines"". Intellectual property describes creations, such as inventions, which are protected by patents, copyrights and trademarks. These prevent copying and allow the originator to be financially rewarded. Patents give innovating firms a short-term monopoly on production to cover the costs of development and encourage investment. Biotech firms argue that such protection has provided incentives to produce Covid vaccines in record times. Many developing countries have argued that rules requiring countries to protect patents and other forms of intellectual property are an obstacle to increasing the production of vaccines and other products needed to tackle the pandemic. Calls for a vaccine patent waiver come as lower income countries face acute vaccine shortages. This video can not be played How to tell a Covid-19 vaccine sceptic the facts But opponents, particularly from the industry, have said it will not solve the problem. The head of the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations, Thomas Cueni, told the BBC's Today programme he was ""deeply concerned"" that ""you could compromise the quality and safety of vaccines which we see now"". ""It is shortages and scarcity in the supply chains, which need to be addressed. And it is also right now the disappointing unwillingness of rich countries to early share doses with the poor countries,"" he said. Some experts say pharmaceutical companies would also need to share know-how, such as production techniques, with poorer countries to have any real beneficial effect. Nobody is protected until everyone's protected: on that world and business leaders are agreed. But pharmaceutical companies have called the decision by the US to back the sharing of secret recipes for vaccinations shortsighted, claiming it is understanding the production process that is the real challenge. It is, they say, akin to handing out a recipe without sharing the method or the ingredients, and could lead to quality issues and less efficient production Instead, the UK and the EU have favoured a system of licensing, whereby knowhow is shared and there is more oversight. It is already being done on some cases on a voluntary basis - such as the tie up between Oxford-AstraZeneca and the Serum Institute of India. And that licensing can be made compulsory, although the pharmaceutical companies could then be eligible for compensation. Some trade specialists have speculated that the US might be hoping that, by backing a lifting of patents, manufacturers might be more open to sharing expertise voluntarily - or at least, for a reduced charge.

They urged people to support GAVI, the global vaccine alliance, saying: ""We will not be able to truly recover until everyone, everywhere, has equal access to the vaccine. ""We cannot think of a more resonant way to honour our son's birthday. If we all show up, with compassion for those we both know and don't know, we can have a profound impact."" Meanwhile, the duke and duchess also wrote an open letter to major Covid vaccine manufacturers such as Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca, urging them to redouble support for the UN-sponsored Covax programme distributing doses in poorer parts of the world. And asmomentum builds around a US-backed proposal to waive vaccine patents, Harry and Meghan called on the firms to temporarily suspend intellectual property rights on Covid-19 vaccines. Archie lives with his parents in California, following Prince Harry and Meghan's decision to step back as senior royals and move to the US. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, Archie's uncle and aunt, along with his grandparents the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall, also posted birthday messages from their Twitter accounts.

French fishing boats leave Jersey after protest,"A protest over post-Brexit rights by French fishermen at Jersey's main port has ended, following talks that aimed to resolve the row. About 60 boats protested at St Helier and two Royal Navy ships and two French vessels were sent to the area. French fishermen say their rights are unfairly restricted by licences issued under the Channel Island's new system. Jersey's External Relations Minister Ian Gorst said discussions were ""positive"". However, a spokesman for fishermen from France's Normandy region suggested that no progress had been made during the talks. ""We're getting deeper into deadlock,""  Hugo Lehuby told Reuters news agency. ""Either this gets resolved, or retaliatory measures are taken."" In Brussels, a European Commission spokeswoman said ""additional conditions"" attached to the new licences were a breach of the Brexit trade deal. Meanwhile, No 10 said, in a call with Jersey officials, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had given his ""unequivocal support"" for the island and confirmed that the two Royal Navy vessels would ""remain in place to monitor the situation as a precautionary measure"". What's the fishing row about? Who really owns UK fishing rights? What does the Brexit trade deal mean for fishing? HMS Severn, which has previously been used to shadow Russian navy warships off the English coast, can be seen from the port, sitting off about a mile from where the French boats were protesting. HMS Tamar is nearby and both ships are maintaining a presence and did not intervene in the protest. Shortly after 13:30 BST the two French patrol vessels, police boat Athos and patroller Themis, appeared to be heading south, away from Jersey. By Jean Mackenzie, BBC Europe correspondent, in Carteret port on the Normandy coast As the boats pulled out of this harbour at 02:30 on Thursday morning, the fishermen were prepared for this 15-hour stand-off in the cold and rain. This protest was their plan to get noticed and it worked. Yes they are angry, but they are also shaken by these unexpected restrictions and worried about their livelihoods. Some fishermen have only been given permission to fish for a handful of days a year. One fisherman, who catches half his whelks and lobsters along Jersey's shores, told me if he can't get full access to Jersey's waters he will have to sell his boat and change his job. When they returned to the French coast this evening, drenched and exhausted, they were surprisingly upbeat. Talks with Jersey's government did not go well, they said, but they know they have been heard. They are now hopeful their government and Brussels will step in to resolve the issue. They feel their part is done, for now. Earlier, the maritime prefecture of Manche and mer du Nord told the BBC the vessels were on a public service mission to ensure safety. France has threatened to cut off electricity to Jersey, the largest Channel Island and a Crown dependency, located 14 miles (22km) off France. Crown dependencies are not part of the UK, but are defended and represented internationally by the UK government. The boats were protesting against new fishing rules - introduced last week by the Jersey government under the UK-EU Trade and Co-operation Agreement (TCA) - which require French boats to show they have a history of fishing in Jersey's waters. But it has been claimed additional requirements were added without notice. French authorities say ""new technical measures"" had not been communicated to the EU, rendering them ""null and void"". ""We agreed that all sides remain committed to engaging with our partners in the EU and France to resolve the concerns arising from the issuing of fishing licenses under the Trade and Co-operation Agreement, which led to today's protest,"" Jersey's Senator Gorst said. Earlier, Jersey fisherman Loic Farnham said of his French counterparts: ""They are professional fishermen, the same as we all are, we'd like to keep it all amicable so we can have access to the markets and they can carry on earning a living in our waters."" The maritime prefecture of Manche and mer du Nord told the BBC the two French vessels were not on military missions. It said the boats' roles were to stay in French waters and to be near the fisherman in order to ensure safety. An ElysÃ©e source said France was monitoring the situation ""very closely"", adding that it is ""currently calm and we hope that this will remain the case"". ""We want to be able to return to negotiations, that we can obtain the fishing licenses provided for in the agreement."" HMS Tamar is one of two Royal Navy ships that are off the coast of Jersey French fishermen have complained about being prevented from operating in British waters because of difficulties in obtaining licences. Under an agreement with the EU, French boat operators must show a history of fishing in the area to receive a licence for Jersey's waters. But it has been claimed additional requirements were added without notice. Jersey has the sole power to issue the licences, and as of last week all fishing boats were required to have a licence to operate there. On Friday, the Jersey government granted 41 permits to French fishing vessels that are equipped with technology that allows them to be located. But the French government claimed the list of approved ships came with further demands that ""were not arranged or discussed, and which we were not notified about"". Chris Le Masurier, who runs Jersey Oyster and Normandy Trader Freight, said the French fisherman were rightly upset by the situation. He said: ""I see it as very much an insult to them and they are extremely upset. The criteria that they were given was to prove they have fished in Jersey waters for 10 days. Nothing about what species were caught, nothing about if you've fished for 20 days or 30 days [and having to] prove that."" But Don Thompson, from the Jersey Fisherman's Association, said affected French crews have ""had since 1 January"" to comply with the new rules and ""perhaps some of the boats that perhaps didn't qualify are a little bit put-out"". Thethreat to cut off Jersey's electricity supply- 95% of which is delivered by three underwater cables from France - was made by French Maritime Minister Annick Girardin on Tuesday. HMS Severn and HMS Tamar, which are based in Portsmouth, are each crewed by 45 sailors and up to 50 Royal Marines. The ships are routinely used for fisheries protection - with sailors able to board other boats for spot checks. Additional reporting by BBC Jersey's political reporter Freddie Miller. Update: This story has been amended to clarify the specifications of Royal Navy vessels HMS Severn and HMS Tamar.

Here are some of the main headlines we've been covering, from the UK and across the world:  A 62-year-old woman who has been waiting more than a year for heart surgery says shefears her condition has deteriorated. Linda Murray, from Lisburn, was due to have a procedure last January but it was cancelled due to the pandemic. She has been suffering with a mitral valve prolapse for eight years. Ms Murray said: ""I have been called for the pre-operative assessment a few times and then I have been mentally preparing myself for the surgery only for it not to happen, which is tough to deal with. ""The condition means I am incredibly tired. Some days all I can do is work and sleep because it takes so much out of me. ""It is now at the stage where we won't know if I will need a full valve replacement or repair until the surgeon begins operating. ""My cardiologist and the hospital staff have been incredible but it's the system that's the problem."" Northern Ireland's Health Minister Robin Swann said waiting lists had been ""unacceptable"" for some time. There were 90 people waiting more than six months for cardiac surgery at the end of 2020 compared to three people for the same period in 2019, according to figures from the British Heart Foundation.  Four St Johnstone players will miss Sunday's Scottish Cup semi-final with St Mirren after two members of the team tested positive for Covid-19 and two were advised to isolate. The two told to isolate later tested negative and the latest round of tests were all negative.

""However, we wish all of them well and their health and wellbeing will always be our priority. We will keep our supporters updated if we need to share further information."" Read more. The number of UK Covid deaths is continuing to fall, according to the latest weekly data. The average number of daily deaths now stands at 12. While the average number of daily cases is also showing a downward trend - the numbers have started to level off. Meanwhile, the number of patients being treated for Covid in hospital is now at the lowest level since mid-September. The NHS isrevising the booking system for Covid-19 jabsin England after complaints that it could reveal individuals' vaccination status. By entering details such as their name, date of birth and postcode it may be possible to work out if another person has been given both doses, one or none. Privacy campaigners Big Brother Watch called it a ""shocking failure"". But NHS Digital said the system had no direct access to medical records and allowed millions to quickly book jabs. The website allows people to book appointments without using their NHS number, by entering their name, date of birth and postcode. But it gives different results depending on whether the individual has already had two doses, one or none, allowing a user to determine other people's vaccination status. The flaw in the website was first revealed by the Guardian,external, which said it could allow employers to monitor their workers' vaccination status - or put people at risk of peer pressure from anti-vaccination friends and colleagues not to get the jab. NHS Digital said it was revising the messages used by the booking system to improve privacy, but suggested that conclusions about someone's vaccine status from entering other people's data would not always be accurate. Shruti MenonBBC Reality Check, Delhi There are signs Covid infections have slowed in some regions of India - but is the country past the worst? India's surge in infections began around mid-March and soon increased rapidly. It reached a peak of more than 400,000 recorded daily cases on 30 April. Over subsequent days the numbers fell, with just under 360,000 on Monday 3 May - leading to speculation that a peak had been reached. But in the past few days, they have started to rise again, in line with a weekly pattern of fluctuations that shows the numbers usually dipping on a Monday. Find out more here. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Official
statistics indicate that230 million domestic trips were made during,externalthe public holiday in China between 1 and 5 May - with media praising the figures as an indication that the public are
confident in the country's full recovery from Covid-19. Since 22 April, there have
been no new domestic cases, and for a good month, there have been none outside
the city of Ruili,Chinaâs
only recent, domestic outbreak. Papers have been highlighting howChinaâs
rail network has seen record passenger numbers,externalthat even surpass
pre-pandemic levels, andthat the tourism
industry has also seen ârobust recoveryâ,external. Nevertheless, there is still an element of post-holiday caution. One of
Chinaâs top epidemiologists, Wu Zunyou, has remindedpeople that they should now
self-isolate,externalas a precaution for 14 days if they have travelled, advice
that was given ahead of the holidays. A Sina Entertainment poll has also found thata large majority of 19,000 voting
netizens indicated they didnât travel anywhere,external, even for a day trip. There is concern at the moment that the rising number of cases in India
could spill over into the country. The Ruili outbreak last month was believed
to have entered via Myanmar, which borders China. And the Global Times has noted thatmany countries bordering both
India and China, like Nepal, have seen a recent spike in cases,external. Obese men are at a greater risk of severe Covid-19 and death than obese women, research has suggested. The data found that obese men with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or more had a ""significant association with higher in-hospital mortality"" - while for women, those with that link had a BMI of 40 or more. Researchers also found that obesity may be a stronger risk factor for severe Covid pneumonia and the need for a ventilator in men than in women. The study looked at data from 3,530 patients in hospital with Covid-19. It was carried out by a team at Montefiore Medical Centre in the Bronx, New York, with patients admitted from 10 March to 1 May last year. The authors of the study, published in the European Journal of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, suggested obesity could lead to poor Covid outcomes due to factors including poorer lung function and increased work of breathing. In Belgium, where some lockdown measures have recently been eased, outdoor dining at bars and restaurants is due to resume from 8 May. And while the country's nationwide curfew will officially be lifted on Saturday, it will still apply for two hours between 22:00 (20:00 GMT) and
midnight in the Brussels region on Friday. In the regions of Flanders and Wallonia, where the curfew currently comes into force at midnight, the rule will no longer apply from this weekend. But in the capital, Brussels, where the curfew is stricter and comes into effect earlier, it will still apply on Friday evening, before expiring at midnight when Saturday officially starts. In practice, this means that Brussels residents will have to be indoors by 22:00 on Friday, but will be able to go out again after midnight. âThis is a Belgian joke, and not even a good one,âBrussels MP Gilles Verstraeten said on Flemish radio on Thursday,external. âMy tolerance limit for such absurdities has reached its lowest point by now.â From Saturday, the curfew will be replaced by a ban on gatherings of more than three people (with an exception for larger households) from midnight to 05:00 across the country. Schools have reopened and a ban on non-essential travel was lifted in April. Hairdressers and other businesses are also open. With a population of 11.5 million, Belgium has recorded more than one million coronavirus cases and more than 24,000 deaths. More than 16m UK adults have now had a second Covid vaccination. The latest government figures show 404,226 people received a second jab on Wednesday, taking the total number to 16,291,719. Another 139,097 adults had their first vaccination - bringing that measurement to 34,934,171. In total 66.3% of adults have had their first jab, and 30.9% both doses. Pope Francis has urged medics in India to stay strong as he sent his support to the country, which is battling a Covid crisis. He sent a message to the Catholic Bishops' Conference in India, offering his ""heartfelt solidarity and spiritual closeness to all the Indian people"". ""My thoughts go above all to the sick and their families, to those who care for them, and in particular to those who are mourning the loss of their loved ones,"" he said. ""I think too of the many doctors, nurses, hospital workers, ambulance drivers and those working tirelessly to respond to the immediate needs of their brothers and sisters."" India reported almost 4,000 more Covid-related deaths on Thursday and more than 412,000 infections, Reuters news agency said. Almost three-quarters of people in England aged 45 to 49 are likely to have had their first dose of Covid vaccine, NHS England said. An estimated 74.7% of people in this age group had been given their first dose as of 2 May. Vaccine appointments in Englandare now opento everyone aged 40 and over. The NHS figures also suggest 89.5% of people aged 50 to 54 have had their first dose. That rises to 95.3% among 55 to 59-year-olds, 98% of 60 to 64-year-olds and 94.4% of 65 to 69-year-olds. The highest proportion is among people aged 70 and above, with 97.7% having had a first dose. Read more:When will I get the vaccine? The UK has reported a further 2,613 Covid cases. There were also 13 deaths within 28 days of a positive test, the latest government figures show. This compares to 2,144 cases and 27 deaths on Wednesday. Overall, the statistics show cases and deaths have continued a downward week-on-week trend. Faisal Islam and Ramzan KarmaliBBC News The governor of the Bank of England says that the central bank's growth forecast of 7.25% this year doesn't represent a boom - but more a bounce back. Andrew Bailey insists this is still good news, and says that the country is going to see a strong recovery this year. However, he warned that by the end of this year, output in the economy ""will be back to where it was the end of 2019"" and we should always remember we've had an economy with no growth for two years. The Bank now expects the unemployment rate to peak at 5.5% later this year - far below the 7.75% it predicted in February. Mr Bailey welcomed the revised forecast, and explained that fewer people will pass through unemployment before they can get jobs again, due to ongoing support. He also says he expects confidence to grow as more people are vaccinated. Maddy SavageBBC News, Stockholm Mass vaccination of Sweden's general population is expected to start later this month More than one in 10 Swedes have now
tested positive for Covid-19 since the start of the pandemic; in other words,
one million out of the countryâs small population of ten million. However, many epidemiologists believe the true figure is likely to be much higher, since testing rates were
low during the first wave, and Sweden doesnât have a national test-and-trace
app. The country has been struggling
to contain its third wave of coronavirus infections, and currently has one of
the highest rates of infection in the EU, with 675 cases per 100,000 residents. However, Swedenâs Public Health Agency says it is starting to detect a downward
trend in cases. The agencyâs head, Johan Carlsson, told a news conference earlier
that he expects case numbers to return to low levels in July and August, as
long as vaccination rates continue and Swedes follow ongoing social distancing
recommendations. So far, only those over 60 or in
risk groups have been vaccinated, with mass vaccination of the general
population expected to start later this month. Seven confirmed cases of the India variant of coronavirus have been found in Northern Ireland, the Department of Health has said. They are the first confirmed cases of the variant in the region. ""This news is not entirely unexpected and plans are in place for such an eventuality,"" chief medical officer Dr Michael McBride said. ""While preventative measures - including travel restrictions - are very important, the assessment is that these will delay rather than permanently prevent the spread of variants already detected elsewhere on these islands."" He says confirmation of these cases does not mean this variant is going to become the most prevalent or the dominant strain in Northern Ireland. ""It does, however, highlight why caution is still essential in relation to Covid-19,"" he added. The UK and the European Union have stopped short of backing calls from the United States for international rules that protect the patents on coronavirus vaccines to be waived. They've pledged instead to work with the World Trade Organization to improve the availability of vaccines. It comes after the US threw its support behind the move to temporarily lift the patent protection. India and South Africa proposed the plan, which they said would increase vaccine production around the world. But drugs manufacturers argue it may not have the desired effect. A UK government spokesperson said the UK was ""working with WTO members to resolve this issue"" and was ""in discussions with the US and WTO members to facilitate increased production and supply of Covid-19 vaccines"". They added: ""As one of the biggest donors to Covax [World Health Organization vaccine initiative], we will ensure global access to vaccines and continue to encourage manufacturers to provide their vaccines on a not-for-profit, transparent basis.â Meanwhile, pharmaceutical companies have voiced their opposition to a waiver, insisting that patents are not the primary obstacle, and cautioned that the move could stifle innovation.

Windrush victim wins court fight over family fees,"The court ruled against the home secretary in the case Relatives of a woman caught up in the Windrush scandal can apply for permission to live in Britain without paying thousands of pounds in fees, the High Court has ruled. Charging the family of Lynda Mahabir would be a ""colossal interference"" in her human rights, the court said. The fees would cost more than Â£20,000. This video can not be played Lynda Mahabir: ''It was worth fighting for'' Mrs Mahabir, 52, was unable to live in the UK until 2018 and says the government didn't correctly record her immigration status in the 1970s. Her case was similar to thousands of other Windrush victims. What was the Windrush scandal? Concern over wait for compensation When she was finally able to come to the UK, she risked being separated from her relatives in Trinidad because the family could not afford to pay application fees of nearly Â£23,000, required for permission to join her. Mrs Mahabir took the government to court claiming the financial impact of the fees had separated her from her husband, Winston, and five children. Her lawyers argued this was a breach of her right to family life, and discriminated against her relatives. The Deputy High Court Judge Tim Smith ruled in favour of the family, and against the home secretary. Reacting to the ruling, Mrs Mahabir told the BBC: ""There are things that are worth fighting for and this was one of them. ""The UK is not really a bad place. It's got lots of opportunities, not only for me but for my family also and in my mind it was worth fighting for."" The Home Office says it is currently reviewing its policy for situations where the application fee for relatives can be waived. Mrs Mahabir told the Home Office in emails that finding the money for her family to apply would be a ""daunting task"". ""We have never been separated from each other before,"" she said. ""I would like for them to be given the opportunity to join me here where we can continue to make the positive impact on lives that we come into contact with."" Toufique Hossain, from the firm representing the claimants, said: ""The pain and misery that has been imposed on the Windrush generation is unimaginable. ""The Home Office on one hand commiserates their suffering and yet continues to develop and then defend policies that keep families apart. ""It should pull down, not put up, barriers to Windrush families staying together."" In a statement, a Home Office official said: ""We remain determined to right the wrongs suffered by the Windrush generation."" The official said more than12,500 people had been given new citizenship or had their citizenship confirmed for free under the Windrush scheme. ""We are carefully considering the implications of this judgment and will continue our work to ensure members of the Windrush generation receive the documentation they need, free of charge, in order to live, work and access services in the UK,"" the official added. This video can not be played A look back at life when the Windrush generation arrived in the UK People arriving in the UK between 1948 and 1971 from Caribbean countries have been labelled the Windrush generation. It refers to the ship MV Empire Windrush, which docked in Tilbury on 22 June 1948, bringing workers from Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago and other islands, to help fill post-war UK labour shortages. It is unclear how many people belong to the Windrush generation, but they are thought to be in their thousands. The Home Office kept no record of those granted leave to remain and issued no paperwork - making it is difficult for Windrush arrivals to prove their legal status. In 2010, it destroyed landing cards belonging to Windrush migrants. Because they came from British colonies that were not independent, they believed they were British citizens. Those who lacked documents were told they needed evidence to continue working, get NHS treatment, or even to remain in the UK.

"Murder victim warned police of threats to her lifeMayra Zulfiqar asked for protection in Pakistan less than two weeks before she died, the BBC learns.London","Mayra Zulfiqar, a Belgian national living in London, studied at Middlesex University and went to school in Twickenham A London woman killed in Pakistan had warned police in Lahore her life was in danger less than two weeks before her murder, the BBC has learned. Mayra Zulfiqar, 24, was found in a pool of blood in a flat on Monday. Thirteen days earlier, she had asked police for protection after accusing a man of abducting her at gunpoint. The law graduate had been threatened by two men who both wanted to marry her, according to legal documents seen by the BBC. Pakistani police are conducting a murder inquiry and so far no formal arrests have been made.

In a police report filed on 20 April, Ms Zulfiqar named and accused a man of abducting her at gunpoint and attempting to sexually assault her a few days earlier. She said she managed to run away by alerting bystanders, but the man threatened her, saying ""you won't be able to escape, I will kill you."" Residents in the upmarket street where Ms Zulfiqar was renting the upper portion of a house, said police had previously visited the area looking for CCTV of a car involved in the alleged abduction. A neighbour, talking on condition of anonymity, told the BBC that loud arguments could often be heard from the property, and that on one occasion men brandishing knives had been seen threatening Ms Zulfiqar from the street. Police would not respond to requests for comment on the report. Ms Zulfiqar was found dead on Monday On Monday morning a maid working in the house called the emergency services after discovering Ms Zulfiqar's body. She had been shot twice, and police believe she may have also been strangled. Residents described hearing shouts in the early hours of the morning.

What's fishing row about?,"French fishing boats have been protesting outside the port of St Helier in Jersey, in a dispute over access to waters around the island. France claims that unfair terms have been imposed, and it's threatening to cut off Jersey's electricity supplies in retaliation. The French authorities say new rules governing access for foreign fishing boats to Jersey's territorial waters are unacceptable. Under post-Brexit rules, which came into force this month, 41 licences or permits have been issued to French fishing vessels to operate in Jersey's waters. Access has been granted based on how much fishing they did there between February 2017 and January 2020. But while some French boats have provided comprehensive information about the amount of fishing they have done in the past, others haven't. That means 17 of the 41 boats have been given much less access than they were expecting. If the owners produce more evidence, Jersey says, their licences can be amended to give them more. But France says there was no consultation about other new conditions affecting all boats which, it says, ""were not arranged or discussed, and which we were not notified about"". Royal Navy ships patrolling Jersey amid fishing row Live updates: Latest on protest in St Helier Who really owns UK fishing rights? What does the Brexit trade deal mean for fishing? The Jersey government has added what it calls two ""very minor"" conservation measures to the new access agreement, dealing with dredging and nesting areas. It argues that neither of them are unreasonable. France argues that the new rules create restricted zones, and limit the kind of fishing equipment which can be used. They say many of their local boats could be put out of business, and smaller boats would also be affected. If Jersey's position does not change, France is reserving the right to retaliate. It's worth noting that the current dispute does not involve other Channel Islands, such as Guernsey. France has threatened to cut electricity supplies to Jersey. An estimated 95% of the island's electricity arrives by undersea cables from France, which is only 14 miles away. This may be just tough talk, but France would theoretically be within their rights to take this action. The Brexit deal says that in some cases, both the UK and the EU can respond to a breach of one part of the agreement - eg in fishing - by imposing sanctions in another area (electricity supplies). But they would have to prove that the agreement really had been breached, and that would take some time. Jersey's status is complicated because it is not part of the UK, and it was never part of the European Union. It is what's known as a Crown dependency, which means it has substantial freedom from Westminster, and exercises day-to-day control over its fishing waters. However, the UK government is ultimately responsible for its international relationships. That's why access to fishing waters around the Channel Islands are dealt with specifically in the new UK-EU trade agreement. The European Commission backs France and says the terms of the trade deal are not being respected. The UK says it informed the European Commission about the new licences - but the Commission says this happened only one day before they came into effect, giving no time for any discussion. Many of these technical issues could well be resolved by holding further talks. But negotiations on fishing are always rather fraught. French fishermen protesting off the coast of Jersey The row about access to Jersey waters comes at a sensitive time. More general negotiations are taking place between UK and EU officials about the division of quotas this year for shared fishing stocks. And there have been other protests. Last month French fishermen blocked the French port of Boulogne to try to prevent imports of fish caught by British boats. They were complaining about restricted access to fishing in waters between six and 12 nautical miles from the British coastline, and seeking guarantees that they would be able to unload their catch at British ports.

Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor The national polling puts Conservatives ahead most of the time, but there are matters that exist in local communities which can't be accounted for in national polling. The parties are flying blind this time around. They haven't been able to campaign on the doorstep due to the pandemic. Whether it's Hartlepool's MP or Wakefield's council, the Conservatives are hoping to show they can dig further into territory which would have been alien to them a decade ago. Labour is under pressure to show that under Sir Keir Starmer, they're able to stop the rot. Whether Nicola Sturgeon can achieve an overall majority in Holyrood, then the UK could be headed for another couple of years of very intense constitutional debate. It could very quickly become Boris Johnson's biggest headache. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Two voters in Glasgow North West have said they were temporarily turned away from a polling station because ballot boxes were ""too full"". Nadeem and Joanna Basharat were turned away from Jordanhill Parish Church polling station at 8:30pm, and told to come back later. A steward said ballot box 52 was too full and they were told to come back by 10pm. When they went back to vote, they said the box was still very full. It looked like the papers inside had just been ""pushed down"". A spokesman for Glasgow's Returning Officer said: ""The sheer size of the regional paper meant some ballot boxes became full. We were able to deliver replacement boxes, but in this case some voters were asked to wait outside before voting. ""The presiding officer is confident that all voters who were asked to wait were ultimately able to vote."" Labour and the Conservatives have both sought to play down expectations as the votes begin to be counted. Labour acknowledged the elections would be ""tough"", with a Labour source saying: ""Keir has always been honest about the mountain we must climb to rebuild trust to win the next general election. ""Labour is listening and we will continue to change in order to win back the trust of working people in Britain and their communities."" It's a similar story from the Conservatives. A Tory source said it was ""looking tough in Hartlepool"" as ""Labour have flooded the area with activists"". Conservative staff had been encouraged to use spare time on Thursday evening to make calls for the candidate Jill Mortimer. It was also suggested it was a ""mixed picture"" across the country. Young people aged 16 and 17-years-old could vote in today's Scottish and Welsh elections - but not in England. We spoke to some teenagers in Leeds to see what they thought - and what policies they cared about. This video can not be played Alex ForsythPolitical correspondent The amount of journalists descending on the town of Hartlepool in the past few weeks shows the level of interest in how this town will vote in their by-election. It's a crucial test for Boris Johnson's Conservatives, whether the support they won at the general election in 2019 was a one-off, or if it's something they can sustain. If Labour lose here, a seat they've held for decades, then it will cause questions for Sir Keir Starmer, as well as deeper questions for the party itself. The ballot boxes are coming in now, and we should know the result in the morning. We will soon know if traditional party allegiances are starting to fray. Ballot papers are arriving at the Mill House Leisure Centre in Hartlepool for the counting overnight. We're hoping to be able to report a result at about 04:00 BST. Heavy snowfall reopened the Lake District Ski Club today For pretty obvious reasons, weather can affect turnout on polling day. In 2019,researchers from the University of Reading,externalanalysed turnout for the constituency of Wokingham since 1945. They found:  Scotland has reported wet, cold, windy weather today. Across the highlands of Scotland, there's been heavy snowfall. BBC Weather has reported that in the whole of April, 3mm of rain fell in Leuchars in Scotland, but in the past six days there has been more than 10 times that. And it's been a pretty wet day across much of England, and particularly cold for this time of year. Hywel GriffithBBC News' Wales Correspondent The question in any Welsh election is not if Labour will hold on to power in the Welsh Government, it's more how many seats they will secure. Out of 22 years in power, they've never had an overall majority of the 60 seats in the Senedd. They won 29 seats last time, and the overall assumption this time is that their seats will be decreased a bit, potentially to the low 20s. The Conservatives are feeling pretty confident that they might have secured second place in polling, particularly through Labour-held seats in north east Wales. It's been harder for Plaid Cymru to break through during the pandemic, they've been largely in agreement with Labour's policies over the past year. Their leader, Adam Price, may yet find himself in power if Labour need help to govern during the next Senedd session. Counting won't start until tomorrow. Results should be known by tomorrow night. The polls in the Scottish election have closed and counting will begin from 09:00 GMT on Friday. You can find resultsas they come in here. Counting will start for the Senedd race on Friday morning as well - and the first results for the the 60 constituency and regional seats are expected later in the day. Findthe results here.

been a big set of elections that will take a while to digest. Not least of all
because the counts are going to go on for days. Overnight, the immediate focus
will likely be what's happened in the Hartlepool by-election; it's one of the
few counts taking place in the wee hours. Has Labour held on or will Boris
Johnson have taken another bite out of that so-called ""red wall""? While by-elections aren't exact litmus tests of public opinion, leaders will
inevitably be judged by their party's performance in such a contest. However
given the sheer number of polls in play there will be plenty else to chew over
- locally and nationally - across England, Wales and Scotland. And, of course, the future of the United Kingdom itself has again been up for discussion with
the SNP hoping this election can bolster its case for a further independence
referendum. Unlike a general election tonight there will no big, instantaneous
exit poll. This bumper set of elections is going to require a bit of patience
as we wait for results to roll in. It's 22:00 BST - and that means the polls are closed. The last of the votes have been cast and the counting (in some places) can now begin. Some contests will declare overnight - including the Hartlepool by-election, while the outcome of Welsh elections should be known by the end ofFriday. The West Midlands mayoral results are expected onSaturdayafternoon and the outcome of the Scottish Parliament results could arrive later that evening. Sunday, at the latest, will bring us London and West Yorkshire mayoral results - as well as more news from the English councils. The final results for police and crime commissioners should arrive byMonday. It's been a challenge for officials and volunteers to get polling stations ready for a safe vote amid the pandemic. Measures have included perspex screens and sanitary wipes for booths. The BBC put together a list ofdos, don'ts and coronavirus safety measures here.

What does Brexit mean for fishing?,"France will begin legal action against the UK in January over the issue of post-Brexit fishing licences, according to a French minister. Tensions have been growing between the UK and France, as both sides try to sort out the politically-charged matter of how to agree fishing rights after Brexit. Under a new post-Brexit trade deal (which came into force at the start of 2021), EU members states' boats need licences to fish in UK and Jersey waters and UK boats need them to fish in the waters of EU member states. Licences are granted to boats that can prove they have fished in a particular area between 1 February 2017 and 31 January 2020. Requiring proof in this way is normal practice in fisheries management and there are often disputes about the evidence. Big trawlers will routinely collect this sort of information using data from Automatic Identification Systems. Smaller vessels, which come from French harbours to fish around the Channel Islands, for example, find it more difficult to provide this kind of proof. The UK National Federation of Fisherman's Organisations (NFFO)says that,externalsorting legitimate boats that are struggling to find the necessary evidence from the opportunists trying to take advantage of the situation is a normal exercise ""best done through quiet dialogue and far from excitable politicians"". In October, the UK and Jersey denied licences to dozens of French boats. On 11 December,external, Jersey ministers gave permanent licences to another five French vessels, taking the total number to 130. That leaves 33 vessels which have temporary licences that are due to expire on 31 January 2022, and 54 applications which have been rejected. A British trawler wasseized by Francein October because it was not on an EU list of vessels that had been granted licences to fish in French waters. The UK government said the trawler had been granted a licence but it was unclear why it was not on the list. The vessel wassubsequently released. The dispute is also about licences for small boats to fish in territorial waters between six and 12 nautical miles from Britain. On 15 December,the UK government said,externalit had received 50 applications for French boats under 12 metres to fish in that zone and that it had issued 19 licences. On 1 December,Guernsey announced,externalthat it had issued licences to 40 boats, it had rejected 15 applications and that it would be issuing another three licences ""in due course"". France made various threats about what would happen if more licences were not issued. Subsequently there was what UK Environment Secretary George Eustice called a ""big de-escalation"" of the row with ""constructive talks"" with France. Then, on 19 November, French President Macron told reporters: ""We have not got what we wanted,"" and added: ""We will not yield."" On 26 November, French fishermen took their own action, including blocking access to French ports for British boats and blocking trucks at the Eurotunnel freight terminal. On 23 December, French Europe Minister Clement Beaune told France 2 television that, in early January, France would be taking its complaints to the special tribunal set up as part of the Brexit agreements. The post-Brexit trade deal,externaloutlines new rules on fishing: EU boats will continue to fish in UK waters for some years to come But UK fishing boats will get a greater share of the fish from UK waters That shift in the share will be phased in between 2021 and 2026, with most of the quota transferred in 2021 After that, there'll be annual negotiations to decide how the catch is shared out between the UK and EU The UK would have the right to completely exclude EU boats after 2026 But the EU could respond with taxes on exports of British fish to the EU or by denying UK boats access to EU waters Both sides agreed that 25% of EU boats' fishing rights in UK waters will be transferred to the UK fishing fleet over a period of five years. This is known as the ""adjustment period"", giving EU fleets time to get used to the new arrangements. The EU wanted it to be longer, the UK wanted it to be shorter - it looks like they've met somewhere in the middle, with an end date of 30 June 2026. The EU fishing quota, which is the amount of fish that EU boats are allowed to catch in UK waters, will be reduced by 15% in the first year and 2.5 percentage points each subsequent year. By 2026, it is estimated that UK boats will have access to an extra Â£145m of fishing quota every year. In 2019, British vessels caught 502,000 tonnes of fish, worth around Â£850m, inside UK waters. The document also sets out details of how each species of fish will be shared out between the UK and the EU during the transition. The UK fleet can expect increases in quota for 57 out of the 90 types of fish caught in UK waters every year. But quota shares for some species like Channel cod, of which EU boats (mainly from France) catch more than 90% each year, will remain unchanged. After the end of the adjustment period in June 2026, there will be annual talks to set the amount EU fishing boats can catch in UK waters (and vice versa) and theoretically the UK could decide to completely withdraw access to its waters for EU vessels, although the EU would be likely to restrict access to its markets and fish to UK fishermen. UK fishermen sell a large proportion of their catch to the EU so access to EU markets is important. In 2019, the UK fishing industry exported more than 333,000 tonnes of fish to the EU. That accounted for nearly half of the total catch of the UK fishing fleet and roughly three quarters of total fish exports from the UK. Some parts of the industry - such as shellfish - are totally dependent on such exports. Read more from Reality Check Send us your questions Reality Check: Is Trump right about the Brexit deal?

Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor The national polling puts Conservatives ahead most of the time, but there are matters that exist in local communities which can't be accounted for in national polling. The parties are flying blind this time around. They haven't been able to campaign on the doorstep due to the pandemic. Whether it's Hartlepool's MP or Wakefield's council, the Conservatives are hoping to show they can dig further into territory which would have been alien to them a decade ago. Labour is under pressure to show that under Sir Keir Starmer, they're able to stop the rot. Whether Nicola Sturgeon can achieve an overall majority in Holyrood, then the UK could be headed for another couple of years of very intense constitutional debate. It could very quickly become Boris Johnson's biggest headache. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Heavy snowfall reopened the Lake District Ski Club today For pretty obvious reasons, weather can affect turnout on polling day. In 2019,researchers from the University of Reading,externalanalysed turnout for the constituency of Wokingham since 1945. They found:  Scotland has reported wet, cold, windy weather today. Across the highlands of Scotland, there's been heavy snowfall. BBC Weather has reported that in the whole of April, 3mm of rain fell in Leuchars in Scotland, but in the past six days there has been more than 10 times that. And it's been a pretty wet day across much of England, and particularly cold for this time of year. Hywel GriffithBBC News' Wales Correspondent The question in any Welsh election is not if Labour will hold on to power in the Welsh Government, it's more how many seats they will secure. Out of 22 years in power, they've never had an overall majority of the 60 seats in the Senedd. They won 29 seats last time, and the overall assumption this time is that their seats will be decreased a bit, potentially to the low 20s. The Conservatives are feeling pretty confident that they might have secured second place in polling, particularly through Labour-held seats in north east Wales. It's been harder for Plaid Cymru to break through during the pandemic, they've been largely in agreement with Labour's policies over the past year. Their leader, Adam Price, may yet find himself in power if Labour need help to govern during the next Senedd session. Counting won't start until tomorrow. Results should be known by tomorrow night. The polls in the Scottish election have closed and counting will begin from 09:00 GMT on Friday. You can find resultsas they come in here.

"French fishing boats leave Jersey after protestThe fishermen remain unhappy despite a Jersey official saying talks over access rights were ""positive"".","A protest over post-Brexit rights by French fishermen at Jersey's main port has ended, following talks that aimed to resolve the row. About 60 boats protested at St Helier and two Royal Navy ships and two French vessels were sent to the area. French fishermen say their rights are unfairly restricted by licences issued under the Channel Island's new system. Jersey's External Relations Minister Ian Gorst said discussions were ""positive"". However, a spokesman for fishermen from France's Normandy region suggested that no progress had been made during the talks. ""We're getting deeper into deadlock,""  Hugo Lehuby told Reuters news agency. ""Either this gets resolved, or retaliatory measures are taken."" In Brussels, a European Commission spokeswoman said ""additional conditions"" attached to the new licences were a breach of the Brexit trade deal. Meanwhile, No 10 said, in a call with Jersey officials, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had given his ""unequivocal support"" for the island and confirmed that the two Royal Navy vessels would ""remain in place to monitor the situation as a precautionary measure"". What's the fishing row about? Who really owns UK fishing rights? What does the Brexit trade deal mean for fishing? HMS Severn, which has previously been used to shadow Russian navy warships off the English coast, can be seen from the port, sitting off about a mile from where the French boats were protesting. HMS Tamar is nearby and both ships are maintaining a presence and did not intervene in the protest. Shortly after 13:30 BST the two French patrol vessels, police boat Athos and patroller Themis, appeared to be heading south, away from Jersey. By Jean Mackenzie, BBC Europe correspondent, in Carteret port on the Normandy coast As the boats pulled out of this harbour at 02:30 on Thursday morning, the fishermen were prepared for this 15-hour stand-off in the cold and rain. This protest was their plan to get noticed and it worked. Yes they are angry, but they are also shaken by these unexpected restrictions and worried about their livelihoods. Some fishermen have only been given permission to fish for a handful of days a year. One fisherman, who catches half his whelks and lobsters along Jersey's shores, told me if he can't get full access to Jersey's waters he will have to sell his boat and change his job. When they returned to the French coast this evening, drenched and exhausted, they were surprisingly upbeat. Talks with Jersey's government did not go well, they said, but they know they have been heard. They are now hopeful their government and Brussels will step in to resolve the issue. They feel their part is done, for now. Earlier, the maritime prefecture of Manche and mer du Nord told the BBC the vessels were on a public service mission to ensure safety. France has threatened to cut off electricity to Jersey, the largest Channel Island and a Crown dependency, located 14 miles (22km) off France. Crown dependencies are not part of the UK, but are defended and represented internationally by the UK government. The boats were protesting against new fishing rules - introduced last week by the Jersey government under the UK-EU Trade and Co-operation Agreement (TCA) - which require French boats to show they have a history of fishing in Jersey's waters. But it has been claimed additional requirements were added without notice. French authorities say ""new technical measures"" had not been communicated to the EU, rendering them ""null and void"". ""We agreed that all sides remain committed to engaging with our partners in the EU and France to resolve the concerns arising from the issuing of fishing licenses under the Trade and Co-operation Agreement, which led to today's protest,"" Jersey's Senator Gorst said. Earlier, Jersey fisherman Loic Farnham said of his French counterparts: ""They are professional fishermen, the same as we all are, we'd like to keep it all amicable so we can have access to the markets and they can carry on earning a living in our waters."" The maritime prefecture of Manche and mer du Nord told the BBC the two French vessels were not on military missions. It said the boats' roles were to stay in French waters and to be near the fisherman in order to ensure safety. An ElysÃ©e source said France was monitoring the situation ""very closely"", adding that it is ""currently calm and we hope that this will remain the case"". ""We want to be able to return to negotiations, that we can obtain the fishing licenses provided for in the agreement."" HMS Tamar is one of two Royal Navy ships that are off the coast of Jersey French fishermen have complained about being prevented from operating in British waters because of difficulties in obtaining licences. Under an agreement with the EU, French boat operators must show a history of fishing in the area to receive a licence for Jersey's waters. But it has been claimed additional requirements were added without notice. Jersey has the sole power to issue the licences, and as of last week all fishing boats were required to have a licence to operate there. On Friday, the Jersey government granted 41 permits to French fishing vessels that are equipped with technology that allows them to be located. But the French government claimed the list of approved ships came with further demands that ""were not arranged or discussed, and which we were not notified about"". Chris Le Masurier, who runs Jersey Oyster and Normandy Trader Freight, said the French fisherman were rightly upset by the situation. He said: ""I see it as very much an insult to them and they are extremely upset. The criteria that they were given was to prove they have fished in Jersey waters for 10 days. Nothing about what species were caught, nothing about if you've fished for 20 days or 30 days [and having to] prove that."" But Don Thompson, from the Jersey Fisherman's Association, said affected French crews have ""had since 1 January"" to comply with the new rules and ""perhaps some of the boats that perhaps didn't qualify are a little bit put-out"". Thethreat to cut off Jersey's electricity supply- 95% of which is delivered by three underwater cables from France - was made by French Maritime Minister Annick Girardin on Tuesday. HMS Severn and HMS Tamar, which are based in Portsmouth, are each crewed by 45 sailors and up to 50 Royal Marines.

US vows to respond to 'irresponsible' Russian acts,"The US official made the comments at a meeting with the Ukrainian president in Kyiv on Thursday The US secretary of state has told Russia to cease all ""reckless and aggressive actions"" towards Ukraine. Antony Blinken made the comments during a trip to Kyiv on Thursday where he met top Ukrainian officials. Speaking alongside President Volodymyr Zelensky, he said the US was looking to strengthen security co-operation and assistance between the two countries. The visit comes just weeks after Russia deployed thousands of soldiers close to the Ukrainian border. ""We are aware that Russia has withdrawn some forces from the border... but we also see that significant forces remain there [and] significant equipment remains there,"" Mr Blinken said. The top US diplomat said Washington was ""monitoring the situation very, very closely"". Who is America's new top diplomat? What Biden's foreign policy 'reset' really means America is back, says Blinken He did not provide further details of any additional security support the US was considering. Barbara Plett Usher, the BBC's State Department correspondent, says the visit was intended to signal that Ukraine is a high foreign policy priority for President Joe Biden's administration. Mr Blinken travelled to Ukraine following a meeting of foreign ministers of the G7 group of industrialised nations in London earlier this week. A statement issued after the two-day talks criticised Moscow for its ""irresponsible and destabilising behaviour"", particularly against Ukraine, and for cyber-attacks. Mr Blinken echoed those sentiments on Thursday while appearing alongside President Zelensky, who said his country was under threat from Russian troops massed near its border. The US and Russia have been long-term adversaries and remain far apart on major issues. In February, US President Joe Biden said he had made it clear to Russian President Vladimir Putin ""that the days of the United States rolling over in the face of Russia's aggressive actions [were] over"". But Mr Biden's predecessor, Republican Donald Trump, said during his presidential campaign that he would get along with Mr Putin. He sought to improve ties while in office, a stance at odds with traditional Republican party policy. By Jonah Fisher, BBC Ukraine correspondent After the intrigue, phone calls and blackmail that dominated the Trump administration's dealings with Ukraine - the presidency of Mr Biden was what many Ukrainians wanted. They are hoping for a steady and dependable ally. Mr Trump was impeached in 2019 over allegations he improperly sought help from Ukraine to boost his chances of re-election. He was acquitted, but the saga certainly strained US-Ukraine relations. Mr Blinken has promised to reinvigorate the relationship. He has been keen to stress that the US stood with Ukraine against Russian aggression, and has said that he is looking at ways of strengthening security co-operation. To enhance its security, Ukraine would like to become a member of Nato - a military alliance of countries from Europe and North America. But there was little encouragement on that front, and Mr Blinken simply said that those aspirations had been discussed. Mr Blinken told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme that the US would prefer a ""more stable and predictable relationship"" with Russia, but would respond to reckless or aggressive acts. He said Washington was focused on actions such as the treatment of opposition figure Alexei Navalny, the Solar Winds hack and election interference. He touched on a number of other policy areas in his BBC interview, including Iran and the planned troop withdrawal from Afghanistan. This video can not be played America's top diplomat warns on doing business with China Mr Blinken insisted that the Biden administration was not trying to hold China back on the world stage, but he stressed that Washington was in favour of upholding a rules-based international system. On Afghanistan, Mr Blinken insisted that the US was ""staying in the game"" and would remain engaged with the country despite an earlier announcement that its soldiers would leave by September. Twenty years in Afghanistan - was it worth it? Mr Blinken said regional powers might have to ""step up"" and use their influence and try to keep the country on a positive path. Asked about a possible trade deal with the UK and the situation in Northern Ireland, Mr Blinken said the administration remained very focused on peace in Ireland. The secretary of state said that for President Biden it was important that ""whatever is done, whatever we do, the gains of the Good Friday Agreement are sustained and we have the political and economic well-being of Northern Ireland in mind"". Joe Biden has previously said that Brexit must not endanger the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, which effectively ended Northern Ireland's ""Troubles"". Post-Brexit trade arrangements for Northern Ireland have led to tensions there and contributed to the recent resignation of First Minister Arlene Foster.

Jersey and French fishermen in talks amid protest,"This video can not be played ""They want talks"": The BBC's Robert Hall is at Jersey's St Helier port Jersey officials are meeting French fishermen, who have been protesting over their post-Brexit rights, in an attempt to resolve the dispute. Two Royal Navy ships and two French vessels are patrolling near Jersey while about 60 French and Jersey boats are at the island's St Helier port. French fishermen say their rights are unfairly restricted by licences issued by the island under a new system. No 10 said the PM has been in contact with Jersey officials over the row. HMS Severn, which has previously been used to shadow Russian navy warships off the English coast, can be seen from the port, sitting off about a mile from the French boats. HMS Tamar is nearby and both ships are maintaining a presence and not making any effort to intervene. No 10 said it sent the two navy vessels to ""monitor the situation"", while the maritime prefecture of Manche and mer du Nord told the BBC the two French patrol vessels were on a public service mission to ensure safety. France has threatened to cut off electricity to Jersey, the largest Channel Island and a Crown dependency, located 14 miles (22km) off France. Crown dependencies are not part of the UK, but are defended and represented internationally by the UK government. Live updates: Latest on protest in St Helier What's the fishing row about? The boats are protesting against new fishing rules - introduced last week by the Jersey government under the UK-EU Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA) - which require French boats to show they have a history of fishing in Jersey's waters. But it has been claimed additional requirements were added without notice. French authorities say ""new technical measures"" had not been communicated to the EU, rendering them ""null and void"". ""It's really important that we are able to work with those fishermen to help them provide the necessary evidence so that, if required, their licences can be amended,"" Senator Ian Gorst, Jersey's external relations minister, told BBC News. ""As I've said, it's important that we respond to threats, but the answer to this solution is to continue to talk and diplomacy."" Who really owns UK fishing rights? What does the Brexit trade deal mean for fishing? Jersey fisherman Loic Farnham said of his French counterparts: ""They are professional fishermen, the same as we all are, we'd like to keep it all amicable so we can have access to the markets and they can carry on earning a living in our waters."" An ElysÃ©e source said France was monitoring the situation ""very closely"", adding that it is ""currently calm and we hope that this will remain the case"". ""We want to be able to return to negotiations, that we can obtain the fishing licenses provided for in the agreement."" The maritime prefecture of Manche and mer du Nord told the BBC the two French vessels, police boat Athos and patroller Themis, were not on military missions. It said the boats' roles were to stay in French waters and to be near to the fisherman in order to ensure safety. A European Commission spokeswoman said talks were continuing with the UK. By Freddie Miller, BBC Jersey political reporter In the darkness you could see the lights from boats slowly making their way from the direction of France towards Jersey. They then all gathered outside the St Helier harbour and they stayed there for about half an hour. At about 06:30 BST they started making their way slowly into the harbour. Flares were set off - red flares, orange flares, burning bright. French flags were being flown, there were banners talking about fishing. Meanwhile, on the pier-side where I am, islanders had gathered - probably about 30 in total, including a couple of police officers. Jersey flags had been hung to the railings of the pier, some were waving flags. There were also some Jersey boats in support of the French, flying both French and Jersey flags, and also a couple that were there trying to stop the French from coming into the harbour. Amidst all of this you've got the two navy vessels in the distance - you can just see the outline shadow of them through the mist, just keeping watch of everything. MEP Stephanie Yon-Courtin, a member of the EU fisheries committee, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme said ""all retaliatory measures will be explored"". Of the threats to cut off electricity to Jersey, she said ""these are only words we are not ready for war"". On Thursday morning, Prime Minister Boris Johnson confirmed that the two Royal Navy vessels would ""remain in place to monitor the situation as a precautionary measure"". A statement from the Jersey government read: ""Diplomatic efforts will continue to resolve the outstanding issues relating to fishing licences and to de-escalate the situation."" HMS Tamar is one of two Royal Navy ships that are off the coast of Jersey Their boats were draped with makeshift banners - which read ""en colÃ¨re""- we are angry,writes BBC Europe correspondent Jean Mackenzie, who was with the fishermen as they set off from the French coast. A handful left this small port on the Normandy coast about 02:30, to be joined by dozens more on the way to Jersey. The fishermen seemed more shocked than angry, that their access to waters they have fished in for decades is being challenged. Under the post-Brexit trade deal, Jersey has to allow European vessels into its waters, but they now need licences - but the fishermen say the permits have come with a long list of restrictions that were never agreed. Reacting to the French maritime minister's threat to cut off Jersey's electricity in retaliation - the fishermen were pleased. ""It's good to know our country is on our side,"" they said HMS Severn is one of the two offshore patrol vessels monitoring Jersey waters Dimitri Rogoff, head of fisheries for the Normandy region, said the boats would not try to block St Helier and would return to France in the afternoon, AFP reported. Labour's shadow defence secretary John Healey said the threats were ""completely unreasonable"" and urged the UK government to ""get round the table with French colleagues and authorities in Jersey and sort this issue out"". French fishermen have complained about being prevented from operating in British waters because of difficulties in obtaining licences. Under an agreement with the EU, French boat operators must show a history of fishing in the area to receive a licence for Jersey's waters.

French fishermen leave Jersey port after protest,"A protest over post-Brexit rights by French fishermen at Jersey's main port has ended, following talks that aimed to resolve the row. About 60 boats protested at St Helier and two Royal Navy ships and two French vessels were sent to the area. French fishermen say their rights are unfairly restricted by licences issued under the Channel Island's new system. Jersey's External Relations Minister Ian Gorst said discussions were ""positive"". However, a spokesman for fishermen from France's Normandy region suggested that no progress had been made during the talks. ""We're getting deeper into deadlock,""  Hugo Lehuby told Reuters news agency. ""Either this gets resolved, or retaliatory measures are taken."" In Brussels, a European Commission spokeswoman said ""additional conditions"" attached to the new licences were a breach of the Brexit trade deal. Meanwhile, No 10 said, in a call with Jersey officials, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had given his ""unequivocal support"" for the island and confirmed that the two Royal Navy vessels would ""remain in place to monitor the situation as a precautionary measure"". What's the fishing row about? Who really owns UK fishing rights? What does the Brexit trade deal mean for fishing? HMS Severn, which has previously been used to shadow Russian navy warships off the English coast, can be seen from the port, sitting off about a mile from where the French boats were protesting. HMS Tamar is nearby and both ships are maintaining a presence and did not intervene in the protest. Shortly after 13:30 BST the two French patrol vessels, police boat Athos and patroller Themis, appeared to be heading south, away from Jersey. By Jean Mackenzie, BBC Europe correspondent, in Carteret port on the Normandy coast As the boats pulled out of this harbour at 02:30 on Thursday morning, the fishermen were prepared for this 15-hour stand-off in the cold and rain. This protest was their plan to get noticed and it worked. Yes they are angry, but they are also shaken by these unexpected restrictions and worried about their livelihoods. Some fishermen have only been given permission to fish for a handful of days a year. One fisherman, who catches half his whelks and lobsters along Jersey's shores, told me if he can't get full access to Jersey's waters he will have to sell his boat and change his job. When they returned to the French coast this evening, drenched and exhausted, they were surprisingly upbeat. Talks with Jersey's government did not go well, they said, but they know they have been heard. They are now hopeful their government and Brussels will step in to resolve the issue. They feel their part is done, for now. Earlier, the maritime prefecture of Manche and mer du Nord told the BBC the vessels were on a public service mission to ensure safety. France has threatened to cut off electricity to Jersey, the largest Channel Island and a Crown dependency, located 14 miles (22km) off France.

India Covid aid 'not reaching those in need',"Emergency aid began arriving in Delhi last week As India's devastating Covid-19 crisis mounted last month, countries around the world began sending emergency medical supplies to help stem the surge. Planeloads of ventilators, medicines and oxygen equipment began pouring into India, from countries including the UK and the US, at the start of last week. By Sunday, some 300 tonnes of supplies on 25 flights had arrived at Delhi International Airport alone. But -as cases continue to reach record levels across the country- concerns are mounting about delays in supplying the aid to those most in need. For several days, much of the cargo sat in airport hangars as hospitals called for more support. The supplies did not begin being distributed until as late as Monday evening - more than a week after the first batch of emergency assistance arrived, state officials have told local media. The Indian government has strongly denied there is a delay, issuing a statement on Tuesday evening saying it had introduced a ""streamlined and systematic mechanism"" for distributing the supplies. The health ministry saidin the statement,externalit was ""working 24x7 to fast track and clear the goods"". But on the ground, officials in some of India's worst-hit states told the BBC that they had still not received any supplies. The UK is among countries to send medical supplies to India Kerala - which recorded a record 37,190 new Covid cases earlier this week - had still not received any aid by Wednesday evening, the state's health secretary, Dr Rajan Khobragade, told the BBC. Kerala's chief minister, Prinarayi Vijayan, separatelycalled on India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi to ""urgently"" send Kerala,externalsome of the country's much-needed oxygen imports. He asked that the equipment ""be allotted to Kerala on a priority basis, considering the fact that Kerala has one of the highest active case loads in the country"", in an open letter to Mr Modi on Wednesday. Some healthcare officials claim there has been little to no communication from the central government on how or when they would receive supplies. ""There's still no information about where it is being distributed,"" said Dr Harsh Mahajan, the president of the Healthcare Federation of India, which represents some of the country's biggest private hospitals. ""It seems people don't know - I've tried two or three places and been unable to find out,"" he added. ""It's still not clear."" Some non-governmental groups involved in responding to the crisis also say they are frustrated by an apparent lack of information. ""I don't think anybody has any clarity on where aid is going,"" Pankaj Anand, Oxfam India's director of programme and advocacy, told the BBC. ""There is no tracker on any website giving you an answer."" Why Indian bosses overseas are sending aid India is a Covid disaster - it didn't have to be A visual guide to the Covid crisis in India An alleged absence of information about the relief distribution effort is raising questions - even in foreign donor countries - about where the aid is going. On Friday,the issue was raised at a US state department briefing,external, when a reporter demanded ""accountability for the US taxpayers' money"" being sent to India, and asked if the US government was tracking the aid's whereabouts. ""Rest assured that the United States is committed to making sure that our partners in India are taken care of in this crisis,"" the state department's spokesperson said in response. The BBC asked the UK's Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office if it had any knowledge of where the country's aid - including its shipments of more than 1,000 ventilators - had been distributed. In response the FCDO said ""the UK has been working with the Indian Red Cross and Government of India to ensure transfer of medical equipment from the UK is as efficient as possible"". ""Distribution processes and decisions on exactly where support provided by the UK will be deployed are matters for the Government of India."" Opposition politicians in India have also called for the government to release more information about how its relief effort is going.""We request and demand from the government... Share it with every Indian: Where has this aid come from, and where is it going?"" said Pawan Khera, a spokesperson for the opposition Congress party. ""You owe it to the public."" It took the Indian government seven days to create a ""streamlined mechanism"" to distribute supplies to states, according to the health ministry. India's government says it has introduced a ""streamlined mechanism"" to handle Covid aid It began work on the plan on 26 April, andissued its Standard Operating Procedure (SOP),external- guidelines on how to distribute aid - on 2 May, it said in a press release. It did not say when aid distribution began. Even when shipments land in India, the distribution process is complex - involving various stages, ministries and outside agencies. After relief flights arrive, aid is received by the Indian Red Cross Society, which is responsible for taking it through customs, according to the government's statement. The shipments are then handed over to another agency, HLL Lifecare, which handles the goods and subsequently transports them across the country. Because supplies are arriving in various forms, authorities have to ""unpack [and] repack"" them before they can be dispatched, further slowing the process, the government admits. ""The materials from abroad are currently coming in different numbers, specifications and at different times,"" the government said. ""In many cases the items received are not as per the list, or the quantities differ, which needs reconciling at the airport."" Once the materials are repacked, they are allocated to areas where ""critical care patients load is high and where the need is highest"". Despite the logistical challenges, India's central government says it is ""working 24x7"" to send supplies to strained areas. It said aid had been dispatched to some 38 institutions in 31 states by Tuesday evening. One badly-hit state, Punjab, has received 100 oxygen concentrators and 2,500 doses of the life-saving drug remdesivir, a state official told the BBC on Wednesday. The air force airlifted the ""first batch"" of 450 oxygen cylinders from the UK to Chennai (Madras) in southern Tamil Nadu state on Tuesday, the city's customs authority said on Twitter.

Despite these efforts, India's hospitals are still in dire need of fresh medical supplies - and above all of oxygen. The country reported a record 412,262 new daily coronavirus cases on Thursday and 3,980 virus-related deaths, the health ministry said. India accounted for nearly half of all reported Covid infections across the world last week, and a quarter of all deaths, according to the World Health Organization. Many hospitals remain in urgent need of oxygen supplies Yet some healthcare professionals say what they need most urgently are not the foreign donations, but more on-site oxygen production facilities to be built at hospitals. ""Right now our only problem is oxygen,"" says Dr Mahajan. ""Even if this aid comes or doesn't come, I don't think it's going to make a substantial difference. The oxygen generators will make the difference. That's what is most essential right now."" Two freshly installed medical oxygen plants - producing 1,000 litres per minute - would begin pumping supplies to hundreds of Covid-19 patients in Delhi on Wednesday evening,the health ministry said in a tweet,external.

"US vows to respond to 'irresponsible' Russian actsThe US would prefer more stable and predictable ties with Russia, Antony Blinken tells the BBC.US & Canada","The US official made the comments at a meeting with the Ukrainian president in Kyiv on Thursday The US secretary of state has told Russia to cease all ""reckless and aggressive actions"" towards Ukraine. Antony Blinken made the comments during a trip to Kyiv on Thursday where he met top Ukrainian officials. Speaking alongside President Volodymyr Zelensky, he said the US was looking to strengthen security co-operation and assistance between the two countries. The visit comes just weeks after Russia deployed thousands of soldiers close to the Ukrainian border. ""We are aware that Russia has withdrawn some forces from the border... but we also see that significant forces remain there [and] significant equipment remains there,"" Mr Blinken said. The top US diplomat said Washington was ""monitoring the situation very, very closely"". Who is America's new top diplomat? What Biden's foreign policy 'reset' really means America is back, says Blinken He did not provide further details of any additional security support the US was considering. Barbara Plett Usher, the BBC's State Department correspondent, says the visit was intended to signal that Ukraine is a high foreign policy priority for President Joe Biden's administration. Mr Blinken travelled to Ukraine following a meeting of foreign ministers of the G7 group of industrialised nations in London earlier this week. A statement issued after the two-day talks criticised Moscow for its ""irresponsible and destabilising behaviour"", particularly against Ukraine, and for cyber-attacks. Mr Blinken echoed those sentiments on Thursday while appearing alongside President Zelensky, who said his country was under threat from Russian troops massed near its border. The US and Russia have been long-term adversaries and remain far apart on major issues. In February, US President Joe Biden said he had made it clear to Russian President Vladimir Putin ""that the days of the United States rolling over in the face of Russia's aggressive actions [were] over"". But Mr Biden's predecessor, Republican Donald Trump, said during his presidential campaign that he would get along with Mr Putin. He sought to improve ties while in office, a stance at odds with traditional Republican party policy. By Jonah Fisher, BBC Ukraine correspondent After the intrigue, phone calls and blackmail that dominated the Trump administration's dealings with Ukraine - the presidency of Mr Biden was what many Ukrainians wanted. They are hoping for a steady and dependable ally. Mr Trump was impeached in 2019 over allegations he improperly sought help from Ukraine to boost his chances of re-election. He was acquitted, but the saga certainly strained US-Ukraine relations. Mr Blinken has promised to reinvigorate the relationship. He has been keen to stress that the US stood with Ukraine against Russian aggression, and has said that he is looking at ways of strengthening security co-operation. To enhance its security, Ukraine would like to become a member of Nato - a military alliance of countries from Europe and North America. But there was little encouragement on that front, and Mr Blinken simply said that those aspirations had been discussed. Mr Blinken told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme that the US would prefer a ""more stable and predictable relationship"" with Russia, but would respond to reckless or aggressive acts. He said Washington was focused on actions such as the treatment of opposition figure Alexei Navalny, the Solar Winds hack and election interference. He touched on a number of other policy areas in his BBC interview, including Iran and the planned troop withdrawal from Afghanistan. This video can not be played America's top diplomat warns on doing business with China Mr Blinken insisted that the Biden administration was not trying to hold China back on the world stage, but he stressed that Washington was in favour of upholding a rules-based international system. On Afghanistan, Mr Blinken insisted that the US was ""staying in the game"" and would remain engaged with the country despite an earlier announcement that its soldiers would leave by September. Twenty years in Afghanistan - was it worth it? Mr Blinken said regional powers might have to ""step up"" and use their influence and try to keep the country on a positive path. Asked about a possible trade deal with the UK and the situation in Northern Ireland, Mr Blinken said the administration remained very focused on peace in Ireland. The secretary of state said that for President Biden it was important that ""whatever is done, whatever we do, the gains of the Good Friday Agreement are sustained and we have the political and economic well-being of Northern Ireland in mind"". Joe Biden has previously said that Brexit must not endanger the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, which effectively ended Northern Ireland's ""Troubles"". Post-Brexit trade arrangements for Northern Ireland have led to tensions there and contributed to the recent resignation of First Minister Arlene Foster. Why are there Brexit checks in Northern Ireland? What Biden's foreign policy 'reset' really means Who is America's new top diplomat?

Murder victim warned police of threats to her life,"Mayra Zulfiqar, a Belgian national living in London, studied at Middlesex University and went to school in Twickenham A London woman killed in Pakistan had warned police in Lahore her life was in danger less than two weeks before her murder, the BBC has learned. Mayra Zulfiqar, 24, was found in a pool of blood in a flat on Monday. Thirteen days earlier, she had asked police for protection after accusing a man of abducting her at gunpoint. The law graduate had been threatened by two men who both wanted to marry her, according to legal documents seen by the BBC. Pakistani police are conducting a murder inquiry and so far no formal arrests have been made. Forensic investigations are continuing and it is understood a number of interrogations have been conducted. In a police report filed on 20 April, Ms Zulfiqar named and accused a man of abducting her at gunpoint and attempting to sexually assault her a few days earlier. She said she managed to run away by alerting bystanders, but the man threatened her, saying ""you won't be able to escape, I will kill you."" Residents in the upmarket street where Ms Zulfiqar was renting the upper portion of a house, said police had previously visited the area looking for CCTV of a car involved in the alleged abduction. A neighbour, talking on condition of anonymity, told the BBC that loud arguments could often be heard from the property, and that on one occasion men brandishing knives had been seen threatening Ms Zulfiqar from the street. Police would not respond to requests for comment on the report. Ms Zulfiqar was found dead on Monday On Monday morning a maid working in the house called the emergency services after discovering Ms Zulfiqar's body. She had been shot twice, and police believe she may have also been strangled. Residents described hearing shouts in the early hours of the morning. Ms Zulfiqar had arrived in Pakistan with her parents about two months ago to attend a family wedding. But when they returned to the UK, she decided to stay on in the country. Mourners paid their respects to Ms Zulfiqar at a funeral service in Lahore Ms Zulfiqar's funeral was held in Lahore on Tuesday, attended by her father, who had travelled back to the city. Prayers for the law graduate were also offered near the family home in West London. Ms Zulfiqar was a Belgian national living in London, according to the UK Foreign Office, which has referred her family to Belgian consular services.

Here are some of the main headlines we've been covering, from the UK and across the world:  A 62-year-old woman who has been waiting more than a year for heart surgery says shefears her condition has deteriorated. Linda Murray, from Lisburn, was due to have a procedure last January but it was cancelled due to the pandemic. She has been suffering with a mitral valve prolapse for eight years. Ms Murray said: ""I have been called for the pre-operative assessment a few times and then I have been mentally preparing myself for the surgery only for it not to happen, which is tough to deal with. ""The condition means I am incredibly tired. Some days all I can do is work and sleep because it takes so much out of me. ""It is now at the stage where we won't know if I will need a full valve replacement or repair until the surgeon begins operating. ""My cardiologist and the hospital staff have been incredible but it's the system that's the problem."" Northern Ireland's Health Minister Robin Swann said waiting lists had been ""unacceptable"" for some time. There were 90 people waiting more than six months for cardiac surgery at the end of 2020 compared to three people for the same period in 2019, according to figures from the British Heart Foundation.  Four St Johnstone players will miss Sunday's Scottish Cup semi-final with St Mirren after two members of the team tested positive for Covid-19 and two were advised to isolate. The two told to isolate later tested negative and the latest round of tests were all negative. ""It's very unfortunate for four of our players to miss out on the important game on Sunday,"" St Johnstone said. ""However, we wish all of them well and their health and wellbeing will always be our priority. We will keep our supporters updated if we need to share further information."" Read more.

By entering details such as their name, date of birth and postcode it may be possible to work out if another person has been given both doses, one or none. Privacy campaigners Big Brother Watch called it a ""shocking failure"". But NHS Digital said the system had no direct access to medical records and allowed millions to quickly book jabs. The website allows people to book appointments without using their NHS number, by entering their name, date of birth and postcode. But it gives different results depending on whether the individual has already had two doses, one or none, allowing a user to determine other people's vaccination status. The flaw in the website was first revealed by the Guardian,external, which said it could allow employers to monitor their workers' vaccination status - or put people at risk of peer pressure from anti-vaccination friends and colleagues not to get the jab. NHS Digital said it was revising the messages used by the booking system to improve privacy, but suggested that conclusions about someone's vaccine status from entering other people's data would not always be accurate. Shruti MenonBBC Reality Check, Delhi There are signs Covid infections have slowed in some regions of India - but is the country past the worst? India's surge in infections began around mid-March and soon increased rapidly. It reached a peak of more than 400,000 recorded daily cases on 30 April. Over subsequent days the numbers fell, with just under 360,000 on Monday 3 May - leading to speculation that a peak had been reached. But in the past few days, they have started to rise again, in line with a weekly pattern of fluctuations that shows the numbers usually dipping on a Monday. Find out more here. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Official
statistics indicate that230 million domestic trips were made during,externalthe public holiday in China between 1 and 5 May - with media praising the figures as an indication that the public are
confident in the country's full recovery from Covid-19. Since 22 April, there have
been no new domestic cases, and for a good month, there have been none outside
the city of Ruili,Chinaâs
only recent, domestic outbreak. Papers have been highlighting howChinaâs
rail network has seen record passenger numbers,externalthat even surpass
pre-pandemic levels, andthat the tourism
industry has also seen ârobust recoveryâ,external. Nevertheless, there is still an element of post-holiday caution. One of
Chinaâs top epidemiologists, Wu Zunyou, has remindedpeople that they should now
self-isolate,externalas a precaution for 14 days if they have travelled, advice
that was given ahead of the holidays. A Sina Entertainment poll has also found thata large majority of 19,000 voting
netizens indicated they didnât travel anywhere,external, even for a day trip. There is concern at the moment that the rising number of cases in India
could spill over into the country. The Ruili outbreak last month was believed
to have entered via Myanmar, which borders China. And the Global Times has noted thatmany countries bordering both
India and China, like Nepal, have seen a recent spike in cases,external. Obese men are at a greater risk of severe Covid-19 and death than obese women, research has suggested. The data found that obese men with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or more had a ""significant association with higher in-hospital mortality"" - while for women, those with that link had a BMI of 40 or more. Researchers also found that obesity may be a stronger risk factor for severe Covid pneumonia and the need for a ventilator in men than in women. The study looked at data from 3,530 patients in hospital with Covid-19. It was carried out by a team at Montefiore Medical Centre in the Bronx, New York, with patients admitted from 10 March to 1 May last year. The authors of the study, published in the European Journal of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, suggested obesity could lead to poor Covid outcomes due to factors including poorer lung function and increased work of breathing. In Belgium, where some lockdown measures have recently been eased, outdoor dining at bars and restaurants is due to resume from 8 May. And while the country's nationwide curfew will officially be lifted on Saturday, it will still apply for two hours between 22:00 (20:00 GMT) and
midnight in the Brussels region on Friday. In the regions of Flanders and Wallonia, where the curfew currently comes into force at midnight, the rule will no longer apply from this weekend. But in the capital, Brussels, where the curfew is stricter and comes into effect earlier, it will still apply on Friday evening, before expiring at midnight when Saturday officially starts. In practice, this means that Brussels residents will have to be indoors by 22:00 on Friday, but will be able to go out again after midnight. âThis is a Belgian joke, and not even a good one,âBrussels MP Gilles Verstraeten said on Flemish radio on Thursday,external. âMy tolerance limit for such absurdities has reached its lowest point by now.â From Saturday, the curfew will be replaced by a ban on gatherings of more than three people (with an exception for larger households) from midnight to 05:00 across the country. Schools have reopened and a ban on non-essential travel was lifted in April. Hairdressers and other businesses are also open. With a population of 11.5 million, Belgium has recorded more than one million coronavirus cases and more than 24,000 deaths. More than 16m UK adults have now had a second Covid vaccination. The latest government figures show 404,226 people received a second jab on Wednesday, taking the total number to 16,291,719. Another 139,097 adults had their first vaccination - bringing that measurement to 34,934,171. In total 66.3% of adults have had their first jab, and 30.9% both doses. Pope Francis has urged medics in India to stay strong as he sent his support to the country, which is battling a Covid crisis. He sent a message to the Catholic Bishops' Conference in India, offering his ""heartfelt solidarity and spiritual closeness to all the Indian people"". ""My thoughts go above all to the sick and their families, to those who care for them, and in particular to those who are mourning the loss of their loved ones,"" he said. ""I think too of the many doctors, nurses, hospital workers, ambulance drivers and those working tirelessly to respond to the immediate needs of their brothers and sisters."" India reported almost 4,000 more Covid-related deaths on Thursday and more than 412,000 infections, Reuters news agency said. Almost three-quarters of people in England aged 45 to 49 are likely to have had their first dose of Covid vaccine, NHS England said. An estimated 74.7% of people in this age group had been given their first dose as of 2 May. Vaccine appointments in Englandare now opento everyone aged 40 and over. The NHS figures also suggest 89.5% of people aged 50 to 54 have had their first dose. That rises to 95.3% among 55 to 59-year-olds, 98% of 60 to 64-year-olds and 94.4% of 65 to 69-year-olds. The highest proportion is among people aged 70 and above, with 97.7% having had a first dose. Read more:When will I get the vaccine? The UK has reported a further 2,613 Covid cases. There were also 13 deaths within 28 days of a positive test, the latest government figures show. This compares to 2,144 cases and 27 deaths on Wednesday. Overall, the statistics show cases and deaths have continued a downward week-on-week trend. Faisal Islam and Ramzan KarmaliBBC News The governor of the Bank of England says that the central bank's growth forecast of 7.25% this year doesn't represent a boom - but more a bounce back. Andrew Bailey insists this is still good news, and says that the country is going to see a strong recovery this year. However, he warned that by the end of this year, output in the economy ""will be back to where it was the end of 2019"" and we should always remember we've had an economy with no growth for two years. The Bank now expects the unemployment rate to peak at 5.5% later this year - far below the 7.75% it predicted in February. Mr Bailey welcomed the revised forecast, and explained that fewer people will pass through unemployment before they can get jobs again, due to ongoing support. He also says he expects confidence to grow as more people are vaccinated. Maddy SavageBBC News, Stockholm Mass vaccination of Sweden's general population is expected to start later this month More than one in 10 Swedes have now
tested positive for Covid-19 since the start of the pandemic; in other words,
one million out of the countryâs small population of ten million. However, many epidemiologists believe the true figure is likely to be much higher, since testing rates were
low during the first wave, and Sweden doesnât have a national test-and-trace
app. The country has been struggling
to contain its third wave of coronavirus infections, and currently has one of
the highest rates of infection in the EU, with 675 cases per 100,000 residents. However, Swedenâs Public Health Agency says it is starting to detect a downward
trend in cases. The agencyâs head, Johan Carlsson, told a news conference earlier
that he expects case numbers to return to low levels in July and August, as
long as vaccination rates continue and Swedes follow ongoing social distancing
recommendations. So far, only those over 60 or in
risk groups have been vaccinated, with mass vaccination of the general
population expected to start later this month. Seven confirmed cases of the India variant of coronavirus have been found in Northern Ireland, the Department of Health has said. They are the first confirmed cases of the variant in the region. ""This news is not entirely unexpected and plans are in place for such an eventuality,"" chief medical officer Dr Michael McBride said. ""While preventative measures - including travel restrictions - are very important, the assessment is that these will delay rather than permanently prevent the spread of variants already detected elsewhere on these islands."" He says confirmation of these cases does not mean this variant is going to become the most prevalent or the dominant strain in Northern Ireland. ""It does, however, highlight why caution is still essential in relation to Covid-19,"" he added. The UK and the European Union have stopped short of backing calls from the United States for international rules that protect the patents on coronavirus vaccines to be waived. They've pledged instead to work with the World Trade Organization to improve the availability of vaccines. It comes after the US threw its support behind the move to temporarily lift the patent protection. India and South Africa proposed the plan, which they said would increase vaccine production around the world. But drugs manufacturers argue it may not have the desired effect. A UK government spokesperson said the UK was ""working with WTO members to resolve this issue"" and was ""in discussions with the US and WTO members to facilitate increased production and supply of Covid-19 vaccines"". They added: ""As one of the biggest donors to Covax [World Health Organization vaccine initiative], we will ensure global access to vaccines and continue to encourage manufacturers to provide their vaccines on a not-for-profit, transparent basis.â Meanwhile, pharmaceutical companies have voiced their opposition to a waiver, insisting that patents are not the primary obstacle, and cautioned that the move could stifle innovation.

"Murder victim warned police of threats to her lifeMayra Zulfiqar asked for protection in Pakistan less than two weeks before she died, the BBC learns.LondonQueen wishes great-grandson Archie happy birthdayThe son of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, who live in California, turns two today.UK","Mayra Zulfiqar, a Belgian national living in London, studied at Middlesex University and went to school in Twickenham A London woman killed in Pakistan had warned police in Lahore her life was in danger less than two weeks before her murder, the BBC has learned. Mayra Zulfiqar, 24, was found in a pool of blood in a flat on Monday. Thirteen days earlier, she had asked police for protection after accusing a man of abducting her at gunpoint. The law graduate had been threatened by two men who both wanted to marry her, according to legal documents seen by the BBC. Pakistani police are conducting a murder inquiry and so far no formal arrests have been made. Forensic investigations are continuing and it is understood a number of interrogations have been conducted. In a police report filed on 20 April, Ms Zulfiqar named and accused a man of abducting her at gunpoint and attempting to sexually assault her a few days earlier. She said she managed to run away by alerting bystanders, but the man threatened her, saying ""you won't be able to escape, I will kill you."" Residents in the upmarket street where Ms Zulfiqar was renting the upper portion of a house, said police had previously visited the area looking for CCTV of a car involved in the alleged abduction. A neighbour, talking on condition of anonymity, told the BBC that loud arguments could often be heard from the property, and that on one occasion men brandishing knives had been seen threatening Ms Zulfiqar from the street. Police would not respond to requests for comment on the report. Ms Zulfiqar was found dead on Monday On Monday morning a maid working in the house called the emergency services after discovering Ms Zulfiqar's body. She had been shot twice, and police believe she may have also been strangled. Residents described hearing shouts in the early hours of the morning. Ms Zulfiqar had arrived in Pakistan with her parents about two months ago to attend a family wedding. But when they returned to the UK, she decided to stay on in the country. Mourners paid their respects to Ms Zulfiqar at a funeral service in Lahore Ms Zulfiqar's funeral was held in Lahore on Tuesday, attended by her father, who had travelled back to the city. Prayers for the law graduate were also offered near the family home in West London. Ms Zulfiqar was a Belgian national living in London, according to the UK Foreign Office, which has referred her family to Belgian consular services.

You are not allowed to take photos inside a polling station because the Electoral Commission - which oversees UK elections - says it risks the secrecy of the ballot. The punishment for revealing how someone else voted - even accidentally - is a fine of up to Â£5,000, or six months in prison. People are welcome to take photos outside. You can, but voters are advised not to update their social media accounts inside the polling station. The rules for postal voting are different, so voters can share photos of their own postal ballot paper on social media if they wish. Animals, apart from assistance dogs,are not usually allowed in polling stations.,external However, other dogs can be admitted at the discretion of the local authority. The Electoral Commission says there is nothing in law to prevent someone wearing a political slogan when going into a polling station to vote. However, they should leave immediately afterwards, as campaigning inside polling stations is not allowed. Political discussion is banned inside polling stations. Staff will intervene if they hear any references to candidates or parties. Bringing children to the polling station is encouraged, to help educate them about democracy.

Voting in UK elections is not compulsory. It is entirely up to you whether or not to vote. Some people deliberately spoil their vote - for example, by writing a message on the ballot paper as a protest. These are recorded, but do not count for or against any candidate. If you sign your ballot and your name is identifiable, the vote does not count. Sometimes ""tellers"" stand outside the polling station and ask voters for the number on their polling card. They are volunteers who work for candidates. They use the information to check who has voted, so they can remind people who have not yet done so.

India Covid aid 'not reaching those in need'Emergency relief is flowing into India but concerns are mounting about delays in supply.India,"Emergency aid began arriving in Delhi last week As India's devastating Covid-19 crisis mounted last month, countries around the world began sending emergency medical supplies to help stem the surge. Planeloads of ventilators, medicines and oxygen equipment began pouring into India, from countries including the UK and the US, at the start of last week. By Sunday, some 300 tonnes of supplies on 25 flights had arrived at Delhi International Airport alone. But -as cases continue to reach record levels across the country- concerns are mounting about delays in supplying the aid to those most in need. For several days, much of the cargo sat in airport hangars as hospitals called for more support. The supplies did not begin being distributed until as late as Monday evening - more than a week after the first batch of emergency assistance arrived, state officials have told local media. The Indian government has strongly denied there is a delay, issuing a statement on Tuesday evening saying it had introduced a ""streamlined and systematic mechanism"" for distributing the supplies. The health ministry saidin the statement,externalit was ""working 24x7 to fast track and clear the goods"". But on the ground, officials in some of India's worst-hit states told the BBC that they had still not received any supplies. The UK is among countries to send medical supplies to India Kerala - which recorded a record 37,190 new Covid cases earlier this week - had still not received any aid by Wednesday evening, the state's health secretary, Dr Rajan Khobragade, told the BBC. Kerala's chief minister, Prinarayi Vijayan, separatelycalled on India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi to ""urgently"" send Kerala,externalsome of the country's much-needed oxygen imports. He asked that the equipment ""be allotted to Kerala on a priority basis, considering the fact that Kerala has one of the highest active case loads in the country"", in an open letter to Mr Modi on Wednesday. Some healthcare officials claim there has been little to no communication from the central government on how or when they would receive supplies. ""There's still no information about where it is being distributed,"" said Dr Harsh Mahajan, the president of the Healthcare Federation of India, which represents some of the country's biggest private hospitals. ""It seems people don't know - I've tried two or three places and been unable to find out,"" he added. ""It's still not clear."" Some non-governmental groups involved in responding to the crisis also say they are frustrated by an apparent lack of information. ""I don't think anybody has any clarity on where aid is going,"" Pankaj Anand, Oxfam India's director of programme and advocacy, told the BBC. ""There is no tracker on any website giving you an answer."" Why Indian bosses overseas are sending aid India is a Covid disaster - it didn't have to be A visual guide to the Covid crisis in India An alleged absence of information about the relief distribution effort is raising questions - even in foreign donor countries - about where the aid is going. On Friday,the issue was raised at a US state department briefing,external, when a reporter demanded ""accountability for the US taxpayers' money"" being sent to India, and asked if the US government was tracking the aid's whereabouts. ""Rest assured that the United States is committed to making sure that our partners in India are taken care of in this crisis,"" the state department's spokesperson said in response. The BBC asked the UK's Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office if it had any knowledge of where the country's aid - including its shipments of more than 1,000 ventilators - had been distributed. In response the FCDO said ""the UK has been working with the Indian Red Cross and Government of India to ensure transfer of medical equipment from the UK is as efficient as possible"". ""Distribution processes and decisions on exactly where support provided by the UK will be deployed are matters for the Government of India."" Opposition politicians in India have also called for the government to release more information about how its relief effort is going.""We request and demand from the government... Share it with every Indian: Where has this aid come from, and where is it going?"" said Pawan Khera, a spokesperson for the opposition Congress party. ""You owe it to the public."" It took the Indian government seven days to create a ""streamlined mechanism"" to distribute supplies to states, according to the health ministry. India's government says it has introduced a ""streamlined mechanism"" to handle Covid aid It began work on the plan on 26 April, andissued its Standard Operating Procedure (SOP),external- guidelines on how to distribute aid - on 2 May, it said in a press release. It did not say when aid distribution began. Even when shipments land in India, the distribution process is complex - involving various stages, ministries and outside agencies. After relief flights arrive, aid is received by the Indian Red Cross Society, which is responsible for taking it through customs, according to the government's statement. The shipments are then handed over to another agency, HLL Lifecare, which handles the goods and subsequently transports them across the country. Because supplies are arriving in various forms, authorities have to ""unpack [and] repack"" them before they can be dispatched, further slowing the process, the government admits. ""The materials from abroad are currently coming in different numbers, specifications and at different times,"" the government said. ""In many cases the items received are not as per the list, or the quantities differ, which needs reconciling at the airport."" Once the materials are repacked, they are allocated to areas where ""critical care patients load is high and where the need is highest"". Despite the logistical challenges, India's central government says it is ""working 24x7"" to send supplies to strained areas. It said aid had been dispatched to some 38 institutions in 31 states by Tuesday evening. One badly-hit state, Punjab, has received 100 oxygen concentrators and 2,500 doses of the life-saving drug remdesivir, a state official told the BBC on Wednesday. The air force airlifted the ""first batch"" of 450 oxygen cylinders from the UK to Chennai (Madras) in southern Tamil Nadu state on Tuesday, the city's customs authority said on Twitter.

Despite these efforts, India's hospitals are still in dire need of fresh medical supplies - and above all of oxygen. The country reported a record 412,262 new daily coronavirus cases on Thursday and 3,980 virus-related deaths, the health ministry said. India accounted for nearly half of all reported Covid infections across the world last week, and a quarter of all deaths, according to the World Health Organization. Many hospitals remain in urgent need of oxygen supplies Yet some healthcare professionals say what they need most urgently are not the foreign donations, but more on-site oxygen production facilities to be built at hospitals. ""Right now our only problem is oxygen,"" says Dr Mahajan. ""Even if this aid comes or doesn't come, I don't think it's going to make a substantial difference. The oxygen generators will make the difference. That's what is most essential right now."" Two freshly installed medical oxygen plants - producing 1,000 litres per minute - would begin pumping supplies to hundreds of Covid-19 patients in Delhi on Wednesday evening,the health ministry said in a tweet,external.

Here are some of the main headlines we've been covering, from the UK and across the world:  A 62-year-old woman who has been waiting more than a year for heart surgery says shefears her condition has deteriorated. Linda Murray, from Lisburn, was due to have a procedure last January but it was cancelled due to the pandemic. She has been suffering with a mitral valve prolapse for eight years. Ms Murray said: ""I have been called for the pre-operative assessment a few times and then I have been mentally preparing myself for the surgery only for it not to happen, which is tough to deal with. ""The condition means I am incredibly tired. Some days all I can do is work and sleep because it takes so much out of me. ""It is now at the stage where we won't know if I will need a full valve replacement or repair until the surgeon begins operating. ""My cardiologist and the hospital staff have been incredible but it's the system that's the problem."" Northern Ireland's Health Minister Robin Swann said waiting lists had been ""unacceptable"" for some time. There were 90 people waiting more than six months for cardiac surgery at the end of 2020 compared to three people for the same period in 2019, according to figures from the British Heart Foundation.  Four St Johnstone players will miss Sunday's Scottish Cup semi-final with St Mirren after two members of the team tested positive for Covid-19 and two were advised to isolate. The two told to isolate later tested negative and the latest round of tests were all negative. ""It's very unfortunate for four of our players to miss out on the important game on Sunday,"" St Johnstone said. ""However, we wish all of them well and their health and wellbeing will always be our priority. We will keep our supporters updated if we need to share further information."" Read more. The number of UK Covid deaths is continuing to fall, according to the latest weekly data. The average number of daily deaths now stands at 12. While the average number of daily cases is also showing a downward trend - the numbers have started to level off. Meanwhile, the number of patients being treated for Covid in hospital is now at the lowest level since mid-September. The NHS isrevising the booking system for Covid-19 jabsin England after complaints that it could reveal individuals' vaccination status. By entering details such as their name, date of birth and postcode it may be possible to work out if another person has been given both doses, one or none. Privacy campaigners Big Brother Watch called it a ""shocking failure"". But NHS Digital said the system had no direct access to medical records and allowed millions to quickly book jabs. The website allows people to book appointments without using their NHS number, by entering their name, date of birth and postcode. But it gives different results depending on whether the individual has already had two doses, one or none, allowing a user to determine other people's vaccination status. The flaw in the website was first revealed by the Guardian,external, which said it could allow employers to monitor their workers' vaccination status - or put people at risk of peer pressure from anti-vaccination friends and colleagues not to get the jab. NHS Digital said it was revising the messages used by the booking system to improve privacy, but suggested that conclusions about someone's vaccine status from entering other people's data would not always be accurate. Shruti MenonBBC Reality Check, Delhi There are signs Covid infections have slowed in some regions of India - but is the country past the worst? India's surge in infections began around mid-March and soon increased rapidly. It reached a peak of more than 400,000 recorded daily cases on 30 April. Over subsequent days the numbers fell, with just under 360,000 on Monday 3 May - leading to speculation that a peak had been reached. But in the past few days, they have started to rise again, in line with a weekly pattern of fluctuations that shows the numbers usually dipping on a Monday. Find out more here. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Official
statistics indicate that230 million domestic trips were made during,externalthe public holiday in China between 1 and 5 May - with media praising the figures as an indication that the public are
confident in the country's full recovery from Covid-19. Since 22 April, there have
been no new domestic cases, and for a good month, there have been none outside
the city of Ruili,Chinaâs
only recent, domestic outbreak. Papers have been highlighting howChinaâs
rail network has seen record passenger numbers,externalthat even surpass
pre-pandemic levels, andthat the tourism
industry has also seen ârobust recoveryâ,external. Nevertheless, there is still an element of post-holiday caution. One of
Chinaâs top epidemiologists, Wu Zunyou, has remindedpeople that they should now
self-isolate,externalas a precaution for 14 days if they have travelled, advice
that was given ahead of the holidays. A Sina Entertainment poll has also found thata large majority of 19,000 voting
netizens indicated they didnât travel anywhere,external, even for a day trip. There is concern at the moment that the rising number of cases in India
could spill over into the country. The Ruili outbreak last month was believed
to have entered via Myanmar, which borders China. And the Global Times has noted thatmany countries bordering both
India and China, like Nepal, have seen a recent spike in cases,external. Obese men are at a greater risk of severe Covid-19 and death than obese women, research has suggested. The data found that obese men with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or more had a ""significant association with higher in-hospital mortality"" - while for women, those with that link had a BMI of 40 or more. Researchers also found that obesity may be a stronger risk factor for severe Covid pneumonia and the need for a ventilator in men than in women. The study looked at data from 3,530 patients in hospital with Covid-19. It was carried out by a team at Montefiore Medical Centre in the Bronx, New York, with patients admitted from 10 March to 1 May last year. The authors of the study, published in the European Journal of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, suggested obesity could lead to poor Covid outcomes due to factors including poorer lung function and increased work of breathing. In Belgium, where some lockdown measures have recently been eased, outdoor dining at bars and restaurants is due to resume from 8 May. And while the country's nationwide curfew will officially be lifted on Saturday, it will still apply for two hours between 22:00 (20:00 GMT) and
midnight in the Brussels region on Friday. In the regions of Flanders and Wallonia, where the curfew currently comes into force at midnight, the rule will no longer apply from this weekend. But in the capital, Brussels, where the curfew is stricter and comes into effect earlier, it will still apply on Friday evening, before expiring at midnight when Saturday officially starts. In practice, this means that Brussels residents will have to be indoors by 22:00 on Friday, but will be able to go out again after midnight. âThis is a Belgian joke, and not even a good one,âBrussels MP Gilles Verstraeten said on Flemish radio on Thursday,external. âMy tolerance limit for such absurdities has reached its lowest point by now.â From Saturday, the curfew will be replaced by a ban on gatherings of more than three people (with an exception for larger households) from midnight to 05:00 across the country. Schools have reopened and a ban on non-essential travel was lifted in April. Hairdressers and other businesses are also open. With a population of 11.5 million, Belgium has recorded more than one million coronavirus cases and more than 24,000 deaths. More than 16m UK adults have now had a second Covid vaccination. The latest government figures show 404,226 people received a second jab on Wednesday, taking the total number to 16,291,719. Another 139,097 adults had their first vaccination - bringing that measurement to 34,934,171. In total 66.3% of adults have had their first jab, and 30.9% both doses. Pope Francis has urged medics in India to stay strong as he sent his support to the country, which is battling a Covid crisis. He sent a message to the Catholic Bishops' Conference in India, offering his ""heartfelt solidarity and spiritual closeness to all the Indian people"". ""My thoughts go above all to the sick and their families, to those who care for them, and in particular to those who are mourning the loss of their loved ones,"" he said. ""I think too of the many doctors, nurses, hospital workers, ambulance drivers and those working tirelessly to respond to the immediate needs of their brothers and sisters."" India reported almost 4,000 more Covid-related deaths on Thursday and more than 412,000 infections, Reuters news agency said. Almost three-quarters of people in England aged 45 to 49 are likely to have had their first dose of Covid vaccine, NHS England said. An estimated 74.7% of people in this age group had been given their first dose as of 2 May. Vaccine appointments in Englandare now opento everyone aged 40 and over. The NHS figures also suggest 89.5% of people aged 50 to 54 have had their first dose. That rises to 95.3% among 55 to 59-year-olds, 98% of 60 to 64-year-olds and 94.4% of 65 to 69-year-olds. The highest proportion is among people aged 70 and above, with 97.7% having had a first dose. Read more:When will I get the vaccine? The UK has reported a further 2,613 Covid cases. There were also 13 deaths within 28 days of a positive test, the latest government figures show. This compares to 2,144 cases and 27 deaths on Wednesday. Overall, the statistics show cases and deaths have continued a downward week-on-week trend. Faisal Islam and Ramzan KarmaliBBC News The governor of the Bank of England says that the central bank's growth forecast of 7.25% this year doesn't represent a boom - but more a bounce back. Andrew Bailey insists this is still good news, and says that the country is going to see a strong recovery this year. However, he warned that by the end of this year, output in the economy ""will be back to where it was the end of 2019"" and we should always remember we've had an economy with no growth for two years. The Bank now expects the unemployment rate to peak at 5.5% later this year - far below the 7.75% it predicted in February. Mr Bailey welcomed the revised forecast, and explained that fewer people will pass through unemployment before they can get jobs again, due to ongoing support. He also says he expects confidence to grow as more people are vaccinated. Maddy SavageBBC News, Stockholm Mass vaccination of Sweden's general population is expected to start later this month More than one in 10 Swedes have now
tested positive for Covid-19 since the start of the pandemic; in other words,
one million out of the countryâs small population of ten million. However, many epidemiologists believe the true figure is likely to be much higher, since testing rates were
low during the first wave, and Sweden doesnât have a national test-and-trace
app. The country has been struggling
to contain its third wave of coronavirus infections, and currently has one of
the highest rates of infection in the EU, with 675 cases per 100,000 residents. However, Swedenâs Public Health Agency says it is starting to detect a downward
trend in cases. The agencyâs head, Johan Carlsson, told a news conference earlier
that he expects case numbers to return to low levels in July and August, as
long as vaccination rates continue and Swedes follow ongoing social distancing
recommendations. So far, only those over 60 or in
risk groups have been vaccinated, with mass vaccination of the general
population expected to start later this month. Seven confirmed cases of the India variant of coronavirus have been found in Northern Ireland, the Department of Health has said. They are the first confirmed cases of the variant in the region. ""This news is not entirely unexpected and plans are in place for such an eventuality,"" chief medical officer Dr Michael McBride said. ""While preventative measures - including travel restrictions - are very important, the assessment is that these will delay rather than permanently prevent the spread of variants already detected elsewhere on these islands."" He says confirmation of these cases does not mean this variant is going to become the most prevalent or the dominant strain in Northern Ireland. ""It does, however, highlight why caution is still essential in relation to Covid-19,"" he added. The UK and the European Union have stopped short of backing calls from the United States for international rules that protect the patents on coronavirus vaccines to be waived. They've pledged instead to work with the World Trade Organization to improve the availability of vaccines. It comes after the US threw its support behind the move to temporarily lift the patent protection. India and South Africa proposed the plan, which they said would increase vaccine production around the world. But drugs manufacturers argue it may not have the desired effect. A UK government spokesperson said the UK was ""working with WTO members to resolve this issue"" and was ""in discussions with the US and WTO members to facilitate increased production and supply of Covid-19 vaccines"". They added: ""As one of the biggest donors to Covax [World Health Organization vaccine initiative], we will ensure global access to vaccines and continue to encourage manufacturers to provide their vaccines on a not-for-profit, transparent basis.â Meanwhile, pharmaceutical companies have voiced their opposition to a waiver, insisting that patents are not the primary obstacle, and cautioned that the move could stifle innovation.

"Murder victim warned police of threats to her lifeMayra Zulfiqar asked for protection in Pakistan less than two weeks before she died, the BBC learns.","Mayra Zulfiqar, a Belgian national living in London, studied at Middlesex University and went to school in Twickenham A London woman killed in Pakistan had warned police in Lahore her life was in danger less than two weeks before her murder, the BBC has learned. Mayra Zulfiqar, 24, was found in a pool of blood in a flat on Monday. Thirteen days earlier, she had asked police for protection after accusing a man of abducting her at gunpoint. The law graduate had been threatened by two men who both wanted to marry her, according to legal documents seen by the BBC. Pakistani police are conducting a murder inquiry and so far no formal arrests have been made. Forensic investigations are continuing and it is understood a number of interrogations have been conducted. In a police report filed on 20 April, Ms Zulfiqar named and accused a man of abducting her at gunpoint and attempting to sexually assault her a few days earlier. She said she managed to run away by alerting bystanders, but the man threatened her, saying ""you won't be able to escape, I will kill you."" Residents in the upmarket street where Ms Zulfiqar was renting the upper portion of a house, said police had previously visited the area looking for CCTV of a car involved in the alleged abduction. A neighbour, talking on condition of anonymity, told the BBC that loud arguments could often be heard from the property, and that on one occasion men brandishing knives had been seen threatening Ms Zulfiqar from the street. Police would not respond to requests for comment on the report. Ms Zulfiqar was found dead on Monday On Monday morning a maid working in the house called the emergency services after discovering Ms Zulfiqar's body. She had been shot twice, and police believe she may have also been strangled. Residents described hearing shouts in the early hours of the morning. Ms Zulfiqar had arrived in Pakistan with her parents about two months ago to attend a family wedding. But when they returned to the UK, she decided to stay on in the country. Mourners paid their respects to Ms Zulfiqar at a funeral service in Lahore Ms Zulfiqar's funeral was held in Lahore on Tuesday, attended by her father, who had travelled back to the city. Prayers for the law graduate were also offered near the family home in West London. Ms Zulfiqar was a Belgian national living in London, according to the UK Foreign Office, which has referred her family to Belgian consular services.

"US vows to respond to 'irresponsible' Russian actsThe US would prefer more stable and predictable ties with Russia, Antony Blinken tells the BBC.","The US official made the comments at a meeting with the Ukrainian president in Kyiv on Thursday The US secretary of state has told Russia to cease all ""reckless and aggressive actions"" towards Ukraine. Antony Blinken made the comments during a trip to Kyiv on Thursday where he met top Ukrainian officials. Speaking alongside President Volodymyr Zelensky, he said the US was looking to strengthen security co-operation and assistance between the two countries. The visit comes just weeks after Russia deployed thousands of soldiers close to the Ukrainian border. ""We are aware that Russia has withdrawn some forces from the border... but we also see that significant forces remain there [and] significant equipment remains there,"" Mr Blinken said. The top US diplomat said Washington was ""monitoring the situation very, very closely"". Who is America's new top diplomat? What Biden's foreign policy 'reset' really means America is back, says Blinken He did not provide further details of any additional security support the US was considering. Barbara Plett Usher, the BBC's State Department correspondent, says the visit was intended to signal that Ukraine is a high foreign policy priority for President Joe Biden's administration. Mr Blinken travelled to Ukraine following a meeting of foreign ministers of the G7 group of industrialised nations in London earlier this week. A statement issued after the two-day talks criticised Moscow for its ""irresponsible and destabilising behaviour"", particularly against Ukraine, and for cyber-attacks. Mr Blinken echoed those sentiments on Thursday while appearing alongside President Zelensky, who said his country was under threat from Russian troops massed near its border. The US and Russia have been long-term adversaries and remain far apart on major issues. In February, US President Joe Biden said he had made it clear to Russian President Vladimir Putin ""that the days of the United States rolling over in the face of Russia's aggressive actions [were] over"". But Mr Biden's predecessor, Republican Donald Trump, said during his presidential campaign that he would get along with Mr Putin. He sought to improve ties while in office, a stance at odds with traditional Republican party policy. By Jonah Fisher, BBC Ukraine correspondent After the intrigue, phone calls and blackmail that dominated the Trump administration's dealings with Ukraine - the presidency of Mr Biden was what many Ukrainians wanted. They are hoping for a steady and dependable ally. Mr Trump was impeached in 2019 over allegations he improperly sought help from Ukraine to boost his chances of re-election. He was acquitted, but the saga certainly strained US-Ukraine relations. Mr Blinken has promised to reinvigorate the relationship. He has been keen to stress that the US stood with Ukraine against Russian aggression, and has said that he is looking at ways of strengthening security co-operation. To enhance its security, Ukraine would like to become a member of Nato - a military alliance of countries from Europe and North America. But there was little encouragement on that front, and Mr Blinken simply said that those aspirations had been discussed. Mr Blinken told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme that the US would prefer a ""more stable and predictable relationship"" with Russia, but would respond to reckless or aggressive acts. He said Washington was focused on actions such as the treatment of opposition figure Alexei Navalny, the Solar Winds hack and election interference. He touched on a number of other policy areas in his BBC interview, including Iran and the planned troop withdrawal from Afghanistan. This video can not be played America's top diplomat warns on doing business with China Mr Blinken insisted that the Biden administration was not trying to hold China back on the world stage, but he stressed that Washington was in favour of upholding a rules-based international system. On Afghanistan, Mr Blinken insisted that the US was ""staying in the game"" and would remain engaged with the country despite an earlier announcement that its soldiers would leave by September. Twenty years in Afghanistan - was it worth it? Mr Blinken said regional powers might have to ""step up"" and use their influence and try to keep the country on a positive path. Asked about a possible trade deal with the UK and the situation in Northern Ireland, Mr Blinken said the administration remained very focused on peace in Ireland. The secretary of state said that for President Biden it was important that ""whatever is done, whatever we do, the gains of the Good Friday Agreement are sustained and we have the political and economic well-being of Northern Ireland in mind"". Joe Biden has previously said that Brexit must not endanger the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, which effectively ended Northern Ireland's ""Troubles"". Post-Brexit trade arrangements for Northern Ireland have led to tensions there and contributed to the recent resignation of First Minister Arlene Foster.

Polling station staff can help you, or you can bring someone with you. In England, anyone over the age of 18 can help you cast your vote. They do not need to be eligible to vote in that election. Polling stations should have large-print sample ballot papers and tactile voting devices to help people with visual impairments. You can take your phone into the polling booth to use magnifier or text-to-speech apps, or the phone torch to improve lighting. But you must not take any photos inside the polling station. Voting in UK elections is not compulsory. It is entirely up to you whether or not to vote. Some people deliberately spoil their vote - for example, by writing a message on the ballot paper as a protest. These are recorded, but do not count for or against any candidate. If you sign your ballot and your name is identifiable, the vote does not count. Sometimes ""tellers"" stand outside the polling station and ask voters for the number on their polling card. They are volunteers who work for candidates. They use the information to check who has voted, so they can remind people who have not yet done so. They are allowed to ask for your polling card number, but you do not have to give it to them.

"No full-time return to the office for over a millionThe vast majority of 50 big UK firms say staff will divide time between home and office, BBC research finds.BusinessComments","This video can not be played Tara Tomes, of the East Village PR firm, in Birmingham, explains why she's ditching the office Almost all of 50 of the UK's biggest employers questioned by the BBC have said they do not plan to bring staff back to the office full-time. Some 43 of the firms said they would embrace a mix of home and office working, with staff encouraged to work from home two to three days a week. Four firms said they were keeping the idea of hybrid working, working from home some of the time, under review. Currently,people who can work from home are still advised to do so.,external However, that is likely to change in June when the government hopes to end all social distancing restrictions. ""We're never going to go back to working the way we used to work,"" said Mark Read, chief executive of advertising firm WPP. But the new ways of using the office require careful planning, he told the BBC. ""People are working from home three to four days a week so we probably need 20% less space, but we're not going to do that if everyone's working from home on Mondays and Fridays."" Other companies cite ""smart working"" and ""flexibility"" as reasons for introducing hybrid working, with many suggesting that workers would be able to make their own choices about how often they come into the office. Danny Harmer, chief people officer at insurance giant Aviva - which has 16,000 UK workers - said 95% of its workers said they would like to be able to spend some of their time working flexibly and remotely in different locations. But she said the company had to be mindful that many staff appreciate being in an office, such as those who live alone or do not have a suitable place to work. Recruitment firm Adecco, which has 34,000 workers, said about four-fifths of its staff now work remotely. ""Rather than having pre-set rules we are encouraging our leaders to engage with colleagues to implement strategies that work for their business,"" it said. Can I ask to keep working from home? PwC says start when you like, leave when you like The BBC questioned 50 big employers, ranging from banks to retailers, to get an idea of when workers may return to the office. The firms contacted by the BBC covered 1.1 million workers in the UK. Businesses that depend on custom from office workers - such as cafes and restaurants - are keen for them to return as soon as possible. Joao Almeida, from Panda Cup Coffee, relies on office workers for trade ""We rely really heavily on the office trade,"" Joao Almeida, of Panda Cup Coffee in London's Blackfriars, told the BBC. He was one of millions of people unable to work from home during the pandemic. ""There are locations that have 5,000 people, but only 140 come to the building with most working from home or maybe once a week coming in. That makes it really difficult."" Carl Forder, who owns the Pottergate Pantry sandwich shop in Norwich. saw an 80% drop in business when workers, including 5,000 at the nearby Aviva office, were told to work from home where possible. ""We really hope a lot more office workers return to Norwich when it's safe for them to do so. ""It affects a lot of businesses, from the cleaners who clean the offices, right through to coffee shops and sandwich bars. We want that buzz back again."" But in the financial services industry it can be a problem if people work from home, reckons Andrew Monk, chief executive of investment bank VSA Capital. ""People working from home don't realise it but they're gradually getting slower and slower whereas the people in the office aren't,"" he told BBC Radio Five Live. ""In the financial services industry you need to discuss ideas and discuss what's going on. People working from home miss out on an awful lot of the activity in the office because we don't have time to tell them."" But there may not be a deluge of workers returning this month. The companies told the BBC they were opening offices ""in line with government guidance"", which means many plan to reopen offices from 21 June. Some have already reopened their offices to a limited number of workers. Investment firm JP Morgan and recruiter Michael Page allowed workers to return from 29 March, while Adecco, recruiter Hays Group and WPP reopened offices on 12 April. Investment firm Rathbones has allowed workers to return ""if they wish"", subject to a 25% capacity. WPP reopened its UK offices at a 30% capacity, but is increasing that to 50% this month. Goldman tells bankers to return to office in June KPMG's 16,000 UK staff to get more time off work Nationwide tells 13,000 staff to 'work anywhere' Many have given workers the choice, with Michael Page saying staff could return to the office ""should they choose to do so"". But some other companies are delaying their office re-opening plans. Outsourcing giant Capita said workers have been told they will work from home until at least the end of June, while Lloyds Bank has asked staff to stay at home until at least the summer. David Kimberley: ""It's depressing waking up and commuting to your kitchen."" Tom, who works in property, is not looking forward to going back to the office. The commute is long, expensive, uncomfortable and unnecessary, he told the BBC. ""My office is modern and seemingly comfortable. But the culture can be difficult and the false familiarity is suffocating. It's a petri dish of anxiety and breeding ground of mental health issues."" He says working at home is more comfortable. ""The technology enables a more inclusive mode of working where information is shared more easily and talent can shine. There's also more time for family and more time for real friends."" In contrast, David Kimberley said he ""couldn't wait"". He returned to the stockbroker's office he works at two weeks ago. ""There's something healthy about having a psychological separation between your work and home life. I find that hard to do when I'm working from home,"" he told the BBC. ""There's something quite gloomy, especially in winter, about working from home, and it's depressing waking up and commuting to your kitchen. ""It also makes it much harder to collaborate. I work closely with another member of the team and in the office we can sort things out in seconds, When working from home it can take 10 minutes to get a response, and you have no real idea about how they're feeling as you can't see them to gauge their emotions."" Only a few of the companies surveyed by the BBC have been shutting offices, with some saying they will wait until leases run out. Capita has closed 49 out of 294 of its offices since the start of the pandemic while accountants Deloitte has closed offices at Gatwick, Liverpool, Nottingham and Southampton. Lloyds Bank said it planned to close 20% of its offices over the next three years while NatWest closed its Regent House, London office last summer, in a move that had been planned, but speeded up by the pandemic. Newspaper group Reach has closed its district offices as part of a move to a hub-based model. Meanwhile, Welsh Water closed its head office last year. But not all are keen on the move away from offices. WPP boss Mark Read says he worries about the long-term impact on the company's culture and training. ""Advertising and creative industries are something you learn from your colleagues and you can only do that, really, if you're around them in an office."" Accounting software firm Sage has just opened a new office - planned before the pandemic - which has space for 1,800 people. Sage's chief people officer Amanda Cusdin says that despite using a mix of home and office working going forward, the office will still be needed. ""We know for a lot of people maybe don't have a quiet space to work at home and would rather do it in the office.""

India says new variant linked to Covid surge,"The government's top scientific adviser has warned that a third wave is inevitable India has said a new variant of the coronavirus first discovered there in March may be linked to a deadly second wave. Samples containing the ""double mutant""- or B.1.617 variant - have been found in several states with high case numbers. An official with the National Centre for Disease Control said, however, that they had still been unable to fully establish a correlation. A double mutant is when two mutations come together in the same virus. What is the India Covid variant? India is a Covid disaster - it didn't have to be Meanwhile, India reported a record 412,000 cases in the space of 24 hours on Wednesday, and 3,980 deaths. The government's top scientific adviser also warned a third wave is inevitable. Speaking at a health ministry news briefing, K VijayRaghavan admitted that experts had not anticipated the ""ferocity"" of the surge in cases. ""Phase three is inevitable, given the high levels of circulating virus,"" he added during a news briefing. ""But it is not clear on what timescale this phase three will occur... We should prepare for new waves."" The current surge of the virus has already overwhelmed the healthcare system with hospital beds, oxygen and even crematorium space in short supply. Several states are under localised lockdowns and curfews, but the government is reluctant to impose a national lockdown, for fear of the impact on the economy. Out of roughly 13,000 samples sequenced, more than 3,500 were found to be variants of concern - including B.1.617 - across eight states. The B.1.617 variant was reported in several states reporting surges including Maharashtra, Karnataka, West Bengal, Gujarat and Chhattisgarh. For more than a month, Delhi insisted that the variant had no link to the current surge. Virologist Dr Shahid Jameeltold the BBC's Vikas Pandey earlierthat India started seriously looking at mutations fairly late, with sequencing efforts only ""properly started"" in mid-February 2021. India is sequencing just over 1% of all samples at the moment. ""In comparison, the UK was sequencing at 5-6% at the peak of the pandemic. But you can't build such capacity overnight,"" he said. Indians' desperate wait for Covid jab to get longer US backs waiver on vaccine patents to boost supply And although the central government now says there is a correlation, it added the link is not ""fully established"". ""Its epidemiological and clinical correlation is not fully establishedâ¦ without the correlation, we cannot establish direct linkage to any surge. However, we have advised states to strengthen public health response - increase testing, quick isolation, prevent crowds, vaccination,"" Sujeet Singh, National Centre for Disease Control said. A number of states have reported their highest fatalities in a single day A number of states reported their highest fatalities in a single day on Wednesday - including the northern states of Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Punjab and Tamil Nadu and Karnataka in the south. The western state of Maharashtra, which has had the highest caseload throughout the pandemic, reported 920 deaths. However, experts say the tally could be far higher due to reduced testing, and under-reporting of deaths. In  a weekly report, the World Heath Organization said that India accounted for nearly half the coronavirus cases reported worldwide last week, and a quarter of deaths. Indian delegates in UK for G7 talks self-isolate Covid cases at Everest raise fears of outbreak An Indian delegation that travelled to the G7 Foreign Ministers' meeting in London this week, is self-isolating after two of its members tested positive for Covid-19. India's foreign minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar travelled with the delegation to London, and says he will attend the rest of the summit virtually. India has been unable to meet an ambitious vaccination programme - it initially wanted to vaccinate 300 million people by July - and there's been a dramatic drop in jabs because of a shortage of doses. Just 26 million people out of a population of 1.4 billion have received both shots, and about 129 million have only received a single dose. Vaccine stocks in the country have nearly dried up, with the latest age bracket to become eligible - adults under the age of 45 - struggling to register and secure appointments. Experts say lockdowns and vaccinations are the only way out, but that the government would need to act now in order to break the chain. What is the India Covid variant?

"Coronavirus: Morning updateFive things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Thursday morning.UKNo full-time return to the office for over a millionThe vast majority of 50 big UK firms say staff will divide time between home and office, BBC research finds.Business","Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Thursday morning. We'll have another update for you this evening. Polls have openedon what is the Britain's biggest voting day since the 2019 general election. Many of the elections - on what has been dubbed ""Super Thursday"" - were due to be held last year but the pandemic forced their delay, meaning that more than usual are taking place this time. Elections for the Scottish Parliament, the Welsh Senedd, and 143 councils and 13 mayors in England are happening. A Westminster by-election is also taking place in Hartlepool. TheUS has thrown its support behind an initiative at the World Trade Organizationto waive intellectual property protections for coronavirus vaccines. India and South Africa put forward the proposal to set aside patents on vaccines six months ago, arguing it would increase production around the world. US Trade Representative Katherine Tai said ""extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures"". But pharmaceutical companies insist patents are not the primary obstacle, and cautioned that the move could stifle innovation. Almost all of 50 of the UK's biggest employers questioned by the BBC have said theydo not plan to bring staff back to the office full-time.Some 43 of the firms said they would embrace a mix of home and office working, with staff encouraged to work from home two to three days a week. Four firms said they were keeping the idea of hybrid working, working from home some of the time, under review. Currently, people who can work from home are still advised to do so.

This video can not be played As the pandemic eases, doctors are left to deal with the impact it has had on their mental health. Like many people, Chloe Dickenson's travel plans ground to a halt last year when the world was thrown into lockdown. A so-called ""digital nomad"", the 22-year-old was living and working from her laptop overseas. With improved wi-fi and flexible workspaces across the globe, digital nomadism has boomed over recent years. And while the global travel restrictions have temporarily grounded many such nomads, longer term the movement is expected to grow much further.Read more here.

Danny Harmer, chief people officer at insurance giant Aviva - which has 16,000 UK workers - said 95% of its workers said they would like to be able to spend some of their time working flexibly and remotely in different locations. But she said the company had to be mindful that many staff appreciate being in an office, such as those who live alone or do not have a suitable place to work. Recruitment firm Adecco, which has 34,000 workers, said about four-fifths of its staff now work remotely. ""Rather than having pre-set rules we are encouraging our leaders to engage with colleagues to implement strategies that work for their business,"" it said. Can I ask to keep working from home? PwC says start when you like, leave when you like The BBC questioned 50 big employers, ranging from banks to retailers, to get an idea of when workers may return to the office. The firms contacted by the BBC covered 1.1 million workers in the UK. Businesses that depend on custom from office workers - such as cafes and restaurants - are keen for them to return as soon as possible. Joao Almeida, from Panda Cup Coffee, relies on office workers for trade ""We rely really heavily on the office trade,"" Joao Almeida, of Panda Cup Coffee in London's Blackfriars, told the BBC. He was one of millions of people unable to work from home during the pandemic. ""There are locations that have 5,000 people, but only 140 come to the building with most working from home or maybe once a week coming in. That makes it really difficult."" Carl Forder, who owns the Pottergate Pantry sandwich shop in Norwich. saw an 80% drop in business when workers, including 5,000 at the nearby Aviva office, were told to work from home where possible. ""We really hope a lot more office workers return to Norwich when it's safe for them to do so. ""It affects a lot of businesses, from the cleaners who clean the offices, right through to coffee shops and sandwich bars. We want that buzz back again."" But in the financial services industry it can be a problem if people work from home, reckons Andrew Monk, chief executive of investment bank VSA Capital. ""People working from home don't realise it but they're gradually getting slower and slower whereas the people in the office aren't,"" he told BBC Radio Five Live. ""In the financial services industry you need to discuss ideas and discuss what's going on. People working from home miss out on an awful lot of the activity in the office because we don't have time to tell them."" But there may not be a deluge of workers returning this month. The companies told the BBC they were opening offices ""in line with government guidance"", which means many plan to reopen offices from 21 June. Some have already reopened their offices to a limited number of workers. Investment firm JP Morgan and recruiter Michael Page allowed workers to return from 29 March, while Adecco, recruiter Hays Group and WPP reopened offices on 12 April. Investment firm Rathbones has allowed workers to return ""if they wish"", subject to a 25% capacity. WPP reopened its UK offices at a 30% capacity, but is increasing that to 50% this month. Goldman tells bankers to return to office in June KPMG's 16,000 UK staff to get more time off work Nationwide tells 13,000 staff to 'work anywhere' Many have given workers the choice, with Michael Page saying staff could return to the office ""should they choose to do so"". But some other companies are delaying their office re-opening plans. Outsourcing giant Capita said workers have been told they will work from home until at least the end of June, while Lloyds Bank has asked staff to stay at home until at least the summer. David Kimberley: ""It's depressing waking up and commuting to your kitchen."" Tom, who works in property, is not looking forward to going back to the office. The commute is long, expensive, uncomfortable and unnecessary, he told the BBC. ""My office is modern and seemingly comfortable. But the culture can be difficult and the false familiarity is suffocating. It's a petri dish of anxiety and breeding ground of mental health issues."" He says working at home is more comfortable. ""The technology enables a more inclusive mode of working where information is shared more easily and talent can shine. There's also more time for family and more time for real friends."" In contrast, David Kimberley said he ""couldn't wait"". He returned to the stockbroker's office he works at two weeks ago. ""There's something healthy about having a psychological separation between your work and home life. I find that hard to do when I'm working from home,"" he told the BBC. ""There's something quite gloomy, especially in winter, about working from home, and it's depressing waking up and commuting to your kitchen. ""It also makes it much harder to collaborate. I work closely with another member of the team and in the office we can sort things out in seconds, When working from home it can take 10 minutes to get a response, and you have no real idea about how they're feeling as you can't see them to gauge their emotions."" Only a few of the companies surveyed by the BBC have been shutting offices, with some saying they will wait until leases run out. Capita has closed 49 out of 294 of its offices since the start of the pandemic while accountants Deloitte has closed offices at Gatwick, Liverpool, Nottingham and Southampton. Lloyds Bank said it planned to close 20% of its offices over the next three years while NatWest closed its Regent House, London office last summer, in a move that had been planned, but speeded up by the pandemic. Newspaper group Reach has closed its district offices as part of a move to a hub-based model. Meanwhile, Welsh Water closed its head office last year. But not all are keen on the move away from offices. WPP boss Mark Read says he worries about the long-term impact on the company's culture and training. ""Advertising and creative industries are something you learn from your colleagues and you can only do that, really, if you're around them in an office."" Accounting software firm Sage has just opened a new office - planned before the pandemic - which has space for 1,800 people. Sage's chief people officer Amanda Cusdin says that despite using a mix of home and office working going forward, the office will still be needed. ""We know for a lot of people maybe don't have a quiet space to work at home and would rather do it in the office.""

India's surge in infections began around mid-March and soon increased rapidly. It reached a peak of more than 400,000 recorded daily cases on 30 April. Over subsequent days the numbers fell, with just under 360,000 on Monday 3 May - leading to speculation that a peak had been reached. But in the past few days, they have started to rise again, in line with a weekly pattern of fluctuations that shows the numbers usually dipping on a Monday. Find out more here.

statistics indicate that230 million domestic trips were made during,externalthe public holiday in China between 1 and 5 May - with media praising the figures as an indication that the public are
confident in the country's full recovery from Covid-19. Since 22 April, there have
been no new domestic cases, and for a good month, there have been none outside
the city of Ruili,Chinaâs
only recent, domestic outbreak. Papers have been highlighting howChinaâs
rail network has seen record passenger numbers,externalthat even surpass
pre-pandemic levels, andthat the tourism
industry has also seen ârobust recoveryâ,external. Nevertheless, there is still an element of post-holiday caution. One of
Chinaâs top epidemiologists, Wu Zunyou, has remindedpeople that they should now
self-isolate,externalas a precaution for 14 days if they have travelled, advice
that was given ahead of the holidays. A Sina Entertainment poll has also found thata large majority of 19,000 voting
netizens indicated they didnât travel anywhere,external, even for a day trip. There is concern at the moment that the rising number of cases in India
could spill over into the country. The Ruili outbreak last month was believed
to have entered via Myanmar, which borders China. And the Global Times has noted thatmany countries bordering both
India and China, like Nepal, have seen a recent spike in cases,external. Obese men are at a greater risk of severe Covid-19 and death than obese women, research has suggested. The data found that obese men with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or more had a ""significant association with higher in-hospital mortality"" - while for women, those with that link had a BMI of 40 or more. Researchers also found that obesity may be a stronger risk factor for severe Covid pneumonia and the need for a ventilator in men than in women. The study looked at data from 3,530 patients in hospital with Covid-19. It was carried out by a team at Montefiore Medical Centre in the Bronx, New York, with patients admitted from 10 March to 1 May last year. The authors of the study, published in the European Journal of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, suggested obesity could lead to poor Covid outcomes due to factors including poorer lung function and increased work of breathing. In Belgium, where some lockdown measures have recently been eased, outdoor dining at bars and restaurants is due to resume from 8 May. And while the country's nationwide curfew will officially be lifted on Saturday, it will still apply for two hours between 22:00 (20:00 GMT) and
midnight in the Brussels region on Friday. In the regions of Flanders and Wallonia, where the curfew currently comes into force at midnight, the rule will no longer apply from this weekend. But in the capital, Brussels, where the curfew is stricter and comes into effect earlier, it will still apply on Friday evening, before expiring at midnight when Saturday officially starts. In practice, this means that Brussels residents will have to be indoors by 22:00 on Friday, but will be able to go out again after midnight. âThis is a Belgian joke, and not even a good one,âBrussels MP Gilles Verstraeten said on Flemish radio on Thursday,external. âMy tolerance limit for such absurdities has reached its lowest point by now.â From Saturday, the curfew will be replaced by a ban on gatherings of more than three people (with an exception for larger households) from midnight to 05:00 across the country. Schools have reopened and a ban on non-essential travel was lifted in April. Hairdressers and other businesses are also open. With a population of 11.5 million, Belgium has recorded more than one million coronavirus cases and more than 24,000 deaths. More than 16m UK adults have now had a second Covid vaccination. The latest government figures show 404,226 people received a second jab on Wednesday, taking the total number to 16,291,719. Another 139,097 adults had their first vaccination - bringing that measurement to 34,934,171. In total 66.3% of adults have had their first jab, and 30.9% both doses. Pope Francis has urged medics in India to stay strong as he sent his support to the country, which is battling a Covid crisis. He sent a message to the Catholic Bishops' Conference in India, offering his ""heartfelt solidarity and spiritual closeness to all the Indian people"". ""My thoughts go above all to the sick and their families, to those who care for them, and in particular to those who are mourning the loss of their loved ones,"" he said. ""I think too of the many doctors, nurses, hospital workers, ambulance drivers and those working tirelessly to respond to the immediate needs of their brothers and sisters."" India reported almost 4,000 more Covid-related deaths on Thursday and more than 412,000 infections, Reuters news agency said. Almost three-quarters of people in England aged 45 to 49 are likely to have had their first dose of Covid vaccine, NHS England said. An estimated 74.7% of people in this age group had been given their first dose as of 2 May. Vaccine appointments in Englandare now opento everyone aged 40 and over. The NHS figures also suggest 89.5% of people aged 50 to 54 have had their first dose. That rises to 95.3% among 55 to 59-year-olds, 98% of 60 to 64-year-olds and 94.4% of 65 to 69-year-olds. The highest proportion is among people aged 70 and above, with 97.7% having had a first dose. Read more:When will I get the vaccine? The UK has reported a further 2,613 Covid cases. There were also 13 deaths within 28 days of a positive test, the latest government figures show. This compares to 2,144 cases and 27 deaths on Wednesday. Overall, the statistics show cases and deaths have continued a downward week-on-week trend. Faisal Islam and Ramzan KarmaliBBC News The governor of the Bank of England says that the central bank's growth forecast of 7.25% this year doesn't represent a boom - but more a bounce back. Andrew Bailey insists this is still good news, and says that the country is going to see a strong recovery this year. However, he warned that by the end of this year, output in the economy ""will be back to where it was the end of 2019"" and we should always remember we've had an economy with no growth for two years. The Bank now expects the unemployment rate to peak at 5.5% later this year - far below the 7.75% it predicted in February. Mr Bailey welcomed the revised forecast, and explained that fewer people will pass through unemployment before they can get jobs again, due to ongoing support. He also says he expects confidence to grow as more people are vaccinated. Maddy SavageBBC News, Stockholm Mass vaccination of Sweden's general population is expected to start later this month More than one in 10 Swedes have now
tested positive for Covid-19 since the start of the pandemic; in other words,
one million out of the countryâs small population of ten million. However, many epidemiologists believe the true figure is likely to be much higher, since testing rates were
low during the first wave, and Sweden doesnât have a national test-and-trace
app. The country has been struggling
to contain its third wave of coronavirus infections, and currently has one of
the highest rates of infection in the EU, with 675 cases per 100,000 residents. However, Swedenâs Public Health Agency says it is starting to detect a downward
trend in cases. The agencyâs head, Johan Carlsson, told a news conference earlier
that he expects case numbers to return to low levels in July and August, as
long as vaccination rates continue and Swedes follow ongoing social distancing
recommendations. So far, only those over 60 or in
risk groups have been vaccinated, with mass vaccination of the general
population expected to start later this month. Seven confirmed cases of the India variant of coronavirus have been found in Northern Ireland, the Department of Health has said. They are the first confirmed cases of the variant in the region. ""This news is not entirely unexpected and plans are in place for such an eventuality,"" chief medical officer Dr Michael McBride said. ""While preventative measures - including travel restrictions - are very important, the assessment is that these will delay rather than permanently prevent the spread of variants already detected elsewhere on these islands."" He says confirmation of these cases does not mean this variant is going to become the most prevalent or the dominant strain in Northern Ireland. ""It does, however, highlight why caution is still essential in relation to Covid-19,"" he added. The UK and the European Union have stopped short of backing calls from the United States for international rules that protect the patents on coronavirus vaccines to be waived. They've pledged instead to work with the World Trade Organization to improve the availability of vaccines. It comes after the US threw its support behind the move to temporarily lift the patent protection. India and South Africa proposed the plan, which they said would increase vaccine production around the world. But drugs manufacturers argue it may not have the desired effect. A UK government spokesperson said the UK was ""working with WTO members to resolve this issue"" and was ""in discussions with the US and WTO members to facilitate increased production and supply of Covid-19 vaccines"". They added: ""As one of the biggest donors to Covax [World Health Organization vaccine initiative], we will ensure global access to vaccines and continue to encourage manufacturers to provide their vaccines on a not-for-profit, transparent basis.â Meanwhile, pharmaceutical companies have voiced their opposition to a waiver, insisting that patents are not the primary obstacle, and cautioned that the move could stifle innovation.

""We are urging everyone to Protect Moray and get tested, even if they have no symptoms,"" he said.

Another 139,097 adults had their first vaccination - bringing that measurement to 34,934,171. In total 66.3% of adults have had their first jab, and 30.9% both doses. Pope Francis has urged medics in India to stay strong as he sent his support to the country, which is battling a Covid crisis. He sent a message to the Catholic Bishops' Conference in India, offering his ""heartfelt solidarity and spiritual closeness to all the Indian people"". ""My thoughts go above all to the sick and their families, to those who care for them, and in particular to those who are mourning the loss of their loved ones,"" he said. ""I think too of the many doctors, nurses, hospital workers, ambulance drivers and those working tirelessly to respond to the immediate needs of their brothers and sisters."" India reported almost 4,000 more Covid-related deaths on Thursday and more than 412,000 infections, Reuters news agency said. Almost three-quarters of people in England aged 45 to 49 are likely to have had their first dose of Covid vaccine, NHS England said. An estimated 74.7% of people in this age group had been given their first dose as of 2 May. Vaccine appointments in Englandare now opento everyone aged 40 and over. The NHS figures also suggest 89.5% of people aged 50 to 54 have had their first dose. That rises to 95.3% among 55 to 59-year-olds, 98% of 60 to 64-year-olds and 94.4% of 65 to 69-year-olds. The highest proportion is among people aged 70 and above, with 97.7% having had a first dose. Read more:When will I get the vaccine? The UK has reported a further 2,613 Covid cases. There were also 13 deaths within 28 days of a positive test, the latest government figures show. This compares to 2,144 cases and 27 deaths on Wednesday. Overall, the statistics show cases and deaths have continued a downward week-on-week trend. Faisal Islam and Ramzan KarmaliBBC News The governor of the Bank of England says that the central bank's growth forecast of 7.25% this year doesn't represent a boom - but more a bounce back. Andrew Bailey insists this is still good news, and says that the country is going to see a strong recovery this year. However, he warned that by the end of this year, output in the economy ""will be back to where it was the end of 2019"" and we should always remember we've had an economy with no growth for two years. The Bank now expects the unemployment rate to peak at 5.5% later this year - far below the 7.75% it predicted in February. Mr Bailey welcomed the revised forecast, and explained that fewer people will pass through unemployment before they can get jobs again, due to ongoing support. He also says he expects confidence to grow as more people are vaccinated. Maddy SavageBBC News, Stockholm Mass vaccination of Sweden's general population is expected to start later this month More than one in 10 Swedes have now
tested positive for Covid-19 since the start of the pandemic; in other words,
one million out of the countryâs small population of ten million. However, many epidemiologists believe the true figure is likely to be much higher, since testing rates were
low during the first wave, and Sweden doesnât have a national test-and-trace
app. The country has been struggling
to contain its third wave of coronavirus infections, and currently has one of
the highest rates of infection in the EU, with 675 cases per 100,000 residents. However, Swedenâs Public Health Agency says it is starting to detect a downward
trend in cases. The agencyâs head, Johan Carlsson, told a news conference earlier
that he expects case numbers to return to low levels in July and August, as
long as vaccination rates continue and Swedes follow ongoing social distancing
recommendations. So far, only those over 60 or in
risk groups have been vaccinated, with mass vaccination of the general
population expected to start later this month. Seven confirmed cases of the India variant of coronavirus have been found in Northern Ireland, the Department of Health has said. They are the first confirmed cases of the variant in the region. ""This news is not entirely unexpected and plans are in place for such an eventuality,"" chief medical officer Dr Michael McBride said. ""While preventative measures - including travel restrictions - are very important, the assessment is that these will delay rather than permanently prevent the spread of variants already detected elsewhere on these islands."" He says confirmation of these cases does not mean this variant is going to become the most prevalent or the dominant strain in Northern Ireland. ""It does, however, highlight why caution is still essential in relation to Covid-19,"" he added. The UK and the European Union have stopped short of backing calls from the United States for international rules that protect the patents on coronavirus vaccines to be waived. They've pledged instead to work with the World Trade Organization to improve the availability of vaccines. It comes after the US threw its support behind the move to temporarily lift the patent protection. India and South Africa proposed the plan, which they said would increase vaccine production around the world. But drugs manufacturers argue it may not have the desired effect. A UK government spokesperson said the UK was ""working with WTO members to resolve this issue"" and was ""in discussions with the US and WTO members to facilitate increased production and supply of Covid-19 vaccines"". They added: ""As one of the biggest donors to Covax [World Health Organization vaccine initiative], we will ensure global access to vaccines and continue to encourage manufacturers to provide their vaccines on a not-for-profit, transparent basis.â Meanwhile, pharmaceutical companies have voiced their opposition to a waiver, insisting that patents are not the primary obstacle, and cautioned that the move could stifle innovation.

Who really owns UK fishing rights?,"Fishing was one of the key sticking points in negotiations between the UK and the EU over their new trade agreement. The deal, which came into force on 1 January 2021,still allows EU boats to fish in UK waters for some years to comebut gives UK boats a greater share of the catch (or quota). The question of who has the right to fish in UK waters is further complicated by the fact that significant parts of the British quota have been sold off to foreign-owned boats, which sail under a British flag. Â£160m worth of England's fishing quota is in the hands of vessels owned by companies based in Iceland, Spain and the Netherlands, according to BBC research. That amounts to 130,000 tonnes of fish a year and 55% of the quota's annual value in 2019. Quotas are used by many countries to manage shared fish stocks. They determine how many fish of each species each country's fleets are allowed to catch. The EU's Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) sets quotas among EU member states, and similar deals are negotiated with neighbouring countries. The Dutch owners of the Frank Bonefaas super-trawler own a fifth of England's fishing quota One of the priorities of the Fisheries Act,external, which became law on 24 November, is that ""fishing activities of UK fishing boats bring social or economic benefits to the United Kingdom"". Current rules say even if vessels are 100% foreign-owned, they must have an ""economic link"" to the UK. That means they must meet one of five conditions, which include landing more than half their catch at UK ports or having majority British crews. A consultation by the Department for Environment and Rural Affairs (Defra),external, which closed in November, outlined plans to ""increase the landing requirements from 50% to 70% for quota catch caught by English registered vessels landing more than 2 tonnes per annum"". The consultation stated that this change ""could result in up to Â£60m worth of additional landings each year"", but it did not mention any changes to rules around ownership. For many in the fishing industry Defra's proposals did not go far enough. ""If the government allows foreign companies to continue to own more than half of England's quota, it would be a calamity,"" said Paul Lines, from Fishing for Leave, a pro-Brexit group within the British fishing industry. Fishing for Leave wants to change the rules so all British fishing vessels must be ""60% British-owned; 60% British-crewed; (and must) land, process and sell 60% of their catches in Britain"". ""I would be absolutely over the moon if they bring an end to foreign ownership,"" added Mr Lines, ""but it would surprise me if the government followed through on this as it wasn't mentioned in the bill or in the consultation."" An EU source said British negotiators were at one point insisting that boats must be majority British-owned in order to take advantage of a larger catch in UK waters, but this proposal does not feature in the final text of the deal. ""It could be possible, though administratively difficult, for the government to re-allocate any newly-won quota to British-owned boats,"" says Dr Emma Cardwell from Nottingham Trent University. ""But it would be legally tricky to try and wrest existing UK quota from the ownership of foreign companies."" Many parts of the quota were sold by English fishermen in the 1990s when fishing rights were cut dramatically. Cod fishing, for instance, was almost entirely stopped for several years. Foreign companies then bought it up as a long-term investment, and experts say the quota market has been allowed to develop in an unregulated way ever since. ""There's a lack of clarity on the legal status of fishing rights,"" Dr Cardwell said, ""meaning the government is very vulnerable to litigation if it tries to reallocate quota. ""Any foreign fishing companies that purchased UK quota in good faith would be very likely to sue if this was now taken away from them."" As fishing is a devolved policy, the way the quota is managed differs around the UK. England and Wales, where a majority voted for Brexit, have both allowed foreign ownership of more than half their fishing quota. In Wales, which is allocated a tiny share of the UK quota, the figure is as high as 85% of the annual value - most of it held by one big industrial trawler. But in Scotland, which is responsible for about 60% of the UK quota, only 4% of the annual value in 2019 was in foreign hands. In Northern Ireland the figure was 2%. ""The Scottish fishing industry is largely made up of family-owned businesses,"" said Elspeth MacDonald, from the Scottish Fishermen's Federation. ""These businesses have developed the industry during the good times and have had the desire and resolve to hold on through difficult times, when others have not."" The figures obtained by the BBC, in collaboration with the New Economics Foundation (NEF), reveal that a fifth of the annual value of the UK's overall quota is held by foreign-owned companies. The total annual value is just over Â£900m. Elsewhere in Europe the level of foreign ownership varies. In Belgium, the figure is just over a quarter, but other EU countries have much stricter rules. There is very little foreign ownership in France and Ireland for example, and in two countries outside the EU that have big fishing fleets - Iceland and Norway - there is no foreign ownership at all. The degree of confusion over foreign ownership of UK quota was highlighted by a ministerial response to a parliamentary question back in October. Victoria Prentis, the Fisheries Minister, admitted the Marine Management Organisation, the body responsible for English waters, ""does not hold data relating to the degree of foreign investment"".

Here are some of the main headlines we've been covering, from the UK and across the world:  A 62-year-old woman who has been waiting more than a year for heart surgery says shefears her condition has deteriorated. Linda Murray, from Lisburn, was due to have a procedure last January but it was cancelled due to the pandemic. She has been suffering with a mitral valve prolapse for eight years. Ms Murray said: ""I have been called for the pre-operative assessment a few times and then I have been mentally preparing myself for the surgery only for it not to happen, which is tough to deal with. ""The condition means I am incredibly tired. Some days all I can do is work and sleep because it takes so much out of me. ""It is now at the stage where we won't know if I will need a full valve replacement or repair until the surgeon begins operating. ""My cardiologist and the hospital staff have been incredible but it's the system that's the problem."" Northern Ireland's Health Minister Robin Swann said waiting lists had been ""unacceptable"" for some time. There were 90 people waiting more than six months for cardiac surgery at the end of 2020 compared to three people for the same period in 2019, according to figures from the British Heart Foundation.  Four St Johnstone players will miss Sunday's Scottish Cup semi-final with St Mirren after two members of the team tested positive for Covid-19 and two were advised to isolate. The two told to isolate later tested negative and the latest round of tests were all negative. ""It's very unfortunate for four of our players to miss out on the important game on Sunday,"" St Johnstone said. ""However, we wish all of them well and their health and wellbeing will always be our priority. We will keep our supporters updated if we need to share further information."" Read more. The number of UK Covid deaths is continuing to fall, according to the latest weekly data. The average number of daily deaths now stands at 12. While the average number of daily cases is also showing a downward trend - the numbers have started to level off. Meanwhile, the number of patients being treated for Covid in hospital is now at the lowest level since mid-September. The NHS isrevising the booking system for Covid-19 jabsin England after complaints that it could reveal individuals' vaccination status. By entering details such as their name, date of birth and postcode it may be possible to work out if another person has been given both doses, one or none. Privacy campaigners Big Brother Watch called it a ""shocking failure"". But NHS Digital said the system had no direct access to medical records and allowed millions to quickly book jabs. The website allows people to book appointments without using their NHS number, by entering their name, date of birth and postcode. But it gives different results depending on whether the individual has already had two doses, one or none, allowing a user to determine other people's vaccination status. The flaw in the website was first revealed by the Guardian,external, which said it could allow employers to monitor their workers' vaccination status - or put people at risk of peer pressure from anti-vaccination friends and colleagues not to get the jab. NHS Digital said it was revising the messages used by the booking system to improve privacy, but suggested that conclusions about someone's vaccine status from entering other people's data would not always be accurate. Shruti MenonBBC Reality Check, Delhi There are signs Covid infections have slowed in some regions of India - but is the country past the worst? India's surge in infections began around mid-March and soon increased rapidly. It reached a peak of more than 400,000 recorded daily cases on 30 April. Over subsequent days the numbers fell, with just under 360,000 on Monday 3 May - leading to speculation that a peak had been reached. But in the past few days, they have started to rise again, in line with a weekly pattern of fluctuations that shows the numbers usually dipping on a Monday. Find out more here. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Official
statistics indicate that230 million domestic trips were made during,externalthe public holiday in China between 1 and 5 May - with media praising the figures as an indication that the public are
confident in the country's full recovery from Covid-19. Since 22 April, there have
been no new domestic cases, and for a good month, there have been none outside
the city of Ruili,Chinaâs
only recent, domestic outbreak. Papers have been highlighting howChinaâs
rail network has seen record passenger numbers,externalthat even surpass
pre-pandemic levels, andthat the tourism
industry has also seen ârobust recoveryâ,external. Nevertheless, there is still an element of post-holiday caution. One of
Chinaâs top epidemiologists, Wu Zunyou, has remindedpeople that they should now
self-isolate,externalas a precaution for 14 days if they have travelled, advice
that was given ahead of the holidays. A Sina Entertainment poll has also found thata large majority of 19,000 voting
netizens indicated they didnât travel anywhere,external, even for a day trip. There is concern at the moment that the rising number of cases in India
could spill over into the country. The Ruili outbreak last month was believed
to have entered via Myanmar, which borders China. And the Global Times has noted thatmany countries bordering both
India and China, like Nepal, have seen a recent spike in cases,external. Obese men are at a greater risk of severe Covid-19 and death than obese women, research has suggested. The data found that obese men with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or more had a ""significant association with higher in-hospital mortality"" - while for women, those with that link had a BMI of 40 or more. Researchers also found that obesity may be a stronger risk factor for severe Covid pneumonia and the need for a ventilator in men than in women. The study looked at data from 3,530 patients in hospital with Covid-19. It was carried out by a team at Montefiore Medical Centre in the Bronx, New York, with patients admitted from 10 March to 1 May last year. The authors of the study, published in the European Journal of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, suggested obesity could lead to poor Covid outcomes due to factors including poorer lung function and increased work of breathing. In Belgium, where some lockdown measures have recently been eased, outdoor dining at bars and restaurants is due to resume from 8 May. And while the country's nationwide curfew will officially be lifted on Saturday, it will still apply for two hours between 22:00 (20:00 GMT) and
midnight in the Brussels region on Friday. In the regions of Flanders and Wallonia, where the curfew currently comes into force at midnight, the rule will no longer apply from this weekend. But in the capital, Brussels, where the curfew is stricter and comes into effect earlier, it will still apply on Friday evening, before expiring at midnight when Saturday officially starts. In practice, this means that Brussels residents will have to be indoors by 22:00 on Friday, but will be able to go out again after midnight. âThis is a Belgian joke, and not even a good one,âBrussels MP Gilles Verstraeten said on Flemish radio on Thursday,external. âMy tolerance limit for such absurdities has reached its lowest point by now.â From Saturday, the curfew will be replaced by a ban on gatherings of more than three people (with an exception for larger households) from midnight to 05:00 across the country. Schools have reopened and a ban on non-essential travel was lifted in April. Hairdressers and other businesses are also open. With a population of 11.5 million, Belgium has recorded more than one million coronavirus cases and more than 24,000 deaths. More than 16m UK adults have now had a second Covid vaccination. The latest government figures show 404,226 people received a second jab on Wednesday, taking the total number to 16,291,719.

UK says French threat 'unacceptable',"The Government of Jersey granted 41 licences to French fishing boats on Friday A French government threat to cut off Jersey's electricity over a post-Brexit fishing dispute was ""clearly unacceptable and disproportionate"", the UK government has said. French Maritime Minister Annick Girardinthreatened ""retaliatory measures""over the new licensing regime for fishing in Jersey's waters. About 95% of the island's electricity comes from France via undersea cables. A UK government spokesman said they were working with the EU and Jersey. ""To threaten Jersey like this is clearly unacceptable and disproportionate,"" the spokesman said. ""We are working closely with the EU and Jersey on fisheries access provisions following the end of the transition period so trust the French will use the mechanisms of our new treaty to solve problems."" The row emerged over a new licensing system for French fishing vessels. The system was introduced by the Government of Jersey under the UK-EU Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA). Jerseyissued 41 licences for access to its waters on Fridaywhen an interim agreement came to an end. The Jersey government said the permits must ""correspond to the previous activity a vessel has carried out in Jersey waters"" under the terms of the TCA and its new system was ""in line with the data submitted by the French and EU authorities"". A spokeswoman said it took French complaints over the terms of the licensing agreement ""very seriously"" and would respond, but said it had acted in ""good faith"" setting up the regime. ""The government remains committed to the sustainable management of Jersey waters for the benefit of this and future generations,"" she said. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Ian Gorst, External Relations Minister for the Government of Jersey, argued there was no justification for such severe measures. ""This is not the first threat that the French have made to either Jersey or the United Kingdom since we are into this new deal,"" he said. ""It would seem disproportionate to cut off electricity for the sake of needing to provide extra details so that we can refine the licences."" On Tuesday, he explained there was ""no time limit"" for the French fishing industry or government to provide evidence of previous activity in Jersey waters and he wanted to ""heal this relationship"". ""If French fishermen or the authorities have further evidence they would like to submit, we will update the licences to reflect that evidence."" French authorities said ""new technical measures"" for fishing off the Channel Islands had not been communicated to the EU, rendering them ""null and void"". Representatives from Normandy have closed their office in St Helier in protest of ""inexplicable conditions"" in the new scheme, which had been introduced ""against all expectations"". These include caps on the number of fishing days for different vessels, restrictions on gear and the closure of fishing areas.

France threatens Jersey power cut,"Tensions with the UK have made Channel waters choppier for French trawlers The French government has warned it could cut electricity to Jersey amid an escalating row over post-Brexit fishing rights. Maritime Minister Annick Girardin told the French parliament that new rules governing access to Channel Islands waters were unacceptable. She said France was ""ready to use... retaliatory measures"" under the UK-EU post-Brexit trade deal. ""I am sorry it has come to this [but] we will do so if we have to,"" she said. Jersey, the largest of the Channel Islands, receives 95% of its electricity through three underwater cables from France. What does the deal mean for fishing? European Parliament backs Brexit trade deal Who really owns UK fishing rights? In a statement to AFP news agency, the French fisheries ministry said the UK had introduced ""new technical measures"" linked to licences for fishing off the Channel Islands which had not been communicated to the EU and were therefore ""null and void"". Meanwhile, the UK's Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""We are clear that Jersey is responsible for its own territorial waters."" The latest comments mark an escalation in the row over fishing rights, which has been simmering for months and marked a key sticking point in post-Brexit trade talks. French fishermen have complained of being prevented from operating in British waters because of difficulties in obtaining licences. To receive a licence under an agreement with the EU, French boat operators have to show a history of fishing in the area. Jersey has the sole power to issue the licences, and as of last week all fishing boats are required to have a licence to operate there. On Friday, the Jersey government granted 41 permits to French fishing vessels that are equipped with technology that allows them to be located. But the French government claimed the list of approved ships came with further demands that ""were not arranged or discussed, and which we were not notified about"". The French fisheries ministry said the new rules dictated ""where the ships can go and cannot go"" as well as the number of days fishermen can spend in the area. ""This is absolutely unacceptable,"" Ms Girardin said. ""If we accept this for Jersey, it would imperil our access everywhere."" Last week, French Europe Minister ClÃ©ment Beaune accused the UK more broadly of blocking fishing rights. He said the EU could respond with ""reprisals"" in financial services. Meanwhile, British seafood exporters have been hit by an EU ban on UK exports of live shellfish such as mussels, oysters, clams, cockles and scallops. The UK has also failed to strike a new fishing agreement with Norway. That failure threatens to prevent British trawlers catching cod in Norway's sub-Arctic seas.

US vows to respond to reckless Russian acts,"The US official made the comments at a meeting with the Ukrainian president in Kyiv on Thursday The US secretary of state has told Russia to cease all ""reckless and aggressive actions"" towards Ukraine. Antony Blinken made the comments during a trip to Kyiv on Thursday where he met top Ukrainian officials. Speaking alongside President Volodymyr Zelensky, he said the US was looking to strengthen security co-operation and assistance between the two countries. The visit comes just weeks after Russia deployed thousands of soldiers close to the Ukrainian border. ""We are aware that Russia has withdrawn some forces from the border... but we also see that significant forces remain there [and] significant equipment remains there,"" Mr Blinken said. The top US diplomat said Washington was ""monitoring the situation very, very closely"". Who is America's new top diplomat? What Biden's foreign policy 'reset' really means America is back, says Blinken He did not provide further details of any additional security support the US was considering. Barbara Plett Usher, the BBC's State Department correspondent, says the visit was intended to signal that Ukraine is a high foreign policy priority for President Joe Biden's administration. Mr Blinken travelled to Ukraine following a meeting of foreign ministers of the G7 group of industrialised nations in London earlier this week. A statement issued after the two-day talks criticised Moscow for its ""irresponsible and destabilising behaviour"", particularly against Ukraine, and for cyber-attacks. Mr Blinken echoed those sentiments on Thursday while appearing alongside President Zelensky, who said his country was under threat from Russian troops massed near its border. The US and Russia have been long-term adversaries and remain far apart on major issues. In February, US President Joe Biden said he had made it clear to Russian President Vladimir Putin ""that the days of the United States rolling over in the face of Russia's aggressive actions [were] over"". But Mr Biden's predecessor, Republican Donald Trump, said during his presidential campaign that he would get along with Mr Putin. He sought to improve ties while in office, a stance at odds with traditional Republican party policy. By Jonah Fisher, BBC Ukraine correspondent After the intrigue, phone calls and blackmail that dominated the Trump administration's dealings with Ukraine - the presidency of Mr Biden was what many Ukrainians wanted. They are hoping for a steady and dependable ally. Mr Trump was impeached in 2019 over allegations he improperly sought help from Ukraine to boost his chances of re-election. He was acquitted, but the saga certainly strained US-Ukraine relations. Mr Blinken has promised to reinvigorate the relationship. He has been keen to stress that the US stood with Ukraine against Russian aggression, and has said that he is looking at ways of strengthening security co-operation. To enhance its security, Ukraine would like to become a member of Nato - a military alliance of countries from Europe and North America. But there was little encouragement on that front, and Mr Blinken simply said that those aspirations had been discussed. Mr Blinken told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme that the US would prefer a ""more stable and predictable relationship"" with Russia, but would respond to reckless or aggressive acts. He said Washington was focused on actions such as the treatment of opposition figure Alexei Navalny, the Solar Winds hack and election interference. He touched on a number of other policy areas in his BBC interview, including Iran and the planned troop withdrawal from Afghanistan. This video can not be played America's top diplomat warns on doing business with China Mr Blinken insisted that the Biden administration was not trying to hold China back on the world stage, but he stressed that Washington was in favour of upholding a rules-based international system. On Afghanistan, Mr Blinken insisted that the US was ""staying in the game"" and would remain engaged with the country despite an earlier announcement that its soldiers would leave by September. Twenty years in Afghanistan - was it worth it? Mr Blinken said regional powers might have to ""step up"" and use their influence and try to keep the country on a positive path. Asked about a possible trade deal with the UK and the situation in Northern Ireland, Mr Blinken said the administration remained very focused on peace in Ireland. The secretary of state said that for President Biden it was important that ""whatever is done, whatever we do, the gains of the Good Friday Agreement are sustained and we have the political and economic well-being of Northern Ireland in mind"". Joe Biden has previously said that Brexit must not endanger the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, which effectively ended Northern Ireland's ""Troubles"". Post-Brexit trade arrangements for Northern Ireland have led to tensions there and contributed to the recent resignation of First Minister Arlene Foster. Why are there Brexit checks in Northern Ireland? What Biden's foreign policy 'reset' really means Who is America's new top diplomat?

India says 'double mutant' linked to Covid surge,"The government's top scientific adviser has warned that a third wave is inevitable India has said a new variant of the coronavirus first discovered there in March may be linked to a deadly second wave. Samples containing the ""double mutant""- or B.1.617 variant - have been found in several states with high case numbers. An official with the National Centre for Disease Control said, however, that they had still been unable to fully establish a correlation. A double mutant is when two mutations come together in the same virus. What is the India Covid variant? India is a Covid disaster - it didn't have to be Meanwhile, India reported a record 412,000 cases in the space of 24 hours on Wednesday, and 3,980 deaths. The government's top scientific adviser also warned a third wave is inevitable. Speaking at a health ministry news briefing, K VijayRaghavan admitted that experts had not anticipated the ""ferocity"" of the surge in cases. ""Phase three is inevitable, given the high levels of circulating virus,"" he added during a news briefing. ""But it is not clear on what timescale this phase three will occur... We should prepare for new waves."" The current surge of the virus has already overwhelmed the healthcare system with hospital beds, oxygen and even crematorium space in short supply. Several states are under localised lockdowns and curfews, but the government is reluctant to impose a national lockdown, for fear of the impact on the economy. Out of roughly 13,000 samples sequenced, more than 3,500 were found to be variants of concern - including B.1.617 - across eight states. The B.1.617 variant was reported in several states reporting surges including Maharashtra, Karnataka, West Bengal, Gujarat and Chhattisgarh. For more than a month, Delhi insisted that the variant had no link to the current surge. Virologist Dr Shahid Jameeltold the BBC's Vikas Pandey earlierthat India started seriously looking at mutations fairly late, with sequencing efforts only ""properly started"" in mid-February 2021. India is sequencing just over 1% of all samples at the moment. ""In comparison, the UK was sequencing at 5-6% at the peak of the pandemic. But you can't build such capacity overnight,"" he said. Indians' desperate wait for Covid jab to get longer US backs waiver on vaccine patents to boost supply And although the central government now says there is a correlation, it added the link is not ""fully established"". ""Its epidemiological and clinical correlation is not fully establishedâ¦ without the correlation, we cannot establish direct linkage to any surge. However, we have advised states to strengthen public health response - increase testing, quick isolation, prevent crowds, vaccination,"" Sujeet Singh, National Centre for Disease Control said. A number of states have reported their highest fatalities in a single day A number of states reported their highest fatalities in a single day on Wednesday - including the northern states of Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Punjab and Tamil Nadu and Karnataka in the south. The western state of Maharashtra, which has had the highest caseload throughout the pandemic, reported 920 deaths. However, experts say the tally could be far higher due to reduced testing, and under-reporting of deaths. In  a weekly report, the World Heath Organization said that India accounted for nearly half the coronavirus cases reported worldwide last week, and a quarter of deaths. Indian delegates in UK for G7 talks self-isolate Covid cases at Everest raise fears of outbreak An Indian delegation that travelled to the G7 Foreign Ministers' meeting in London this week, is self-isolating after two of its members tested positive for Covid-19. India's foreign minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar travelled with the delegation to London, and says he will attend the rest of the summit virtually. India has been unable to meet an ambitious vaccination programme - it initially wanted to vaccinate 300 million people by July - and there's been a dramatic drop in jabs because of a shortage of doses. Just 26 million people out of a population of 1.4 billion have received both shots, and about 129 million have only received a single dose. Vaccine stocks in the country have nearly dried up, with the latest age bracket to become eligible - adults under the age of 45 - struggling to register and secure appointments. Experts say lockdowns and vaccinations are the only way out, but that the government would need to act now in order to break the chain. What is the India Covid variant?

Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor The national polling puts Conservatives ahead most of the time, but there are matters that exist in local communities which can't be accounted for in national polling. The parties are flying blind this time around. They haven't been able to campaign on the doorstep due to the pandemic. Whether it's Hartlepool's MP or Wakefield's council, the Conservatives are hoping to show they can dig further into territory which would have been alien to them a decade ago. Labour is under pressure to show that under Sir Keir Starmer, they're able to stop the rot. Whether Nicola Sturgeon can achieve an overall majority in Holyrood, then the UK could be headed for another couple of years of very intense constitutional debate. It could very quickly become Boris Johnson's biggest headache. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Two voters in Glasgow North West have said they were temporarily turned away from a polling station because ballot boxes were ""too full"". Nadeem and Joanna Basharat were turned away from Jordanhill Parish Church polling station at 8:30pm, and told to come back later. A steward said ballot box 52 was too full and they were told to come back by 10pm. When they went back to vote, they said the box was still very full. It looked like the papers inside had just been ""pushed down"". A spokesman for Glasgow's Returning Officer said: ""The sheer size of the regional paper meant some ballot boxes became full. We were able to deliver replacement boxes, but in this case some voters were asked to wait outside before voting. ""The presiding officer is confident that all voters who were asked to wait were ultimately able to vote."" Labour and the Conservatives have both sought to play down expectations as the votes begin to be counted. Labour acknowledged the elections would be ""tough"", with a Labour source saying: ""Keir has always been honest about the mountain we must climb to rebuild trust to win the next general election. ""Labour is listening and we will continue to change in order to win back the trust of working people in Britain and their communities."" It's a similar story from the Conservatives. A Tory source said it was ""looking tough in Hartlepool"" as ""Labour have flooded the area with activists"". Conservative staff had been encouraged to use spare time on Thursday evening to make calls for the candidate Jill Mortimer. It was also suggested it was a ""mixed picture"" across the country. Young people aged 16 and 17-years-old could vote in today's Scottish and Welsh elections - but not in England. We spoke to some teenagers in Leeds to see what they thought - and what policies they cared about. This video can not be played Alex ForsythPolitical correspondent The amount of journalists descending on the town of Hartlepool in the past few weeks shows the level of interest in how this town will vote in their by-election. It's a crucial test for Boris Johnson's Conservatives, whether the support they won at the general election in 2019 was a one-off, or if it's something they can sustain. If Labour lose here, a seat they've held for decades, then it will cause questions for Sir Keir Starmer, as well as deeper questions for the party itself. The ballot boxes are coming in now, and we should know the result in the morning. We will soon know if traditional party allegiances are starting to fray. Ballot papers are arriving at the Mill House Leisure Centre in Hartlepool for the counting overnight. We're hoping to be able to report a result at about 04:00 BST. Heavy snowfall reopened the Lake District Ski Club today For pretty obvious reasons, weather can affect turnout on polling day. In 2019,researchers from the University of Reading,externalanalysed turnout for the constituency of Wokingham since 1945. They found:  Scotland has reported wet, cold, windy weather today. Across the highlands of Scotland, there's been heavy snowfall. BBC Weather has reported that in the whole of April, 3mm of rain fell in Leuchars in Scotland, but in the past six days there has been more than 10 times that. And it's been a pretty wet day across much of England, and particularly cold for this time of year. Hywel GriffithBBC News' Wales Correspondent The question in any Welsh election is not if Labour will hold on to power in the Welsh Government, it's more how many seats they will secure. Out of 22 years in power, they've never had an overall majority of the 60 seats in the Senedd. They won 29 seats last time, and the overall assumption this time is that their seats will be decreased a bit, potentially to the low 20s. The Conservatives are feeling pretty confident that they might have secured second place in polling, particularly through Labour-held seats in north east Wales. It's been harder for Plaid Cymru to break through during the pandemic, they've been largely in agreement with Labour's policies over the past year. Their leader, Adam Price, may yet find himself in power if Labour need help to govern during the next Senedd session. Counting won't start until tomorrow. Results should be known by tomorrow night. The polls in the Scottish election have closed and counting will begin from 09:00 GMT on Friday. You can find resultsas they come in here.

been a big set of elections that will take a while to digest. Not least of all
because the counts are going to go on for days. Overnight, the immediate focus
will likely be what's happened in the Hartlepool by-election; it's one of the
few counts taking place in the wee hours. Has Labour held on or will Boris
Johnson have taken another bite out of that so-called ""red wall""? While by-elections aren't exact litmus tests of public opinion, leaders will
inevitably be judged by their party's performance in such a contest. However
given the sheer number of polls in play there will be plenty else to chew over
- locally and nationally - across England, Wales and Scotland. And, of course, the future of the United Kingdom itself has again been up for discussion with
the SNP hoping this election can bolster its case for a further independence
referendum. Unlike a general election tonight there will no big, instantaneous
exit poll. This bumper set of elections is going to require a bit of patience
as we wait for results to roll in. It's 22:00 BST - and that means the polls are closed. The last of the votes have been cast and the counting (in some places) can now begin. Some contests will declare overnight - including the Hartlepool by-election, while the outcome of Welsh elections should be known by the end ofFriday. The West Midlands mayoral results are expected onSaturdayafternoon and the outcome of the Scottish Parliament results could arrive later that evening. Sunday, at the latest, will bring us London and West Yorkshire mayoral results - as well as more news from the English councils. The final results for police and crime commissioners should arrive byMonday. It's been a challenge for officials and volunteers to get polling stations ready for a safe vote amid the pandemic. Measures have included perspex screens and sanitary wipes for booths. The BBC put together a list ofdos, don'ts and coronavirus safety measures here.

He was acquitted, but the saga certainly strained US-Ukraine relations. Mr Blinken has promised to reinvigorate the relationship. He has been keen to stress that the US stood with Ukraine against Russian aggression, and has said that he is looking at ways of strengthening security co-operation. To enhance its security, Ukraine would like to become a member of Nato - a military alliance of countries from Europe and North America. But there was little encouragement on that front, and Mr Blinken simply said that those aspirations had been discussed. Mr Blinken told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme that the US would prefer a ""more stable and predictable relationship"" with Russia, but would respond to reckless or aggressive acts. He said Washington was focused on actions such as the treatment of opposition figure Alexei Navalny, the Solar Winds hack and election interference. He touched on a number of other policy areas in his BBC interview, including Iran and the planned troop withdrawal from Afghanistan. This video can not be played America's top diplomat warns on doing business with China Mr Blinken insisted that the Biden administration was not trying to hold China back on the world stage, but he stressed that Washington was in favour of upholding a rules-based international system. On Afghanistan, Mr Blinken insisted that the US was ""staying in the game"" and would remain engaged with the country despite an earlier announcement that its soldiers would leave by September. Twenty years in Afghanistan - was it worth it? Mr Blinken said regional powers might have to ""step up"" and use their influence and try to keep the country on a positive path. Asked about a possible trade deal with the UK and the situation in Northern Ireland, Mr Blinken said the administration remained very focused on peace in Ireland. The secretary of state said that for President Biden it was important that ""whatever is done, whatever we do, the gains of the Good Friday Agreement are sustained and we have the political and economic well-being of Northern Ireland in mind"". Joe Biden has previously said that Brexit must not endanger the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, which effectively ended Northern Ireland's ""Troubles"". Post-Brexit trade arrangements for Northern Ireland have led to tensions there and contributed to the recent resignation of First Minister Arlene Foster.

Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor The national polling puts Conservatives ahead most of the time, but there are matters that exist in local communities which can't be accounted for in national polling. The parties are flying blind this time around. They haven't been able to campaign on the doorstep due to the pandemic. Whether it's Hartlepool's MP or Wakefield's council, the Conservatives are hoping to show they can dig further into territory which would have been alien to them a decade ago. Labour is under pressure to show that under Sir Keir Starmer, they're able to stop the rot. Whether Nicola Sturgeon can achieve an overall majority in Holyrood, then the UK could be headed for another couple of years of very intense constitutional debate. It could very quickly become Boris Johnson's biggest headache. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Two voters in Glasgow North West have said they were temporarily turned away from a polling station because ballot boxes were ""too full"". Nadeem and Joanna Basharat were turned away from Jordanhill Parish Church polling station at 8:30pm, and told to come back later. A steward said ballot box 52 was too full and they were told to come back by 10pm. When they went back to vote, they said the box was still very full. It looked like the papers inside had just been ""pushed down"". A spokesman for Glasgow's Returning Officer said: ""The sheer size of the regional paper meant some ballot boxes became full. We were able to deliver replacement boxes, but in this case some voters were asked to wait outside before voting. ""The presiding officer is confident that all voters who were asked to wait were ultimately able to vote."" Labour and the Conservatives have both sought to play down expectations as the votes begin to be counted. Labour acknowledged the elections would be ""tough"", with a Labour source saying: ""Keir has always been honest about the mountain we must climb to rebuild trust to win the next general election. ""Labour is listening and we will continue to change in order to win back the trust of working people in Britain and their communities."" It's a similar story from the Conservatives. A Tory source said it was ""looking tough in Hartlepool"" as ""Labour have flooded the area with activists"". Conservative staff had been encouraged to use spare time on Thursday evening to make calls for the candidate Jill Mortimer. It was also suggested it was a ""mixed picture"" across the country. Young people aged 16 and 17-years-old could vote in today's Scottish and Welsh elections - but not in England. We spoke to some teenagers in Leeds to see what they thought - and what policies they cared about. This video can not be played Alex ForsythPolitical correspondent The amount of journalists descending on the town of Hartlepool in the past few weeks shows the level of interest in how this town will vote in their by-election. It's a crucial test for Boris Johnson's Conservatives, whether the support they won at the general election in 2019 was a one-off, or if it's something they can sustain. If Labour lose here, a seat they've held for decades, then it will cause questions for Sir Keir Starmer, as well as deeper questions for the party itself. The ballot boxes are coming in now, and we should know the result in the morning. We will soon know if traditional party allegiances are starting to fray. Ballot papers are arriving at the Mill House Leisure Centre in Hartlepool for the counting overnight. We're hoping to be able to report a result at about 04:00 BST. Heavy snowfall reopened the Lake District Ski Club today For pretty obvious reasons, weather can affect turnout on polling day. In 2019,researchers from the University of Reading,externalanalysed turnout for the constituency of Wokingham since 1945. They found:  Scotland has reported wet, cold, windy weather today. Across the highlands of Scotland, there's been heavy snowfall. BBC Weather has reported that in the whole of April, 3mm of rain fell in Leuchars in Scotland, but in the past six days there has been more than 10 times that. And it's been a pretty wet day across much of England, and particularly cold for this time of year. Hywel GriffithBBC News' Wales Correspondent The question in any Welsh election is not if Labour will hold on to power in the Welsh Government, it's more how many seats they will secure. Out of 22 years in power, they've never had an overall majority of the 60 seats in the Senedd. They won 29 seats last time, and the overall assumption this time is that their seats will be decreased a bit, potentially to the low 20s. The Conservatives are feeling pretty confident that they might have secured second place in polling, particularly through Labour-held seats in north east Wales. It's been harder for Plaid Cymru to break through during the pandemic, they've been largely in agreement with Labour's policies over the past year. Their leader, Adam Price, may yet find himself in power if Labour need help to govern during the next Senedd session. Counting won't start until tomorrow. Results should be known by tomorrow night. The polls in the Scottish election have closed and counting will begin from 09:00 GMT on Friday. You can find resultsas they come in here.

been a big set of elections that will take a while to digest. Not least of all
because the counts are going to go on for days. Overnight, the immediate focus
will likely be what's happened in the Hartlepool by-election; it's one of the
few counts taking place in the wee hours. Has Labour held on or will Boris
Johnson have taken another bite out of that so-called ""red wall""? While by-elections aren't exact litmus tests of public opinion, leaders will
inevitably be judged by their party's performance in such a contest. However
given the sheer number of polls in play there will be plenty else to chew over
- locally and nationally - across England, Wales and Scotland. And, of course, the future of the United Kingdom itself has again been up for discussion with
the SNP hoping this election can bolster its case for a further independence
referendum. Unlike a general election tonight there will no big, instantaneous
exit poll. This bumper set of elections is going to require a bit of patience
as we wait for results to roll in. It's 22:00 BST - and that means the polls are closed. The last of the votes have been cast and the counting (in some places) can now begin. Some contests will declare overnight - including the Hartlepool by-election, while the outcome of Welsh elections should be known by the end ofFriday. The West Midlands mayoral results are expected onSaturdayafternoon and the outcome of the Scottish Parliament results could arrive later that evening. Sunday, at the latest, will bring us London and West Yorkshire mayoral results - as well as more news from the English councils. The final results for police and crime commissioners should arrive byMonday. It's been a challenge for officials and volunteers to get polling stations ready for a safe vote amid the pandemic. Measures have included perspex screens and sanitary wipes for booths. The BBC put together a list ofdos, don'ts and coronavirus safety measures here.

SIGN UP FOR WALES ALERTS:Get extra updates on BBC election coverage Welsh Labour leader Mark Drakeford arrives to vote at St Catherine's Church Hall in Cardiff on Thursday After the polls officially closed Welsh Labour leader Mark Drakeford, who was first minister in the previous Welsh government, thanked 16 and 17 year olds who had ""exercised their new right to vote for the first time"". This video can not be played For the first time 16 and 17-year-olds were able to vote in Wales ""In the coming days, the political make-up of the next Senedd will become clear. We await those results,"" he said. Leader of the Welsh Conservatives, Andrew RT Davies, arrives to cast his vote at Llancarfan Village Hall Voters had cast their ballot to elect 40 Members of the Senedd (MSs) representing local constituencies, and 20 representing five large regions - North Wales, Mid and West Wales, South Wales West, South Wales Central and South Wales East. The regions elect four MSs each. How the BBC reports polling day Can I take a selfie at a polling station? Voters had got two ballots - one to back a candidate in their constituency, and one to support a party list of candidates or individual in their region. In the constituency ballots the candidate with the most votes wins, the same system used at UK general elections. Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price voted in the village of Pontargothi in Carmarthenshire But the ballot for the region is decided by a mathematical process in which people are elected more according to their share of the vote. The system takes into account who has won the constituency seats within that region and gives parties winning fewer or none of those constituencies a better chance of winning regional ones. The party or combination of parties that can command the greatest support in the Senedd after the election will form the next Welsh government. Welsh Liberal Democrats' leader Jane Dodds cast her ballot at Hay-on-Wye Bowling Club In police and crime commissioner elections you can vote for a first and second choice candidate. If no candidate gets more than 50% of the first choice votes, all except the top two candidates are eliminated. If your first choice candidate is eliminated, and your second choice is for one of the top two, your second choice is counted. Elections were also held on Thursday for the Scottish Parliament, and London's mayor and assembly. In England, PCC elections took place and voters went to the polls to elect local councils and directly elected mayors. There was also a by-election to choose a new MP at Westminster for Hartlepool.

"Many female athletes 'may walk away' after CovidElite sports women struggled with access to equipment and financial difficulties, an academic says.Wales","This video can not be played Gymnast Latalia Bevan and rugby international Angharad de Smet say the pandemic left their careers in the balance Increasing numbers of top female athletes will walk away from their sport due to difficulties during the pandemic, leading figures have warned. Gymnast Latalia Bevan, 20, and rugby international Angharad de Smet, 24, say Covid has left their careers in the balance. Sports sociologist Dr Ali Bowes said it had highlighted inequalities in sport. ""There are absolutely concerns women will walk away,"" she said. Wales rugby international de Smet, who has worked on the front line during the pandemic, said she's been left wondering whether ""the love of the game is enough?"" The 24-year-old from Ammanford, who was playing for Wales in the Autumn Internationals and as part of the sevens squad before Covid-19, was ""living the life of a professional athlete, without the pay cheque"". But as Wales began its first lockdown, games and training were cancelled. Angharad de Smet has been working on the Covid front line while also maintaining her fitness Over the last year, she said she's trained with just one kettlebell, unable to access proper equipment or facilities. Her last game of rugby was 14 months ago. The physiotherapist technician, who works on an elderly care ward in Swansea, said she has struggled to train after gruelling shifts in hospital. ""You've seen things you would hope to never see again in your lifetime, to come home and try and do a gym session... in your tiny kitchen... you think 'why am I bothering?'"" In 2019, the 24-year-old had been travelling to Worcester to train a couple of times a week after work, arriving home in the early hours. Athletics faces âhuge challengeâ to return Covid 'widened financial inequality in Wales' ""Nobody understands how much we give, just the wear and tear on your car, the petrol, putting food on the table, trying to get good food into you to aid recovery is expensive."" Now, she describes her future in the sport as ""uncertain"". ""Do I put my career first or do I pursue my dream of playing internationally, becoming a professional athlete? I am 24, should I have to make those sorts of calls already?"" Commonwealth Games silver medallist Latalia Bevan said the challenges of a global pandemic were a ""massive"" factor in her decision to retire from elite gymnastics earlier this year. Latalia Bevan has been working as a home carer since retiring ""It was so hard to keep your motivation, we'd do two or three Zooms a day, so my home turned into a gym and I'm from a family of seven."" The 20-year-old from Merthyr Tydfil, who won Wales' first gymnastics medal at the Gold Coast 2018 Games in Australia, had been training for 32 hours a week as well as studying at university in Cardiff. As a student, she used her loan to help cover costs after losing GB funding and while recovering from an operation. But after leaving her studies, she lost the financial support and struggled to adjust to a new life away from the gym after 14 years. She's been working as a home carer since retiring and said it's nice not to have to rely on her family to pay for things. Latalia won silver at the Gold Coast 2018 Commonwealth Games in Australia The former gymnast said she'd thought about returning to the sport but, if she did, she'd have to quit her job and that isn't an option with rent to pay. Covid: Athletes' safety concerns over lockdown exercise She's now focused on becoming a gymnastics coach and personal trainer. Alecs Donovan says the pandemic gave her the chance to sit back and prioritise seeing family and friends Rugby player Alecs Donovan ""would never have thought"" that at the end of the third lockdown she'd retire. With her yoga businesses closed, the 30-year-old said she was able to train ""more than ever"". The business owner said the pandemic has given her the chance to sit back and prioritise seeing family and friends. As a personal trainer who works with professional male athletes, she said it can be worse seeing their schedules and the support they get. She added she was aware of women who don't go for promotions because their current job allows them to play the sport, but she wonders what will happen when rugby stops. Dr Ali Bowes, senior lecturer in sociology of sport at Nottingham Trent University, said: ""It's one year on from lockdown and it's really obvious where the inequalities exist."" Her research, looking at the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on elite women's sport, found women struggled to access equipment, a gender ""play"" gap where men's sport returned faster and financial difficulties for women who were unable to play. ""There are absolutely concerns that women will walk away and we've seen that already with some examples in a number of sports where it's been too difficult for them to continue,"" she said. The sociologist is optimistic that discussions about the problems in women's sport, and the difficulties athletes face can be used for positive change. ""There's also been significant forward steps, and it's put equality really on the agenda for lots of sports organisations, teams, clubs and national governing bodies. There's no hiding place now.""

Theatres will then be allowed to fill 100% of capacity, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced. Thousands lost work when Broadway theatres closed in March 2020 due to the pandemic. ""Broadway is a major part of our state's identity and economy, and we are thrilled that the curtains will rise again,"" Mr Cuomo said on Twitter. New York plans to lift the majority of coronavirus restrictions later this month, but Broadway needs more time for rehearsals and producers need time to advertise the shows. Broadway workers fight to stay afloat with theatres closed The night London's theatres went dark ""Restarting Broadway is a complex endeavour,"" Charlotte St Martin, president of the Broadway League, an industry group, told the Reuters news agency. ""Today's green light by the governor to put our shows on sale now for the fall is vital to our success."" Safety procedures are still being ironed out, with one possibility being a requirement for audience members to show proof of vaccination. ""We've never done this before,"" Victoria Bailey, executive director of TDF, a non-profit organisation which oversees a ticket-selling booth in Times Square,told the New York Times.,external ""The last time the theatre industry opened from a pandemic, Shakespeare was still writing new plays.""

Some productions, including Mean Girls and Frozen, will not be returning for the reopening. Broadway supports more than 96,000 jobs in New York and contributed nearly $15bn (Â£11.2bn) to the city's economy in 2019, according to the Broadway League, a theatre union. That number does not just take into account ticket sales but also the investment to put on and run a show, and the money tourists spend when they come to New York to see a performance.

French power threat 'unacceptable',"The Government of Jersey granted 41 licences to French fishing boats on Friday A French government threat to cut off Jersey's electricity over a post-Brexit fishing dispute was ""clearly unacceptable and disproportionate"", the UK government has said. French Maritime Minister Annick Girardinthreatened ""retaliatory measures""over the new licensing regime for fishing in Jersey's waters. About 95% of the island's electricity comes from France via undersea cables. A UK government spokesman said they were working with the EU and Jersey. ""To threaten Jersey like this is clearly unacceptable and disproportionate,"" the spokesman said. ""We are working closely with the EU and Jersey on fisheries access provisions following the end of the transition period so trust the French will use the mechanisms of our new treaty to solve problems."" The row emerged over a new licensing system for French fishing vessels. The system was introduced by the Government of Jersey under the UK-EU Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA). Jerseyissued 41 licences for access to its waters on Fridaywhen an interim agreement came to an end. The Jersey government said the permits must ""correspond to the previous activity a vessel has carried out in Jersey waters"" under the terms of the TCA and its new system was ""in line with the data submitted by the French and EU authorities"". A spokeswoman said it took French complaints over the terms of the licensing agreement ""very seriously"" and would respond, but said it had acted in ""good faith"" setting up the regime. ""The government remains committed to the sustainable management of Jersey waters for the benefit of this and future generations,"" she said. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Ian Gorst, External Relations Minister for the Government of Jersey, argued there was no justification for such severe measures. ""This is not the first threat that the French have made to either Jersey or the United Kingdom since we are into this new deal,"" he said. ""It would seem disproportionate to cut off electricity for the sake of needing to provide extra details so that we can refine the licences."" On Tuesday, he explained there was ""no time limit"" for the French fishing industry or government to provide evidence of previous activity in Jersey waters and he wanted to ""heal this relationship"". ""If French fishermen or the authorities have further evidence they would like to submit, we will update the licences to reflect that evidence."" French authorities said ""new technical measures"" for fishing off the Channel Islands had not been communicated to the EU, rendering them ""null and void"". Representatives from Normandy have closed their office in St Helier in protest of ""inexplicable conditions"" in the new scheme, which had been introduced ""against all expectations"". These include caps on the number of fishing days for different vessels, restrictions on gear and the closure of fishing areas. The UK's Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said the self-governing Crown Dependency is ""responsible for its own territorial waters"".

Jeff Bezos sets date for space sightseeing flightThe Amazon.com founder will launch people into space on his New Shepard vehicle on 20 July.Science & Environment,"New Shepard is operated from desert land in West Texas Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos is now ready to take people into space. The US entrepreneur'sBlue Origin company,externalsays it will launch a crew aboard its New Shepard rocket and capsule system on 20 July. The astronauts are likely to include company personnel, but one seat is being auctioned online. New Shepard's flights are sub-orbital. They're designed to take passengers on a straight up-and-down trip that briefly goes above 100km (62 miles). This is the so-called KÃ¡rmÃ¡n Line, which has been designated by broad international agreement as the starting point of space. ""Only 569 people have ever been over the KÃ¡rmÃ¡n Line. With our New Shepard vehicle, we're about to change that and change it dramatically,"" said Ariane Cornell, Blue Origin's director of astronaut sales. She declined to comment on whether Mr Bezos himself might be on the 20 July flight. Jeff Bezos has big ambitions, with far bigger rockets under development Blue Origin's announcement is further evidence of a resurgence in space tourism after a gap of almost 12 years. Mr Bezos's proposition is just one of several now open to the super wealthy. Rival businessman Elon Musk is expected to launch one of his SpaceX Dragonships in the autumn with an all-civilian crew aboard. It will go orbital; the capsule will stay up for several days. At 18m in height and 4m wide, New Shepard is a fully reusable, vertical takeoff, vertical landing (VTVL) space vehicle. The New Shepard capsule has six seats with large windows It operates from desert land in Van Horn in West Texas. During a flight, the booster unit lifts the pressurised passenger vessel to about 76km in altitude, where the pair then separate. Momentum carries the capsule on upwards into space, before dropping back down to the ground under three parachutes. The booster also comes home in a controlled manner, making a propulsive landing on a concrete pad. Blue Origin is hoping the New Shepard experience will prove a big draw. Passengers will experience about three minutes of weightlessness at the top of the climb. They'll also get to see the blackness of space and Earth's curved horizon. The whole system has gone through several years of rigorous testing For the moment, the company is not discussing future pricing options - just the details of the public auction for one seat on that first mission in two months' time. Blue Origin says the cash raised from this particular sale will go to its foundation that promotes science and technology education. But long-term, the company could expect to earn perhaps $200,000 (Â£143,780) per seat, maybe even more initially. ""This is a nascent market,"" said Ms Cornell. ""We're opening the doors and look forward to seeing what the market says. ""I personally think people are going to see what a cool experience this is and are going to want to do it themselves. And then, as hopefully the prices come down, the scale goes up."" The hope is that ticket prices will eventually fall Throughout the 2000s a number of high-value individuals paid to visit the International Space Station (ISS). But this tourism, organised under the patronage of the Russian space agency, ceased in 2009. Now, it seems, the sector is being rekindled. As well as the initiatives from Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk, British entrepreneur Sir Richard Branson continues to push his Virgin Galactic rocket plane concept. There are also those who want to launch private space stations this decade. Among these is Axiom, a company started by a former Nasa ISS programme manager. Blue Origin's announcement was timed to coincide with the 60th anniversary of the first spaceflight made by an American astronaut - Alan Shepard, in whose honour the new tourist vehicle is named. Alan Shepard conducted a 15-minute sub-orbital flight in his Project Mercury Freedom-7 capsule on 5 May, 1961.
