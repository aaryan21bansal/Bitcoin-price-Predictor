Javid: I resigned to uphold 'sensible' government,"This video can not be played Sajid Javid: Ministers decide on their advisers Sajid Javid has said his resignation as Chancellor was necessary to uphold the ""national interest"" and sensible ""checks and balances"" in government. He quit the cabinet in the prime minister's reshuffle after a row over merging his team with No 10's advisers. In a personal statement in the Commons explaining his decision, he defended the Treasury's independence and said it must be able to ""speak truth to power"". No 10 said having joint advisers would help government work ""effectively"". During his speech, Mr Javid warned the government not to abandon its fiscal discipline. He offered his full support to Boris Johnson and his successor as chancellor, Rishi Sunak, who watched on as Mr Javid delivered a rare personal statement setting out the reasons for his surprise exit last month. But in a warning to the PM, he said Mr Sunak - who will deliver the Budget in two weeks' time - should be given the ""space to do his job without fear or favour"". Reaction to Javid's resignation statement Sajid Javid quits as chancellor Mr Javid stood down after just over six months in the Treasury. He had been told by the PM that he would have to share his team of personal advisers with No 10 and that some of his existing staff would be let go as part of plans to create single unit. Speaking in the Commons, he said it has ""always been the case"" that ministers appointed their own advisers, and he saw no reason why the Treasury ""should be the exception to that"". The convention that ""advisers advise, ministers decide and ministers decide on their advisers"" remained a sound one, he told MPs. Analysis by BBC political correspondent Leila Nathoo MPs listening to Sajid Javid's reflections from the backbenches would have been in no doubt about who he held responsible for his resignation. Dominic Cummings was mentioned by name only in passing and in jest, but he was the central character in the statement. While not as explosive as it could have been, Mr Javid's speech pulled no punches when it came to the verdict on the new relationship between Downing Street and the Treasury: not in the national interest. The Treasury, he said, must continue to be a strong and credible institution - 'don't undermine it' was his message. And while he was full of praise for his former boss and his successor, he urged them to stick with his fiscal rules and resist the temptation to splash the cash and cut taxes. The Budget - that Mr Javid was meant to deliver in a fortnight - will reveal whether they take heed of his advice. He said he felt the order to fire his aides would ""significantly inhibit"" the flow of good advice and would not have been in the national interest as ""no particular person"" has a ""monopoly of the best ideas"". He said mutual trust and creative tension between institutions were vital to the proper functioning of government. ""It is through these checks and balances of credible institutions, be it the Treasury, the Bank of England, the Office for Budget Responsibility and this House, that we arrive in sensible decisions that are in the national interest,"" he said. The PM and his new chancellor were in the chamber to listen to Mr Javid's statement ""A chancellor, like all cabinet ministers, has to be able to give candid advice to a prime minister so he is speaking truth to power. I believe that the arrangement proposed would significantly inhibit that and it would not have been in the national interest."" He also made a joke at the expense of the PM's chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, who was widely seen as behind the plan to clip the Treasury's wings. He told MPs he did not want to go into the ""Cummings and goings"" of the row that led to his departure. While the ""tenacious and energetic"" prime minister had a once in a generation opportunity to renew and transform the country, he said the government must live within its means. As a ""low-tax Conservative"", he said he was worried that the overall tax burden was already at its highest in many years. Amid warnings from a leading economic think tank, the IFS,that the new chancellor must raise taxes in his first Budget or break the government's rules on borrowing, he said ""not everyone at the centre of government"" feels the same pressure to balance the books and the Treasury had a responsibility to keep spending and the national debt ""under control"". ""Trade-offs need to be made somewhere. When we need to do much more to level up across generations, it would not be right to pass the bill for our day-to-day consumption to our children and grandchildren. Former PM Theresa May reacts as Sajid Javid delivers his personal statement Responding immediately to Mr Javid's comments, the PM praised Mr Javid's ""immense service"" to the country and said he had ""friends and admirers"" across the House. Later, a Downing Street spokesman defended the decision to merge advisors, saying: ""The new unit will ensure that the government works more effectively to deliver the prime minister and chancellor's shared ambition to level up the economy across the UK."" The PM's official spokesman would not confirm whether the government would stick to Mr Javid's fiscal rules, adding: ""As set out in the [Conservative election] manifesto, we will continue to have a clear fiscal framework."" ""The detail of that is for the chancellor to confirm at the budget.""

Maria Sharapova retires from tennis aged 32,"This video can not be played Maria Sharapova wins Wimbledon in 2004 Five-time Grand Slam champion Maria Sharapova is ""saying goodbye"" to tennis at the age of 32. In an article written forVogue and Vanity Fair,external, Sharapova said her body ""had become a distraction"" after a struggle with shoulder injuries. The Russian won her first Grand Slam at Wimbledon in 2004 aged 17 and completed the career slam - all four major titles - by winning the French Open in 2012. In 2016, she served a 15-month ban after testing positive for meldonium. 'Sharapova retires with many questions unanswered' - Russell Fuller blog After returning from her ban in 2017, Sharapova struggled to recapture her best form and suffered from a number of injuries. She has dropped to 373 in the world, her lowest ranking since August 2002, and has lost in the first round of her past three Grand Slam tournaments. In announcing her retirement, she said: ""I'm new to this, so please forgive me. Tennis - I'm saying goodbye. ""Looking back now, I realize that tennis has been my mountain. My path has been filled with valleys and detours, but the views from its peak were incredible. ""After 28 years and five Grand Slam titles, though, I'm ready to scale another mountain - to compete on a different type of terrain. ""That relentless chase for victories, though? That won't ever diminish. No matter what lies ahead, I will apply the same focus, the same work ethic, and all of the lessons I've learned along the way. ""In the meantime, there are a few simple things I'm really looking forward to: A sense of stillness with my family. Lingering over a morning cup of coffee. Unexpected weekend getaways. Workouts of my choice (hello, dance class!)"" Sharapova said her 6-1 6-1first-round defeat by Serena Williamsat last year's US Open was the ""final signal"". ""Behind closed doors, 30 minutes before taking the court, I had a procedure to numb my shoulder to get through the match,"" she said, ""Shoulder injuries are nothing new for me - over time my tendons have frayed like a string. I've had multiple surgeries - once in 2008, another procedure last year - and spent countless months in physical therapy. ""Just stepping on to the court that day felt like a final victory, when of course it should have been merely the first step toward victory."" Sharapova did not play again in 2019 after that defeat at Flushing Meadows and has played just twice this year, including astraight sets loss to Croat Donna Vekicin the Australian Open first round, her last competitive appearance.. Maria Sharapova is the third-youngest woman to win the Wimbledon singles title after Lottie Dod and Martina Hingis Sharapova shot to stardom in 2004 aged just 17 when victory over Serena Williams saw her become the third-youngest woman to win the Wimbledon singles title. She would go on to become one of the most high-profile names in women's sport, winning 36 singles titles and earning more than $38m (Â£29m) in prize money. In 2005 she became the first Russian woman to become world number one, and won her second Grand Slam singles title at the US Open the following year. But 2007 saw the first of Sharapova's struggles with injury, as she missed most of the clay court season with a shoulder problem. She would return to form and fitness to win the Australian Open at the start of 2008, but a second shoulder injury kept her off tour for the second half of the season, meaning she missed the US Open and Beijing Olympics. In 2012, Sharapova captured the French Open at Roland Garros to become the 10th woman to complete the career Grand Slam, before winning Olympic silver in London. Yet another shoulder injury saw her miss the second half of the 2013 season, although she returned the following year to win her second French Open, and fifth and final Grand Slam. This video can not be played Archive: 'I admitted my mistake - now I'm back' In March 2016, Sharapova told a news conference she had tested positive for meldonium at the Australian Open. Meldonium, a heart disease drug, became a banned substance on 1 January 2016. Sharapova said she had been taking the drug since 2006 for health problems and was unaware it had been added to the banned list, insisting she had ""not tried to use a performance-enhancing substance"". She was banned for two years, later reduced to 15 months following an appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. She returned to tennis in April 2017, winning what would be her final career singles title at the Tianjin Open in October that year. Sharapova reached the quarter-finals at the 2018 French Open and the last 16 of the Australian Open at the start of 2019, but injuries and loss of form began to take its toll. Following Sharapova's announcement, hercoachRiccardo Piattitweeted: ""It's been an honour to have worked with such an amazing athlete and person. I'll miss her on court and outside. I'm sorry we couldn't work together for longer. But I know our paths will cross again and I can't wait for it. In the meantime, good luck with everything."" Two-time Grand Slam championPetra Kvitovasaid it had been ""a pleasure"" to share a court with Sharapova. The Czech added: ""We always had great battles when we played and I have so much respect for your hard work and the way you always fight for everything. You have achieved a lot in your life and I know this is just the start."" Meanwhile, tennis legendBillie Jean Kingadded: ""From the day Maria Sharapova won her first Wimbledon title at age 17, she has been a great champion. A five-time major champion and a former world number one, her business success is just as impressive as her tennis achievements. Maria, the best is yet to come for you!"" Reacting after his victory over Philipp Kohlschreiber at the Dubai Open on Wednesday, world number one men's playerNovak Djokovicasked the crowd to offer a round of applause for Sharapova. ""She is a great fighter, as dedicated as someone can really be in our sport,"" the Serbian 17-time Grand Slam champion said. ""The will power and willingness to overcome the obstacle she had, with her injuries and surgeries and trying to fight to come back to the court and play at her desired level - it's truly inspirational to see what a mind of a champion she has. At the end of a fantastic career she can be proud of herself.""

Parents warned ahead of Greta Thunberg protest,"Greta Thunberg tweeted over the weekend that she would be taking part in the city's youth protest Police are warning parents a Bristol protest Greta Thunberg is due to join has ""grown so large"" it is unlikely usual safety measures will be adequate. Avon and Somerset Police say they expect thousands of people at the Bristol Youth Strike 4 Climate on College Green on Friday to hear the 17-year-old climate activist speak. The force said there was ""potential for trips, slips, falls and crushing"". Parents and carers were advised to make their own safety arrangements. The Swedish climate change campaigner tweeted over the weekend that she would be taking part in the city's youth protest.

""Social media has gone viral with interest which leads me to believe it will be thousands of people,"" he wrote.

""In terms of big crowds, they are dynamic in nature and there is the potential for trips, slips, falls and crushing,"" he warned parents. ""The event has grown so large that the usual controls, stewarding and safety measures that are routinely put in place are unlikely to be scaled up adequately."" He added Park Street and the city centre would also be closed to ""try and mitigate the risks associated with a crowd too large for the College Green open space"".

Fall in bus travel as car ownership hits recordThe number of journeys made by public transport in Scotland drops while the number of cars hits three million.Scotland,"The number of people travelling by bus in Scotland has dropped by 10% in five years,according to new figures,external. Data released by the Scottish government also showed that car travel increased, with a record three million cars now registered in Scotland. Overall, the number of journeys made by public transport in Scotland fell by eight million - from 525m to 517m - over the past year. Bus journeys accounted for 73% of all those taken by public transport. Despite the drop in bus travel, ScotRail saw 13% more passenger journeys compared with five years ago.  8 millionfewer journeys 3 millioncars now registered in Scotland - an all-time high 27%increase in air journeys in five years 10%decline in bus journeys in five years Over the same period, Scottish airports also saw passenger numbers increase, with a 27% rise to 29.4m. That included a 2% rise in the past year. Cycling has also increased in popularity, with an 8% increase since 2017 in the distance cycled on the road network. There were 10.3m ferry passengers in 2018 - with 8.5m on routes entirely within Scotland. Over five years, passenger numbers were up 6%. Transport Secretary Michael Matheson said the decline in bus journeys had been happening across the UK since the 1960s. He added that the future of bus travel in Scotland had ""never been brighter"", adding that nearly three quarters of public transport journeys were made by bus. Mr Matheson said: ""We have committed to bringing forward transformational funding of more than half a billion pounds to create a Bus Partnership Fund for local authorities, and to roll out infrastructure for the trunk road network, to prioritise buses in congested areas. ""This is intended to improve punctuality and reliability and, importantly, to leverage further action and investment from local authorities and bus operators to encourage more people to take the bus every day. ""This is in addition to over Â£260m we spend every year to keep fares at affordable levels and providing free bus travel to older and disabled passengers."" Gina Hanrahan, of WWF Scotland said transport is Scotland's biggest source of emissions. She said the figures are ""continuing to go in the wrong direction"". She added: ""In order to get people out of their cars, and encourage them to use other modes of transport, we need greater investment in cleaner forms of transport to tackle climate change, clean up our dirty air and enhance public health. ""We need to see really clear shifts in the final budget and the infrastructure investment plan to support this."" There's been a long-term fall in bus travel in Scotland. Journeys almost halved between 1960 and 1975, and they've roughly halved again since then. Some blame Margaret Thatcher's deregulation of the bus network in the mid-eighties. That allows bus companies to cherry pick the routes they want to serve - and which they don't. But the decline isn't uniform. Edinburgh's not seen a slump in bus travel. It helps that fares in the capital are cheaper than in Glasgow, and that Lothian Buses operates on a dense network of routes. While passenger numbers fell by 10% in five years across Scotland, Edinburgh has seen a different pattern. Bus use has remained rock-steady since 2014. Lothian buses even expect passenger numbers to grow. In Edinburgh buses are a municipal service. Lothian Buses is council-owned. And if there's a lesson from Edinburgh, when fares are competitive, and the bus network is extensive, people will still take the bus. Last year, the Scottish government brought in changes to try to reinvigorate Scotland's bus network and boost bus passenger numbers. If today's figures are anything to go by - they have their work cut out.

Woman in court for dropping Greggs bag in 2009,"Vegan sausage rolls weren't on the menu when Grace Firth dropped a Greggs bag in 2009 More than 10 years ago, Grace Firth tucked into a snack from Greggs. Somehow, the paper bag ended up on the ground rather than in the bin. Now the 32-year-old student from Stockport has found herself in court, accused of littering. Magistrates even questioned whether the date of the offence was a mistake because of how long ago it happened. It took so long to be resolved because Grace said she knew nothing about the original prosecution. She had been convicted in her absence in August 2009, fined Â£175 and ordered to pay Â£180 costs and a Â£15 victim surcharge. But Grace told Stockport Magistrates' Court the first she'd heard about the whole thing was when she got a letter on 8 December 2019 regarding an ""historical debt"". She said she had never received any letters before then, since they had been sent to her mum's house. ""Any mail for me was returned to sender or thrown away,"" she told the court. On Tuesday, magistrates accepted her explanation and decided to cancel the original Â£180 costs order. Chairman Edward Tasker told her: ""You've been very fair and very honest,"" before also reducing her fine to Â£40 plus the Â£15 victim surcharge. ""Thank you for being so honest and for turning up,"" he added.

Yousef Makki, 17, was stabbed in the heart with a flick knife However, Molnar falsely suggested Yousef had been stabbed by someone who drove off in a grey VW Polo, information which was circulated on the police network. Molnar was sentenced to be detained for eight months and given a training order, after he admitted perverting the course of justice and possession of a knife. At the time, Yousef's family described the sentence as ""disappointing"". Family's plea for full Yousef Makki inquest Boy who stabbed friend in heart named Accused 'moonwalked past victim's family' In a statement on Tuesday, they wrote: ""To receive the news some six days before such a pivotal date in the lives of Yousef's many friends and family members, is simply crushing.

London firms send staff home amid coronavirus fear,"Some people in London have taken to wearing face masks on the Tube Three firms in London have now asked staff to work from home as a precaution against coronavirus. Oil giant Chevron has asked 300 staff not to come into its office in Canary Wharf ""for the time being"". Crossrail, which shares the same building as Chevron, and media firm OMD, based in central London, have also asked staff to stay away. The real estate company that manages Canary Wharf suggested the firms had reacted with ""an abundance of caution"". It ""strongly encouraged"" its tenants to adhere to advice from Public Health England, which says there is no need to send staff home, as most possible cases turn out to be negative. PHE says even if there is a confirmed case of coronavirus they do not recommend closing the workplace. In the UK, there have been 7,132 coronavirus tests carried out since the outbreak began to spread beyond China in January. Of these, 13 were confirmed positive - including four people who returned from the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan. How worried should we be? Will I get paid if I self-isolate? Your rights as a traveller OMD, which is part of Omnicom Media Group, said an employee reported symptoms after returning from Australia with a flight connection through Singapore. The firm said the chance that it was the coronavirus was minimal but that it was asking staff to work from home ""as a precautionary measure, and until definitive results of the employee's coronavirus test is confirmed"". Crossrail and OMD did not say how many employees were affected. Chevron and Crossrail share the same building in Westferry Circus, London Chevron said one of its employees spent the weekend skiing in Italy, a coronavirus hotspot, then returned to work on Monday. They started feeling unwell and did not go to work on Tuesday. Following NHS advice, the employee reported to hospital to be tested for the infection and is awaiting the results. The company said it would continue to monitor the situation very closely but in the meantime was taking precautionary measures to reduce its employees' ""risk of exposure"". In other developments in the UK: Tests for the new coronavirus are being increasedto provide officials with an early warning if the infection is spreading Employers had been sent guidance telling them staff who are asked to self-isolate are entitled to take sick leave Several schools have sent pupils home or closed after they returned from skiing trips in northern Italy over half term British Airways has cancelled some of its flights to Milan because the coronavirus outbreak had resulted in ""reduced demand"" Other firms have taken precautions to protect staff from the risk of catching the coronavirus. BP has delayed all non-essential business travel to China, Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea and Singapore until further notice. Investment bank Goldman Sachs has told staff who have returned from affected areas to self-isolate even if they show no symptoms. Josh Hardie, CBI deputy director-general, said firms should follow official government guidance. ""In a fast-evolving situation, businesses will be mindful of the potential risks. The health of employees must be their first consideration, as well as the potential impact on their operations,"" he added. The new coronavirus strain, which causes Covid-19, has caused widespread disruption around the world. Businesses and factories across China have been disrupted since January and the disease has spread to 27 other countries, including the UK. Based on data from 44,000 patients with this coronavirus, the World Health Organization says: 81% develop mild symptoms 14% develop severe symptoms 5% become critically ill On Tuesday, UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock said that Britons returning from quarantined Italian towns should isolate themselves, even if they have no symptoms. Workers who are ill are entitled to statutory sick pay. But the law says that if you stay away from work but aren't sick, you may not get paid. This video can not be played Coronavirus in the UK: 5 things you need to know about Covid-19 The main signs of infection are fever (high temperature) and a cough as well as shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. Frequent handwashing with soap or gel, avoiding close contact with people who are ill and not touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands can help cut the risk of infection. Catching coughs and sneezes in a tissue, binning it and washing your hands can minimise the risk of spreading disease. People with concerns should call the NHS on 111.

"'No excuses for not cutting crime', police told","Priti Patel told a crime conference she would be ""unapologetic"" about holding police to account There must be ""no excuses"" for not cutting crime, Home Secretary Priti Patel has told senior police officers. Speaking at a conference in central London, Ms Patel signalled the return of national targets, saying ""outcomes"" in key areas would be measured. The home secretary added she would be ""unapologetic"" about holding police to account. It came as ministers continued to dismiss allegations of bullying in the Home Office. 'More than 50,000 new police officers needed' Recruitment of 20,000 police to begin 'in weeks' Have police numbers dropped? Prime Minister Boris Johnson has pledged to recruit 20,000 new police officers in England and Wales within three years - almost reversing the reduction in numbers since the Conservatives came to power in 2010. Speaking at the the National Police Chiefs' Council and Association of Police and Crime Commissioners summit in Westminster, Ms Patel said she expected people to be able to see a difference when the new officers were in post, such as less crime and safer streets. She said success would be measured against a set of national policing outcomes, with priorities including reducing murders, serious violence and neighbourhood crime. Ms Patel said she was ""unequivocal"" in her support for officers, but added: ""We need to pull out all the stops to deliver the decline in crime that people want to see. There must be no weak spots. ""These outcomes will be non-negotiable and I will be unapologetic about holding you to account."" Priti Patel's message to the police was blunt: we're investing in you, now you must deliver. This will have come as little surprise to the chief constables gathered at the conference - a government which has made law and order a priority expects results. But the means by which ministers will gauge success - national ""outcomes"", or targets in all but name - are likely to cause concern. The last time national crime indicators were brought in, under Tony Blair's Labour administration, they had a series of unintended consequences, as certain serious offences, which were not being measured, weren't given the attention they should have been. The three-year deadline for reductions in crime set by the home secretary is also hugely ambitious. But the clear goal she has set is likely to be welcomed by the public, which, as she acknowledged in her speech, has lost confidence in the criminal justice system. Ms Patel's speech came as ministers continued todismiss allegations of bullying in the Home Officeafter claims she clashed with senior officials, belittled colleagues and is distrusted by intelligence chiefs. Ms Patel and permanent secretary Sir Philip Rutnam released a joint statement denying reports of a deep rift at the top of the department, while allies described her as a ""demanding"" boss but not a bully. Earlier, police minister Kit Malthouse insisted there was ""glutinous harmony"" in the department and he had not witnessed bullying by his boss. The reports of feuding prompted the head of the Civil Service, Sir Mark Sedwill, to order an end to media leaks in a missive to government staff. Ministers have continued to dismiss allegations Ms Patel bullied her staff Also in her speech, Ms Patel announced Â£41.5m of funding for forces in 18 areas worst affected by serious violence, and launched an eight-week consultation on plans to enshrine a police covenant in law. The plan, first mooted in the Conservative Party's general election manifesto, pledges to back the rights of serving or ex-police officers, staff and their families, recognise the responsibility and risks officers take, and introduce a code of ethics. The Police Federation of England and Wales welcomed the plans. National chairman John Apter said: ""Policing is a dangerous and unpredictable job and it's essential that there is something in place that ensures that police officers, staff, retired colleagues and their families receive the support they deserve. ""This consultation is an opportunity to help shape what a police covenant will look like. This is something I feel extremely passionate about and it's great to see this taking a step closer to becoming a reality.""

"Maria Sharapova retires from tennis aged 32The five-time grand slam champion is ""saying goodbye"" to tennis after a struggle with injuries.","This video can not be played Maria Sharapova wins Wimbledon in 2004 Five-time Grand Slam champion Maria Sharapova is ""saying goodbye"" to tennis at the age of 32. In an article written forVogue and Vanity Fair,external, Sharapova said her body ""had become a distraction"" after a struggle with shoulder injuries. The Russian won her first Grand Slam at Wimbledon in 2004 aged 17 and completed the career slam - all four major titles - by winning the French Open in 2012. In 2016, she served a 15-month ban after testing positive for meldonium. 'Sharapova retires with many questions unanswered' - Russell Fuller blog After returning from her ban in 2017, Sharapova struggled to recapture her best form and suffered from a number of injuries. She has dropped to 373 in the world, her lowest ranking since August 2002, and has lost in the first round of her past three Grand Slam tournaments. In announcing her retirement, she said: ""I'm new to this, so please forgive me. Tennis - I'm saying goodbye. ""Looking back now, I realize that tennis has been my mountain. My path has been filled with valleys and detours, but the views from its peak were incredible. ""After 28 years and five Grand Slam titles, though, I'm ready to scale another mountain - to compete on a different type of terrain. ""That relentless chase for victories, though? That won't ever diminish. No matter what lies ahead, I will apply the same focus, the same work ethic, and all of the lessons I've learned along the way. ""In the meantime, there are a few simple things I'm really looking forward to: A sense of stillness with my family. Lingering over a morning cup of coffee. Unexpected weekend getaways. Workouts of my choice (hello, dance class!)"" Sharapova said her 6-1 6-1first-round defeat by Serena Williamsat last year's US Open was the ""final signal"". ""Behind closed doors, 30 minutes before taking the court, I had a procedure to numb my shoulder to get through the match,"" she said, ""Shoulder injuries are nothing new for me - over time my tendons have frayed like a string. I've had multiple surgeries - once in 2008, another procedure last year - and spent countless months in physical therapy. ""Just stepping on to the court that day felt like a final victory, when of course it should have been merely the first step toward victory."" Sharapova did not play again in 2019 after that defeat at Flushing Meadows and has played just twice this year, including astraight sets loss to Croat Donna Vekicin the Australian Open first round, her last competitive appearance.. Maria Sharapova is the third-youngest woman to win the Wimbledon singles title after Lottie Dod and Martina Hingis Sharapova shot to stardom in 2004 aged just 17 when victory over Serena Williams saw her become the third-youngest woman to win the Wimbledon singles title. She would go on to become one of the most high-profile names in women's sport, winning 36 singles titles and earning more than $38m (Â£29m) in prize money. In 2005 she became the first Russian woman to become world number one, and won her second Grand Slam singles title at the US Open the following year. But 2007 saw the first of Sharapova's struggles with injury, as she missed most of the clay court season with a shoulder problem. She would return to form and fitness to win the Australian Open at the start of 2008, but a second shoulder injury kept her off tour for the second half of the season, meaning she missed the US Open and Beijing Olympics. In 2012, Sharapova captured the French Open at Roland Garros to become the 10th woman to complete the career Grand Slam, before winning Olympic silver in London. Yet another shoulder injury saw her miss the second half of the 2013 season, although she returned the following year to win her second French Open, and fifth and final Grand Slam. This video can not be played Archive: 'I admitted my mistake - now I'm back' In March 2016, Sharapova told a news conference she had tested positive for meldonium at the Australian Open. Meldonium, a heart disease drug, became a banned substance on 1 January 2016. Sharapova said she had been taking the drug since 2006 for health problems and was unaware it had been added to the banned list, insisting she had ""not tried to use a performance-enhancing substance"". She was banned for two years, later reduced to 15 months following an appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. She returned to tennis in April 2017, winning what would be her final career singles title at the Tianjin Open in October that year. Sharapova reached the quarter-finals at the 2018 French Open and the last 16 of the Australian Open at the start of 2019, but injuries and loss of form began to take its toll. Following Sharapova's announcement, hercoachRiccardo Piattitweeted: ""It's been an honour to have worked with such an amazing athlete and person. I'll miss her on court and outside. I'm sorry we couldn't work together for longer. But I know our paths will cross again and I can't wait for it. In the meantime, good luck with everything."" Two-time Grand Slam championPetra Kvitovasaid it had been ""a pleasure"" to share a court with Sharapova. The Czech added: ""We always had great battles when we played and I have so much respect for your hard work and the way you always fight for everything. You have achieved a lot in your life and I know this is just the start."" Meanwhile, tennis legendBillie Jean Kingadded: ""From the day Maria Sharapova won her first Wimbledon title at age 17, she has been a great champion. A five-time major champion and a former world number one, her business success is just as impressive as her tennis achievements. Maria, the best is yet to come for you!"" Reacting after his victory over Philipp Kohlschreiber at the Dubai Open on Wednesday, world number one men's playerNovak Djokovicasked the crowd to offer a round of applause for Sharapova. ""She is a great fighter, as dedicated as someone can really be in our sport,"" the Serbian 17-time Grand Slam champion said. ""The will power and willingness to overcome the obstacle she had, with her injuries and surgeries and trying to fight to come back to the court and play at her desired level - it's truly inspirational to see what a mind of a champion she has. At the end of a fantastic career she can be proud of herself.""

Fall in bus travel as car ownership hits record,"The number of people travelling by bus in Scotland has dropped by 10% in five years,according to new figures,external. Data released by the Scottish government also showed that car travel increased, with a record three million cars now registered in Scotland. Overall, the number of journeys made by public transport in Scotland fell by eight million - from 525m to 517m - over the past year. Bus journeys accounted for 73% of all those taken by public transport. Despite the drop in bus travel, ScotRail saw 13% more passenger journeys compared with five years ago.  8 millionfewer journeys 3 millioncars now registered in Scotland - an all-time high 27%increase in air journeys in five years 10%decline in bus journeys in five years Over the same period, Scottish airports also saw passenger numbers increase, with a 27% rise to 29.4m. That included a 2% rise in the past year. Cycling has also increased in popularity, with an 8% increase since 2017 in the distance cycled on the road network. There were 10.3m ferry passengers in 2018 - with 8.5m on routes entirely within Scotland. Over five years, passenger numbers were up 6%. Transport Secretary Michael Matheson said the decline in bus journeys had been happening across the UK since the 1960s. He added that the future of bus travel in Scotland had ""never been brighter"", adding that nearly three quarters of public transport journeys were made by bus. Mr Matheson said: ""We have committed to bringing forward transformational funding of more than half a billion pounds to create a Bus Partnership Fund for local authorities, and to roll out infrastructure for the trunk road network, to prioritise buses in congested areas. ""This is intended to improve punctuality and reliability and, importantly, to leverage further action and investment from local authorities and bus operators to encourage more people to take the bus every day. ""This is in addition to over Â£260m we spend every year to keep fares at affordable levels and providing free bus travel to older and disabled passengers."" Gina Hanrahan, of WWF Scotland said transport is Scotland's biggest source of emissions. She said the figures are ""continuing to go in the wrong direction"". She added: ""In order to get people out of their cars, and encourage them to use other modes of transport, we need greater investment in cleaner forms of transport to tackle climate change, clean up our dirty air and enhance public health. ""We need to see really clear shifts in the final budget and the infrastructure investment plan to support this."" There's been a long-term fall in bus travel in Scotland. Journeys almost halved between 1960 and 1975, and they've roughly halved again since then. Some blame Margaret Thatcher's deregulation of the bus network in the mid-eighties. That allows bus companies to cherry pick the routes they want to serve - and which they don't. But the decline isn't uniform. Edinburgh's not seen a slump in bus travel. It helps that fares in the capital are cheaper than in Glasgow, and that Lothian Buses operates on a dense network of routes. While passenger numbers fell by 10% in five years across Scotland, Edinburgh has seen a different pattern. Bus use has remained rock-steady since 2014. Lothian buses even expect passenger numbers to grow. In Edinburgh buses are a municipal service. Lothian Buses is council-owned. And if there's a lesson from Edinburgh, when fares are competitive, and the bus network is extensive, people will still take the bus. Last year, the Scottish government brought in changes to try to reinvigorate Scotland's bus network and boost bus passenger numbers. If today's figures are anything to go by - they have their work cut out.

SNP and Greens agree Scottish budget deal,"Finance Secretary Kate Forbes and Green co-leader Patrick Harvie welcomed the agreement The Scottish government is to set up a free bus travel scheme for under-19s as part of an SNP-Green budget deal. The agreement between the two parties will also see extra funding going to local government and the police. Finance Secretary Kate Forbes said free bus travel would be a ""step change"" in supporting young people and helping tackle climate change. MSPs will vote on the budget for the first time on Thursday, with the tax and spending plans now certain to pass. No changes to tax rates in Scottish budget Ms Forbes stepped in to deliver the budget the day afterDerek Mackay resignedas finance secretary, and was subsequently appointed to replace him. The budget does not contain any changes to income tax rates, with extra money being spent on health, education and investment aimed at tackling the ""climate emergency"". Draft Income Tax plan 19%Starter rate 20%Basic rate 21%Intermediate rate 41%Higher rate 46%Top rate The commitment to set up a free public transport scheme for young people comes on the same day asfigures showed fewer people were using buses. Ministers aim to have ""national concessionary travel"" system up and running by January 2021, with people aged 18 and under joining the over-60s in being eligible for free bus trips. The deal with the Greens will also see an extra Â£95m going to local authorities, as well as Â£18m to police services and Â£45m to low carbon projects, including energy efficiency projects and active travel. The changes will be paid for using underspends, longer term income from non-domestic rates and the fossil fuel levy. The government has also agreed to review plans toupgrade the Sheriffhall roundabout,externalon the Edinburgh bypass, although ministers have rejected calls from the Greens to scrap works on the A9 and A96. MSPs will vote on the initial proposals on Thursday, with the terms of the deal with the Greens to be added in the following week when the budget is examined by a committee of MSPs. The tax rates are expected to be signed off on Wednesday 4 March, with the final vote on the budget bill the following day. Ms Forbes stepped in to deliver the budget after the resignation of Derek Mackay Ms Forbes said she was ""pleased to have reached an agreement"", particularly given the ""uncertainty"" of the UK government not yet having set its budget. She said the budget included ""record investment"" in health services and ""significant investments to tackle the climate crisis"". She said: ""I want to thank all parties for the constructive way in which they have approached this year's discussions. ""While it is not possible to meet every party's demands in full, I believe in reaching formal agreement with the Green Party I am also delivering on key asks from every party and I encourage all MSPs to consider giving their support to Scotland's budget."" Green co-leader Patrick Harvie said free bus travel would be a ""transformational step towards tackling the climate emergency"". He added: ""Clearly, a Green budget would do even more to tackle the climate emergency, but securing this important free bus travel deal for the next generation builds on the powers we won for local councils to take control of local bus services."" The other opposition parties had also been involved in talks with Ms Forbes, but hit out at the deal. The Scottish Conservatives said the plan announced on Wednesday ""still falls well short of what our economy and public services need"", with finance spokesman Donald Cameron saying Tory MSPs would not back the budget unless extra cash was added for drug rehabilitation services. Scottish Labour, which had called for a wider free bus travel system, said it was ""deeply disappointing to see the Scottish Green Party yet again sell our local councils, our environment and indeed themselves short yet again"". The Scottish Lib Dems meanwhile said they would vote against the budget as long as the SNP continued to push for an independence referendum in 2020, with leader Willie Rennie saying this was ""stopping an awful lot else being agreed"".

US warns of 'inevitable' spread,"A Kobe Bryant fan wears a mask to his memorial service in LA on Monday Health officials in the US have warned Americans to brace for the ""inevitable"" spread of the coronavirus disease that is sweeping the world. There are 53 confirmed cases in the US, and officials are calling on Congress to urgently pass billions of dollars to fund the response effort. On Wednesday in South Korea, the first case of coronavirus in the US military was confirmed at a military base. The 23-year-old soldier is now under self-quarantine,US Forces Korea said.,external President Trump had claimed that the spread of coronavirus was ""well under control"". More than 2,700 people have died and some 80,000 have been taken ill, mostly in China where the virus originated. Outside China, Iran, South Korea and Italy have reported the largest number of cases causing concern that the virus could be becoming a pandemic. The first positive virus test has been recorded in Latin America - a 61-year-old Brazilian resident who had just returned from Italy.  Local media reported that the man would be tested again for final confirmation. On Tuesday, US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and Prevention experts warned Americans of the coming outbreak. ""We are asking the American public to prepare for the expectation that this might be bad,"" said Dr Nancy Messonnier of the National Center for Immunisation and Respiratory Diseases in a conference call with reporters on Tuesday. ""It's not so much a question of if this will happen in this country any more but a question of when this will happen,"" she said, adding: ""Disruption to everyday life might be severe."" What is coronavirus and what are the symptoms? Analysis: How close are we to a pandemic? The warning marks a change of tone for the CDC, which, until now, has largely been focused on efforts to stop the contagion from entering the country and on quarantining people who have travelled from China.

So far, 14 patients have been diagnosed with Covid-19 inside the US, while another 39 people have been diagnosed outside the US but are being treated in the country. A pharmacy in California warns of shortages in gloves and masks CDC health officials have outlined measures that schools and business may need to take, including limiting the size of classrooms, and employing ""internet-based tele-schooling"". ""For adults, businesses can replace in-person meetings with video or telephone conferences and increase tele-working options,"" said Dr Messonnier. Hospitals also may need to postpone elective surgeries, she warned, and increase video conferencing capabilities for treating patients remotely. A vaccine will not be ready for more than a year, they say. Meanwhile US Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Alex Azar has asked a Senate subcommittee to approve $2.5 bn (Â£1.9 bn) in funding to fight the outbreak. ""We cannot hermetically seal off the United States to a virus,"" he told lawmakers. ""And we need to be realistic about that."" The money, he said, would pay for the US to expand its surveillance systems for the virus, would support local and state governments, and would help scientists develop vaccines. Fears of a pandemic sent the Dow Jones and S&P 500 stock indices tumbling. The US indices saw their biggest four day percentage drop since December 2018. Mr Azar also said the US needed to expand its stockpiles of protective equipment, like surgical masks. He said that right now the US has a stockpile of about 30 million masks, but it actually needs 300 million to supply to healthcare workers. Earlier in the day President Donald Trump told reporters during a news conference in India that the disease is ""very well under control in our country"". ""I think the whole situation will start working out,"" he added. What you need to know A visual guide to the outbreak Tell us how you've been affected by emailinghaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external.

"Maria Sharapova retires from tennis aged 32The five-time grand slam champion is ""saying goodbye"" to tennis after a struggle with injuries.BBC Sport","This video can not be played Maria Sharapova wins Wimbledon in 2004 Five-time Grand Slam champion Maria Sharapova is ""saying goodbye"" to tennis at the age of 32. In an article written forVogue and Vanity Fair,external, Sharapova said her body ""had become a distraction"" after a struggle with shoulder injuries. The Russian won her first Grand Slam at Wimbledon in 2004 aged 17 and completed the career slam - all four major titles - by winning the French Open in 2012. In 2016, she served a 15-month ban after testing positive for meldonium. 'Sharapova retires with many questions unanswered' - Russell Fuller blog After returning from her ban in 2017, Sharapova struggled to recapture her best form and suffered from a number of injuries. She has dropped to 373 in the world, her lowest ranking since August 2002, and has lost in the first round of her past three Grand Slam tournaments. In announcing her retirement, she said: ""I'm new to this, so please forgive me. Tennis - I'm saying goodbye. ""Looking back now, I realize that tennis has been my mountain. My path has been filled with valleys and detours, but the views from its peak were incredible. ""After 28 years and five Grand Slam titles, though, I'm ready to scale another mountain - to compete on a different type of terrain. ""That relentless chase for victories, though? That won't ever diminish. No matter what lies ahead, I will apply the same focus, the same work ethic, and all of the lessons I've learned along the way. ""In the meantime, there are a few simple things I'm really looking forward to: A sense of stillness with my family. Lingering over a morning cup of coffee. Unexpected weekend getaways. Workouts of my choice (hello, dance class!)"" Sharapova said her 6-1 6-1first-round defeat by Serena Williamsat last year's US Open was the ""final signal"". ""Behind closed doors, 30 minutes before taking the court, I had a procedure to numb my shoulder to get through the match,"" she said, ""Shoulder injuries are nothing new for me - over time my tendons have frayed like a string. I've had multiple surgeries - once in 2008, another procedure last year - and spent countless months in physical therapy. ""Just stepping on to the court that day felt like a final victory, when of course it should have been merely the first step toward victory."" Sharapova did not play again in 2019 after that defeat at Flushing Meadows and has played just twice this year, including astraight sets loss to Croat Donna Vekicin the Australian Open first round, her last competitive appearance.. Maria Sharapova is the third-youngest woman to win the Wimbledon singles title after Lottie Dod and Martina Hingis Sharapova shot to stardom in 2004 aged just 17 when victory over Serena Williams saw her become the third-youngest woman to win the Wimbledon singles title. She would go on to become one of the most high-profile names in women's sport, winning 36 singles titles and earning more than $38m (Â£29m) in prize money. In 2005 she became the first Russian woman to become world number one, and won her second Grand Slam singles title at the US Open the following year. But 2007 saw the first of Sharapova's struggles with injury, as she missed most of the clay court season with a shoulder problem. She would return to form and fitness to win the Australian Open at the start of 2008, but a second shoulder injury kept her off tour for the second half of the season, meaning she missed the US Open and Beijing Olympics. In 2012, Sharapova captured the French Open at Roland Garros to become the 10th woman to complete the career Grand Slam, before winning Olympic silver in London.

Sharapova said she had been taking the drug since 2006 for health problems and was unaware it had been added to the banned list, insisting she had ""not tried to use a performance-enhancing substance"". She was banned for two years, later reduced to 15 months following an appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. She returned to tennis in April 2017, winning what would be her final career singles title at the Tianjin Open in October that year.

Woman in court for dropping Greggs bag in 2009Grace Firth was fined Â£40 after pleading guilty to a littering offence which happened in March 2009.,"Vegan sausage rolls weren't on the menu when Grace Firth dropped a Greggs bag in 2009 More than 10 years ago, Grace Firth tucked into a snack from Greggs. Somehow, the paper bag ended up on the ground rather than in the bin. Now the 32-year-old student from Stockport has found herself in court, accused of littering. Magistrates even questioned whether the date of the offence was a mistake because of how long ago it happened. It took so long to be resolved because Grace said she knew nothing about the original prosecution. She had been convicted in her absence in August 2009, fined Â£175 and ordered to pay Â£180 costs and a Â£15 victim surcharge. But Grace told Stockport Magistrates' Court the first she'd heard about the whole thing was when she got a letter on 8 December 2019 regarding an ""historical debt"". She said she had never received any letters before then, since they had been sent to her mum's house. ""Any mail for me was returned to sender or thrown away,"" she told the court. On Tuesday, magistrates accepted her explanation and decided to cancel the original Â£180 costs order. Chairman Edward Tasker told her: ""You've been very fair and very honest,"" before also reducing her fine to Â£40 plus the Â£15 victim surcharge. ""Thank you for being so honest and for turning up,"" he added.

Facebook dramas 'consuming council's energy',"The report found a ""debilitating lack of capacity and resilience"" at Merthyr Tydfil council Political dramas on Facebook are consuming enormous energy at a local authority at the expense of other matters, a review has found. Senior officers at Merthyr Tydfil County Borough Council are being asked to be ""referees"" rather than advisors. The council is only just ""keeping its nostrils above the waterline"" and has a projected deficit of Â£15m to 2022-23. Council leader Kevin O'Neill said a decade of austerity had put the council under pressure. Last year the Welsh Government sent in former Swindon council chief executive John Gilbert to advise the authorityafter council leader Kevin O'Neill asked for help. A subsequent review by animprovement board,externalchaired by former Welsh Local Government Association chief executive Steve Thomas found a ""debilitating lack of capacity and resilience"" throughout the council, with the organisation functioning ""by keeping its nostrils above the waterline"". It said there was an ""urgent need"" to address ""poor attainment levels"" in schools, and a ""complete breakdown of trust"" between the council and the trust which runs some leisure services. Council leader Kevin O'Neill asked for help for the authority last year The report says that across the council ""there are political 'hotspots' and 'dramas"" associated ""with a variety of issues"". ""Much of this plays out on social media sites especially Facebook,"" it said. ""The team fully accepts that this is part of the cut and thrust of local politics. ""But in the case of Merthyr Tydfil this can consume enormous organisational energy often at the expense of more important matters."" ""With the debilitating lack of capacity highlighted in this report the council can ill afford to be subsumed by this. ""Senior officers are all too often being asked to play the role of ""referees"" as opposed to professional advisors. This must be addressed with a clearly signalled shift in thinking from antagonistic to strategic."" Council warns of 100 job cuts to balance budget Deeply split Merthyr council seeks help BBC Wales has been told the concerns mainly relate to problems caused by councillors getting involved in rows on a private Facebook page called Merthyr Council Truths. The council's current financial plan shows projected budget deficits totalling Â£15m over the next three financial years. Other problems included ""significant concerns"" about the ability of the council to deal with ""practical ongoing issues"". ""For example, the council's monitoring officer is also its sole qualified childcare lawyer providing advice, running cases and advocacy on behalf of social services,"" the report said. ""She also is responsible for HR, legal and a range of other services."" The Welsh Government is appointing extra advisers to help with education, social services, corporate governance and leader, cabinet and member development. Local government minister Julie James said there needed to be ""widespread commitment from all members and officers to achieve a sustainable future for the council and to deliver good quality services to the people of Merthyr Tydfil"". Mr O'Neill called for more cash for his council, saying a ""decade of austerity"" had put significant pressure on the council. In a statement he said said: ""The way forward now for this organisation is to build a model that suits our capacity and our resources."" ""My cabinet and senior managers are working closely together to ensure that the right systems and structures are in place to review and resource the high level of service delivery that our residents deserve,"" he said. ""The improvement and Assurance Board will continue to monitor progress,"" the leader added, saying it will report at the end of May.

Sharapova retires from tennis aged 32,"This video can not be played Maria Sharapova wins Wimbledon in 2004 Five-time Grand Slam champion Maria Sharapova is ""saying goodbye"" to tennis at the age of 32. In an article written forVogue and Vanity Fair,external, Sharapova said her body ""had become a distraction"" after a struggle with shoulder injuries. The Russian won her first Grand Slam at Wimbledon in 2004 aged 17 and completed the career slam - all four major titles - by winning the French Open in 2012. In 2016, she served a 15-month ban after testing positive for meldonium. 'Sharapova retires with many questions unanswered' - Russell Fuller blog After returning from her ban in 2017, Sharapova struggled to recapture her best form and suffered from a number of injuries. She has dropped to 373 in the world, her lowest ranking since August 2002, and has lost in the first round of her past three Grand Slam tournaments. In announcing her retirement, she said: ""I'm new to this, so please forgive me. Tennis - I'm saying goodbye. ""Looking back now, I realize that tennis has been my mountain. My path has been filled with valleys and detours, but the views from its peak were incredible. ""After 28 years and five Grand Slam titles, though, I'm ready to scale another mountain - to compete on a different type of terrain. ""That relentless chase for victories, though? That won't ever diminish. No matter what lies ahead, I will apply the same focus, the same work ethic, and all of the lessons I've learned along the way. ""In the meantime, there are a few simple things I'm really looking forward to: A sense of stillness with my family. Lingering over a morning cup of coffee. Unexpected weekend getaways. Workouts of my choice (hello, dance class!)"" Sharapova said her 6-1 6-1first-round defeat by Serena Williamsat last year's US Open was the ""final signal"". ""Behind closed doors, 30 minutes before taking the court, I had a procedure to numb my shoulder to get through the match,"" she said, ""Shoulder injuries are nothing new for me - over time my tendons have frayed like a string. I've had multiple surgeries - once in 2008, another procedure last year - and spent countless months in physical therapy. ""Just stepping on to the court that day felt like a final victory, when of course it should have been merely the first step toward victory."" Sharapova did not play again in 2019 after that defeat at Flushing Meadows and has played just twice this year, including astraight sets loss to Croat Donna Vekicin the Australian Open first round, her last competitive appearance.. Maria Sharapova is the third-youngest woman to win the Wimbledon singles title after Lottie Dod and Martina Hingis Sharapova shot to stardom in 2004 aged just 17 when victory over Serena Williams saw her become the third-youngest woman to win the Wimbledon singles title. She would go on to become one of the most high-profile names in women's sport, winning 36 singles titles and earning more than $38m (Â£29m) in prize money. In 2005 she became the first Russian woman to become world number one, and won her second Grand Slam singles title at the US Open the following year. But 2007 saw the first of Sharapova's struggles with injury, as she missed most of the clay court season with a shoulder problem. She would return to form and fitness to win the Australian Open at the start of 2008, but a second shoulder injury kept her off tour for the second half of the season, meaning she missed the US Open and Beijing Olympics. In 2012, Sharapova captured the French Open at Roland Garros to become the 10th woman to complete the career Grand Slam, before winning Olympic silver in London. Yet another shoulder injury saw her miss the second half of the 2013 season, although she returned the following year to win her second French Open, and fifth and final Grand Slam. This video can not be played Archive: 'I admitted my mistake - now I'm back' In March 2016, Sharapova told a news conference she had tested positive for meldonium at the Australian Open. Meldonium, a heart disease drug, became a banned substance on 1 January 2016. Sharapova said she had been taking the drug since 2006 for health problems and was unaware it had been added to the banned list, insisting she had ""not tried to use a performance-enhancing substance"". She was banned for two years, later reduced to 15 months following an appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. She returned to tennis in April 2017, winning what would be her final career singles title at the Tianjin Open in October that year. Sharapova reached the quarter-finals at the 2018 French Open and the last 16 of the Australian Open at the start of 2019, but injuries and loss of form began to take its toll. Following Sharapova's announcement, hercoachRiccardo Piattitweeted: ""It's been an honour to have worked with such an amazing athlete and person. I'll miss her on court and outside. I'm sorry we couldn't work together for longer. But I know our paths will cross again and I can't wait for it. In the meantime, good luck with everything."" Two-time Grand Slam championPetra Kvitovasaid it had been ""a pleasure"" to share a court with Sharapova. The Czech added: ""We always had great battles when we played and I have so much respect for your hard work and the way you always fight for everything. You have achieved a lot in your life and I know this is just the start."" Meanwhile, tennis legendBillie Jean Kingadded: ""From the day Maria Sharapova won her first Wimbledon title at age 17, she has been a great champion. A five-time major champion and a former world number one, her business success is just as impressive as her tennis achievements. Maria, the best is yet to come for you!"" Reacting after his victory over Philipp Kohlschreiber at the Dubai Open on Wednesday, world number one men's playerNovak Djokovicasked the crowd to offer a round of applause for Sharapova. ""She is a great fighter, as dedicated as someone can really be in our sport,"" the Serbian 17-time Grand Slam champion said. ""The will power and willingness to overcome the obstacle she had, with her injuries and surgeries and trying to fight to come back to the court and play at her desired level - it's truly inspirational to see what a mind of a champion she has. At the end of a fantastic career she can be proud of herself.""

Remember, you can find a record of everyword spoken in Parliament in Hansard,external, where the day's proceedings are written up. House of CommonsParliament Now Environment Secretary George Eustice is opening the debate on the second reading of the Environment Bill. This bill aims to improve air and water quality, tackle plastic pollution, restore wildlife, and protect the climate. You can read more about the bill from our environment analyst Roger Harrabin here. The SNP's Chris Stephen's has just proposed a ten minute rule bill - the Workers (Definition and Rights) Bill. He aims to establish a legal definition of employment, which will cover zero-hours contracts and agency workers, and help prevent abuses. ""It is now time to refine the definition of worker... and provide greater protection from day one of employment,"" he tells the Commons. Reality Check Boris Johnson said at PMQs: ""99% of all the solar panels installed in this country have happened under this Conservative government"". If you count ""this Conservative government"" as starting with the coalition with the Liberal Democrats in 2010 then he's right, according toBEIS statistics.,external If you measure from 2015, more than 60% of capacity had already been installed by then.

House of CommonsParliament DUP MP Ian Paisley welcomes the ""level-headed clarion certainty"" the health secretary has given people, but asks for more. He says many of his North Antrim constituents will be following the rugby game due to take place between Italy and Ireland this weekend. ""[Some say] the game should be stopped, but the Department of Health has taken a more level-headed approach,"" says Mr Paisley. ""However, the IRFU [Irish Rugby team] don't seem to know what to do. ""Can the minister give clear and clarion advice?"" Mr Hancock confirms he will ask the UK's chief medical officer to speak to their counterpart in the Republic of Ireland ""to make sure very best clinical advice is given, rather than me giving it from the despatch box."" House of CommonsParliament Tory MP Ben Everitt praises the response to coronavirus in his constituency of Milton Keynes North, which housed some of those who needed to be quarantined when returning from China. He also claims the UK has been ""the best prepared... in the world"" when dealing with the outbreak. Mr Hancock praises the town, before pointing approvingly to the press for its ""very responsible"" coverage of ""what is a very big story"". He adds: ""We have, of course, detailed operational plans for dealing with this, including if it gets much worse. ""But part of the plan is about the behaviour that people undertake, and how people respond in this House and in this country. ""So far, we have seen an exemplary response and I very much hope that continues."" House of CommonsParliament Mr Hancock says ""overreaction has its costs too"" - economically and socially. ""We have to react in a way that is proportional,"" he says. ""Our primary goal is to keep the public safe."" So for example, he says, schools should stay open, otherwise that would have an impact on children's education. House of CommonsParliament Mr Hancock is asked about flu vaccinations to ease pressures on services that may have to deal with coronavirus. The health secretary says the vaccination rate ""was at a record level this year"". He says people can also follow general advice including washing hands. Britons who were on a coronavirus-hit cruise ship were repatriated last week Tests for the virus arebeing expandedto include people
displaying flu-like symptoms at 11 hospitals and 100 GP surgeries across the
UK. Up to now, people were tested only if they displayed
symptoms having recently returned from one of the countries where there has
been an outbreak. The Foreign Office has also updated its travel advice,
warning against all but essential travel to 11 quarantined towns in Italy, and
advising to people to self-isolate on their return. However Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said there were no
plans to stop flights from Italy, which attracts about three million British
visitors each year. Four schools have shut completely for a week to carry out a
""deep clean"" after students and teachers returned from skiing trips
in northern Italy over half term. House of CommonsParliament In response to a question from former business secretary Greg Clark, Matt Hancock says the government is working with ""around a dozen private companies"" to bring in improved diagnostic equipment. He says it would be better if the virus could be diagnosed at a patient's bedside instead of swabs being sent to a laboratory, as is currently the case.

He says 13 people so far have been tested positive out of 7,132 - but more cases are to be expected. He adds that the government is ""taking all necessary measures"" to minimise the risk to the public. He says there is ""no need"" for schools to close or students to be sent home whilst test results are awaited. He says closing schools will not be necessary ""in most cases"" - and says new advice is coming shortly.

done"". House of CommonsParliament Chancellor Rishi Sunak is listening to Sajid Javid, from the front bench next to the prime minister Mr Javid says his successor Rishi Sunak is ""more than capable"" as chancellor. House of CommonsParliament Sajid Javid says ""checks and balances"" within government are important to ensure ""sensible decisions"" are made. Mr Javid resigned during a reshuffle after being asked to fire his ministerial aides. He says it has ""always been the case"" that ministers can appoint their own advisors, and he saw no reason why the Treasury ""should be the exception to that"". He says ""no particular person"" has a ""monopoly of the best ideas"". He says he felt the order to fire his aides would ""significantly inhibit"" the flow of good advice and would not have been in the national interest.

"'No excuses for not cutting crime', police toldThe home secretary signals the return of crime targets, saying ""outcomes"" in key areas will be measured.UK","Priti Patel told a crime conference she would be ""unapologetic"" about holding police to account There must be ""no excuses"" for not cutting crime, Home Secretary Priti Patel has told senior police officers. Speaking at a conference in central London, Ms Patel signalled the return of national targets, saying ""outcomes"" in key areas would be measured. The home secretary added she would be ""unapologetic"" about holding police to account. It came as ministers continued to dismiss allegations of bullying in the Home Office. 'More than 50,000 new police officers needed' Recruitment of 20,000 police to begin 'in weeks' Have police numbers dropped? Prime Minister Boris Johnson has pledged to recruit 20,000 new police officers in England and Wales within three years - almost reversing the reduction in numbers since the Conservatives came to power in 2010. Speaking at the the National Police Chiefs' Council and Association of Police and Crime Commissioners summit in Westminster, Ms Patel said she expected people to be able to see a difference when the new officers were in post, such as less crime and safer streets. She said success would be measured against a set of national policing outcomes, with priorities including reducing murders, serious violence and neighbourhood crime. Ms Patel said she was ""unequivocal"" in her support for officers, but added: ""We need to pull out all the stops to deliver the decline in crime that people want to see. There must be no weak spots. ""These outcomes will be non-negotiable and I will be unapologetic about holding you to account."" Priti Patel's message to the police was blunt: we're investing in you, now you must deliver. This will have come as little surprise to the chief constables gathered at the conference - a government which has made law and order a priority expects results. But the means by which ministers will gauge success - national ""outcomes"", or targets in all but name - are likely to cause concern. The last time national crime indicators were brought in, under Tony Blair's Labour administration, they had a series of unintended consequences, as certain serious offences, which were not being measured, weren't given the attention they should have been. The three-year deadline for reductions in crime set by the home secretary is also hugely ambitious. But the clear goal she has set is likely to be welcomed by the public, which, as she acknowledged in her speech, has lost confidence in the criminal justice system. Ms Patel's speech came as ministers continued todismiss allegations of bullying in the Home Officeafter claims she clashed with senior officials, belittled colleagues and is distrusted by intelligence chiefs. Ms Patel and permanent secretary Sir Philip Rutnam released a joint statement denying reports of a deep rift at the top of the department, while allies described her as a ""demanding"" boss but not a bully. Earlier, police minister Kit Malthouse insisted there was ""glutinous harmony"" in the department and he had not witnessed bullying by his boss. The reports of feuding prompted the head of the Civil Service, Sir Mark Sedwill, to order an end to media leaks in a missive to government staff. Ministers have continued to dismiss allegations Ms Patel bullied her staff Also in her speech, Ms Patel announced Â£41.5m of funding for forces in 18 areas worst affected by serious violence, and launched an eight-week consultation on plans to enshrine a police covenant in law. The plan, first mooted in the Conservative Party's general election manifesto, pledges to back the rights of serving or ex-police officers, staff and their families, recognise the responsibility and risks officers take, and introduce a code of ethics. The Police Federation of England and Wales welcomed the plans. National chairman John Apter said: ""Policing is a dangerous and unpredictable job and it's essential that there is something in place that ensures that police officers, staff, retired colleagues and their families receive the support they deserve. ""This consultation is an opportunity to help shape what a police covenant will look like. This is something I feel extremely passionate about and it's great to see this taking a step closer to becoming a reality.""

Sickest NHS patients 'face hours on trolleys',"This video can not be played Working in A&E for the NHS: 'Every day is relentless' Many of the most seriously ill patients are waiting for hours on trolleys and in corridors as the NHS struggles to find them beds, BBC research shows. Nearly a quarter of patients admitted on to wards during December and January in England faced delays of more than four hours before a bed could be found. It has created a backlog outside hospitals with patients brought in by ambulance facing long waits too. Experts warned there was ""little in the tank"" to cope with the coronavirus. There is mounting concern that the spread of the virus will lead to a pandemic with mass outbreaks in the UK. The BBC research - based on analysis of NHS England data - found the delays faced by some of the frailest and sickest patients have risen sharply this winter. The Royal College of Nursing said the situation was unacceptable and treating patients in this way was undignified and put them at risk. NHS England said extra money was being invested which would help hospitals recruit staff and cut waiting times. Kate Milsom was taken to hospital after a fall in January Kate Milsom is one of the many patients who has faced delays. She is 93 and was taken to London's Hillingdon Hospital in January after falling at home. The ambulance came quickly, but when she arrived at the hospital there was a long wait to be seen. She spent more than six hours on a trolley in a corridor - much of the time with the paramedics who had brought her in. ""I was in pain. I had broken my hip before so was really worried. ""The staff were nice... but they were just so busy."" She was eventually found a bed in a bay and was able to go home the following day. The trust said it could not comment on individual cases but acknowledged the busy nature of the hospital meant some patients faced long waits. It said staff were working hard to keep these to an ""absolute minimum"" and all patients were monitored to keep them safe. It is already widely documented thatA&E units have struggled this winter, missing the four-hour target by a record margin. The new BBC analysis looked at waits in England before and after A&E. It showed 199,000 patients had four-hour ""trolley waits"" after being seen in A&E before a bed could be found. That is more than two times higher than the numbers seen four years ago. In some hospitals half of patients had waited more than four hours. Another 130,000 patients brought in by ambulances were left waiting at least 30 minutes before they could be handed over to hospital staff - one in seven of all those brought in over the two-month period. Similar pressures are being seen in other parts of the UK, but because of the way figures are collected direct comparisons cannot be made. The RCN said the situation had got so bad that many hospitals had started deploying nurses to work in corridors, providing treatments such as oxygen and antibiotic drips to patients. RCN emergency care association chairman David Smith said: ""It is not what we want for our patients - it is not dignified and obviously safety is a concern. ""We do our best to make sure they are comfortable and react if they deteriorate. But it is really upsetting for nurses to have to see patients like this."" NHS England medical director Prof Stephen Powis praised the hard work of staff, saying they had ""pulled out all the stops"" amid rising demand. He said extra investment would lead to more staff and extra beds which would help in the future. The implications for a pandemic The coronavirus outbreak could not have come at a worse time. The winter has been the most challenging for a generation for the NHS. The World Health Organization has said governments across the world should prepare for a pandemic - defined as when the virus is being transmitted easily in many countries. There are signs it is spreading, with significant outbreaks reported in Italy, South Korea and Iran. There have only been 13 cases in the UK so far - and all were people who had been infected in Asia, meaning there has been no transmission within the UK. The patients have been treated in the five specialist respiratory centres, but there are plans to use 19 other regional units if needed, with NHS bosses saying there are robust contingency plans in place. Meanwhile, all hospitals have been asked to set up isolation pods in case patients with the virus go to hospital - the official advice is to phone NHS 111 and self-isolate. Don't go to A&E - some hospitals have installed special pods to keep potential coronavirus patients away from others England's chief medical officer Prof Chris Witty said the UK was still working to contain it - and if that did not work the hope was that the spread of the disease could be slowed so cases did not peak in winter. Britain's race to contain the coronavirus Coronavirus: What you need to know But Saffron Cordery, of NHS Providers, which represents hospitals, said with services at ""full stretch"" the additional effort needed to handle a mass outbreak of coronavirus needed extra funding if it was not to ""impinge"" on day-to-day services. Helen Buckingham, of the Nuffield Trust think tank, said the swine flu pandemic from 10 years ago showed the NHS was good at dealing with unexpected new illnesses. But she added it was clear there was ""very little fuel in the tank"" when it came to staff numbers and hospital beds.

Virgin Galactic sees demand for space travel surgeSir Richard Branson's firm says it is releasing more tickets for flights into space.BusinessComments,"Virgin Galactic has said it will release more tickets for flights into space amid surging demand. Sir Richard Branson's firm, which completed its first sub-orbital test flight in 2018, said it had received almost 8,000 registrations of interest for future commercial flights. That is more than double the amount it recorded at the end of September 2019. The firm has so far sold 600 tickets for its inaugural flights, scheduled for later this year. The news comes as Virgin Galactic's latest company results show a net loss of $73m (Â£55.6m) for the last quarter. Branson's Virgin Galactic set for market launch Virgin spaceship moves to operational base Wanted: New astronauts for Nasa Moon mission The billionaires fuelling a space race On Wednesday, the California-based company said it would begin taking $1,000 refundable deposits as it prepares to release the next batch of tickets to the general public. That will put them on a waiting list for when seats become available. However, Virgin Galactic said prices and timing for its next flight were not available yet. Tickets for its inaugural flights retailed at $250,000 apiece. Those to have already purchased tickets include celebrities Justin Bieber and Leonardo DiCaprio. Sir Richard Branson has said he will be on the first trip. ""We have been greatly encouraged by the ongoing and increasing demand seen from around the world for personal spaceflight,"" said Stephen Attenborough, Virgin Galactic's commercial director. Virgin Galactic saw its losses widen in the three months to December, compared with a $46m loss in the same period in 2018. Virgin Galactic is the only publicly-listed space tourism group, having floated on the New York stock exchange last October. The company, along with Elon Musk's SpaceX and Jeff Bezos's Blue Origin, have all been ina race to send tourists into space.

Sir Richard Branson's firm, which completed its first sub-orbital test flight in 2018, said it had received almost 8,000 registrations of interest for future commercial flights. That is more than double the amount it recorded at the end of September 2019. The firm has so far sold 600 tickets for its inaugural flights, scheduled for later this year. The news comes as Virgin Galactic's latest company results show a net loss of $73m (Â£55.6m) for the last quarter. Branson's Virgin Galactic set for market launch Virgin spaceship moves to operational base Wanted: New astronauts for Nasa Moon mission The billionaires fuelling a space race On Wednesday, the California-based company said it would begin taking $1,000 refundable deposits as it prepares to release the next batch of tickets to the general public. That will put them on a waiting list for when seats become available. However, Virgin Galactic said prices and timing for its next flight were not available yet. Tickets for its inaugural flights retailed at $250,000 apiece. Those to have already purchased tickets include celebrities Justin Bieber and Leonardo DiCaprio. Sir Richard Branson has said he will be on the first trip. ""We have been greatly encouraged by the ongoing and increasing demand seen from around the world for personal spaceflight,"" said Stephen Attenborough, Virgin Galactic's commercial director. Virgin Galactic saw its losses widen in the three months to December, compared with a $46m loss in the same period in 2018. Virgin Galactic is the only publicly-listed space tourism group, having floated on the New York stock exchange last October.

Woman fined for dropping Greggs paper bag in 2009Grace Firth was fined Â£40 after pleading guilty to a littering offence which happened in March 2009.Manchester,"Vegan sausage rolls weren't on the menu when Grace Firth dropped a Greggs bag in 2009 More than 10 years ago, Grace Firth tucked into a snack from Greggs. Somehow, the paper bag ended up on the ground rather than in the bin. Now the 32-year-old student from Stockport has found herself in court, accused of littering. Magistrates even questioned whether the date of the offence was a mistake because of how long ago it happened. It took so long to be resolved because Grace said she knew nothing about the original prosecution. She had been convicted in her absence in August 2009, fined Â£175 and ordered to pay Â£180 costs and a Â£15 victim surcharge. But Grace told Stockport Magistrates' Court the first she'd heard about the whole thing was when she got a letter on 8 December 2019 regarding an ""historical debt"". She said she had never received any letters before then, since they had been sent to her mum's house. ""Any mail for me was returned to sender or thrown away,"" she told the court.

Chancellor must raise taxes in first Budget - IFS,"The new chancellor must raise taxes in his first Budget or break the government's rules on borrowing, a leading economic think tank has warned. Rishi Sunak is under pressure to increase spending on the NHS, social care and schools. He has also inherited a fiscal target from his predecessor Sajid Javid to bring spending in to balance by 2022. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has suggested this will not be possible without increasing taxes. It said that loosening or abandoning the rules, set out in last year'sConservative election manifesto,external, would undermine the credibility of any fiscal targets the government set. However, the Conservative election manifesto said the government would not put up income tax, national insurance or VAT. Mr Sunak, who was appointed chancellor after Mr Javid's dramatic resignation in the cabinet reshuffle, will deliver the statement on 11 March. The Budget is the government's yearly announcement of its plans for tax and spending for the coming financial year, which starts in April. What was in the Conservative manifesto? Sajid Javid quits as chancellor Who is the new chancellor Rishi Sunak? The chancellor is understood to be facing pressure from Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his chief advisor Dominic Cummings to loosen spending constraints. The IFS said that even on current policy, borrowing next year could be Â£63bn, Â£23bn more than the most recent official forecast, putting Mr Javid's fiscal target in doubt. Taking into account the government's commitment to increasing investment spending, it added that even getting the current budget into balance would not be enough to bring down underlying debt over the course of the Parliament. Loosening or abandoning the current fiscal rule now would put debt on a clearly rising path, according to the IFS analysis. ""That would not be sustainable in the long-term,"" it said. The IFS has suggested alternative ways for raising revenue, including lifting the freeze on fuel duty to give the government Â£4bn more in revenue throughout Parliament. It also said abolishing entrepreneurs' relief in capital gains tax and increasing council tax for those living in more expensive properties could form part of a ""desirable package"" of reforms. Tory MPs have warned the chancellor against asking motorists to pay more in tax But such schemes could prove politically difficult. Some 18 Conservative MPs - including those from seats won last year for the first time since the war - have written to the chancellor warning him that raising fuel duty would ""clobber blue collar communities"". The Harlow MP Robert Halfon toldthe Conservative Home website,externalthat fuel duty was a ""totemic tax"" for many people and levels were already among the highest in Europe. ""If the Treasury really wants to flash multiple V-signs at the millions of blue-collar voters who lent us their vote, then putting up fuel duty would be a sure way of going about it,"" he wrote. IFS director Paul Johnson said Mr Sunak was ""hemmed in"" by a rising deficit and fiscal targets set out in the Conservative manifesto but he  should ""recognise that more spending must require more tax"". He added: ""They will allow him to increase investment spending, which will be welcome if well targeted. But they will not allow substantial increases in current spending, or tax cuts, to be funded by more borrowing. ""We have already had 16 fiscal targets in a decade, and fiscal targets should not just be for Christmas. ""Mr Sunak should resist the temptation to announce another and instead recognise that more spending must require more tax."" Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said 10 years of ""chaotic and erratic"" government under the Conservatives had seen 16 fiscal targets ""proposed and ripped up"". He added that the IFS report showed the ""damage done by a decade of decline"". ""Despite all the hype about this budget turning a page, it risks setting in train five years of disappointment.""

"PM launches review to 'overhaul' foreign policyPolicy experts will offer ""constructive challenge to traditional Whitehall assumptions"", says No 10.UK PoliticsComments","The UK has one of the largest defence budgets in the world The UK is to ""overhaul its approach to foreign policy"" as part of a government review, Downing Street has announced.

The diplomatic service, tackling organised crime, the use of technology and the procurement of military supplies will all be looked at. The review will also seek ""innovative ways"" to promote UK interests while committing to spending targets. The 2019 Conservative manifesto promised that the UK would continue to spend 0.7% of gross national income on international aid.

LiveLivePMQs: Boris Johnson faces MPs' questions8 minutes ago8 minutes ago PMQs coming upPMQs coming up54 minutes ago But first...But first...56 minutes ago Good morningGood morningLive PMQs: Boris Johnson faces MPs' questions  8 minutes ago,"Commons day starts with Wales questions PM Boris Johnson faces questions from Labour's Jeremy Corbyn Statement on coronavirus from Matt Hancock Environment Bill to be debated later Lords look at bill on NHS funding Paul Seddon and Emma Harrison Debate continues on the Environment Bill, with plenty of maiden speeches from new MPs. Remember, you can find a record of everyword spoken in Parliament in Hansard,external, where the day's proceedings are written up. House of CommonsParliament Now Environment Secretary George Eustice is opening the debate on the second reading of the Environment Bill. This bill aims to improve air and water quality, tackle plastic pollution, restore wildlife, and protect the climate. You can read more about the bill from our environment analyst Roger Harrabin here. The SNP's Chris Stephen's has just proposed a ten minute rule bill - the Workers (Definition and Rights) Bill. He aims to establish a legal definition of employment, which will cover zero-hours contracts and agency workers, and help prevent abuses. ""It is now time to refine the definition of worker... and provide greater protection from day one of employment,"" he tells the Commons. Reality Check Boris Johnson said at PMQs: ""99% of all the solar panels installed in this country have happened under this Conservative government"". If you count ""this Conservative government"" as starting with the coalition with the Liberal Democrats in 2010 then he's right, according toBEIS statistics.,external If you measure from 2015, more than 60% of capacity had already been installed by then. If you look at data,externalfrom the International Energy Agency, it turns out that about 96% of the world's solar generating capacity has been installed since 2010. House of CommonsParliament DUP MP Ian Paisley welcomes the ""level-headed clarion certainty"" the health secretary has given people, but asks for more. He says many of his North Antrim constituents will be following the rugby game due to take place between Italy and Ireland this weekend. ""[Some say] the game should be stopped, but the Department of Health has taken a more level-headed approach,"" says Mr Paisley. ""However, the IRFU [Irish Rugby team] don't seem to know what to do. ""Can the minister give clear and clarion advice?"" Mr Hancock confirms he will ask the UK's chief medical officer to speak to their counterpart in the Republic of Ireland ""to make sure very best clinical advice is given, rather than me giving it from the despatch box."" House of CommonsParliament Tory MP Ben Everitt praises the response to coronavirus in his constituency of Milton Keynes North, which housed some of those who needed to be quarantined when returning from China. He also claims the UK has been ""the best prepared... in the world"" when dealing with the outbreak. Mr Hancock praises the town, before pointing approvingly to the press for its ""very responsible"" coverage of ""what is a very big story"". He adds: ""We have, of course, detailed operational plans for dealing with this, including if it gets much worse. ""But part of the plan is about the behaviour that people undertake, and how people respond in this House and in this country. ""So far, we have seen an exemplary response and I very much hope that continues."" House of CommonsParliament Mr Hancock says ""overreaction has its costs too"" - economically and socially. ""We have to react in a way that is proportional,"" he says. ""Our primary goal is to keep the public safe."" So for example, he says, schools should stay open, otherwise that would have an impact on children's education. House of CommonsParliament Mr Hancock is asked about flu vaccinations to ease pressures on services that may have to deal with coronavirus. The health secretary says the vaccination rate ""was at a record level this year"". He says people can also follow general advice including washing hands. Britons who were on a coronavirus-hit cruise ship were repatriated last week Tests for the virus arebeing expandedto include people
displaying flu-like symptoms at 11 hospitals and 100 GP surgeries across the
UK. Up to now, people were tested only if they displayed
symptoms having recently returned from one of the countries where there has
been an outbreak. The Foreign Office has also updated its travel advice,
warning against all but essential travel to 11 quarantined towns in Italy, and
advising to people to self-isolate on their return. However Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said there were no
plans to stop flights from Italy, which attracts about three million British
visitors each year. Four schools have shut completely for a week to carry out a
""deep clean"" after students and teachers returned from skiing trips
in northern Italy over half term. House of CommonsParliament In response to a question from former business secretary Greg Clark, Matt Hancock says the government is working with ""around a dozen private companies"" to bring in improved diagnostic equipment. He says it would be better if the virus could be diagnosed at a patient's bedside instead of swabs being sent to a laboratory, as is currently the case. The shadow chancellor says Sajid Javid's speech contained a ""damning attack"" on the PM's senior advisor Dominic Cummings - and points to his remarks about future decisions... Allow Twitter content?

He says it is not yet certain it will become a pandemic, so the plan is still to contain it. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

House of CommonsParliament Mr Hancock reitrates advice the government has already issued that those returning from areas affected by coronavirus such as certain areas in Italy, should self-isolate if they have symptoms. He says the government's approach has been guided by the chief medical officer. He says the public can be assured they have a clear plan to âcontain delay and
search and mitigateâ the spread of the virus. Here's more on what you need to know House of CommonsParliament Health Secretary Matt Hancock updates MPs on the government's response to the spread of the coronovirus. He says 13 people so far have been tested positive out of 7,132 - but more cases are to be expected. He adds that the government is ""taking all necessary measures"" to minimise the risk to the public. He says there is ""no need"" for schools to close or students to be sent home whilst test results are awaited. He says closing schools will not be necessary ""in most cases"" - and says new advice is coming shortly. House of CommonsParliament In reply, Boris Johnson says he would like to thank Mr Javid for his ""immense service to this country"". He says the former chancellor has ""friends and admirers on all sides of this House"". House of CommonsParliament Mr Javid finishes by paying tribute to Boris Johnson. ""I firmly believe that
the PM has the tenacity, the energy and the skill to see it [their shared vision] thorough."" He says the PM ""has my full confidence"" and ""full support to get it
done"". House of CommonsParliament Chancellor Rishi Sunak is listening to Sajid Javid, from the front bench next to the prime minister Mr Javid says his successor Rishi Sunak is ""more than capable"" as chancellor. House of CommonsParliament Sajid Javid says ""checks and balances"" within government are important to ensure ""sensible decisions"" are made. Mr Javid resigned during a reshuffle after being asked to fire his ministerial aides. He says it has ""always been the case"" that ministers can appoint their own advisors, and he saw no reason why the Treasury ""should be the exception to that"". He says ""no particular person"" has a ""monopoly of the best ideas"". He says he felt the order to fire his aides would ""significantly inhibit"" the flow of good advice and would not have been in the national interest. And he makes a pun on the name of advisor Dominic Cummings, as Huffington Post's Paul Waugh points out: Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Delhi sees third day of deadly religious riots,"This video can not be played Delhi religious riots: 'Mobs set fire to my house and shop' Delhi remains on edge after three nights of rioting, with reports of Muslim homes and shops being targeted by violent mobs. Twenty-seven people have been killed so far in the deadliest violence the Indian capital has seen in decades. The clashes first broke out on Sunday between protesters for and against a controversial citizenship law. But they have since taken on communal overtones, with reports of many Muslims being attacked. Photographs, videos and accounts on social media paint a chilling image of the last few days - of mostly Hindu mobs beating unarmed men, including journalists; of groups of men with sticks, iron rods and stones wandering the streets; and of Hindus and Muslims facing off. Access to these areas was severely restricted on Tuesday, when most of the violence took place. Judging by the names released so far, both Muslims and Hindus are among the dead and injured. The Delhi High Court, which is hearing petitions about the violence, has said it cannot let ""another 1984"" happen on its ""watch"". In 1984, more than 3,000 Sikhs were killed in anti-Sikh riots in the city. Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted on Wednesday, three days after the violence broke out, appealing for peace. He added that he had reviewed the situation and police were working to restore normality. Mosques have been vandalised in the clashes Opposition leader Sonia Gandhi has called for the resignation of Home Minister Amit Shah, saying he is ""responsible"" for the violence. Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has described the situation as ""alarming"" and demanded for the army to be called in. Why Delhi violence has echoes of Gujarat riots Inside Delhi's night of horror India's new 'anti-Muslim' law explained India state begins enacting controversial citizenship law The unrest is centred around Muslim-majority neighbourhoods - such as Maujpur, Mustafabad, Jaffrabad and Shiv Vihar - in north-east Delhi. The streets in these areas are littered with stones and shattered glass. Broken and burnt vehicles are strewn about, and the stench of smoke from smouldering buildings fills the air. While fresh clashes have not been reported on Wednesday, the city continues to simmer. BBC reporters saw Muslim residents in Mustafabad leaving their homes with bags and bundles of their belongings, fearing further violence. Allow Twitter content?

Some 189 people are injured, according to officials at the Guru Teg Bahadur hospital, where many of them have been admitted. BBC reporters at the hospital say they saw people with all sorts of injuries, including bullet wounds, scrambling for treatment. They say the hospital seemed ""overwhelmed"", and many of the injured were ""too scared to go back home"". Many, including journalists, have tweeted and spoken of mobs demanding to know their religion. At least one photojournalist said he was asked to remove his pants to prove his religious identity. This has also happened during religious riots in the past to identify Muslims as they are usually circumcised. Faisal Mohammed, BBC Hindi, Ashok Nagar A small crowd of around a dozen people is standing outside a vandalised mosque in Ashok Nagar, one of the areas worst affected by the violence. The front of the green and white building is scorched. An Indian flag and a saffron flag, commonly associated with right-wing Hindu groups, are flying from one of the minarets. Torn pages from the Koran are strewn outside the building. Two young men are picking up the pages and putting them in a plastic bag. One man says he will take the pages and bury them in a graveyard. As I enter the building, I see skull caps and partially burned prayer mats. The area where the mosque stands is a Hindu neighbourhood, but residents say that they had nothing to do with its desecration. They blame ""outsiders"", saying that they did not intervene as they were afraid of being targeted. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

It appears to have started with a threat issued by Kapil Mishra, a leader from the governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), against protesters opposing the citizenship law. On Sunday, he led a rally in Jaffrabad and asked people - via Twitter - to gather in the area. In his tweet, he told the Delhi police they had three days to clear the protest sites and warned of consequences if they failed to do so. The first reports of clashes emerged later that day. The police and protesters fought pitched battles on the streets of Delhi The Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), which grants amnesty to illegal non-Muslim immigrants from certain Muslim-majority countries, has sharply polarised India. Critics say it discriminates against Muslims, while the government denies this, saying it only offers citizenship to persecuted minorities. But it has sparked huge protests, including those led by Muslim women. Some of these - such as the one in Delhi's Shaheen Bagh - have become the target of right-wing vitriol. At least three BJP leaders, including Mr Mishra, have been accused of inciting violence through hate speeches. The Delhi High Court is currently hearing petitions to register a police complaint against them. There is heavy police presence in the affected areas, and paramilitary troops have also been deployed in an effort to keep peace. ""There are enough forces on the ground and no one needs to fear,"" National Security Adviser Ajit Doval told NDTV news channel, and asked the people of Delhi to trust ""the man in uniform"". Mr Doval was responding to accusations that police were not doing enough to help those under attack. The affected areas are close to the Loni border - that Delhi shares with Uttar Pradesh state - which has now been sealed. Schools in the area have been closed, and year-end exams postponed. Vehicles were set alight during clashes in the capital The Delhi police have also been accused of being under-prepared and outnumbered. More than 50 policemen have also been injured and at least one - a constable named Ratan Lal - was killed. Police spokesman MS Randhawa told reporters on Tuesday that the situation was under control and a ""sufficient number of policemen"" had been deployed. Paramilitary forces have been deployed as well. The central cabinet is expected to meet later on Wednesday to review the situation. Home Minister Amit Shah, who is in charge of the city's police force, led a meeting with officials and policemen on Tuesday night. The timing of the unrest is being seen as an embarrassment for Prime Minister Narendra Modi as he was hosting US President Donald Trump over the last two days on his first official visit to India. As the violence escalated, it overshadowed Mr Trump's visit, making it to national and global headlines. Inside Delhi's night of horror.

Drinks giant warns coronavirus will hit profits,"Drinks giant Diageo has warned its profits will fall this year, as bars and restaurants in China are forced to close due to the coronavirus outbreak. The Guinness-owner said operating profits could be Â£140m-Â£200m lower than expected due to disruption across Asia. It joins companies such asAppleand Danone in warning about the impact of the deadly virus. Financial markets have also fallen sharply this week as fears of a pandemic grow. The company - whose brands include Smirnoff, Johnnie Walker, Tanqueray and Gordon's gin - also warned on Wednesday that sales could be Â£225m-Â£325m lower than expected, depending on how long it took for the outbreak to end. 'We cancelled our holiday because of coronavirus' It said,externalthat bars and restaurants in China ""have largely been closed and there has been a substantial reduction in banqueting... We have seen significant disruption since the end of January which we expect to last at least into March. ""Thereafter, we expect a gradual improvement with consumption returning to normal levels towards the end of fiscal 2020."" Events being postponed in several other Asian countries, especially South Korea, Japan and Thailand, as well as a reduction in conferences and banquets and a drop in tourism have all had an impact on people buying its products. It added that the coronavirus outbreak had caused a ""significant reduction"" in people using airports, especially in Asia, hitting travel retail. China is a very important market for Diageo. In the six months to 31 December, net sales in Greater China, which includes Taiwan, increased 24%. There was double-digit growth in both Chinese white spirits and Scotch. Investors are clearly nervous about the effects of the coronavirus - UK and US markets have in the last two days lost all the gains they have made so far this year - but have struggled to quantify exactly how big the problem will be, and how different sectors will be affected. In the absence of information, they have sold the obvious shares - airlines, holiday operators and luxury goods companies. Diageo's market update, which says its annual profit could be hit by Â£200m, will give them pause for thought about the wider implications. The drinks company spells out what should be obvious - bars and restaurants across China, one of its biggest markets, have been closed. Big events, another money-spinner for Diageo, have been cancelled across Asia. It is a sobering - no pun intended - assessment of how corporate earnings will be affected. Last year's giant stock market gains were a reflection of investors' assumptions that profits would stay high. That assumption now looks in grave doubt. Most infections are in China, the original source of coronavirus, wheremore than 77,000 people have the diseaseand over 2,600 have died. More than 1,200 cases have been confirmed in about 30 other countries and there have been more than 20 deaths. Italy reported four more deaths on Monday, raising the total there to seven. There are 53 confirmed cases in the US, and officials are calling on Congress to approve billions of dollars to fund the response effort.

Global shares fall for fifth day on virus fears,"Trading in global financial markets paused for breath on Wednesday, after days of sharp losses spurred by fears about the coronavirus. The main US indexes were mixed, rising from Tuesday's losses in early trade, before retreating later in the day. The Dow ended down almost 0.5%, while the S&P 500 dropped about 0.4% and the Nasdaq gained about 0.2%. In Europe, London'sFTSE 100 indexand other major bourses pared their losses and were mostly flat. Earlier, Japan's Nikkei 225 index and the Hang Seng in Hong Kong closed 0.8% and 0.7% lower respectively. The mixed performance come amid ongoing warnings from firms that supply chains are being disrupted by measures to contain the new virus, which has spread to more than 30 countries. Factory production continues to lag, travel restrictions remain in place and consumers in some countries are staying at home. Drinks giant warns coronavirus will hit profits London firms send staff home amid coronavirus fear Europe's coronavirus outbreak spreads from Italy The virus is likely to reduce global growth in the first three months of this year by almost 1%, Moody's Analytics estimates. However, it warned that if the outbreak was not contained as expected, it could trigger recessions in the US and elsewhere. ""The coronavirus has been a body blow to the Chinese economy, which now threatens to take out the entire global economy,"" chief economist Mark Zandi said. Share markets have faced days of turmoil, with the FTSE 100 hitting a 12-month low on Tuesday and the main US indexes losing more than 3% overnight. On Wednesday, drinks giant Diageo, which owns Guinness and Johnnie Walker whisky, said the coronavirus could cost it Â£200m in lost earnings this year. Its shares fell 1.8% in London. Miner Rio Tinto also lost 1.8% after it warned the disease could hit its operations in the next six months. Microsoft also warned it would not hit its sales targets for the quarter, despite strong demand, because its ""supply chain is returning to normal operations at a slower pace than anticipated"". ""I think we should anticipate that this environment of heightened volatility and concern continues,"" Rebecca McVittie, investment director at Fidelity International, told the BBC's Today programme. She said that countries that supplied parts for complex products - such as cars and computers - were increasingly being affected by the outbreak. ""We've now seen more cases of coronavirus in South Korea. That's a country that plays a very important role, for example, in tech supply chains,"" she said. ""I think we should anticipate that markets will probably move down."" The moves came as the outbreak continued to spread outside China, with Iran, South Korea and Italy reporting a surge in cases. About 77,000 people in China, where the virus emerged last year, have been infected and nearly 2,600 have died. Outside China, more than 1,200 cases have been confirmed in about 30 countries and there have been more than 20 deaths. The International Chamber of Shipping estimates that the industry is losing around $350m a week because of the coronavirus, with empty containers waiting in ports in China and shortages in the US. However, work in China is slowly starting to resume in many provinces. Guy Platten, secretary general of the organisation, said he is hopeful that trade will start to rebalance. ""There's a big backlog which will have to be addressed in the coming months, but at least now we hear that the factories are starting to get back to work again,"" he said.

Five times more sleep rough than official figures,"This video can not be played 'Homelessness could happen to anybody' More than 28,000 people in the UK were recorded sleeping rough in 12 months, research by the BBC has suggested. In England five times as many rough sleepers were seen by councils in the year than reported in official figures, which are a one-night snapshot. Labour's shadow housing secretary John Healey has called for an investigation into the government's published statistics, calling them ""misleading"". The government said it was providing Â£437m this year to tackle homelessness. It said it believed the official snapshot was a ""good estimate"" of rough sleeping ""on a given night."" New official figures will be released on Thursday but the datafor 2018 showed 4,677people slept rough in England on the one night the snapshot survey was taken, down 2% on the year before but 165% up on 2010. However council responses to the BBC showed nearly 25,000 people were recorded sleeping rough at least once in England during the latest year on record. The BBC asked councils for the number of individuals amid concerns raised last year that the official one-night snapshot did not give the full picture. Mr Healey said he had written to the UK Statistics Authority to ask them to investigate the accuracy of the government's statistics. He said: ""These figures expose the shameful scale of rough sleeping on our country's streets. ""They also confirm that the government's own published statistics are seriously misleading and an unreliable undercount of the number of people sleeping rough."" Nancy Webb has been in and out of hostels for 10 years In Oxford there were 430 rough sleepers recorded during 2019, compared with 43 during the single night count. This meant the city had one of the highest rates of rough sleeping per household population outside London. For the past 10 years Nancy Webb has been in and out of hostels. ""It's dehumanising,"" the 33-year-old said. ""It chips away at you and, once you become homeless, you start to feel trapped and you're going round in circles."" Miss Webb said she had been attacked by other homeless people. ""I have been spat on and had drinks thrown over me and it is terrifying,"" she said. ""I always try and go somewhere hidden if I am sleeping out, but even then it's scary because you don't want to be isolated because that's terrifying and you don't want to be somewhere where people are going to be walking past you, because that's terrifying too."" Stephen Dare was homeless for nine years Stephen Dare has recently been housed in a flat but said he spent most of the past decade homeless. ""I was soaking wet in my sleeping bag for nine years,"" he said. He wants to see quicker access to council housing for homeless people. There are currently 2,645 households on the waiting list for council homes in Oxford, 1,023 of whom are existing tenants. Jane Cranston, chairwoman of the Oxford Homeless Movement, said: ""One of the things that shocked me is a lot of these guys coming in have got jobs, so they are homeless because properties are too expensive,"" she said. Councillor Linda Smith, deputy leader of Oxford City Council, said the number sleeping out on a single night had fallen 30% since 2017. ""There are obviously still too many people sleeping rough in Oxford, but the reduction shows the hard work that we and our partners have put in over the years,"" she said. The council is increasing spending on tackling homelessness from Â£6m a year to Â£7.4m covering beds, showers and meals as well as support for people negotiating with landlords and finding work. It also plans to build 600 new council houses. The government publishes figures for rough sleeping based on the numbers of people seen or estimated to be sleeping rough in each local authority in England on one night in autumn. The BBC asked councils how many individuals they recorded sleeping rough at any stage in 2019 - whether they slept rough once or multiple times - and three quarters replied with figures. Some councils, including Wigan and Doncaster, were unable to provide figures for the number of individuals over the year. Even among those who did it was not possible to say how many of those recorded may have also slept rough in another area. This means some people may have been counted more than once. In Wales the total was 599 rough sleepers but most councils referred to Welsh government statistics rather than providing full-year figures. In Scotlandthe 2,800 recorded came mainly from housing applications in which people said they slept rough during the previous three months. The Northern Ireland Housing Executive only provided an estimate based on a single night snapshot, when it found 38. In London councils referred to CHAIN, a database managed by the charity St Mungo's with the latest full year figures covering 2018-19. In 2019 theOffice for Statistics Regulation,external(OSR) said it expected the government to ""plan for better statistics on rough sleeping"". A spokeswoman said the OSR ""hopes to see the inclusion of improved guidance which clearly sets out the limitations of the current annual snapshot approach in England"". Train lines shut amid rising river levels Schools close as pupils return from Coronavirus-hit Italy The council house may be seeing a revival Central London has consistently had the highest number of rough sleepers. Outside the capital, Hastings recorded the highest rates of individuals per household population out of the councils that replied. Hastings Council said it had halved the number of people sleeping rough on one night since 2018, down from 48 to 24. It said it had used government funding alongside its own money for initiatives including a team of health, mental health, substance dependency, social care and housing specialists providing support for rough sleepers. Nottingham City Council said it knew of 795 individuals who slept rough between April and December 2019, compared with 30 on a typical single night. Councillor Linda Woodings said the number of homeless people had ""undoubtedly risen significantly"" following funding cuts and welfare reforms, but rough sleeping in Nottingham was falling. ""Challenges remain around people unwilling to engage with us to access support available to them, increasing numbers of people arriving from elsewhere and with insufficient affordable housing,"" Councillor Woodings said. ""Also, while we are very successful at bidding for Government grants, it is still not enough to properly address the issue as it continues to grow."" In Greater Manchester the number ofrough sleepers fell by a third in 2019but the region's mayor, Andy Burnham, said despite ""real progress"" there were still too many people on the streets.

""Tonight in Westminster, up to 300 people will be bedding down in doorways and on the streets.

Jon Sparkes, chief executive of Crisis, said: ""Rough sleeping is the most brutal form of homelessness but we still do not have a clear picture of how many people are forced to sleep on our streets throughout the year.

Housing spokesman Councillor David Renard said local authorities needed the power to start a ""renaissance in council house-building"", adding: ""Money allocated to councils is increasingly being spent on providing temporary accommodation, meaning there is less for other homelessness services."" A Government spokesman said: ""We're committed to eliminating rough sleeping by the end of the Parliament and our efforts have already led to the first nationwide fall in a decade."" ""We're confident our independently verified snapshot provides a good estimate of the numbers of people sleeping rough on a given night.

"Five times more sleep rough than official figures28,000 individual rough sleepers were recorded by councils across the UK in a single year.England","This video can not be played 'Homelessness could happen to anybody' More than 28,000 people in the UK were recorded sleeping rough in 12 months, research by the BBC has suggested. In England five times as many rough sleepers were seen by councils in the year than reported in official figures, which are a one-night snapshot. Labour's shadow housing secretary John Healey has called for an investigation into the government's published statistics, calling them ""misleading"". The government said it was providing Â£437m this year to tackle homelessness. It said it believed the official snapshot was a ""good estimate"" of rough sleeping ""on a given night."" New official figures will be released on Thursday but the datafor 2018 showed 4,677people slept rough in England on the one night the snapshot survey was taken, down 2% on the year before but 165% up on 2010. However council responses to the BBC showed nearly 25,000 people were recorded sleeping rough at least once in England during the latest year on record. The BBC asked councils for the number of individuals amid concerns raised last year that the official one-night snapshot did not give the full picture. Mr Healey said he had written to the UK Statistics Authority to ask them to investigate the accuracy of the government's statistics. He said: ""These figures expose the shameful scale of rough sleeping on our country's streets. ""They also confirm that the government's own published statistics are seriously misleading and an unreliable undercount of the number of people sleeping rough."" Nancy Webb has been in and out of hostels for 10 years In Oxford there were 430 rough sleepers recorded during 2019, compared with 43 during the single night count. This meant the city had one of the highest rates of rough sleeping per household population outside London. For the past 10 years Nancy Webb has been in and out of hostels. ""It's dehumanising,"" the 33-year-old said. ""It chips away at you and, once you become homeless, you start to feel trapped and you're going round in circles."" Miss Webb said she had been attacked by other homeless people. ""I have been spat on and had drinks thrown over me and it is terrifying,"" she said. ""I always try and go somewhere hidden if I am sleeping out, but even then it's scary because you don't want to be isolated because that's terrifying and you don't want to be somewhere where people are going to be walking past you, because that's terrifying too."" Stephen Dare was homeless for nine years Stephen Dare has recently been housed in a flat but said he spent most of the past decade homeless. ""I was soaking wet in my sleeping bag for nine years,"" he said. He wants to see quicker access to council housing for homeless people. There are currently 2,645 households on the waiting list for council homes in Oxford, 1,023 of whom are existing tenants. Jane Cranston, chairwoman of the Oxford Homeless Movement, said: ""One of the things that shocked me is a lot of these guys coming in have got jobs, so they are homeless because properties are too expensive,"" she said. Councillor Linda Smith, deputy leader of Oxford City Council, said the number sleeping out on a single night had fallen 30% since 2017. ""There are obviously still too many people sleeping rough in Oxford, but the reduction shows the hard work that we and our partners have put in over the years,"" she said. The council is increasing spending on tackling homelessness from Â£6m a year to Â£7.4m covering beds, showers and meals as well as support for people negotiating with landlords and finding work. It also plans to build 600 new council houses. The government publishes figures for rough sleeping based on the numbers of people seen or estimated to be sleeping rough in each local authority in England on one night in autumn. The BBC asked councils how many individuals they recorded sleeping rough at any stage in 2019 - whether they slept rough once or multiple times - and three quarters replied with figures. Some councils, including Wigan and Doncaster, were unable to provide figures for the number of individuals over the year. Even among those who did it was not possible to say how many of those recorded may have also slept rough in another area. This means some people may have been counted more than once. In Wales the total was 599 rough sleepers but most councils referred to Welsh government statistics rather than providing full-year figures. In Scotlandthe 2,800 recorded came mainly from housing applications in which people said they slept rough during the previous three months. The Northern Ireland Housing Executive only provided an estimate based on a single night snapshot, when it found 38. In London councils referred to CHAIN, a database managed by the charity St Mungo's with the latest full year figures covering 2018-19. In 2019 theOffice for Statistics Regulation,external(OSR) said it expected the government to ""plan for better statistics on rough sleeping"". A spokeswoman said the OSR ""hopes to see the inclusion of improved guidance which clearly sets out the limitations of the current annual snapshot approach in England"". Train lines shut amid rising river levels Schools close as pupils return from Coronavirus-hit Italy The council house may be seeing a revival Central London has consistently had the highest number of rough sleepers. Outside the capital, Hastings recorded the highest rates of individuals per household population out of the councils that replied. Hastings Council said it had halved the number of people sleeping rough on one night since 2018, down from 48 to 24. It said it had used government funding alongside its own money for initiatives including a team of health, mental health, substance dependency, social care and housing specialists providing support for rough sleepers. Nottingham City Council said it knew of 795 individuals who slept rough between April and December 2019, compared with 30 on a typical single night. Councillor Linda Woodings said the number of homeless people had ""undoubtedly risen significantly"" following funding cuts and welfare reforms, but rough sleeping in Nottingham was falling. ""Challenges remain around people unwilling to engage with us to access support available to them, increasing numbers of people arriving from elsewhere and with insufficient affordable housing,"" Councillor Woodings said. ""Also, while we are very successful at bidding for Government grants, it is still not enough to properly address the issue as it continues to grow."" In Greater Manchester the number ofrough sleepers fell by a third in 2019but the region's mayor, Andy Burnham, said despite ""real progress"" there were still too many people on the streets.

US warns of 'inevitable' virus spread amid more cases,"A Kobe Bryant fan wears a mask to his memorial service in LA on Monday Health officials in the US have warned Americans to brace for the ""inevitable"" spread of the coronavirus disease that is sweeping the world. There are 53 confirmed cases in the US, and officials are calling on Congress to urgently pass billions of dollars to fund the response effort. On Wednesday in South Korea, the first case of coronavirus in the US military was confirmed at a military base. The 23-year-old soldier is now under self-quarantine,US Forces Korea said.,external President Trump had claimed that the spread of coronavirus was ""well under control"". More than 2,700 people have died and some 80,000 have been taken ill, mostly in China where the virus originated. Outside China, Iran, South Korea and Italy have reported the largest number of cases causing concern that the virus could be becoming a pandemic. The first positive virus test has been recorded in Latin America - a 61-year-old Brazilian resident who had just returned from Italy.  Local media reported that the man would be tested again for final confirmation. On Tuesday, US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and Prevention experts warned Americans of the coming outbreak. ""We are asking the American public to prepare for the expectation that this might be bad,"" said Dr Nancy Messonnier of the National Center for Immunisation and Respiratory Diseases in a conference call with reporters on Tuesday. ""It's not so much a question of if this will happen in this country any more but a question of when this will happen,"" she said, adding: ""Disruption to everyday life might be severe."" What is coronavirus and what are the symptoms? Analysis: How close are we to a pandemic? The warning marks a change of tone for the CDC, which, until now, has largely been focused on efforts to stop the contagion from entering the country and on quarantining people who have travelled from China. This video can not be played Epidemic v pandemic: What's the difference? So far, 14 patients have been diagnosed with Covid-19 inside the US, while another 39 people have been diagnosed outside the US but are being treated in the country. A pharmacy in California warns of shortages in gloves and masks CDC health officials have outlined measures that schools and business may need to take, including limiting the size of classrooms, and employing ""internet-based tele-schooling"". ""For adults, businesses can replace in-person meetings with video or telephone conferences and increase tele-working options,"" said Dr Messonnier. Hospitals also may need to postpone elective surgeries, she warned, and increase video conferencing capabilities for treating patients remotely. A vaccine will not be ready for more than a year, they say. Meanwhile US Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Alex Azar has asked a Senate subcommittee to approve $2.5 bn (Â£1.9 bn) in funding to fight the outbreak. ""We cannot hermetically seal off the United States to a virus,"" he told lawmakers. ""And we need to be realistic about that."" The money, he said, would pay for the US to expand its surveillance systems for the virus, would support local and state governments, and would help scientists develop vaccines. Fears of a pandemic sent the Dow Jones and S&P 500 stock indices tumbling. The US indices saw their biggest four day percentage drop since December 2018. Mr Azar also said the US needed to expand its stockpiles of protective equipment, like surgical masks. He said that right now the US has a stockpile of about 30 million masks, but it actually needs 300 million to supply to healthcare workers. Earlier in the day President Donald Trump told reporters during a news conference in India that the disease is ""very well under control in our country"". ""I think the whole situation will start working out,"" he added. What you need to know A visual guide to the outbreak Tell us how you've been affected by emailinghaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external.

High-stakes debate has Sanders in the crosshairs,"This video can not be played Attacks on Sanders and Bloomberg define the debate in South Carolina The Democratic presidential candidate debate in Charleston, South Carolina, reprised a piece of political theatre similar to a performance six days earlier in Las Vegas. On stage in Nevada last week, the debate played out like a dinner-theatre murder mystery. Michael Bloomberg was the victim, while everyone else on the stage had a motive and the means to do him in. This time, on Tuesday night, it was Bernie Sanders who got the rhetorical bludgeoning. It was the last debate before South Carolina votes on Saturday - followed by 14 other states next Tuesday - and was full of tense moments and sharp exchanges, reflecting the high stakes. Right at the top, former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg referenced a recent report that Russia was attempting to boost Sanders's presidential campaign. ""Vladimir Putin thinks that Donald Trump should be president of the United States,"" he said. ""And that's why Russia is helping you get elected, so you will lose to him."" For two hours, Sanders faced slings and arrows from his opponents Elizabeth Warren, who hasn't often taken swipes at Sanders, said they both wanted universal healthcare, but she ""dug in"" and ""did the work"" to pay for her plan, and ""Bernie's team trashed me for it"". After facing pressure from his opponents, Sanders backed away from his 2005 vote to protect gun manufacturers from legal liability for deaths from their products - a rare admission of error from the Vermont senator. ""I have cast thousands of votes, including bad votes,"" he said. ""That was a bad vote."" US election 2020 : All you need to know about the presidential race Meet the Democrats vying to take on Trump He stood behind his recent praise of communist Cuba's literacy programmes (while still condemning the nation's human rights abuses.) ""Really? Literacy programs are bad?"" Sanders exclaimed. ""Occasionally it might be a good idea to be honest about American foreign policy. America has overthrown governments all over the world."" For two hours, Sanders faced slings and arrows from his opponents. He responded in typical Sanders fashion, with tried and true lines his supporters can probably recite from heart at this point. It has worked for him so far. It wasn't the fight most people were anticipating, but it was one they probably should have expected. Biden has his back to the wall in South Carolina, where he needs a win if he wants to keep his hopes of winning the nomination alive. Joe Biden showed a fire and a sense of urgency he's lacked in previous engagements While Tom Steyer hasn't been much of a factor nationally, the self-funded billionaire candidate has spent heavily in South Carolina - and eaten into the former vice-president's support there. On Tuesday night, Biden tried to take him down a peg, by criticising Steyer's investment in a company that ran private prisons cited for human-rights abuses. When Steyer replied that he had sold his stock and had helped fund a bank to support black-owned businesses, Biden was ready with his rejoinder. ""Where we come from, that's called Tommy come lately,"" he quipped. It may not have been the knockout blow Biden needed, but throughout the debate he showed a fire and a sense of urgency he's lacked in previous engagements. Now, he has to hope that it's enough to give him a second lease of electoral life. The Bloomberg campaign promised that Tuesday night's debate would go much better than last week's. They were right, although it had less to do with the candidate's performance than his opponents deciding they had bigger fish (Sanders) to fry. Michael Bloomberg (left) and Elizabeth Warren (centre) again traded accusations That didn't stop the former mayor from almost torpedoing his candidacy again, by verbally stumbling and nearly saying that he ""bought"" - instead of ""got"" - all the winning candidates who enabled the Democratic takeover of the House of Representatives in the 2018 mid-term elections. And then there was Elizabeth Warren, Bloomberg's nemesis last week, who made yet another run at the billionaire and his past funding of Republican candidates. ""I don't care how much money Mayor Bloomberg has,"" she said. ""The core of the Democratic Party will never trust him. He has not earned their trust."" Bloomberg had a few bright moments, boasting of his economic and social policy record in New York City and highlighting his support for gun control. It's clear at this point, however, that his strongest campaign asset will be his limitless resources, not rhetorical flourishes in the debate hall. It was a chaotic, sprawling debate, with candidates often talking over each other and the moderators. Many times their answers went on beyond the allotted time. ""I know it goes fast, but a minute 15 is really a long time,"" Gale King, one of the hosts, admonished Pete Buttigieg. At one point, Joe Biden expressed exasperation, sardonically saying, ""I know how you cut me off every time, but I'm not going to be quiet anymore."" Then he stopped talking. He'd later say, ""Gentlemen don't get treated very well up here."" Politics ain't a beanbag, as the old saying goes. Attacks define the debate in South Carolina.

Childcare costs rise 5% for children under two,"A report has found parents in England, Scotland and Wales are paying 5% more on childcare for under-twos than a year ago - and 4% more for two-year-olds. Childcare now costs on average more than Â£130 per week for a part-time nursery place for a child under two, according to children's charity Coram. It has called for reform and simplification of childcare system. The government said it was increasing the rate it paid for free childcare provision, and creating more places. The findings ofCoram Family and Childcare's survey,externalsuggest that childcare costs are rising faster than price increases generally, with the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) measure of inflation standing at 1.8% in January. The charity said its survey revealed the average weekly price of a part-time nursery place for a child under the age of two had risen to an average of Â£131.61, or more than Â£6,800 per year. The annual survey is based on data from 175 local authorities gathered between November 2019 and January 2020. Nursery owner 'gets paid more cleaning toilets' The report also found that childcare prices and availability vary significantly depending on where people live. Research showed the most expensive regions were London and the South East, where the cost of 25 hours of nursery care for a child under two is Â£165.47 and Â£144.90 per week respectively. In inner London, the average cost is Â£182.56. The cheapest areas were in Scotland and Yorkshire and the Humber at Â£111.26 and Â£113.76 respectively. Meanwhile, the findings also reveal gaps in availability, with just over half (56%) of local authorities in England having enough childcare for parents working full-time. This is compared to 57% in 2019. There may also be gaps if parents are working outside regular office hours, if children have disabilities and if children are older - aged between 12 to 14, according to the report. The average weekly price for families using an after school club five days a week across Britain was found to be Â£60.99. Coram's report argued that while support, subsidies and free entitlements are available to many families, the system is too complicated - which can leave parents at risk of missing out on help they are entitled to. It has made several suggestions for reforms, including increasing the maximum amount of childcare costs paid under Universal Credit and moving to up-front payments for childcare. Government spending on childcare should be reformed and simplified ""so every parent is better off working after paying for childcare, and every child has access to childcare which supports their learning and development,"" said Claire Harding, head of Coram Family and Childcare. She added: ""Investing in childcare support is good for us all because it helps parents to work now, and boosts children's learning and skills for our future."" The government said investment in childcare and early years education will reach Â£3.6bn in 2020-21 to ""give families the flexibility they need to be able to balance their work and family lives"". In October, the Department for Education said councils across England would receive extra funding to deliver free childcare places, with investment going towards increasing rates. There are different funded childcare schemes across the UK. Since 2017, working parents of three and four-year-olds in England have been entitled to 30 hours' free childcare a week - up from 15 hours. In Wales, working parents of three and four-year-olds are entitled to 30 hours of free childcare a weekfor up to 48 weeks of the year. Parents of three and four-year-olds in Scotland are entitled toaround 16 hours of free childcare a week,externalduring term time.

"Facebook dramas 'consuming council's energy'An independent review says the local authority has a ""debilitating lack of capacity"".Wales politics","The report found a ""debilitating lack of capacity and resilience"" at Merthyr Tydfil council Political dramas on Facebook are consuming enormous energy at a local authority at the expense of other matters, a review has found. Senior officers at Merthyr Tydfil County Borough Council are being asked to be ""referees"" rather than advisors. The council is only just ""keeping its nostrils above the waterline"" and has a projected deficit of Â£15m to 2022-23. Council leader Kevin O'Neill said a decade of austerity had put the council under pressure. Last year the Welsh Government sent in former Swindon council chief executive John Gilbert to advise the authorityafter council leader Kevin O'Neill asked for help. A subsequent review by animprovement board,externalchaired by former Welsh Local Government Association chief executive Steve Thomas found a ""debilitating lack of capacity and resilience"" throughout the council, with the organisation functioning ""by keeping its nostrils above the waterline"". It said there was an ""urgent need"" to address ""poor attainment levels"" in schools, and a ""complete breakdown of trust"" between the council and the trust which runs some leisure services. Council leader Kevin O'Neill asked for help for the authority last year The report says that across the council ""there are political 'hotspots' and 'dramas"" associated ""with a variety of issues"". ""Much of this plays out on social media sites especially Facebook,"" it said. ""The team fully accepts that this is part of the cut and thrust of local politics. ""But in the case of Merthyr Tydfil this can consume enormous organisational energy often at the expense of more important matters."" ""With the debilitating lack of capacity highlighted in this report the council can ill afford to be subsumed by this. ""Senior officers are all too often being asked to play the role of ""referees"" as opposed to professional advisors. This must be addressed with a clearly signalled shift in thinking from antagonistic to strategic."" Council warns of 100 job cuts to balance budget Deeply split Merthyr council seeks help BBC Wales has been told the concerns mainly relate to problems caused by councillors getting involved in rows on a private Facebook page called Merthyr Council Truths.

Other problems included ""significant concerns"" about the ability of the council to deal with ""practical ongoing issues"".

""She also is responsible for HR, legal and a range of other services."" The Welsh Government is appointing extra advisers to help with education, social services, corporate governance and leader, cabinet and member development.

"Childcare costs rise 5% for children under twoA report finds part-time nursery care costs more than Â£130 per week in England, Scotland and Wales.UK","A report has found parents in England, Scotland and Wales are paying 5% more on childcare for under-twos than a year ago - and 4% more for two-year-olds. Childcare now costs on average more than Â£130 per week for a part-time nursery place for a child under two, according to children's charity Coram. It has called for reform and simplification of childcare system. The government said it was increasing the rate it paid for free childcare provision, and creating more places. The findings ofCoram Family and Childcare's survey,externalsuggest that childcare costs are rising faster than price increases generally, with the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) measure of inflation standing at 1.8% in January. The charity said its survey revealed the average weekly price of a part-time nursery place for a child under the age of two had risen to an average of Â£131.61, or more than Â£6,800 per year. The annual survey is based on data from 175 local authorities gathered between November 2019 and January 2020. Nursery owner 'gets paid more cleaning toilets' The report also found that childcare prices and availability vary significantly depending on where people live. Research showed the most expensive regions were London and the South East, where the cost of 25 hours of nursery care for a child under two is Â£165.47 and Â£144.90 per week respectively. In inner London, the average cost is Â£182.56. The cheapest areas were in Scotland and Yorkshire and the Humber at Â£111.26 and Â£113.76 respectively. Meanwhile, the findings also reveal gaps in availability, with just over half (56%) of local authorities in England having enough childcare for parents working full-time. This is compared to 57% in 2019. There may also be gaps if parents are working outside regular office hours, if children have disabilities and if children are older - aged between 12 to 14, according to the report. The average weekly price for families using an after school club five days a week across Britain was found to be Â£60.99. Coram's report argued that while support, subsidies and free entitlements are available to many families, the system is too complicated - which can leave parents at risk of missing out on help they are entitled to. It has made several suggestions for reforms, including increasing the maximum amount of childcare costs paid under Universal Credit and moving to up-front payments for childcare. Government spending on childcare should be reformed and simplified ""so every parent is better off working after paying for childcare, and every child has access to childcare which supports their learning and development,"" said Claire Harding, head of Coram Family and Childcare. She added: ""Investing in childcare support is good for us all because it helps parents to work now, and boosts children's learning and skills for our future."" The government said investment in childcare and early years education will reach Â£3.6bn in 2020-21 to ""give families the flexibility they need to be able to balance their work and family lives"". In October, the Department for Education said councils across England would receive extra funding to deliver free childcare places, with investment going towards increasing rates. There are different funded childcare schemes across the UK. Since 2017, working parents of three and four-year-olds in England have been entitled to 30 hours' free childcare a week - up from 15 hours. In Wales, working parents of three and four-year-olds are entitled to 30 hours of free childcare a weekfor up to 48 weeks of the year. Parents of three and four-year-olds in Scotland are entitled toaround 16 hours of free childcare a week,externalduring term time.

Virgin Galactic sees demand for space travel surgeSir Richard Branson's firm says it is releasing more tickets for flights into space.Business,"Virgin Galactic has said it will release more tickets for flights into space amid surging demand. Sir Richard Branson's firm, which completed its first sub-orbital test flight in 2018, said it had received almost 8,000 registrations of interest for future commercial flights. That is more than double the amount it recorded at the end of September 2019. The firm has so far sold 600 tickets for its inaugural flights, scheduled for later this year. The news comes as Virgin Galactic's latest company results show a net loss of $73m (Â£55.6m) for the last quarter. Branson's Virgin Galactic set for market launch Virgin spaceship moves to operational base Wanted: New astronauts for Nasa Moon mission The billionaires fuelling a space race On Wednesday, the California-based company said it would begin taking $1,000 refundable deposits as it prepares to release the next batch of tickets to the general public. That will put them on a waiting list for when seats become available. However, Virgin Galactic said prices and timing for its next flight were not available yet. Tickets for its inaugural flights retailed at $250,000 apiece. Those to have already purchased tickets include celebrities Justin Bieber and Leonardo DiCaprio. Sir Richard Branson has said he will be on the first trip. ""We have been greatly encouraged by the ongoing and increasing demand seen from around the world for personal spaceflight,"" said Stephen Attenborough, Virgin Galactic's commercial director. Virgin Galactic saw its losses widen in the three months to December, compared with a $46m loss in the same period in 2018. Virgin Galactic is the only publicly-listed space tourism group, having floated on the New York stock exchange last October. The company, along with Elon Musk's SpaceX and Jeff Bezos's Blue Origin, have all been ina race to send tourists into space.

Sickest patients 'facing hours stuck on trolleys',"This video can not be played Working in A&E for the NHS: 'Every day is relentless' Many of the most seriously ill patients are waiting for hours on trolleys and in corridors as the NHS struggles to find them beds, BBC research shows. Nearly a quarter of patients admitted on to wards during December and January in England faced delays of more than four hours before a bed could be found. It has created a backlog outside hospitals with patients brought in by ambulance facing long waits too. Experts warned there was ""little in the tank"" to cope with the coronavirus. There is mounting concern that the spread of the virus will lead to a pandemic with mass outbreaks in the UK. The BBC research - based on analysis of NHS England data - found the delays faced by some of the frailest and sickest patients have risen sharply this winter. The Royal College of Nursing said the situation was unacceptable and treating patients in this way was undignified and put them at risk. NHS England said extra money was being invested which would help hospitals recruit staff and cut waiting times. Kate Milsom was taken to hospital after a fall in January Kate Milsom is one of the many patients who has faced delays. She is 93 and was taken to London's Hillingdon Hospital in January after falling at home. The ambulance came quickly, but when she arrived at the hospital there was a long wait to be seen. She spent more than six hours on a trolley in a corridor - much of the time with the paramedics who had brought her in. ""I was in pain. I had broken my hip before so was really worried. ""The staff were nice... but they were just so busy."" She was eventually found a bed in a bay and was able to go home the following day. The trust said it could not comment on individual cases but acknowledged the busy nature of the hospital meant some patients faced long waits. It said staff were working hard to keep these to an ""absolute minimum"" and all patients were monitored to keep them safe. It is already widely documented thatA&E units have struggled this winter, missing the four-hour target by a record margin. The new BBC analysis looked at waits in England before and after A&E. It showed 199,000 patients had four-hour ""trolley waits"" after being seen in A&E before a bed could be found. That is more than two times higher than the numbers seen four years ago. In some hospitals half of patients had waited more than four hours. Another 130,000 patients brought in by ambulances were left waiting at least 30 minutes before they could be handed over to hospital staff - one in seven of all those brought in over the two-month period. Similar pressures are being seen in other parts of the UK, but because of the way figures are collected direct comparisons cannot be made. The RCN said the situation had got so bad that many hospitals had started deploying nurses to work in corridors, providing treatments such as oxygen and antibiotic drips to patients. RCN emergency care association chairman David Smith said: ""It is not what we want for our patients - it is not dignified and obviously safety is a concern. ""We do our best to make sure they are comfortable and react if they deteriorate. But it is really upsetting for nurses to have to see patients like this."" NHS England medical director Prof Stephen Powis praised the hard work of staff, saying they had ""pulled out all the stops"" amid rising demand. He said extra investment would lead to more staff and extra beds which would help in the future. The implications for a pandemic The coronavirus outbreak could not have come at a worse time. The winter has been the most challenging for a generation for the NHS. The World Health Organization has said governments across the world should prepare for a pandemic - defined as when the virus is being transmitted easily in many countries. There are signs it is spreading, with significant outbreaks reported in Italy, South Korea and Iran. There have only been 13 cases in the UK so far - and all were people who had been infected in Asia, meaning there has been no transmission within the UK. The patients have been treated in the five specialist respiratory centres, but there are plans to use 19 other regional units if needed, with NHS bosses saying there are robust contingency plans in place. Meanwhile, all hospitals have been asked to set up isolation pods in case patients with the virus go to hospital - the official advice is to phone NHS 111 and self-isolate. Don't go to A&E - some hospitals have installed special pods to keep potential coronavirus patients away from others England's chief medical officer Prof Chris Witty said the UK was still working to contain it - and if that did not work the hope was that the spread of the disease could be slowed so cases did not peak in winter. Britain's race to contain the coronavirus Coronavirus: What you need to know But Saffron Cordery, of NHS Providers, which represents hospitals, said with services at ""full stretch"" the additional effort needed to handle a mass outbreak of coronavirus needed extra funding if it was not to ""impinge"" on day-to-day services. Helen Buckingham, of the Nuffield Trust think tank, said the swine flu pandemic from 10 years ago showed the NHS was good at dealing with unexpected new illnesses. But she added it was clear there was ""very little fuel in the tank"" when it came to staff numbers and hospital beds.

"28,000 rough sleepers recorded in a yearFive times as many rough sleepers were seen in a year than reported in the official one-night snapshot.England","This video can not be played 'Homelessness could happen to anybody' More than 28,000 people in the UK were recorded sleeping rough in 12 months, research by the BBC has suggested. In England five times as many rough sleepers were seen by councils in the year than reported in official figures, which are a one-night snapshot. Labour's shadow housing secretary John Healey has called for an investigation into the government's published statistics, calling them ""misleading"". The government said it was providing Â£437m this year to tackle homelessness. It said it believed the official snapshot was a ""good estimate"" of rough sleeping ""on a given night."" New official figures will be released on Thursday but the datafor 2018 showed 4,677people slept rough in England on the one night the snapshot survey was taken, down 2% on the year before but 165% up on 2010. However council responses to the BBC showed nearly 25,000 people were recorded sleeping rough at least once in England during the latest year on record. The BBC asked councils for the number of individuals amid concerns raised last year that the official one-night snapshot did not give the full picture. Mr Healey said he had written to the UK Statistics Authority to ask them to investigate the accuracy of the government's statistics. He said: ""These figures expose the shameful scale of rough sleeping on our country's streets. ""They also confirm that the government's own published statistics are seriously misleading and an unreliable undercount of the number of people sleeping rough."" Nancy Webb has been in and out of hostels for 10 years In Oxford there were 430 rough sleepers recorded during 2019, compared with 43 during the single night count. This meant the city had one of the highest rates of rough sleeping per household population outside London. For the past 10 years Nancy Webb has been in and out of hostels. ""It's dehumanising,"" the 33-year-old said. ""It chips away at you and, once you become homeless, you start to feel trapped and you're going round in circles."" Miss Webb said she had been attacked by other homeless people. ""I have been spat on and had drinks thrown over me and it is terrifying,"" she said. ""I always try and go somewhere hidden if I am sleeping out, but even then it's scary because you don't want to be isolated because that's terrifying and you don't want to be somewhere where people are going to be walking past you, because that's terrifying too."" Stephen Dare was homeless for nine years Stephen Dare has recently been housed in a flat but said he spent most of the past decade homeless. ""I was soaking wet in my sleeping bag for nine years,"" he said. He wants to see quicker access to council housing for homeless people. There are currently 2,645 households on the waiting list for council homes in Oxford, 1,023 of whom are existing tenants. Jane Cranston, chairwoman of the Oxford Homeless Movement, said: ""One of the things that shocked me is a lot of these guys coming in have got jobs, so they are homeless because properties are too expensive,"" she said. Councillor Linda Smith, deputy leader of Oxford City Council, said the number sleeping out on a single night had fallen 30% since 2017. ""There are obviously still too many people sleeping rough in Oxford, but the reduction shows the hard work that we and our partners have put in over the years,"" she said. The council is increasing spending on tackling homelessness from Â£6m a year to Â£7.4m covering beds, showers and meals as well as support for people negotiating with landlords and finding work. It also plans to build 600 new council houses. The government publishes figures for rough sleeping based on the numbers of people seen or estimated to be sleeping rough in each local authority in England on one night in autumn. The BBC asked councils how many individuals they recorded sleeping rough at any stage in 2019 - whether they slept rough once or multiple times - and three quarters replied with figures. Some councils, including Wigan and Doncaster, were unable to provide figures for the number of individuals over the year. Even among those who did it was not possible to say how many of those recorded may have also slept rough in another area. This means some people may have been counted more than once. In Wales the total was 599 rough sleepers but most councils referred to Welsh government statistics rather than providing full-year figures. In Scotlandthe 2,800 recorded came mainly from housing applications in which people said they slept rough during the previous three months. The Northern Ireland Housing Executive only provided an estimate based on a single night snapshot, when it found 38. In London councils referred to CHAIN, a database managed by the charity St Mungo's with the latest full year figures covering 2018-19. In 2019 theOffice for Statistics Regulation,external(OSR) said it expected the government to ""plan for better statistics on rough sleeping"". A spokeswoman said the OSR ""hopes to see the inclusion of improved guidance which clearly sets out the limitations of the current annual snapshot approach in England"". Train lines shut amid rising river levels Schools close as pupils return from Coronavirus-hit Italy The council house may be seeing a revival Central London has consistently had the highest number of rough sleepers. Outside the capital, Hastings recorded the highest rates of individuals per household population out of the councils that replied. Hastings Council said it had halved the number of people sleeping rough on one night since 2018, down from 48 to 24. It said it had used government funding alongside its own money for initiatives including a team of health, mental health, substance dependency, social care and housing specialists providing support for rough sleepers. Nottingham City Council said it knew of 795 individuals who slept rough between April and December 2019, compared with 30 on a typical single night. Councillor Linda Woodings said the number of homeless people had ""undoubtedly risen significantly"" following funding cuts and welfare reforms, but rough sleeping in Nottingham was falling. ""Challenges remain around people unwilling to engage with us to access support available to them, increasing numbers of people arriving from elsewhere and with insufficient affordable housing,"" Councillor Woodings said. ""Also, while we are very successful at bidding for Government grants, it is still not enough to properly address the issue as it continues to grow."" In Greater Manchester the number ofrough sleepers fell by a third in 2019but the region's mayor, Andy Burnham, said despite ""real progress"" there were still too many people on the streets. Rachael Robathan, leader of Westminster City Council, said: ""These figures are a graphic illustration of what anyone visiting central London knows - that rough sleeping is running at unacceptable levels. ""Tonight in Westminster, up to 300 people will be bedding down in doorways and on the streets. We spend more than Â£7m a year in helping people find a life away from the streets and offer more than 500 bed spaces a night, but that isn't halting the rising tide of people bedding down in central London."" Jon Sparkes, chief executive of Crisis, said: ""Rough sleeping is the most brutal form of homelessness but we still do not have a clear picture of how many people are forced to sleep on our streets throughout the year. ""While the current government statistics on rough sleeping are a useful snapshot, based on counting people seen on one night, this cannot hope to accurately reflect the real scale of the problem."" The Local Government Association has called for the government to restore local housing allowance ratesto cover at least the lowest third of market rents. Housing spokesman Councillor David Renard said local authorities needed the power to start a ""renaissance in council house-building"", adding: ""Money allocated to councils is increasingly being spent on providing temporary accommodation, meaning there is less for other homelessness services."" A Government spokesman said: ""We're committed to eliminating rough sleeping by the end of the Parliament and our efforts have already led to the first nationwide fall in a decade."" ""We're confident our independently verified snapshot provides a good estimate of the numbers of people sleeping rough on a given night. This year we will give nearly half a billion pounds to councils and charities to support homelessness and rough sleeping services and get people off the streets for good.""

Rachael Robathan, leader of Westminster City Council, said: ""These figures are a graphic illustration of what anyone visiting central London knows - that rough sleeping is running at unacceptable levels. ""Tonight in Westminster, up to 300 people will be bedding down in doorways and on the streets. We spend more than Â£7m a year in helping people find a life away from the streets and offer more than 500 bed spaces a night, but that isn't halting the rising tide of people bedding down in central London."" Jon Sparkes, chief executive of Crisis, said: ""Rough sleeping is the most brutal form of homelessness but we still do not have a clear picture of how many people are forced to sleep on our streets throughout the year. ""While the current government statistics on rough sleeping are a useful snapshot, based on counting people seen on one night, this cannot hope to accurately reflect the real scale of the problem."" The Local Government Association has called for the government to restore local housing allowance ratesto cover at least the lowest third of market rents. Housing spokesman Councillor David Renard said local authorities needed the power to start a ""renaissance in council house-building"", adding: ""Money allocated to councils is increasingly being spent on providing temporary accommodation, meaning there is less for other homelessness services."" A Government spokesman said: ""We're committed to eliminating rough sleeping by the end of the Parliament and our efforts have already led to the first nationwide fall in a decade."" ""We're confident our independently verified snapshot provides a good estimate of the numbers of people sleeping rough on a given night. This year we will give nearly half a billion pounds to councils and charities to support homelessness and rough sleeping services and get people off the streets for good.""

Sickest patients 'facing hours stuck on trolleys'BBC analysis shows a surge in hospital delays as experts warn 'little in tank' to cope with coronavirus.Health,"This video can not be played Working in A&E for the NHS: 'Every day is relentless' Many of the most seriously ill patients are waiting for hours on trolleys and in corridors as the NHS struggles to find them beds, BBC research shows. Nearly a quarter of patients admitted on to wards during December and January in England faced delays of more than four hours before a bed could be found. It has created a backlog outside hospitals with patients brought in by ambulance facing long waits too. Experts warned there was ""little in the tank"" to cope with the coronavirus. There is mounting concern that the spread of the virus will lead to a pandemic with mass outbreaks in the UK. The BBC research - based on analysis of NHS England data - found the delays faced by some of the frailest and sickest patients have risen sharply this winter. The Royal College of Nursing said the situation was unacceptable and treating patients in this way was undignified and put them at risk. NHS England said extra money was being invested which would help hospitals recruit staff and cut waiting times. Kate Milsom was taken to hospital after a fall in January Kate Milsom is one of the many patients who has faced delays. She is 93 and was taken to London's Hillingdon Hospital in January after falling at home. The ambulance came quickly, but when she arrived at the hospital there was a long wait to be seen. She spent more than six hours on a trolley in a corridor - much of the time with the paramedics who had brought her in. ""I was in pain. I had broken my hip before so was really worried. ""The staff were nice... but they were just so busy."" She was eventually found a bed in a bay and was able to go home the following day. The trust said it could not comment on individual cases but acknowledged the busy nature of the hospital meant some patients faced long waits. It said staff were working hard to keep these to an ""absolute minimum"" and all patients were monitored to keep them safe. It is already widely documented thatA&E units have struggled this winter, missing the four-hour target by a record margin. The new BBC analysis looked at waits in England before and after A&E. It showed 199,000 patients had four-hour ""trolley waits"" after being seen in A&E before a bed could be found. That is more than two times higher than the numbers seen four years ago. In some hospitals half of patients had waited more than four hours. Another 130,000 patients brought in by ambulances were left waiting at least 30 minutes before they could be handed over to hospital staff - one in seven of all those brought in over the two-month period. Similar pressures are being seen in other parts of the UK, but because of the way figures are collected direct comparisons cannot be made. The RCN said the situation had got so bad that many hospitals had started deploying nurses to work in corridors, providing treatments such as oxygen and antibiotic drips to patients. RCN emergency care association chairman David Smith said: ""It is not what we want for our patients - it is not dignified and obviously safety is a concern. ""We do our best to make sure they are comfortable and react if they deteriorate. But it is really upsetting for nurses to have to see patients like this."" NHS England medical director Prof Stephen Powis praised the hard work of staff, saying they had ""pulled out all the stops"" amid rising demand. He said extra investment would lead to more staff and extra beds which would help in the future. The implications for a pandemic The coronavirus outbreak could not have come at a worse time. The winter has been the most challenging for a generation for the NHS. The World Health Organization has said governments across the world should prepare for a pandemic - defined as when the virus is being transmitted easily in many countries. There are signs it is spreading, with significant outbreaks reported in Italy, South Korea and Iran. There have only been 13 cases in the UK so far - and all were people who had been infected in Asia, meaning there has been no transmission within the UK. The patients have been treated in the five specialist respiratory centres, but there are plans to use 19 other regional units if needed, with NHS bosses saying there are robust contingency plans in place. Meanwhile, all hospitals have been asked to set up isolation pods in case patients with the virus go to hospital - the official advice is to phone NHS 111 and self-isolate. Don't go to A&E - some hospitals have installed special pods to keep potential coronavirus patients away from others England's chief medical officer Prof Chris Witty said the UK was still working to contain it - and if that did not work the hope was that the spread of the disease could be slowed so cases did not peak in winter. Britain's race to contain the coronavirus Coronavirus: What you need to know But Saffron Cordery, of NHS Providers, which represents hospitals, said with services at ""full stretch"" the additional effort needed to handle a mass outbreak of coronavirus needed extra funding if it was not to ""impinge"" on day-to-day services. Helen Buckingham, of the Nuffield Trust think tank, said the swine flu pandemic from 10 years ago showed the NHS was good at dealing with unexpected new illnesses. But she added it was clear there was ""very little fuel in the tank"" when it came to staff numbers and hospital beds.

Chancellor must raise taxes in first Budget - IFSA think tank says Rishi Sunak risks breaking the rules on borrowing if he is to boost public spending.UK Politics,"The new chancellor must raise taxes in his first Budget or break the government's rules on borrowing, a leading economic think tank has warned. Rishi Sunak is under pressure to increase spending on the NHS, social care and schools. He has also inherited a fiscal target from his predecessor Sajid Javid to bring spending in to balance by 2022. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has suggested this will not be possible without increasing taxes. It said that loosening or abandoning the rules, set out in last year'sConservative election manifesto,external, would undermine the credibility of any fiscal targets the government set. However, the Conservative election manifesto said the government would not put up income tax, national insurance or VAT. Mr Sunak, who was appointed chancellor after Mr Javid's dramatic resignation in the cabinet reshuffle, will deliver the statement on 11 March. The Budget is the government's yearly announcement of its plans for tax and spending for the coming financial year, which starts in April. What was in the Conservative manifesto? Sajid Javid quits as chancellor Who is the new chancellor Rishi Sunak? The chancellor is understood to be facing pressure from Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his chief advisor Dominic Cummings to loosen spending constraints. The IFS said that even on current policy, borrowing next year could be Â£63bn, Â£23bn more than the most recent official forecast, putting Mr Javid's fiscal target in doubt. Taking into account the government's commitment to increasing investment spending, it added that even getting the current budget into balance would not be enough to bring down underlying debt over the course of the Parliament. Loosening or abandoning the current fiscal rule now would put debt on a clearly rising path, according to the IFS analysis. ""That would not be sustainable in the long-term,"" it said. The IFS has suggested alternative ways for raising revenue, including lifting the freeze on fuel duty to give the government Â£4bn more in revenue throughout Parliament. It also said abolishing entrepreneurs' relief in capital gains tax and increasing council tax for those living in more expensive properties could form part of a ""desirable package"" of reforms. Tory MPs have warned the chancellor against asking motorists to pay more in tax But such schemes could prove politically difficult. Some 18 Conservative MPs - including those from seats won last year for the first time since the war - have written to the chancellor warning him that raising fuel duty would ""clobber blue collar communities"". The Harlow MP Robert Halfon toldthe Conservative Home website,externalthat fuel duty was a ""totemic tax"" for many people and levels were already among the highest in Europe. ""If the Treasury really wants to flash multiple V-signs at the millions of blue-collar voters who lent us their vote, then putting up fuel duty would be a sure way of going about it,"" he wrote. IFS director Paul Johnson said Mr Sunak was ""hemmed in"" by a rising deficit and fiscal targets set out in the Conservative manifesto but he  should ""recognise that more spending must require more tax"". He added: ""They will allow him to increase investment spending, which will be welcome if well targeted. But they will not allow substantial increases in current spending, or tax cuts, to be funded by more borrowing. ""We have already had 16 fiscal targets in a decade, and fiscal targets should not just be for Christmas. ""Mr Sunak should resist the temptation to announce another and instead recognise that more spending must require more tax."" Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said 10 years of ""chaotic and erratic"" government under the Conservatives had seen 16 fiscal targets ""proposed and ripped up"". He added that the IFS report showed the ""damage done by a decade of decline"". ""Despite all the hype about this budget turning a page, it risks setting in train five years of disappointment.""

High stakes debate has Sanders in the crosshairs,"This video can not be played Attacks on Sanders and Bloomberg define the debate in South Carolina The Democratic presidential candidate debate in Charleston, South Carolina, reprised a piece of political theatre similar to a performance six days earlier in Las Vegas. On stage in Nevada last week, the debate played out like a dinner-theatre murder mystery. Michael Bloomberg was the victim, while everyone else on the stage had a motive and the means to do him in. This time, on Tuesday night, it was Bernie Sanders who got the rhetorical bludgeoning. It was the last debate before South Carolina votes on Saturday - followed by 14 other states next Tuesday - and was full of tense moments and sharp exchanges, reflecting the high stakes. Right at the top, former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg referenced a recent report that Russia was attempting to boost Sanders's presidential campaign. ""Vladimir Putin thinks that Donald Trump should be president of the United States,"" he said. ""And that's why Russia is helping you get elected, so you will lose to him."" For two hours, Sanders faced slings and arrows from his opponents Elizabeth Warren, who hasn't often taken swipes at Sanders, said they both wanted universal healthcare, but she ""dug in"" and ""did the work"" to pay for her plan, and ""Bernie's team trashed me for it"". After facing pressure from his opponents, Sanders backed away from his 2005 vote to protect gun manufacturers from legal liability for deaths from their products - a rare admission of error from the Vermont senator. ""I have cast thousands of votes, including bad votes,"" he said. ""That was a bad vote."" US election 2020 : All you need to know about the presidential race Meet the Democrats vying to take on Trump He stood behind his recent praise of communist Cuba's literacy programmes (while still condemning the nation's human rights abuses.) ""Really? Literacy programs are bad?"" Sanders exclaimed. ""Occasionally it might be a good idea to be honest about American foreign policy. America has overthrown governments all over the world."" For two hours, Sanders faced slings and arrows from his opponents. He responded in typical Sanders fashion, with tried and true lines his supporters can probably recite from heart at this point. It has worked for him so far. It wasn't the fight most people were anticipating, but it was one they probably should have expected. Biden has his back to the wall in South Carolina, where he needs a win if he wants to keep his hopes of winning the nomination alive. Joe Biden showed a fire and a sense of urgency he's lacked in previous engagements While Tom Steyer hasn't been much of a factor nationally, the self-funded billionaire candidate has spent heavily in South Carolina - and eaten into the former vice-president's support there. On Tuesday night, Biden tried to take him down a peg, by criticising Steyer's investment in a company that ran private prisons cited for human-rights abuses. When Steyer replied that he had sold his stock and had helped fund a bank to support black-owned businesses, Biden was ready with his rejoinder. ""Where we come from, that's called Tommy come lately,"" he quipped. It may not have been the knockout blow Biden needed, but throughout the debate he showed a fire and a sense of urgency he's lacked in previous engagements. Now, he has to hope that it's enough to give him a second lease of electoral life. The Bloomberg campaign promised that Tuesday night's debate would go much better than last week's. They were right, although it had less to do with the candidate's performance than his opponents deciding they had bigger fish (Sanders) to fry. Michael Bloomberg (left) and Elizabeth Warren (centre) again traded accusations That didn't stop the former mayor from almost torpedoing his candidacy again, by verbally stumbling and nearly saying that he ""bought"" - instead of ""got"" - all the winning candidates who enabled the Democratic takeover of the House of Representatives in the 2018 mid-term elections. And then there was Elizabeth Warren, Bloomberg's nemesis last week, who made yet another run at the billionaire and his past funding of Republican candidates. ""I don't care how much money Mayor Bloomberg has,"" she said. ""The core of the Democratic Party will never trust him. He has not earned their trust."" Bloomberg had a few bright moments, boasting of his economic and social policy record in New York City and highlighting his support for gun control. It's clear at this point, however, that his strongest campaign asset will be his limitless resources, not rhetorical flourishes in the debate hall. It was a chaotic, sprawling debate, with candidates often talking over each other and the moderators. Many times their answers went on beyond the allotted time. ""I know it goes fast, but a minute 15 is really a long time,"" Gale King, one of the hosts, admonished Pete Buttigieg. At one point, Joe Biden expressed exasperation, sardonically saying, ""I know how you cut me off every time, but I'm not going to be quiet anymore."" Then he stopped talking. He'd later say, ""Gentlemen don't get treated very well up here."" Politics ain't a beanbag, as the old saying goes. Attacks define the debate in South Carolina.

High stakes debate has Sanders in the crosshairsThe televised showdown before South Carolina and Super Tuesday primaries was a series of messy attacks.US & Canada,"This video can not be played Attacks on Sanders and Bloomberg define the debate in South Carolina The Democratic presidential candidate debate in Charleston, South Carolina, reprised a piece of political theatre similar to a performance six days earlier in Las Vegas. On stage in Nevada last week, the debate played out like a dinner-theatre murder mystery. Michael Bloomberg was the victim, while everyone else on the stage had a motive and the means to do him in. This time, on Tuesday night, it was Bernie Sanders who got the rhetorical bludgeoning. It was the last debate before South Carolina votes on Saturday - followed by 14 other states next Tuesday - and was full of tense moments and sharp exchanges, reflecting the high stakes. Right at the top, former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg referenced a recent report that Russia was attempting to boost Sanders's presidential campaign. ""Vladimir Putin thinks that Donald Trump should be president of the United States,"" he said. ""And that's why Russia is helping you get elected, so you will lose to him."" For two hours, Sanders faced slings and arrows from his opponents Elizabeth Warren, who hasn't often taken swipes at Sanders, said they both wanted universal healthcare, but she ""dug in"" and ""did the work"" to pay for her plan, and ""Bernie's team trashed me for it"". After facing pressure from his opponents, Sanders backed away from his 2005 vote to protect gun manufacturers from legal liability for deaths from their products - a rare admission of error from the Vermont senator. ""I have cast thousands of votes, including bad votes,"" he said. ""That was a bad vote."" US election 2020 : All you need to know about the presidential race Meet the Democrats vying to take on Trump He stood behind his recent praise of communist Cuba's literacy programmes (while still condemning the nation's human rights abuses.) ""Really? Literacy programs are bad?"" Sanders exclaimed. ""Occasionally it might be a good idea to be honest about American foreign policy. America has overthrown governments all over the world."" For two hours, Sanders faced slings and arrows from his opponents. He responded in typical Sanders fashion, with tried and true lines his supporters can probably recite from heart at this point. It has worked for him so far. It wasn't the fight most people were anticipating, but it was one they probably should have expected. Biden has his back to the wall in South Carolina, where he needs a win if he wants to keep his hopes of winning the nomination alive. Joe Biden showed a fire and a sense of urgency he's lacked in previous engagements While Tom Steyer hasn't been much of a factor nationally, the self-funded billionaire candidate has spent heavily in South Carolina - and eaten into the former vice-president's support there. On Tuesday night, Biden tried to take him down a peg, by criticising Steyer's investment in a company that ran private prisons cited for human-rights abuses. When Steyer replied that he had sold his stock and had helped fund a bank to support black-owned businesses, Biden was ready with his rejoinder. ""Where we come from, that's called Tommy come lately,"" he quipped. It may not have been the knockout blow Biden needed, but throughout the debate he showed a fire and a sense of urgency he's lacked in previous engagements. Now, he has to hope that it's enough to give him a second lease of electoral life. The Bloomberg campaign promised that Tuesday night's debate would go much better than last week's. They were right, although it had less to do with the candidate's performance than his opponents deciding they had bigger fish (Sanders) to fry. Michael Bloomberg (left) and Elizabeth Warren (centre) again traded accusations That didn't stop the former mayor from almost torpedoing his candidacy again, by verbally stumbling and nearly saying that he ""bought"" - instead of ""got"" - all the winning candidates who enabled the Democratic takeover of the House of Representatives in the 2018 mid-term elections. And then there was Elizabeth Warren, Bloomberg's nemesis last week, who made yet another run at the billionaire and his past funding of Republican candidates. ""I don't care how much money Mayor Bloomberg has,"" she said. ""The core of the Democratic Party will never trust him. He has not earned their trust."" Bloomberg had a few bright moments, boasting of his economic and social policy record in New York City and highlighting his support for gun control. It's clear at this point, however, that his strongest campaign asset will be his limitless resources, not rhetorical flourishes in the debate hall. It was a chaotic, sprawling debate, with candidates often talking over each other and the moderators. Many times their answers went on beyond the allotted time. ""I know it goes fast, but a minute 15 is really a long time,"" Gale King, one of the hosts, admonished Pete Buttigieg. At one point, Joe Biden expressed exasperation, sardonically saying, ""I know how you cut me off every time, but I'm not going to be quiet anymore."" Then he stopped talking. He'd later say, ""Gentlemen don't get treated very well up here."" Politics ain't a beanbag, as the old saying goes. Attacks define the debate in South Carolina.

Disney boss Bob Iger steps down as chief executiveThe businessman is considered the most powerful man in Hollywood.,"Bob Iger has led Disney since 2005 Disney boss Bob Iger, who led the media company through several blockbuster acquisitions and the launch of a streaming network, is stepping down as chief executive. Disney said it had appointed Bob Chapek, who previously ran the company's parks and products division, to replace him. Mr Iger will remain Disney's executive chairman until the end of next year to direct ""creative endeavours"". The move came as a surprise. Mr Iger, who is considered by many to be the most powerful man in Hollywood, had served as chief executive since 2005. He has previously announced plans to retire only to push back his departure date. In a statement,externalon Tuesday, Mr Iger said it was the ""optimal time"" to begin to hand control of the company to a new leader. Disney recentlycompleted the acquisitionof Rupert Murdoch's 21st Century Fox entertainment empire and launched theDisney+streaming channel late last year. Earlier, Mr Iger presided over the firm's acquisition of Pixar, Marvel and Lucasfilm. ""The company has gotten larger and more complex just in the recent 12 months,"" Mr Iger said on a conference call on Tuesday. ""I felt that with the asset bases in place and with our strategy deployed I should be spending as much time as possible on the creative side of our business."" Remaining as executive chairman would ease the transition, he added. Mr Chapek oversaw the opening of the Shanghai Disney Resort Mr Chapek, who joined Disney in 1993, will be the firm's seventh chief executive since it was formed in the 1920s. In his prior role, among other achievements, he oversaw the opening of Disney's park in Shanghai. ""His tremendous understanding of the breadth and depth of the Company and appreciation for the special connection between Disney and its consumers makes him the perfect choice,"" said Disney board member Susan Arnold. Shares in the firm fell 2% in after-hours trading after the news was announced. Mr Iger, who recently published a memoir, is much beloved by investors for his record steering the company to steady profits, despite upheaval in the television and movie industries. Disney claimed seven of the top 10 box office hits globally last year and the new streaming channel has already attracted more than 28 million paying customers. The firm's market value has increased five-fold during his tenure, Ms Arnold said. The firm is now worth about $230bn.

British Airways is allowing customers with flights to northern Italy until 2 March - including to Milan or Venice - to rebook for a later date or another destination. The quarantined towns in Italy are Bertonico, Casalpusterlengo, Castelgerundo, Castiglione d'Adda, Codogno, Fombio, Maleo, San Fiorano, Somaglia, Terranova dei Passerini - all in Lodi province in Lombardy - and Vo' Euganeo in Padova province, Veneto.

Your rights as a traveller Major events in northern Italy have been cancelled, cut short or rescheduled, including the Venice Carnival and Bologna book fair. The updated health advice,externalmeans people returning from these Italian towns, or Iran, parts of South Korea and Hubei province in China - where the outbreak began - are being asked to call NHS 111, stay indoors and avoid contact with others, even if they do not have symptoms. Mr Hancock said he was not aware of any British citizens currently in the Italian quarantine area, but he said anyone there should contact the embassy in Rome. This video can not be played Coronavirus in the UK: 5 things you need to know about Covid-19 The main signs of infection are fever (high temperature) and a cough as well as shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. Frequent handwashing with soap or gel, avoiding close contact with people who are ill and not touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands can help cut the risk of infection. Catching coughs and sneezes in a tissue, binning it and washing your hands can minimise the risk of spreading disease. Anyone experiencing symptoms, after travelling from mainland China, Thailand, Japan, Republic of Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia or Macau in the last 14 days, is advised to stay indoors and call the NHS 111 phone service, even if symptoms are mild. If you have returned from the following specific areas since February 19, you should call NHS 111 and stay indoors and avoid contact with other people, even if you do not have symptoms: Iran, lockdown areas in Northern Italy, special care zones in South Korea, and Hubei province. If you have returned from the following areas since February 19 and develop symptoms - even mild ones - stay indoors, avoid contact with others and call NHS 111: northern Italy (above but not including Pisa, Florence and Rimini), Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar. The main focus for the government is on rapidly identifying people with the disease and taking them to specialist hospitals for treatment in isolation. They are then tracing anybody who has come into close contact with the patient to make sure they know the signs of the disease and what to do. After the World Health Organization warned that countries should do more to prepare for a possible pandemic, the health secretary said that the UK had already done ""a huge amount of work"". ""Once it gets to that point there isn't a way to stop it coming into the UK in a big way,"" Mr Hancock said. ""It is not yet clear that it will become a pandemic - the number of cases in China has been slowing over the last couple of weeks and we are relatively confident that information is correct."" In other developments worldwide: China reported 508 new infections on Monday as the death toll rose by 71 to 2,663 In South Korea, 10 people have died after contracting the virus, with the number of people infected reaching 977 Japan has now confined more than 850 people with the virus, mostly from the quarantined Diamond Princess cruise liner Three more deaths have been recorded in Iran, state media says, bringing the death toll there to 15 Mr Hancock said if other countries where the number of cases are growing ""get their response right"", there was still the possibility that the outbreak will remain small in the UK. ""We still expect more cases but at the moment there are 13 cases in the UK,"" he added. How has coronavirus affected your trip in Italy?

CCTV captures bomber seconds before Arena blast,"Salman Abedi in the foyer of the Manchester Arena just seconds before he blew himself up Footage of Manchester Arena bomber Salman Abedi seconds before he blew himself up has been shown to jurors. The CCTV pictures showed him standing amid crowds of men, women and children 19 seconds before the fatal blast on 22 May 2017. Hashem Abedi, 22, is on trial at the Old Bailey, accused of helping his brother plan the attack at the end of the Ariana Grande concert. He denies 22 murders, attempted murder, and conspiring to cause explosions. Salman Abedi detonated a homemade device packed with shrapnel as 359 people milled around the arena foyer at 22:31 BST - one minute after the concert ended. The suicide attack left 22 people dead and hundreds more injured, the jury was told. In the footage, the bomber was seen wearing a large Karrimor rucksack containing the device. Salman Abedi arriving at Manchester Victoria station carrying his rucksack The court heard his body was recovered in four parts and was riddled with nuts, wire and metal parts after the blast.  He was identified by his DNA and fingerprints taken in 2012 when he was arrested for shoplifting. Forensic investigators later found more than 2,000 nuts at the scene. The Old Bailey heard all living casualties were moved out by 23:30 BST and 19 people were confirmed dead at the scene. The father of 15-year-old victim Megan Hurley remained with her body until after 01:00 BST, the court heard.

Donna Currie, 51, who was waiting in the foyer for her daughter and her friend, suffered multiple fractures to both legs and shrapnel wounds. She had previously sustained shrapnel injuries in the 1996 IRA bombing in Manchester and experienced extensive psychological trauma. The court heard that a 50-year-old woman, who suffered shrapnel and burn wounds, had also been caught up in the 1993 IRA bombings in Warrington. She had been waiting with a friend to collect their daughters when she was hurt at the arena. Salman Abedi arriving at Manchester Victoria just over an hour before he detonated his bomb The court previously heard that Salman Abedi, 22, went to the arena days before the attack and watched music fans arrive for a Take That gig. He was seen looking at box office queues, a few yards from the spot where he detonated the bomb. The Old Bailey heard that on the day of the blast, he had arranged to send Â£460 to Libya. Later, he went out with his rucksack and took a Metrolink tram to Victoria Station in Manchester. While waiting for the tram, he made a call lasting just over four minutes to his family in Libya, the court heard. He then waited in the area of the arena for two hours before detonating his device. Jurors have heard that Hashem Abedi insists he is not an extremist and had no idea of his older brother's plans. He said he was in Libya with his family at the time of the attack. The trial continues. Salman Abedi gets in a lift to take him to the Arena foyer CCTV captures bomber at Arena days before attack Arena attacker 'encouraged teen to build a bomb' Arena attack brother insulted man after crash Arena attack brother's garden 'full of metal tins' Arena bomb parts 'bought by pair using mum's card' Arena attack sibling 'shocked' at murderous plot Arena attack brother used 'slaughter' email name Arena attack brother 'foiled in bid to buy acid' Arena attack brother 'equally guilty of murders' HM Courts & Tribunals Service LIVE: Power cut hits Manchester city centre Full list of ambulance A&E handover delays at Greater Manchester hospital trusts Council to draw down Â£17.6m exceptional financial support to balance books Bolton weather forecast: Cold and clear skies this weekend Bury weather forecast: Cold and dry weekend ahead Places where you can go to keep warm as temperatures plummet Locals find homes reduced to ash as fears grow of more fierce winds spreading LA fires Climate 'whiplash' linked to raging LA fires Watch: The moment five US presidents gather at Jimmy Carter's funeral The '9/11 mastermind' is set to plead guilty.

The CCTV pictures showed him standing amid crowds of men, women and children 19 seconds before the fatal blast on 22 May 2017. Hashem Abedi, 22, is on trial at the Old Bailey, accused of helping his brother plan the attack at the end of the Ariana Grande concert. He denies 22 murders, attempted murder, and conspiring to cause explosions. Salman Abedi detonated a homemade device packed with shrapnel as 359 people milled around the arena foyer at 22:31 BST - one minute after the concert ended. The suicide attack left 22 people dead and hundreds more injured, the jury was told. In the footage, the bomber was seen wearing a large Karrimor rucksack containing the device. Salman Abedi arriving at Manchester Victoria station carrying his rucksack The court heard his body was recovered in four parts and was riddled with nuts, wire and metal parts after the blast.  He was identified by his DNA and fingerprints taken in 2012 when he was arrested for shoplifting. Forensic investigators later found more than 2,000 nuts at the scene. The Old Bailey heard all living casualties were moved out by 23:30 BST and 19 people were confirmed dead at the scene.

Donna Currie, 51, who was waiting in the foyer for her daughter and her friend, suffered multiple fractures to both legs and shrapnel wounds. She had previously sustained shrapnel injuries in the 1996 IRA bombing in Manchester and experienced extensive psychological trauma. The court heard that a 50-year-old woman, who suffered shrapnel and burn wounds, had also been caught up in the 1993 IRA bombings in Warrington.

Later, he went out with his rucksack and took a Metrolink tram to Victoria Station in Manchester. While waiting for the tram, he made a call lasting just over four minutes to his family in Libya, the court heard. He then waited in the area of the arena for two hours before detonating his device. Jurors have heard that Hashem Abedi insists he is not an extremist and had no idea of his older brother's plans. He said he was in Libya with his family at the time of the attack.

"Virus spread to US 'inevitable', officials warn","A Kobe Bryant fan wears a mask to his memorial service in LA on Monday Health officials in the US have warned Americans to brace for the ""inevitable"" spread of the coronavirus disease that is sweeping the world. There are 53 confirmed cases in the US, and officials are calling on Congress to urgently pass billions of dollars to fund the response effort. On Wednesday in South Korea, the first case of coronavirus in the US military was confirmed at a military base. The 23-year-old soldier is now under self-quarantine,US Forces Korea said.,external President Trump had claimed that the spread of coronavirus was ""well under control"". More than 2,700 people have died and some 80,000 have been taken ill, mostly in China where the virus originated. Outside China, Iran, South Korea and Italy have reported the largest number of cases causing concern that the virus could be becoming a pandemic. The first positive virus test has been recorded in Latin America - a 61-year-old Brazilian resident who had just returned from Italy.  Local media reported that the man would be tested again for final confirmation. On Tuesday, US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and Prevention experts warned Americans of the coming outbreak. ""We are asking the American public to prepare for the expectation that this might be bad,"" said Dr Nancy Messonnier of the National Center for Immunisation and Respiratory Diseases in a conference call with reporters on Tuesday. ""It's not so much a question of if this will happen in this country any more but a question of when this will happen,"" she said, adding: ""Disruption to everyday life might be severe."" What is coronavirus and what are the symptoms? Analysis: How close are we to a pandemic? The warning marks a change of tone for the CDC, which, until now, has largely been focused on efforts to stop the contagion from entering the country and on quarantining people who have travelled from China. This video can not be played Epidemic v pandemic: What's the difference? So far, 14 patients have been diagnosed with Covid-19 inside the US, while another 39 people have been diagnosed outside the US but are being treated in the country. A pharmacy in California warns of shortages in gloves and masks CDC health officials have outlined measures that schools and business may need to take, including limiting the size of classrooms, and employing ""internet-based tele-schooling"". ""For adults, businesses can replace in-person meetings with video or telephone conferences and increase tele-working options,"" said Dr Messonnier. Hospitals also may need to postpone elective surgeries, she warned, and increase video conferencing capabilities for treating patients remotely. A vaccine will not be ready for more than a year, they say. Meanwhile US Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Alex Azar has asked a Senate subcommittee to approve $2.5 bn (Â£1.9 bn) in funding to fight the outbreak. ""We cannot hermetically seal off the United States to a virus,"" he told lawmakers. ""And we need to be realistic about that."" The money, he said, would pay for the US to expand its surveillance systems for the virus, would support local and state governments, and would help scientists develop vaccines. Fears of a pandemic sent the Dow Jones and S&P 500 stock indices tumbling. The US indices saw their biggest four day percentage drop since December 2018. Mr Azar also said the US needed to expand its stockpiles of protective equipment, like surgical masks. He said that right now the US has a stockpile of about 30 million masks, but it actually needs 300 million to supply to healthcare workers. Earlier in the day President Donald Trump told reporters during a news conference in India that the disease is ""very well under control in our country"". ""I think the whole situation will start working out,"" he added. What you need to know A visual guide to the outbreak Tell us how you've been affected by emailinghaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external.
