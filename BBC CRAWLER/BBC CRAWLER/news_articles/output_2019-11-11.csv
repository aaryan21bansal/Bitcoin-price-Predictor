Mexico offers asylum to Bolivia's ex-president,"Morales supporters clashed with police in La Paz Evo Morales has landed in Mexico where he has been offered asylum after resigning as president of Bolivia amid election fraud protests. In a tweet, he said it hurt to be leaving Bolivia but he would return with more ""strength and energy"". Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard said a Mexican government plane was sent for Mr Morales. Meanwhile, Bolivia's military commander ordered troops to back up police who have clashed with Morales supporters. Some 20 people were reported injured in the clashes. Mr Morales earlier urged his supporters to resist the ""dark powers"" that had forced him to step down. He also tweeted a photo of what he described as ""my first night after leaving the presidency forced out by the coup [organised by opposition leader Carlos] Mesa and [opposition activist Luis Fernando] Camacho with the help of the police"".

The deputy head of the Senate, Jeanine ÃÃ±ez, has said she will take over as interim president until new elections are held. Highs and lows of Evo Morales' presidency Why protesters are on the streets worldwide Mr Morales, a former coca farmer, was first elected in 2006. He has won plaudits for fighting poverty and improving Bolivia's economy but drew controversy by defying constitutional term limits to run for a fourth term in October's election, which is alleged to have been rife with irregularities. Up in El Alto, a city that sits high above La Paz in the Andes, life felt like it had stopped. The cable car that connects the two cities was paralysed, its cabins bobbing in the air in silence. And a normally bustling market place was deserted, stalls shut for fear of looting. Dania was one of the only shopkeepers willing to take a risk. She needs the money, she says. A supporter of Evo Morales, she says his resignation was nothing short of a coup. Crossing the market, Lucy Choque makes her way to work through the burning rubber tyres that were set alight overnight. She just wants the whole thing to be over.

Mexico has a left-leaning government and has supported Mr Morales. Evo Morales supporters fought running battles with police in La Paz on Monday Mr Ebrard earlier described events in Bolivia as a ""coup"", citing the military's involvement in Mr Morales' resignation. Pressure had been growing on Mr Morales since his narrow victory in last month's presidential election. On Sunday, events moved swiftly. First, the Organization of American States, a regional body, announced its audit of the election had found ""clear manipulation"" and called for the result to be annulled. In response, Mr Morales agreed to hold fresh elections. But his main rival, Carlos Mesa - who came second in the vote - said Mr Morales should not stand in any new vote. What really seemed to tip the balance was the intervention of the chief of the armed forces, Gen Williams Kaliman, who urged Mr Morales to step down in the interests of peace and stability. This video can not be played Watch Evo Morales announce his resignation Announcing his resignation, Mr Morales said he had taken the decision in order to stop fellow socialist leaders from being ""harassed, persecuted and threatened"". He also called his removal a ""coup"". Reports say Mr Morales made the announcement of his resignation from El Chapare, a coca-growing rural area of Cochabamba and a bastion of support for him and his Mas party. Opponents of Mr Morales have been celebrating across Bolivia, setting off fireworks and waving national flags, while his supporters clashed with police in the cities of La Paz and El Alto, according to local media reports.  13 years, 9 monthsin power 38 yearsleading the coca growers' union 54%of the votes won in 2005 election 64%of the votes won in 2009 election 61%of votes won in 2014 election Argentines and Bolivians also took to the streets of Buenos Aires on Monday to protest against his resignation. US President Donald Trump on Monday described the resignation as ""a significant moment for democracy in the Western Hemisphere"". The Russian foreign ministry said a ""wave of violence unleashed by the opposition"" had not allowed the ""presidential mandate of Evo Morales to be completed"". The Cuban president, Miguel DÃ­az Canel, tweeted that what happened was ""a violent and cowardly coup d'etat against democracy in Bolivia by the right"". Socialist-led countries Nicaragua and Venezuela also expressed solidarity with Mr Morales. Spain expressed its concern over the role of Bolivia's army, saying that ""this intervention takes us back to moments in the past history of Latin America"". Ms ÃÃ±ez's announcement that she would take over temporarily came after Vice-President Ãlvaro GarcÃ­a, Senate leader Adriana Salvatierra and House of Deputies' leader Victor Borda had all resigned, leaving her next in line. ""I assume this challenge with the only objective to call new elections,"" she said. ""This is simply a transitional phase."" This video can not be played Bolivia crisis: Watch Jeanine ÃÃ±ez's impassioned plea for calm The legislative assembly is expected to meet later on Tuesday to decide whether to confirm her as interim president. With Mr Morales's party in control of both the Senate and the House of Deputies it is not clear if she will get the necessary backing from legislators.

Medieval wall collapses on house and garden,"This video can not be played A section Lewes Castle's boundary wall has collapsed onto a neighbouring house A medieval castle's 600-tonne wall collapsed on to a house and garden in Lewes sparking a major search. Emergency services, including a hazardous area response team and sniffer dogs, went to the scene of the collapse of the 10m (32ft) by 10m wall. When the alert first came in at 12:22 GMT, it was not known if anyone was trapped and dogs trained for use in earthquake zones were deployed. Firefighters later tweeted the search was over with no casualties found. Incident commander Matt Lloyd said the wall had fallen into an adjacent garden and house. The wall formed part of the defences of the 1,000-year-old castle The wall had been reportedly undergoing work to remove ivy in recent weeks. A spokeswoman for castle owners Sussex Archaeological Society said the wall that collapsed was privately-owned and the section that had fallen was part of the curtain wall that ran round the entire outside of the 1,000-year-old landmark. The castle was privately owned and used as a folly before it was given to the archaeological society It was one of the last remaining sections of the historic defence wall, she said, adding: ""There's not much of it left standing. It's one of the last sections that was still at full height."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

LiveLiveFarage pulls candidates and Lib Dems challenge debate line-up6 minutes ago6 minutes ago Goodnight from usGoodnight from us7 minutes ago In summary: What's happened today?In summary: What's happened today?13 minutes ago Lib Dem candidate Kevin McNamara apologises and resigns over tweetsLib Dem candidate Kevin McNamara apologises and resigns over tweets,"General election campaign enters its second week ahead of 12 December poll Nigel Farage announces The Brexit Party will not contest seats the Tories won in 2017 Boris Johnson welcomes the move, but other parties use it to criticise the PM Sidelined Brexit Party candidates will not be compensated for the time and money spent on their campaigns, Nigel Farage says in LBC interview Lib Dems begin legal action against ITV over a head-to-head election debate Labour and the Conservatives mark Armistice Day with a focus on armed forces personnel UK economic growth slows to its lowest rate in almost a decade, but recession is avoided Francesca Gillett That's it for our live election coverage for today, thanks for reading. Here's our top story on the main news of today. And check back tomorrow for the news from day seven of the election campaign. So there ends the sixth day in the official election campaign. There's still plenty more to come, with four weeks and two days until the poll on 12 December. Here's a recap of what happened today: Kevin McNamara - the candidate for Thurrock who is being investigated over tweets he allegedly posted - has resigned, a Lib Dem spokesperson says. ""A
disciplinary process has been instigated,"" they added. Screen shots circulated on Twitter show tweets Mr
McNamara allegedly sent, including racist and homophobic language. In a statement, Mr McNamara says he is ""deeply sorry"" for the comments. âThese words are deeply offensive and I apologise profusely to
everybody that I have offended with these tweets,"" he adds. âI
would never want to undermine the voices of those communities with slurs or
degradation and it's important that people who want to represent the public are
held to the very highest standard. I am resigning as a candidate with immediate
effect for the upcoming election. âI
apologise to all of those I have let down with my past conduct and will work
hard to regain their trust."" The Express calls it a ""huge election boost"" for Mr Johnson, adding that his announcement ""electrified"" the Tories' campaign. Polling experts say Mr Farage's move might not be enough to hand the Tories a majority, the Mail says. The Times reports that cabinet ministers have warned that Nigel Farage will be personally to
blame if Britain does not leave the EU, urging him to pull out of every marginal seat. And the Star also leads with a non-election story. The creator of Grange Hill wants the BBC to bring back his school drama, arguing it could help teach youngsters about things like knife crime. The Daily Mirror does not lead with an election story - but its top story on the flooding in the north of England does refer to the Tories' spending on flood defences. The Guardian calls it a ""dramatic public U-turn"" from Nigel Farage - and reports that senior Tories are now pressing behind the scenes for further concessions. Laura KuenssbergBBC political editor First of all, this does clearly gives Boris Johnson an easier time in some of the seats that the Tories need to hold - there's no question about that. But second of all, if he wants to get the majority that he craves, the Tories have to be taking seats from the other parties and particularly in this context, from Brexit voters who normally vote Labour. Now in a really tightly-fought seat - somewhere where it's really close between Labour and the Conservaive Party - if those natural Labour voters who were Brexiteers decide to go for the Brexit Party then the Tory Party would be very likely to come up short in their competition to get the majority that they crave. But the third thing to say about all of this. It was not so long ago that  in the European elections in the spring that Nigel Farage's Brexit Party looked like they had the chance of sweeping through the political establishment. That was his dream. And today he has been shown to have fallen well short of that. Of course his party is still likely to have an impact on this election. But in the words of one insider in Westminster tonight, it's like the finish line has been moved a little bit, but it's basically still the same race. The Telegraph says Mr Farage ""bowed to immense pressure from within his whole party"". Chris DoidgeBBC Radio Derby, political reporter The Conservative prospective candidate for Burton, Andrew Griffiths, has failed to win the backing of local Conservative Party members. A vote of the local association was split 50/50 - meaning the contest will be opened up to other candidates tomorrow. It's unclear whether Mr Griffiths will continue to pursue the nomination. The meeting at Burton Town Hall was described as fractious by many members, and some questioned whether the meeting was biased towards Mr Griffiths. The chair of the local Conservative association, Conor Wileman, said tonight he would not be able to campaign for Andrew Griffiths if he was selected. Andrew Griffiths was exposed in a Sunday newspaper as having sent 2,000 texts to two female constituents, many of them of a sexual nature. He says he's since received mental health treatment. He was cleared of wrongdoing by the parliamentary standards watchdog.The watchdog saidit found no evidence he sent them while he would have been engaged in parliamentary activities. Mr Griffiths left the meeting through a back door and did not comment publicly. Many BBC outlets will be broadcasting from Bishop Auckland in Country Durham tomorrow as we put the focus on a constituency where a big Labour majority of more than 20,000 has been steadily chipped away over the last six elections, so it is now regarded as a marginal seat. Labour's majority at the last election was just 502. Our radio colleague Adrian Goldberg is already busily touting for customers. Allow Twitter content?

The first of tomorrow's newspaper front pages has arrived and its top story is on the big election news of today: Nigel Farage's withdrawing of hundreds of candidates from Tory-held seats. The Financial Times calls it a ""humbling
moment"" for Mr Farage. At the weekend, a spending row broke out after the Conservatives claimed they had added up Labour's policies and estimated they would cost Â£1.2tn over the course of the next five years. Chris Morris, from the BBC's fact-checking team Reality Check, says the figure the Tories came out with over the weekend is ""basically a fag packet calculation"" - although ""quite a big fag packet"" as their estimation is more than 30 pages long. But there's a few problems with the way they've come up with the figure, he tells the BBC's Electioncast. Watch him explain more here: Allow Twitter content?

No prosecutions over Sheku Bayoh death,"Sheku Bayoh died in 2015 after being restrained by police in Kirkcaldy The family of a Fife man who died in police custody said they felt ""betrayed"" after being told that no-one will be prosecuted over his death. Sheku Bayoh never regained consciousness after being restrained by officers in a Kirkcaldy street in 2015. The 31-year-old, who had taken the drugs MDMA and Flakka, was found to have suffered 23 separate injuries. His family said CCTV and phone footage cast doubt on claims made by officers about events leading up to his death. They have described the decision not to prosecute the officers as a ""betrayal of justice"" and are now calling for a public inquiry. The Crown Office said the decision not to prosecute had been taken after a ""thorough review"" of all the available evidence. The officers involved have always denied any wrongdoing. Sheku Bayoh police officers will be allowed to retire Sheku Bayoh: Fresh questions over death in police custody Sheku Bayoh's family 'devastated' over no charges Mr Bayoh's family had initially been told in October 2018 that no criminal charges would be brought over his death. However, two months laterevidence uncovered by BBC Scotlandraised fresh questions about the way he had been treated by police officers before he died in their custody. CCTV, other footage and documents obtained by the BBC previously casts doubt on some of the officers' accounts of the events that led to Mr Bayoh's death. TheDisclosureinvestigation included evidence that the first officers on scene escalated the situation instead of trying to defuse it, and other evidence that Mr Bayoh's actions were exaggerated in official police documents. A review of the decision not to prosecute the officers has been carried out. This video can not be played The BBC Disclosure programme featured previously unseen footage Mr Bayoh's family met Crown Office officials on Monday, when they were told that prosecutors would not be pursuing criminal charges in the case.Â Aamer Anwar, the family's lawyer, said they felt ""totally betrayed"" by Lord Advocate James Wolffe. Mr Anwar said the decision was a ""betrayal of justice"" and a ""failure to act in the public interest"". He said: ""Neither the family or the legal team accept the Crown's reasoning for no criminal charges. ""The Lord Advocate has presided over a four-and-a-half year investigation which was deeply flawed from the moment Sheku lost his life."" Aamer Anwar and the Bayoh family met Crown Office officials on Monday Either a fatal accident inquiry (FAI) or a public inquiry will now be held into Mr Bayoh's death. Mr Anwar said the family was formally requesting that the Scottish government consider holding a public inquiry, and would accept ""nothing less"". He added: ""The family do not have the trust or belief that a fatal accident inquiry (FAI) under the control of the Lord Advocate would have the remit or the courage to deal with serious public concerns, the wider issues of deaths in custody, use of restraint techniques, allegations of racism, lack of police accountability and the insufficient powers of the PIRC, nor will the findings of an FAI be binding on Police Scotland."" Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf said: ""I note the independent decision of the Lord Advocate in relation to this case and my thoughts remain with the family and friends of Mr Bayoh. ""As I have said previously, I am not ruling out the possibility of a public inquiry and that remains an option. I also made clear that I would first meet Mr Bayoh's family. I, and the First Minister, will do this tomorrow and I will update Parliament following that."" A Crown Office spokesman said: ""Following careful consideration and thorough review of all the available evidence, including submissions made on behalf of the family of the deceased, independent Crown Counsel has concluded there should not be a prosecution in this case. ""Although the evidence currently available would not justify criminal proceedings, the Crown reserves the right to prosecute should evidence in support of that become available."" David Kennedy, the deputy general secretary of the Scottish Police Federation, said: ""We continue to support the officers involved in this incident and hope that any public or fatal accident inquiry follows as soon as possible for all the parties involved.""

Man who lit fireworks at Remembrance event jailed,"Stuart Potts claimed he set off the fireworks to emulate the volley of shots fired at some Remembrance Day events A man who admitted ruining a Remembrance Sunday event by setting off fireworks during a two-minute silence has been jailed for 16 weeks. Stuart Potts, 38, let off two fireworks as hundreds of people observed the silence at 11:00 GMT at the cenotaph in Eccles, Salford, on Sunday. Potts set off the fireworks while sitting on a ledge of a first-floor window in a nearby disused pub. He admitted throwing a firework in public, and a public order offence. Potts of Borough Road, Salford, who has 21 previous convictions, claimed he was given the fireworks by someone else and lit them ""as a mark of respect"" to emulate the volley of shots fired at some Remembrance Day events. Sentencing him at Manchester Magistrates' Court, District Judge Mark Hadfield said he did not believe Potts' story. He added: ""I rather doubt that anybody in their right mind would think letting them off in the middle of that ceremony was a mark of respect. ""It shows a staggering lack of respect for those attending and those being remembered."" This video can not be played Angry veterans shouted ""Get him out!"" before officers took a man away in a police car The fireworks exploded above the cenotaph as the Last Post ended. Beth Pilling, prosecuting, told the court the first resulted in loud bangs, and the second - a rocket - flew above the heads of the crowd gathered at the service. The court heard a crowd of angry veterans gathered outside the pub window in Church Street shouting, ""Get him out!"" and tried to break the door of the pub down, while others attempted to climb up to the window. When Potts appeared at the window to remonstrate with the crowd, a number of traffic cones were thrown at him before he was arrested.

Man 'broke neck during chiropractor treatment',"John Lawler died following treatment at the Chiropractic 1st clinic in York A man whose neck broke as he was treated by a chiropractor shouted ""You are hurting me,"" his widow told an inquest. John Lawler, 80, was attending Chiropractic 1st in York in August 2017 when he said he could not feel his arms and became like a ""ragdoll"". Mr Lawler was taken to York Hospital and later transferred to Leeds General Infirmary where he died the next day. A police investigation into his death ruled out any criminal charges. Giving evidence, Joan Lawler, said her husband had been a fit and healthy man. They had booked a series of chiropractic treatments after an initial assessment with Arleen Scholten. ""She said his shoulders and back were out of line and by gentle manipulation she could make his life much happier,"" Mrs Lawler said. The first two appointments went well and they returned for a third appointment on Friday 11 August, , Mrs Lawler added. Paramedics were called to Chiropractic 1st in York when Mr Lawler became unwell ""She started on the shoulders and went round his body.... Then the table dropped and he shouted 'You're hurting me. You are hurting me. I can't feel my arms,'"" Mrs Lawler told the inquest. She said Mrs Scholten carried on treating her husband for a moment but then realised he was unresponsive and asked him to turn over. He did not respond and the chiropractor manoeuvred him into a chair. ""She got John on to the chair but he was like a ragdoll,"" Mrs Lawler said. ""He wasn't moving and he wasn't speaking."" She said when paramedics arrived Mrs Scholten did not inform them of the table drop element during the treatment only that she had been applying ""gentle manipulation"". He was initially taken to York Hospital where the family was told he had a broken neck. ""They said unfortunately John was a paraplegic and needed to be moved to a special unit,"" Mrs Lawler said. The following day, at Leeds General Infirmary, she was told Mr Lawler had a broken neck and would need a 14-hour operation to install a neck brace. It would be a traumatic operation and they were told it ""might kill him anyway"", she said. She said during this discussion her husband made some mumbling noises. ""We decided he was saying no [to the operation],"" she said. ""There was nothing they could do. He lay there and just faded away,"" she added. The inquest continues.

Ex-Tory MP: Johnson vs Corbyn 'appalling choice',"Nick Boles quit the Tories over their position on Brexit in March A former Tory MP has condemned the ""appalling choice"" voters face between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn. In a scathing attack in the Evening Standard,external, Nick Boles accused Mr Johnson of being a ""compulsive liar"" and called Mr Corbyn a ""totalitarian"". Mr Boles -who quit the Tories over their stance on Brexit- also revealed he would vote Liberal Democrat. He said it would ""not entail the kind of moral compromise"" of voting Tory or Labour in 12 December's election. BBC News has contacted the Conservatives and Labour for a response. Mr Boles urged people to vote for ""whichever party is best-placed to challenge"" the two largest parties in Westminster. Last week, former Labour MP Ian Austin saidhe would be voting Conservativeas Mr Corbyn was ""completely unfit to lead our country"". Trust is the burning issue at this election Ex-Tory MP hits out at 'cowardly' cabinet LIVE: Farage move and Lib Dem debate challenge In his article, Mr Boles said the 12 December poll would be ""the only election in modern times in which you wouldn't trust either of the prime ministerial candidates to mind your children for an hour, let alone run the country"". The former MP, who used to work for Mr Johnson when he was Mayor of London, made a number of personal attacks about his old boss' honesty. He also accused the PM of ""turning the party of Disraeli and Churchill into a vehicle for shrill English nationalism"", and said Mr Johnson had ""purged its ranks of anyone who favours a close relationship with our European partners"". Turning his fire on Mr Corbyn, Mr Boles said: ""Like all leaders of a totalitarian mindset, he is entirely uninterested in the lives of individual human beings. ""He cares only for classes and factions, and the struggle between abstract political forces."" Mr Boles said voters ""will not remake Britain's political system in one day"", but could make a start by voting for his former political rivals, the Liberal Democrats. ""I will vote for Jo Swinson's candidate because it will not entail the kind of moral compromise that voting Conservative or Labour would,"" he added. ""I trust her to pursue the closest possible relationship with the European Union after Brexit. ""And, most of all, because the Liberal Democrats will insist on electoral reform and the introduction of a proportional voting system, which is essential if we are ever to break free of the tyranny of the two big parties and open up British politics to new forces, new faces and new ideas."" This video can not be played Nick Boles dramatically quit his party during a speech in the Commons in March 2019 Mr Boles was part of a cross-party group of MPs who tried to find a compromise in Parliament back in March around a Brexit proposal that would retain access to the single market. After his ""Common Market 2.0"" plan was rejected by MPs for the second time, he accused his party of ""failing to compromise"", saying he could no longer represent them in the Commons and would sit as an independent. He has decided not to stand at the upcoming election.

I came into the living room and the whole, front window had been blew out."" The father said that they were sitting behind the door at the time and if somebody was beside the door they could have been blown ""out the window with it"". The plastic casing scarred the top of the wood burner as it melted, then exploded The two children, along with their mother, were upstairs when the explosion happened. They had left the living room minutes beforehand. As they all ran downstairs to see what had happened, the mother fell down the stairs, suffering a pelvic injury. ""It blew open the door, but this is the amazing thing - there's not a pick of damage in the living room,"" said the father. ""There's mirrors, there's pictures, there's lamps, TV - not one bit of damage.  Just the windows have been blown out.  I just can't get my head around it."" The front window was blown out during the explosion He added: ""My gas box is in the living room. ""How that didn't explode - we just have to thank our lucky stars."" The Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service has urged people to be vigilant and always store any aerosol canisters away from any naked flames or heat.

Pressure had been growing on Mr Morales since his narrow victory in last month's presidential election. On Sunday, events moved swiftly. First, the Organization of American States, a regional body, announced its audit of the election had found ""clear manipulation"" and called for the result to be annulled. In response, Mr Morales agreed to hold fresh elections. But his main rival, Carlos Mesa - who came second in the vote - said Mr Morales should not stand in any new vote. What really seemed to tip the balance was the intervention of the chief of the armed forces, Gen Williams Kaliman, who urged Mr Morales to step down in the interests of peace and stability.

Man who lit fireworks at Remembrance event jailedPyrotechnics went off above a war memorial as hundreds of people observed the two-minute silence.Manchester,"Stuart Potts claimed he set off the fireworks to emulate the volley of shots fired at some Remembrance Day events A man who admitted ruining a Remembrance Sunday event by setting off fireworks during a two-minute silence has been jailed for 16 weeks. Stuart Potts, 38, let off two fireworks as hundreds of people observed the silence at 11:00 GMT at the cenotaph in Eccles, Salford, on Sunday. Potts set off the fireworks while sitting on a ledge of a first-floor window in a nearby disused pub. He admitted throwing a firework in public, and a public order offence. Potts of Borough Road, Salford, who has 21 previous convictions, claimed he was given the fireworks by someone else and lit them ""as a mark of respect"" to emulate the volley of shots fired at some Remembrance Day events. Sentencing him at Manchester Magistrates' Court, District Judge Mark Hadfield said he did not believe Potts' story. He added: ""I rather doubt that anybody in their right mind would think letting them off in the middle of that ceremony was a mark of respect. ""It shows a staggering lack of respect for those attending and those being remembered."" This video can not be played Angry veterans shouted ""Get him out!"" before officers took a man away in a police car The fireworks exploded above the cenotaph as the Last Post ended. Beth Pilling, prosecuting, told the court the first resulted in loud bangs, and the second - a rocket - flew above the heads of the crowd gathered at the service. The court heard a crowd of angry veterans gathered outside the pub window in Church Street shouting, ""Get him out!"" and tried to break the door of the pub down, while others attempted to climb up to the window. When Potts appeared at the window to remonstrate with the crowd, a number of traffic cones were thrown at him before he was arrested. Fireworks exploded as the Last Post ended and hundreds of people were observing a two-minute silence The court heard a statement from an ex-Royal Marine who was at the event to place a cross on the cenotaph for a fallen comrade.

"Bird of prey 'grabs' Chihuahua in gardenThe dog's owners managed to prevent the bird flying off with their pet in Aberdeen.NE Scotland, Orkney & Shetland","Emma the dog is now recovering A pet Chihuahua had a ""very lucky"" escape when a bird of prey tried to snatch it, according to its owners. Sheila Gillanders, 72, said 18-month-old Emma was only saved thanks to the quick actions of her husband Robert. The buzzard-like bird tried to take the pet from their garden in Aberdeen's Stoneywood on Friday. But Mr Gillanders, 65, managed to get to the predator and release the dog from its talons. Emma is now recovering at home after being treated by a vet. Mrs Gillanders said: ""We heard a bell and it was a bird of prey coming down - it must have escaped from its handler."" Seagull 'flew off with Gizmo the Chihuahua' She explained: ""It pinned her against the fence. It only got so far up, but my husband was able to get the bird off her. ""It then just looked at us. It was a really big bird, like a buzzard. It was definitely trained, as it was wearing a bell."" Emma was taken to the vet, and is receiving medication. Mrs Gillanders hopes the appeal will lead to the bird's handler to come forward. Her owner added: ""She is a bit bruised but otherwise she was not physically injured. ""Her stress is sky-high and we are struggling to get her back out in the garden. ""It was very lucky. If it had not been for my husband getting to her so quickly I dread to think what could have happened.""

Medieval wall collapses on house and gardenAbout 600 tonnes of stonework and other material toppled in the wall collapse at Lewes Castle.,"This video can not be played A section Lewes Castle's boundary wall has collapsed onto a neighbouring house A medieval castle's 600-tonne wall collapsed on to a house and garden in Lewes sparking a major search. Emergency services, including a hazardous area response team and sniffer dogs, went to the scene of the collapse of the 10m (32ft) by 10m wall. When the alert first came in at 12:22 GMT, it was not known if anyone was trapped and dogs trained for use in earthquake zones were deployed. Firefighters later tweeted the search was over with no casualties found. Incident commander Matt Lloyd said the wall had fallen into an adjacent garden and house. The wall formed part of the defences of the 1,000-year-old castle The wall had been reportedly undergoing work to remove ivy in recent weeks. A spokeswoman for castle owners Sussex Archaeological Society said the wall that collapsed was privately-owned and the section that had fallen was part of the curtain wall that ran round the entire outside of the 1,000-year-old landmark. The castle was privately owned and used as a folly before it was given to the archaeological society It was one of the last remaining sections of the historic defence wall, she said, adding: ""There's not much of it left standing.

Fears for flood-hit village as more rain due,"One villager said Fishlake ""has not been flooded for 100 years"" Residents of a heavily flooded village in Yorkshire fear conditions could get worse as more rain is forecast. The Environment Agency has 39 flood warnings in place across the country, including five severe warnings on the River Don in South Yorkshire. About 400 homes have been flooded in the North, and 1,200 properties have been evacuated, the agency said. Boris Johnson has called a meeting to discuss the government's response after criticism from Jeremy Corbyn. Doncaster Council has called for people to evacuate the village of Fishlake, near Doncaster, saying it ""can only offer dedicated support to people who are not in an area where there is a threat to life"". But farmers say they are unable to leave as they need to care for their livestock. Community rallies to help flood-hit villagers A yellow warning for rain remains in place over parts of Yorkshire and the East Midlands for Monday, Tuesday and Thursday. An emergency appeal to support ""displaced"" families has raised almost Â£50,000. Four Environment Agency pumps are now in operation in Fishlake to pump out floodwater from the village. Doncaster Council said it is ""still an emergency situation"" with five areas in the borough under a severe flood warning, meaning a ""significant risk to life"". The authority said the previous evacuation advice still stands for all areas. Twelve flood warnings remain in Lincolnshire where more than 1,000 acres have been flooded by Barlings Eau and some farms are cut off. This video can not be played A Lincolnshire farmer cut off by floodwater talks about his frustrations Jeremy Corbyn has written to Prime Minister Boris Johnson urging him to take greater action over the flooding and criticising him for not declaring a national emergency. ""If this had happened in Surrey, not Yorkshire or the East Midlands, it seems far more likely that a national emergency would have been declared,"" he said. The prime minister said he will chair an emergency Cobra meeting on Tuesday to discuss the government's response to the flooding. Pam Webb said she was devastated by the impact of the floods Pam Webb, who owns a spa in Fishlake, said she bought her property in 2004 and had surveys done at the time. ""There was nothing of any concern raised, Fishlake hadn't flooded in 100 years,"" she said. ""We need to now establish why and how and who should be accountable. ""Is it the flood defences that weren't sufficient to hold it? Did something give at some other point?"" A funeral parlour in Fishlake was hit by flooding Ms Webb said she had just found out her insurance would not cover the damage because of a flood exemption on the policy. ""It's my home and my business,"" she said. ""I work with a great team of girls and that's their livelihoods affected and my own as well."" The village church is collecting food to distribute to residents and roast dinners were delivered on Sunday to those who had remained in their homes. Empty coffins were seen floating inside the workshop of a flooded funeral parlour in the village. Farmer Robert Robinson called for the River Don to be dredged Tractors and boats have been used to get around the village, with many roadsin the area under floodwater. Military helicoptershave been used,externalto help boost flood defences in the area. The Environment Agency called in an RAF Chinook late on Sunday to move 40 tonnes of aggregate from a quarry to bolster drainage channels east of Bentley Farmer Robert Robinson said: ""My whole farm is just covered in water. We've animals that are suffering because of the water and we can't get in and out without tractors. ""We desperately need the River Don to be dredged and cleaned out, it's there to transport water and it's not doing its job properly."" Stephen Gilleard, another farmer from the village, said: ""You learn to live with nature and, as a farmer, you deal with things but you can't deal with this. ""There's a lot of volume of water here to move, we've still not got no pumps in place starting to get rid of any of it, it's a bad forecast for Thursday, more rain to come, and, unless we move some of this water, there's no room for any more."" Adrian Gill, a flood manager with the Environment Agency, said it did not currently dredge the River Don ""because we don't think that's the right thing to do"" but the situation could be reviewed in the future. A flooded field 100m from the River Don on the outskirts of Kirk Bramwith in South Yorkshire Many parts of Fishlake remain under 3ft (1m) of water Some train lines remain blocked by high water. Northern saidits services into Rotherham Central,externalwere not running until further notice, with reduced services between Doncaster and Sheffield. CrossCountry's trains are beingdiverted away from Doncaster,external. Doncaster Council saida number of roads,externalremained closed. According to the Salvation Army, some people have been rescued from their homes by boat since the early hours of Saturday, but others remain in their properties. Rescuers used boats to reach people trapped in Rotherham One woman said she had no insurance to cover the cost of damage to her home in Bentley, near Doncaster, after it flooded over the weekend. April Wingfield, who had to be rescued from her home by boat, said: ""I'm devastated, I'm just going to have to start from scratch."" She said the situation was worse than in 2007, when 2,200 properties were flooded across Sheffield withdamage estimated at Â£400min the Lower Don Valley alone. The RSPCA has been involved in a rescue operation to save 60 swans following an oil spillage caused by flooding in Rotherham. Further south, parts of Derbyshire are still affected by flooding. Areas around Matlock - where former High Sherriff of DerbyshireAnnie Hall was swept to her deathby the flooded River Derwent - are continuing their clean-up efforts, with further rain over the weekend leaving standing water along a number of roads.

Wales standards boss quits over AM's secret recordings,"Sir Roderick Evans became standards commissioner in 2017 The man who oversees complaints about politicians in Wales has resigned after he was secretly recorded by an assembly member. Standards commissioner Sir Roderick Evans said ""highly confidential conversations"" with his staff had been taped. The former Plaid Cymru AM Neil McEvoy has confirmed he made the recordings. Police are being asked to investigate and the assembly has arranged a sweep of the organisation's estate. The South Wales Central AM, who now sits as an independent, alleged he had found evidence that he claimed had brought Sir Roderick's office into disrepute. He said he had acted lawfully and in the public interest. He had been facing three separate investigations by the standards commissioner at the time, before Sir Roderick resigned. Sir Roderick, a former high court judge and pro-chancellor of Swansea University, said Mr McEvoy's actions were ""wholly unacceptable"" as he stood down on Monday. Sexism row over 'buxom barmaids' video Watchdog quits UKIP barmaid video probe Leanne Wood reprimanded for swearing on Twitter ""It has come to my attention that conversations with my staff about a variety of highly confidential and sensitive matters have been secretly, and possibly illegally, recorded over a period of what seems to be several months and in what seems to be a number of different locations by an assembly member,"" said Sir Roderick, who had served as the assembly's standards commissioner since 2017. ""These have included highly confidential conversations with my staff including references to cases brought by members of the public. ""That a member of our national assembly could behave in this way is wholly unacceptable. It undermines the integrity of the complaints procedure and brings our democratic process into disrepute. ""I'm not prepared to continue in my role as standards commissioner."" Neil McEvoy said he had acted lawfully in the public interest Welsh Assembly presiding officer Elin Jones said she had accepted Sir Roderick's resignation, and the process to find a successor will now begin. She said: ""Covert recording of private conversations is a serious matter and we will be asking South Wales Police to investigate how such recordings were obtained. ""Arrangements have been made for a sweep of the Senedd estate to locate any unauthorised electronic surveillance devices."" In response to Mr McEvoy, the standards commissioner's office said: ""The appropriateness of covert recordings of private and confidential conversations will be considered by the relevant authorities in due course."" Sir Roderick was embroiled in a row last year after he said a video featuring a Labour AM's face superimposed on a woman in a low-cut top was not sexist. Earlier in 2019 he was accused ofdouble standards after he recommended a Plaid Cymru AM Leanne Wood be reprimanded for a swear word in a tweet.

UK growth 'slowest in almost a decade',"Britain's economy has grown at the slowest annual rate in almost a decade, according to official figures. Year-on-year growth in the three months to end-September slowed to 1% from 1.3% in the second quarter, the Office for National Statistics said. An ONS spokesman said: ""Looking at the picture over the last year, growth slowed to its lowest rate in almost a decade."" But the economy avoided a recession by growing 0.3% in the third quarter. The economy had shrunk in the second quarter and two quarters of contraction would have signalled a recession. Despite the economy expanding by 0.3% in the third quarter, it was not as fast as the 0.4% forecast by economists, including at the Bank of England. A statistician at the ONS said GDP grew ""steadily"" in the third quarter. That was largely as a result of a ""strong July"". ""The underlying trade deficit narrowed, mainly due to growing exports of both goods and services."" In the month of September, GDP fell by 0.1%, as had been expected. But the ONS revised down the contraction in August to 0.2% from 0.1%. It was the growth of 0.3% in July that drove the economy in the whole of the third quarter. John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC, said: ""The fact that growth was positive in the third quarter was largely due to a strong July. ""Output then fell back in August and September, which points to a lack of momentum in the economy going into the fourth quarter."" The statistician at the ONS said: ""Services again led the way, with construction also performing well. ""Manufacturing failed to grow, as falls in many industries were offset by car production bouncing back following April shutdowns."" The ONS said the construction sector showed its first positive growth for a rolling three-month period since May. Production was flat in the three months to September and has not shown growth over a rolling three-month period since April. Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), said: ""The dominant services sector was the main driver of GDP growth in the quarter with industrial production and construction sectors adding little to overall UK GDP growth."" Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics, said that while the economy avoided a recession in the third quarter, the economy was ""pretty soft"". ""The GDP figures suggest that the economy failed to regain much momentum after the the second-quarter contraction."" Tej Parikh, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, said that ""a return to growth is welcome news, but narrowly avoiding a recession is nothing to celebrate"". ""The UK economy has been in stop-start mode all year, with growth punctuated by the various Brexit deadlines,"" he added. Ms Gregory added: ""While the election is just under five weeks away, clearly this isn't the good news the government might have hoped for."" The economyhad unexpectedly contracted by 0.2% in the second quarter- the March to June period - when Brexit stockpiles were unwound after the first Brexit date of 29 March. Samuel Tombs, economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said a ""renewed stockpiling boost"" failed to materalise in the third quarter. ""It possible that stockpiling occurred to a greater extent at the start of the fourth quarter,"" he said, adding fourth-quarter growth might not be depressed to the extent he expected. But Mr Parikh said that ""the final quarter of 2019 could be weaker as stockpiles continue to be run down"". The Chancellor, Sajid Javid, said there figures were ""another welcome sign that the fundamentals of the UK economy are strong. Under the conservatives, we've seen nine consecutive years of growth"". He added: ""What it also shows is the real risk to growth in our economy is Corbyn's Labour. If they get their way, two referendums in 2020, eye watering amounts of spending and borrowing and debt, that kind of economic vandalism will bring growth in this country to a halt."" But John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said: ""The fact that the government will be celebrating 0.1% growth in the last six months is a sign of how low their hopes and expectations for our economy are."" Ed Davey, the Liberal Democrat's deputy leader said: ""The economy under the Tories is anaemic."" As much as it would be a relief that a formal recession has been avoided, the picture is very sluggish, in keeping with what has been called a ""slow puncture"" economy. Growth of 0.3% between July and September is clearly preferable to another quarter of contraction, but still slow by normal historical standards. Indeed, comparing the third quarter this year with the same period last year, growth of just 1% is the slowest since the aftermath of the financial crisis. It is the weakest two quarters since the financial crisis. The background is a slower European and world economy reeling from trade wars. But years of damaged business investment, after the Brexit referendum, are taking their toll on growth. The latest figures in the month of September showed a contraction of 0.1%. Data has been volatile this year, with car industry shutdowns and two bouts of ultimately unneeded no-deal Brexit stockpiling.

Wales standards boss quits over AM's secret recordingsPolice are being asked to investigate but AM Neil McEvoy says he acted in the public interest.,"Sir Roderick Evans became standards commissioner in 2017 The man who oversees complaints about politicians in Wales has resigned after he was secretly recorded by an assembly member. Standards commissioner Sir Roderick Evans said ""highly confidential conversations"" with his staff had been taped. The former Plaid Cymru AM Neil McEvoy has confirmed he made the recordings. Police are being asked to investigate and the assembly has arranged a sweep of the organisation's estate. The South Wales Central AM, who now sits as an independent, alleged he had found evidence that he claimed had brought Sir Roderick's office into disrepute. He said he had acted lawfully and in the public interest. He had been facing three separate investigations by the standards commissioner at the time, before Sir Roderick resigned. Sir Roderick, a former high court judge and pro-chancellor of Swansea University, said Mr McEvoy's actions were ""wholly unacceptable"" as he stood down on Monday. Sexism row over 'buxom barmaids' video Watchdog quits UKIP barmaid video probe Leanne Wood reprimanded for swearing on Twitter ""It has come to my attention that conversations with my staff about a variety of highly confidential and sensitive matters have been secretly, and possibly illegally, recorded over a period of what seems to be several months and in what seems to be a number of different locations by an assembly member,"" said Sir Roderick, who had served as the assembly's standards commissioner since 2017. ""These have included highly confidential conversations with my staff including references to cases brought by members of the public. ""That a member of our national assembly could behave in this way is wholly unacceptable. It undermines the integrity of the complaints procedure and brings our democratic process into disrepute. ""I'm not prepared to continue in my role as standards commissioner."" Neil McEvoy said he had acted lawfully in the public interest Welsh Assembly presiding officer Elin Jones said she had accepted Sir Roderick's resignation, and the process to find a successor will now begin. She said: ""Covert recording of private conversations is a serious matter and we will be asking South Wales Police to investigate how such recordings were obtained. ""Arrangements have been made for a sweep of the Senedd estate to locate any unauthorised electronic surveillance devices."" In response to Mr McEvoy, the standards commissioner's office said: ""The appropriateness of covert recordings of private and confidential conversations will be considered by the relevant authorities in due course."" Sir Roderick was embroiled in a row last year after he said a video featuring a Labour AM's face superimposed on a woman in a low-cut top was not sexist. Earlier in 2019 he was accused ofdouble standards after he recommended a Plaid Cymru AM Leanne Wood be reprimanded for a swear word in a tweet.

White Helmets co-founder discovered dead in Turkey,"James Le Mesurier received an OBE for his work with White Helmet volunteers in Syria A former British Army officer honoured by the Queen for his work with the White Helmets civil defence group in Syria has been found dead in Turkey. The body of James Le Mesurier, who received an OBE in 2016, was discovered on Monday near his home in Istanbul, White Helmet sources told the BBC. Mr Le Mesurier set up the Mayday Rescue emergency response group, which helped train White Helmets volunteers. The cause of death is not known. Turkey has launched an investigation. UK rehomes Syria White Helmet volunteers Why is there a war in Syria? In a tweet, the White Helmets saidthe group had ""learned with shock and sadness the news"" of the death of Mr Le Mesurier.,external Hamish de Bretton-Gordon, a director of the Doctors Under Fire campaign group and a friend of Mr Le Mesurier, said: ""It's absolutely tragic. He was one of the few people who have made a humanitarian footprint in Syria."" Mr de Bretton-Gordon said the White Helmets had a very ""strong structure"" and their work would continue. But he said Mr Le Mesurier's death had left a ""hole to fill"". Mr Le Mesurier's body was found at about 04:30 local time (01:30 GMT) on the street near his home and office in Istanbul's Beyoglu district on the European side of the city. He was found with fractures to his head and legs, Turkish media say, and is believed to have fallen from his balcony. The entrance of the home reportedly belonging to Mr Le Mesurier was sealed A ""comprehensive"" investigation has been launched, the Istanbul governor's office says. Mr Le Mesurier, who was believed to be in his 40s at the time of his death and had also worked for the United Nations, was considered a co-founder of the White Helmets. The organisation, which is also known as the Syria Civil Defence, helps rescue civilians caught up in attacks in areas of Syria controlled by the opposition to President Bashar al-Assad. The White Helmets describe themselves as a volunteer workforce acting to save people in Syria's war zones In 2016, the organisation received the Right Livelihood Award in recognition for ""outstanding bravery, compassion and humanitarian engagement in rescuing civilians"". Later the same year the group was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. But the Syrian government and its allies Russia and Iran have accused the White Helmets of openly aiding terrorist organisations and the Russian foreign ministry last week accused Mr Le Mesurier of being a former agent of the UK's Secret Intelligence Service, better known as MI6.

Girl's theme park ride death 'accidental',"Evha Jannath fell out of a circular boat on the Splash Canyon attraction A girl who drowned when she fell from a theme park ride while on a school trip died accidentally, an inquest jury has concluded. Evha Jannathwas unsupervised on the Splash Canyon ride at Drayton Manorin Tamworth, Staffordshire, when she died on 9 May 2017. The 11-year-old from Leicester, who could not swim, fell from a boat when it hit a barrier. The ride has been closed since, Stafford Coroner's Court heard. Evha, who was on an end-of-year school trip with Jameah Girls Academy, was pronounced dead in hospital later the same day. Latest news from the West Midlands The inquest was told she had been standing up and ""reaching into the water"", breaching the park's rules, before she was ""propelled"" from the boat. CCTV footage played to jurors, showed her wading back towards her friends before climbing an ""algae-covered travelator"" and then falling off into a ""much deeper"" section of water. She was spotted face down by staff about 11 minutes later before her lifeless body was retrieved. Jurors were told the emergency stop button for the rapids ride was not pressed for 10 minutes after staff were informed a child was in the water. The inquest had heard Evha fell during her second turn on the ride - on her first she had been accompanied by teachers. The Splash Canyon ride has remained closed since Evha's death Police told the hearing a member of school staff, who had been assigned to accompany pupils, waited by the exit with another child who had not wanted to board the ride. Head teacher Erfana Bora said the teacher acted in line with the school's health and safety policy on the day. Ride operator Samuel Read said half the ride was not covered by CCTV cameras. Changes to add more had not yet been brought in. The theme park told assistant coroner Margaret Jones the ride would not reopen ""in the current format"" and until it had the consent of the Health and Safety Executive. Returning their conclusion, the jury panel said monitoring of CCTV ""did not identify any misbehaviour"" and there was ""no opportunity"" to rewind the footage. ""The sign at the entrance for the ride does not tell passengers to sit."" they said, but the sign did say the ride was ""bumpy"" and there were ""11 worded signs which instructed guests to remain seated and hold the centre ring."" The coroner said she will write to all UK theme parks urging them to conduct CCTV training. In a statement, Evha's famly said: ""We have been very upset to learn that Drayton Manor had no life-saving equipment on the ride and no one knew how to rescue Evha. ""We would like to thank the coroner for the recommendations she is making as to the safety of this and similar rides in the hope that no other family will have to go through what we have had to endure. ""Evha was a bright and happy young girl who had great hopes for the future. Sadly, we will not be able to see her realise her dreams."" In a statement, the theme park said: ""We would like to express our deep, deep regret for the loss of Evha in what was a tragic accident. ""Our thoughts have remained with her family, friends and everyone affected since that day."" The Jameah Girls Academy said the inquest had ""given us some insight into the circumstances by which she so sadly lost her life."" Its statement added: ""Our hearts go out to Evha's family, and we hope that this inquest has given them some closure. ""As a school we will continue to honour Evha's memory.""

"Chip shop owner 'killed wife with boiling oil'Geoffrey Bran denies murdering Mavis Bran, who suffered ""terrible burns"" at the couple's chip shop.Wales","Geoffrey Bran is on trial at Swansea Crown Court A fish and chip shop owner killed his wife by ""throwing boiling oil"" over her, a court has heard. Geoffrey Bran, 71, denies murdering Mavis Bran, 69, in Hermon, Carmarthenshire, in October 2018. Mrs Bran died in Swansea's Morriston Hospital, six days after suffering burns at The Chipoteria. Swansea Crown Court heard Mrs Bran rang a friend after having scalding oil thrown at her, pleading with her to come and help. Mr and Mrs Bran, who had been married for 30 years, opened the chip shop in a wooden cabin in January 2018 - one of a number of small businesses they owned. Mavis Bran died six days after sustaining severe burns at the chip shop she ran In the months leading up to her death, Mrs Bran's friend Caroline Morgan noticed the couple's relationship was seemingly deteriorating, the court heard, with Mr Bran appearing withdrawn and his wife expressing concerns about his health. She had told Ms Morgan she was ""frightened of the defendant and afraid he was going to kill her"". In a phone call at about 13:15 BST on 23 October last year, Mrs Bran told Ms Morgan: ""Caroline, please help me, please, emergency, emergency, please get here. Geoff has thrown boiling oilÂ over me,"" the jury was told. Ms Morgan drove to the shop and told a lodger at the nearby house, Gareth Davies, to phone an ambulance. Geoffrey Bran denies killing his wife Mr Bran told Mr Davies and Ms Morgan there had been an accident and Mrs Bran had slipped and pulled the fryer over herself. Mr Davies told Mr Bran his wife's ""skin was coming off her"", but Mr Bran did not follow him to a neighbour's house where Mrs Bran had fled for help. He asked Ms Morgan to cook some fish for new customers, but she told him to shut the shop. Prosecutor Paul Lewis QC told the court: ""It appears that financial pressures of their various businesses would at times put a strain on their relationship and they would sometimes argue about money. ""They are described by people who knew them as a couple who both had shortÂ tempers, and who have 'always argued, swearing and shouting at each other'. ""It is the prosecution case that the terrible burns that Mrs Bran suffered were not the result of an accident, butÂ were causedÂ by her husband deliberately pushing or throwing over her a deep fat fryer which contained scalding oil."" Mrs Bran was taken by air ambulance to the burns unit at Morriston Hospital in Swansea, where doctors found she had suffered burns to 46% of her body. After being ventilated, she was unable to tell police what happened, the court heard. Paramedic Alison Williams said that when they asked Mrs Bran what happened, she told them: ""My husband threw the hot fat over me"". The couple ran The Chipoteria in Carmarthenshire, one of a number of businesses they owned Ms Williams said she heard Mrs Bran say: ""Go and get him so that he can see the state of me and see what he has done."" She later developed sepsis and hypothermia and underwent surgery to remove some of her burned skin but died from multi-organ failure at the hospital six days after the alleged attack. Mr Bran was initially arrested on suspicion of assault and denied attacking his wife, telling police: ""She got burned with the chip fryer. She slipped and it came off the top and went over her. Don't ask."" A nurse found he had a superficial cut to the front of his head and to the front of his neck, as well as a scuff abrasion to his right forearm. He later said in an interview his wife had become ""upset and agitated"" because a fryer in their van was dirty and she became angry at him because four fish had been spoiled, before adding: ""She can lose all reason."" The accused said his wife threw the spoiled fish in a temper, causing hot fat to fly through the air which led to her pulling the fryer unit down on top of herself. Mr Bran was re-arrested on suspicion of murder on 22 November last year.

"Ex-Tory MP: Johnson vs Corbyn 'appalling choice'Nick Boles says the PM is a ""compulsive liar"" and calls the Labour leader a ""totalitarian"".UK Politics","Nick Boles quit the Tories over their position on Brexit in March A former Tory MP has condemned the ""appalling choice"" voters face between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn. In a scathing attack in the Evening Standard,external, Nick Boles accused Mr Johnson of being a ""compulsive liar"" and called Mr Corbyn a ""totalitarian"". Mr Boles -who quit the Tories over their stance on Brexit- also revealed he would vote Liberal Democrat. He said it would ""not entail the kind of moral compromise"" of voting Tory or Labour in 12 December's election. BBC News has contacted the Conservatives and Labour for a response. Mr Boles urged people to vote for ""whichever party is best-placed to challenge"" the two largest parties in Westminster. Last week, former Labour MP Ian Austin saidhe would be voting Conservativeas Mr Corbyn was ""completely unfit to lead our country"". Trust is the burning issue at this election Ex-Tory MP hits out at 'cowardly' cabinet LIVE: Farage move and Lib Dem debate challenge In his article, Mr Boles said the 12 December poll would be ""the only election in modern times in which you wouldn't trust either of the prime ministerial candidates to mind your children for an hour, let alone run the country"". The former MP, who used to work for Mr Johnson when he was Mayor of London, made a number of personal attacks about his old boss' honesty. He also accused the PM of ""turning the party of Disraeli and Churchill into a vehicle for shrill English nationalism"", and said Mr Johnson had ""purged its ranks of anyone who favours a close relationship with our European partners"". Turning his fire on Mr Corbyn, Mr Boles said: ""Like all leaders of a totalitarian mindset, he is entirely uninterested in the lives of individual human beings. ""He cares only for classes and factions, and the struggle between abstract political forces."" Mr Boles said voters ""will not remake Britain's political system in one day"", but could make a start by voting for his former political rivals, the Liberal Democrats. ""I will vote for Jo Swinson's candidate because it will not entail the kind of moral compromise that voting Conservative or Labour would,"" he added. ""I trust her to pursue the closest possible relationship with the European Union after Brexit. ""And, most of all, because the Liberal Democrats will insist on electoral reform and the introduction of a proportional voting system, which is essential if we are ever to break free of the tyranny of the two big parties and open up British politics to new forces, new faces and new ideas."" This video can not be played Nick Boles dramatically quit his party during a speech in the Commons in March 2019 Mr Boles was part of a cross-party group of MPs who tried to find a compromise in Parliament back in March around a Brexit proposal that would retain access to the single market. After his ""Common Market 2.0"" plan was rejected by MPs for the second time, he accused his party of ""failing to compromise"", saying he could no longer represent them in the Commons and would sit as an independent.

Scottish gallery to pull BP Portrait exhibition,"This year's winner - Imara in her Winter Coat by Charlie Schaffer The Scottish National Portrait Gallery in Edinburgh has said it will no longer show the BP Portrait Award exhibition. ""We recognise the need to do all we can to address the climate emergency,"" National Galleries Scotland said. The prize is run by London's National Portrait Gallery and has been sponsored by the oil giant for 30 years. An annual exhibition of the entries has toured to Edinburgh for a decade, but this year's show, which opens there on 7 December, will be the last to do so. BP has faced growing criticism over environmental issues in recent years. National Galleries Scotland acknowledged that ""for many people, the association of this competition with BP is seen as being at odds"" with its aim to help tackle climate change. ""Therefore, after due consideration, the trustees of the National Galleries of Scotland have decided that this will be the last time that the galleries will host this exhibition in its present form,"" it continued. ""The exhibition has been extremely popular with new and existing visitors over the years. We are grateful to the National Portrait Gallery in London and to BP for the opportunity that the competition and exhibition has provided to inspire young talent and to promote portrait artists from around the world."" This year's exhibition was on show at the National Portrait Gallery in London until last month and is also due to visit the Ulster Museum in Belfast. Brighton-based artist Charlie Schaffer won this year's Â£35,000 first prize for his portrait Imara In Her Winter Coat, of his close friend wearing a fake fur coat. But the award was overshadowed somewhat by the row over BP's continued sponsorship. Before the ceremony,judge Gary Hume saidthe company's involvement ""was now a problem"". In response, the National Portrait Gallery said BP's support ""enables free admission for the public"". The London venue said: ""We respect the National Galleries of Scotland's decision and we are grateful for all the support they've given to the award over the years."" The gallery also said it was considering options for its annual competitionswhen it closes for a three-year refurbishmentnext summer. A BP spokesperson said: ""The increasing polarisation of debate and attempts to exclude companies committed to being a part of the energy transition is exactly what is not needed."" Last month,the Royal Shakespeare Company decidedto end its partnership with BP after school students threatened a boycott. Follow us onFacebook,external, or on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external.

Sheila Gillanders, 72, said 18-month-old Emma was only saved thanks to the quick actions of her husband Robert. The buzzard-like bird tried to take the pet from their garden in Aberdeen's Stoneywood on Friday. But Mr Gillanders, 65, managed to get to the predator and release the dog from its talons. Emma is now recovering at home after being treated by a vet. Mrs Gillanders said: ""We heard a bell and it was a bird of prey coming down - it must have escaped from its handler."" Seagull 'flew off with Gizmo the Chihuahua' She explained: ""It pinned her against the fence. It only got so far up, but my husband was able to get the bird off her. ""It then just looked at us. It was a really big bird, like a buzzard. It was definitely trained, as it was wearing a bell."" Emma was taken to the vet, and is receiving medication. Mrs Gillanders hopes the appeal will lead to the bird's handler to come forward. Her owner added: ""She is a bit bruised but otherwise she was not physically injured. ""Her stress is sky-high and we are struggling to get her back out in the garden. ""It was very lucky. If it had not been for my husband getting to her so quickly I dread to think what could have happened.""

Chip shop owner 'killed wife with boiling oil',"Geoffrey Bran is on trial at Swansea Crown Court A fish and chip shop owner killed his wife by ""throwing boiling oil"" over her, a court has heard. Geoffrey Bran, 71, denies murdering Mavis Bran, 69, in Hermon, Carmarthenshire, in October 2018. Mrs Bran died in Swansea's Morriston Hospital, six days after suffering burns at The Chipoteria. Swansea Crown Court heard Mrs Bran rang a friend after having scalding oil thrown at her, pleading with her to come and help. Mr and Mrs Bran, who had been married for 30 years, opened the chip shop in a wooden cabin in January 2018 - one of a number of small businesses they owned. Mavis Bran died six days after sustaining severe burns at the chip shop she ran In the months leading up to her death, Mrs Bran's friend Caroline Morgan noticed the couple's relationship was seemingly deteriorating, the court heard, with Mr Bran appearing withdrawn and his wife expressing concerns about his health. She had told Ms Morgan she was ""frightened of the defendant and afraid he was going to kill her"". In a phone call at about 13:15 BST on 23 October last year, Mrs Bran told Ms Morgan: ""Caroline, please help me, please, emergency, emergency, please get here. Geoff has thrown boiling oilÂ over me,"" the jury was told. Ms Morgan drove to the shop and told a lodger at the nearby house, Gareth Davies, to phone an ambulance. Geoffrey Bran denies killing his wife Mr Bran told Mr Davies and Ms Morgan there had been an accident and Mrs Bran had slipped and pulled the fryer over herself. Mr Davies told Mr Bran his wife's ""skin was coming off her"", but Mr Bran did not follow him to a neighbour's house where Mrs Bran had fled for help. He asked Ms Morgan to cook some fish for new customers, but she told him to shut the shop. Prosecutor Paul Lewis QC told the court: ""It appears that financial pressures of their various businesses would at times put a strain on their relationship and they would sometimes argue about money. ""They are described by people who knew them as a couple who both had shortÂ tempers, and who have 'always argued, swearing and shouting at each other'. ""It is the prosecution case that the terrible burns that Mrs Bran suffered were not the result of an accident, butÂ were causedÂ by her husband deliberately pushing or throwing over her a deep fat fryer which contained scalding oil."" Mrs Bran was taken by air ambulance to the burns unit at Morriston Hospital in Swansea, where doctors found she had suffered burns to 46% of her body. After being ventilated, she was unable to tell police what happened, the court heard. Paramedic Alison Williams said that when they asked Mrs Bran what happened, she told them: ""My husband threw the hot fat over me"". The couple ran The Chipoteria in Carmarthenshire, one of a number of businesses they owned Ms Williams said she heard Mrs Bran say: ""Go and get him so that he can see the state of me and see what he has done."" She later developed sepsis and hypothermia and underwent surgery to remove some of her burned skin but died from multi-organ failure at the hospital six days after the alleged attack. Mr Bran was initially arrested on suspicion of assault and denied attacking his wife, telling police: ""She got burned with the chip fryer. She slipped and it came off the top and went over her. Don't ask."" A nurse found he had a superficial cut to the front of his head and to the front of his neck, as well as a scuff abrasion to his right forearm. He later said in an interview his wife had become ""upset and agitated"" because a fryer in their van was dirty and she became angry at him because four fish had been spoiled, before adding: ""She can lose all reason."" The accused said his wife threw the spoiled fish in a temper, causing hot fat to fly through the air which led to her pulling the fryer unit down on top of herself. Mr Bran was re-arrested on suspicion of murder on 22 November last year.

"Planet Mercury passes across the face of the SunAstronomers are observing a rare event, a transit of the planet Mercury.Science & Environment","Mercury appears in silhouette against the bright surface of the Sun Mercury has made a rare transit, where the planet passes across the face of the Sun as seen from Earth. During the transit, Mercury appeared as a dark silhouetted disc against the bright surface of our star. There are 14 transits in this century; the last before this was in 2016, but the next event will not occur until 2032. The transit began at 12:35 GMT, when the edge of Mercury appeared to touch the curvature of the Sun. Transits of Mercury are relatively rare (this image shows a previous, complete transit) It ended at 18:04 GMT when the edge of the silhouetted planet appeared to leave the Sun's disc. Professor Mike Cruise, president of the UK's Royal Astronomical Society (RAS), said: ""This is a rare event, and we'll have to wait 13 years until it happens again. Transits are a visible demonstration of how the planets move around the Sun."" The entire event was visible from the eastern US and Canada, the south-western tip of Greenland, most of the Caribbean, Central America, the whole of South America and some of West Africa. In Europe (including the UK), the Middle East, and most of Africa, the Sun set before the transit ended, and so the latter part of the event was not visible. In most of the US and Canada, and New Zealand, the transit was in progress as the Sun rose. Observers in eastern Asia, southern and south-eastern Asia, and Australia were not able to see the transit. Mercury is the smallest and innermost planet in the Solar System Mercury is the smallest and innermost planet in the Solar System. It completes each orbit around the Sun every 88 days, and passes between the Earth and Sun every 116 days. As the orbit of Mercury around the Sun is tilted compared with the orbit of the Earth around the Sun, the planet normally appears to pass above or below our nearest star. A transit can only take place when the Earth, Mercury and the Sun are exactly in line in three dimensions.

BA reviews 'fuel-tankering' over climate concerns,"British Airways has launched a review into a money-saving practice which increases its greenhouse gas emissions. It follows a BBC investigation exposing ""fuel tankering"" by airlines - in which planes are filled with extra fuel, usually to avoid paying higher prices for refuelling at destination airports. The industry-wide practice could mean extra annual emissions equivalent to those of a large European town. BA now says that using tankering to cut costs ""may be the wrong thing to do"". However, the airline added that it also uses the practice for safety and operational reasons, including helping planes to turn around quickly. BBC Panorama has discovered the airline's planes generated an extra 18,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide last year through fuel tankering. Cost savings made on a single flight can be as small as just over Â£10 - though savings can run to hundreds of pounds. Researchers have estimated that one in five of all European airlines' flights,externalinvolves some element of fuel tankering. The practice on European routes could result in additional annual greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to that produced by a town of 100,000 people. Critics say the widespread use of the practice undermines the aviation industry's claims that it is committed to reducing its carbon emissions. John Sauven, Greenpeace UK's executive director, told the BBC that fuel tankering was a ""classic example of a company putting profit before planet"". Responding to BA's decision to carry out a review, Mr Sauven, said it showed how the airline industry had been treating climate change ""like a PR problem"". ""This is why we need government-enforced reduction targets to ensure airlines take responsibility for the damage their emissions are causing,"" he said. John Sauven called for rules and regulations to be ""tougher"" International Airlines Group (IAG), the company that owns BA, says it wants to be the world's leading airline group on sustainability. BA boasts it even prints its in-flight magazine on lighter paper to save weight. Yet BBC Panorama has seen dozens of internal BA documents that show up to six tonnes of extra fuel have been loaded onto planes in this way. It has also seen evidence that Easyjet carries extra fuel in this way. Airlines can save money from the fact that the price of aviation fuel differs between European destinations. BA insiders say the company - like many airlines running short haul routes in Europe - has computer software that calculates whether costs can be saved by fuel tankering. The software will calculate whether there is a cost saving to be made. If there is, crews load up the extra fuel. An example of documents seen by Panorama show that a recent BA flight to Italy carried nearly three tonnes of extra fuel. British Airways owner IAG says strikes cost Â£121m British Airways flights to Cairo cancelled The extra weight meant the plane emitted more than 600kg of additional carbon dioxide - the same emissions one person is responsible for on a return flight to New York. The cost saving on that trip was less than Â£40, but the documents Panorama has seen show that it can be even lower than that. IAG made an annual profit of â¬2.9bn (Â£2.6bn) in 2018, about 80% of which came from BA. A BA insider described the practice as ""hypocritical"". ""For such a big company to be trying to save such small amounts while emitting so much extra CO2 seems unjustifiable in the current climate,"" he said. In response to the claims, the chief executive of BA's parent company, IAG, announced the airline would carry out a review of the practice. On Friday, Willie Walsh told investors that the airline wanted to ensure it was not ""incentivising the wrong behaviour"" from managers. ""Because clearly the financial saving would have incentivised us to do fuel tankering,"" he said. ""But maybe... this the wrong thing to do and the wrong thing to incentive. So we want to make sure we have our incentives aligned to the right activities so ensure financial sustainability but also environmental sustainability."" This video can not be played How to reduce your carbon footprint when you fly BA said it was common practice for the airline industry to carry additional fuel on some flights. The airline said for BA this applies mainly to short-haul destinations ""where there are considerable price differences between European airports"". It said the additional emissions from the airline represented approximately 2% of the total extra emissions generated by all airlines tankering fuel in Europe, based on research by Eurocontrol. BA pointed out that since 2012 all flights within Europe had been covered by the EU Emissions Trading System. It added that from 2020 the company would offset all CO2 emissions from its UK domestic flights. Easyjet said it had reduced the level of tankering in recent years and that it only took place on a tiny proportion of flights for operational and commercial reasons. Eurocontrol, the body which coordinates air traffic control for Europe, has calculated that tankering in Europe resulted in 286,000 tonnes of extra fuel being burnt every year, and the emission of an additional 901,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide. It calculates that the practice saved airlines a total of â¬265m (Â£228m) a year. Eurocontrol described the practice as ""questionable"" at a time when aviation is being challenged for its contribution to climate change.

Here's our top story on the main news of today. And check back tomorrow for the news from day seven of the election campaign. So there ends the sixth day in the official election campaign. There's still plenty more to come, with four weeks and two days until the poll on 12 December. Here's a recap of what happened today: Kevin McNamara - the candidate for Thurrock who is being investigated over tweets he allegedly posted - has resigned, a Lib Dem spokesperson says. ""A
disciplinary process has been instigated,"" they added. Screen shots circulated on Twitter show tweets Mr
McNamara allegedly sent, including racist and homophobic language. In a statement, Mr McNamara says he is ""deeply sorry"" for the comments. âThese words are deeply offensive and I apologise profusely to
everybody that I have offended with these tweets,"" he adds. âI
would never want to undermine the voices of those communities with slurs or
degradation and it's important that people who want to represent the public are
held to the very highest standard. I am resigning as a candidate with immediate
effect for the upcoming election. âI
apologise to all of those I have let down with my past conduct and will work
hard to regain their trust."" The Express calls it a ""huge election boost"" for Mr Johnson, adding that his announcement ""electrified"" the Tories' campaign. Polling experts say Mr Farage's move might not be enough to hand the Tories a majority, the Mail says. The Times reports that cabinet ministers have warned that Nigel Farage will be personally to
blame if Britain does not leave the EU, urging him to pull out of every marginal seat. And the Star also leads with a non-election story. The creator of Grange Hill wants the BBC to bring back his school drama, arguing it could help teach youngsters about things like knife crime. The Daily Mirror does not lead with an election story - but its top story on the flooding in the north of England does refer to the Tories' spending on flood defences. The Guardian calls it a ""dramatic public U-turn"" from Nigel Farage - and reports that senior Tories are now pressing behind the scenes for further concessions. Laura KuenssbergBBC political editor First of all, this does clearly gives Boris Johnson an easier time in some of the seats that the Tories need to hold - there's no question about that. But second of all, if he wants to get the majority that he craves, the Tories have to be taking seats from the other parties and particularly in this context, from Brexit voters who normally vote Labour. Now in a really tightly-fought seat - somewhere where it's really close between Labour and the Conservaive Party - if those natural Labour voters who were Brexiteers decide to go for the Brexit Party then the Tory Party would be very likely to come up short in their competition to get the majority that they crave. But the third thing to say about all of this. It was not so long ago that  in the European elections in the spring that Nigel Farage's Brexit Party looked like they had the chance of sweeping through the political establishment. That was his dream. And today he has been shown to have fallen well short of that. Of course his party is still likely to have an impact on this election. But in the words of one insider in Westminster tonight, it's like the finish line has been moved a little bit, but it's basically still the same race. The Telegraph says Mr Farage ""bowed to immense pressure from within his whole party"". Chris DoidgeBBC Radio Derby, political reporter The Conservative prospective candidate for Burton, Andrew Griffiths, has failed to win the backing of local Conservative Party members. A vote of the local association was split 50/50 - meaning the contest will be opened up to other candidates tomorrow. It's unclear whether Mr Griffiths will continue to pursue the nomination. The meeting at Burton Town Hall was described as fractious by many members, and some questioned whether the meeting was biased towards Mr Griffiths. The chair of the local Conservative association, Conor Wileman, said tonight he would not be able to campaign for Andrew Griffiths if he was selected. Andrew Griffiths was exposed in a Sunday newspaper as having sent 2,000 texts to two female constituents, many of them of a sexual nature. He says he's since received mental health treatment. He was cleared of wrongdoing by the parliamentary standards watchdog.The watchdog saidit found no evidence he sent them while he would have been engaged in parliamentary activities. Mr Griffiths left the meeting through a back door and did not comment publicly. Many BBC outlets will be broadcasting from Bishop Auckland in Country Durham tomorrow as we put the focus on a constituency where a big Labour majority of more than 20,000 has been steadily chipped away over the last six elections, so it is now regarded as a marginal seat. Labour's majority at the last election was just 502. Our radio colleague Adrian Goldberg is already busily touting for customers. Allow Twitter content?

"Shop worker: 'I am verbally abused every day'Threats and violent attacks towards shop workers are rising in the UK, according to a new survey.Business","STOCK PICTURE: Many shop workers suffer threats and even assaults from customers, says Usdaw Jackie McKenzie, 56, has worked at a supermarket petrol station in Bathgate, Scotland for the last 20 years. During that time, the amount of abuse she has faced while doing her job has been rising. ""I've been verbally abused on a daily basis,"" she said. ""It's getting a bit out of hand to be honest."" She is not alone, according to a new survey, which has found that retail staff are abused, threatened or assaulted on average 21 times a year. A survey of over 4,000 retail staff by shop workers' union Usdaw, found that around two-thirds have experienced verbal abuse, while 41% were threatened by a customer and nearly 5% were assaulted. The trade union has been campaigning to stop abusive behaviour towards retail staff for a number of years andin June called on the government to tackle the problem. Violent retail crime leading to PTSD for shop staff, report says 'I've been spat on, bitten and kicked' 'They took Â£150 from the till - was it really worth it?' ""People think that just because we work behind a till there's no reason to respect us,"" said Michelle Whitehead, 46, a convenience store worker in Wolverhampton. ""It's terrible to say but you get used to being threatened. When someone comes and shouts at you it does affect you. Sometimes you have to walk away from the counter and count till 10 so you don't burst into tears."" Ms Whitehead, who has been a retail worker for almost three decades, says that incidents used to occur once in a while but now she receives abuse from customers on a weekly basis. She said she often encounters difficulties when dealing with young people who are underage but seeking to purchase alcohol or cigarettes. She has also been spat at for refusing to hand over parcels from the post office counter without proof of ID. Retail worker Michelle Whitehead says that no one intervenes when customers shout at her Although neither Ms Whitehead or Ms McKenzie have been assaulted, they have witnessed violent attacks. Ms McKenzie said one night, while managing the shop on her own, she witnessed a young man run into the convenience store begging for help and a minute later, another boy had run in and started beating him up. ""I shouted to him to stop from behind the counter and pressed the panic button, and the police did come. But by that time the guy had a broken arm and a broken jaw, and the shop was trashed,"" she said. The two workers are campaigning for retailers and the government to make changes so retail staff can feel safe while they are at work. They want signs up in stores telling customers to respect staff, more police on patrol and for retailers to impose a life-time ban on customers who persistently abuse shop workers. Abusive customers should also have to face criminal charges, they said. ""If that's the only corner shop you can go to, it might make you think if you could have a life-time ban,"" said Ms Whitehead.

Is climate change to blame for Australia's fires?,"The scale and intensity of the bushfires is unprecedented Australia is enduring a bushfire crisis that has left three people dead, razed more than 150 homes, and prompted warnings of ""catastrophic"" danger. Bushfires are a regular feature in the Australian calendar, butthe blazes in New South Wales and Queenslandhave not previously occurred on such a scale and so early in the fire season, officials say. This has led many Australians to ask how closely the fires can be linked to climate change. The science around climate change is complex - it's not the cause of bushfires but scientists have long warned that a hotter, drier climate would contribute to Australia's fires becoming more frequent and more intense. But the nation's political leaders are facing a backlash for batting away questions on the subject. On Sunday, Prime Minister Scott Morrison refused to answer a question about climate change, saying: ""My only thoughts today are with those who have lost their lives and their families."" This video can not be played ""Unprecedented"" bushfires turn skies orange When asked the same question, New South Wales Premier Gladys Berejiklian told reporters: ""Honestly, not today."" Some Australians agreed, but others were furious the question was being ignored. Mr Morrison later tweeted to offer ""thoughts and prayers"" to those affected, but critics compared that to rhetoric used by US lawmakers who have opposed gun reforms after mass shootings. Deputy Prime Minister Michael McCormack stoked the most anger, when on Monday he dismissed climate change as the concerns of ""raving inner-city lefties"" who were ignoring the needs of rural Australians. ""We've had fires in Australia since time began,"" he said. The nation's target under the Paris Agreement- the global deal to tackle rising global temperatures - is a 26-28% reduction in emissions by 2030. Some have criticised that as inadequate for a G20 country. Last year, the UN reported that Australia - the world's largest coal exporter - was not on track to meet its commitment. Mr Morrison told the UN last year that Australia was doing its bit to address climate change, and ""balancing our global responsibilities with sensible and practical policies to secure our environmental and our economic future"". ""We find it very difficult in general to attribute climate change impacts to a specific event, particularly while the event is running,"" said Dr Richard Thornton, chief executive of the Bushfires & Natural Hazards Co-operative Research Centre. ""But what we do know is that the average temperature in Australia now is running about 1C above the long-term average."" He added fire seasons were starting earlier and ""the cumulative fire danger"" in many areas was growing. Farmers - Australia's 'unlikely' climate activists Living with the strain of a devastating drought Black Saturday 2009: The day Australia saw 'the gates of hell' Prof Glenda Wardle, an ecologist from the University of Sydney, agreed: ""It's not every weather event that is the direct result of climate change. But when you see trends... it becomes undeniably linked to global climate change."" Massive bushfires in November have destroyed hundreds of homes She said there was a ""collective shift"" in the timing and intensity of weather events. Australian National University climate scientist Dr Imran Ahmed called it a direct link: ""Because what climate change does is exacerbate the conditions in which the bushfires happen."" ""We will start to see the extreme end of the fire behaviour scale occur more frequently because of the increase of temperatures"", said Dr Thornton. ""Everything we normally see as variability between a good fire season and a bad season is sitting on top of that extra 1C - and that means that the severe events will occur more frequently."" This video can not be played Why Australia bushfires are now ""hotter and more intense"" But Prof Wardle said the government was ""passing the buck"" on climate change and not doing enough to help stem the rise in global temperatures. ""It hasn't just been fires, there's been flood, there's the drought,"" she said. ""Every time [the government] has had the chance to take on the big issue of climate change and do something, they choose not to and blame other things like land management."" Dr Ahmed said the leaders' responses this week were a ""very unfortunate"" reaction to peer-reviewed warnings by leading scientists. ""With that sort of evidence on the ground, it's hard to see that you still have the politics around doubting climate change,"" he said. The Bureau of Meteorology'sState of the Climate 2018 report,externalsaid climate change had led to an increase in extreme heat events and increased the severity of other natural disasters, such as drought. In April,23 former fire chiefs and emergency leaders issued a letter,external, warning the government about ""increasingly catastrophic extreme weather events"". It requested a meeting which was declined by the government. What is climate change?

Here's our top story on the main news of today. And check back tomorrow for the news from day seven of the election campaign. So there ends the sixth day in the official election campaign. There's still plenty more to come, with four weeks and two days until the poll on 12 December. Here's a recap of what happened today: Kevin McNamara - the candidate for Thurrock who is being investigated over tweets he allegedly posted - has resigned, a Lib Dem spokesperson says. ""A
disciplinary process has been instigated,"" they added. Screen shots circulated on Twitter show tweets Mr
McNamara allegedly sent, including racist and homophobic language. In a statement, Mr McNamara says he is ""deeply sorry"" for the comments. âThese words are deeply offensive and I apologise profusely to
everybody that I have offended with these tweets,"" he adds. âI
would never want to undermine the voices of those communities with slurs or
degradation and it's important that people who want to represent the public are
held to the very highest standard. I am resigning as a candidate with immediate
effect for the upcoming election. âI
apologise to all of those I have let down with my past conduct and will work
hard to regain their trust."" The Express calls it a ""huge election boost"" for Mr Johnson, adding that his announcement ""electrified"" the Tories' campaign. Polling experts say Mr Farage's move might not be enough to hand the Tories a majority, the Mail says. The Times reports that cabinet ministers have warned that Nigel Farage will be personally to
blame if Britain does not leave the EU, urging him to pull out of every marginal seat. And the Star also leads with a non-election story. The creator of Grange Hill wants the BBC to bring back his school drama, arguing it could help teach youngsters about things like knife crime. The Daily Mirror does not lead with an election story - but its top story on the flooding in the north of England does refer to the Tories' spending on flood defences. The Guardian calls it a ""dramatic public U-turn"" from Nigel Farage - and reports that senior Tories are now pressing behind the scenes for further concessions. Laura KuenssbergBBC political editor First of all, this does clearly gives Boris Johnson an easier time in some of the seats that the Tories need to hold - there's no question about that. But second of all, if he wants to get the majority that he craves, the Tories have to be taking seats from the other parties and particularly in this context, from Brexit voters who normally vote Labour. Now in a really tightly-fought seat - somewhere where it's really close between Labour and the Conservaive Party - if those natural Labour voters who were Brexiteers decide to go for the Brexit Party then the Tory Party would be very likely to come up short in their competition to get the majority that they crave. But the third thing to say about all of this. It was not so long ago that  in the European elections in the spring that Nigel Farage's Brexit Party looked like they had the chance of sweeping through the political establishment. That was his dream. And today he has been shown to have fallen well short of that. Of course his party is still likely to have an impact on this election. But in the words of one insider in Westminster tonight, it's like the finish line has been moved a little bit, but it's basically still the same race. The Telegraph says Mr Farage ""bowed to immense pressure from within his whole party"". Chris DoidgeBBC Radio Derby, political reporter The Conservative prospective candidate for Burton, Andrew Griffiths, has failed to win the backing of local Conservative Party members. A vote of the local association was split 50/50 - meaning the contest will be opened up to other candidates tomorrow. It's unclear whether Mr Griffiths will continue to pursue the nomination. The meeting at Burton Town Hall was described as fractious by many members, and some questioned whether the meeting was biased towards Mr Griffiths. The chair of the local Conservative association, Conor Wileman, said tonight he would not be able to campaign for Andrew Griffiths if he was selected. Andrew Griffiths was exposed in a Sunday newspaper as having sent 2,000 texts to two female constituents, many of them of a sexual nature. He says he's since received mental health treatment. He was cleared of wrongdoing by the parliamentary standards watchdog.The watchdog saidit found no evidence he sent them while he would have been engaged in parliamentary activities. Mr Griffiths left the meeting through a back door and did not comment publicly. Many BBC outlets will be broadcasting from Bishop Auckland in Country Durham tomorrow as we put the focus on a constituency where a big Labour majority of more than 20,000 has been steadily chipped away over the last six elections, so it is now regarded as a marginal seat. Labour's majority at the last election was just 502. Our radio colleague Adrian Goldberg is already busily touting for customers. Allow Twitter content?

Bird of prey 'grabs' Chihuahua in gardenThe dog's owners managed to prevent the bird flying off with their pet in Aberdeen.,"Emma the dog is now recovering A pet Chihuahua had a ""very lucky"" escape when a bird of prey tried to snatch it, according to its owners. Sheila Gillanders, 72, said 18-month-old Emma was only saved thanks to the quick actions of her husband Robert. The buzzard-like bird tried to take the pet from their garden in Aberdeen's Stoneywood on Friday. But Mr Gillanders, 65, managed to get to the predator and release the dog from its talons. Emma is now recovering at home after being treated by a vet. Mrs Gillanders said: ""We heard a bell and it was a bird of prey coming down - it must have escaped from its handler."" Seagull 'flew off with Gizmo the Chihuahua' She explained: ""It pinned her against the fence. It only got so far up, but my husband was able to get the bird off her. ""It then just looked at us. It was a really big bird, like a buzzard. It was definitely trained, as it was wearing a bell."" Emma was taken to the vet, and is receiving medication. Mrs Gillanders hopes the appeal will lead to the bird's handler to come forward. Her owner added: ""She is a bit bruised but otherwise she was not physically injured. ""Her stress is sky-high and we are struggling to get her back out in the garden. ""It was very lucky. If it had not been for my husband getting to her so quickly I dread to think what could have happened.""

Man admits Remembrance Sunday firework disruptionPyrotechnics went off above a war memorial as hundreds of people observed the two-minute silence.,"Stuart Potts claimed he set off the fireworks to emulate the volley of shots fired at some Remembrance Day events A man who admitted ruining a Remembrance Sunday event by setting off fireworks during a two-minute silence has been jailed for 16 weeks. Stuart Potts, 38, let off two fireworks as hundreds of people observed the silence at 11:00 GMT at the cenotaph in Eccles, Salford, on Sunday. Potts set off the fireworks while sitting on a ledge of a first-floor window in a nearby disused pub. He admitted throwing a firework in public, and a public order offence. Potts of Borough Road, Salford, who has 21 previous convictions, claimed he was given the fireworks by someone else and lit them ""as a mark of respect"" to emulate the volley of shots fired at some Remembrance Day events. Sentencing him at Manchester Magistrates' Court, District Judge Mark Hadfield said he did not believe Potts' story. He added: ""I rather doubt that anybody in their right mind would think letting them off in the middle of that ceremony was a mark of respect. ""It shows a staggering lack of respect for those attending and those being remembered."" This video can not be played Angry veterans shouted ""Get him out!"" before officers took a man away in a police car The fireworks exploded above the cenotaph as the Last Post ended. Beth Pilling, prosecuting, told the court the first resulted in loud bangs, and the second - a rocket - flew above the heads of the crowd gathered at the service. The court heard a crowd of angry veterans gathered outside the pub window in Church Street shouting, ""Get him out!"" and tried to break the door of the pub down, while others attempted to climb up to the window. When Potts appeared at the window to remonstrate with the crowd, a number of traffic cones were thrown at him before he was arrested. Fireworks exploded as the Last Post ended and hundreds of people were observing a two-minute silence The court heard a statement from an ex-Royal Marine who was at the event to place a cross on the cenotaph for a fallen comrade. He said the loud bangs reminded him of combat and it had affected his post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). It was the most disrespectful thing he had witnessed at such an event, he added. No injuries were reported. Abigail Henry, mitigating, said Potts had shown ""sincere and genuine remorse for his actions"".

Johnson rejects Farage pact,"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: Election pact with Brexit Party 'risks putting Corbyn into No 10' Boris Johnson has rejected the suggestion from Nigel Farage and Donald Trump that he should work with the Brexit Party during the election. The Tory leader told the BBC he was ""always grateful for advice"" but he would not enter into election pacts. His comments come after the US president said Mr Farage and Mr Johnson would be ""an unstoppable force"". Downing Street sources say there are no circumstances in which the Tories would work with the Brexit Party. In an interview with BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg, the prime minister said the ""difficulty"" of doing deals with ""any other party"" was that it ""simply risks putting Jeremy Corbyn into Number 10"". ""The problem with that is that his [Mr Corbyn's] plan for Brexit is basically yet more dither and delay,"" Mr Johnson said. Mr Johnson also said there was ""no question of negotiating on the NHS"" as part of any future trade deal with the US, but he did not rule out expanding the amount of private provision in the health service in the future. But Labour's shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, said the public ""can't trust the Tories on the NHS"", saying they would ""increase privatisation even further and do a deal with Donald Trump"". Kuenssberg: Colourful words no guarantee of election success First head-to-head TV election debate announced Jeremy Corbyn vows to 'transform' UK Could the NHS be ""up for sale"" to US companies? A really simple guide to the UK general election Farage calls on Johnson to 'build Leave alliance' When pushed on whether he would rule out a deal with Mr Farage, Mr Johnson replied: ""I want to be very, very clear that voting for any other party than this government, this Conservative governmentâ¦ is basically tantamount to putting Jeremy Corbyn in."" The UK is going to the polls on 12 December following a further delay to the UK's departure from the EU, to 31 January 2020. The BBC will be talking to other party leaders during the course of the campaign. US president Donald Trumptold Nigel Farage's LBC show on Thursday,externalthat the Brexit Party leader should team up with Mr Johnson to do ""something terrific"" and he also criticised the prime minister's EU withdrawal agreement. Meanwhile, Mr Farage has called on the prime minister to drop his Brexit deal, unite in a ""Leave alliance"" or face a Brexit Party candidate in every seat in the election. Mr Johnson said there were ""lots of reasons"" why he thought a Labour government would be a ""disaster"". He said he Labour government would lead to a renegotiation with Brussels on a Brexit deal, then another referendum. ""Why go through that nightmare again?"" he said. The prime minister also suggested that the US president was wrong to believe a trade deal would be impossible with the UK after Brexit. Mr Johnson said his ""proper Brexit"" deal ""enables us to do proper all-singing, all-dancing free-trade deals"". This video can not be played Farage: Trump is a 'fan of Boris Johnson' ""It delivers exactly what we wanted, what I wanted, when I campaigned in 2016 to come out the European Union,"" Mr Johnson said. When asked about the criticism from Mr Trump, Mr Johnson said: ""I am always grateful for advice from wherever it comes and we have great relations as you know with the US and many many other countries. ""But on the technicalities of the deal anybody who looks at it can see that the UK has full control."" The prime minister is never short of a word or two, never short of a colourful phrase or a metaphor. When we sat down this afternoon there wasno suggestion of him being the Hulk,external, but Remain-tending MPs were accused of ""rope-a-doping"" the government, planning eventually to batter the prime minister and his Brexit deal into submission until he would have had to give up. But in Downing Street there is a serious awareness that trademark Johnson verbal gymnastics are no guarantee of success at the ballot box in six weeks' time, no guarantee at all. That's not just because there are even friends, like Donald Trump, and of course foes, like Jeremy Corbyn, whose words and actions will hamper his attempt to secure a majority to call his own. But also because this is a snap election, not a routine poll, and the public is hardly in a forgiving mood of our politicians right now. Read more from Laura Mr Johnson said he hoped the government could get Brexit ""over the line"" by the middle of January if he won a majority, claiming the current Parliament would never have passed his deal. He said he'd had ""no choice"" but to call a general election, saying: ""Nobody wants an election but we've got to do it now. ""This is a Parliament that is basically full of MPs who voted Remain. ""They voted Remain and they will continue to block Brexit if they're given the chance - we need a new mandate, we need to refresh our Parliament."" Mr Johnson said his government was determined to increase taxpayer funding of the NHS but said: ""Of course there are dentists and optometrists and so on who are providers to the NHS, of course, that's how it works,"" he said. ""But... I believe passionately in an NHS free at the point of use for everybody in this country."" Labour's Mr Ashworth said: ""Forced NHS privatisation has doubled under the Conservatives and Boris Johnson has refused to rule out expanding this further. ""You can't trust the Tories on the NHS. They will increase privatisation even further and do a deal with Donald Trump that will see as much as Â£500m more a week sent to US corporations.""

What is tactical voting,"The result of the 2019 general election could determine whether Brexit happens or not. Some parties have withdrawn candidates to help their rivals. Meanwhile, campaign groups are encouraging people to use tactical-voting websites, to help them decide which candidate to support. So, what are election pacts and tactical voting - and how does each work? Parties and candidates themselves sometimes make tactical decisions. This generally means one party agreeing not to stand candidates in certain areas, so that another party with similar views on key issues has a stronger change of winning. The aim is to stop the vote splitting, which could help rivals with very different views from taking the seat. In Canterbury,Liberal Democrat candidate Tim Walker has stood downbecause he feared dividing the Remain vote. He said he was concerned standing would allow the Conservative candidate to take the seat from Labour. And the Brexit Party has announcedit will not contest the 317 seats won by the Conservatives in 2017.This is so as not to split the pro-Brexit vote in those areas. Instead, it says it will concentrate its efforts on taking seats from Labour, whom it suggested had ""betrayed"" its Leave-supporting voters. The Green Party hasstood down its candidatein Chingford and Woodford Green, to help Labour try to unseat former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith. Separately, anti-Brexit parties Plaid Cymru, the Liberal Democrats and the Greenshave agreed an electoral pact in 11 of the 40 seats in Wales. The aim is to get as many Remain-supporting MPs elected as possible. Back in August,the Lib Dems beat the Conservatives in the Brecon and Radnorshire by-election, after Plaid Cymru and the Greens agreed not to stand. Labourhas ruled out forming pacts with other parties. Put simply, tactical voting is when any of the UK's voters chooses to back a candidate they wouldn't normally support. This is done in the hope of stopping another candidate winning. This could happen in a constituency where two parties are in a tight race and candidates from other parties trail far behind. In these circumstances, a supporter of the candidate who was a distant third, might pick their favourite of the two who are in with a chance. At this election, campaigners say voting tactically could help MPs who share voters' views on Brexit win more seats. A number of tactical voting websites have been set up, but there iscriticism over the nature of their advice,external.  45,775,800registered UK voters (Dec 2018) 3,304candidates in the 2017 general election 650parliamentary constituencies 24%surveyed plan to vote tactically 66%would vote for their first preference In a general election, the UK's voters are invited to choose an MP for their area - one of 650 constituencies. The UK uses a first-past-the-post voting system, sometimes described as ""winner takes all"". It means the local candidate who receives the most votes becomes an MP - and the party with the most winning candidates nationally normally forms a government. Coming a good second does not help a party win any more power in Parliament. Tactical voting is perfectly legal in the UK. Voters are free to choose any candidate on the ballot paper, no matter what the reason is. See how people voted in your area in 2017 How late can you register to vote in a general election? A really simple guide to the general election Do voters want a referendum or an election? More news explainers This election is going to be highly unpredictable, researchers atthe British Election Study,externalsay. That's because voters could be more likely to switch their support, largely because of the uncertainty over Brexit. Last month, the Electoral Reform Society campaign group asked polling company BMG Research to find out how widespread tactical voting might be. Of 1,500 voters questioned,24% said they planned to vote tactically to keep out a candidate they dislike,external. That compares with 66% who said they would vote for their first preference - regardless of how likely they were to win. The remaining 10% said they didn't know. When the same question was asked before the 2017 general election, 20% of people said they planned to vote tactically. Tactical voting has been a very powerful tool in the past, says Stephen Fisher, professor of political sociology at the University of Oxford. ""It played a big role in delivering a landslide for Labour's Tony Blair in 1997 and it's been a staple of elections since then,"" he says. Could snow delay the vote?

Pro-EU parties agree election deal,"This video can not be played The Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru and the Green Party have agreed not to stand against each other. The Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru and the Green Party have formed an electoral pact, agreeing not to stand against each other in dozens of seats. The deal between the three anti-Brexit parties will cover 60 constituencies across England and Wales. Chair of the Unite to Remain group Heidi Allen said it was ""an opportunity to tip the balance of power"". The three parties all support another Brexit referendum and want the UK to remain in the EU. Their pact means that, in Wales, two of the parties will agree not to field a candidate, boosting the third candidate's chances of picking up the Remain vote. In England, it will simply be a two-way agreement between the Lib Dems and the Greens. Lib Dem candidate Layla Moran said the Unite to Remain group had approached Labour about pacts, but ""they said no [and] they didn't even enter into those conversations"". In a speech in Liverpool earlier, Labour's shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, said: ""We will never enter pacts, coalitions, or deals like that - ever."" And the SNP's Stephen Gethins said: ""If other parties want to deliver a Remain message in Scotland, they know they have to get behind the SNP."" Thursday marks exactly five weeks until the UK general election on 12 December. What is tactical voting? Labour plans to shift power to the North Students more likely to vote tactically on Brexit Your Questions Answered: Who can stand for election? ""We are delighted that an agreement has been reached,"" said Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson. ""This is a significant moment for all people who want to support Remain candidates across the country."" The pact follows a similar deal earlier this year in the Brecon and Radnorshire by-election, when Plaid Cymru and the Greens agreed not to put forward a candidate but instead gave way to the Lib Dems' Jane Dodds. Shewent on to defeatthe Conservative incumbent, Chris Davies. Lib Dem MP Jane Dodds (third from left) celebrates her by-election win Analysis by BBC political analyst Peter Barnes It's impossible to know in advance whether this will affect who wins any of the constituencies. None of them would have had a different result in 2017 if Liberal Democrat, Plaid Cymru and Green votes had been added together. It's also likely that Brexit will have a bigger influence on how people vote at this election, so the idea of having a united candidate for Remain could give them a boost. There are some seats already held by one of the parties where their majorities will be bolstered, such as Arfon and Bath. And there are other places where it makes it a bit easier to win, such as Cheltenham, Montgomeryshire and Winchester - all places the Lib Dems are gunning for - and Ynys Mon, a target for Plaid. In England, the Greens will stand aside for the Lib Dems in 40 seats including Totnes, York Outer, Winchester and Twickenham. And the Green Party will run unchallenged by the Lib Dems in nine seats including the Isle of Wight, Bristol West, Exeter and Brighton Pavilion - where Caroline Lucas is the Greens' only MP. The pact comes afterPlaid Cymru's leader Adam Price wroteto several pro-Remain parties earlier this year, calling on them to work together in a snap general election. In Wales, the plan will involve the Lib Dems and Greens standing their candidates aside for Plaid Cymru in seven seats including Pontypridd. The deal does not involve the Ceredigion seat - which is currently held by Plaid Cymru but is a top election target for the Lib Dems. However Mike Powell, who had been the Lib Dem candidate in Pontypridd, said he would run as an independent against Plaid Cymru. He told Radio 4's World at One: ""I think the people deserve to have an opportunity to vote for someone who is going to represent the people of Pontypridd, rather than standing to represent a cause to remove Wales from the United Kingdom. ""I know there is an awful lot of members in the Welsh Liberal Democrats who are extremely unhappy with the way these negotiations have been dealt with."" The prospective parliamentary candidates for Pontypridd chosen by their parties so far include Alex Davies-Jones (Labour), Steve Bayliss (the Brexit Party) and Fflur Elin (Plaid Cymru). Read more about the pact in Wales In Northern Ireland the Green Party has said it will not stand candidates in East, West or North Belfast. Green Party NI leader Clare Bailey said she was ""prepared to put the need to have pro-Remain MPs returned ahead of party interest"". Sinn Fein leader Michelle O'Neill welcomed the move, which she said would maximise ""the representation of pro-Remain and progressive candidates facing down DUP Brexiteers across Belfast"". Last week, Brexit Party leader Nigel Faragecalled on Boris Johnsonto form a similar election pact. He wanted the PM to drop his Brexit deal and then agree to stand aside candidates for each other. Mr Johnsonrejected the offerand said he would not enter election pacts.

Village 'has not been flooded for 100 years',"One villager said Fishlake ""has not been flooded for 100 years"" Residents of a heavily flooded village in Yorkshire fear conditions could get worse as more rain is forecast. The Environment Agency has 39 flood warnings in place across the country, including five severe warnings on the River Don in South Yorkshire. About 400 homes have been flooded in the North, and 1,200 properties have been evacuated, the agency said. Boris Johnson has called a meeting to discuss the government's response after criticism from Jeremy Corbyn. Doncaster Council has called for people to evacuate the village of Fishlake, near Doncaster, saying it ""can only offer dedicated support to people who are not in an area where there is a threat to life"". But farmers say they are unable to leave as they need to care for their livestock. Community rallies to help flood-hit villagers A yellow warning for rain remains in place over parts of Yorkshire and the East Midlands for Monday, Tuesday and Thursday. An emergency appeal to support ""displaced"" families has raised almost Â£50,000. Four Environment Agency pumps are now in operation in Fishlake to pump out floodwater from the village. Doncaster Council said it is ""still an emergency situation"" with five areas in the borough under a severe flood warning, meaning a ""significant risk to life"". The authority said the previous evacuation advice still stands for all areas. Twelve flood warnings remain in Lincolnshire where more than 1,000 acres have been flooded by Barlings Eau and some farms are cut off. This video can not be played A Lincolnshire farmer cut off by floodwater talks about his frustrations Jeremy Corbyn has written to Prime Minister Boris Johnson urging him to take greater action over the flooding and criticising him for not declaring a national emergency. ""If this had happened in Surrey, not Yorkshire or the East Midlands, it seems far more likely that a national emergency would have been declared,"" he said. The prime minister said he will chair an emergency Cobra meeting on Tuesday to discuss the government's response to the flooding. Pam Webb said she was devastated by the impact of the floods Pam Webb, who owns a spa in Fishlake, said she bought her property in 2004 and had surveys done at the time. ""There was nothing of any concern raised, Fishlake hadn't flooded in 100 years,"" she said. ""We need to now establish why and how and who should be accountable. ""Is it the flood defences that weren't sufficient to hold it? Did something give at some other point?"" A funeral parlour in Fishlake was hit by flooding Ms Webb said she had just found out her insurance would not cover the damage because of a flood exemption on the policy. ""It's my home and my business,"" she said. ""I work with a great team of girls and that's their livelihoods affected and my own as well."" The village church is collecting food to distribute to residents and roast dinners were delivered on Sunday to those who had remained in their homes. Empty coffins were seen floating inside the workshop of a flooded funeral parlour in the village. Farmer Robert Robinson called for the River Don to be dredged Tractors and boats have been used to get around the village, with many roadsin the area under floodwater. Military helicoptershave been used,externalto help boost flood defences in the area. The Environment Agency called in an RAF Chinook late on Sunday to move 40 tonnes of aggregate from a quarry to bolster drainage channels east of Bentley Farmer Robert Robinson said: ""My whole farm is just covered in water. We've animals that are suffering because of the water and we can't get in and out without tractors. ""We desperately need the River Don to be dredged and cleaned out, it's there to transport water and it's not doing its job properly."" Stephen Gilleard, another farmer from the village, said: ""You learn to live with nature and, as a farmer, you deal with things but you can't deal with this. ""There's a lot of volume of water here to move, we've still not got no pumps in place starting to get rid of any of it, it's a bad forecast for Thursday, more rain to come, and, unless we move some of this water, there's no room for any more."" Adrian Gill, a flood manager with the Environment Agency, said it did not currently dredge the River Don ""because we don't think that's the right thing to do"" but the situation could be reviewed in the future. A flooded field 100m from the River Don on the outskirts of Kirk Bramwith in South Yorkshire Many parts of Fishlake remain under 3ft (1m) of water Some train lines remain blocked by high water. Northern saidits services into Rotherham Central,externalwere not running until further notice, with reduced services between Doncaster and Sheffield. CrossCountry's trains are beingdiverted away from Doncaster,external. Doncaster Council saida number of roads,externalremained closed. According to the Salvation Army, some people have been rescued from their homes by boat since the early hours of Saturday, but others remain in their properties. Rescuers used boats to reach people trapped in Rotherham One woman said she had no insurance to cover the cost of damage to her home in Bentley, near Doncaster, after it flooded over the weekend. April Wingfield, who had to be rescued from her home by boat, said: ""I'm devastated, I'm just going to have to start from scratch."" She said the situation was worse than in 2007, when 2,200 properties were flooded across Sheffield withdamage estimated at Â£400min the Lower Don Valley alone. The RSPCA has been involved in a rescue operation to save 60 swans following an oil spillage caused by flooding in Rotherham. Further south, parts of Derbyshire are still affected by flooding. Areas around Matlock - where former High Sherriff of DerbyshireAnnie Hall was swept to her deathby the flooded River Derwent - are continuing their clean-up efforts, with further rain over the weekend leaving standing water along a number of roads.

"Shop worker: 'I am verbally abused every day'Threats and violent attacks towards shop workers are rising in the UK, according to a new survey.","STOCK PICTURE: Many shop workers suffer threats and even assaults from customers, says Usdaw Jackie McKenzie, 56, has worked at a supermarket petrol station in Bathgate, Scotland for the last 20 years. During that time, the amount of abuse she has faced while doing her job has been rising. ""I've been verbally abused on a daily basis,"" she said. ""It's getting a bit out of hand to be honest."" She is not alone, according to a new survey, which has found that retail staff are abused, threatened or assaulted on average 21 times a year. A survey of over 4,000 retail staff by shop workers' union Usdaw, found that around two-thirds have experienced verbal abuse, while 41% were threatened by a customer and nearly 5% were assaulted. The trade union has been campaigning to stop abusive behaviour towards retail staff for a number of years andin June called on the government to tackle the problem. Violent retail crime leading to PTSD for shop staff, report says 'I've been spat on, bitten and kicked' 'They took Â£150 from the till - was it really worth it?' ""People think that just because we work behind a till there's no reason to respect us,"" said Michelle Whitehead, 46, a convenience store worker in Wolverhampton. ""It's terrible to say but you get used to being threatened. When someone comes and shouts at you it does affect you. Sometimes you have to walk away from the counter and count till 10 so you don't burst into tears."" Ms Whitehead, who has been a retail worker for almost three decades, says that incidents used to occur once in a while but now she receives abuse from customers on a weekly basis. She said she often encounters difficulties when dealing with young people who are underage but seeking to purchase alcohol or cigarettes. She has also been spat at for refusing to hand over parcels from the post office counter without proof of ID. Retail worker Michelle Whitehead says that no one intervenes when customers shout at her Although neither Ms Whitehead or Ms McKenzie have been assaulted, they have witnessed violent attacks. Ms McKenzie said one night, while managing the shop on her own, she witnessed a young man run into the convenience store begging for help and a minute later, another boy had run in and started beating him up. ""I shouted to him to stop from behind the counter and pressed the panic button, and the police did come. But by that time the guy had a broken arm and a broken jaw, and the shop was trashed,"" she said. The two workers are campaigning for retailers and the government to make changes so retail staff can feel safe while they are at work. They want signs up in stores telling customers to respect staff, more police on patrol and for retailers to impose a life-time ban on customers who persistently abuse shop workers. Abusive customers should also have to face criminal charges, they said. ""If that's the only corner shop you can go to, it might make you think if you could have a life-time ban,"" said Ms Whitehead. Shop staff 'attacked with axes, needles, machetes' Retailers call for action on shop violence LA mayor says winds and drought created 'perfect storm', while officials hit out at looters Biden praises Carter's character as former president's coffin heads to Georgia Henry Zeffman: Market trouble threatens Labour's economic plans The '9/11 mastermind' is set to plead guilty.

Here's our top story on the main news of today. And check back tomorrow for the news from day seven of the election campaign. So there ends the sixth day in the official election campaign. There's still plenty more to come, with four weeks and two days until the poll on 12 December. Here's a recap of what happened today: Kevin McNamara - the candidate for Thurrock who is being investigated over tweets he allegedly posted - has resigned, a Lib Dem spokesperson says. ""A
disciplinary process has been instigated,"" they added. Screen shots circulated on Twitter show tweets Mr
McNamara allegedly sent, including racist and homophobic language. In a statement, Mr McNamara says he is ""deeply sorry"" for the comments. âThese words are deeply offensive and I apologise profusely to
everybody that I have offended with these tweets,"" he adds. âI
would never want to undermine the voices of those communities with slurs or

held to the very highest standard. I am resigning as a candidate with immediate
effect for the upcoming election. âI
apologise to all of those I have let down with my past conduct and will work
hard to regain their trust."" The Express calls it a ""huge election boost"" for Mr Johnson, adding that his announcement ""electrified"" the Tories' campaign. Polling experts say Mr Farage's move might not be enough to hand the Tories a majority, the Mail says. The Times reports that cabinet ministers have warned that Nigel Farage will be personally to
blame if Britain does not leave the EU, urging him to pull out of every marginal seat. And the Star also leads with a non-election story. The creator of Grange Hill wants the BBC to bring back his school drama, arguing it could help teach youngsters about things like knife crime. The Daily Mirror does not lead with an election story - but its top story on the flooding in the north of England does refer to the Tories' spending on flood defences. The Guardian calls it a ""dramatic public U-turn"" from Nigel Farage - and reports that senior Tories are now pressing behind the scenes for further concessions. Laura KuenssbergBBC political editor First of all, this does clearly gives Boris Johnson an easier time in some of the seats that the Tories need to hold - there's no question about that. But second of all, if he wants to get the majority that he craves, the Tories have to be taking seats from the other parties and particularly in this context, from Brexit voters who normally vote Labour. Now in a really tightly-fought seat - somewhere where it's really close between Labour and the Conservaive Party - if those natural Labour voters who were Brexiteers decide to go for the Brexit Party then the Tory Party would be very likely to come up short in their competition to get the majority that they crave. But the third thing to say about all of this. It was not so long ago that  in the European elections in the spring that Nigel Farage's Brexit Party looked like they had the chance of sweeping through the political establishment. That was his dream. And today he has been shown to have fallen well short of that. Of course his party is still likely to have an impact on this election. But in the words of one insider in Westminster tonight, it's like the finish line has been moved a little bit, but it's basically still the same race. The Telegraph says Mr Farage ""bowed to immense pressure from within his whole party"". Chris DoidgeBBC Radio Derby, political reporter The Conservative prospective candidate for Burton, Andrew Griffiths, has failed to win the backing of local Conservative Party members. A vote of the local association was split 50/50 - meaning the contest will be opened up to other candidates tomorrow. It's unclear whether Mr Griffiths will continue to pursue the nomination. The meeting at Burton Town Hall was described as fractious by many members, and some questioned whether the meeting was biased towards Mr Griffiths. The chair of the local Conservative association, Conor Wileman, said tonight he would not be able to campaign for Andrew Griffiths if he was selected. Andrew Griffiths was exposed in a Sunday newspaper as having sent 2,000 texts to two female constituents, many of them of a sexual nature. He says he's since received mental health treatment. He was cleared of wrongdoing by the parliamentary standards watchdog.The watchdog saidit found no evidence he sent them while he would have been engaged in parliamentary activities. Mr Griffiths left the meeting through a back door and did not comment publicly. Many BBC outlets will be broadcasting from Bishop Auckland in Country Durham tomorrow as we put the focus on a constituency where a big Labour majority of more than 20,000 has been steadily chipped away over the last six elections, so it is now regarded as a marginal seat. Labour's majority at the last election was just 502. Our radio colleague Adrian Goldberg is already busily touting for customers. Allow Twitter content?

The first of tomorrow's newspaper front pages has arrived and its top story is on the big election news of today: Nigel Farage's withdrawing of hundreds of candidates from Tory-held seats. The Financial Times calls it a ""humbling
moment"" for Mr Farage. At the weekend, a spending row broke out after the Conservatives claimed they had added up Labour's policies and estimated they would cost Â£1.2tn over the course of the next five years. Chris Morris, from the BBC's fact-checking team Reality Check, says the figure the Tories came out with over the weekend is ""basically a fag packet calculation"" - although ""quite a big fag packet"" as their estimation is more than 30 pages long. But there's a few problems with the way they've come up with the figure, he tells the BBC's Electioncast. Watch him explain more here: Allow Twitter content?

Laura KuenssbergBBC political editor First of all, this does clearly gives Boris Johnson an easier time in some of the seats that the Tories need to hold - there's no question about that. But second of all, if he wants to get the majority that he craves, the Tories have to be taking seats from the other parties and particularly in this context, from Brexit voters who normally vote Labour. Now in a really tightly-fought seat - somewhere where it's really close between Labour and the Conservaive Party - if those natural Labour voters who were Brexiteers decide to go for the Brexit Party then the Tory Party would be very likely to come up short in their competition to get the majority that they crave. But the third thing to say about all of this. It was not so long ago that  in the European elections in the spring that Nigel Farage's Brexit Party looked like they had the chance of sweeping through the political establishment. That was his dream. And today he has been shown to have fallen well short of that. Of course his party is still likely to have an impact on this election. But in the words of one insider in Westminster tonight, it's like the finish line has been moved a little bit, but it's basically still the same race. The Telegraph says Mr Farage ""bowed to immense pressure from within his whole party"". Chris DoidgeBBC Radio Derby, political reporter The Conservative prospective candidate for Burton, Andrew Griffiths, has failed to win the backing of local Conservative Party members. A vote of the local association was split 50/50 - meaning the contest will be opened up to other candidates tomorrow. It's unclear whether Mr Griffiths will continue to pursue the nomination. The meeting at Burton Town Hall was described as fractious by many members, and some questioned whether the meeting was biased towards Mr Griffiths. The chair of the local Conservative association, Conor Wileman, said tonight he would not be able to campaign for Andrew Griffiths if he was selected. Andrew Griffiths was exposed in a Sunday newspaper as having sent 2,000 texts to two female constituents, many of them of a sexual nature. He says he's since received mental health treatment. He was cleared of wrongdoing by the parliamentary standards watchdog.The watchdog saidit found no evidence he sent them while he would have been engaged in parliamentary activities. Mr Griffiths left the meeting through a back door and did not comment publicly. Many BBC outlets will be broadcasting from Bishop Auckland in Country Durham tomorrow as we put the focus on a constituency where a big Labour majority of more than 20,000 has been steadily chipped away over the last six elections, so it is now regarded as a marginal seat.

Here's our top story on the main news of today. And check back tomorrow for the news from day seven of the election campaign. So there ends the sixth day in the official election campaign. There's still plenty more to come, with four weeks and two days until the poll on 12 December. Here's a recap of what happened today: Kevin McNamara - the candidate for Thurrock who is being investigated over tweets he allegedly posted - has resigned, a Lib Dem spokesperson says. ""A
disciplinary process has been instigated,"" they added. Screen shots circulated on Twitter show tweets Mr
McNamara allegedly sent, including racist and homophobic language. In a statement, Mr McNamara says he is ""deeply sorry"" for the comments. âThese words are deeply offensive and I apologise profusely to
everybody that I have offended with these tweets,"" he adds. âI
would never want to undermine the voices of those communities with slurs or
degradation and it's important that people who want to represent the public are
held to the very highest standard. I am resigning as a candidate with immediate
effect for the upcoming election. âI
apologise to all of those I have let down with my past conduct and will work
hard to regain their trust."" The Express calls it a ""huge election boost"" for Mr Johnson, adding that his announcement ""electrified"" the Tories' campaign. Polling experts say Mr Farage's move might not be enough to hand the Tories a majority, the Mail says. The Times reports that cabinet ministers have warned that Nigel Farage will be personally to
blame if Britain does not leave the EU, urging him to pull out of every marginal seat. And the Star also leads with a non-election story. The creator of Grange Hill wants the BBC to bring back his school drama, arguing it could help teach youngsters about things like knife crime.

Breaking|Breaking newsBrexit Party won't stand in Tory seats - FarageNigel Farage says Brexit Party won't contest seats won by Tories in 2017 - but will stand in all Labour seats,"This video can not be played Farage: ""The Brexit Party will not contest 317 seats"" Nigel Farage has ditched plans to take on the Tories in more than 300 seats, after what he said was Boris Johnson's ""shift of position"" on Brexit. The Brexit Party leader had planned to run candidates in 600 seats after Mr Johnson rejected his offer of a ""Leave alliance"" to deliver Brexit. But he has been under pressure not to split the pro-Brexit vote. The party will not now stand in 317 seats won by the Tories in 2017, but will continue to stand elsewhere. Mr Farage said his party would focus its efforts on trying to take seats held by Labour, whom he accused of ""betraying"" its Leave-supporting voters. LIVE: Farage 'giving Johnson half a chance' Lib Dems, Greens and Plaid agree election pact What is tactical voting? The BBC's Alex Forsyth said some Brexit Party candidates had expressed concern about Mr Farage's plan to stand against the Tories in 600 constituencies, fearing it could hand an election victory to Labour and lead to another EU referendum. The Brexit Party is less than a year old and does not have any MPs - but it was the clear winner in the UK'sEuropean elections in May, with more than 30% of the vote. Mr Johnson welcomed Mr Farage's move, calling it ""a recognition that there's only one way to get Brexit done, and that's to vote for the Conservatives"". Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said Donald Trump ""got his wish"" when Mr Farage announced his electoral strategy. He said the Brexit Party leader was offering a ""Trump alliance"" that would lead to ""Thatcherism on steroids"" and threaten the future of the NHS. The US president hadpreviously urgedMr Farage to team up with Boris Johnson, saying they would be ""an unstoppable force"". Liberal Democrat deputy leader Sir Ed Davey said Mr Farage's decision ""shows the Conservatives and the Brexit Party are now one and the same"". Mr Farage made the announcement in Labour-held Hartlepool - a top target for his party Explaining his U-turn to supporters in Hartlepool, Mr Farage said Boris Johnson had recently signalled a ""big shift of position"" in his approach to Brexit. He cited a pledge by the PM not to extend thetransition periodthat would follow the UK's departure from the EU under the terms of his Brexit deal. The period would see the UK stick to the EU rules on issues such as freedom of movement until December 2020. Mr Farage also said he was encouraged by recent commitments from Mr Johnson to seek further divergence from EU rules in a post-Brexit trade deal. He added that this was a ""huge change"" from the kind of trade pact that had been planned under former PM Theresa May. Mr Farage's decision prompted dismay among some Brexit Party candidates who had been hoping to stand in Tory-held seats next month. Neil Greaves, who had been due to stand for the party in the Essex seat of Harlow, told the PA news agency that Mr Farage had ""let Brexiteers down"". He said he planned to continue to stand in the constituency as an independent pro-Brexit candidate, and urged fellow former candidates to do the same. The party's candidate in Mansfieldtweeted,externalthat the move meant the ""opportunity to stand up for democracy"" had been ""snatched away"" from candidates. Why candidates stand down to help other parties Poll tracker: How do the parties compare? Election translator: What does it all mean? Mr Farage had previously offered to not stand candidates against the Tories in certain seats if the prime minister changed aspects of his Brexit deal. But the proposal was rejected by Boris Johnson, who said deals with ""any other party"" would ""risk putting Jeremy Corbyn into No 10"". Mr Farage said he had ""genuinely tried"" to forge a so-called ""Leave alliance"" with the Tories, but his efforts had gone nowhere. ""In a sense we now have a Leave alliance, it's just that we've done it unilaterally,"" he added. Mr Farage has already confirmed he willnot be standing himselfin the election, saying he wanted to concentrate on helping his party's candidates. Hypothetically, the decision by the Brexit Party leader makes it notionally easier for the Tories to keep seats they hold already. But it's a million miles away from giving them a clear run. Mr Farage says he will still stand candidates in Labour areas. And for the prime minister to get the majority he craves, the Tories have to take seats that are currently held by Labour, not just hold on their existing MPs. Read more from Laura. Scottish National Party leader Nicola Sturgeon said the Conservatives have ""effectively become the Brexit Party"". She added that defeating the Tories in Scotland ""will help deprive Boris Johnson's increasingly extreme and right-wing party of the majority they crave"". Anti-Brexit parties Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats have agreednot to stand against each otherin 60 seats across England and Wales. Their pact means that, in Wales, two of the parties will agree not to field a candidate, boosting the third candidate's chances of picking up the Remain vote. In England, it will simply be a two-way agreement between the Lib Dems and the Greens.

'We fear for our town's future',"The Buckley family are concerned about the future of Scunthorpe ""I think it will just go downhill. It'll be left almost barren."" Julian Buckley paints a gloomy picture of his hometown of Scunthorpe if the British Steel plant closes down. Sitting around the family dining room table over a fish-and-chip supper, Julian, aged 21, tells me he hopes to come back home to live after graduating from Liverpool University. ""I actually want to work in health and safety, which the steelworks would be such a good employer for. ""But if it's not there, I'll have to look somewhere else. And that's the problem really, isn't it?"" Network Rail bids for part of British Steel Steelworks town faces 'fight for future' Julian's father Matthew has been working at British Steel's on-site power station in Scunthorpe for 19 years, but now fears losing his job. ""The last few months have been quite awful really,"" he admits, reflecting on months of rumour and fear about the future of the plant. Matthew, who is 50, has faced this situation before.  He used to work at British Steel in Stoke-on-Trent and left just before it closed in 2000. ""We started to reduce shift patterns,"" he recalls. ""You felt that the writing was on the wall, and it was only a matter of time before that closed, so we decided to take the plunge and we transferred up here."" The family settled in the pretty village of Winterton, six miles north of the town centre. But in 2016, Matthew faced another job crisis when Tata, the owners of the Scunthorpe plant, decided to sell up. ""We were at a really sticky place there,"" Matthew says. ""It took a long time to get the ball rolling and get some interest from the central government. ""We had marches in Scunthorpe and London to keep steelmaking alive and well in the town."" The campaign worked. London-based Greybull Capital moved in to save the company, but it was only a temporary reprieve. In May, they too conceded defeat andBritish Steel was forced into liquidation. Matthew's wife Joy, 48, says:  ""If the worst comes to worst, and the steelworks does actually shut, it will be devastating for so many people here. ""People will probably have to move away."" Julian reflects on the youngsters who he grew up with, who didn't go to university, but instead secured much-prized British Steel apprenticeships. ""Without the steelworks, they won't get those apprenticeships,"" he says. ""They'll either be stuck in Scunthorpe because they haven't got those skills, or they will have to look elsewhere, and you'll have this exodus of young people. ""It sounds cheesy, but they are the future of society. ""Without all those young people, what's going to happen to Scunthorpe?""

What jobs do UK workers actually do?,"The UK is gearing up for another election, which means politicians of all parties fighting for the votes of what they call ""ordinary"" or ""hard-working"" people. There are record numbers of people in work in the UK, although concerns have been raised about the quality of their employment and pay levels. So, what jobs do we do in Britain, and what might be on workers' minds? When politicians want to appeal to working people, they tend to don hard hats and head to factories or construction sites. These workplaces may look good in pictures, but they do not chime with most people's experience of work. Fewer than one in 10 people work in manufacturing, and even fewer in construction. In contrast, more than eight out of 10 people work in service industries. This covers everything from bank workers to plumbers and restaurant staff - the businesses that provide work for customers, but which don't manufacture things. These service sector jobs have grown over time: 25 years ago they made up three-quarters of employment. Many of these jobs have been in public administration, education and health. Not all service sector jobs are growing though. The recentwoes of the retail sector have been well documented, but its share of the overall workforce has been shrinking since 2003. The world of work may once have been a man's world, but that is no longer the case. At the start of the 1970s, a little over one-third of workers were women. But rapid growth in female employment during the 1970s and 1980s means that women now make up almost half of the workforce. However, there are still big challenges in terms of how men and women experience work, like the enduringgender pay gap- which is about 17% for all employees and 9% among full-time staff. Nonetheless, rising female employment has been one of the key drivers of improvements in living standards over the past 50 years. More recently, the workforce has also grown older. Nearly one in three people in work is now aged 50 and over, compared to just over one in five back in 1992. This trend is being driven byrising life expectancy,the progress of the large baby boomer generation through their careers and policy changes like theincreasing state pension age. The changing nature of work - and the jobs people do to make ends meet - has become an increasingly important issue. Over the last decade, we've heard a lot about the rise of zero-hours contracts, and the emerging gig economy. The term is often used to describe short-term casual work, although there is some disagreement about exactly what it means and the number of jobs it includes. However, what is clear is that ways of working that might be thought of as less traditional have increased. In the UK, there are nearlyfive million self-employed people,from highly-paid management consultants to delivery drivers - an increase of more than 50% since the turn of the millennium. In addition, there are 870,000 workers on zero-hours contracts, 770,000 agency workers and 1.5 million temporary workers. These forms of employment grew markedly in the mid-2010s. But their share of the labour market has fallen slightly since then, as Britain's employment rate has risen. It may be that firms have had to improve work conditions - for example by offering permanent, fixed-hours contracts - as they find it harder to recruit. But these falls have been small, suggesting this type of working isn't going anywhere. Although the world of work is evolving, it is still the case that most people have what might be called traditional jobs. Nearly two-thirds of people in work have full-time roles for an employer - a proportion that has fallen only slightly since the early 1990s. But what constitutes a day's work has changed over time. For the past 150 years, we have consistently chosen to work less, as average hourly pay has risen. The average working week is now 32 hours long, down from 56 a century ago. But, since the 2007-8 financial crisis, our working week has stopped shrinking, possibly because wage stagnation has meant that workers are keen to make extra cash. For most people, living standards are determined by whether they have a job - and how much they get paid. For the lowest-paid workers, the introduction of the National Minimum Wage in 1999 set a minimum hourly rate for the first time. It has since risen faster than both inflation and average earnings. As a result, hourly pay for the lowest earners has risen nearly twice as fast as average pay over the past 20 years. The National Living Wage - the higher wage floor for workers aged 25 and over -has taken the minimum wage to new heights. Britain has experienced an unprecedented pay squeeze over the past decade. But in 2019 the picture has been more positive, with real pay growth approaching its pre-crisis average of about 2% a year. Average paylooks set to finally surpass its August 2007 peak,externallater this year. Some groups are still in the middle of a pay downturn. They include thirty-somethings, many of whom entered the labour market at the height of the financial crisis, along with public sector workers and those in the south-east. The possible return to ""peak pay"" is an important living standards milestone. But had pay consistently grown at 2% per year, rather than getting stuck in a 12-year downturn, then the average weekly salary today would be Â£138 higher.

New uncertainty in Spain as right makes gains,"Socialist leader Pedro SÃ¡nchez hails victory, despite again failing to win a majority government Spain's governing Socialists (PSOE) won the most seats in Sunday's election, but fell short of a majority - and right-wing parties made major gains. The conservative Popular Party (PP) came in second, and far-right Vox more than doubled its seats to become the country's third most-powerful party. This is Spain's fourth general election in as many years. A previous vote in April ended with no clear majority, and the Socialists failed to form a coalition government. How the far-right Vox party found its footing This time, the Socialist party won 120 of the 350 seats - three fewer than in April's vote. The PP has 88 seats, up from 66 in the previous poll, while Vox has 52 - up from just 24 in April. One of the main issues in Sunday's vote was the increasing tensions with Catalonia, Spain's semi-autonomous north-eastern region whose failed bid for independence in 2017 sparked the country's biggest political crisis for 40 years. Catalonia crisis in 300 words Protesters block the AP-7 motorway at the Spanish-French border in northern Spain On Monday, hundreds of Catalan separatist demonstrators blocked traffic in both directions on the AP-7 motorway connecting Spain with France in a protest against the jailing of separatist leaders from Spain's Catalonia region last month. Addressing Socialist supporters after the results came in, acting Prime Minister Pedro SÃ¡nchez said it was his priority to ""form a stable government and do politics for the benefit of the majority of Spaniards"". Who's who in race to run Spain ""I would like to make a call to all the political parties because they need to act with generosity and responsibility in order to unblock the political situation in Spain,"" he added. After failing to form a government, Mr SÃ¡nchez had hoped that calling another election would strengthen his party's hand - but Pablo Iglesias, leader of left-wing Podemos, warned that it had only reinforced the far right. Pablo Iglesias warned that this election had only strengthened right wing and far-right parties ""Once again we extend a hand to the Socialist party and Pedro SÃ¡nchez,"" he said, adding that he was ready to start talks with the party as soon as Monday. Podemos is the Socialist party's natural political ally. However, a coalition between the two would still fall short of the 176 seats needed for a majority. Meanwhile the centre-right party Ciudadanos - or Citizens - haemorrhaged support, winning only 10 seats this month compared to 57 in April. Ciudadanos was also overtaken by ERC-Sobiranistes, an electoral coalition of pro-Catalan separatist parties. Albert Rivera, leader of Ciudadanos, said: ""Spaniards have wanted more SÃ¡nchez for this legislature, but Spaniards have also wanted more Vox and less of the political centre."" Vox is thought to have benefited at the ballot box from the Catalan crisis, and strong anti-separatist sentiment in other regions of Spain. ""Today a patriotic alternative and a social alternative has been consolidated in Spain that demands national unity and the restoration of constitutional order in Catalonia,"" Vox leader Santiago Abascal told crowds after the election. Guy Hedgecoe, Madrid Although Pedro SÃ¡nchez's Socialists have emerged as winners having suffered only slight losses in this election, the overall result is not a positive one for the acting prime minister. With Podemos having lost some ground and MÃ¡s PaÃ­s securing only a handful of seats, there is no clear left-wing majority. The Socialists' arch-rivals on the right, the PP, has recovered many of the seats it lost in April's ballot. If the country's longstanding political stalemate is to be broken, Mr SÃ¡nchez might have to seek the support of the PP, or else a third election in the space of one year could beckon. Meanwhile, the huge surge by Vox means it will now find it easier to set the agenda on the right. That is likely to hinder any attempts by Mr SÃ¡nchez to seek a conciliatory solution to the Catalan crisis. The April election ended in deadlock, with parties failing to form a coalition by a September deadline, thus forcing Sunday's election. To form a coalition now, they would need to form alliances with smaller, nationalist parties, analysts suggest. Meanwhile, the PP and Vox could seek to make the most of their gains. One PP politician said Prime Minister SÃ¡nchez should ""start to think about going"", given the early results. The huge surge in seats for Vox will be one of the biggest talking points of the night.

Breaking|Breaking newsBrexit Party won't stand in Tory seats - Farage,"This video can not be played Farage: ""The Brexit Party will not contest 317 seats"" Nigel Farage has ditched plans to take on the Tories in more than 300 seats, after what he said was Boris Johnson's ""shift of position"" on Brexit. The Brexit Party leader had planned to run candidates in 600 seats after Mr Johnson rejected his offer of a ""Leave alliance"" to deliver Brexit. But he has been under pressure not to split the pro-Brexit vote. The party will not now stand in 317 seats won by the Tories in 2017, but will continue to stand elsewhere. Mr Farage said his party would focus its efforts on trying to take seats held by Labour, whom he accused of ""betraying"" its Leave-supporting voters. LIVE: Farage 'giving Johnson half a chance' Lib Dems, Greens and Plaid agree election pact What is tactical voting? The BBC's Alex Forsyth said some Brexit Party candidates had expressed concern about Mr Farage's plan to stand against the Tories in 600 constituencies, fearing it could hand an election victory to Labour and lead to another EU referendum. The Brexit Party is less than a year old and does not have any MPs - but it was the clear winner in the UK'sEuropean elections in May, with more than 30% of the vote. Mr Johnson welcomed Mr Farage's move, calling it ""a recognition that there's only one way to get Brexit done, and that's to vote for the Conservatives"". Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said Donald Trump ""got his wish"" when Mr Farage announced his electoral strategy. He said the Brexit Party leader was offering a ""Trump alliance"" that would lead to ""Thatcherism on steroids"" and threaten the future of the NHS. The US president hadpreviously urgedMr Farage to team up with Boris Johnson, saying they would be ""an unstoppable force"". Liberal Democrat deputy leader Sir Ed Davey said Mr Farage's decision ""shows the Conservatives and the Brexit Party are now one and the same"". Mr Farage made the announcement in Labour-held Hartlepool - a top target for his party Explaining his U-turn to supporters in Hartlepool, Mr Farage said Boris Johnson had recently signalled a ""big shift of position"" in his approach to Brexit. He cited a pledge by the PM not to extend thetransition periodthat would follow the UK's departure from the EU under the terms of his Brexit deal. The period would see the UK stick to the EU rules on issues such as freedom of movement until December 2020. Mr Farage also said he was encouraged by recent commitments from Mr Johnson to seek further divergence from EU rules in a post-Brexit trade deal. He added that this was a ""huge change"" from the kind of trade pact that had been planned under former PM Theresa May. Mr Farage's decision prompted dismay among some Brexit Party candidates who had been hoping to stand in Tory-held seats next month. Neil Greaves, who had been due to stand for the party in the Essex seat of Harlow, told the PA news agency that Mr Farage had ""let Brexiteers down"". He said he planned to continue to stand in the constituency as an independent pro-Brexit candidate, and urged fellow former candidates to do the same. The party's candidate in Mansfieldtweeted,externalthat the move meant the ""opportunity to stand up for democracy"" had been ""snatched away"" from candidates. Why candidates stand down to help other parties Poll tracker: How do the parties compare? Election translator: What does it all mean? Mr Farage had previously offered to not stand candidates against the Tories in certain seats if the prime minister changed aspects of his Brexit deal. But the proposal was rejected by Boris Johnson, who said deals with ""any other party"" would ""risk putting Jeremy Corbyn into No 10"". Mr Farage said he had ""genuinely tried"" to forge a so-called ""Leave alliance"" with the Tories, but his efforts had gone nowhere. ""In a sense we now have a Leave alliance, it's just that we've done it unilaterally,"" he added. Mr Farage has already confirmed he willnot be standing himselfin the election, saying he wanted to concentrate on helping his party's candidates. Hypothetically, the decision by the Brexit Party leader makes it notionally easier for the Tories to keep seats they hold already. But it's a million miles away from giving them a clear run. Mr Farage says he will still stand candidates in Labour areas. And for the prime minister to get the majority he craves, the Tories have to take seats that are currently held by Labour, not just hold on their existing MPs. Read more from Laura. Scottish National Party leader Nicola Sturgeon said the Conservatives have ""effectively become the Brexit Party"". She added that defeating the Tories in Scotland ""will help deprive Boris Johnson's increasingly extreme and right-wing party of the majority they crave"". Anti-Brexit parties Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats have agreednot to stand against each otherin 60 seats across England and Wales. Their pact means that, in Wales, two of the parties will agree not to field a candidate, boosting the third candidate's chances of picking up the Remain vote. In England, it will simply be a two-way agreement between the Lib Dems and the Greens.

Charge over Remembrance Sunday firework disruptionPyrotechnics went off above a war memorial as hundreds of people observed the two-minute silence.,"Stuart Potts claimed he set off the fireworks to emulate the volley of shots fired at some Remembrance Day events A man who admitted ruining a Remembrance Sunday event by setting off fireworks during a two-minute silence has been jailed for 16 weeks. Stuart Potts, 38, let off two fireworks as hundreds of people observed the silence at 11:00 GMT at the cenotaph in Eccles, Salford, on Sunday. Potts set off the fireworks while sitting on a ledge of a first-floor window in a nearby disused pub. He admitted throwing a firework in public, and a public order offence. Potts of Borough Road, Salford, who has 21 previous convictions, claimed he was given the fireworks by someone else and lit them ""as a mark of respect"" to emulate the volley of shots fired at some Remembrance Day events. Sentencing him at Manchester Magistrates' Court, District Judge Mark Hadfield said he did not believe Potts' story.

British Steel to be rescued by Chinese firm,"Chinese firm Jingye says will invest Â£1.2bn in British Steel as it signed a deal to rescue the UK steelmaker. It also said it would seek to ""preserve thousands of jobs in a key foundation industry for the UK"" but did not put a number on how many would be saved. British Steel employs about 4,000 people in Scunthorpe and Teesside. It has been kept running by the government via the Official Receiver since May, when the company went into liquidation. Jingye said it anticipated making job offers ""to as many employees across the business as possible"". Group chairman Li Ganpo said it would spend Â£1.2bn over the next decade in upgrading plant and machinery, ""improving the company's environmental performance... and boosting energy efficiency to place the operations on a more competitive and sustainable footing"". It also said it would aim to identify new markets and products. Business Minister Andrea Leadsom said she had met with Jingye's chairman on Monday. ""I have been given reassurances that next to all current staff will be kept and that in the medium to longer term they are likely to want to expand the workforce"" she said. The deal will give the Chinese company control of a third of the UK's steel industry. But Ms Leadsom said: ""There aren't any national security issues with this acquisition. ""In my dealings with Jingye, I think they will show themselves to be very committed to continued and expanded production [here] in Scunthorpe and on Teesside."" Jingye will acquire the steelworks at Scunthorpe, UK steel mills and shares of FN Steel BV, British Steel France Rail SAS and TSP Engineering.  The sale also includes the shares owned by BSL in Redcar Bulk Terminal. A statement from the Official Receiver said: ""Completion of the contract is conditional on a number of matters, including gaining the necessary regulatory approvals. The parties are working together to conclude a sale as soon as reasonably practicable. ""The business will continue to trade as normal during the period between exchange and completion. Support from employees, suppliers and customers since the liquidation has been a critical factor in achieving this outcome."" One worker at British Steel in Scunthorpe told the BBC: ""It has been a big concern, nobody knew what was happening... whether they had a job, could pay the mortgages, feed the families. It is great news."" Gareth Stace, director general of industry lobby group UK Steel, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the business being bought was a ""significant asset to our country"". He said that there was a need for ""very significant investment"" in the Scunthorpe works and that was why the deal with Jingye was ""really welcome"". This video can not be played British Steel is Scunthorpe's biggest employer British Steel had previously been in rescue talks with Ataer, a subsidiary of Turkey's state military retirement scheme Oyak. Ataer said its own talks failed ""mainly due to lack of support from the key stakeholders"". What does a steel maker from Hebei province, south-west of Beijing, see in a struggling plant in Scunthorpe?  It is difficult to know, particularly when we know so little about Jingye. There is little publicly available information - certainly no set of accounts - but the organisation's Facebook page extols its rapid rise to become a big player in steel in just 20 years. On the face of it, the Chinese buyer will be interested in the products that British Steel makes that it does not. British Steel is a specialist in railway tracks, ""long  products"", a catch-all term for girders used in construction, and the high-quality steel wire used in car tyres and dozens of other industrial applications. Jingye does not appear to make the first two, so British Steel should bring it some valuable technology and new product lines. This has to be set against the need for investment at Scunthorpe. What British Steel workers will fervently hope is that the Jingye commitment is long-term and that this is not another false dawn. Mr Stace said he believed the steel industry in the UK could now compete globally and he was publishing a manifesto with ideas for change. ""But the problem we have is we have an uncompetitive business landscape in the UK. Government can change that,"" he added. ""I'm talking about energy costs, business rates, procurement - the government buying more steel from the UK - free and fair trade, and even much more support for R&D [research and development], which we are going to lose when we fall out of the EU."" He said: ""What government needs to do is give us that business landscape. We can thrive on the global market and generate highly paid, highly skilled jobs for the UK economy."" In the long term, it is believed that while Jingye Group has promised to increase production, it has also warned costs may need to be cut. Ross Murdoch, national officer for the GMB union, said: ""We were impressed with the passion and enthusiasm from the Jingye team. ""However, due diligence on this sale was completed very quickly and the devil will be in the detail."" British Steel: 'We fear for our town's future' Chinese group 'is favourite to buy British Steel' Community, a UK trade union which absorbed the old Iron & Steel Trades Confederation body, said it welcomed ""this positive step towards securing British Steel under new ownership"". ""The fact that there has been ongoing interest from both Ataer and now Jingye rightly demonstrates that potential buyers believe that British Steel can have a sustainable future."" The UK industry has been struggling for a number of years amid claims that China has been flooding the market with cheap steel. In 2016 the EU imposed tariffs of up to 73.7% on Chinese steel after an influx of cheap imports from Asia forced European manufacturers to cut jobs and lower prices. Jingye has 23,500 employees and as well as its main steel and iron making businesses, italso engages in tourism, hotels and real estate.,external It has total registered assets of 39bn yuan (Â£4.4bn). According to its website, Jingye Group ranked 217th among the top 500 enterprises in China in 2019. The firm sells its products nationwide and exports them to more than 80 countries and regions. Jingye's products have been used in major projects such as Beijing Daxing International Airport and the underground system in Shijiazhuang.

New uncertainty in Spain as right makes gainsThe ruling Socialists again fall short of a majority in the election with the far right coming third.,"Socialist leader Pedro SÃ¡nchez hails victory, despite again failing to win a majority government Spain's governing Socialists (PSOE) won the most seats in Sunday's election, but fell short of a majority - and right-wing parties made major gains. The conservative Popular Party (PP) came in second, and far-right Vox more than doubled its seats to become the country's third most-powerful party. This is Spain's fourth general election in as many years. A previous vote in April ended with no clear majority, and the Socialists failed to form a coalition government. How the far-right Vox party found its footing This time, the Socialist party won 120 of the 350 seats - three fewer than in April's vote. The PP has 88 seats, up from 66 in the previous poll, while Vox has 52 - up from just 24 in April.

BBC apologises for wrong Remembrance Day clip,"PM Boris Johnson, pictured in 2016 and again on Sunday, at separate Remembrance Day services The BBC has apologised for mistakenly running an out-of-date clip of Boris Johnson laying a wreath. It said a production error led to BBC Breakfast showing images purporting to be the prime minister attending a Remembrance Day service on Sunday, when in fact the clip was from 2016. ""This was a production mistake and we apologise for the error,"" the corporation said in a statement. Some members of the public questioned the BBC's impartiality on social media.

One Twitter user responded:,external""That begs the question, why was the production team looking into archive rather than the footage released yesterday? Was it a damage limitation expertise? Shame on you BBC, I have always defended you, loved you, am so disappointed.""

Nikki Haley says she was told to undermine Trump,"This video can not be played Nikki Haley says impeachment is the 'death penalty for public officials'. Nikki Haley, former US ambassador to the UN, has said two top White House aides encouraged her to undermine President Donald Trump. In a new book, Ms Haley says then-Chief of Staff John Kelly and then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson told her to resist some of Mr Trump's demands. They reportedly told her they were ""trying to save the country"". There was no immediate comment from Mr Tillerson. Mr Kelly said he had wanted the president to be fully informed. ""If by 'resistance' and 'stalling' she means putting a staff process in place... to ensure [Mr Trump] knew all the pros and cons of what policy decision he might be contemplating so he could make an informed decision, then guilty as charged,"" Mr Kelly told US broadcaster CBS. Mr Trump tweeted his approval of the book, writing:""Good luck Nikki!"",external Ms Haley says Mr Kelly and Mr Tillerson told her they ""weren't being subordinate, they were trying to save the country"". ""It was their decisions, not the president's, that were in the best interests of America, they said,"" she wrote in her book With All Due Respect, which was seen by the Washington Post before its release on Tuesday. Mr Tillerson, she added, told her people would die if the president were not restrained. Ms Haley, 47, said she had refused the request from Mr Kelly and Mr Tillerson, and called it ""dangerous"" and ""offensive"". ""Instead of saying that to me they should have been saying that to the president, not asking me to join them on their sidebar plan,"" she told CBS. ""It should have been - go tell the president what your differences are and quit if you don't like what he's doing. But to undermine a president... it is really a very dangerous thing and it goes against the constitution, and it goes against what the American people want. It was offensive."" How Nikki Haley shook up the UN From Trump critic to Trump envoy The former ambassador said she disagreed with the president over his handling of Russian President Vladimir Putin at a summit in Helsinki in 2017. She also wrote that his comments after the deadly white supremacist rally in Charlottesville in 2017, that there were good people on ""both sides"", had been ""hurtful and dangerous"". A counter-protester, Heather Heyer, was killed at the demonstration. But Ms Haley also said she supported a number of Mr Trump's policies that others within the administration opposed - such as his decisions to pull the US out of a nuclear deal with Iran, and to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement. In the interview with CBS, she also criticised House Democrats' moves to impeach the president, saying that impeachment is ""like the death penalty for public officials"".

"Two 'critical' after Hong Kong day of chaosA protester became the third to be shot by police, while a pro-Beijing supporter was set alight.China","This video can not be played This Hong Kong protester's shooting was livestreamed on Facebook Two people are in critical condition after another day of violent demonstrations in Hong Kong. A protester was injured on Monday morning when he was shot at close range by a police officer. He was the third person shot by police since the protests began 24 weeks ago. Later on Monday a pro-Beijing supporter was doused in flammable liquid and set alight after arguing with protesters, who are demanding greater democracy and police accountability in Hong Kong. The territory's Chief Executive Carrie Lam, speaking at a news conference on Monday evening, called the demonstrators enemies of the people. ""If there's still any wishful thinking that by escalating violence, the Hong Kong government will yield to pressure, to satisfy the so-called political demands, I'm making this statement clear and loud here: that will not happen,"" she said. There were clashes across Hong Kong on Monday between protesters and police, who fired rubber bullets and tear gas. At one point, tear gas was fired in the central business district - a rare occurrence during working hours on a weekday. Protesters built barricades in Causeway Bay The violence also prompted a warning from a senior Chinese newspaper editor at a tabloid published by the state-owned People's Daily. Addressing Hong Kong police, Hu Xijin wrote: ""You have the backing of not only the Hong Kong and Chinese people, but also Chinese soldiers and the People's Liberation Army in Hong Kong,"" Reuters news agency reported. ""They can go into Hong Kong to provide support at any time."" Monday's violence followed a weekend of vigils and protests aftera 22-year-old student protester died on Friday.Alex Chow had been in hospital since he fell from the ledge of a car park during a police operation a week ago. The protests started in June against a now-withdrawn plan to allow extradition to mainland China, but have since morphed into wider demonstrations. The shooting occurred as protesters tried to block a junction at Sai Wan Ho on the north-east of Hong Kong Island. Police confirmed that one officer ""discharged his service revolver"" and that a man was shot. Footage posted on Facebook showed the officer drawing his gun before grappling with a man at a roadblock. When another man approached wearing a face mask, the officer fired at him, hitting him in the torso. The officer fired twice more, but there were no injuries. After the shooting, footage showed the 21-year old protester lying with his eyes wide open and with blood around him. Hong Kong protests explained in 100 and 500 words Student death sparks impromptu protests Hong Kong protest leader 'attacked with hammers' He has undergone surgery and remains in a critical condition, a Hospital Authority spokesman told the BBC. The police said officers also drew firearms from their holsters in two other places. Police in Sai Wan Ho, after the shooting happened But they denied what they called ""totally false and malicious"" reports that officers were ordered to ""recklessly use their firearms"" in Monday's operations. It was the third time a police officer had shot someone with live rounds.The first incident was during protests on 1 Octoberwhen China was celebrating 70 years of communist rule. The second case was a teenage boy shot in the leg on 4 October. Stephen McDonell, BBC China correspondent, at the scene The pedestrian crossing in Sai Wan Ho, where the young protester was shot, has become a site of considerable tension. Activists have built barricades across the junction - and when riot police come they face a torrent of abuse from bystanders of all ages. Blood can still be seen on the street - and next to it graffiti reading ""we shall never surrender"". Each time the riot police leave, the demonstrators return to erect their barricades again. Hong Kong's political crisis - now in its fifth month - continues to become more violent. The unnamed man was doused in a flammable liquid after getting into a dispute with protesters in Ma On Shan, about 20km (12 miles) north of the business district. It is unclear what started the argument, news agency AFP reported. Video being shared online shows the man, who is wearing green, tell the protesters ""none of you are Chinese"". The protesters respond by telling him to ""go back to the Greater Bay Area"", which is a part of the Chinese mainland across the border from Hong Kong. Tear gas was fired in the central business district - a rare occurrence on a weekday The man was then set alight in what Chief Supt John Tse said was the ""most shocking incident"". ""The man is now admitted to hospital in critical condition and the case is under investigation by the regional crime unit of New Territories South,"" he told reporters. Most protests have taken place at weekends, but pro-democracy activists have called out all workers for a general strike on Monday. Other incidents have included: At the Chinese University, police fired rubber bullets in response to protesters throwing bricks At Hong Kong Polytechnic, police fired tear gas at a demonstration Protesters used barricades to block roads in various places, leading to long traffic jams. MTR railway stations were also targeted Police say protesters dropped ""large and heavy objects"" on roads, endangering drivers In one video circulating online, a police motorcycle seems intentionally to ram into protesters Police described the activists as ""radical protesters"", conducting ""extensive illegal acts"" and urged them to stop any actions that threatened safety and obstructed the police. Several universities have cancelled their classes for the day. Hong Kong is part of China but as a former British colonyit has some autonomy and people have more rights. The protests started in June against plans to allow extradition to the mainland - which many feared would undermine the city's freedoms. The bill was withdrawn in Septemberbut demonstrations continuedand now call for full democracy and an inquiry into police behaviour.

Two cannabis medicines approved for NHS,"Two cannabis-based medicines, used to treat epilepsy and multiple sclerosis, have been approved for use by the NHS in England. It follows new guidelines from the drugs advisory body NICE, which looked at products for several conditions. Charities have welcomed the move, although some campaigners who have been fighting for access to the drugs have said it does not go far enough. Both medicines were developed in the UK, where they are also grown. Doctors will be able to prescribe Epidyolex, for children with two types of severe epilepsy - Lennox Gastaut syndrome and Dravet syndrome - which can cause multiple seizures a day. Clinical trials have shown the oral solution, which contains cannabidiol (CBD), could reduce the number of seizures by up to 40% in some children. Medical cannabis product approved for epilepsy 'Lack of evidence' holding back cannabis medicines 'I risk criminal record to help my child' Epidyolex was approved for use in Europe in September, but in draft guidance NICE initially said it was not value for money. It costs between Â£5,000 and Â£10,000 per patient each year - but the manufacturer, GW Pharmaceuticals, has agreed a lower discounted price with the NHS. It is estimated there are 3,000 people with Dravet and 5,000 with Lennox Gastaut syndrome in England. This video can not be played Charlie's cannabis-based epilepsy medicines are not among those approved for NHS use, his father Matt Hughes explains The drug does not contain the main psychoactive component of cannabis, THC. Decisions on drug availability are devolved around the UK, but the NICE guidance should also apply in Wales and Northern Ireland.  Scotland may follow suit next year. The other treatment, Sativex, is a mouth spray that contains a mix of THC and CBD. It has been approved for treating muscle stiffness and spasms, known as spasticity, in multiple sclerosis. But doctors will not be allowed to prescribe it to treat pain. It was the first cannabis-based medicine to be licensed in the UK after clinical trials, and has been available on the NHS in Wales since 2014.  It costs around Â£2,000 a year per patient. Back then, regulators in England said it was not cost effective, but now that decision has been reversed. It should also be available in Northern Ireland. Prof Helen Cross, a consultant in paediatric neurology at Great Ormond Street Hospital, who led UK trials of Epidyolex said it was ""great news"". ""Dravet and Lennox Gastaut syndromes are both complex difficult epilepsies with limited effective treatment options and this gives patients another optionâ¦ that could make a difference to care,"" she said. This video can not be played Anthony and Tannine travel to the Netherlands to obtain cannabis oil for their child Galia Wilson, chairwoman of Dravet Syndrome UK, said: ""Many families come to us asking about the potential of cannabis-based medicines, particularly cannabidiol, and we are thrilled that one is now available on the NHS."" But not everyone is happy. Many parents of children with epilepsy are paying thousands of pounds a month for medicines imported from Europe and Canada that contain both THC and CBD. They have reported dramatic reductions in the number and severity of seizures in their children, and are furious that NICE has not approved any cannabis-based medicines for childhood epilepsy that contain both components. The campaign group, End Our Pain, said the new guidelines were a ""massive missed opportunity"". Spokeswoman Millie Hinton said: ""This restrictive guidance is condemning many patients to having to pay for life-transforming medicine privately, to go without or to consider accessing illegal and unregulated sources."" The law was changed in November 2018 to allow specialist doctors to prescribe cannabis medicines, but this has happened in only a handful of cases. Most doctors have been unwilling to write prescriptions for medicines because, unlike Epidyolex and Sativex, they have not been through randomised controlled trials. Multiple sclerosis charities also argue the guidelines from NICE do not go far enough. Genevieve Edwards, from the MS Society, said they had been campaigning for access to Sativex for years and ""it was brilliant NICE has finally listened"". However, she said the guidelines did not go far enough because no cannabis-based treatments had been recommended to treat pain - a common symptom of MS. She also added that even more people could miss out ""because Sativex would be funded by local bodies - who might not have the resource they need to prescribe it"". Ley Sander, medical director at Epilepsy Society and professor of neurology at UCL, said: ""The need for new treatment options is unquestionable and it is reassuring that the new medication has been through clinical trials and regulatory processes. ""But the time frame for these means we still cannot be certain of the long-term efficacy of  this CBD product or what its effect might be on the developing  brain.  It is important to remember that this is not a magic bullet. Like other anti-seizure medications, it is likely to work for some but not for others."" Vaughan Gething, Health Minister for Wales, said: ""I'm pleased today that Epidyolex will be made available in Wales via our New Treatment Fund, which means it will be available in no more than 60 days.""

"Nation falls silent for 100th Armistice DayThe Royal British Legion calls for a pause in our busy lives, 100 years after the first two-minute silence.","This video can not be played A two-minute silence was observed around the country The UK has fallen silent for the 101st Armistice Day since World War One to commemorate those who died in conflict. It is the centenary of the first two-minute silence, held on the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month. The Royal British Legion called on the nation to put busy lives on pause, set aside differences and remember those who risked their lives. Politicians marked the day by offeringpledges to improve the lives of UK service personneland their families.

BBC apologises for wrong Remembrance Day clip Sussexes and Cambridges reunite at Remembrance event Labour and Tories vow to help forces personnel Marking the memories of a million service personnel Ahead of this year's commemoration, the Royal British Legion called on the nation to put down digital devices to pay their respects to service personnel. Veterans and members of the public observed the silence at Edinburgh Garden of Remembrance The Last Post was played at the National Memorial Arboretum Travellers and railway workers stopped to observe the silence at London's King's Cross station In a video message, the legion said the commemoration was non-political and non-partisan. It featured 21-year-old actress Eno Mfon saying: ""You don't have to agree with the politicians, you don't have to like their decisions."" ""The two-minute silence unites us all and is as relevant today as it was 100 years ago,"" said Catherine Davies, the legion's head of remembrance.

"Speed limits for ships can have 'massive' benefitsCutting the speed of ships by 20% can benefit health, protect whales and limit warming, say campaigners.","Cutting the speed of ships has huge benefits for humans, nature and the climate, according to a new report. A 20% reduction would cut greenhouse gases but also curb pollutants that damage human health such as black carbon and nitrogen oxides. This speed limit would cut underwater noise by 66% and reduce the chances of whale collisions by 78%. UN negotiators will meet in London this week to consider proposals to curb maritime speeds. Ships, of all sorts and sizes, transport around 80% of the world's goods by volume. However they are also responsible for a significant portion of global greenhouse emissions thanks to the burning of fuel. Shipping generates roughly 3% of the global total of warming gases - that's roughly the same quantity as emitted by Germany. While shipping wasn't covered by the Paris climate agreement, last yearthe industry agreedto cut emissions by 50% by 2050 compared to 2008 levels. Amazon profits hit by rising shipping costs Climate emergency 'clear and unequivocal' Climate change alters red deer gene pool Thisnew study,external, carried out for campaign groups Seas at Risk and Transport & Environment builds on existing research that suggests that slowing down ships is a good idea if you want to curb greenhouse gases. The report though also considers a range of other impacts of a speed cut such as on air pollution and marine noise. As ships travel more slowly they burn less fuel, which means there are also savings in black carbon, sulphur and nitrogen oxides. The last two in particular have serious impacts on human health, particularly in cities and coastal areas close to shipping lanes. The report found that cutting ship speed by 20% would cut sulphur and nitrogen oxides by around 24%. There are also significant reductions in black carbon, which are tiny black particles contained in the smoke from ship exhausts. Slowing ships down would cut the amount of fuel burned Cutting black carbon helps limit climate warming in the Arctic region because when ships burn fuel in the icy northern waters, the particles often fall on snow, and restrict its ability to reflect back sunlight, which accelerates heating in the Arctic region. The study also says that a 20% cut in speed would reduce noise pollution by two thirds - while the same speed limitation would reduce the chances of a ship colliding with a whale by 78%. ""It's a massive win, win, win, win,"" said John Maggs from Seas at Risk. ""We've got a win from a climate point of view, we've got a win from a human health point of view, we've got a win for marine nature,  we've got a potential safety gain, and up to a certain point we are saving the shipping industry money. ""It is also of course by far the simplest of the regulatory options. Thanks to satellites and transponders on commercial vessels it really is quite easy to track their movements and the speed they are travelling."" Proposals to reduce the speed of ships are among the ideas that will be considered at this week's meeting of the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) in London. Experts believe that in the medium to long term, the industry will move to alternative fuels. But there is considerable pressure, including from many countries and shipping companies, for effective short term measures to curb emissions. One proposal from France would focus on oil tankers and bulk carriers but not container or cruise ships. Denmark is proposing that the industry has a goal-based standard, where it is up to the individual shipping companies as to how they meet it. Many shipping companies are in favour of slowing down. ""Slow steaming not only reduces the fuel costs but its application does not require time-consuming procedures as it can be implemented instantly, it requires no investment from ship owners, can be easily monitored and is the most efficient means of slashing CO2 emissions,"" said Ioanna Procopiou, a Greek shipping company owner. But the idea is not supported by some of the biggest names in the trade. ""Maersk remains opposed to speed limits,"" said Simon Christopher Bergulf, who is Regulatory Affairs Director with the giant Danish shipping conglomerate. ""We rather support the principle of applying power limitation measures. Focusing on power instead of speed limits will help deliver on the CO2 reduction targets set by the IMO, whilst rewarding the most efficient ships."" What gives campaigners hope is that shipping has already tried out the concept of going slow - back in 2008, during the global financial crisis, cargo ships slowed down to cut costs. With average speeds dropping by 12% this helped cut daily fuel consumption by 27%, which equated to a significant drop in emissions. Campaigners believe that whatever decision the IMO eventually comes to will involve slower steaming. ""The short term measure, whatever it is, is going to reduce ship speed,"" said John Maggs. ""We think the best way to do this most effectively is with a direct speed limit, whether we get that or not is unknown, but ships will have to slow down in the future.""

"Labour and Tories vow to help forces personnelArmistice Day pledges include a Tory vow to protect combat veterans from ""vexatious"" legal action.","This video can not be played Armed forces personnel deserve ""a proper wage"" - Thornberry The Conservatives and Labour parties will mark Armistice Day with pledges to improve the lives of UK service personnel and their families. The Tories say they would change the law to protect veterans from ""vexatious"" legal action, if they win 12 December's general election. They are also promising extra childcare for military families and a new railcard for veterans. Labour is promising improved support for forces children and better wages. And the Liberal Democrats want to waive leave to remain fees for armed forces personnel who were born outside the UK. In other election developments: The Brexit Party leader Nigel Faragehas announced his party will not stand candidatesin the 317 seats won by the Conservatives at the 2017 general election Conservative cabinet minister Michael Gove claims Labour now backs ""uncontrolled immigration"", in anarticle for the Times,external The Lib Dems areproposing a Â£10,000 fund for all adultsto pay for skills training Labour's Keith Vaz hasannounced he will not be standing for re-election, after being suspended from the Commons by its standards watchdog Labour, in a storyfirst reported by the Mirror,external, is promising to spend Â£845m a year on improving children's mental health, including a counsellor for every school It is the first time since 1923 that Armistice Day - commemorating the end of World War One - has fallen during a general election campaign. Speaking ahead of a trip to the Midlands to meet forces personnel, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: ""As we remember the ultimate sacrifice made by our brave men and women for their country just over a century ago, it is right that we renew our commitment to the soldiers, sailors, marines, airmen and veterans of today."" Mr Johnson has pledged to change the law to protect forces veterans from ""vexatious"" legal action, if the Conservatives win a majority at the election. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: ""After a decade of government cuts and outsourcing, Labour offers our armed forces real change with the pay, conditions and respect they deserve."" Mr Johnson said the party will introduce legislation to ensure the Law of Armed Conflict has primacy and that peacetime laws are not applied to service personnel on military operations. Under the proposals, the Tories would amend the Human Rights Act so it does not apply to issues - including deaths during the Troubles in Northern Ireland - that took place before it came into force in 2000. The pledge comes as six former soldiers who served in Northern Ireland during the Troubles are facing prosecution. The cases relate to the killings of two people on Bloody Sunday in Londonderry in January 1972; as well as the deaths in separate incidents of Daniel Hegarty, John Pat Cunningham; Joe McCann and Aidan McAnespie. Not all of the charges are for murder. The Public Prosecution Service in Northern Ireland has said that of 32 so-called Troubles legacy cases it has taken decisions on since 2011, 17 related to republicans, eight to loyalists, and five are connected to the Army. Boris Johnson met veterans on Monday during a visit to Wolverhampton Defence Secretary Ben Wallace told BBC Radio 4's Today programme any changes would not affect current criminal prosecutions brought against service personnel, but in future, those who wanted to pursue complaints against the forces would have to go to the European Court of Human Rights rather than UK courts. ""At the moment, because of the Human Rights Act, people can go via our courts and use our systems to constantly reopen this and we don't think that is right or fair,"" he said. But members of both the Ulster Unionist Party and Sinn FÃ©in in Northern Ireland have criticised the pledge. The UUP's Doug Beattie - a retired Army captain - said it would allow for ""terrorists... to get away scot-free"", while Sinn FÃ©in's Linda Dillon said it was ""unacceptable"" to give soldiers, past and present, ""immunity"". Irish Deputy Prime Minister Simon Coveney also said the proposal was ""very concerning"", tweeting: ""The law must apply to all, without exception, to achieve reconciliation."" Conservative plans to exempt British troops from human rights laws during combat were first announced in 2016 by Mr Johnson's predecessor, Theresa May, but they have yet to be put into law. The Tories are also promising to extend the school day for forces children aged 4 to 11, and a guaranteed job interview for any public sector role veterans apply for. The party has also announced plans for a new Veterans' Railcard offering a third off rail fares. A HM Forces Railcard can already be bought by serving personnel for Â£21 a year. This isn't the first time the Conservatives have promised to end what they've called ""vexatious legal claims and prosecutions against British soldiers accused of wrongdoing on the battlefield"" - such as allegations of abuse or unlawful killing. The past four Tory defence secretaries have all pledged to introduce legislation to protect serving personnel and veterans, but have so far failed to deliver. The thorniest issue has been what to do with killings and deaths that took place during the Troubles in Northern Ireland. The Tories now believe they might have a solution by amending the Human Rights Act so it does not apply to incidents before 2000. But recent history has shown any change will be easier said than done. Labour, meanwhile, isrestating pledges it made in June,externalfor Armed Forces Day to improve support for forces children with better access to schools and dedicated local authority admissions strategies to help with frequent school moves. The party says its plan to scrap the public sector pay cap will boost the income of the lowest paid members of the forces. According to Labour analysis, the starting salary of a private is Â£1,159 lower in real terms than in 2010. Armed forces pay was frozen to an increase of 1% between 2013 and 2017 by Conservative-led governments. The independent Armed Forces Pay Review Board recommended a 2.9% rise for 2018/19, which the government chose to implement as a 2% increase with a 0.9% one-off payment. Labour is also promising to provide ""decent housing"" for forces personnel and their families by ending the reliance on the private rented sector. Jeremy Corbyn took part in the silence in his Islington constituency Labour's shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, said it was time to pay service personnel a ""proper wage"", adding: ""We ask them to make the ultimate sacrifice. The least we can do is offer them decent pay."" She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""We are going to make sure that our armed forces are looked after properly because we don't think that they have been until now. ""And on a day a like today, I think it is very important to emphasise the priority that we will be giving to our Armed Forces, our veterans and their families."" Jeremy Corbyn has been talking about the starting pay for an army private, which has fallen after taking account of rising prices since 2010. That's the salary you get after you've been assigned to a unit and completed training. Mr Corbyn was using figures calculated before the government introduced a larger-than-usual increase in April 2019. The starting salary in 2010 was Â£17,015, which in 2019 money would be Â£20,650. The starting salary since April has been Â£20,000, so it has clearly fallen in real terms, but not by the Â£1,200 he cited. The Lib Dems said leave to remain fees - the payment made when someone born outside the UK wants to stay in the country - had been ""increased to exorbitant levels"" and ""prevented many brave veterans from taking up their right to settle in the UK with their families"". The cost is currently Â£2,389 per person, and the party has pledged to scrap that for veterans. The Lib Dem's defence spokesman, Jamie Stone, said: ""These men and women risk their lives in the service of our country, and the fact they are treated this way by the Conservative Party is yet another horrible example of the hostile environment. ""A Liberal Democrat government will waive the outrageous application fees for members of the armed forces on discharge and their families.""

Airlines accused of climate change hypocrisy,"British Airways has launched a review into a money-saving practice which increases its greenhouse gas emissions. It follows a BBC investigation exposing ""fuel tankering"" by airlines - in which planes are filled with extra fuel, usually to avoid paying higher prices for refuelling at destination airports. The industry-wide practice could mean extra annual emissions equivalent to those of a large European town. BA now says that using tankering to cut costs ""may be the wrong thing to do"". However, the airline added that it also uses the practice for safety and operational reasons, including helping planes to turn around quickly. BBC Panorama has discovered the airline's planes generated an extra 18,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide last year through fuel tankering. Cost savings made on a single flight can be as small as just over Â£10 - though savings can run to hundreds of pounds. Researchers have estimated that one in five of all European airlines' flights,externalinvolves some element of fuel tankering. The practice on European routes could result in additional annual greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to that produced by a town of 100,000 people. Critics say the widespread use of the practice undermines the aviation industry's claims that it is committed to reducing its carbon emissions. John Sauven, Greenpeace UK's executive director, told the BBC that fuel tankering was a ""classic example of a company putting profit before planet"". Responding to BA's decision to carry out a review, Mr Sauven, said it showed how the airline industry had been treating climate change ""like a PR problem"". ""This is why we need government-enforced reduction targets to ensure airlines take responsibility for the damage their emissions are causing,"" he said. John Sauven called for rules and regulations to be ""tougher"" International Airlines Group (IAG), the company that owns BA, says it wants to be the world's leading airline group on sustainability. BA boasts it even prints its in-flight magazine on lighter paper to save weight. Yet BBC Panorama has seen dozens of internal BA documents that show up to six tonnes of extra fuel have been loaded onto planes in this way. It has also seen evidence that Easyjet carries extra fuel in this way. Airlines can save money from the fact that the price of aviation fuel differs between European destinations. BA insiders say the company - like many airlines running short haul routes in Europe - has computer software that calculates whether costs can be saved by fuel tankering. The software will calculate whether there is a cost saving to be made. If there is, crews load up the extra fuel. An example of documents seen by Panorama show that a recent BA flight to Italy carried nearly three tonnes of extra fuel. British Airways owner IAG says strikes cost Â£121m British Airways flights to Cairo cancelled The extra weight meant the plane emitted more than 600kg of additional carbon dioxide - the same emissions one person is responsible for on a return flight to New York. The cost saving on that trip was less than Â£40, but the documents Panorama has seen show that it can be even lower than that. IAG made an annual profit of â¬2.9bn (Â£2.6bn) in 2018, about 80% of which came from BA. A BA insider described the practice as ""hypocritical"". ""For such a big company to be trying to save such small amounts while emitting so much extra CO2 seems unjustifiable in the current climate,"" he said. In response to the claims, the chief executive of BA's parent company, IAG, announced the airline would carry out a review of the practice. On Friday, Willie Walsh told investors that the airline wanted to ensure it was not ""incentivising the wrong behaviour"" from managers. ""Because clearly the financial saving would have incentivised us to do fuel tankering,"" he said. ""But maybe... this the wrong thing to do and the wrong thing to incentive. So we want to make sure we have our incentives aligned to the right activities so ensure financial sustainability but also environmental sustainability."" This video can not be played How to reduce your carbon footprint when you fly BA said it was common practice for the airline industry to carry additional fuel on some flights. The airline said for BA this applies mainly to short-haul destinations ""where there are considerable price differences between European airports"". It said the additional emissions from the airline represented approximately 2% of the total extra emissions generated by all airlines tankering fuel in Europe, based on research by Eurocontrol. BA pointed out that since 2012 all flights within Europe had been covered by the EU Emissions Trading System. It added that from 2020 the company would offset all CO2 emissions from its UK domestic flights. Easyjet said it had reduced the level of tankering in recent years and that it only took place on a tiny proportion of flights for operational and commercial reasons. Eurocontrol, the body which coordinates air traffic control for Europe, has calculated that tankering in Europe resulted in 286,000 tonnes of extra fuel being burnt every year, and the emission of an additional 901,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide. It calculates that the practice saved airlines a total of â¬265m (Â£228m) a year. Eurocontrol described the practice as ""questionable"" at a time when aviation is being challenged for its contribution to climate change.

Shop worker: 'I am verbally abused every day',"STOCK PICTURE: Many shop workers suffer threats and even assaults from customers, says Usdaw Jackie McKenzie, 56, has worked at a supermarket petrol station in Bathgate, Scotland for the last 20 years. During that time, the amount of abuse she has faced while doing her job has been rising. ""I've been verbally abused on a daily basis,"" she said. ""It's getting a bit out of hand to be honest."" She is not alone, according to a new survey, which has found that retail staff are abused, threatened or assaulted on average 21 times a year. A survey of over 4,000 retail staff by shop workers' union Usdaw, found that around two-thirds have experienced verbal abuse, while 41% were threatened by a customer and nearly 5% were assaulted. The trade union has been campaigning to stop abusive behaviour towards retail staff for a number of years andin June called on the government to tackle the problem. Violent retail crime leading to PTSD for shop staff, report says 'I've been spat on, bitten and kicked' 'They took Â£150 from the till - was it really worth it?' ""People think that just because we work behind a till there's no reason to respect us,"" said Michelle Whitehead, 46, a convenience store worker in Wolverhampton. ""It's terrible to say but you get used to being threatened. When someone comes and shouts at you it does affect you. Sometimes you have to walk away from the counter and count till 10 so you don't burst into tears."" Ms Whitehead, who has been a retail worker for almost three decades, says that incidents used to occur once in a while but now she receives abuse from customers on a weekly basis. She said she often encounters difficulties when dealing with young people who are underage but seeking to purchase alcohol or cigarettes. She has also been spat at for refusing to hand over parcels from the post office counter without proof of ID. Retail worker Michelle Whitehead says that no one intervenes when customers shout at her Although neither Ms Whitehead or Ms McKenzie have been assaulted, they have witnessed violent attacks. Ms McKenzie said one night, while managing the shop on her own, she witnessed a young man run into the convenience store begging for help and a minute later, another boy had run in and started beating him up. ""I shouted to him to stop from behind the counter and pressed the panic button, and the police did come. But by that time the guy had a broken arm and a broken jaw, and the shop was trashed,"" she said. The two workers are campaigning for retailers and the government to make changes so retail staff can feel safe while they are at work. They want signs up in stores telling customers to respect staff, more police on patrol and for retailers to impose a life-time ban on customers who persistently abuse shop workers. Abusive customers should also have to face criminal charges, they said. ""If that's the only corner shop you can go to, it might make you think if you could have a life-time ban,"" said Ms Whitehead.

""We've got a win from a climate point of view, we've got a win from a human health point of view, we've got a win for marine nature,  we've got a potential safety gain, and up to a certain point we are saving the shipping industry money. ""It is also of course by far the simplest of the regulatory options. Thanks to satellites and transponders on commercial vessels it really is quite easy to track their movements and the speed they are travelling."" Proposals to reduce the speed of ships are among the ideas that will be considered at this week's meeting of the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) in London. Experts believe that in the medium to long term, the industry will move to alternative fuels. But there is considerable pressure, including from many countries and shipping companies, for effective short term measures to curb emissions. One proposal from France would focus on oil tankers and bulk carriers but not container or cruise ships. Denmark is proposing that the industry has a goal-based standard, where it is up to the individual shipping companies as to how they meet it. Many shipping companies are in favour of slowing down. ""Slow steaming not only reduces the fuel costs but its application does not require time-consuming procedures as it can be implemented instantly, it requires no investment from ship owners, can be easily monitored and is the most efficient means of slashing CO2 emissions,"" said Ioanna Procopiou, a Greek shipping company owner. But the idea is not supported by some of the biggest names in the trade. ""Maersk remains opposed to speed limits,"" said Simon Christopher Bergulf, who is Regulatory Affairs Director with the giant Danish shipping conglomerate. ""We rather support the principle of applying power limitation measures. Focusing on power instead of speed limits will help deliver on the CO2 reduction targets set by the IMO, whilst rewarding the most efficient ships."" What gives campaigners hope is that shipping has already tried out the concept of going slow - back in 2008, during the global financial crisis, cargo ships slowed down to cut costs. With average speeds dropping by 12% this helped cut daily fuel consumption by 27%, which equated to a significant drop in emissions. Campaigners believe that whatever decision the IMO eventually comes to will involve slower steaming. ""The short term measure, whatever it is, is going to reduce ship speed,"" said John Maggs. ""We think the best way to do this most effectively is with a direct speed limit, whether we get that or not is unknown, but ships will have to slow down in the future.""

Labour and Tories vow to help forces personnel,"This video can not be played Armed forces personnel deserve ""a proper wage"" - Thornberry The Conservatives and Labour parties will mark Armistice Day with pledges to improve the lives of UK service personnel and their families. The Tories say they would change the law to protect veterans from ""vexatious"" legal action, if they win 12 December's general election. They are also promising extra childcare for military families and a new railcard for veterans. Labour is promising improved support for forces children and better wages. And the Liberal Democrats want to waive leave to remain fees for armed forces personnel who were born outside the UK. In other election developments: The Brexit Party leader Nigel Faragehas announced his party will not stand candidatesin the 317 seats won by the Conservatives at the 2017 general election Conservative cabinet minister Michael Gove claims Labour now backs ""uncontrolled immigration"", in anarticle for the Times,external The Lib Dems areproposing a Â£10,000 fund for all adultsto pay for skills training Labour's Keith Vaz hasannounced he will not be standing for re-election, after being suspended from the Commons by its standards watchdog Labour, in a storyfirst reported by the Mirror,external, is promising to spend Â£845m a year on improving children's mental health, including a counsellor for every school It is the first time since 1923 that Armistice Day - commemorating the end of World War One - has fallen during a general election campaign. Speaking ahead of a trip to the Midlands to meet forces personnel, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: ""As we remember the ultimate sacrifice made by our brave men and women for their country just over a century ago, it is right that we renew our commitment to the soldiers, sailors, marines, airmen and veterans of today."" Mr Johnson has pledged to change the law to protect forces veterans from ""vexatious"" legal action, if the Conservatives win a majority at the election. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: ""After a decade of government cuts and outsourcing, Labour offers our armed forces real change with the pay, conditions and respect they deserve."" Mr Johnson said the party will introduce legislation to ensure the Law of Armed Conflict has primacy and that peacetime laws are not applied to service personnel on military operations. Under the proposals, the Tories would amend the Human Rights Act so it does not apply to issues - including deaths during the Troubles in Northern Ireland - that took place before it came into force in 2000. The pledge comes as six former soldiers who served in Northern Ireland during the Troubles are facing prosecution. The cases relate to the killings of two people on Bloody Sunday in Londonderry in January 1972; as well as the deaths in separate incidents of Daniel Hegarty, John Pat Cunningham; Joe McCann and Aidan McAnespie. Not all of the charges are for murder. The Public Prosecution Service in Northern Ireland has said that of 32 so-called Troubles legacy cases it has taken decisions on since 2011, 17 related to republicans, eight to loyalists, and five are connected to the Army. Boris Johnson met veterans on Monday during a visit to Wolverhampton Defence Secretary Ben Wallace told BBC Radio 4's Today programme any changes would not affect current criminal prosecutions brought against service personnel, but in future, those who wanted to pursue complaints against the forces would have to go to the European Court of Human Rights rather than UK courts. ""At the moment, because of the Human Rights Act, people can go via our courts and use our systems to constantly reopen this and we don't think that is right or fair,"" he said. But members of both the Ulster Unionist Party and Sinn FÃ©in in Northern Ireland have criticised the pledge. The UUP's Doug Beattie - a retired Army captain - said it would allow for ""terrorists... to get away scot-free"", while Sinn FÃ©in's Linda Dillon said it was ""unacceptable"" to give soldiers, past and present, ""immunity"". Irish Deputy Prime Minister Simon Coveney also said the proposal was ""very concerning"", tweeting: ""The law must apply to all, without exception, to achieve reconciliation."" Conservative plans to exempt British troops from human rights laws during combat were first announced in 2016 by Mr Johnson's predecessor, Theresa May, but they have yet to be put into law. The Tories are also promising to extend the school day for forces children aged 4 to 11, and a guaranteed job interview for any public sector role veterans apply for. The party has also announced plans for a new Veterans' Railcard offering a third off rail fares. A HM Forces Railcard can already be bought by serving personnel for Â£21 a year. This isn't the first time the Conservatives have promised to end what they've called ""vexatious legal claims and prosecutions against British soldiers accused of wrongdoing on the battlefield"" - such as allegations of abuse or unlawful killing. The past four Tory defence secretaries have all pledged to introduce legislation to protect serving personnel and veterans, but have so far failed to deliver. The thorniest issue has been what to do with killings and deaths that took place during the Troubles in Northern Ireland. The Tories now believe they might have a solution by amending the Human Rights Act so it does not apply to incidents before 2000. But recent history has shown any change will be easier said than done. Labour, meanwhile, isrestating pledges it made in June,externalfor Armed Forces Day to improve support for forces children with better access to schools and dedicated local authority admissions strategies to help with frequent school moves. The party says its plan to scrap the public sector pay cap will boost the income of the lowest paid members of the forces. According to Labour analysis, the starting salary of a private is Â£1,159 lower in real terms than in 2010. Armed forces pay was frozen to an increase of 1% between 2013 and 2017 by Conservative-led governments. The independent Armed Forces Pay Review Board recommended a 2.9% rise for 2018/19, which the government chose to implement as a 2% increase with a 0.9% one-off payment. Labour is also promising to provide ""decent housing"" for forces personnel and their families by ending the reliance on the private rented sector. Jeremy Corbyn took part in the silence in his Islington constituency Labour's shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, said it was time to pay service personnel a ""proper wage"", adding: ""We ask them to make the ultimate sacrifice. The least we can do is offer them decent pay."" She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""We are going to make sure that our armed forces are looked after properly because we don't think that they have been until now. ""And on a day a like today, I think it is very important to emphasise the priority that we will be giving to our Armed Forces, our veterans and their families."" Jeremy Corbyn has been talking about the starting pay for an army private, which has fallen after taking account of rising prices since 2010. That's the salary you get after you've been assigned to a unit and completed training. Mr Corbyn was using figures calculated before the government introduced a larger-than-usual increase in April 2019. The starting salary in 2010 was Â£17,015, which in 2019 money would be Â£20,650. The starting salary since April has been Â£20,000, so it has clearly fallen in real terms, but not by the Â£1,200 he cited. The Lib Dems said leave to remain fees - the payment made when someone born outside the UK wants to stay in the country - had been ""increased to exorbitant levels"" and ""prevented many brave veterans from taking up their right to settle in the UK with their families"". The cost is currently Â£2,389 per person, and the party has pledged to scrap that for veterans. The Lib Dem's defence spokesman, Jamie Stone, said: ""These men and women risk their lives in the service of our country, and the fact they are treated this way by the Conservative Party is yet another horrible example of the hostile environment. ""A Liberal Democrat government will waive the outrageous application fees for members of the armed forces on discharge and their families.""

Airlines accused of climate change hypocrisyA British Airways insider says the industry deliberately fills planes with extra fuel to cut costs.Science & Environment,"British Airways has launched a review into a money-saving practice which increases its greenhouse gas emissions. It follows a BBC investigation exposing ""fuel tankering"" by airlines - in which planes are filled with extra fuel, usually to avoid paying higher prices for refuelling at destination airports. The industry-wide practice could mean extra annual emissions equivalent to those of a large European town. BA now says that using tankering to cut costs ""may be the wrong thing to do"". However, the airline added that it also uses the practice for safety and operational reasons, including helping planes to turn around quickly. BBC Panorama has discovered the airline's planes generated an extra 18,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide last year through fuel tankering. Cost savings made on a single flight can be as small as just over Â£10 - though savings can run to hundreds of pounds. Researchers have estimated that one in five of all European airlines' flights,externalinvolves some element of fuel tankering. The practice on European routes could result in additional annual greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to that produced by a town of 100,000 people. Critics say the widespread use of the practice undermines the aviation industry's claims that it is committed to reducing its carbon emissions. John Sauven, Greenpeace UK's executive director, told the BBC that fuel tankering was a ""classic example of a company putting profit before planet"". Responding to BA's decision to carry out a review, Mr Sauven, said it showed how the airline industry had been treating climate change ""like a PR problem"". ""This is why we need government-enforced reduction targets to ensure airlines take responsibility for the damage their emissions are causing,"" he said. John Sauven called for rules and regulations to be ""tougher"" International Airlines Group (IAG), the company that owns BA, says it wants to be the world's leading airline group on sustainability. BA boasts it even prints its in-flight magazine on lighter paper to save weight. Yet BBC Panorama has seen dozens of internal BA documents that show up to six tonnes of extra fuel have been loaded onto planes in this way. It has also seen evidence that Easyjet carries extra fuel in this way. Airlines can save money from the fact that the price of aviation fuel differs between European destinations. BA insiders say the company - like many airlines running short haul routes in Europe - has computer software that calculates whether costs can be saved by fuel tankering. The software will calculate whether there is a cost saving to be made. If there is, crews load up the extra fuel. An example of documents seen by Panorama show that a recent BA flight to Italy carried nearly three tonnes of extra fuel. British Airways owner IAG says strikes cost Â£121m British Airways flights to Cairo cancelled The extra weight meant the plane emitted more than 600kg of additional carbon dioxide - the same emissions one person is responsible for on a return flight to New York. The cost saving on that trip was less than Â£40, but the documents Panorama has seen show that it can be even lower than that. IAG made an annual profit of â¬2.9bn (Â£2.6bn) in 2018, about 80% of which came from BA. A BA insider described the practice as ""hypocritical"". ""For such a big company to be trying to save such small amounts while emitting so much extra CO2 seems unjustifiable in the current climate,"" he said. In response to the claims, the chief executive of BA's parent company, IAG, announced the airline would carry out a review of the practice. On Friday, Willie Walsh told investors that the airline wanted to ensure it was not ""incentivising the wrong behaviour"" from managers. ""Because clearly the financial saving would have incentivised us to do fuel tankering,"" he said. ""But maybe... this the wrong thing to do and the wrong thing to incentive. So we want to make sure we have our incentives aligned to the right activities so ensure financial sustainability but also environmental sustainability."" This video can not be played How to reduce your carbon footprint when you fly BA said it was common practice for the airline industry to carry additional fuel on some flights. The airline said for BA this applies mainly to short-haul destinations ""where there are considerable price differences between European airports"". It said the additional emissions from the airline represented approximately 2% of the total extra emissions generated by all airlines tankering fuel in Europe, based on research by Eurocontrol. BA pointed out that since 2012 all flights within Europe had been covered by the EU Emissions Trading System. It added that from 2020 the company would offset all CO2 emissions from its UK domestic flights. Easyjet said it had reduced the level of tankering in recent years and that it only took place on a tiny proportion of flights for operational and commercial reasons. Eurocontrol, the body which coordinates air traffic control for Europe, has calculated that tankering in Europe resulted in 286,000 tonnes of extra fuel being burnt every year, and the emission of an additional 901,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide. It calculates that the practice saved airlines a total of â¬265m (Â£228m) a year. Eurocontrol described the practice as ""questionable"" at a time when aviation is being challenged for its contribution to climate change.

Lib Dems propose Â£10k 'skills wallet',"The Lib Dems' Sam Gyimah promoted his party's policy during a visit to a tech start-up firm in north London The Lib Dems are proposing a Â£10,000 grant for every adult in England to put towards education and training. The money would go into a ""skills wallet"" over a period of 30 years, to help with the cost of approved courses. The party says it would pay for the policy by reversing government cuts to corporation tax - returning the business levy to its 2016 rate of 20%. The pledge comes at the start of a second week of campaigning ahead of the general election on 12 December. Labour and the Conservatives are also expected to announce policies to boost lifelong learning. Does cutting corporation tax always raise more money? Conservatives pledge to boost GP numbers This must be the climate election - Greens Labourhas proposed a National Education Service, which would be ""free at the point of use"" and ""open to all regardless of age, background or circumstance"". The Conservatives have a range of initiatives, including arecently-launched National Retraining Scheme, which is aimed at helping adults whose jobs are at risk from automation. The Lib Dem plan - which would only apply to England as education is devolved to the other nations - would: Put Â£4,000 into people's Skills Wallet at the age of 25 Add another Â£3,000 at 40 And another Â£3,000 will be put in at 55 The current cost of tuition fees in England for a university course is up to Â£9,250 per year. The party hopes people will then be encouraged to add to the pot, and save more towards the cost of education and training. Employers and local government will also be able to contribute to the wallets, and free careers advice will be given to people to decide how best to use the funding. However, the courses will have to be regulated and monitored by the Office for Students. Lib Dem business spokesman Sam Gyimah said: ""In an ever changing workplace people often need to develop new skills, but the cost of courses and qualifications shuts too many people out."" He said his party would ""create a new era of learning"" for adults through the plan, and ""empower people to develop new skills so that they can thrive in the technologies and industries that are key to the UK's economic future and prosperity"". The policy would have to first go through a consultation process and would not come into force until 2021-22. Participation in government-funded adult further education fell by 3.5% in the first two quarters of 2018-19 on last year's equivalent figures.

More rain due as flood disruption continues,"One villager said Fishlake ""has not been flooded for 100 years"" Residents of a heavily flooded village in Yorkshire fear conditions could get worse as more rain is forecast. The Environment Agency has 39 flood warnings in place across the country, including five severe warnings on the River Don in South Yorkshire. About 400 homes have been flooded in the North, and 1,200 properties have been evacuated, the agency said. Boris Johnson has called a meeting to discuss the government's response after criticism from Jeremy Corbyn. Doncaster Council has called for people to evacuate the village of Fishlake, near Doncaster, saying it ""can only offer dedicated support to people who are not in an area where there is a threat to life"". But farmers say they are unable to leave as they need to care for their livestock. Community rallies to help flood-hit villagers A yellow warning for rain remains in place over parts of Yorkshire and the East Midlands for Monday, Tuesday and Thursday. An emergency appeal to support ""displaced"" families has raised almost Â£50,000. Four Environment Agency pumps are now in operation in Fishlake to pump out floodwater from the village. Doncaster Council said it is ""still an emergency situation"" with five areas in the borough under a severe flood warning, meaning a ""significant risk to life"". The authority said the previous evacuation advice still stands for all areas. Twelve flood warnings remain in Lincolnshire where more than 1,000 acres have been flooded by Barlings Eau and some farms are cut off. This video can not be played A Lincolnshire farmer cut off by floodwater talks about his frustrations Jeremy Corbyn has written to Prime Minister Boris Johnson urging him to take greater action over the flooding and criticising him for not declaring a national emergency. ""If this had happened in Surrey, not Yorkshire or the East Midlands, it seems far more likely that a national emergency would have been declared,"" he said. The prime minister said he will chair an emergency Cobra meeting on Tuesday to discuss the government's response to the flooding. Pam Webb said she was devastated by the impact of the floods Pam Webb, who owns a spa in Fishlake, said she bought her property in 2004 and had surveys done at the time. ""There was nothing of any concern raised, Fishlake hadn't flooded in 100 years,"" she said. ""We need to now establish why and how and who should be accountable. ""Is it the flood defences that weren't sufficient to hold it? Did something give at some other point?"" A funeral parlour in Fishlake was hit by flooding Ms Webb said she had just found out her insurance would not cover the damage because of a flood exemption on the policy. ""It's my home and my business,"" she said. ""I work with a great team of girls and that's their livelihoods affected and my own as well."" The village church is collecting food to distribute to residents and roast dinners were delivered on Sunday to those who had remained in their homes. Empty coffins were seen floating inside the workshop of a flooded funeral parlour in the village. Farmer Robert Robinson called for the River Don to be dredged Tractors and boats have been used to get around the village, with many roadsin the area under floodwater. Military helicoptershave been used,externalto help boost flood defences in the area. The Environment Agency called in an RAF Chinook late on Sunday to move 40 tonnes of aggregate from a quarry to bolster drainage channels east of Bentley Farmer Robert Robinson said: ""My whole farm is just covered in water. We've animals that are suffering because of the water and we can't get in and out without tractors. ""We desperately need the River Don to be dredged and cleaned out, it's there to transport water and it's not doing its job properly."" Stephen Gilleard, another farmer from the village, said: ""You learn to live with nature and, as a farmer, you deal with things but you can't deal with this. ""There's a lot of volume of water here to move, we've still not got no pumps in place starting to get rid of any of it, it's a bad forecast for Thursday, more rain to come, and, unless we move some of this water, there's no room for any more."" Adrian Gill, a flood manager with the Environment Agency, said it did not currently dredge the River Don ""because we don't think that's the right thing to do"" but the situation could be reviewed in the future. A flooded field 100m from the River Don on the outskirts of Kirk Bramwith in South Yorkshire Many parts of Fishlake remain under 3ft (1m) of water Some train lines remain blocked by high water. Northern saidits services into Rotherham Central,externalwere not running until further notice, with reduced services between Doncaster and Sheffield. CrossCountry's trains are beingdiverted away from Doncaster,external. Doncaster Council saida number of roads,externalremained closed. According to the Salvation Army, some people have been rescued from their homes by boat since the early hours of Saturday, but others remain in their properties. Rescuers used boats to reach people trapped in Rotherham One woman said she had no insurance to cover the cost of damage to her home in Bentley, near Doncaster, after it flooded over the weekend. April Wingfield, who had to be rescued from her home by boat, said: ""I'm devastated, I'm just going to have to start from scratch."" She said the situation was worse than in 2007, when 2,200 properties were flooded across Sheffield withdamage estimated at Â£400min the Lower Don Valley alone. The RSPCA has been involved in a rescue operation to save 60 swans following an oil spillage caused by flooding in Rotherham. Further south, parts of Derbyshire are still affected by flooding. Areas around Matlock - where former High Sherriff of DerbyshireAnnie Hall was swept to her deathby the flooded River Derwent - are continuing their clean-up efforts, with further rain over the weekend leaving standing water along a number of roads.

"UK growth slowest in almost a decade, says ONS","Britain's economy has grown at the slowest annual rate in almost a decade, according to official figures. Year-on-year growth in the three months to end-September slowed to 1% from 1.3% in the second quarter, the Office for National Statistics said. An ONS spokesman said: ""Looking at the picture over the last year, growth slowed to its lowest rate in almost a decade."" But the economy avoided a recession by growing 0.3% in the third quarter. The economy had shrunk in the second quarter and two quarters of contraction would have signalled a recession. Despite the economy expanding by 0.3% in the third quarter, it was not as fast as the 0.4% forecast by economists, including at the Bank of England. A statistician at the ONS said GDP grew ""steadily"" in the third quarter. That was largely as a result of a ""strong July"". ""The underlying trade deficit narrowed, mainly due to growing exports of both goods and services."" In the month of September, GDP fell by 0.1%, as had been expected. But the ONS revised down the contraction in August to 0.2% from 0.1%. It was the growth of 0.3% in July that drove the economy in the whole of the third quarter. John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC, said: ""The fact that growth was positive in the third quarter was largely due to a strong July. ""Output then fell back in August and September, which points to a lack of momentum in the economy going into the fourth quarter."" The statistician at the ONS said: ""Services again led the way, with construction also performing well. ""Manufacturing failed to grow, as falls in many industries were offset by car production bouncing back following April shutdowns."" The ONS said the construction sector showed its first positive growth for a rolling three-month period since May. Production was flat in the three months to September and has not shown growth over a rolling three-month period since April. Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), said: ""The dominant services sector was the main driver of GDP growth in the quarter with industrial production and construction sectors adding little to overall UK GDP growth."" Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics, said that while the economy avoided a recession in the third quarter, the economy was ""pretty soft"". ""The GDP figures suggest that the economy failed to regain much momentum after the the second-quarter contraction."" Tej Parikh, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, said that ""a return to growth is welcome news, but narrowly avoiding a recession is nothing to celebrate"". ""The UK economy has been in stop-start mode all year, with growth punctuated by the various Brexit deadlines,"" he added. Ms Gregory added: ""While the election is just under five weeks away, clearly this isn't the good news the government might have hoped for."" The economyhad unexpectedly contracted by 0.2% in the second quarter- the March to June period - when Brexit stockpiles were unwound after the first Brexit date of 29 March. Samuel Tombs, economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said a ""renewed stockpiling boost"" failed to materalise in the third quarter. ""It possible that stockpiling occurred to a greater extent at the start of the fourth quarter,"" he said, adding fourth-quarter growth might not be depressed to the extent he expected. But Mr Parikh said that ""the final quarter of 2019 could be weaker as stockpiles continue to be run down"". The Chancellor, Sajid Javid, said there figures were ""another welcome sign that the fundamentals of the UK economy are strong. Under the conservatives, we've seen nine consecutive years of growth"". He added: ""What it also shows is the real risk to growth in our economy is Corbyn's Labour. If they get their way, two referendums in 2020, eye watering amounts of spending and borrowing and debt, that kind of economic vandalism will bring growth in this country to a halt."" But John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said: ""The fact that the government will be celebrating 0.1% growth in the last six months is a sign of how low their hopes and expectations for our economy are."" Ed Davey, the Liberal Democrat's deputy leader said: ""The economy under the Tories is anaemic."" As much as it would be a relief that a formal recession has been avoided, the picture is very sluggish, in keeping with what has been called a ""slow puncture"" economy. Growth of 0.3% between July and September is clearly preferable to another quarter of contraction, but still slow by normal historical standards. Indeed, comparing the third quarter this year with the same period last year, growth of just 1% is the slowest since the aftermath of the financial crisis. It is the weakest two quarters since the financial crisis. The background is a slower European and world economy reeling from trade wars. But years of damaged business investment, after the Brexit referendum, are taking their toll on growth. The latest figures in the month of September showed a contraction of 0.1%. Data has been volatile this year, with car industry shutdowns and two bouts of ultimately unneeded no-deal Brexit stockpiling. So recession avoided, but this is not the ""bounce back"" promised by some.

'Real living wage' rises in pre-Christmas pay bump,"Thousands of UK workers will enjoy a pre-Christmas pay bump if their employer is a member of the ""real living wage"" campaign. Businesses who have signed up to the voluntary scheme will lift their UK hourly rate by 30p to Â£9.30. People living in London will see their hourly pay rise by 20p to Â£10.75. The scheme is separate to the statutory National Living Wage for workers aged 25 and above which currently stands at Â£8.21 an hour. The Living Wage Foundation said its ""real"" pay rate - which applies to all employees over 18 - is calculated independently and is based on costs such as food, clothing and household bills. What is the minimum wage? Minimum wage: How high could the lowest salaries go? Premier League clubs 'should pay real living wage' to staff Some 6,000 organisations are now signed up to the scheme,external, including new members Crystal Palace Football Club, insurer Hiscox, Welsh Water and London City Airport. They join existing members such as Burberry, the luxury fashion company, and West Ham United Football Club. The Living Wage Foundation said around 210,000 workers will benefit from the increase. Crystal Palace Football Club is one of the latest organisations promising to pay the ""real living wage"" New research by accountancy firm KPMG suggests that the number of UK jobs paying less than the ""real living wage"" has fallen over the past year from 22% to 19%. However, it said 5.2 million jobs pay below the ""real"" living rate. The National Living Wage is a key campaign issue as the UK heads towards the general election on 12 December. An independent report, commissioned by the former Chancellor Philip Hammond, concluded that raising the National Living Wage would have little impact on jobs. The National Living Wage is the legally binding hourly rate for workers aged 25 and over. It was set at Â£8.21 an hour in April 2019 and is reviewed every year just like the National Minimum Wage (for under 25s). The real living wage was devised by charity the Living Wage Foundation. It argues the government's National Living Wage is not high enough to meet workers' needs and encourages employers to adopt to its more generous, independently calculated rate. The Conservative Party has promised to increase the National Living Wage to Â£10.40 by 2024 and to lower the minimum age to 21. Labour said it will immediately lift the hourly rate to Â£10 for everyone aged 16 and over if they win the election. Under the current arrangement,external, workers under 18 are paid Â£4.35 an hour. At the weekend, SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon accused the Tories of short-changing young people with a ""discriminatory"" minimum wage policy. She said the SNP will demand an end to the ""rip-off"" of workers aged under 25. Katherine Chapman, director of the Living Wage Foundation, said while it is ""fantastic"" there is so much focus on wages: ""We have always been working with businesses to take action now rather than waiting for legislation."" Pam Batty, vice president of corporate responsibility at Burberry, said: ""We are calling on all companies to join the pledge, as we know it will meaningfully improve the lives of their people, who are their most valuable asset.""

Fifth of young people bullied in past year - study,"A fifth of young people in the UK have been bullied in the past 12 months, an annual report has found. Three out of four people who were bullied said it affected their mental health and nearly half became depressed as a result, according tothe study by charity Ditch the Label,external. These figures were almost identical to those from last year's survey. Children's commissioner for England, Anne Longfield, said ""more needs to be done"" in light of the ""worrying"" data. More than 2,000 young people aged between 12 and 20 provided responses for the survey about their experiences of bullying and the impact it has had on their lives in the past year. It also assessed prejudice-based views including racism, sexism, homophobia, disablism and transphobia in an effort to better understand bullying behaviour. Ditch the Label is an international charity supporting young people aged 12 to 25 to help tackle the ""root issues"" around bullying. Its annual survey has become its ""flagship"" piece of research, chief executive officer Dr Liam Hackett said. The seventh annual survey found: The most common type of bullying was verbal, with cyberbullying the least common Of those bullied, 33% said that they had suicidal thoughts, while 41% were left feeling anxious Some 62% were bullied by a classmate and 37% by someone at school they did not know Nearly two-thirds (59%) believed attitudes towards their appearance were the likely cause of bullying In the majority of cases, male respondents were more likely to exhibit negative attitudes than females Ms Longfield said the impact bullying has on children can be ""enormous"", affecting their confidence, self-esteem and mental health. ""More needs to be done at home and in schools to help those who are the victims of bullying and also, crucially, to prevent children from bullying in the first place,"" she added. Some children who were bullied described cyberbullying as a major part of the problem, with one 14-year-old boy adding: ""I go to school and get bullied. Go home and online and still get bullied. I can't ever escape it."" Others cited teachers' unhelpful reaction to bullies, with one 15-year-old boy saying his teacher was homophobic: ""Whenever anyone in class makes comments, they just laugh and do nothing about it."" I was racially abused - then my school tried to suspend me LGBT pupil negative comments 'often unchallenged' Surge in 'vulnerable' teenagers in care The report comes as analysis of NHS figures suggests the health service cancelled 175,000 mental health appointments for children and young people in the past year. Mental health charity Mind has published data indicating a 25% increase in the number of cancelled or postponed appointments for young people accessing Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services. It suggests 175,094 appointments were cancelled or postponed by the NHS service between August 2018 and July 2019 compared with 140,327 in the same period the year before. Mind said the figures were taken from the NHS Digital Mental Health Services Data Set.

The woman who stood up to a witch-hunt,"A young woman accused of witchcraft by Puritan ministers appeals to Satan to save her Would you have stood up to a witch-hunt? In 1597, a Glasgow woman called Marion Walker did just that, taking on the most powerful and vengeful men in the land. Marion Walker used the methods of the modern day whistleblower. She obtained, copied and leaked documents. She wanted the guilty held to account for the horrors of the Glasgow witch-hunt, a shocking miscarriage of justice even by the standards of the day. We know more about her thanks to Dr Daniel MacLeod of the University of Manitoba. He came across Marion as he researched the networks of resistance of the city's Catholics. ""She's a clear and active resister of the new Protestant religion over three decades,"" Dr MacLeod says. ""She's a widow, she's not wealthy but she's got an ability to be heard."" Marion was not afraid to take on any foolhardy minister who dared to upbraid her. An illustration depicts a woman being burned at the stake for the crime of engaging in witchcraft Her Glasgow wasn't like Glasgow today. For one thing, says Dr MacLeod, it was tiny, ""maybe even half the size of modern day Fort William"". Yet it became the stage for one of the worst excesses of the Scottish witch-hunt. Innocent people were being falsely accused by an utterly bogus witch-finder and put to death. The witch-finder was also a woman - the so-called ""Great Witch of Balwearie"", Margaret Aitken. She'd been arrested for witchcraft in Fife and tried to save her skin by claiming she could identify other witches just by looking in their eyes. The authorities, including King James VI, saw her as a new super-weapon in the war on Satan, and soon terrified Glaswegians were being led out in front of this desperate individual. People were being strangled and burned at the stake because of her evidence. A group of supposed witches being beaten in front of King James Then as the witch-hunt went on, someone had a bright idea. Take the people Margaret condemned one day and bring them back the next in different clothes and a different order. The great witch turned witch-finder failed to recognise them, condemning and exonerating a different selection. It dawned on the ministers and magistrates that what they really had was a horrifying fraud. They'd killed people for nothing. They ran for cover. And this is where Marion stepped up. She wasn't going to let the ministers get away with this, particularly not John Cowper, the Great Witch's most zealous promoter. Cowper was a thin-skinned vengeful individual. ""He was not very popular"" says Dr MacLeod. ""But I think he did a lot of it to himself."" Marion wanted to take him down. Through her networks of resistance she managed to get her hands on the most incriminating document of all, the final confession of the Great Witch herself where she pointed her finger at Cowper and blamed him for all that he had done. The church wanted to hush it up -  so Marion circulated it. Cowper was livid. Thanks to Marion, the confession was passing hand-to-hand, making sure Glaswegians knew exactly who to blame for the deaths of their innocent friends and relatives. To strike back at her, he mobilised his fellow ministers to back him up. According to Dr MacLeod: ""The presbytery passed this act threatening the branks for any who blamed the ministry of the city for putting to death the persons lately executed for witchcraft."" The use of branks torture devices was first recorded in Scotland in 1567 The branks were literally a gag - the scold's bridle - with a metal cage for the head and often with a prong to stop the mouth. But in the end they backed off. They didn't dare gag Marion. ""It would go on almost a cycle,"" said Dr MacLeod. ""Marion would 'slander' Cowper, he would call her before the presbytery and it would go on like that, but the root of it was this confession and her role in passing it around."" But wasn't Marion putting herself in danger of being prosecuted as a witch? Dr MacLeod thinks people were a bit more sophisticated than that. ""They knew she wasn't a witch but a defender of wrongfully-accused women,"" he said. Marion lived to fight another day against the Protestant ministry. She became a prominent supporter of the Jesuit, John Ogilvy, who was eventually martyred, but despite being linked to him by multiple witnesses she survived that too. In the fevered religious environment of the time, it took courage to harbour a hunted man. Dr MacLeod said: ""A lot of times when we think about women in the early modern religious context we think of this quiet, meek kind of devotion but that is not Marion Walker.""

State of emergency declared in fire-hit Australia,"Thousands of people have been driven from their homes Two Australian states have declared a state of emergency as bushfires bring a ""catastrophic"" threat to heavily populated areas of the nation's east. At least three people are dead and thousands have been displaced by three days of dangerous weather conditions in New South Wales (NSW) and Queensland. But officials say the worst danger will come on Tuesday for areas around Sydney, the nation's largest city. More than 120 bushfires are burning across the two states. In NSW, the blazes have scorched 970,000 hectares of land and destroyed 150 houses. Nine homes have been razed in Queensland. ""Everybody has to be on alert no matter where you are and everybody has to assume the worst and we cannot allow complacency to creep in,"" NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian said on Monday. Is climate change to blame for Australia's fires? Early Australian bushfires 'an omen for summer' Climate emergency 'clear and unequivocal' Have you been affected by the bushfires? Share your experiences by emailinghaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external. Australia's conservative government has refused to be drawn on whether climate change could have contributed to the fires, in a response that has drawn criticism. ""My only thoughts today are with those who have lost their lives and their families,"" said Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Sunday. NSW fire authorities have issued the maximum level of warning for the first time since new fire warnings were introduced a decade ago, afterAustralia's deadly Black Saturday disaster. The ""catastrophic"" warning is in place across the greater Sydney area and regions to the city's north and south. Temperatures are expected to reach 37C by Tuesday. Conditions are predicted to be worse than on Friday, when the firestorms began tearing through eastern Australia. ""Under these conditions, these fires will spread quickly and threaten homes and lives,"" NSW Rural Fire Service said in a statement. The danger is currently less severe in Queensland, but officials there say conditions could deteriorate later in the week. This video can not be played ""Unprecedented"" bushfires turn skies orange Thousands of people in both states spent the night in evacuation centres while officials assessed whether it was safe for them to return home. On Monday, NSW followed Queensland in declaring a state of emergency - a move which grants fire officials additional powers, such as control over government agencies. Hundreds of schools will be shut down across NSW on Tuesday. Firefighters from New Zealand have been flown in to help as weary emergency crews prepare for a fresh onslaught. A man surveys the destruction on his property in Torrington, NSW Australian PM Scott Morrison (left) with Owen Whalan, a NSW resident who was evacuated Mr Morrison says the military could also be called upon to support the 1,300 firefighters working in the two states. Hundreds of civilians have also volunteered to help in affected areas. While clearing affected areas on Friday, fire crews discovered the body of one victim in a burnt-out car near Glen Innes, about 550km (340 miles) north of Sydney. He was identified by local media as George Nole. Vivian Chaplain, 69, was found suffering from severe burns in Wytaliba, a nearby town. She was rushed to hospital but died shortly afterwards. Carol Sparks, the mayor of Glen Innes, said on Sunday that the town's residents were traumatised. ""The fire was as high as 20 ft [6m] and raging with 80 km/h [50 mph] winds,"" she told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. ""It was absolutely horrific for the people that were impacted."" About 1,000 firefighters have been tackling the blazes across New South Wales The bushfires have left many areas shrouded in smoke On Saturday, NSW police confirmed that a third person - Julie Fletcher, 63 - had died after a body was found in a burnt-out home near Taree, a town about 300km north of Sydney. Two firefighters were injured when a tree fell onto their truck in the Nambucca Heads area of NSW, officials said. They were treated at the scene and transferred to hospital in a stable condition. Crews have fought hundreds of fires in the state since last month, when two people died while trying to protect their home. Earlier this month, a blaze burned though 2,000 hectares of bush which contained a koala sanctuary.Hundreds of the animals were feared to have died. Rains lashed NSW last week, providing relief for many farmers. But the storms were not nearly enough to end the long-running drought. Authorities in the state warn that many fires will continue to burn unless there is more rain. More than 100 fires are raging across NSW and Queensland ""We just cannot overstate the profound impact that the drought is having on fire behaviour,"" NSW Rural Fire Services Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons told reporters on Friday. Farmers - Australia's 'unlikely' climate activists Living with the strain of a devastating drought Water-bombing aircraft are often flying long distances because of the difficulty of accessing water in dry areas. In some cases authorities have drilled bores to keep up with demand. ""We've very mindful of the scarcity of water and how precious it is, but the reality is we can't do firefighting without water,"" Mr Fitzsimmons said. Australia's fire season risks growing longer and more intense due to climate change, according to scientists. This video can not be played Why Australia bushfires are now ""hotter and more intense"" Officials have confirmed that 2018 and 2017 were Australia's third and fourth-hottest years on record respectively, and last yearthe nation experienced its warmest summer on record. The Bureau of Meteorology'sState of the Climate 2018 report said climate change had led to an increase in extreme heat events,externaland increased the severity of other natural disasters, such as drought. Even if global temperatures are contained to a 2C rise above pre-industrial levels - a limit set out in the landmark Paris accord, agreed by 188 nations in 2015 -scientists believe the country is facing a dangerous new normal. Last year,a UN report said Australia was falling short in efforts to cut its CO2 emissions. Have you been affected by the bushfires? Share your experiences by emailinghaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external.

'Unprecedented' weather doubles grass fire calls,"This video can not be played Grass fires: a Long hot summer is blamed for rise in blazes ""Unprecedented and prolonged"" hot weather have been blamed for the number of grass, woodland and crop fires doubling in Wales last year. Wales' three fire authorities tackled 4,015 blazes from April 2018 to March 2019, compared with 2,090 in 2017-18. The head of a Wales-wide fire education initiative said ""unique weather"" meant more people were outside, with issues including discarded barbecues. Deliberately set blazes also rose significantly. Newly-released Welsh Government figuresshed light on challenges faced,externalby Wales' fire and police authorities last year. The number ofarson-related fires was 2,612 in 2015-16before Operation Dawns Glaw - aimed at reducing incidents - was set up. The Llantysilio fires could be seen for miles It is a collaboration between Wales' three fire services and four police forces. Chairman Mydrian Harries said through engaging with communities and schools, it helped cut the numbers to 1,627 in 2017-18. But for 2018-19, the number went back up to 2,850. Grass fires still burning across Wales Fire services count costs of Wales' summer wildfires ""These figures clearly show that with all the will, determination and a hugely successful collaborative task force in place, sometimes uncontrollable factors such as the weather can have a significant impact on our success,"" said Mr Harries. Looking at 2018-19 compared with the year before, forces attended 230% more incidents of deliberate grass fires in June, 739% more in July, 198% more in August, 167% more in September and 114% more in October. Six properties were evacuated as flames threatened houses in Swansea ""When faced with unprecedented and prolonged dry and hot weather conditions, grassland and vegetation becomes susceptible to ignition and often spreads quickly to create even larger fires that present significant challenges to the fire and rescue services,"" he said. ""Our experience also shows that more people spend time outside during this weather, which also increases the risk of fires starting from discarded barbecues and smoking materials, for example."" While he described the figures as ""disappointing"", he said the weather was the ""biggest contributing factor"" and it did not detract from the project's work. However, it has continued to increase its efforts to educate people and spread the message as widely as possible. Mr Harries said: ""History shows that engaging with young people through targeted interventions, high visibility patrols in vulnerable areas, and education and marketing of safety advice, works. ""Building on this, we have actively focused on the farming community to further educate and inform those responsible for carrying out controlled burns to manage land vegetation in a more controlled and safe manner."" Crews and a helicopter battled a fire on Twmbarlwm mountain for five days In all, 70% of blazes were deliberately set, with 46% of these occurring in July 2018 - when there were nine times as many as in July 2017. Met Office weather data showed July 2018 experienced about 40% more hours of sunshine and about half the rainfall compared with July 2017. Incidents included 15 homes being evacuated as crews fought a mile-long mountain fire at Mynydd Cilgwyn in Carmel, near Caernarfon. One of the biggest fires seen across Wales was at Twmbarlwn mountain, which burned for more than two weeks, while a single fire at Llantysilio in Denbighshire burned for 40 days. More than half of the grassland fires in 2018-19 occurred in south Wales (52%), 32% were in mid and west Wales, and 16% were in north Wales. There were two non-fatal casualties - the last fatality resulting from a grassland fire was in 2007-08.

The party launched its election campaign in Barry on Monday. Mr Slaughter is standing for the party in the Vale of Glamorgan, where the Rhoose airport is located. The party pledges to ""restore and revive devastated communities"" with ""bold, radical policies"". Asked if a Green-led Wales would have an airport, Mr Slaughter told BBC Wales: ""I don't think there's a need for one, personally, so no."" Plaid, Lib Dems and Greens in pro-EU pact in 11 Welsh seats Brexit: Where do the parties stand? Under the party ""we definitely wouldn't see any more expansion"" at Cardiff Airport, he said. ""It's a crime against future generations to be contemplating that. ""We would immediately put a halt to all expansion, start charging tax and aviation fuel and slowly make a just transition to a time we do not need Cardiff Airport."" Cardiff Airport was bought by the Welsh Government in 2013 Earlier he toldClaire Summers on BBC Radio Wales Breakfasthe had not gone as far as calling for it to be scrapped. Mr Slaughter said: ""We are against all airport expansion. It is one of the biggest increasing contributors to carbon emissions. ""We have to look at aviation, and we have to also remember that this is also an equality issue,"" he said. ""The vast majority of flights are taken by a very small number of people. ""The aviation industry is heavily, unfairly subsidised - no tax, no VAT on aviation fuel. ""We cannot carry on with business as usual, and we've seen figures, I think, last week - an increase in the sale of private jets in the UK."" Mr Slaughter said he believed the Greens would cut through with voters. ""We are seeing more and more extreme weather events. Climate emergency is very real, people are aware of it. This has to be the climate election,"" he added. ""Every issue in this election has to be looked at through the lens of the climate emergency. ""That's why we are offering this green, bold vision - our green vision for Wales: an all-encompassing overall view, radical policies which will not only help us meet our decarbonisation targets but transform our lives."" Anthony Slaughter launched his party's campaign in Barry on Monday The party's Brexit policy backs a second referendum - offering either the existing deal or remaining in the EU. Mr Slaughter said was confident remain would ""very strongly"" win a second vote. Meanwhile it is pitching to revive ""devastated communities"" that have ""long suffered"" the effects of an ""unjust industrial transition"" and austerity agenda. Mr Slaughter said the Greens' plans would ""pay for the transformation we need"". Â ""It's all been costed. I can't give details until we see the manifesto. But it'll be progressive taxation,"" he said. ""And there's also the buy-back you get from these things - these things bring money in. You reduce air pollution, you increase health, you reduce the burden on the NHS. So over the years there is an investment that comes back."" Mr Slaughter is standing for the Greens in the Vale of Glamorgan - the party hasagreed a pro-EU electoral pactwith Plaid Cymru and the Liberal Democrats. Candidates will stand aside for each other in 11 of the 40 constituencies in Wales to increase the chances of a remain-supporting MP being elected. Under the deal, the Greens will stand aside in the 10 other seats but will be the only one of the three parties standing in the Vale of Glamorgan. Other candidates standing in the Vale of Glamorgan for the 12 December general election include Alun Cairns for the Conservatives and Belinda Loveluck-Edwards for Labour. The close of nominations is 14 November. Russell George, Welsh Conservative economy spokesman, said:  ""To say that Wales does not need an airport is both short-sighted and narrow minded. ""Not only is Cardiff Airport a national airport and now a major regional hub - including direct flights across Europe, and to the Middle East - but it is also a major employer for south Wales and beyond, and attracts passengers from this region, across Mid-and West Wales, and England.""

Police shoot man in Hong Kong day of chaos,"This video can not be played This Hong Kong protester's shooting was livestreamed on Facebook Two people are in critical condition after another day of violent demonstrations in Hong Kong. A protester was injured on Monday morning when he was shot at close range by a police officer. He was the third person shot by police since the protests began 24 weeks ago. Later on Monday a pro-Beijing supporter was doused in flammable liquid and set alight after arguing with protesters, who are demanding greater democracy and police accountability in Hong Kong. The territory's Chief Executive Carrie Lam, speaking at a news conference on Monday evening, called the demonstrators enemies of the people. ""If there's still any wishful thinking that by escalating violence, the Hong Kong government will yield to pressure, to satisfy the so-called political demands, I'm making this statement clear and loud here: that will not happen,"" she said. There were clashes across Hong Kong on Monday between protesters and police, who fired rubber bullets and tear gas. At one point, tear gas was fired in the central business district - a rare occurrence during working hours on a weekday. Protesters built barricades in Causeway Bay The violence also prompted a warning from a senior Chinese newspaper editor at a tabloid published by the state-owned People's Daily. Addressing Hong Kong police, Hu Xijin wrote: ""You have the backing of not only the Hong Kong and Chinese people, but also Chinese soldiers and the People's Liberation Army in Hong Kong,"" Reuters news agency reported. ""They can go into Hong Kong to provide support at any time."" Monday's violence followed a weekend of vigils and protests aftera 22-year-old student protester died on Friday.Alex Chow had been in hospital since he fell from the ledge of a car park during a police operation a week ago. The protests started in June against a now-withdrawn plan to allow extradition to mainland China, but have since morphed into wider demonstrations. The shooting occurred as protesters tried to block a junction at Sai Wan Ho on the north-east of Hong Kong Island. Police confirmed that one officer ""discharged his service revolver"" and that a man was shot. Footage posted on Facebook showed the officer drawing his gun before grappling with a man at a roadblock. When another man approached wearing a face mask, the officer fired at him, hitting him in the torso. The officer fired twice more, but there were no injuries. After the shooting, footage showed the 21-year old protester lying with his eyes wide open and with blood around him. Hong Kong protests explained in 100 and 500 words Student death sparks impromptu protests Hong Kong protest leader 'attacked with hammers' He has undergone surgery and remains in a critical condition, a Hospital Authority spokesman told the BBC. The police said officers also drew firearms from their holsters in two other places. Police in Sai Wan Ho, after the shooting happened But they denied what they called ""totally false and malicious"" reports that officers were ordered to ""recklessly use their firearms"" in Monday's operations. It was the third time a police officer had shot someone with live rounds.The first incident was during protests on 1 Octoberwhen China was celebrating 70 years of communist rule. The second case was a teenage boy shot in the leg on 4 October. Stephen McDonell, BBC China correspondent, at the scene The pedestrian crossing in Sai Wan Ho, where the young protester was shot, has become a site of considerable tension. Activists have built barricades across the junction - and when riot police come they face a torrent of abuse from bystanders of all ages. Blood can still be seen on the street - and next to it graffiti reading ""we shall never surrender"". Each time the riot police leave, the demonstrators return to erect their barricades again. Hong Kong's political crisis - now in its fifth month - continues to become more violent. The unnamed man was doused in a flammable liquid after getting into a dispute with protesters in Ma On Shan, about 20km (12 miles) north of the business district. It is unclear what started the argument, news agency AFP reported. Video being shared online shows the man, who is wearing green, tell the protesters ""none of you are Chinese"". The protesters respond by telling him to ""go back to the Greater Bay Area"", which is a part of the Chinese mainland across the border from Hong Kong. Tear gas was fired in the central business district - a rare occurrence on a weekday The man was then set alight in what Chief Supt John Tse said was the ""most shocking incident"". ""The man is now admitted to hospital in critical condition and the case is under investigation by the regional crime unit of New Territories South,"" he told reporters. Most protests have taken place at weekends, but pro-democracy activists have called out all workers for a general strike on Monday. Other incidents have included: At the Chinese University, police fired rubber bullets in response to protesters throwing bricks At Hong Kong Polytechnic, police fired tear gas at a demonstration Protesters used barricades to block roads in various places, leading to long traffic jams. MTR railway stations were also targeted Police say protesters dropped ""large and heavy objects"" on roads, endangering drivers In one video circulating online, a police motorcycle seems intentionally to ram into protesters Police described the activists as ""radical protesters"", conducting ""extensive illegal acts"" and urged them to stop any actions that threatened safety and obstructed the police. Several universities have cancelled their classes for the day. Hong Kong is part of China but as a former British colonyit has some autonomy and people have more rights. The protests started in June against plans to allow extradition to the mainland - which many feared would undermine the city's freedoms. The bill was withdrawn in Septemberbut demonstrations continuedand now call for full democracy and an inquiry into police behaviour.

Labour and Tories vow to aid forces personnel,"This video can not be played Armed forces personnel deserve ""a proper wage"" - Thornberry The Conservatives and Labour parties will mark Armistice Day with pledges to improve the lives of UK service personnel and their families. The Tories say they would change the law to protect veterans from ""vexatious"" legal action, if they win 12 December's general election. They are also promising extra childcare for military families and a new railcard for veterans. Labour is promising improved support for forces children and better wages. And the Liberal Democrats want to waive leave to remain fees for armed forces personnel who were born outside the UK. In other election developments: The Brexit Party leader Nigel Faragehas announced his party will not stand candidatesin the 317 seats won by the Conservatives at the 2017 general election Conservative cabinet minister Michael Gove claims Labour now backs ""uncontrolled immigration"", in anarticle for the Times,external The Lib Dems areproposing a Â£10,000 fund for all adultsto pay for skills training Labour's Keith Vaz hasannounced he will not be standing for re-election, after being suspended from the Commons by its standards watchdog Labour, in a storyfirst reported by the Mirror,external, is promising to spend Â£845m a year on improving children's mental health, including a counsellor for every school It is the first time since 1923 that Armistice Day - commemorating the end of World War One - has fallen during a general election campaign. Speaking ahead of a trip to the Midlands to meet forces personnel, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: ""As we remember the ultimate sacrifice made by our brave men and women for their country just over a century ago, it is right that we renew our commitment to the soldiers, sailors, marines, airmen and veterans of today."" Mr Johnson has pledged to change the law to protect forces veterans from ""vexatious"" legal action, if the Conservatives win a majority at the election. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: ""After a decade of government cuts and outsourcing, Labour offers our armed forces real change with the pay, conditions and respect they deserve."" Mr Johnson said the party will introduce legislation to ensure the Law of Armed Conflict has primacy and that peacetime laws are not applied to service personnel on military operations. Under the proposals, the Tories would amend the Human Rights Act so it does not apply to issues - including deaths during the Troubles in Northern Ireland - that took place before it came into force in 2000. The pledge comes as six former soldiers who served in Northern Ireland during the Troubles are facing prosecution. The cases relate to the killings of two people on Bloody Sunday in Londonderry in January 1972; as well as the deaths in separate incidents of Daniel Hegarty, John Pat Cunningham; Joe McCann and Aidan McAnespie. Not all of the charges are for murder. The Public Prosecution Service in Northern Ireland has said that of 32 so-called Troubles legacy cases it has taken decisions on since 2011, 17 related to republicans, eight to loyalists, and five are connected to the Army. Boris Johnson met veterans on Monday during a visit to Wolverhampton Defence Secretary Ben Wallace told BBC Radio 4's Today programme any changes would not affect current criminal prosecutions brought against service personnel, but in future, those who wanted to pursue complaints against the forces would have to go to the European Court of Human Rights rather than UK courts. ""At the moment, because of the Human Rights Act, people can go via our courts and use our systems to constantly reopen this and we don't think that is right or fair,"" he said. But members of both the Ulster Unionist Party and Sinn FÃ©in in Northern Ireland have criticised the pledge. The UUP's Doug Beattie - a retired Army captain - said it would allow for ""terrorists... to get away scot-free"", while Sinn FÃ©in's Linda Dillon said it was ""unacceptable"" to give soldiers, past and present, ""immunity"". Irish Deputy Prime Minister Simon Coveney also said the proposal was ""very concerning"", tweeting: ""The law must apply to all, without exception, to achieve reconciliation."" Conservative plans to exempt British troops from human rights laws during combat were first announced in 2016 by Mr Johnson's predecessor, Theresa May, but they have yet to be put into law. The Tories are also promising to extend the school day for forces children aged 4 to 11, and a guaranteed job interview for any public sector role veterans apply for. The party has also announced plans for a new Veterans' Railcard offering a third off rail fares. A HM Forces Railcard can already be bought by serving personnel for Â£21 a year. This isn't the first time the Conservatives have promised to end what they've called ""vexatious legal claims and prosecutions against British soldiers accused of wrongdoing on the battlefield"" - such as allegations of abuse or unlawful killing. The past four Tory defence secretaries have all pledged to introduce legislation to protect serving personnel and veterans, but have so far failed to deliver. The thorniest issue has been what to do with killings and deaths that took place during the Troubles in Northern Ireland. The Tories now believe they might have a solution by amending the Human Rights Act so it does not apply to incidents before 2000. But recent history has shown any change will be easier said than done. Labour, meanwhile, isrestating pledges it made in June,externalfor Armed Forces Day to improve support for forces children with better access to schools and dedicated local authority admissions strategies to help with frequent school moves. The party says its plan to scrap the public sector pay cap will boost the income of the lowest paid members of the forces. According to Labour analysis, the starting salary of a private is Â£1,159 lower in real terms than in 2010. Armed forces pay was frozen to an increase of 1% between 2013 and 2017 by Conservative-led governments. The independent Armed Forces Pay Review Board recommended a 2.9% rise for 2018/19, which the government chose to implement as a 2% increase with a 0.9% one-off payment. Labour is also promising to provide ""decent housing"" for forces personnel and their families by ending the reliance on the private rented sector. Jeremy Corbyn took part in the silence in his Islington constituency Labour's shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, said it was time to pay service personnel a ""proper wage"", adding: ""We ask them to make the ultimate sacrifice. The least we can do is offer them decent pay."" She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""We are going to make sure that our armed forces are looked after properly because we don't think that they have been until now. ""And on a day a like today, I think it is very important to emphasise the priority that we will be giving to our Armed Forces, our veterans and their families."" Jeremy Corbyn has been talking about the starting pay for an army private, which has fallen after taking account of rising prices since 2010. That's the salary you get after you've been assigned to a unit and completed training. Mr Corbyn was using figures calculated before the government introduced a larger-than-usual increase in April 2019. The starting salary in 2010 was Â£17,015, which in 2019 money would be Â£20,650. The starting salary since April has been Â£20,000, so it has clearly fallen in real terms, but not by the Â£1,200 he cited. The Lib Dems said leave to remain fees - the payment made when someone born outside the UK wants to stay in the country - had been ""increased to exorbitant levels"" and ""prevented many brave veterans from taking up their right to settle in the UK with their families"". The cost is currently Â£2,389 per person, and the party has pledged to scrap that for veterans. The Lib Dem's defence spokesman, Jamie Stone, said: ""These men and women risk their lives in the service of our country, and the fact they are treated this way by the Conservative Party is yet another horrible example of the hostile environment. ""A Liberal Democrat government will waive the outrageous application fees for members of the armed forces on discharge and their families.""

"Speed limits for ships can have 'massive' benefitsCutting the speed of ships by 20% can benefit health, protect whales and limit warming, say campaigners.Science & Environment","Cutting the speed of ships has huge benefits for humans, nature and the climate, according to a new report. A 20% reduction would cut greenhouse gases but also curb pollutants that damage human health such as black carbon and nitrogen oxides. This speed limit would cut underwater noise by 66% and reduce the chances of whale collisions by 78%. UN negotiators will meet in London this week to consider proposals to curb maritime speeds. Ships, of all sorts and sizes, transport around 80% of the world's goods by volume. However they are also responsible for a significant portion of global greenhouse emissions thanks to the burning of fuel. Shipping generates roughly 3% of the global total of warming gases - that's roughly the same quantity as emitted by Germany. While shipping wasn't covered by the Paris climate agreement, last yearthe industry agreedto cut emissions by 50% by 2050 compared to 2008 levels. Amazon profits hit by rising shipping costs Climate emergency 'clear and unequivocal' Climate change alters red deer gene pool Thisnew study,external, carried out for campaign groups Seas at Risk and Transport & Environment builds on existing research that suggests that slowing down ships is a good idea if you want to curb greenhouse gases. The report though also considers a range of other impacts of a speed cut such as on air pollution and marine noise. As ships travel more slowly they burn less fuel, which means there are also savings in black carbon, sulphur and nitrogen oxides. The last two in particular have serious impacts on human health, particularly in cities and coastal areas close to shipping lanes. The report found that cutting ship speed by 20% would cut sulphur and nitrogen oxides by around 24%. There are also significant reductions in black carbon, which are tiny black particles contained in the smoke from ship exhausts. Slowing ships down would cut the amount of fuel burned Cutting black carbon helps limit climate warming in the Arctic region because when ships burn fuel in the icy northern waters, the particles often fall on snow, and restrict its ability to reflect back sunlight, which accelerates heating in the Arctic region. The study also says that a 20% cut in speed would reduce noise pollution by two thirds - while the same speed limitation would reduce the chances of a ship colliding with a whale by 78%. ""It's a massive win, win, win, win,"" said John Maggs from Seas at Risk. ""We've got a win from a climate point of view, we've got a win from a human health point of view, we've got a win for marine nature,  we've got a potential safety gain, and up to a certain point we are saving the shipping industry money. ""It is also of course by far the simplest of the regulatory options. Thanks to satellites and transponders on commercial vessels it really is quite easy to track their movements and the speed they are travelling."" Proposals to reduce the speed of ships are among the ideas that will be considered at this week's meeting of the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) in London. Experts believe that in the medium to long term, the industry will move to alternative fuels. But there is considerable pressure, including from many countries and shipping companies, for effective short term measures to curb emissions. One proposal from France would focus on oil tankers and bulk carriers but not container or cruise ships. Denmark is proposing that the industry has a goal-based standard, where it is up to the individual shipping companies as to how they meet it. Many shipping companies are in favour of slowing down. ""Slow steaming not only reduces the fuel costs but its application does not require time-consuming procedures as it can be implemented instantly, it requires no investment from ship owners, can be easily monitored and is the most efficient means of slashing CO2 emissions,"" said Ioanna Procopiou, a Greek shipping company owner. But the idea is not supported by some of the biggest names in the trade. ""Maersk remains opposed to speed limits,"" said Simon Christopher Bergulf, who is Regulatory Affairs Director with the giant Danish shipping conglomerate. ""We rather support the principle of applying power limitation measures. Focusing on power instead of speed limits will help deliver on the CO2 reduction targets set by the IMO, whilst rewarding the most efficient ships."" What gives campaigners hope is that shipping has already tried out the concept of going slow - back in 2008, during the global financial crisis, cargo ships slowed down to cut costs. With average speeds dropping by 12% this helped cut daily fuel consumption by 27%, which equated to a significant drop in emissions. Campaigners believe that whatever decision the IMO eventually comes to will involve slower steaming. ""The short term measure, whatever it is, is going to reduce ship speed,"" said John Maggs. ""We think the best way to do this most effectively is with a direct speed limit, whether we get that or not is unknown, but ships will have to slow down in the future.""

"Woody Allen settles movie deal lawsuit with AmazonThe director signed a four-film deal, but Amazon Studios withdrew after his comments about #MeToo.","Woody Allen had filed a $68m (Â£52m) lawsuit over the termination of his contract with Amazon Woody Allen has reached a legal settlement with Amazon Studios after it abandoned a four-film deal. Allen initially filed a $68m (Â£52m) lawsuit in February amid resurfaced allegations that he molested his adopted daughter. Amazon argued that his comments about the #MeToo movement ""sabotaged"" its attempts to promote his new movies. The film director denies sexually assaulting Dylan Farrow, who lost a court case against him in 1992. Under the movie deal, signed in 2016, Allen received a $10m advance payment. But two years later, the release of his first film, A Rainy Day in New York, was shelved and plans for three other movies were cancelled. Shortly before Amazon withdraw from the agreement, Allen reportedly expressed sympathy for movie producer Harvey Weinstein, who was accused of sexually assaulting dozens of women. Mr Weinstein denied the accusations against him, but has since reached a $44m settlement with some of the alleged victims. Months after these initial comments, Allen accused Dylan Farrow of ""cynically using the #MeToo movement"" after she repeated allegations that he assaulted her when she was seven years old. Moses Farrow defends Woody Allen Woody Allen: I'm #MeToo's poster boy In an interview with Argentinean broadcaster Eltrece, Allen said he ""should be the poster boy for the Me Too movement"" since he had worked with ""hundreds of actresses"" and was ""only accused by one woman in a child custody case"". Amazon Studios said its decision to terminate the deal was justifiedbecause Allen's comments undermined its financial security. Dylan Farrow claims her father sexually abused her in 1992 It also pointed out that ""scores of actors and actresses expressed profound regret for having worked with Allen in the past, and many declared publicly that they would never work with him in the future"". In response, Allen said Amazon was fully aware of Dylan Farrow's accusation when the deal was signed. His company, Gravier Productions, secured an international release for A Rainy Day in New York this year, but US distribution has not been secured. Timothee Chalamet and Rebecca Hall, who star in the film, said last year that they would donate their wages to charity.

Police officer shoots protester in Hong Kong,"This video can not be played This Hong Kong protester's shooting was livestreamed on Facebook Two people are in critical condition after another day of violent demonstrations in Hong Kong. A protester was injured on Monday morning when he was shot at close range by a police officer. He was the third person shot by police since the protests began 24 weeks ago. Later on Monday a pro-Beijing supporter was doused in flammable liquid and set alight after arguing with protesters, who are demanding greater democracy and police accountability in Hong Kong. The territory's Chief Executive Carrie Lam, speaking at a news conference on Monday evening, called the demonstrators enemies of the people. ""If there's still any wishful thinking that by escalating violence, the Hong Kong government will yield to pressure, to satisfy the so-called political demands, I'm making this statement clear and loud here: that will not happen,"" she said. There were clashes across Hong Kong on Monday between protesters and police, who fired rubber bullets and tear gas. At one point, tear gas was fired in the central business district - a rare occurrence during working hours on a weekday. Protesters built barricades in Causeway Bay The violence also prompted a warning from a senior Chinese newspaper editor at a tabloid published by the state-owned People's Daily. Addressing Hong Kong police, Hu Xijin wrote: ""You have the backing of not only the Hong Kong and Chinese people, but also Chinese soldiers and the People's Liberation Army in Hong Kong,"" Reuters news agency reported. ""They can go into Hong Kong to provide support at any time."" Monday's violence followed a weekend of vigils and protests aftera 22-year-old student protester died on Friday.Alex Chow had been in hospital since he fell from the ledge of a car park during a police operation a week ago. The protests started in June against a now-withdrawn plan to allow extradition to mainland China, but have since morphed into wider demonstrations. The shooting occurred as protesters tried to block a junction at Sai Wan Ho on the north-east of Hong Kong Island. Police confirmed that one officer ""discharged his service revolver"" and that a man was shot. Footage posted on Facebook showed the officer drawing his gun before grappling with a man at a roadblock. When another man approached wearing a face mask, the officer fired at him, hitting him in the torso. The officer fired twice more, but there were no injuries. After the shooting, footage showed the 21-year old protester lying with his eyes wide open and with blood around him. Hong Kong protests explained in 100 and 500 words Student death sparks impromptu protests Hong Kong protest leader 'attacked with hammers' He has undergone surgery and remains in a critical condition, a Hospital Authority spokesman told the BBC. The police said officers also drew firearms from their holsters in two other places. Police in Sai Wan Ho, after the shooting happened But they denied what they called ""totally false and malicious"" reports that officers were ordered to ""recklessly use their firearms"" in Monday's operations. It was the third time a police officer had shot someone with live rounds.The first incident was during protests on 1 Octoberwhen China was celebrating 70 years of communist rule. The second case was a teenage boy shot in the leg on 4 October. Stephen McDonell, BBC China correspondent, at the scene The pedestrian crossing in Sai Wan Ho, where the young protester was shot, has become a site of considerable tension. Activists have built barricades across the junction - and when riot police come they face a torrent of abuse from bystanders of all ages. Blood can still be seen on the street - and next to it graffiti reading ""we shall never surrender"". Each time the riot police leave, the demonstrators return to erect their barricades again. Hong Kong's political crisis - now in its fifth month - continues to become more violent. The unnamed man was doused in a flammable liquid after getting into a dispute with protesters in Ma On Shan, about 20km (12 miles) north of the business district. It is unclear what started the argument, news agency AFP reported. Video being shared online shows the man, who is wearing green, tell the protesters ""none of you are Chinese"". The protesters respond by telling him to ""go back to the Greater Bay Area"", which is a part of the Chinese mainland across the border from Hong Kong. Tear gas was fired in the central business district - a rare occurrence on a weekday The man was then set alight in what Chief Supt John Tse said was the ""most shocking incident"". ""The man is now admitted to hospital in critical condition and the case is under investigation by the regional crime unit of New Territories South,"" he told reporters. Most protests have taken place at weekends, but pro-democracy activists have called out all workers for a general strike on Monday. Other incidents have included: At the Chinese University, police fired rubber bullets in response to protesters throwing bricks At Hong Kong Polytechnic, police fired tear gas at a demonstration Protesters used barricades to block roads in various places, leading to long traffic jams. MTR railway stations were also targeted Police say protesters dropped ""large and heavy objects"" on roads, endangering drivers In one video circulating online, a police motorcycle seems intentionally to ram into protesters Police described the activists as ""radical protesters"", conducting ""extensive illegal acts"" and urged them to stop any actions that threatened safety and obstructed the police. Several universities have cancelled their classes for the day. Hong Kong is part of China but as a former British colonyit has some autonomy and people have more rights. The protests started in June against plans to allow extradition to the mainland - which many feared would undermine the city's freedoms. The bill was withdrawn in Septemberbut demonstrations continuedand now call for full democracy and an inquiry into police behaviour. Clashes between police and activists have become increasingly violent and in Octoberthe city banned all face masks. Are you in the area? Are you involved in the protests?

"Apple's 'sexist' credit card probed by regulatorGoldman Sachs, which operates Apple Card, discriminates between men and women, it is claimed.","A US financial regulator has opened an investigation into claims Apple's credit card offered different credit limits for men and women. It follows complaints - including from Apple's co-founder Steve Wozniak - that algorithms used to set limits might be inherently biased against women. New York's Department of Financial Services (DFS) has contacted Goldman Sachs, which runs the Apple Card. Any discrimination, intentional or not, ""violates New York law"", the DFS said. The Bloomberg news agency reported on Saturday,externalthat tech entrepreneur David Heinemeier Hansson had complained that the Apple Card gave him 20 times the credit limit that his wife got. In a tweet, Mr Hansson said the disparity was despite his wife having a better credit score. Later, Mr Wozniak, who founded Apple with Steve Jobs, tweeted that the same thing happened to him and his wife despite their having no separate bank accounts or separate assets.

Banks and other lenders are increasingly using machine-learning technology to cut costs and boost loan applications. But Mr Hansson, creator of the programming tool Ruby on Rails, said it highlights how algorithms, not just people, can discriminate. US healthcare giant UnitedHealth Group is being investigated over claims an algorithm favoured white patients over black patients. Mr Hansson said in a tweet: ""Apple Card is a sexist program. It does not matter what the intent of individual Apple reps are, it matters what THE ALGORITHM they've placed their complete faith in does. And what it does is discriminate."" He said that as soon as he raised the issue his wife's credit limit was increased. The DFS said in a statement that it ""will be conducting an investigation to determine whether New York law was violated and ensure all consumers are treated equally regardless of sex"". ""Any algorithm that intentionally or not results in discriminatory treatment of women or any other protected class violates New York law."" The BBC has contacted Goldman Sachs for comment. On Saturday, the investment bank told Bloomberg: ""Our credit decisions are based on a customer's creditworthiness and not on factors like gender, race, age, sexual orientation or any other basis prohibited by law."" The Apple Card, launched in August, is Goldman's first credit card. The Wall Street investment bank has been offering more products to consumers, including personal loans and savings accounts through its Marcus online bank. The iPhone maker markets Apple Card on its website as a ""new kind of credit card, created by Apple, not a bank"". Leo Kelion, Technology desk editor Without access to the Goldman Sachs computers, it's impossible to be certain of what is going on. The fact there appears to be a correlation between gender and credit doesn't necessarily mean one is causing the other. Even so, the suspicion is that unintentional bias has crept into the system. That could be because when the algorithms involved were developed, they were trained on a data set in which women indeed posed a greater financial risk than the men. This could cause the software to spit out lower credit limits for women in general, even if the assumption it is based on is not true for the population at large. Alternatively, the problem might lie in the data the algorithms are now being fed. For example, within married couples, men might be more likely to take out big loans solely using their name rather than having done so jointly, and the data may not have been adjusted to take this into account. A further complication  is that the software involved can act as a ""black box"", coming up with judgements without providing a way to unravel how each was determined. ""There have been a lot of strides taken in the last five to six years to improve the explainability of decisions taken based on machine learning techniques,"" commented Jonathan Williams of Mk2 Consulting. ""But in some cases, it's still not as good as it could be."" In any case, for now Apple would prefer Goldman Sachs take the heat, despite the fact its marketing materials state that its card was ""created by Apple, not a bank"". But that's a tricky position to maintain. Apple's brand is the only one to feature on the minimalist styling of its card's face, and many of its consumers have higher expectations of its behaviour than they would do for other payment card providers. That means that even if issues of gender bias prove to be common across lenders, Apple faces becoming the focal point for demands that they are addressed.

This could cause the software to spit out lower credit limits for women in general, even if the assumption it is based on is not true for the population at large. Alternatively, the problem might lie in the data the algorithms are now being fed. For example, within married couples, men might be more likely to take out big loans solely using their name rather than having done so jointly, and the data may not have been adjusted to take this into account. A further complication  is that the software involved can act as a ""black box"", coming up with judgements without providing a way to unravel how each was determined. ""There have been a lot of strides taken in the last five to six years to improve the explainability of decisions taken based on machine learning techniques,"" commented Jonathan Williams of Mk2 Consulting. ""But in some cases, it's still not as good as it could be."" In any case, for now Apple would prefer Goldman Sachs take the heat, despite the fact its marketing materials state that its card was ""created by Apple, not a bank"". But that's a tricky position to maintain. Apple's brand is the only one to feature on the minimalist styling of its card's face, and many of its consumers have higher expectations of its behaviour than they would do for other payment card providers. That means that even if issues of gender bias prove to be common across lenders, Apple faces becoming the focal point for demands that they are addressed.
